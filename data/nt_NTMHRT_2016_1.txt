Re AB [2016] NTMHRT 1 (30 March 2016)
NORTHERN TERRITORY OF
Mental Health Review Tribunal
Re AB (a patient)
DECISION NUMBER:
[2016] NTMHRT 1
MATTER TYPE:
Community Management Order/Involuntary
Admission/Adjournment
DECISION OF:
Richard Bruxner, Peter O’Brien, Jill Huck
DELIVERED ON:
30 March 2016
The Mental Health Review Tribunal reviews involuntary
treatment of patients. If a patient subject to an order for involuntary
as an inpatient is admitted as a voluntary patient, the order ceases
to have any effect. In those circumstances there is nothing
for the tribunal to
review and therefore no occasion for it to make any order affecting the patient.
Before the tribunal could make
a community management order for such a patient,
he or she would first need to have been discharged and placed on an interim
management order.
Introduction
its hearings on 23 March 2016 the Mental Health Review Tribunal declined to make
a community management order (‘CMO’)
in respect of patient AB (whose
name has been anonymised for the purpose of these reasons).
circumstances in which the tribunal declined to make the CMO were somewhat
unusual and the hearing panel considered it would be
appropriate for written
reasons to be provided.

Mental Health
and Related Services Act
’) on 18 February
tribunal reviewed AB’s involuntary admission at its hearings on 2 March
2016. On that occasion the tribunal ordered that
AB be detained as an
involuntary patient for a further period of two weeks.
detention pursuant to the 2 March 2016 order again came before the tribunal for
review on 16 March 2016.
the hearing on 16 March 2016 AB’s treating doctors did not seek a
continuation of AB’s involuntary admission. Instead
they applied for a
six-month CMO.
application for a CMO was not finally determined at the 16 March 2016 hearing.
The tribunal instead adjourned the matter to 23
March 2016.
section 129(5A)
, the effect of the adjournment was
that the tribunal’s order on 2 March 2016 continued in force (even though
a CMO was now
being sought).
17 March 2016, an authorised psychiatric practitioner decided that AB no longer
met the criteria for involuntary admission on the
grounds of mental illness and
AB became a voluntary patient.
the hearing on 23 March 2016 the treating doctors were again seeking a six month
CMO in relation to AB.
the hearing commenced, AB’s legal representative noted that AB was now a
voluntary inpatient and wished to
as a voluntary inpatient. On
that basis AB was opposed to the CMO being sought by the treating

. Following
that discussion and a brief adjournment, the tribunal determined that the
application for a CMO would be declined.
determination involved no consideration of the suitability or otherwise of a CMO
in the management of AB’s mental illness.
It instead turned upon the
tribunal’s conclusion that, in the particular circumstances, there was no
legal occasion for the
making of a CMO.
Community Management
are three main avenues by which the tribunal comes to make a
first is where an authorised psychiatric practitioner makes an interim community
management order (‘interim CMO’)
under section 45 of
interim CMO must be reviewed by the tribunal within 14 days of being made
(section 123(2)).
If, upon such a review, the tribunal is satisfied that the
affected person fulfils the criteria for involuntary treatment or care
community, it may make a CMO of up to 6 months duration
(section 123
second is where a CMO previously made by the tribunal is reviewed by it
(pursuant to the obligation to do so under
section 123(1)).
If the Tribunal is
satisfied that the criteria for the making of the CMO are established, it may
make a further order.
third avenue by which a CMO may be made by the tribunal is in the context of a
review of the involuntary admission of a person
(or a review of an existing
tribunal order for involuntary detention). In those circumstances,
would appear to contemplate the making of a CMO instead of an order
for further detention as an involuntary patient.
intention of the treating doctors at the hearing on 16 March 2016 was to seek a
CMO on the latter basis.
however, the matter came on for hearing on 23 March 2016, there had been an
important change. By that time, AB was a voluntary
inpatient. There was no
longer any order relating to AB for the tribunal to review and as such there was
no basis for it to act
section 123.
obstacle created by AB’s changed inpatient status was more than merely
technical. Having admitted AB as a voluntary patient,
the treating doctors must
be taken to have acted according to the procedures and criteria in
. They must therefore have decided that AB was capable of giving
informed consent to the admission as well as being satisfied that
AB was likely
to benefit from the admission.
a decision (contrary to AB’s wishes) to discharge AB would have involved
an opinion that to do so was in AB’s
interests or that AB would not gain
any benefit by prolonging the admission (see
section 29(3)).
was no evidence before the tribunal of any such decision having been
tribunal reviews involuntary treatment of patients. Once AB became a voluntary
inpatient, the previous order for involuntary
detention as an inpatient ceased
to have any effect. This meant there was no longer any involuntary treatment
for the tribunal to
the circumstances, the application for a CMO could not succeed. The appropriate
course, assuming a CMO is still to be sought in
relation to AB, would appear to
be for AB to be discharged (assuming such a discharge would be appropriate
having regard to
section 29(3))
and for an interim CMO subsequently to be made.
