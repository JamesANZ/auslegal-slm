1.2 The committee has identified significant
technical scrutiny concerns in relation to the instrument listed below.
Competition and Consumer
(Notification of Acquisitions) Determination
F2025L00753
The purpose of the instrument is to support the new merger control system
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
by determining: the
circumstances where acquisitions of shares or assets require notification,
exceptions to the general circumstances,
the classes of acquisitions requiring
notification, notification of proposed acquisition forms and the public benefit
application
form, the information and documents required to accompany such
forms, the requirements for applications to the Australian Competition
and certain fees payable under the new system.
Authorising legislation
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
Disallowance
15 sitting days after tabling (tabled in the Senate on
22 July 2025).
Notice of motion to disallow must be given by
27 October 2025.
1.3 The Competition and Consumer (Notification of Acquisitions) Determination
2025 (the instrument) is made under the
Competition and Consumer
(the CCA). The purpose of the instrument is to support
the new merger control system which was introduced into the CCA by the
Treasury Laws Amendment (Mergers and Acquisitions Reform) Act 2024
Under the merger control system, certain acquisitions of shares or assets must
be notified to the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission for assessment
prior to completion.
1.4 The instrument supports the new merger control system, including by
determining the circumstances where acquisitions require notification,
determining certain aspects of the acquisitions register, determining the
notification and public benefit application forms and the
information and
documents required to accompany such forms. This includes
instrument which contains determinations setting out the content and format of
notification forms and the public benefit application
form, prescribed under the
1.5 The committee’s secretariat, on behalf of the committee, sought
advice from the Department of the Treasury in relation to
the instrument on 25
July 2025 and received a response on 7 August 2025. As the committee
retains scrutiny concerns with the instrument,
it has now resolved to raise
those concerns with the Assistant Minister for Productivity, Competition,
Charities and Treasury.
Compliance with authorising
legislation;
exemption from disallowance
1.6 Senate standing order 23(3)(a) requires the committee to scrutinise
each instrument as to whether it is in accordance with its
enabling Act and
otherwise complies with all legislative requirements. This includes whether the
instrument is within the powers
conferred by its enabling Act, so that it is
legally authorised. Further, under Senate standing order 23(4A), the
committee may scrutinise
instruments that are not subject to disallowance,
including whether it is appropriate for them to be exempt.
1.7 The explanatory statement to the instrument provides that
made pursuant to paragraphs 51ABY(5)(a) and 51ABZQ(5)(a) of the CCA and
determines (in section 6-
) the content and format of notification of proposed
acquisition forms prescribed under section 51ABY of the CCA.
determines (in section 6-
) the content and format of the public benefit
application form prescribed under section 51ABZQ of the CCA. The explanatory
to the instrument states that sections 51ABY and 51ABZQ of the CCA
specify that any determination made pursuant to these sections
is exempt from
disallowance under section 42 of the
Legislation
(the Legislation Act) and, as such, Part 6 of the
instrument is exempt from disallowance. However, the remainder of the instrument
appears to be disallowable.
1.8 Paragraph 44(2)(a) of the Legislation Act provides that a provision
of an instrument may be exempt from disallowance, as it states
section 42 (disallowance) does not apply in relation to ‘a
legislative instrument, or a provision of a legislative instrument’
Act declares or has the effect that section 42 does not apply in relation
to the instrument or provision. In this instance,
subsections 51ABY(7) and
51ABZQ(6) of the CCA expressly state that ‘a determination’ made
under subsection 51ABY(5) or
51ABZQ(5) is ‘a legislative instrument’
and that section 42 of the Legislation Act does not apply to ‘the
instrument’.
It therefore appears that the intention of subsections
51ABY(7) and 51ABZQ(6) is to apply to a standalone instrument, and to require
that ‘the instrument’ which determines matters under those
provisions be wholly exempt from disallowance. It is therefore
unclear to the
committee whether the CCA authorises the exemption of only Part 6 of the
instrument from disallowance and whether
doing so is contrary to the intention
of subsections 51ABY(7) and 51ABZQ(6) of the CCA.
1.9 In light of the above, the committee requests the assistant
minister’s advice as to the legal basis for exempting only Part
instrument, rather than the instrument as a whole, from disallowance.

Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation, Competition
and Consumer (Notification
of Acquisitions) Determination 2025,
Legislation Monitor 5 of 2025
; [2025] AUSStaCSDLM 186.
In the event of any change
to Senate sitting days, the last day on which a notice of motion to disallow
must be given would also
change accordingly. The committee notes that the
explanatory statement to the instrument indicates that Part 6 of the instrument
is exempt from disallowance.
