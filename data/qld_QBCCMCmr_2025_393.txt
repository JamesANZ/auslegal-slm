INTERIM ORDERS
application for interim orders is dismissed
REASONS FOR DECISION
Application
applicant is seeking three specific interim orders from an
adjudicator:
1. That the Body Corporate engage a suitably qualified
engineer within 14 days to inspect the full length of the retaining wall and
fence behind Lot 21 and immediately implement all necessary safety
recommendations. These recommendations should include, but not
be limited to,
temporary safety fencing, stabilization, and erosion-control works.
2. That the Body Corporate preserve and provide copies of all records
relating to the wall, fence, and gardening contracts to both
the applicant and
the Commissioner within 14 days. This is urgent because months of refusal risk
the loss or alteration of evidence
before adjudication.
3. A temporary restriction on new commitments or non-urgent payments to the
conflicted gardening contractor pending determination,
requiring any genuinely
urgent safety works to proceed only via an independent contractor.
[2] The interim
orders sought by the applicant relate to a failing retaining wall and fence
behind the Lot 21 private yard. The applicant
says it poses a
of injury or property damage and
requests that the Body Corporate
immediately engage an independent engineer to assess the structure and
implement necessary safety
measures, such as temporary stabilization and
erosion control.
[3] Further, the
application seeks the preservation and disclosure of all relevant
records to prevent the loss or alteration of evidence,
and a temporary
restriction on payments to a gardening contractor, who she says, is related
to the Secretary.
applicant explains that the delay in lodging this application was due to the
Body Corporate's failure to take action to replace
the retaining wall and
fence. The applicant also claims that the Body Corporate committee has not
provided her with access to engineering
and says that as a
result it is now necessary to obtain
urgent protective orders to
safeguard life and property.
[5] Poinciana
Park CTS 26589 was constructed around 26 years ago and consists of a number of
buildings including Building K, comprising
lots 21 and 22 which each have a
private yard at the rear of their lot with a timber fence approximately 1.8M in
height. There is
further common property beyond the rear fence, which falls
down to a small creek and bushland area.
private yards are retained by a timber sleeper retaining wall, about 1 metre in
height, below the 1.8M timber
The land then slopes down
for a further 1.8 metres (approx) to a boulder retaining wall which is
approximately 3 metres in height.
applicant says that both the timber retaining wall and fence behind Lot 21 have
deteriorated badly and require replacement.
Key concerns raised by the applicant
include approximately 600 mm of soil erosion and a collapsing fence now less
than 1 metre from
a structural post supporting the lot 21 balcony. The applicant
believes that if the wall fails, there is a risk to life
property damage. She says that despite repeated warnings since March 2025, no
temporary safety works have been undertaken.
committee has sought advice from Booth Engineering regarding replacement of the
retaining wall. However the applicant notes
that in their correspondence from
October 1 2025, they stated that they were unable to comment on the danger
within the applicant's
lot because the Committee had refused them access, even
though the applicant had repeatedly offered entry. Booth had recommended
1-meter exclusion zone along the top of the retaining wall. The wall is now
described as visibly failing and unsafe, especially
in heavy rain.
applicant stated they decided to lodge this application upon learning that
although the engineer had identified a potential
wall failure, the Committee had
no immediate intention of implementing safety measures.
application asserts that the delay in lodging this application was directly
caused by the Committee’s failure to act
or cooperate. The applicant
reported the issue on March 4, 2025, and repeatedly followed up and requested
formal records (under s205
of the Act). These requests were reportedly met with
delays or refusals. The applicant says they delayed escalation, hoping to
the matter internally and trusting that the Committee would act if an
engineer identified a safety risk.
applicant also raises concerns regarding the Body Corporate’s gardener,
David Henderson, who is the husband of the
Secretary (Katie Henderson). The
applicant says that:
• Payments to David Henderson have
allegedly never been ratified or disclosed.
• The Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairperson are friends and have served
together for about seven years.
• EGM paperwork sought to ratify payments to David Henderson for the
last four years and included his new tender, but excluded
the applicant’s
previously provided motions.
• The EGM voting papers issued 8 October 2025 seek to ratify payments
dating back to 2021 and present David Henderson’s
quote as the cheapest by
excluding the full cost of green-waste disposal, which is included in other
Interim Submissions from Committee
[12] Pursuant to
my investigative powers under section 271 of the Act, the body corporate
committee was invited to make submissions
regarding the interim outcomes sought
by the applicant.
committee acknowledges that the deterioration and movement of the retaining
wall and fence is a major issue is for the body
corporate. However the
Committee says it is attending to the matter and outlines a timeline of engaging
engineers and seeking funding
approval for preparatory work. It also says that
no immediate structural risk has been identified.
committee also addresses other concerns raised by the applicant,
including access to records, gardening services, the Lot
owner's unapproved installation of a
and retrospective approval of a deck. Ultimately, the
Committee asserts that its actions have been reasonable, transparent, and
with its statutory obligations, despite the complexity of the ongoing
[15] The core
structural issue involves deterioration and movement of the retaining wall and
fence between the Lot 21 private yard
and the common property creek-side area,
first reported by the owner on 4 March 4, 2025.
Committee says it promptly took action, including consulting a building
contractor, obtaining legal advice from Hynes Legal,
and commissioning Booth
Engineers. Following preliminary soil testing, Booth Engineers advised that
soil-stability testing was required.
Due to the projected cost, approval for
this testing was submitted to an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 3
November 2025 .
Committee says no engineer or contractor has identified any immediate structural
risk requiring emergency works. However,
following advice from Booth Engineers
on 30 September 2025, the Committee restricted access behind the wall for a
distance equal
to its height and requested Lot 21 remove items attached to the
fence (like plants, shade sails, and pipes).
Committee believes the applicant had prior knowledge of retaining-wall movement
and soil instability as early as 2020. Correspondence
from August 2025 indicates
that the applicant constructed a small Besser-block retaining wall within their
lot to protect their property
from ongoing subsidence. The Committee suggests
that any observed deterioration may have been influenced by the delay in
and these unapproved private works.
Committee also detailed its position on two specific installations made by the
applicant (owner of Lot 21):
• Deck (2020): The owner sought
retrospective approval for a timber deck, claiming it was self-assessable under
Brisbane City
Council guidelines. The Committee granted conditional approval,
placing full responsibility for all costs, future repairs, maintenance,
liability, and compliance on the Lot Owner.
Gate (2025): In August 2025, the owner installed a gate in the
shared dividing fence without prior approval. The Committee issued
direction requiring the owner to either remove the gate and reinstate the fence
or provide proof of qualified installation,
insurance, and accept ongoing
responsibility for maintenance and liability, citing non-compliance with by-laws
and safety requirements.
Committee noted that structural changes, such as the installation of the deck
adjacent to the retaining-wall zone, may impact
local soil and drainage
conditions.
Access to Records
committee says the applicant was advised multiple times that access to records
is available under section 205 of the Act,
either through inspection at the Body
Corporate Manager’s office or by requesting copies of specific documents
and payment
of the statutory fee. The Committee states it has not refused
committee says Gardening services are performed by the Secretary’s spouse
month-to-month, at rates below the market
average. The arrangement was approved
by majority vote, and the Secretary has abstained from all related decisions.
Competitive quotes
were obtained for the 2025 EGM to market-test the pricing.
Committee addressed an exhibit
containing previously unprovided information, confirming an arrangement
involving the gardener and the owner of Unit 11 was independent
of BC invoicing.
Owner Motions
committee says the motions submitted by Lot 21 on September 24, 2025, were
treated as Committee motions and will be responded
to within the statutory six
week period.
Committee maintains that the retaining-wall issue is being managed
professionally and transparently, subject to required
funding approval, and
asserts that its responses to the owner’s complaints regarding record
access and alleged conflict of
interest are consistent with its statutory
obligations.
[26] At this
point in time I am considering the application for three interim orders which
can be summarised as follows:
1. That the Body Corporate engage an
engineer within 14 days to inspect the retaining wall and fence behind Lot 21
and implement safety
measures including temporary safety fencing, stabilization,
and erosion-control.
2. That the Body Corporate preserve and provide copies of all records
relating to the wall, fence, and gardening contracts to both
the applicant and
the Commissioner within 14 days.
3. A temporary restriction on new commitments or non-urgent payments to the
body corporate gardener pending determination, requiring
any urgent safety works
to proceed only via an independent contractor.
[27] As I am now
considering an application for interim outcomes, the only issue to decide at
this time is whether an interim order
is warranted.
[28] Section
of the Act provides that:
An adjudicator may make an
order that is just and equitable in the circumstances (including a declaratory
order) to resolve a dispute,
in the context of a community titles scheme,
(a) a claimed or anticipated contravention of the Act or the community
management statement; or
(b) the exercise of rights or powers, or the performance of duties, under the
Act or the community management statement; or
(c) a claimed or anticipated contractual matter about-
(i) the engagement of a person as a body corporate manager or service contractor
for a community titles scheme; or
(ii) the authorisation of a person as a letting agent for a community titles
[29] An order
may require a person to act, or prohibit a person from acting, in a way stated
in the order
(section 276(2)).
An adjudicator's order may contain
ancillary and consequential provisions the adjudicator considers necessary or
appropriate
(section 284(1))
[30] Further,
section 279 provides that:
(1) The adjudicator may make an interim order if satisfied, on reasonable
grounds, that an interim order is necessary because of
the nature or urgency of
the circumstances to which the application relates.
adjudicator may stop the body corporate from carrying out work on common
property until a dispute about the irregularity of
proceedings has been
investigated and resolved.
2. The adjudicator may stop a general meeting
deciding or acting on a particular issue until it has been investigated and
(2) An interim order
(a) has effect for a period (not longer than 1 year)
stated in the order; and
(b) may be extended, varied, renewed or cancelled by
the adjudicator until a final order is made; (c) may be cancelled by a later
order made by the adjudicator; and
(d) if it does not lapse or is not
cancelled earlier, lapses when
(i) the application is withdrawn; or
the commissioner gives the person who made the application a written notice
under section 241 rejecting the application; or
(iii) a final order is made
by an adjudicator to whom the application is referred. ...
[31] As outlined
above, the applicant is seeking both interim and final orders. The only issue at
this time is whether an interim
order is warranted. Any order granted must be
just and equitable.
order will not be granted unless it is necessary due to the nature or urgency of
the circumstances.
The examples in
the Act indicate the usual circumstances where an interim order might be made
are in the nature of injunctive relief.
An applicant must establish that the
circumstances warrant an interim order. An interim order will not be made if
the only urgency
is a desire to expedite the dispute.
[32] In order to
make an interim order an adjudicator must be satisfied an applicant has
established that it has a prima facie
and the balance of convenience
between the parties justifies injunctive
That is, an adjudicator
must balance the inconvenience of granting relief now if final orders are
ultimately refused, against the
inconvenience of refusing relief now if final
orders are ultimately granted. Of particular relevance is evidence an interim
is necessary to prevent serious or irreparable harm.
[33] The case of
SDW2 Pty. Ltd. V JLF Corporation Pty Ltd
[2017] QSC 1
provides some
guidance as to when it would be appropriate to make an interlocutory injunction
at paragraph [21]:
The legal principles governing the disposition
of an application for interlocutory injunction were discussed by me in
Managed Investments Ltd v Tolteca Pty Ltd
[2015] QSC 234
at 3 to 5 and again
Tribal Health Pty Ltd v Flush Fitness Pty Ltd
[2016] QSC 103.
latter case I summarised relevant principle in these terms (at [23]):
(a) The law in Australia has long regarded it to be necessary to make two
main inquiries: (i) whether the applicant has shown that
it has a prima facie
case; and (ii) whether the applicant has shown that the balance of convenience
favours the granting of the relief
(b) The significance of the requirement that a prima facie case be shown is
elaborated upon in
Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O’Neill
(2006) 227 CLR 572
Live Earth Resource Management Pty Ltd v Live
[2007] FCA 1034
(c) The considerations brought to bear on the balance of convenience
requirement were the subject of discussion in Australian
Broadcasting
Corporation v O’Neill
Bowen Central Coal Pty Ltd v Aquila Coal
[2011] QCA 334
, the latter case clarifying that the adequacy of an
award of damages and the question of the sufficiency of the usual undertaking
were to be considered as part of the totality of the balance of convenience
(d) The progression of the two main inquiries is not a mechanical exercise.
Whether the relief sought is prohibitory or mandatory,
the Court should take
whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn
out to have been “wrong”
in the sense of granting an injunction to a
party who fails to establish his right at an ultimate trial, or in failing to
injunction to a party who succeeds at trial. In making that decision,
the Court should weigh in the balance all relevant factors,
including matters
pertaining to the strength of the case to be tried and the balance of
convenience.
[34] The issue
of most concern is the condition of the retaining wall and fence behind Lot 21.
As stated above, the private yard
for lot 21 is retained by a timber sleeper
retaining wall, about 1 metre in height. There is a 1.8M timber fence
immediately above
the timber retaining
The land then slopes down
from the timber retaining wall for about a further 1.8 metres to a boulder
retaining wall which is approximately
3 metres in height.
Committee says that after the applicant contacted them on 4 March 2025 regarding
the collapsing retaining wall, it promptly
took action, including consulting a
building contractor on 19 March 2025. The building contractor recommended that
they obtain engineering
advice, and on 20 March 2025, they consulted Booth
[36] From a
perusal of provided documentation, it is evident that
Booth Engineers advised that soil-stability testing
was required. On 30 May 2025, Booth Engineers engaged Geotest Engineering to
a site classification of the
Geotest Engineering
undertook testing using hand tools to a maximum depth of 3.6 m and their
outlines that the timber
retaining wall was constructed on non-engineered fill soil. They therefore
classified the site of the retaining
wall as Class “ P ” site in
accordance with Australian Standard 2870-2011 “ Residential Slabs and
Footings. ”
[37] Based on
the Geotest findings, Booth Engineers recommended that specialist Geotechnical
Engineers be engaged to undertake a detailed
geotechnical investigation
including drilling, laboratory testing and assessment of landslide
susceptibility. The Committee then
sourced the following three quotations for
the soil stability testing:
1. Soil Surveys - $7,040.00
2. Douglas Partners - $7,381.00
3. PTG - $3,333.00 plus the
a provisional
amount of $2,000.00 for extra works,
a variation
provision of $1,908.50 for Test Holes and a variation provision for $5,000.00
for a special drilling rig
a variation
provision for $3,500.00 for retention design and
[38] In my view
the body corporate committee has acted promptly to obtain advice from
construction and engineering professionals regarding
replacement of the
retaining wall.
[39] Classification
of a site as Class “ P ” under AS 2870 indicates that the site is
problematic and has abnormal or
unstable foundation conditions
unsuitable for standard footing
It is evident
that the presence of fill and slope instability mean that additional engineering
investigation and design is required
to ensure the footing system will perform
satisfactorily for many years to come.
[40] The final
design will depend on recommendations of a qualified Geotechnical Engineer but
it is evident from preliminary investigations
that the footing design will most
probably require specific structural engineering design and
certification.
This necessarily
involves delays and additional cost, but it is important that the work is done
properly to produce a structurally
sound, lasting solution.
[41] While the
applicant complains that no temporary safety works have been undertaken, they do
not indicate what type of safety works
are required. The Committee says no
engineer or contractor has identified any immediate structural risk requiring
emergency works.
In any event, I note that following advice from Booth Engineers
on 30 September 2025, the Committee restricted access behind the
distance equal to its height and requested Lot 21 remove items attached to the
fence (like plants, shade sails, and pipes).
Given that the area retained is
the applicant’s private yard it is difficult to see what additional
precautions could be undertaken.
[42] I also note
that in an email dated 30 September 2025, Booth Engineers advised the applicant
as follows:
Given the retaining wall is failing this is always a
risk of damage / failure occurring to anything within the zone of influence
the wall as a result. As a matter of general advice we usually recommend
in these instances that if failure has been identified that
access should be
limited to the area directly above the retaining wall for a distance at least
equal to the height of the wall (i.e
for a 1m high wall do not access within 1m
horizontal behind the top of the wall) until such time as rectification /
replacement
of the retaining wall has occurred.
[43] Having
regard to the foregoing, I do
believe it is appropriate to make an
interim order requiring the that the Body Corporate engage an engineer within 14
days to inspect
the full length of the retaining wall and fence behind Lot 21
and immediately implement all necessary safety recommendations.
[44] Secondly,
the applicant seeks an interim order that the Body Corporate preserve and
provide copies of all records relating to
the wall, fence, and gardening
contracts to both the applicant and the Commissioner within 14 days.
[45] I note that
on 24 September 2025 the applicant wrote to the body corporate manager in the
following terms:
“Pursuant to section 205 of the BCCM Act, I
formally require, within 7 days of this notice, copies of all Body Corporate
(including but not limited to committee and general meeting minutes,
motions, correspondence, quotes, invoices, contracts, and conflict-of-interest
declarations) that:
-relate to the retaining wall and fence, including any engineering,
inspection or repair proposals, and
-relate to the gardening contract, including any tenders, approvals,
payments, and any actual or perceived conflicts of interest.
In addition, I specifically request all
historical records from the date the current gardening contractor was first
engaged to the
present that concern:
-the initial appointment, tendering or approval of the gardening contract,
-any extensions, renewals or amendments of that contract, and
-all conflict-of-interest declarations, abstentions from voting, or related
correspondence at any time since the gardener was first
For the avoidance of doubt, this is a request for the committee or its
manager to identify and provide the relevant records directly
to me. It is not a
request to merely grant access for me to inspect or search through the entire
record set myself.”
Committee says it has not refused the applicant access to records of the body
corporate. It says the applicant was advised
multiple times that access to
records is available under section 205 of the Act, either through inspection at
the Body Corporate
Manager’s office or by requesting copies and payment of
the statutory fee.
[47] Having
reviewed the correspondence between the applicant and the body corporate, my
preliminary view is that the applicant has
not been denied access to body
corporate records.
[48] A body
corporate is not expected to trawl through voluminous records to identify
information which may satisfy a vague request
for information. A person seeking
copies of records should clearly identify the documents or classes of documents
they seek (for
example, correspondence sent on behalf of the body corporate
between specified dates, or invoices paid in particular financial years
specified services). If a person is not able to adequately specify a request,
they would need to inspect the records themselves
to locate documents of
[49] Therefore I
do not propose to make the second requested interim order.
[50] The third
requested interim order is
a temporary restriction on new commitments or
non-urgent payments to the body corporate gardener pending determination,
any urgent safety works to proceed only via an independent
contractor.
applicant says the Body Corporate’s gardener, David Henderson, is the
husband of the Secretary, Katie Henderson and
that payments to David Henderson
have allegedly never been ratified or disclosed.
response, the body corporate says the Secretary abstained from any decisions
relating to gardening, which were decided by
majority vote of the committee. In
their view the gardening arrangements are transparent and cost-effective.
Further, they say that
four competitive quotes were obtained for consideration
at the 2025 EGM to market-test pricing and allow owners to decide which
they wish to engage to undertake the gardening work.
[53] I am not
satisfied that Mr Henderson is disqualified from contracting with the body
corporate to provide gardening services,
provided that the arrangement is at
arms length. I also accept the committee’s advice that Mrs Henderson has
abstained from
any committee decision relating to engagement of Mr Henderson to
undertake gardening work.
[54] In any
event, at this point in time I am considering an application for interim orders
and I have not been provided with any
persuasive evidence to indicate that there
is good reason for urgent intervention to stop Mr Henderson from undertaking
work, pending the outcome of the application for final orders.
[55] I have
therefore dismissed the application for interim orders. The application for
final orders remains outstanding. This application
will now be administered in
accordance with the Act and the normal processes of this office. Submissions
will be sought from the
Respondent and affected parties before final orders are
