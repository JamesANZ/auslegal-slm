seeks an award of costs against the complainant.
Act provides, in s 26(1):
(1) The Tribunal may make an order for costs in
proceedings in accordance with the scale prescribed for that purpose—
(a) if in the opinion of the Tribunal the proceedings are frivolous or
vexatious; or
(b) if in the opinion of the Tribunal the proceedings have been instituted or
prosecuted for the purpose of delay or obstruction;
(c) if in the opinion of the Tribunal there are other good reasons for doing

question of what constitutes frivolous proceedings has been the subject of
judicial determination over a long period of time,
in many different contexts.
In the context of an application for the summary dismissal of proceedings on the
basis that they were
frivolous, in
General Steel Industries Inc. v
Commissioner for Railways (NSW) And
The test to be applied has been variously expressed; "so
obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed"; "manifestly groundless";
"so manifestly faulty that it does not admit of argument"; "discloses a case
which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed"; "under
no possibility can there be
a good cause of action"; "be manifest that to allow them" (the pleadings) "to
stand would involve useless
At times the test has been put as high as saying that the case must be so plain
and obvious that the court can say at once that the
statement of claim, even if
proved, cannot succeed; or "so manifest on the view of the pleadings, merely
reading through them, that
it is a case that does not admit of reasonable
argument"; "so to speak apparent at a glance".
As I have said, some of these expressions occur in cases in which the inherent
on statutory rules of court
but although the material available to the court in either type of case may be
different the need for
exceptional caution in exercising the power whether it be
inherent or under statutory rules is the same. Dixon J. (as he then was)
sums up a number of authorities in
Victorian Railways
Commissioners
where he says: "A case must be very clear indeed to justify
the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting
for determination in the appointed manner by the court with or without a jury.
The fact that a transaction is intricate
may not disentitle the court to examine
a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether
the proceeding
amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious. But once it
appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact
and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for
the court to dismiss the action as frivolous
and vexatious and an abuse of
process." Although I can agree with Latham
C.J. in the same case when he
said that the defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance of
useless and futile proceedings,
in my opinion great care must be exercised to
ensure that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the
appointed tribunal. On the other hand, I do not think that the exercise
evoke the futility of the plaintiff's claim.
Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable
that it cannot possibly succeed.

NSW Industrial Relations Commission, in
Peden v Lake Macquarie Refrigeration
in the context of an
application for costs, after referring to
General Steel Industries
In light of the well established line of authority, and
the ordinary meaning of the word “frivolous”, we are satisfied
an application under s 84 will be frivolous if, on its face, it cannot possibly
succeed, if it is manifestly groundless or if
it is a paltry or trifling
Ms Ramstrom’s complaint was not manifestly groundless, and nor was it
paltry or trifling. The complaint was not frivolous.
the Commission relied
upon the description of “vexatious” from the decision of
Roden J in the Supreme Court of NSW in
Attorney-General v
It seems then that litigation may properly be regarded as vexatious for present
purposes on either objective or subjective grounds.
I believe that the test may
be expressed in the following terms:
Proceedings
are vexatious if they are instituted with the intention of annoying or
embarrassing the person against whom they are brought.
are vexatious if they are brought for collateral purposes, and not for the
purpose of having the court adjudicate on the issues
for which they give
are also properly to be regarded as vexatious if, irrespective of a motive of a
litigant they are so obviously untenable or manifestly
groundless as to be
utterly hopeless.
is no basis for a finding that the complainant’s claim was vexatious.
Both “frivolous” and “vexatious”
mean a great deal more
than “unsuccessful”.
The respondent’s application for costs under s 26(1)(a) will be
submitted that the finding by the Tribunal that some of Ms Ramstrom’s
allegations were untrue, together with the
finding that other allegations had
not been proven to the requisite standard of proof, was a sufficient basis for
an award of costs
under s 26(1)(c) of the Act. It seems to us that there
is a very good reason that the Act provides, as it does, in s 26, for a
basis upon which costs may be awarded, rather than providing for the
unsuccessful party to pay the costs of the successful party
before the Tribunal.
The reason is one of public policy. The preamble of the Act says that it
An Act to promote equality of opportunity between the
citizens of this State; to prevent certain kinds of discrimination based on
race, disability, age or various other grounds; to facilitate the participation
of citizens in the economic and social life
of the community; and to deal with
other related matters.
limitation on the circumstances in which costs may be awarded is intended to
limit the extent to which a complainant might be
discouraged from pursuing a
claim under the Act before the Tribunal by reason of the likely expense in
pursuing it. Bearing that
in mind, in all of the circumstances of this case, we
do not consider that it would be appropriate to make an order for costs pursuant
to s 26(1)(c) of the Act.
