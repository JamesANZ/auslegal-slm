[2023] QIRC 105
Reasons for Decision
[1] The Workers'
Compensation Regulator ('the Regulator') caused a Notice of Non-Party
Disclosure ('NNPD') to be issued to Services
Australia on 30
October 2025,
disclosure of documents relating to the Appellant in substantive proceedings
(WC/2025/196).
October 2025, the Regulator also filed an application within proceedings seeking
approval pursuant to
Industrial Relations Act 2016
to vary the NNPD so that the documents sought would be provided directly to the
Queensland Industrial Relations Commission
('QIRC') rather than requiring
Services Australia to provide the documents directly to the requesting party, or
the individual to
whom the documents relate.
[3] Attached to
the application was email correspondence from Services Australia dated
30 May 2023, arising from a different Workers
Compensation
Appeal, confirming they would not object to any applications by
the Regulator made to the QIRC in the above terms and
not seek to make submissions. The same correspondence was
attached as Exhibit A to the affidavit sworn by Ms Ruth Moroney in
support of the
application.
[4] The parties
to the substantive proceeding confirmed they did not intend to make
submissions in relation to this application.
Commission advised it
would proceed to determine the application on the material
Why the variation is required
[6] The history
of disclosure by Services Australia in
Workers Compensation Appeals is explained
by DP Hartigan in
Collins v Workers' Compensation
It was accepted in
that matter that Services Australia is bound by the requirements of
Health Insurance Act 1973
(Cth) ('Health Insurance Act') and the
National Health Act 1953
(Cth) ('National Health Act')
and that it would be unlawful for the relevant officers of
Services Australia to produce records directly
to the Regulator.
[7] In that
case, her Honour determined it would be appropriate to vary
the NNPD to require the material to be provided directly to
QIRC. In forming that view, her Honour noted the submission of
the Regulator that the variation would serve the dual purpose
of undertaking
discovery while ensuring that discovery complies
National Health
is appropriate in the present matter to adopt the same
approach to ensure the efficient conduct of this proceeding.
[9] For these
reasons I allow the application and order
accordingly.
Notice of Non-Party Disclosure addressed to Services Australia, issued on 30
October 2025, be varied by requiring the documents
sought in the Notice to be
produced directly to the Queensland Industrial Registry with respect to
proceedings WC/2025/196, within
14 days; and
Workers' Compensation Regulator is directed to immediately serve a copy of this
decision on Services Australia.
Pursuant to r 64B of the
Industrial Relations (Tribunals) Rules 2011
Affidavit of Ruth Moroney
filed 30 October 2025.
