Some tiny ships connecting Australia with Asia and the Pacific in the gold rush years
Some tiny ships connecting Australia with
Asia and the Pacific in the gold rush years
This article deals with four sailing vessels ranging from 37 to 148 tons
launched between 1842 and 1867 by the prominent early colonial
ship-builder,
William Paterson. It concentrates on their contacts with Australia’s
Pacific and Asian neighbours. Each was built
at a different site and was
intended to operate in coastal waters and river estuaries linking Launceston,
Melbourne and Adelaide.
However, strong local competition in the gold-rush years
was greatly exacerbated by the abolition of Britain’s restrictive
Navigation Laws in 1849 and an increased use of steamers in Bass Strait, causing
their skippers to venture as far as California,
Guam, the Chatham Islands or
This article is based on voyages into the Pacific and Indian Oceans by
four little ships built in Australia by William Paterson between
1842 and 1867.
The smallest, the cutter
, was all of 37 tons. The largest was the

of 148 tons. Why these craft? William Paterson was my
mother’s great-grandfather, hence the effort to track his ships’
movements over many years and on many seas. The Paterson brothers (William and
John) did launch larger vessels (to 547 tons), but
these were normally involved
in longer-distance service and did not usually link Australia with its Pacific
and Asian neighbours.
Vessels treated here were Paterson’s small
A brief reference to the types of vessels on the shipping register of the
Port of Sydney in 1849 will provide important context. There
were 235 ships on
that register, 189 built in New South Wales and the remainder in Britain or
other British colonies. Not one fully
square-rigged ‘ship’ was on
the register and the two largest barques were the
(386 tons) and
(345 tons). Only 24 sailing vessels were of 200 tons or
more, most of these being British built. The great majority of smaller craft
(under 100 tons) were Australian built, and the 98 schooners and 55 cutters
taken together represented well over half the total.
The largest steamer
registered was the
of 362 tons.

Although the four vessels discussed here were built by William Paterson, no
two were constructed at the same place. All were intended
for short-range
voyaging in Bass Strait or adjacent waters linking with Kangaroo Island and
Adelaide. They were all of shallow draught
to negotiate river estuaries. A
passage from Launceston to Melbourne involved over forty miles of river estuary
at the Launceston
end, and negotiating the tortuous and sometimes shallow Yarra
River into the heart of old Melbourne at the other end. The reasons

to be built in South Australia.
Given that his ship-building in Australia began at Encounter Bay when it was
still an isolated whaling settlement, it is likely that

new shipyard on the swamp near Launceston’s first bridge, in 1844. The
brigantine or schooner
is next, having been launched at
Paterson’s later shipyard near the old Blackwall Point Jetty, West Tamar,
in 1848. The brigantine
or schooner
Emma Paterson
, launched in 1868 on
the Cam River estuary west of modern Burnie is next treated. Both latter vessels
appear alternatively as ‘brigantine’
or ‘schooner’.
Given minor differences in rigging between a brigantine and a topsail schooner,
each possibly tried both
forms at different times.
From the earliest period of European settlement sailing ships maintained
essential links between Australian colonies and their Asian
and Pacific
neighbours. In the earliest period of white settlement this was necessary to
avoid starvation. In those earliest times,
when the East India Company held a
monopoly over Australia’s international trade and when the possible escape
of convicts from
Australia was greatly feared, ocean-going ships were not
permitted to be built in these colonies. However, by the 1840s, ship-building
flourished. Australian-built ships that crossed the Pacific to the Californian
goldfields, carried Australian timber cargoes as far
north as Guam, or regularly
traded with the Dutch and Portuguese East Indies, were tiny vessels originally
designed and built for
coastal use.
The 110 ton brigantine or ‘topsail schooner’

tackled all the voyages listed above. Although of similar

number of voyages between Tasmania
and New Zealand (and even farther into the
Pacific) after 1846. Information on the

operated in New Zealand waters, is scarce. However, one later reference to the
presence in Australian waters suggests that her latter

at Patea, on the coast of New Zealand’s North Island
If we measure in terms of value for money and effort invested in a
ship’s construction, the
must reign supreme among William
Paterson’s nautical creations down under. It is incredible that such a
small vessel should
have carried so much and so varied cargo over formidable
ocean distances between 1842 and 1865. Of those vessels that William Paterson

two decades.

with consignments of soap and candles. That passage
across the Tasman took only

wool. The loss
of the ‘ship’s galley’ challenges the
imagination. It was presumably fixed to the deck, and washed overboard! The
skipper was probably more concerned by his loss of jib-boom.
A trip to and from New Zealand for the
four-man crew
normally meant a month each way on the Tasman, but she was not regarded as an
unusually slow vessel. In April 1848,

Launceston by sailing from Williamstown across Bass Strait to Circular Head

Other times that she made the news columns usually involved being blown ashore

little record in Australian sources. The

with the Port of Melbourne (even when operating for New Zealand owners) and for
a time was owned by David
Mitchell, father of Dame Nellie Melba. Australian
authorities were informed that her registration would be transferred to Dunedin
in 1864, but that did not happen. Her New Zealand owners were named in September
1864 as William Moyse and J. B. Mudie, probably
linked with Dunedin. However,

Melbourne provided problems. Seamen deserted ships in droves, seeking a quick

by sailing ships. Hence

on our rivers north and south of Sydney we had extensive and fine ship-building
yards, producing a class
of vessels equal in durability to the teak ships of
India, and of models that any country might well be proud of. Now, alas! There
is not one colonial vessel on the stocks…Now look at our colonial fleet,

out long before they reached
