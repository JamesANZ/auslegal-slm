People management in the airline industry
Greg J. Bamber
reports on people management in the airline industry.
This article discusses management of people in airlines. It summarises contrasting management models from successful ‘new entrants’
to the aviation industry, Southwest Airlines and Ryanair. It considers examples of older ‘legacy airlines’ and ‘new
entrants’ to the industry. We analyse differences in two aspects of employment relations strategies. First, in their relationship
with employees, airlines can focus on
controlling
employee behaviour or seeking their
to the goals of the airline. Second, in their relationship with unions, airlines can seek to
avoid, accommodate
with them. Although these strategies are illustrated in airlines, they also apply to enterprises in other sectors. This article shows
that, in terms of employment relations, airlines still have considerable scope for exercising strategic choice.
A soon to be published book,
Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees,
by G.J. Bamber, J. Hoffer Gittell, T.A. Kochan, & A. von Nordenflycht, (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY, 2009), includes
much more data and analysis than this article. A series of related articles will also be published in 2009 in the

l of Human Resource Management
In the past, airlines have been highly regulated. Nevertheless, this industry has not always been profitable and many airlines have
Before deregulation, on many international routes there was typically a monopoly, or a duopoly of two legacy national flag-airlines
– one based in the home country of each airport. The US led moves towards deregulation in the 1970s and the UK followed in
the 1980s. Since then Australia and many other countries have deregulated to some extent.
New industry entrants
Two of the largest and most successful new entrants to the airline industry have adopted contrasting management styles. Southwest
Airlines, the first ‘new entrant’, was founded in 1971 in the US. Southwest chose employment relations strategies based
on fostering employee commitment and union partnership. It is more highly unionised than other American airlines. In 2004 Southwest
became the largest airline serving the US and it has been continually profitable each year apart from its first year, an unusual
feat in this industry.Southwest is the longest surviving new entrant and a model that many other firms say they are emulating as
they try to enter the airline industry.
Ryanair was founded in 1985 in Ireland. It was subsequently transformed into a fast-growing highly profitable low-cost airline. Its
employment strategy is to focus on low costs via wage minimisation, union avoidance and employee control, rather than relying on
their commitment. According to an International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) survey, Ryanair is one of only a few airlines
in Europe that does not engage in collective bargaining. It aggressively avoids (suppresses) unions. This has induced the ITF to
launch a web-based campaign (Ryan-be-Fair) attempting to mobilise Ryanair workers to take action against this airline. Nevertheless,
Ryanair has become the new entrant airline leading growth in the European market for cheap, no-frills flights.
One strategy for airlines is to focus on achieving low labour costs by paying the lowest possible wages and benefits, keeping staffing
as lean as possible and avoiding unionisation or limiting union influence if or when employees organise. An alternative option is
to build employee commitment and a partnership with unions. Ryanair is an example of the former approach and Southwest an example
of the latter strategy. These two airlines are the two most influential role models for other new entrants. Both strategies also
include achieving low total costs by increasing employee and aircraft productivity as well as the productivity of other costly assets
such as airport gates.
In the book, we classify airlines in a range of countries according to which strategies dominate their efforts at cost reduction.
Alongside these differences in competitive strategies, we analyse differences in their employment relations strategies.
Airlines in Australia
Australia used to have a “two airline” policy which was, in effect, a duopoly. The domestic mainline routes were shared
between Australian Airlines (later merged with Qantas) and Ansett Airlines. Qantas was founded in 1920 and is Australia’s dominant
airline. Since it was privatised in the 1990s it has generally operated profitably in international and domestic markets. Ansett
was mainly a domestic airline. The strategic position of both of these ‘legacies’ was to offer full service. These airlines
had relatively high operating costs and fares.
Following several short-lived attempts since the 1980s to start a third domestic airline, Impulse and Virgin Blue both launched airlines
in 2000. Brett Godfrey was the co-founder of Virgin Blue Airlines. His team saw Southwest Airlines as a role model.
The almost simultaneous launch of Virgin Blue and Impulse precipitated a price war in which airlines cut fares. Qantas and Ansett
dropped their fares to match the new entrants’ start-up deals. As the legacies had higher costs, the fare reductions were a
challenge for all of the airlines. During this price war, Qantas took over Impulse which it later re-launched as Jetstar and in 2001,
Ansett went bankrupt.
When they began, Australia’s new entrant airlines enjoyed a 30 to 40 per cent cost advantage compared with Qantas. Nevertheless,
unlike many other airlines Qantas has continued to be profitable. This is not least thanks to its successful re-launch of Impulse
as Jetstar, as well as to its strong position in international and corporate markets.
These airlines in Australia have adopted increasingly tough management rhetoric in relation to the unions. Nonetheless, they continue
to accommodate unions, but unlike Southwest, neither Qantas/Jetstar nor Virgin Blue are really partnering with unions. As they have
faced more competition, airlines have implemented aspects of the approaches pioneered by such role models as Southwest and Ryanair.
One paradox is that, simultaneously, the rhetoric from several airlines has emphasised the importance of fostering employee commitment
and customer service, while seeking to reduce employees’ economic rewards and/or to retrench them. However, in contrast to
Qantas and many other airlines around the world, and despite the rise in fuel costs in 2008 Virgin Blue has aimed to avoid retrenching
employees. Its rationale is that it has invested resources in recruiting and training them. But its staffing levels were already
much leaner than those of legacy airlines.
In terms of benefits for employees, some airlines have followed Ryanair (for example AirAsia based in Malaysia, but also flying to
Australia). AirAsia has rejected a partnership approach and has followed an aggressive union avoidance strategy.
Virgin Blue decided at its inception to accommodate selected unions in relation to all categories of its workforce. Since it also
aimed to provide a friendly service, albeit with not all of the full-service ‘frills’, Virgin Blue also adopted a commitment
approach, especially with its staff who interact most with its ‘guests’.
This reminds us that airlines (and other enterprises) still have scope for exercising strategic choice with regard to employment relations
policies. However, their scope for choice is constrained by national institutions and regulation, and can be further constrained
when economic circumstances get more difficult, for example, as in 2008.
