REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS
13 October 2014, I published directions with reasons in relation to an
application for review pursuant to section 72M of the
Workers Rehabilitation
and Compensation Act 1986
(“the Act”) of a series of decisions
made by the WorkCover Corporation of South Australia (“the
Corporation”).
The application had been lodged by the Executive Director
of the South Australian Council of Social Service Inc. (“SACOSS”):
SACOSS & Others v. WorkCover
[2014] SAWPRP 5.
that time, the name of the Corporation has changed to the Return to Work
Corporation of South Australia: see
, Schedule 9
of which amended the former
WorkCover Corporation Act 1994
to that effect
(clause 11) and changed the name of the 1994 Act to the
Corporation of South Australia Act 1994
(clause 9 of the same Schedule).
These provisions commenced operation on 2 February 2015: see
(Commencement) Proclamation 2014
, 4 December 2014,
p.6610), clause 2(3)(zc).
Corporation has the option of continuing to act under the old name or adopting
the new name in any proceedings: see
Arrangements) (Administration) Regulations 2015
regulation 4.
Corporation has made it known it prefers henceforth to be known as the Return to
Work Corporation of South Australia for all
purposes, and I amend the title of
these proceedings accordingly.
the same time, and through the same proclamation (clause 2(3)(za) thereof),
section 157 of the 2014 Act has been brought into operation,
providing for
reviews of premium decisions in almost identical terms to section 72M of the
1986 Act. The two provisions, of course,
apply to the review of decisions made
under the respective legislative regimes and are in no way in conflict with one
my remarks of 13 October 2014, I set out to the best of my understanding the
history of the application before me, its significance,
the relevant legislative
and other provisions apparently bearing on the application, and the questions on
which the parties had sought
my ruling. I then made the following
directions:
[33] Pursuant to my delegated powers under the Act, I
direct WorkCover, within 28 days of receipt of this direction, to disclose to
the applicants (through their solicitor) and to the Panel any documents falling
within [25] and [26] above.
[34] I further direct the applicants, within 28 days of receipt of compliance
or purported compliance by WorkCover with that requirement,
lodge with the
registry, and serve on the Crown Solicitor, a statement of the basis on which
the applicants consider the assessments
they have received to be unreasonable,
with as much particularity as possible.
[35] If there are any practical difficulties presented by compliance with
these directions, I will call the matter back on at short
notice on request of
either party. In the absence of any such request, I will re-list the matter for
further directions when I become
aware that the directions above have been
cover of a letter dated 14 November 2014 (a copy of which has been lodged with
the registry), Ms A. Carabelas, Director, Scheme
Legal Insurance of the
Corporation, forwarded to Mr Rossi, the applicants’ solicitor, two very
voluminous and one smaller books
of documents in purported compliance with my
direction to the Corporation.
have been supplied with a copy of an email then sent by Ms Carabelas to Mr Rossi
on 15 December 2014, which was as follows:
I refer to my two letters dated 12 November 2014 and note that I have not
received particulars in accordance with the direction in
paragraph 34 of the
President’s directions published on 13 October 2014 or discovery,
requested in the longer of the two letters,
from your clients.
Would you please be kind enough to indicate, as soon as possible, when your
clients will comply with the President’s direction
and my request for
Tas Carabelas
Director, Scheme Legal
Ms Carabelas emailed the registry (with a copy to Mr Rossi) on 5 February 2015
in the following terms:
I refer to the directions with reasons
published by the President in this matter on 13 October 2014. I advise that
ReturnToWorkSA
(formerly WorkCoverSA) complied with the orders in paragraphs 25
and 26 of the directions by 12 November 2014. We have received no
response from
the applicants solicitors nor have we received any particulars.
As this matter has been pending since December 2012 we consider that the
application for review should be listed for hearing by the
Panel based on the
documents disclosed to date with appropriate directions to ensure ReturnToWorkSA
is not prejudiced by the late
delivery of particulars or documents by the
applicants.
Accordingly we request that this mater be listed for a directions hearing
before the President on a date convenient to the President
and on which both
solicitors and counsel are available.
Tas Carabelas
Director, Scheme Legal
situation indicated by Ms Carabelas’ correspondence is
unsatisfactory.
is no question that the applicant organisations have a right under section 72M
to seek reviews if they consider the assessments
they have received are
unreasonable. However, if they cannot indicate the basis for their belief, it is
difficult for the Corporation
to prepare for a hearing or for the Panel to
conduct it.
the Corporation has been agitating, since the beginning of these proceedings, a
view that the likely grounds for the application
may be outside the ambit of
section 72M — failing which, outside the terms of the delegation of powers
under that section to
this Panel — because (I gather) the apparent grounds
seek to dispute antecedent decisions that are not intended to be reviewable
under section 72M (or under the terms of the delegation to the Panel).
I have observed previously, a finding that the application falls outside the
terms of delegation to the Panel would not be fatal
to the application. It would
simply mean that the application had to be dealt with by the Board — which
all agree is not well
set up to sit as a quasi-judicial body. The Board might,
in response, decide to issue of one-off delegation, either to the Panel
some other body or person.
a finding that the application falls entirely outside section 72M would,
obviously, be fatal to it.
is to be noted that the Panel, since its earliest days, has maintained that
without an explicit statutory definition of what is
“unreasonable”
within the meaning of section 72M, the test must be taken to relate to a form of
unreasonableness capable
of being cured under the available powers as set out in
section 72M(4): e.g.,
Skilled Engineering v. WorkCover (No.2)
[2001] SAWLRP 11
Benchmark Healthcare v. WorkCover (No.2)
An inability to cure the complaint within the available powers is
surely an indication that an application does not fall within section
it may not be the only indication.
I indicated in my remarks of 13 October 2014, this Panel endeavours to provide a
user-friendly forum that avoids excessive legalism
and extended interlocutory
processes. Sometimes, however, there is no choice.
my respectful opinion, this issue must be brought to a head. Clause 4 of Part 2
WorkCover Premium Review Panel Determination 2012
Australian Government Gazette
, 10 May 2012, p.1617) authorises the President
of the Panel to sit alone to give directions, determine procedural matters,
conciliation, seek evidence or dispose of an application on a matter of
law falling within the delegated functions of the Panel involving
no disputes of
fact and no exercise of discretion. I propose to list the application in the
very near future to hear the parties
on the position that the Corporation has in
effect been putting for a long time, that the application falls outside section
should be struck out on that basis — or, if it falls within
section 72M but outside the terms of the Panel’s delegation,
it should be
referred to the Board for further consideration.
propose to list that hearing on
Thursday 19 March 2015
. Nothing will be listed after it on the day, so the
balance of the afternoon will be available. If that date and time present any
difficulty for the availability of counsel, the parties should contact the
within 14 days
of receipt of these remarks and an
alternative date and time, not very long afterwards, will be arranged.
either party desires to lodge any further documentation for consideration in
connection with the hearing, this should be done by
close of business,
Friday 6 March 2015
to permit the other party to digest it. If, despite
this direction, either party seeks to introduce new material at the hearing,
situation may be produced entitling the other party to an adjournment to
consider and respond to that material.
parties will assist me, and themselves, if they lodge brief written outlines
(and serve them on each other) before
close of business, Monday 16 March
. Again, if either party seeks to tender a written outline on the
day, I will gratefully accept it, but if the other party claims
to have been
taken by surprise by the introduction of any novel argument, a situation may be
produced entitling the other party to
further time to respond.
I adjourn further consideration of this application for hearing on the limited
area I have indicated above on
Thursday 19 March 2015
, subject to the other directions I have
