applicant, Affinity Capital Pty Ltd, must within 14 days of this order pay
$2,000.00 to the Body Corporate for Mount Whitsunday,
pursuant to
section 270(3)
Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997
REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] Affinity
Capital Pty Ltd (
) is the owner of lot 11 in the community
titles scheme Mount Whitsunday CTS 37885. It seeks orders against the Body
Corporate for
Mount Whitsunday (
) in a dispute about an
extraordinary general meeting, held 8 August 2025 (
[2] Among other
things, owners decided to remove the company’s director, Carolyn Lewis,
from the body corporate’s committee,
for which she was the chairperson and
secretary. The applicant is represented in the application by Ms Lewis.
September 2025, I dismissed the application for an interim order to appoint an
administrator in place of the current
[4] Now for
consideration is the application for final orders, expressed as
1. Meeting declared void
An order declaring that the Extraordinary General Meeting purportedly held on
8 August 2025 is void and of no effect.
2. Resolutions declared void
An order declaring that all resolutions purportedly passed at that meeting
are void and of no effect.
3. Fresh election meeting
A consequential order that the Body Corporate must, within 28 days of the
date of this order (allowing for statutory notice), convene
a new Extraordinary
General Meeting for the sole purpose of electing a committee.
Preliminaries
Whitsunday CTS 37885 is a scheme comprising 33 lots and common property. It is
governed by the
Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997

satisfied that the application is within an adjudicator’s jurisdiction and
that the applicant has standing to bring
the application for this particular
[7] I note that
the applicant did not respond to the Commissioner’s invitation to receive
copies of the submissions on the application
and to make a submission in
application, as originally lodged, sought 7 orders. Following my decision on the
interim order application, Ms Lewis informed
this Office that it wished to
proceed with the application for only the first 3 final orders, being those
referred to above.
[9] As to the
relevant facts and timeline for final order 1, the applicant says (quoting
convened: The EGM was convened for 8 August 2025
30 July 2025
– Access request ignored: In her capacity as Secretary and Chairperson,
the applicant formally requested secretarial
access to VoteMax and copies of
proxy/voting records to discharge statutory duties and ensure transparency. No
access was provided.
6 August 2025
– Urgent notice ignored: The applicant wrote again, placing Archers and
the committee on formal notice that the
manager had been uncontactable, that
owners had not received voting materials, and that meeting validity would be
challenged if defects
were not rectified.
7 August 2025
– Misleading broadcast uncorrected: The applicant objected to a misleading
all-owners email capable of unfairly
influencing voting. No corrective circular
8 August 2025
(~9:00am) – No practical opportunity to verify: At Archers’ office
the applicant was handed voting/proxy
materials only moments before the meeting,
leaving no practical time to check eligibility or proxy validity (Annexure D).
While there,
she observed a pre-meeting Microsoft Teams call between Archers and
six committee members, from which she was excluded.
[10] As to the
consequential contraventions to be remedied by final order 1, and why an order
is warranted, the applicant says (again,
quoting verbatim):
procedural fairness: Excluding the duly elected Secretary/Chairperson from the
pre-meeting briefing and withholding timely
access to essential records
undermined a fair process.
Disenfranchisement
risk: Owners reporting non-receipt of voting materials (raised on 6 Aug) shows
the vote was conducted without ensuring
all eligible owners could
participate.
Integrity of
vote not verifiable: Refusal to provide records in time prevented the Secretary
from verifying voter eligibility and
proxy validity before the meeting
A meeting run in
these circumstances cannot reflect the owners’ democratic will. The
process was tainted by partiality, obstruction
and disenfranchisement. The only
fair remedy is to declare the EGM void so the scheme is not governed by a
procedurally defective
application for an order to invalidate the EGM, as the applicant submits,
essentially turns on whether the alleged events
and circumstances affected the
outcomes of the votes.
[12] Motion 1
merely confirmed the minutes of the last general meeting. Motion 2 resulted in
Ms Lewis being removed as chairperson
and secretary of the committee, by a
vote of 17 to 10. Motions 3, 4 and 5, to appoint her replacements and a new
ordinary member,
passed by the same margin. Motions to remove other sitting
members were defeated by 11 votes to 16, and motions to elect their replacements
were ruled out of order as being in conflict with those outcomes. Motion 16 to
change the body corporate manager was defeated.
applicant asserts that voters were ‘disenfranchised’, but that is
not borne out by the evidence. There were 27
votes from 33 lots, which is an
unusually high voter turnout, and it is in my view strongly indicative that
owners were able to and
invited submissions on the interim order application for the appointment of an
administrator, and that received some support
from other owners. However, there
are no submissions in support of the requested final orders to invalidate the
EGM and re-run a
committee election. If in fact owners had been materially
misled or disenfranchised or otherwise not able to properly engage with
then I would expect to receive submissions to that effect, but there are
[15] In the
circumstances, I see no good reason to invalidate the EGM.
orders 2 and 3, the applicant says they follow from the need for the EGM to be
declared void. It follows from my decision
above that I see no basis to make
requested orders 2 or 3.
application was clearly driven by Ms Lewis’s disenchantment with being
removed from the committee. Plainly, she is
unpopular with the majority of
owners. As I had already noted in my reasons on the interim order application,
there is no indication
that the EGM results are not a true indication of the
owners’ collective will. Even if I had ordered the election to be re-run,
there is seemingly no prospect of her being re-elected or the other positions
being changed.
application in my view may fairly be described as either vexatious or at least
misconceived, depending on how generously
one may be disposed towards Ms Lewis.
In either case, in dismissing the application I may award costs against the
applicant, to a
maximum of $2,000, to compensate other parties for their costs
associated with responding to the
application.
The body corporate has
made such a request, giving an itemised invoice from its lawyers as evidence of
its costs totalling $8,340.75.
I will award it the maximum of
