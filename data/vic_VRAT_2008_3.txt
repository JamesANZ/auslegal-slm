(His Honour Judge Nixon)
D E C I S I O N
HIS HONOUR: In deference to Mr French, who is representing himself, I
will go into more detail than I would ordinarily do in an appeal
against the
penalty and it is an appeal by Mr French against the severity of the penalty,
which was six months disqualification imposed
by the Harness Racing Stewards on
20 March 2008 for an elevated TCO2 reading in a pre-race sample taken from his
horse Regal Operative
New Zealand before the horse competed in Race 2 at the
Bendigo meeting held on 29 February 2008. In his notice of appeal Mr French
also queried the way the Stewards came to this decision.
Well, the appeal is by way of a re-hearing. The evidence in the
transcript which I read closely, establishes that the pre-race
sample, when
analysed by Racing Analytical Services, indicated a level of 37.5 millimoles per
litre which was subject to the ordinary
uncertainty measurement. The referee
sample was analysed in New South Wales and that analysis indicated a level of
37.7 millimoles
per litre, which, again, is subject to the uncertainty in
measurement of plus or minus 1 millimole a litre.
On 6 March 2008 a stable blood sample was taken from the horse and on
analysis the TCO2 level was 31.7 millimoles per litre. Before
the drug sample
was taken, on 29 February, it seems that some six samples had previously been
taken from this particular horse and
another sample was taken on 14 March, so
there were eight samples overall. It appears that the TCO2 level from the six
samples before the race had gradually increased to a level of 35.5,
which was just below the permissible level of 36 millimoles per
Mr French received a letter on Thursday, 28 February, which informed
him that he was on the border of the permissible limit and
it is common ground,
as it appears from the transcript, that he attempted to speak to Mr Rogers who
was the author of the letter,
by telephone on 28 February; he could not contact
Mr Rogers was out of the office on official duties, and he
did not return the call. Mr Rogers that is, did not return the call until
the following Monday.
In the meantime, Regal Operative NZ had raced at Bendigo on Friday, 29
February. The stable blood sample was analysed at 31.7 millimoles
per litre and
Mr French at the inquiry said, and I noted, when they took it, that he had
nothing done to him at all. "The only thing
I cut out was the powder." And Mr
French was referring to, it would appear, to have been two preparations. There
was the green
powder or green drench, and a Troy product, apparently consisting
of vitamins and calcium gluconate.
Dr Cust, the veterinarian for Harness Racing Victoria, expressed his
opinion that neither of those two preparations would have any
marked effect on
the TCO2 level of any horse. It appears from what I read in the transcript that
Mr French had contacted the manufacturer
of the green drench and the
representative to whom he spoke informed him that there was nothing in the
product which should raise
the TCO2 level, but he appeared to sound a cautious
note in that Mr French had added the Troy product to the green drench
preparation.
The only explanation that Mr French could give for the horse's elevated
TCO2 level was, and I quote from what he said, "His levels
have gone up since
I've been doing them two things, and that's basically it." There was no problem
with the pre-mix feed and Mr
French denied any administration of any
alkalinising agent. The blood sample taken on 14 March was analysed at, I
think, 27 or 28
millimoles per litre.
The horse, Regal Operative, had not received the green drench or the
Troy product after Mr French became aware that his horse had
positive. He claimed that Regal Operative had received the green drench about
five days before the horse raced at Bendigo
on 29 February, and Dr Cust's
evidence was that a TCO2 level will rise to a maximum in perhaps four to six
hours after administration,
possibly eight hours he said. Within 24 hours the
level would have reverted back to its stable, non-race day level. In effect,
Cust believed that it would appear there would have had to have been an
administration of alkalinising agents within ten hours
before the race.
Now the Stewards, Mr French, to establish a breach of the rules, do not
have to prove what caused the elevated TCO2 level. The
obligation is on you, as
the trainer, to present the horse free of prohibited substances. It is, of
course, permissible to run a
horse whose TCO2 level is just on 36 or below 36
millimoles per litre and here it is quite clear, and the appeal is only against
the penalty, that you presented the horse to run in Race 2 at Bendigo when it
was not free of prohibited substances.
With regard to penalty, the Stewards appropriately took into account
the fact that you pleaded guilty to the charge and they reduced
the penalty,
they said, by three months by way of a discount for your plea of guilty. Now
you would realise, hopefully, that cases
involving an elevated TCO2 level are
all too frequent in harness racing, and trainers still seem slow to learn that
their obligation
is to present their horse for a race free of prohibited
substances.
In cases such as this, general deterrence is an importance
consideration, so far as penalty is concerned, and the penalty has to
to send a message to all trainers that if they do present a horse in a race with
an elevated TCO2 level, then the penalty
is likely to be stern. You have asked
for a suspension rather than a disqualification for the reasons that you have
advanced. Mr
Burns, for the Stewards, has demonstrated by presenting the list
of penalties that the last suspension for this type of offence,
was imposed in
1993. That is 15 years ago.
You have not got a clean sheet. You were suspended for three months in
2003, for permitting a person who was disqualified to be
on your stable area,
shoeing a horse. In about 1996, and I see it was the former Chairman, Judge
McNab, who heard the appeal, fined
you $2000 for not informing the Stewards that
you were no longer the trainer of a horse which returned a very high TCO2 level,
in the order of 40 millimoles per litre. You are a small trainer
who, according to the transcript, had two horses in training.
They were both
owned by you at the time the inquiry was held in March of this year. Every
case has to be heard and determined
and dealt with on its own facts and merits.
Now, I have considered the level of the reading here and the level of your
culpability.
There was a suggestion that perhaps somebody could have thrown
something into the feed for the horses, but there was no evidence
that suggestion.
The green drench was administered five days before the race in
question. Dr Cust ruled that out, in those circumstances, as a likely
and he suspected an administration of an alkalinising agent within about ten
hours of the race. You could not come up with
any explanation for the elevated
TCO2 level, apart from the combination of the green drench and the Troy mixture.
I agree that the level of your cooperation with harness racing
authorities was high. Nonetheless, as another judge on this Tribunal,
Williams, recently observed, for quite some years now, TCO2 offending has been
perceived as a particular threat to the integrity
and reputation for honesty in
the harness racing industry, and it is obvious and it is right to say that
public confidence is of
the utmost importance to the industry.
I have considered the penalty. I believe a penalty of disqualification
is appropriate for this type of offence. As to the level
of six months
disqualification, I have discussed it with my advisers who are well versed in
the harness racing industry, both of
them, but ultimately the decision is mine
and mine alone, and I do not propose to vary the penalty imposed at the inquiry.
it is an appropriate penalty in all the circumstances, and the appeal
will be dismissed.
MR BURNS: As the Tribunal pleases.
HIS HONOUR: I will return the log and the report. You can keep it if
you like that. I'll return the deposit too thank you to Mr
French. Does that
cover the matter, Mr Burns?
MR BURNS: It does thank you, Your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you.
