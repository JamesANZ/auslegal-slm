LEGISLATION CITED:
Anti-discrimination Act
section 191(1)
REPRESENTATION:
JB on behalf of the complainant.
Ms Kelly Cooper of Crown Law for the respondent.
complainant alleges he has been discriminated against contrary to the provisions
Anti-discrimination Act
(Qld) on the basis of impairment in
the provision of state laws and programmes. Without descending into the
particularity of the
alleged disability or its consequences, it suffices to say
that the impairment affects the capacity of the complainant to participate
secondary education provided by the state without assistance in the form of
additional teaching support, more time to complete
tasks than is given to other
students and different writing and reading material etc.
Respondent, Department of Education, contends it has identified the
complainant’s relevant needs and has responded appropriately
needs throughout his education.
proceedings were instituted in 2007. Pursuant to management protocols both in
the Anti-Discrimination Commission and in the Tribunal,
the matter should have
been afforded a hearing if not resolved some time ago. That is of particularly
concern in circumstance where
the complainant will by 2010 have completed his
entire secondary education.
have been many attempts to resolve this dispute by conciliation or mediation.
All have failed. The most recent conciliation
was adjourned to enable the
parties to exchange offers of settlement. There is now a request that I as the
conciliator further adjourn
the conciliation. I am not prepared to do that.
The relative position of both sides has been explored on many occasions. There
is no proper purpose served merely by allowing the dispute to continue
unresolved. The conciliation process as conducted by me is
now at an end.
the course of the two directions hearing conducted before me with a view to
having the matter resolved it became apparent that
the complainant as
represented by his mother faces the difficulty of being represented by a person
without legal skills. I do not
mean that as a mark of disrespect for the
complainant’s mother, who throughout this process has obviously only
sought to achieve
for the complainant that which she thought best and in his
matter is complex. It is by no means a case assured of success. If it does not
succeed, an order for cost might be made against
the complainant or the
complainant’s agent, a very significant detriment to the complainant and
his family who are not apparently
of substantial wealth. My assessment of the
complainant’s agent’s in the directions hearings held before me
regrettably
leads me to the conclusion that it is not in the best interests of
the complainant for him to continue to be represented by his mother
Apart from the lack of other legal skills which might benefit the
complainant’s case – the complainant’s
present agent has
failed to articulate for me or for the Respondent, the precise orders including
orders for compensation or costs
which she might seek at a final hearing. My
assessment is that she will be unable to adequately prepare or present evidence
she might need to make out the complaint. It also seems evident now that
both she and the complainant have ongoing health problems
which compound this
difficulty.
of the Act, if the Tribunal is of the reasonable opinion that the
preservation of anonymity of a person who has been involved in
a proceeding
under the Act is necessary to protect the work, security, privacy or any human
right of the person, the Tribunal may
make an order prohibiting the disclosure
of the person’s identity. The complainant is 17 years of age. I am of
the opinion
that the preservation of anonymity of the complainant is necessary
to protect the complainant’s privacy and welfare. The
complainant’s mother as his agent is also a person who has been involved
in a proceeding under the Act within
, and I consider that an order for
anonymity of the complainant’s mother is necessary to ensure the privacy
and welfare of the
complainant.
my view the matter should be set down for a final hearing with expedition. This
will not be able to be done prior to the commencement
of QCAT. I therefore
propose to direct the Registrar to obtain an early listing of the matter for
directions to determine how the
complainant is to be represented in a hearing.
I therefore order that:
conciliation conference before me be determined;
(b) the matter
be listed for directions on or as soon as possible after 17 December 2009
before QCAT;
complainant’s agent should be in a position to satisfy the Tribunal in
accordance with the present Amended Practice
Direction 9 that she or some other
person can properly represent the complainant at a final hearing.
(d) That the
disclosure of the identity of the complainant and the complainant’s agent
is prohibited.
