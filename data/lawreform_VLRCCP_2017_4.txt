‘The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others
only a green thing that stands in the way.’—
William Blake
The Letters
Neighbour proximity brings with it commendable values and benefits:
existence of community; mutual help and assistance; sharing of
resources; and
safety by the defeat of isolation. Trees bring with them commendable values and
benefits also: cooling and shading;
biodiversity; birdlife; cover and privacy;
and aesthetics. The quantifiable, shared, health and amenity benefits of living
environments mean that trees and the ‘urban forest’ are
valued and protected.
And yet neighbour proximity and trees are not always a happy meld. In an
increasingly urbanised environment, people’s decisions
and the trees on it can have significant effects on their neighbours’
are the third largest category of
dispute that comes before the Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria.
Many people are involved in disputes about trees each year, including
disputes about encroaching roots and branches and about trees
which cause damage
or harm. The methods for resolving such disputes— ranging from informal
negotiation to litigation—can
be unclear and unnecessarily confusing. A
number of Australian states have recently enacted specific legislation to
provide processes
for resolution, and to identify more clearly parties’
rights and responsibilities.
The Victorian Law Reform Commission is examining the current operation of
the relevant laws and processes in Victoria governing neighbourhood
disputes. The inquiry forms part of the Commission’s community law reform
program, which enables members of the community
to contribute their ideas on how
to improve Victorian law, and which is a valuable and important part of the
Commission’s functions.
In order to contain the size of the inquiry as
required by the
Victorian Law Reform Commission Act 2000
, the inquiry does not consider disputes about light or views, important
though they are to those affected, nor does it consider disputes
trees situated on public land. The Commission’s priority is upon effective
and efficient resolution of disputes
between neighbours about trees on
neighbouring private land that cause interference, damage or harm.
The Commission has undertaken this inquiry following suggestions from
community members, a number of which were based on their own
experience of
trying to resolve a neighbourhood tree dispute.
The Commission will now consider whether the current law and processes, as
well as available information and support, are effective
and, if not, what type
of legal regime should take their place.
I encourage anyone with an interest in the issues discussed in this paper to
make a submission to the Commission by 28 February 2018.
Your submissions will
be taken into account in the formulation of recommendations by the Commission to
government as to reform of

In conducting this review, the Commission will have particular regard to:
• recent legal developments in Australian and international
Queensland; and
• any alternative schemes for resolving neighbourhood tree disputes.
The Commission will not consider:
• disputes concerning trees situated on public land

Structure of this paper
This consultation paper is divided into seven chapters. Each chapter deals
with a distinct aspect of law and policy, and some pose
questions to inform the
Commission’s research recommendations in that area.
Chapter 1 introduces the paper, and provides background to the project and
the issues raised. It explains the scope of the project,
and includes
information on how to participate in the inquiry.
Chapter 2 outlines the many different types of tree dispute that may occur,
and sets out examples of each in case studies.
Chapter 3 sets out the law governing tree disputes in Victoria, and explains
the processes typically undertaken to resolve disputes.
It also notes where
Victorian legislation may affect action taken in tree disputes.
Chapter 4 examines the regulation of vegetation in Victoria, and sets out the
structure of Victorian planning law and relevant local
controls, including
overlays. It also provides examples of tree protection and management from local
government areas, where they
have the potential to affect the management of
private trees.
Chapter 5 canvasses approaches to resolving tree disputes in other
Wales, Queensland
and Tasmania, and highlights some notable approaches in international
Chapter 6 examines both the criticisms and the benefits of the current system
in Victoria, and provides options for reform for public
comment and input. The
majority of questions about change to the current Victorian system are in this
Chapter 7 briefly concludes the paper.

8 Community input
1. Defining neighbourhood tree disputes
1.1 Many people have strong and valuable relationships with their neighbours.
Living near neighbours can be beneficial, and can allow
for sharing of
resources, keeping an eye out for one another’s safety and wellbeing, and
creating a sense of community. However,
people living near each other can be
affected by each other’s decisions and property.
1.2 Trees on private land are usually privately owned, but the benefits of
living in a treed environment are shared. Neighbours may
enjoy the increased
shade, cooling properties, biodiversity and aesthetic value of a
neighbour’s tree.1 Particular trees may
be valued for the privacy they
provide, or for their noise-reducing qualities. Properties in leafy suburbs have
stronger property
values than those without trees.
1.3 Sometimes, however, trees on private land and the way they are (or
are not) maintained can cause disturbance to neighbours’
use and enjoyment
of their own land. Neighbours need not directly interact with one another to
have an impact on each other’s
1.4 Common issues that may lead to disputes between neighbours about trees
• branches hanging over boundary lines
• roots causing damage to foundations, drainage and sewer pipelines
• the spread of weeds and creeping plants
• leaf litter causing damage or creating hazards (eg slippery pathways
or clogged gutters)
• unsafe trees and branches creating hazards (eg poisonous fruit or
leaves, or insecure branches)
• trees impeding a view and/or blocking sunlight, and/or affecting the
neighbour’s ability to use solar panels.2
1.5 These disputes can be generally characterised as a competition of rights,
namely the tree owner’s right to use and enjoy
the land in any lawful
manner they see fit, and the affected neighbour’s right to enjoy their
land without unreasonable interference.
1.6 Tree disputes, whether based on minor impositions, such as trees dropping
leaf litter or branches beginning to grow over a property
border, or more
significant ones, such as damage to property or harm to people, can inspire
passionate and uncompromising reactions.
1 The quantifiable economic benefit of trees is also increasingly well
recognised. See, eg, the discussion in Greg M Moore, ‘The
Importance and
Value of Urban Forests as Climate Changes’ (2012) 129 (5)

1.7 The fact that tree disputes may affect people’s property rights,
their home life and their interactions with neighbours
exacerbates their
1.8 Where a tree owner refuses to remedy the issue, neighbourhood tree
disputes can escalate quickly, and can undermine a good neighbourly
relationship.
1.9 Personal security and safety within a private home-space are important,
and an ongoing dispute with a neighbour can threaten individuals’
enjoyment of this space.
1.10 The probability of this type of dispute escalating may be higher because
of neighbours’
close proximity to one another, resulting in more encounters in their
day-to-day lives.
1.11 Tree disputes can also escalate into further disputes, such as vandalism
or other matters.3
1.12 The need for clear rules and simple processes to resolve neighbourhood
tree disputes has been recognised since the beginning
of written law.
1.13 Early documentary evidence of this can be traced back to around 455 BC
and the Laws of the Twelve Tables, often cited as the
beginning of European law.
Representing the written code of the Roman Republic, the laws were drawn up by a
commission of ten (
), and recorded on twelve bronze tablets.4
Designed to apply across the entire society, regardless of class, the laws
included these
rules about trees’ impact on neighbours justifying legal
action and attracting penalties:5
If a tree from a neighbour’s farm has been felled by the wind over
one’s farm, ... one rightfully can take legal action
for that tree to be
If an overhanging tree causes injury by its branches or its shade, let it be
15 feet from the ground.7
For each illegal cutdown of trees that belong to someone else the culprit
1.14 In Victoria, people usually begin by trying to resolve their disputes
with neighbours informally. However, this is often not
practicable or effective,
particularly where
neighbours disagree over who is responsible for taking action to mitigate
risks or damage.
1.15 Neighbours involved in tree disputes may not have a clear sense of their
rights and responsibilities, making informal dispute
resolution difficult. The
Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria (DSCV), a unit of the Department of
Justice and Regulation, deals
with a large number of tree-related disputes. Its
mediation services are often the first external assistance sought.9
1.16 If mediation is unsuccessful, parties involved in tree disputes may
choose to take their dispute to court.10 These disputes are
currently governed
by the common law, specifically the torts of nuisance and negligence. Common law
rules in this area are often
complex, difficult to define, and lack clear
statements of rights and responsibilities.

1.18 The options currently available for resolving disputes are either
non-compulsory and non- binding (informal resolution, DSCV
mediation and private
mediation) or litigious and not very accessible (court-based legal action).
1.19 The Commission has been told by community members that the current
mechanism for addressing tree disputes in Victoria is confusing,
ineffective and
1.20 Proposals and comments received in favour of reviewing the law call for
the implementation of a statutory scheme that clearly
sets out the rights and
responsibilities of parties involved in tree disputes.12
Defining a tree
1.21 Disputes between neighbours can arise over a wide variety of vegetation,
including trees of different sizes, bushes, creepers
and vines, overhanging
branches, roots, products of trees (needles, leaf litter and pollen) and dead
1.22 Although most people have a common understanding of what a tree is,
there are very few definitions of ‘tree’ in Victorian
legislation.13
Existing definitions include:
Forests Act 1958
(Vic) provides that a ‘tree or
trees includes trees shrubs bushes seedlings saplings and reshoots whether alive
or dead’.14
Country Fire Authority Act 1958
(Vic) defines ‘scrub
or vegetation’ to include
‘trees bushes plants and undergrowth of all kinds and sizes whether
living or dead and whether standing or not standing, and
also includes any part
of any such trees bushes plants or undergrowth whether severed or not
severed’.15
1.23 At the local government level, trees are defined in different ways. For
example, the Melbourne City Council’s definition
includes ‘the
trunk, branches, canopy and root system of [a] tree’.16 Nillumbik Shire
Council defines a tree as a ‘long
lived woody perennial plant greater than
(or usually greater than) 3 metres in height with one or relatively few main
stems or trunks’.17
Macquarie Dictionary
defines a tree as ‘a perennial
plant having a permanent woody, self-supporting main stem or trunk, usually
growing to a considerable
height, and usually developing branches at some
distance from the ground’.18 Further definitions are set out at [6.17]
1.25 For the purposes of this review, the Commission is seeking community
views about disputes over trees and vegetation broadly.
Other jurisdictions
provide different definitions of what constitutes a tree, and the options for
this in Victoria are discussed
in Chapter 6.

Scope of the issue
1.26 Many residential properties have trees growing within their boundaries.
The potential
for neighbourhood tree disputes to arise is high. Data from the DSCV shows
that a large number of people experience disputes with
neighbours over
1.27 In preliminary consultations, senior staff at DSCV told the Commission
that tree disputes were the third most common type of
dispute referred to their
1.28 Data supplied by the DSCV shows that in the 5.5-year period spanning
December 2011 to
May 2017, 18,727 of the 109,039 disputes referred related to tree disputes.
This represents an average of 17.2 per cent of the total
workload. The highest
percentage of tree disputes (19.2 per cent) occurred in 2012, with 2014
recording the lowest figure
(15.7 per cent). It is clear that disputes about trees are a consistently
significant proportion of the DSCV’s work.19
1.29 Given the volume and frequency of neighbourhood tree disputes, the
Commission has determined that a review of the current
law governing the
resolution of these disputes is timely.
Origin of the project
1.30 As well as inquiring into matters referred to it by the
Attorney-General, the Commission has the power to initiate its own projects
under its community law reform function.
1.31 This function involves inquiring into ‘relatively minor legal
issues that are of general community concern’.20 The
‘relatively minor’ means limited in size and scope. It does not mean
that the subject matter of the project is insignificant.
These projects are
referred to as ‘community law reform projects’, and are often
initially suggested to the Commission
by community members or groups.
1.32 The terms of
section 5(1)(b)
Victorian Law Reform Commission
(Vic) mandate that community law reform projects ‘will not
require a significant deployment of the resources available to the
Commission’. Accordingly, the Commission considered the priorities of
subject matter, and concluded that the subject matter
disputes between neighbours about trees on private neighbouring land that
cause damage and/or harm (‘neighbourhood tree disputes’).
1.33 To limit the size of the inquiry, the Commission decided not to
investigate disputes concerning trees situated on public land,
nor disputes
concerning the obstruction of sunlight and views by neighbouring trees. The full
terms of reference are set out at vii
of this consultation paper.
Interstate reviews
1.34 Disputes between neighbours have been the subject of reviews by
government agencies and state law reform bodies.
1.35 While the scope and subject matter of each review have been different,
each has been of substantial assistance to the Commission
in its preliminary
investigation.
1.36 The law reform bodies of Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania have
completed significant reviews. The New South Wales review
dealt more generally
with issues relating to neighbour relations, of which tree disputes was one. The
Queensland review explored
issues common to tree and fence disputes.

1.37 The Tasmanian review focused on rights to sunlight and views. While this
the Commission will be
dealing with similar themes.
1.38 Each of these reviews recommended a statutory scheme for resolving tree
disputes and made recommendations about which forums
would be most appropriate
to bring an action under the proposed legislation. They all recommended that
neighbours be required to
attempt to resolve disputes themselves before pursuing
legal remedies.
New South Wales Law Reform Commission—
Neighbour and
Relations Report
1.39 The New South Wales Law Reform Commission (NSWLRC) review preceded the
introduction of the statutory scheme for resolving tree
disputes in New South
Wales. The review considered disputes over damage and harm caused by trees, and
the obstruction of sunlight
1.40 The NSWLRC found that the common law of nuisance and abatement did not
provide an adequate dispute resolution process. The NSWLRC
recommendations, including that remedies be made available for such damage or
harm and obstructions of sunlight and views
and that, before seeking relief,
neighbours be required to attempt to resolve disputes themselves.21
1.41 The report recommended that tree owners should have greater
responsibility for any damage trees may cause. It proposed new legislation
would make tree owners responsible for ensuring that their trees do not cause
damage to neighbouring property or interfere
unreasonably with a
neighbour’s enjoyment of land.22
1.42 As a result of the NSWLRC recommendation for a simple, inexpensive and
accessible process for resolving tree disputes, the separate
statutory scheme

Sunlight and Views
1.47 The Tasmania Law Reform Institute (TLRI) review was limited to tree
disputes about the obstruction of sunlight and views. The
Institute made 18
recommendations, including that remedies be made available for such obstructions
and that, before seeking relief,
neighbours be required to attempt to resolve
disputes themselves.
1.48 Notably, the TLRI stated that ‘a model similar to the Victorian
model of dispute
resolution for resolving neighbourhood disputes about trees and hedges
[should] not be implemented in Tasmania’.27
1.49 The recommendations have formed the basis of the
Neighbourhood
Disputes About Plants Act 2017
(Tas). Although the TLRI review dealt only
with sunlight and views, in drafting the legislation ‘it was considered
for the statutory scheme to also address matters that would otherwise
be dealt with under a common law nuisance’.28 The new
Act therefore also covers trees causing damage or injury.
Relevant Victorian review
1.50 As a number of jurisdictions have enacted similar (or combined) schemes
for the regulation of neighbourhood and tree disputes,
the 2014 reforms to the
Fences Act 1968
(Vic) have some relevance to this project.
Review of the
Fences Act 1968
was subject to a major review by the Victorian
Parliamentary Law Reform
Committee in 1998.
1.52 The Committee’s report made recommendations to make fencing
processes more comprehensive and transparent, and to give parties
guidance about their obligations. Informed by the Committee’s work, the
government undertook a further review of the
in 2011 and conducted
public consultation on a discussion paper in late 2012.
1.53 Changes brought in by the resultant
Fences Amendment Act 2014
clarified and simplified the dispute resolution process in relation to
shared fences.
1.54 Prior to the changes, the
contained separate processes to
manage construction of a dividing fence and the maintenance and repair of a
current fence. The amended
Act provides for one simplified process.
1.55 The amended Act also clarifies issues of long-term tenants’
liability, the contributions of owners and, importantly, introduces
a simple and
clear Notice to Fence, which forms the basis for owners to negotiate over
proposed fencing works.
1.56 In the Second Reading Speech for the Bill, the then-Assistant Treasurer
explained the extent of the problem, and the importance
of the changes to this
seemingly small area of law:
Although the monetary amounts in dispute may be relatively small, fencing
disagreements can create tension between neighbours. In
2012–13, fencing
disputes represented the greatest number of calls to the Dispute Settlement
Centre of Victoria, with 6611
inquiries made. The amount in dispute in a fencing
matter is also likely to be significantly less than the cost of consulting legal
representatives, pursuing court

19 Conclusion
2. Examples of tree disputes
Introduction
2.1 Tree disputes vary in character and complexity because of
ecological and interpersonal factors. For a tree owner, a tree
might provide
shade, privacy, support for wildlife and amenity to their property. However, for
a neighbour, the same tree may become
cause for concern if it is likely to damage their property or cause harm to
its occupants.1
The opposite is also true: a neighbour may enjoy the shade or amenity
provided by a neighbouring tree which drops litter and branches
owner’s garden.2
2.2 Trees are not intrusive or hazardous in and of themselves. However, as a
tree grows, it can interact with neighbouring land.
A common issue occurs when a
tree ‘encroaches’ over boundary lines: parts of the tree, such as
branches or roots, overhang
or grow into neighbouring land. Trees growing close
to boundary lines are more likely to encroach in this way.
2.3 Minor encroachment can be remedied by cutting away the branch or root, or
erecting a root barrier.3 More significant or pervasive
encroachments,
potentially posing greater risks to property or people, may require the
specialist skills of arborists to mitigate
risks and to maintain the structural
integrity of the tree.4
2.4 Although encroachment is an aspect of many tree disputes, it is not
always a factor.
Damage or harm can result without encroachment, such as when leaf litter or
pollen is blown onto neighbouring property, or when an
entire tree falls across
boundary lines onto neighbouring land.
2.5 This chapter uses case studies to explore common ways trees may damage or
interfere with neighbouring property or cause harm,5
and the variety of ways
tree disputes can escalate and adversely affect neighbours’
relationships.
2.6 Some of the cases mentioned in this chapter include trees on public land
that are owned by local councils. Although disputes involving
publicly owned
trees are outside the scope of this inquiry, these cases provide useful
examples of damage or harm which may also
occur between neighbouring private
landowners.

Impact on neighbours’ relationships
2.7 As noted in Chapter 1, tree disputes can compound existing conflict, or
even ruin once amicable relationships.6 While this can
be true of many types of
legal dispute, tree disputes can give rise to particularly impassioned responses
because they can seem
to challenge a person’s ownership and enjoyment of their land and any
sentimental attachment they may have to their tree.
2.8 Tree disputes can create stress and anxiety for neighbours and can
significantly impair their experience of living in their homes.7
According to
Victoria Legal Aid, these types of disputes ‘can have a serious effect on
everyday life.’8 The breakdown
of a harmonious relationship due to a lack
of cooperation, unresponsiveness or hostility and, in extreme cases, trespass
and criminal
damage, may delay or prevent the resolution of a tree dispute.9
Tree disputes can also lead to applications for a personal safety
2.9 Some examples of tree disputes causing a breakdown of neighbourly
relations or compounding pre-existing conflict are given below.11
Owners Corporation SP020030 v Keyt,
12 the owners of a property
next to a block of units managed by an Owners Corporation (OC) planted two
Leyland cypresses along their
dividing fence
which abutted the driveway
of the block of units. Over time, the concrete of this driveway started to lift
and become uneven. This
structural damage was attributed to root damage from the
2.11 The tree owners ignored the OC’s multiple attempts to resolve the
issue and on one occasion became verbally abusive when
approached. The OC then
took legal action for trespass, negligence and nuisance, and applied for damages
of $61,392 for rectification
works. The tree owners decided to sell their
property at auction but the property did not sell. The tree owners still did
2.12 In court the tree owners denied the allegations and knowledge of the
damage. They
later sold their property by private sale to buyers who were not informed
of sale the buyers
were told by the tree owners that they had been informed ‘out of the
blue’ that they were being sued,
and asked the buyers to increase their
purchase price to cover the cost of the damages being sought. The buyers agreed
and, on assurances
from the tree owners that they would rectify the tree problem
before they took possession, eventually settled.
2.13 The tree owners did not rectify the problem by the time the buyers moved
in and all attempts to contact the tree owners were
ignored or lost between the
three different law firms the tree owners had engaged. In court, it was
determined that the damage to
the driveway resulted from the tree owners’
negligence. They were ordered to pay the OC
$61,780 in damages.
2.14 In another case, as reported in the media, a couple were convicted and
criminal damage in the Geelong Magistrates’ Court after they pleaded
guilty to poisoning
40 cypress trees on neighbouring properties. The couple were witnessed
treating the soil near the trees with hydrochloric acid, a
substance known to
kill most plant species.

(24 October 2016).
The couple were believed to have poisoned the trees following longstanding
disputes over the trees which they believed had caused
root damage to their land
and property.13
2.15 Parties to a tree dispute are not always residential neighbours. They
may also be a neighbouring community establishment such
as a school or local
business. Disputes between such establishments and residential neighbours may be
influenced by an uneven balance
of financial and legal resources, and may
therefore require a different approach
to resolution.
Damage and interference to land and property
2.16 Encroachment of branches or tree roots is the most common cause of
tree-related impacts on neighbouring property that are reported
in cases brought
before a court. This likely reflects the seriousness of the damage, which would
justify the expense and time involved
in taking court action.14 Entire trees or
branches may also fall onto neighbouring land.
2.17 Overhanging branches can affect neighbouring properties by taking up
space or dropping leaf litter, and by causing damage to
property by exerting
pressure on or falling onto structures.15
2.18 Encroaching roots may cause damage to structures and foundations, as
well as to other plants, and may pose a safety hazard.16
Leaf litter
2.19 The accumulation of leaf litter on neighbouring land is a common cause
of tree disputes.
Leaf litter can be made up of flowers, fruit, leaves, bark or small pieces of
All trees shed this type of matter. Deciduous trees shed their leaves all at
once, usually in winter, while evergreen trees shed their
leaves all year
2.20 Leaf litter which has dropped onto neighbouring land can cause
blockages in gutters and drains, and affect other parts of
the property. Leaf
litter can also be blown onto neighbouring land by wind and other natural
Wilson v Farah
,18 the affected neighbour brought an
application against her neighbours who owned a fiddlewood tree which overhung
her pool and
deposited flowers and
leaves in it. The leaf litter caused algae to grow in the pool. The affected
neighbour sought the removal of the tree in the New South
Wales Land and
Environment Court (NSWLEC) on the basis that the pool required an unreasonable
level of maintenance, up to three times
a day, in order to be useable. She also
claimed that the leaf litter had damaged her pool and was likely to cause
further damage.
The tree owners disagreed with the removal of the tree but were
prepared to remove the overhanging branches
subject to permission from the local council, which enforced a tree
protection order over the tree.

2.22 The NSWLEC determined that although the tree contributed substantially
to the leaf litter in the pool,19 the maintenance required
formed part of the
ordinary ‘exterior house and grounds maintenance’ expected in urban
environments.20 Furthermore,
it was determined that the leaf litter in the pool
had not caused any damage and was not likely to do so in the future. The
application
was dismissed.21
Leonardi v Watson
,22 the affected neighbours sought the
removal of an Indian raintree on their neighbour’s land in the Queensland
Administrative Tribunal (QCAT). One of the complaints concerned a
large amount of leaf litter, including flowers that
left a sticky residue, on their roof and gutters, causing them to become
blocked and to overflow. They claimed the cost of professional
cleaners caused
them financial hardship. They also pointed to the difficulty of removing small
trees that grew in their garden as
a result of seedlings deposited by the tree.
The Appeal Tribunal decided that the cleaning of the roof and gutters formed
the ordinary level of maintenance required in urban environments, and
that the leaf litter could also be from other trees in the
area.23 The original
application was dismissed.
Encroaching branches
2.24 Branches that overhang boundary lines can cause damage to property by
interfering with a structure.
2.25 Branches may also cause damage by falling into neighbouring property.
The falling of a branch from an otherwise healthy tree
is commonly known as
‘sudden limb failure’ or
‘summer branch drop’.24 The cause of this tendency is unclear,
however, some species of tree are more likely to drop
branches in this
2.26 Certain stressors may increase the likelihood of branches and trees
falling, such as: windy conditions, extreme temperatures
or changes in
temperature, drought, fire, flooding or excessive branch weight. Branches may
also break off and drop when a tree
dies or when the branch itself begins to
decay or die.26
Yang v Scerri,
27 the affected neighbour sought the removal of
a Sydney blue gum on her neighbour’s property on the basis that it was
to cause damage or injury in the near future. One of the tree’s
trunks and some branches had already broken away without warning
and fallen,
damaging her unit. The affected neighbour sought compensation for the cost of
legal action and for the insurance excess
incurred in the most recent incident.
The tree owner opposed the tree’s removal and argued, on the
basis of an arboricultural report, that the tree was in good health, and that
it was likely to live for another 15–20 years.
The tree owner also
submitted that maintenance orders for pruning and removal of deadwood, and
annual inspections, were preferable
to the removal of the entire tree.
2.28 The NSWLEC, after inspecting the tree, agreed that there were no
structural weaknesses in the tree and determined that removal
was not necessary
as the tree was not likely to cause damage or injury in the future. Instead, the
Court made orders for the pruning
of branches, removal of deadwood and
inspections of the tree.28
19 The Court noted there were other trees on the affected neighbours land and
other adjoining properties that could have contributed
to the leaf litter in the

Falling trees
2.29 A tree may cause damage to neighbouring property by falling across
boundary lines. Even healthy trees can be completely uprooted
during strong
winds.29 It can be difficult to predict when and which way a tree is likely to
Robson v Leischke,
31 the leading case in New South Wales,
provides an example of a tree falling across boundary lines onto neighbouring
On a windy evening, an 80-year-old ironbark tree, 16 metres high and
situated on private land, fell onto
neighbouring land, causing significant damage to the roof, ceilings, windows
and other parts of the house and consequential water
damage to the interior.
2.31 As a result of the damage, the house was unable to be occupied for 15
weeks. The tree owner’s insurance company denied
liability, as it claimed
the tree had fallen in a storm, not as a result of the tree owner’s
negligence. The insurer told the
affected neighbour it would ‘vigorously
defend’ any claims for compensation. The affected neighbour brought legal
in the NSWLEC for compensation for loss of rent during this time, as well
as expenses for rectification works.
2.32 The tree owner defended these claims primarily on the basis that the
tree’s fall was not his fault. He also argued that
the claims for
compensation were excessive and inappropriate.
2.33 The tree owner engaged an arborist who examined the tree as well as
photographs taken at the time it fell. Based on the photographs,
the arborist
did not observe any of the
usual indications of poor health32 but physical inspection of the fallen tree
revealed that the lower tree trunk had minor fungal
damage due to a root
disease. The damage was located underground and had only become visible because
the tree had fallen.
2.34 The arborist determined that the tree fell due to a combination of
storms, water-logged soil and root damage. The presence of
the root disease was
attributed to the construction of a retaining wall and other site modifications
that had impacted the tree’s
The arborist considered that the root disease, although usually a cause for
concern, would not have been obvious on inspection before
the tree fell.
Furthermore, the tree was not known to be a problematic species and no one,
including the affected neighbours, had
ever reported any problems with it.
2.35 Chief Justice Preston determined that the tree owner had no knowledge
its failure or the
loss suffered by the affected neighbour. He determined: ‘In these
circumstances, the justice of the situation
leave the loss where it falls, namely on [the affected neighbour]’.33
The application was dismissed.
Encroaching roots
2.36 While branches that overhang boundary lines can be easily seen, the
extension of a tree’s root system into neighbouring
land at a subterranean
level is not as visible. Encroaching roots can cause structural damage by
putting pressure on built structures
or affecting their foundations, either
directly or by changing the water content of the subsoil.34 Roots can also
create hazards
by cracking concrete walkways or creating uneven ground.

2.37 It is a common myth that the root system of a tree is found deep in
the soil and extends as far as the edge of its canopy.
In fact, root systems
grow in the shallower layers of soil and can extend far beyond the equivalent
reach of a tree’s canopy.35
2.38 The growth of roots can depend on the soil conditions.36 Uncompacted
soil is well- aerated and ideal for root growth. Compacted
soil of the kind
commonly found in built, urban environments contains lower levels of oxygen and
water. Roots in this kind of soil
oxygen, water and other nutrients. More favourable conditions can include the
soil around cracked or leaking sewers, drains and pipes.37
2.39 The amount of pressure tree roots are able to put on built structures
depends on many environmental factors. While tree root
pressure can affect
pavements and walls, it is not strong enough to penetrate significant structural
obstructions, such as pipes.
If tree roots encounter an obstruction that cannot
be penetrated, they will usually grow around it.38
Tree roots sometimes enter pipes and cause blockages by growing in them if
the pipe is already weakened or cracked.39 Roots also
grow along the exterior
of a pipe to access water condensation that has gathered on its surface.40
2.40 Tree roots can also cause the swelling and shrinking of subsoil
underneath the topsoil.
Changes in moisture brought about by the water intake of the tree can cause
volume changes in the soil which in turn can lead to cracked
foundations.41
2.41 The extent to which tree roots encroach depends on complex ecological
Moreover, whether or not damage to property is attributable to encroaching
tree roots may be difficult to prove.
Cacopardo v Woolcock,
42 the affected neighbours noticed
problems with the plumbing in their main bathroom. They contacted a plumber who
found roots believed
to be from their neighbour’s fig tree in their pipe
system. A short while later, they noticed further problems caused by the
of the same roots in the pipes of their ensuite. The plumbing work required
cutting away the concrete foundations, leaving
both bathrooms in significant
2.43 The affected neighbours engaged an arborist who confirmed that the roots
found in the pipes were from the neighbouring fig. The
affected neighbours wrote
to the tree owner’s lawyers and demanded to be paid compensation for the
root damage. The tree owners
responded that the fig tree had been cut down and
removed, and that they had been advised by their own expert plumbers that the
experienced by the neighbours were due to pre-existing cracks in the
pipes. They also queried whether the roots did in fact belong
to their fig tree
and not another tree.
2.44 The affected neighbours carried out further excavation works to identify
the tree the roots belonged to, removing concrete from
footpaths and incurring
further expense. By the time the matter was brought before QCAT, the affected
neighbours were seeking compensation
of over $20,000.
2.45 At the hearing, parties relied on the expert evidence of their
respective arborists. The tree owners relied on the additional
expert evidence
of a plumber. All experts agreed that
the pipes had cracked before the entry of tree roots but did not agree on its
cause. The tree owners’ experts stated that the
moisture level of the
ground following rainfall was

penetrate pipes of sound quality but some disagree with this:

the main factor leading to the ground movement that caused the cracking. The
affected neighbours’ expert stated that moisture
levels causing soil
movement had ‘ultimately cause[d] the pipes to break, due to the roots
drawing moisture from the soil,
and thereby contributing to the contraction of
the soil as it lost moisture’.43
2.46 The Tribunal determined that the roots did indeed belong to the fig tree
but that, as expressed by the majority view of the experts,
failed in consequence of soil movement, caused by soil moisture attributable to
rainfall patterns; and, that it
was only after the pipes had already failed that
the fig tree roots then gained access to them, thus eventually causing a

roots was ‘merely the event that informed the [affected neighbours]

was dismissed.
Smith v Zhang
,45 the affected neighbours noticed cracks
in the external and internal brick wall of their study. An engineer attributed
this damage
to a large root belonging to a Sydney blue gum on their
neighbour’s property. They could not make an insurance
claim as they were not covered for damage from tree roots. The couple tried
to negotiate with the tree owners but these negotiations
failed. This tree was
also protected by the local council; unauthorised works would result in a fine
of $1.1 million dollars.
2.48 The affected neighbours took the matter to the NSWLEC to seek removal of
the tree and rectification costs of almost $50,000.
After a site inspection and
excavation, the Court agreed with the tree owners’ expert witnesses who
claimed the damage was
not due to the tree root but other structural and
ecological factors.
Marshall v Berndt
,46 the affected neighbour was an amateur
botanist. In her backyard were many aquatic tanks, used to grow water lilies and
2.50 She and her neighbour had had disputes over tree root damage to her land
and boundary fence for more than 10 years. Their relationship
was described as
2.51 The longstanding dispute culminated in a month-long trial in the County
Court of Victoria. The affected neighbour brought legal
action against the tree
owner for the encroachment of trees, vines and creepers that caused damage to
brick paving, aquatic tanks,
and plants and fish in the tanks. She stated that
she had tried to cut off as
much encroaching ivy as she could but that the aquatic tanks were in the
way.47 She claimed that the encroachment constituted a nuisance
and that the
tree owner had
been negligent, and sought $95,700 in compensation for rectification works
and for the replacement of her plants.
2.52 The tree owner told the Court that he had planted some trees in the past
to block out the view of the affected neighbour’s
aquarium tanks and
conceded that although he removed some of the subject trees and took care to
trim them, he had at times ignored
the affected neighbour’s claims of root
damage and had delayed their removal.
2.53 The Court determined that, because the tree owner ignored early
communication with the affected neighbour about the root encroachment,
liable for some of the root damage, namely to the pavement and minor damage to
the tropical house and garden shed. The Court
awarded the affected neighbour
$5,000 for this damage. Other damage to her back porch and lounge was attributed
to structural defects
and geological causes.

Harm to people
2.54 Trees may cause harm (known as ‘injury’ in some
including by triggering allergies, causing injury from falling branches or
trees,49 or creating trip hazards from structures
compromised by root
Health conditions
2.55 Heath conditions may be caused or exacerbated by pollen, leaf litter,
flowers or fruit from a tree.
2.56 Pollen is a known cause of allergies. The pollen of a tree is
disseminated by wind, bees and birds. Pollen can trigger allergies
hayfever or respiratory conditions such as asthma.51 The timing of pollination
changes depending on the tree species.52
Leonardi v Watson,
53 the affected neighbour sought the
removal of their neighbour’s Indian raintree due to her allergies. She
claimed that the
‘pollen affects her breathing; causes a burning
sensation down her throat; her eyes swell and become infected; she develops
blotches on her skin similar to measles; it affects the skin between her fingers
and her toes and the soles of her feet’. A
pollen test returned positive
results and also indicated that she was allergic to plastics. The tree was
ordered to be removed because
of these allergies. However, on appeal, the
original decision was overturned and the application dismissed. The Appeal
Tribunal determined
• The affected neighbour’s allergies did not satisfy the
‘serious injury’ threshold as evidenced by her doctor’s
assessment,54 her own assessment,55 and the fact that her medication was
recommended to her rather than prescribed.56
• It could not be conclusively proven that the tree was the sole cause
of her allergies57
or that the tree’s removal would prevent the reaction.58
2.58 Other health conditions may result when leaf litter and other tree
products cause contamination, for example, of a neighbour’s
2.59 In the 1917 New Zealand case
Matthews v Forgie
,59 the tree owner
had some Macrocarpa trees which grew close to the boundary of his land.
2.60 The tree owner’s land and the affected neighbour’s land were
separated by a road.
However, during southerly and south-westerly winds, leaf litter from the
trees was blown across the road onto the affected neighbour’s
2.61 The leaf litter polluted the neighbour’s rainwater tanks which
were his only water supply for drinking and domestic uses.
The neighbour alleged
that, as a result of the contamination, he contracted dysentery. He brought
legal action against the tree owner
for damages.
48 As well as causing harm to people, subject trees may also harm pets and
livestock on an affected neighbour’s land. For example,

2.62 Initially, the New Zealand Magistrates’ Court determined that the
affected neighbour was entitled to recover damages for
his suffering and loss of
earnings during the two weeks
he was ill.60 However, on appeal, the Supreme Court of New Zealand determined
that the tree owner was not liable for the harm suffered
because the trees
themselves were not noxious,61 nor did they constitute a nuisance. The appeal
was allowed and judgment in favour
of the tree owner was recorded in the
Magistrates’ Court.
Falling branches or trees
2.63 Dropping branches or falling trees can pose risks to health and safety,
and cause injury or even death.62
Huggett v Burrowes,
63 the affected neighbour sought the
removal of a lemon-scented gum, arguing that it was likely to cause injury by
dropping branches.
The tree was located on neighbouring land close to the
boundary, with over half of its canopy overhanging the affected
neighbour’s
2.65 Two other trees of the same species and size had previously been removed
after they had fallen on the affected neighbour’s
land following windy
conditions and prolonged rain, causing damage to the affected neighbour’s
2.66 The remaining tree had previously dropped three large branches. These
branches were healthy and fell without warning in calm
conditions. The second
fell on the affected neighbour’s clothes line. The affected neighbour told
the NSWLEC that had ‘anyone
been hanging out the washing at the time then
serious injury could have occurred’.64
2.67 The Court determined that given the previous multiple episodes of
branches dropping unpredictably, it was likely the same could
occur again in the
near future and cause injury. The tree was ordered to be removed.

to each other in
respectful and constructive ways.
2.73 Trees can adversely affect neighbouring land or cause harm in many ways,
particularly from encroachment of branches or roots.
2.74 However, trees are not by nature intrusive or hazardous. Trees need to
grow, and therefore take up space, to stay alive. There
are complex biological
and ecological factors that affect the way a tree grows.69 It is important to
take these factors into consideration
when planting and maintaining trees,
particularly in built environments where neighbours live in close proximity to
one another.

examples of neighbourhood tree disputes in Victoria, and whether
and how they
were resolved.

48 Conclusion
3. Resolving neighbourhood tree disputes
in Victoria
Introduction
3.1 In Victoria, neighbours are encouraged to resolve their tree disputes
informally,
through negotiation and discussion. Parties to a dispute can access online
resources, or contact legal and government agencies for
guidance in
understanding their rights and responsibilities, and resolving their
3.2 Where the informal approach is ineffective, formal dispute resolution is
available, with court proceedings as the final step
to seeking a binding
resolution of the dispute.
3.3 However, navigating these steps can be confusing, as it is difficult to
find definitive statements of rights and responsibilities
relating to tree
issues. In Victoria, the law is based on the common law, including the torts of
nuisance, negligence and trespass.1
This is true for other states and territories in Australia with the exception
of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, which have
enacted legislation. A
table setting out the common law torts and their equivalent interstate statutory
provisions is set out at
the Appendix.
3.4 This chapter sets out the steps that neighbours in Victoria can take to
resolve tree disputes.
Process in Victoria
3.5 In Victoria, the resolution of tree disputes can be approached in a
number of ways. The process is made up of several independent
stages. These can
include, depending on the cause of the dispute:
• making an insurance claim
• self-help and tree trimming
• attempting informal resolution
• engaging in formal alternative dispute resolution, or
• court proceedings.
3.6 Each of these stages is discussed in more detail below.
1 These are discussed in detail below at [3.97] –
Insurance claims
3.7 One of the first steps an affected neighbour may take when a tree on
neighbouring land damages their property is to contact their
3.8 This is commonly the case when there has been major damage to property,
especially during storm events which can cause trees
3.9 Household insurance may cover damage caused by trees.2 These policies
generally cover
‘the cost of rebuilding or repairing your home’ when damage
occurs in circumstances that are out of the policy holder’s
including natural disasters and storms.3 However,
the scope of the cover differs from one insurer to another. Coverage details
are contained in the individual policy’s product
statement.4
3.10 Generally speaking, a householder’s insurance will only cover
their property
their trees
. Where a tree falls
across boundary lines and damages a neighbour’s property, the likely
course of action is for the affected
neighbour to claim on their own
insurance.5
3.11 Where the tree owner can be shown to be at fault (for example they
have knowledge of the poor condition of the tree), the
neighbour’s insurance company may seek to recover from the tree
owner’s insurance company.
3.12 For parts of a house not generally included in standard household cover,
for example a garden shed, insurance providers may require
the purchase of
additional cover for damage caused to them.
3.13 Common insurance exclusions relevant to damage caused by trees include
damage caused by the growth of tree roots, and by the
lopping or removal of
trees or branches that have fallen onto the land without causing any
3.14 Access to an insurance payout may not affect legal liability if an
affected neighbour then pursues legal action. It may, however,
whom the payment is made’: the insurance company may be reimbursed, rather
than the affected neighbour receiving
damages as well as an insurance
3.15 Additionally, where legal action is pursued, a tree owner’s
household public liability insurance may cover legal costs,
or the amount of
compensation they are required to pay, where the condition of their property,
including any subject tree, caused
damage to neighbouring property or injury to
3.16 Insurance cannot, however, prevent damage, with a claim only
possible once damage or injury has occurred. An insurance
provider cannot
enforce pre-emptive measures such as trimming, pruning or removing a tree to
prevent damage.
Abatement/’self-help’
3.17 Affected neighbours may sometimes take matters into their own hands, and
trim back neighbours’ trees that overhang their
property. This type of
self-help is called ‘abatement’, a remedy developed under the common

Giallousis v Malcolm
[2014] QCATA 337
(8 December 2014).
3.18 The common law allows ‘this private and summary method of doing
one’s self justice
... because injuries of this kind, which obstruct or annoy such things as are
of daily convenience and use, require an immediate remedy
and cannot wait for
the slow progress of the ordinary forms of law’.8
3.19 In some cases, abatement may be a timely solution to a tree dispute. In
other cases, trimming back to the boundary line and returning
the branches can
cause further conflict.
3.20 There are two ways in which an affected neighbour can abate a nuisance
caused by a tree:
• by removing encroaching parts of the tree, usually branches or roots,
up to the boundary line or installing preventative measures
such as underground
root barriers,9 or
• by physically entering the tree owner’s property to remove the
interference caused by the tree.10
3.21 Abating up to the boundary line is advised and encouraged where
appropriate.11 It is useful in situations where a part of a tree
has encroached
over boundary lines but has not caused the level of
interference—unreasonable interference—needed to establish
or has not yet caused actual physical damage. Such action can potentially
prevent damage. However, there is no right to anticipatory action without
encroachment. That is, a neighbour cannot trim branches
encroachment.12
3.22 Any encroaching branches or roots that are removed remain the property
of the tree owner, and must be returned, in order to avoid
liability for the
separate tort of conversion.13 An affected neighbour does not need to give
notice to the tree owner to abate up
to the boundary line.14
3.23 Abatement by entering the tree owner’s property is justified only
where ‘there is immediate danger to life or health
so as to render it
unsafe to wait’,15 and it is considered prudent to notify the property
owner before entering their land.16
Abating in this way also means that the
affected neighbour will lose their right to claim damages for the nuisance,
because of ‘the
degree of self-help and potential damage to the other
party involved in going on to the land of the other party, and interfering
3.24 An affected neighbour must abate cautiously to avoid damage and ensure
that they do not trespass or act negligently.18

tree preservation order will limit the ability of an affected
neighbour to
3.26 Where it is not possible or appropriate to abate,21 an affected
neighbour may bring proceedings in court to seek an injunction
or damages.22
Neighbour-led dispute resolution
3.27 Neighbours may seek to resolve problems relating to trees informally,
without the involvement of lawyers or formal dispute resolution.
Abatement may
be carried out as a result of successful informal dispute resolution.
3.28 People with concerns about trees or who are experiencing tree disputes
will often seek out information about their rights and
responsibilities in order
to resolve the problem for themselves. They may also engage a tree professional,
such as an arborist, for
an expert assessment before or after approaching their
neighbour informally to discuss the situation and negotiate a resolution.
3.29 Some government and community organisations have published useful
resources aimed at helping neighbours resolve their tree dispute.
Most emphasise
resolving disputes informally wherever possible. These resources are guides
only, providing general information. They
are also not intended to provide legal
advice. Some neighbours in more complex circumstances may find limited support
for informally
resolving their dispute.
3.30 The following paragraphs contain advice on information resources
available to neighbours, informal communication methods, and
the role of
arborists in tree disputes.
Information sources
3.31 There are a number of resources available that explain the law and
provide tools for resolving disputes.
3.32 Most resources, such as those provided by the Dispute Settlement Centre
of Victoria (DSCV), Victoria Law Foundation, and Victoria
Legal Aid23 emphasise
maintaining harmonious neighbour relationships so that conflict can be avoided
and a constructive resolution
may be reached.24
3.33 The DSCV website gives a general outline of the law, sets out answers to
frequently asked questions about trees, and provides
a step-by-step guide to
seeking a reasonable resolution.25

it is stated that the affected neighbour has a duty to mitigate damages and,
where abatement is carried out to do so, then
cost is recoverable. Hodgson J
quotes Jenkins LJ in
Davey v Horrow Corporation
[1957] 2 All ER 305
‘Is there any duty to mitigate? Can a person who sees encroaching roots on
his land build a house and wait for it to fall
down?’ and continues that,
in his view, an affected neighbour ‘does, nevertheless, have the usual
obligation to mitigate
damages; and accordingly, he has the obligation to take
reasonable steps to keep these damages to a minimum, and has the corresponding
right to claim from the adjoining owner the expenses associated with these
reasonable steps.’ [487]. See also Paula Giliker,

(20 August 2017) where
the Tribunal stated that abating overhanging branches in this case
‘is not a practical option where the centre of the trunks of the trees
are between 18 cm and 67 cm from the boundary. To trim
the trees to the boundary
would almost certainly render the trees highly unstable and perhaps kill
them.’ [10].

Neighbours, the Law and You
gives a general overview of issues to be aware of, including what local
councils can help with and the practicalities of abatement,
as well as providing
links to the DSCV and to the Magistrates’ Court websites.26
3.35 Victoria Law Foundation promotes informal dispute resolution, noting
constructively working out any problems together with your neighbour is the
way to maintain a good relationship with them so you can deal with any future
issues. Whatever the problem, in most cases your best
option is to try to
resolve it by talking with your neighbour and sorting it out in a friendly and
informal way. This approach is
most likely to result in the best solution for
you both.27

and ‘self-help’ (abatement), and offers practical tips.28

3.39 Common themes contained in the information sources outlined above
• approaching neighbours calmly and respectfully
• explaining concerns clearly and openly
• considering the neighbours’ point of view
• workshopping possible solutions
• seeking professional advice and quotations where necessary, so each
party can negotiate from an informed position
• the desirability of reaching a solution, as neighbour disputes can
easily escalate and have detrimental effects on both parties’
3.40 DSCV also provides conflict coaching and dispute resolution advice
over the phone, including options, strategies and negotiation
techniques to help
people resolve their disputes between themselves.
Engaging a tree professional
3.41 Public information on tree disputes often recommends that people engage
a tree professional, usually an arborist, to conduct
an assessment of the tree
in question.29
3.42 The Commission was informed by arborists that they have varying levels
of engagement in private disputes. Where the neighbours’
relationship is
amicable, an arborist may discuss with the non-commissioning neighbour the
extent of any issue, and their reasoning
for coming to conclusions about the
tree’s health or risk profile. This type of informal advice from a tree
professional may
3.43 Commonly, however, by the time an arborist is engaged by one neighbour,
the relationship has soured to the extent that the commissioning
neighbour does
the arborist to speak to the other neighbour, or even to be seen to be
inspecting the tree. The Commission has heard anecdotal stories
being asked to park around the corner, or to assess a tree when the neighbour is
away from home. This presents

29 See discussion of these materials above at [3.31] –
some difficulties where the tree is on neighbouring land. In these
situations, arborists are unable to make a full physical inspection,
and have to
make a visual assessment from across a fence. In this case, where evidence about
the tree’s health or its potential
to cause damage or harm cannot be
gathered direct from the tree, the arborist may be limited to general statements
of opinion.
3.44 Arborists will often be wary of providing any opinion on legal matters
to clients, and
may instead refer them to DSCV, the Magistrates’ Court or their local
council if the tree is protected under local laws. The
same is true for industry
organisations which frequently receive calls from neighbours asking about their
rights and responsibilities.30
3.45 Instead, arborists can provide a report setting out their observations
of the tree’s condition, health and recommendations
for, typically,
management or removal of a tree.
3.46 While there is no standard definition of ‘arborist’, most
are qualified in accordance
with various levels of the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF).31 For
example, an AQF Level 3 arborist would hold a Certificate
III in arboriculture
and have the skills and knowledge to work as an arboricultural tradesperson and
provide basic tree care and
management, amongst other things. An AQF Level 5
arborist would hold a diploma and be able to work independently as a consultant
or in a supervisory role.
3.47 More highly qualified arborists may have a better understanding of how a
tree’s health can be properly managed in the long
term. It is not clear
how much weight community members give to whether or not an arborist is suitably
qualified to carry out tree
works or assessments. Information on what level of
qualification is advisable is not easily accessible to private members of the
community.32
3.48 Arboricultural organisations commonly advise that arborists of minimum
AQF Level 3 should be engaged for tree works, such as
pruning or lopping.33
However, if the tree’s health and associated risks need to be assessed,
then engaging an arborist with
minimum AQF Level 5 qualifications is necessary
because these are more complex assessments that
‘require a high level of training, knowledge and
experience’.34
3.49 Where informal neighbour negotiations are not successful, the next step
is often to undertake a form of structured dispute resolution,
Alternative dispute resolution
3.50 Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) refers to any formal process, other
than judicial (court) determination, in which an impartial
person assists
parties to resolve their dispute. There are many forms of ADR, ranging from the
facilitative and exploratory (mediation),
active and advisory (conciliation),
through to processes that decide the result (arbitration).
3.51 There are many private practitioners working in each of these forms of
ADR, who may be engaged by people experiencing a dispute.
3.52 The primary means of resolving tree disputes in Victoria is through the
voluntary mediation service provided free of charge,

has introduced a voluntary industry licence to
promote quality of practice: Arboriculture Australia,

provides dispute resolution services across 14 metropolitan
and regional
locations in Victoria.
Services and process
3.54 As noted above, DSCV maintains a comprehensive and informative website
with general information on dispute resolution techniques
and resources. It also
provides clear and simple guidance on the law and processes involved in the
resolution of common tree disputes,
including links to other information sources
such as those discussed above
at [3.31] – [3.38]. The site lists frequently asked questions about
tree issues in Victoria, addressing common issues in simple
and accessible
language.35
3.55 Dispute Assessment Officers (DAOs) within DSCV are the first point of
makes initial
• listening to clients’ concerns
• helping to clarify the issues
• answering questions
• providing techniques and strategies for resolving the dispute
• referring clients to other specialist services where needed.
3.56 With the client’s consent, DAOs may also contact the other party
to the dispute.36 Where the other party agrees to participate,
the DAO will
work to identify the issues in the dispute, suggest options to parties and try
to resolve the matter separately with
each party over the phone. If this fails,
the dispute may be referred to accredited mediators within DSCV.
3.57 If a dispute is assessed as suitable for mediation,37 it can be
scheduled quickly (generally within two weeks of referral) and
location suitable to the parties. Mediation is voluntary and proceedings are
confidential. The mediator will invite the
parties to share their views, and
explain what has led them into dispute, and what they propose will resolve the
issue. Parties may
be in the same room, or in separate rooms, with a mediator
acting as an intermediary.
3.58 This mediated assistance in exploring the issues, developing options and
assessing alternative outcomes, if successful, results
in a written agreement. A
high proportion
of DSCV mediations end in agreements,38 although these agreements reached in
mediations are not otherwise binding.39
3.59 DSCV also administers a Magistrates’ Court Civil Claims Program,
handling referrals for mediation from the Court.40 If
mediation is successful, a
court hearing is avoided. After mediation, DSCV communicates the outcome back to
the Court. The mediated
agreements generally take the form of consent orders,
terms of settlement, or the filing of a notice of discontinuance.41

Volume of tree disputes at DSCV
3.60 Disputes relating to trees42 are the third most common subject of
inquiries to the DSCV, representing around 17 per cent of
their work.43
3.61 Information provided to the Commission by DSCV analyses the 18,727 out
of 109,039 cases relating to trees, shrubs and creepers,
recorded over the
5.5-year period from December 2011 to May 2017.
3.62 The data provided shows that the proportion of tree disputes that
progress further through the DSCV framework is relatively low.
In the relevant
period, 11.3 per cent of tree disputes involved an ‘approach’,
inviting the other party to participate
in dispute resolution.44 The total rate
of DSCV-facilitated resolution over the relevant period is
5.3 per cent, or 922 cases.45
3.63 Of these, DSCV was able to facilitate a resolution before formal
mediation in 4.1 per cent of cases, and a further 1.2 per cent
was brought to
mediation.46
3.64 DSCV also provided a breakdown of cases received by season,
highlighting a clear increase in enquiries in the spring months.
The proportion
of enquiries made in summer was also markedly higher than in autumn or

dispute? What was your experience?
Court proceedings
3.65 Parties in conflict over a tree may litigate their dispute in court, an
option which is often described as the avenue of last
resort.48 Courts in
Victoria are able to hear and determine tree disputes according to the common
law, described in more detail
below from [3.91] – [3.226].
3.66 If one party decides to take their dispute to court, it will usually be
heard in the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria. Some
cases involving large
claims will be heard in the County Court of Victoria, or, in cases involving
very large or complex claims,
in the Supreme Court of Victoria.
3.67 Once a claim has been received by a court, the court itself may order
that parties participate in mediation, or another form
of court-ordered dispute
resolution, before the case can be heard by a judge or other decision maker.
3.68 The jurisdiction, scope and fees of the Magistrates’ Court, County
Court and Supreme
Court (as relevant to tree disputes) are discussed in more detail below.
42 Cases are assigned one main issue type upon intake with the DSCV. Many
disputes involve multiple issues: these statistics reflect
disputes that were
categorised on intake as relating to ‘trees’, ‘shrubs’
or ‘creepers’. These
disputes are collectively referred to as
‘tree disputes’ for the purpose of analysing DSCV’s
43 Email from Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria to Victorian Law Reform
Commission, 10 August 2017.
44 The information provided by DSCV notes that the average approach rate
across all dispute types is 15–25%.
45 Ibid. DSCV notes that the overall resolution rate across all disputes is
around 15–16%, and that tree disputes thus have
a low resolution rate.

Magistrates’ Court of Victoria
3.69 The Magistrates’ Court has jurisdiction to hear civil matters
where claims for works or damages are no more than $100,000.49
3.70 Bringing a case before the Magistrates’ Court can be costly. The
application/filing fee depends on the amount being claimed,
and ranges from $145
(for claims under $500), to
$691.10 (for claims over $70,000). Other fees, for example for serving
documents on the other party ($69), may apply.50 These are
generally applied on
a sliding scale by reference to the value claimed for works or damages.51
County Court of Victoria
3.71 The County Court has original, unlimited jurisdiction in all civil
3.72 The civil jurisdiction of the Court is divided into two divisions: the
Commercial Division and the Common Law Division. The Common
Law Division
includes ‘any proceeding
in which the plaintiff claims the recovery of damages founded in
tort’.53 Costs to have a matter heard in the County Court
significant, particularly where the amounts claimed are small. The basic filing
fee is $851.80.54
3.73 Although there are not many published neighbourhood tree dispute cases
from the Victorian higher courts, the majority of those
reviewed by the
Commission were initiated in the Magistrates’ Court, and later transferred
or ‘uplifted’ to the
County Court.55
3.74 The cost of transferring a matter from the Magistrates’ Court (for
example, when the amount claimed unexpectedly exceeds
the Magistrates’
Court’s $100,000 jurisdictional limits) is also $851.50, minus the
original fee already paid to the
Magistrates’ Court.
3.75 Additional daily hearing fees start at $523.30 for the second day, and
increase to $1459 for the tenth and any subsequent days.56
Supreme Court of Victoria
3.76 The Supreme Court also has original, unlimited jurisdiction in all civil
3.77 The Common Law Division manages claims in property, tort and
contract law. Cases in the division are allocated into one
of the varied
specialist lists, which include the Major Torts List, the Valuation,
Compensation and Planning List, and the Civil
Circuit List.
3.78 The Major Torts List is ‘designed to facilitate and expedite the
passage of large or otherwise significant tortious claims
to trial’. The
Commission did not find many recent recorded cases in the Supreme Court
involving tree disputes between neighbours.58
3.79 Costs in the Supreme Court are higher than in the Magistrates’ or
County Court. The cost to file an originating motion
is $1065.10. Hearing fees
for days or part-days in the Common Law Division begin at $654.10, increasing to

and subsequent days, and to $1824.40 for the tenth and
subsequent days.59

tree dispute? What was your experience?
Law in Victoria
Legislation affecting tree disputes
3.81 In Victoria, the management and removal of trees can be affected in some
circumstances by legislation dealing with land management,
land protection and
public safety. These laws do not address the resolution of tree disputes more
generally, but may be relevant
to the rights and responsibilities of parties in
some disputes.
3.82 Some of these laws, including local laws, stipulate what should happen
to a tree that causes (or is likely to cause) damage or
harm, as well as the
scope of a tree owner’s liability where they fail to appropriately
maintain a tree.
Planning and Environment Act 1987
(Vic) provides the legal
framework for Victoria’s planning system. Overlays and planning controls
under this framework may affect
individuals’ ability to manage trees on
private land.
Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008
(Vic) contains an
offence of creating a nuisance.60 Where a nuisance is reported and is found to
be ‘dangerous to health or
offensive’, councils must investigate and
may, in limited circumstances, enter private property to ‘take appropriate
action’ to manage the nuisance.61
3.85 It is theoretically possible for this Act to be used in the management
of private tree disputes. However, given limited council
resources and the fact
that they generally have no formal involvement in private disputes, it is most
likely that councils would
that such matters are more appropriately resolved privately, and choose to
refer people to other resolution options.62 The Commission
found no examples of
a council using this Act for this purpose.
3.86 Under the
Fences Act 1968
(Vic), neighbours can recoup costs or
request certain works where:
• a dividing fence is negligently or deliberately damaged or destroyed
by a tree, such as where the tree owner has failed to
rectify or remove a tree
that poses a risk of damage. The tree owner will be liable for the entire cost
of repairs to the dividing
• a dividing fence is in the form of a ‘vegetative
barrier’, allowing neighbours to serve on each other a ‘Notice
Fence’ containing requests for works such as the ‘planting,
replanting, repair or maintenance of a hedge or similar
vegetative barrier that
is the whole or part of a dividing fence’.64
Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008
s 62(3)(b).
This is discussed further at [4.92] – [4.96].
Fences Act 1968
3.87 Other laws that compel people to remove vegetation on their land
Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994
(Vic), under which
an owner of land may be directed to remove specified noxious weeds.65
Country Fire Authority Act 1958
(Vic), under which local
councils may issue Fire Prevention Notices to an owner of land requiring them to
remove vegetation fuel hazards.66
Electricity Safety Act 1998
(Vic), which requires a tree
owner to keep their trees clear of any power lines or to carry out certain works

3.90 There is currently no legislation specific to the process for resolving
private tree disputes between neighbours in Victoria.68
The common law
3.91 The resolution of tree disputes in Victoria is based on the law of
torts, which has largely been developed through judge-made
case law, or the
‘common law’.69
3.92 A tort is a ‘legal wrong’ that confers civil liability on
the wrongdoer.70 Torts cover a variety of acts or omissions
that infringe on a
person’s ‘fundamental liberties, such as personal liberty, and
fundamental rights, such as property
rights, and provide protection from
interferences’.71
3.93 In order to bring a tree dispute to court, neighbours will usually have
to rely on one or more of the torts of nuisance, negligence
and trespass.72

document, but rather are contained

3.94 In recent times, certain torts have undergone law reform. Their common
law principles and elements are now largely restated in,
clarified by or altered
by statute.73 This is particularly true of negligence, which has been given a
statutory framework in the
respective civil liability statutes of each state and
territory.74
3.95 These torts, their defences and available remedies are explored below in
further detail.75
As the development of the common law is incremental and case-based, a high
level of detail is necessary to explain it fully, and to
address the need for
completeness in the Commission’s review of this part of the law.
3.96 While some general principles are examined, discussion of each tort is
limited to the extent it is relevant to tree disputes
previously decided by the
Table 1: Overview of relevant torts
Circumstances that give rise to the tort
Where there is or is likely to be unreasonable interference: (a) with the
use and enjoyment of land, or
(b) that causes damage to property.
Where damage, loss or injury results from a negligent act.
Where an invasion of land has occurred.
3.97 The tort (civil wrong) of nuisance can be classified as a public
nuisance, or a private nuisance.76 Neighbours in tree disputes
will rely on
private nuisance.77
3.98 As a general rule, nuisance deals with the ‘reciprocal rights and
duties of private individuals’78 and their ‘conflicts
competing uses of land’.79 Nuisance claims in tree disputes are often a
balancing exercise between:
• the tree owner’s right to enjoy and use their land in any
lawful manner that they see fit, and
• the affected neighbour’s right to use and enjoy their land
without unreasonable interference.80
3.99 In legal terms, a nuisance relates to an act or omission that causes
unreasonable interference with the affected neighbour’s
land or their
enjoyment of land.81 It is ‘a tort directed against the plaintiff’s
enjoyment of their rights over the
land’82 and is inextricably linked to a
person’s proprietary interests over land they occupy.
3.100 In the context of tree disputes, nuisance covers situations where a
• encroaches on neighbouring land
• causes physical damage to neighbouring land, or

3.101 Time limits apply to legal actions in tort. In the case of nuisance, an
affected neighbour must bring legal action for nuisance
within six years of the
date the nuisance occurred.84
Establishing nuisance
3.102 In order to establish nuisance, the affected neighbour must have
the right to bring a claim (have ‘standing’)
and must have
experienced unreasonable interference for which the tree owner is liable.
Affected neighbour must have standing
3.103 As the tort of nuisance exists to remedy unreasonable interference with
a person’s use and enjoyment of their land,85
the affected neighbour must
be in actual possession of the land in order to have standing to bring a
3.104 Three types of occupants of land have standing in private nuisance:
freehold owners in possession of land, and tenants or licensees
with exclusive
possession.87
3.105 Where the property is leased, only the tenant, who has actual
possession of the land and is affected by the nuisance, will have
standing to
sue. However, where the nuisance causes damage of a permanent nature to the
reversionary interest in land, the landlord
may also have standing to sue even
though they are not in actual possession of the land.88
Interference must be unreasonable
3.106 Although nuisance is generally interpreted as unreasonable
interference with the use and enjoyment of land, case law has developed
nuisance to be claimed for unreasonable interference resulting in damage to
property.89 The two outcomes attract different
considerations.
Unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment of land
3.107 Unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment of land is typically
relied on for interference which intrudes onto the affected
neighbour’s
land.90 In the context of tree disputes, examples of this could include leaf
litter,91 or the spread of pollen92
or seeds.93
Importantly, there is no need to prove that actual physical damage has
resulted from a nuisance.
St Helen’s Smelting Co v Tipping
(1865) 11 ER 1483. It
is generally accepted that interference resulting in personal injury has been
absorbed by the law of negligence:
Burnie Port Authority v General Jones
[1994] HCA 13
(1994) 120 ALR 42
where the High Court of Australia absorbed the
Rylands v Fletcher
[1866] LR 1 Ex at 280 into the tort of
negligence. See also
Robson v Leischke
[2008] NSWLR 98
[49]. Trindade and
Cane elaborate that ‘claims for past personal injury or damage to property
framed as nuisance are ‘likely
to be treated as ... claim[s] in
negligence’. Kit Barker, Peter Cane, Mark Lunney and Francis Trindade,
The Law of Torts in Australia
(Oxford University Press, 5th ed, 2012)
216. Contrary to this, some case law has still not dismissed nuisance as an
appropriate cause
or action for personal injury: see, eg,
Pelmonthe v
(1889) 20 LR(NSW)(L) 58 and
Wilson v New South Wales Land and
Housing Corp
[1998] ANZ Conv R 623
, which assert that nuisance may be
successfully relied on where negligence has not been made out. Negligence is

Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing
Fences and Trees) Act 2011
93 See, eg,
Marsh v Baxter
[2015] WASCA 169
(3 September 2015).
3.108 In the Western Australian case of
Marsh v Baxter,
94 a farmer
who owned an organically certified farm claimed in nuisance against a
neighbouring farmer whose crops included genetically
modified (GM) canola. The
GM canola seeds blew onto the organic farm, which resulted in the loss of the
farm’s organic certification.95
3.109 Unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of land has been
described as resulting when substantial and unreasonable
‘annoyance, or
discomfort’ is caused.96 This is judged against the common law standard
of a ‘reasonable user’,
which requires that any minor or trifling
interference will be considered part of the ordinary neighbourly exchange of
and take, live and let live’.97
3.110 Trindade and Cane explain this as follows:
when people live in close proximity to one another they have to be prepared,
to some extent, to allow others to do things that annoy
them at times when they
would prefer to be left in peace and quiet if they, in turn, want to be able to
behave in a way that might
annoy their neighbours and at a time when their
neighbours would prefer they did not.98
3.111 Therefore, liability will only be imposed ‘where the harm or risk
to one is greater than
[what] one ought to be required to bear under the circumstances’.99
3.112 In order to determine this, the court will balance factors
• the character of the neighbourhood in which the interference
• the extent of the interference
• the sensitivity of the affected neighbour
• whether an intention to harm exists.100
3.113 The character of the neighbourhood in which the interference occurs is
relevant to determining the unreasonableness of the interference.
reasonably acceptable in one neighbourhood may not be in another. For example,
the emission of noise and smoke in an industrial
area may be considered an
expected characteristic of the area.101
3.114 However, even if a
of interference is reasonable in a
neighbourhood, nuisance can still be found if the interference causes annoyance,
inconvenience
or discomfort to an unreasonable degree.102
3.115 The degree or extent of the interference is determined by examining its
duration, frequency, timing and intensity.103 These
factors are weighed against
one another to determine whether or not the interference can be considered
unreasonable.
3.116 For example, an interference of low to moderate intensity may not be
unreasonable unless it occurs over an extended period of
time; equally, a
considerably intrusive interference even if over only a short period of time may
be unreasonable.104
95 Although, in this case, nuisance was not found on two grounds: (1) the
organic farm was unduly sensitive to de-certification and
(2) the mere presence
of GM canola seeds, which had not yet germinated and could be easily identified
and thus removed, did not amount
to interference that was unreasonable: ibid

are of benefit to the public or community where it is

3.117 Interference will not be considered unreasonable where the affected
neighbour, their land or their use of the land are unduly
sensitive to the
interference. Whether or not undue sensitivity exists is tested objectively by
examining the interference against
the ‘ordinary usages of humankind
living in a particular society’.105
3.118 An improper motive, or an intention to cause harm, may also be
relevant. Where the interference is carried out in order to annoy,
vex or harm,
nuisance may be established regardless of whether or not that interference is
otherwise unreasonable or the affected
neighbour is unduly sensitive.106
Unreasonable interference causing damage to property
3.119 The second type of unreasonable interference relates to damage to
3.120 In order to make out nuisance causing damage to property, actual
physical damage must have occurred. This may include physical
damage, such as a
crack in concrete foundations, or damage to a dwelling, fixture or chattels on
the land.107
3.121 In the Victorian case
City of Richmond v Scantelbury,
roots of elm trees encroached on neighbouring land and, in doing so, extracted
water and moisture from the subsoil. This
undermined the structure of the
affected neighbour’s property and caused
its concrete foundations to crack. The affected neighbour sued the tree owner
for nuisance109 and was awarded damages.110
3.122 A simple encroachment of a branch or root over boundary lines without
causing damage, or the mere potential of a tree to cause
damage to neighbouring
property will not be sufficient to make out nuisance.111
3.123 The presence of damage makes the interference unreasonable.112 The
relative weight of factors such as the characteristics
of the neighbourhood, the
extent of the interference, sensitivity and improper motive are not
relevant.113
3.124 Where damage has not yet occurred but there are concerns that it
may occur in the future, a court may grant relief, but
only in limited
circumstances. The damage must be imminent or likely to occur in the near
future, and be very substantial and almost
irreparable in nature.114
Tree owner must be liable
3.125 A tree owner will be liable for the nuisance caused by a tree if they
created, adopted or continued the nuisance.
3.126 In determining whether the tree owner has created, adopted or continued
the nuisance, a court would consider the relevant acts,
omissions and knowledge,
discussed below.

[2008] NSWLR 98
Creating a nuisance
3.127 A tree owner can create a nuisance in two ways: by deliberately or
recklessly causing the nuisance, or where they know it
is reasonably
foreseeable that their actions would cause a nuisance.115
3.128 A tree owner may plant a tree in a deliberate or reckless way by, for
example, planting a tree likely to cause interference
very close to a boundary
3.129 However, a tree owner can also create a nuisance by planting a tree
without deliberateness or recklessness. In these cases,
the tree owner will be
liable if they knew or ought to have known that it was reasonably foreseeable
that their planting of trees
would cause nuisance to their neighbour.116
3.130 This is particularly relevant where a tree is planted by third parties,
who are admitted onto the property and whose actions
are authorised by the tree
owner. Having control over who to allow onto a premises makes the tree owner
liable for any nuisance created
by the third party.117 For example, if a
contracted gardener plants a tree which causes nuisance
to the neighbour, the tree owner is liable for the nuisance as long as the
planting was
not outside the scope of what was instructed and the tree owner knew or ought
to have known of the risk of nuisance occurring.118
3.131 A tree owner may also be considered liable where their tenant
creates a nuisance if they authorised their tenant to plant
a tree that posed a
‘special risk of nuisance’,119 or if they knew that the probability
of the tree causing nuisance
was ‘highly likely’.120
3.132 If, however, the tree owner had no knowledge of the risk of nuisance,
it was not reasonable to expect them to know, or the tenant
or third party acted
without authorisation, then the tree owner is not liable.121 Instead, liability
attaches to the tenant or the
third party who created the nuisance.122
3.133 Liability continues as long as the interference remains.123
Adopting or continuing a nuisance
3.134 A person may buy or inherit property on which a tree causing nuisance
already exists, having grown naturally or been planted
by previous
3.135 The successive tree owner will be considered liable for nuisance where
they adopt or continue the nuisance after coming into
possession of the
3.136 A tree owner will have
the nuisance caused by the
tree where they make use of it. Similarly, the tree owner will be considered to
the nuisance where they fail to stop the nuisance being
caused by the tree within a reasonable time.125

3.137 As with the creation of a nuisance, the tree owner must have actual or
constructive knowledge of the interference.126 A tree
owner will not be held
liable for nuisance if they did not know of it or could not be expected to know
that it was likely.127 For
example, if a tree had shown no signs of decay or
structural damage, then its unforeseeable fall during a storm and resultant
of neighbouring property will not confer liability on the tree
3.138 Adopting or continuing a nuisance also requires the tree owner to be at
3.139 A tree owner will be at fault for adopting or continuing a nuisance
where they fail to take reasonable steps to end the
interference that is
reasonably foreseeable.129 Foreseeability is based on the real risk of the
interference occurring, not just
a theoretical risk.130
Reasonable steps
3.140 In order to determine whether the tree owner has failed to take
reasonable steps, the court will consider the precautions the
tree owner could
have taken, and did take, to mitigate or remove the interference.131 The court
will weigh the likely cost and inconvenience
of mitigating or removing the
interference against any damage or discomfort that the affected neighbour may
experience.132 Where
the cost or
inconvenience of taking precautions is prohibitive compared to the risk of
damage or discomfort occurring, liability will not be imposed.133
3.141 Liability begins when a tree owner gains actual knowledge of the
nuisance or when they ought to have known of the nuisance.134
3.142 Where a nuisance can be shown, a tree owner may still not be liable in
some circumstances, if they have a legal defence. Defences
to nuisance may be
available to tree owners where:
• they had statutory authority for their actions
• the nuisance was consented to
• the affected neighbour was contributorily negligent.
Statutory authority
3.143 Where an act is authorised by statute, it is not unlawful, even if it
causes a nuisance.135
This is because it is presumed that Parliament, in authorising activities
capable of causing nuisance, has already balanced within
the statute ‘the
rights of individuals against the benefit to the public of certain
nuisance-creating activities’.136
3.144 However, if it is found that the authorised act could have reasonably
been carried out without causing nuisance, then the defence
will no longer be
available.137

3.145 A tree owner may rely on the express or implied consent of an affected
neighbour as a defence. For example, if a tree causing
nuisance is maintained by
the tree owner for an agreed common benefit, such as providing shade, then the
affected neighbour may forego
any rights against the tree owner because of the
agreement reached.138
Contributory negligence
3.146 Where the person claiming nuisance has themselves contributed to the
nuisance, a defence of contributory negligence may be available
to the other
3.147 A finding of contributory negligence does not, however, fully defeat a
nuisance claim.
Instead, it reduces the tree owner’s liability where the affected
neighbour is found to have acted without reasonable care for
their own property,
contributing to the resulting damage for which they seek relief.140
3.148 For example, if the affected neighbour could have installed a root
barrier earlier in time instead of delaying its installation
by months and
allowing their property to undergo further damage from the encroaching roots,
then a court may find contributory negligence
on their part and, as a result,
reduce the tree owner’s liability.141
3.149 Any resulting damages awarded to the affected neighbour will be reduced
by an amount reflecting the extent of their contributory
negligence.142
Claims that cannot be relied on to defend nuisance
3.150 There are three established grounds on which nuisance cannot be
defended:143
• ‘Coming to’ a nuisance: those who acquire a property with
the knowledge that it is affected by a tree still retain
their right to enjoy
and use their land without unreasonable interference.144
• The affected neighbour’s use of land and foreseeability of
exposure to nuisance: the affected neighbour does not need
to take affirmative
steps, no matter how marginal, to change the way they would ordinarily use and
enjoy their land to minimise the
nuisance they experience.145
• Nuisance caused by multiple parties: to claim that the nuisance was
the cumulative result of many people’s actions is
no defence.146
3.151 An affected neighbour has several options for resolving a tree
dispute. As discussed above at [3.17] – [3.26], the
‘remedy’ of abatement is often exercised before an affected
neighbour pursues an action for nuisance in court.
3.152 Where the affected neighbour takes the matter to court, they may seek
an injunction or damages.

For example, an affected neighbour cannot be expected to stop parking their
car in their usual spot in order to mitigate the risk
of a branch falling and
damaging the car.
3.153 An injunction is a court order restraining the tree owner from
performing or continuing the interference.147 It is the main
remedy awarded to
an affected neighbour in an action for nuisance.148
3.154 An injunction may be prohibitive, in that it orders the tree owner to
stop certain actions;
or mandatory, in that it orders the tree owner to carry out a certain
3.155 Injunctions are an appropriate remedy for types of interference that
are recurrent, and where a monetary award of damages would
not provide relief
from the interference.150
They are also best suited for types of interference which infringe on the
affected neighbour’s right to use and enjoy their
land, as opposed to
causing damage to property.
3.156 For nuisance expected to occur in the future, an injunction151 may be
granted, even if the nuisance does not exist at the time
the injunction is
sought. The high threshold for this type of injunction requires ‘proof
that the apprehended damage ... is
imminent or likely to occur in the near
future and ... that the damage [will be] very substantial or almost
irreparable’.152
3.157 A court may make an award of damages to an affected neighbour, which is
monetary compensation for any material loss or damage
that has already occurred
as a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the nuisance.153
3.158 Damages are awarded in order to ‘put the injured parties back as
nearly as possible into the position in which they would
have been had the wrong
not been committed’. While
‘it is recognised that damages cannot return a plaintiff precisely to
the pre-tort position’, the award is nevertheless
‘calculated to
achieve this as far as money can’.154
3.159 Damage must be proven in order for an award to be made.155 This could
be material loss or damage to land, possessions, or for
the loss of profits
which would have otherwise been earned from use of the land.156
3.160 Damages cannot be awarded for a decrease in the value of the affected
neighbour’s property.157
3.161 Each new instance of loss or damage caused by a repeated nuisance gives
rise to a fresh claim for damages.158 This discourages
tree owners from
repeating the nuisance after compensating the affected neighbour for past
3.162 Damages can be awarded alone or in combination with an injunction.159
Where contributory negligence is found, damages will
be reduced by an amount
reflective of this.160
147 Ibid [21.270].
149 An injunction must clearly identify how it is to be complied with.
Injunctions must not be impossible to comply with and, if the
terms of the
injunction are not followed, its compliance must be able to be easily enforced:

and Francis Trindade,

(Oxford University Press, 5th ed, 2012) [5.1.7.1].
150 Interference that is temporary or on a one-off basis is more suited to
damages: see [3.157] – [3.163].

affected neighbour may also seek an injunction before the hearing (an
interlocutory injunction), but only if there
is a ‘serious question to be
tried’ and if it is appropriate on ‘the balance of
convenience’ to restrain
the tree owner in such a way before the hearing:

This decrease in value can, however, act as a measure of the seriousness of the
nuisance. This is because damages for nuisance seek
to provide relief for
infringement of the right to use and enjoyment of the land. The assessment of
this interference is based on
the level of discomfort or annoyance caused to the
person and is thus a subjective assessment.

3.163 Common law damages cannot be awarded for nuisance expected to occur in
the future.161 However, equitable damages, instead of
an injunction for future
nuisance,162 may be awarded in rare circumstances.163
3.164 Where a tree owner fails to exercise reasonable care in relation to
their tree, resulting in harm or loss to a neighbour, the
tree owner can be
found to have been negligent.164
3.165 Negligence occurs where the tree owner breaches the duty of care they
owe to the affected neighbour, causing the affected neighbour
to suffer a
reasonably foreseeable harm.165
3.166 Damages for negligence is therefore the most appropriate remedy to
past, one-off losses such as personal injury or damage to
property. An
injunction is usually ineffective in
these situations, as the risk of these events and losses recurring is likely
to be low.166 For example, where an old, decaying tree
falls and causes damage
to property or injury to a person on neighbouring land, it is unlikely that
this event will recur.167
3.167 In tree disputes where damage to property is concerned, negligence is
often submitted as an alternative cause of action to
nuisance.168 A matter may
succeed on one or the other,
or both causes of action.169
3.168 Where personal injury is alleged in a tree dispute, it is more likely
that negligence will be exclusively relied on.170
3.169 While negligence cases concerning trees and damage to property are
plentiful,171 negligence cases concerning personal injury
due to trees are
scarce. The Commission is unaware of any cases in the higher courts concerning
personal injury caused by trees.172
3.170 Although personal injury from trees is not frequently litigated,173
the Commission is aware that it is an issue of concern
in the community and
warrants exploration.174 Personal injury resulting from a tree was considered in
reviews of tree disputes in
other jurisdictions
and is frequently brought forward as a basis of a claim under the New South
Queensland statutory schemes.175

the fact that negligence is usually argued in the alternative to nuisance and
most of the court’s analysis
is concerned with the nuisance claim. See,

[2016] VCC 1656

[64] where Jordan J states of the negligence claim argued by the affected
neighbour in addition to nuisance, ‘In
view of what I have concluded as
to nuisance, it is not necessary to separately discuss the question of the tort
of negligence at
any length. But lest there is any doubt about the matter, I am
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the loss and damage
caused to the
plaintiff is as a result of breach of the duty of care owed to the plaintiff by
the defendant.’

3.171 Negligence claims must be brought before a court within three years
of the harm being discoverable (ie it is known about
or could be identified), or
within 12 years of the date the negligent act occurred, whichever occurs
first.176 For negligence resulting
to property, a person must bring legal action within six years of the date
the negligent act occurred.177
3.172 The requirements that must be established for a person’s actions
to be considered legally negligent, and the available
defences and remedies are
discussed below.
Establishing negligence
3.173 In order to establish negligence, the affected neighbour must prove all
of the following:
• that the tree owner owed them a duty of care
• that the tree owner breached that duty
• that the breach resulted in harm
• that the harm was not too remote from, but was a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of, the breach.178
Duty of care
3.174 In order for a person to be held liable for negligence, it must be
shown that they owed a duty of care to the person alleging
negligence.179
3.175 A person who owes a duty of care to another fulfils this duty by
adhering to a standard
of care that a ‘reasonable person of ordinary prudence’ would
adhere to in order to avoid
‘unreasonable risk or danger to others’.180
3.176 It is well established that neighbours owe each other this duty of
Breach of duty of care
3.177 The duty of care can be breached through a positive act or omission
that falls short of the standard of care that a reasonable
person of ordinary
prudence would adhere to.182
3.178 However, a person will not fall short of this standard of care, and
thus will not breach their duty of care, if they take precautions
to safeguard
against foreseeable risks that are
‘not insignificant’.183
3.179 The foreseeability of risks and whether or not a person has adequately
taken precautions against them will depend on factors
such as ‘the
probability of the risk occurring, the severity of the harm if it does, the cost
and difficulty of taking precautions
against the risk and the social utility of
the conduct that creates the risk’.’184
3.180 The balancing of these factors is commonly referred to in law as
‘the calculus of negligence’;185 the result of
which will depend on
the particular facts of each case.186

Courts have also

Cane, Mark Lunney and Francis Trindade,
The Law of Torts in Australia
University Press, 5th ed, 2012) ch 8.7.
3.181 The affected neighbour must then prove that the breach resulted in harm
3.182 Harm is also referred to as ‘injury’,
‘damage’ or ‘loss’ in case law.
Wrongs Act 1958
(Vic) defines harm broadly as ‘any kind of
harm’, which includes personal injury or death; and damage to property and
economic loss:187
• Damage to property includes damage caused to anything on the land,
including chattels/possessions.
• Personal injury refers to physical bodily injury.188
• Economic loss is an ‘injury to person or property resulting in
immediate or subsequent detriment to a person’s
wealth’.189
Causation and remoteness
3.183 The existence of a breach of duty (by the tree owner) that results in
harm caused (to the affected neighbour) does not prove
the tree owner’s
negligence.190 Instead, the affected neighbour must go on to prove that the
resulting harm was, in fact,
by the negligence of the tree owner, and that the consequences they suffer
are not too remote.191
3.184 To determine this, the court will use a two-step approach that involves
determining first, factual causation192 and secondly,
the scope of
liability.193
Factual causation
3.185 Factual causation is established where the negligent conduct ‘was
a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm’.194
3.186 This reflects the common law ‘but for’ test, which obliges
the court to ask whether the affected neighbour would
still have suffered their
loss if the tree owner had not been negligent.195
3.187 An affected neighbour may need to produce expert evidence, such as
reports by arborists or structural engineers, to prove factual
causation.196
3.188 Establishing this causal link can be difficult where there may be
multiple causes of the harm, such as where an affected neighbour
allergies from a neighbouring tree but also from other species of tree, or trees
on their own property.197
3.189 In order to assess factual causation in complex circumstances, the
courts will apply common law principles.198 In addition,
section 51(2)
directs the court
to consider, along with established principles for examining factual
causation, ‘whether or not and why responsibility for the
harm should be
imposed on the negligent party’.199

Scope of liability
3.190 The law provides that a finding of factual causation must consider
whether it is appropriate for the negligent person to be
held liable for the
harm suffered by the affected neighbour.200
3.191 For the courts, this involves finding a ‘policy-based balance
between the defendant’s wrongful conduct and the consequences
the defendant is to be liable’.201 This is set out in
section 51(4)
which directs the court to consider, among other things,
‘whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed
the negligent party’.202
3.192 The harm suffered will be considered the responsibility of the tree
owner where it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of
their negligent
conduct.203 There must be a real (not far-fetched) risk of the conduct causing
harm to the affected neighbour.204
has to be foreseeable is the type of harm caused, rather than its extent or
the manner in which it occurred.205
3.193 For example, if a healthy tree with no signs of decay or rot blows down
in gale-force winds and causes damage to property or
injury to a person, the
harm it causes is not likely to be considered reasonably foreseeable (that is,
there was no way for the tree
owner to predict this outcome).206 The law of
negligence is not concerned with ‘acts of God’ or where no known
ever existed.207
3.194 However, if it was obvious that the tree was full of rot and on the
verge of dying, or the tree owner knew that the tree posed
a risk of falling
down, then any resulting harm from it falling on neighbouring property would be
considered reasonably foreseeable,
even if the manner in which it fell or the
extent of the harm was unexpected.208
3.195 There are four defences available against claims of negligence. These
• contributory negligence
• voluntary assumption of risk
• illegality
• statutory defences.
Contributory negligence
3.196 Where the affected neighbour fails to take reasonable care for their
own safety, and
this failure contributes to their injury, the court may find contributory
negligence.209 This provides a partial defence resulting
in the award of damages
being reduced in proportion to the affected neighbour’s contribution to
their harm.210

Medical Liability’

unlike contributory negligence in a nuisance claim, liability for negligence can
also be fully defeated by contributory
negligence if the court thinks it just
and equitable to do so:

– [3.149]; unless otherwise expressly stated, the same principles
Voluntary assumption of risk
3.197 A negligence claim may be defeated where the tree owner can prove that
the affected neighbour fully comprehended the extent
of the risk and freely
chose to accept or ignore it, thus voluntarily assuming the risk.211
3.198 Whether or not the affected neighbour comprehended the extent of the
risk is a subjective assessment based on their actual knowledge.212
risk is obvious, the court will presume the affected neighbour was aware of the
Illegal activity
3.199 The fact that a person was engaged in an illegal activity at the time
they suffered harm does not necessarily provide an automatic
defence for the
negligent party.214
A duty of care may still be owed to a person engaged in an illegal activity
in certain circumstances.215
3.200 The court may also take into consideration whether or not the person
bringing the claim was engaged in illegal activity and
reduce an award of
damages to reflect this engagement.216
Statutory defences
3.201 Some defences are included in the
. These include the
statutory defences relating to ‘good samaritans’ and
volunteers.217
3.202 The main remedy for negligence is financial compensation (damages).
Damages are awarded for losses that can be proven in precise
monetary terms
(called special damages), and for losses that cannot be proven so precisely
including future financial218 and non-
financial losses (called general
damages).219

3.204 Trespass to land221 is unauthorised entry onto land.222 Legal action
can be taken against the person entering without authority.
3.205 Land relates not only to ‘the surface of any ground, soil or
earth but also any buildings or structures that might
be affixed to it ... both
things growing on the surface (such as trees and grass) and minerals under the
surface’.223
3.206 An action for trespass may be used by the tree owner for invasions of
land by the affected neighbour in two situations. First,
where the affected
neighbour abates (cuts back overhanging vegetation) beyond their boundary line
from their own land and onto the
tree owner’s land.224 Secondly, where the
affected neighbour physically enters the tree owner’s land without
permission.
3.207 Every invasion of land, no matter how minor, is considered a
trespass,225 even if the trespass does not cause any material
Establishing trespass
3.208 Trespass is established when the affected neighbour intentionally
causes direct physical intrusion onto the tree owner’s
3.209 The requirements for making out this cause of action are discussed
3.210 The affected neighbour must intend the trespass. An affected neighbour
will have intended the trespass if they ‘deliberately
and wilfully’
carried out any voluntary act, such as cutting down branches of a tree that have
not encroached onto their land.
3.211 The affected neighbour may be deemed to have intended trespass where it
is substantially certain that a particular action would
result in contact with
3.212 An affected neighbour who recklessly commits trespass will also be
regarded as having had the necessary intention.227
Direct physical intrusion
3.213 The most obvious form of direct physical intrusion which causes contact
with the land is entering the land without permission.
Direct physical intrusion
does not need to
be carried out by a person; it may occur when, for example, objects are
placed over boundary lines and left on the land, or poison
is deposited on the
tree owner’s soil.228 As Justice Bollen explained in the South Australian
Gazzard v Hutchesson,
229 trespass can be made out without
entering another’s land when an affected neighbour uses a stepladder to
lean over a boundary
line and cut their neighbour’s roses.
3.214 The encroachment of roots and branches over boundary lines will not
constitute a direct physical intrusion for the purposes
of trespass. An action
in nuisance would be better suited to these situations.230
221 A number of forms of trespass exist, including to land, property and to
the person. For the purposes of this paper, and unless
the context indicates
otherwise, all references to ‘trespass’ should be considered to mean
‘trespass to land’.

Possession of land
3.215 The tree owner must be in actual possession of the land. This means
that, where a property is being rented, only a tenant with
exclusive possession
can bring an action for trespass.231
3.216 A licensee (someone with permission to be on the land but without a
tenancy agreement)
may also be able to sue third parties for trespass in certain
circumstances.232
3.217 Trespass resulting from mistake, however reasonable, will not be a
defence.233
3.218 An affected neighbour may rely on the following defences against
trespass:234
• necessity (a belief that the trespass was reasonably necessary to
‘preserve life or protect property from real and imminent
• consent.236
3.219 A tree owner may seek an injunction or damages as a remedy for
trespass. These are discussed below.
3.220 A court order (injunction) restraining a person from continuing to
trespass, may be sought. For example, this may occur when
a person remains on
the land after entry and refuses to leave,237 places objects on the land and
refuses to remove them; or builds
a wall on the land. The trespass will continue
for as long as the intrusion remains.238
3.221 An injunction may also be sought against any threatened
trespass.239
3.222 Physical intrusion onto property, even without causing material damage
or harm, is enough to hold the intruder liable to pay
damages.240
3.223 However, for trespass where no damage results, the tree owner may be
awarded only a small (‘nominal’) amount of
damages.241
3.224 Exemplary or aggravated damages may be awarded where significant
disrespect is shown for the rights of the tree owner, and the
court considers
that punishment is warranted.242
For example, cutting down a neighbour’s tree when they are absent from
their land, without informing them or allowing them a
chance to have their say

4. Planning law and regulation
affecting trees on private land
Introduction
4.1 As discussed in Chapter 3, Victoria does not have a specific statutory
framework that regulates disputes between neighbours over
trees. Generally, an
affected neighbour must rely on the self-help remedy of abatement or the common
law torts of nuisance, negligence
and trespass.
4.2 Planning schemes and environmental and heritage laws may also be relevant
to a dispute.
These laws may prescribe that vegetation or individual trees are protected or
preserved on private land. They may require a landowner
to obtain a permit
before removing
or pruning vegetation. They may also authorise the removal of vegetation in
specific circumstances; for example, bushfire management
or to keep electricity
lines clear. Other laws may put a positive obligation on a landowner to remove
some types of vegetation, for
example, noxious weeds.
4.3 Landowners typically find out about planning laws affecting their land
through contact with their local council.
4.4 Planning schemes administered by local councils are the most common type
of regulation affecting trees on private land in Victoria.
The Victorian
planning system is complex and layered, and the Commission is not seeking to
review the system or its operation.
4.5 Instead, the purpose of this chapter is to give a brief overview of the
Victorian planning scheme, and to consider some of the
planning regulations that
may affect disputes between neighbours about trees. While many regulations only
apply in specific and limited
circumstances, they are relevant to some tree
owners. This chapter also canvasses the impact other laws may have on vegetation
private land.
4.6 Any reforms to the current dispute-resolution processes in Victoria would
need to consider the impact on existing tree protection
mechanisms and processes
contained in planning schemes and local laws.
The planning system in Victoria
Planning and Environment Act 1987
(Vic) (the Planning Act)
provides the legal framework for Victoria’s planning system. The Planning
Act does two key things:
it establishes the Victoria Planning Provisions (the
VPPs), and enables local councils to build their own planning schemes from those
standard provisions.1
1 Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning,
Victoria’s Planning System Guide (
28 May 2015) [1.2] <
www.planning.vic.
/planning-in-victoria /a-guide-to-the-planning-system>. See also Stephen
The Victorian Planning System: Practice, Problems
and Prospects
(The Federation Press, 4th ed, 2017) 23.
4.8 The VPPs are a comprehensive set of model planning provisions which
ensure consistent rules for planning matters across Victoria,
and consistency
across local council planning schemes. The VPPs are made up of standard
components2 that may be incorporated into
local planning schemes.
4.9 Each municipality in Victoria is covered by a local planning
scheme.3 A planning scheme generally applies to all private
and public land in
Victoria and is binding on all members of the public, on every Victorian
minister, government department, public
authority and council, unless exempted
under the Planning Act.4
4.10 The purpose of local planning schemes is to:
• provide a clear and consistent framework within which decisions about
the use and development of land can be made
• express state, regional, local and community expectations for areas
and land uses
• provide for the implementation of state, regional and local policies
affecting land use and development.5
4.11 Local planning schemes can identify and offer protection to significant
or important vegetation on public and private land. If
someone complains about
vegetation on a neighbouring property, planning regulations may protect that
vegetation or limit the action
a tree owner can take to address their
neighbour’s concerns. Planning regulations may also specify the process
involved and
documents needed to obtain a permit to prune or remove protected
vegetation.
4.12 Local planning schemes may also include provisions that are relevant to
or give effect to [the Council’s] Municipal Strategic
Statement and local
planning policies. 6 These provisions will include the relevant state standard
zones and overlays.7 Some of
these zones and overlays have local content added
to them as schedules, which ‘can be used to supplement and fine-tune the
basic provisions of a state-standard clause, zone or overlay in a planning
scheme, adapting it to local circumstances and locally-defined
objectives’.8
4.13 The next section gives a brief overview of the some of the key
components of the Victorian planning system. It also provides
examples of local
content that has been added to planning schemes by some councils.
4.14 These examples are not necessarily typical of all local government
areas. The focus is on councils that manage vegetation closely,
‘Green Wedge’ councils or councils in areas of significant
ecological diversity, as well as aspects of planning
schemes that are most
likely to affect parties’ rights in a tree dispute.

Standard Victorian zones
4.15 The VPPs currently list 30 distinct zones that are arranged into six
categories—residential, industrial, commercial, rural,
public land and
special purpose.9 The way private land is zoned may impact on landowners’
rights to control vegetation on their
property and specify the process and
permits involved.
4.16 Some zones will have more controls relating to trees and vegetation than
others. For example, the Rural Conservation Zone provides
tighter restrictions
on use of land and is designed to protect and enhance the natural environment
for its historic, archaeological,
scientific, landscape, faunal habitat and
cultural values.10
4.17 One example of a decision-making guideline in this zone prioritises the
retention of vegetation when developing land.11 Zones
must also be read
alongside any schedule that applies. For example, in the City of Stonnington, a
schedule to the General Residential
Zone specifies that for the construction or
extension of a single dwelling on a lot, a canopy tree is to be planted and that
planning application must detail any vegetation proposed to be removed or
Standard Victorian overlays
4.18 The main tools in the VPPs to protect vegetation in urban
environments are overlays.13 An overlay may require a tree owner
vegetation that is the subject of a dispute with a neighbour or require them to
obtain a permit to prune or remove it.
An overlay may
also specify the process required and documents needed to obtain a
4.19 Standard overlays for Victoria are included in the VPPs. As with zones,
many overlays have schedules to specify local objectives
and requirements.
4.20 There are 24 overlays listed in the VPPs. They are organised into broad
categories, including environmental and landscape, heritage
and built form, and
land management.14
4.21 An overlay differs from a zone because it considers the practical
constraints that apply to a particular site, whereas a zone
control is directed
at the central purpose of the land.15
Generally, an overlay applies to a ‘single issue or related set of
issues (such as heritage,
an environmental concern or flooding)’.16 Multiple overlays can be
used if more than one issue applies to land.
4.22 The overlays most likely to be relevant to neighbourhood tree disputes
• the Vegetation Protection Overlay
• the Environmental Significance Overlay
• the Significant Landscape Overlay
• the Heritage Overlay
• the Neighbourhood Character Overlay
• the Bushfire Management Overlay.

4.23 These are considered below more closely, along with examples of the way
some councils have added local content to them.17 The
examples concern Nillumbik
and East Gippsland Shire Councils. These municipalities provide some examples of
environmental overlay
controls applying to vegetation on private land.
4.24 Nillumbik Shire Council is a local government area on Melbourne’s
north-east fringe.
It contains outer northern suburbs of Melbourne and rural localities beyond
the urban area. It is known as a Green Wedge Shire.18
This Green Wedge area has
agricultural and recreational uses and other functions that support Melbourne.
It also has areas of ‘strong
environmental, landscape, built and Koori
heritage value for Victorians—many of which are of state, national or
international
significance’.19 The Nillumbik Green Wedge covers
91 per cent of the total shire area, and is zoned rural. Seventy-nine per
cent of Nillumbik Green Wedge land is in private ownership
and around 43 per
cent of that land has environmental significance.20 This Shire has numerous
environmental overlays that apply
to private property in the municipality and other planning controls which
trigger the need to obtain a planning permit to clear vegetation
4.25 The East Gippsland Shire Council covers the second largest local
government area in Victoria and includes extensive coastline,
a major lake and
river system, high country, national parks and state forest.21 The shire has a
high biodiversity of species and
ecosystems, and is home to ‘many species
of plants and animals which are absent
from, or rare in, the rest of Victoria’.22 The region has significant
areas of original native vegetation. Planning regulations
in this Shire also
trigger the need to obtain a planning permit to clear vegetation on private land
in some circumstances.
Vegetation Protection Overlay
4.26 The Vegetation Protection Overlay 23 focuses on the protection of
significant vegetation, including native and introduced vegetation
in urban and
rural environments.24
4.27 The overlay can be applied to individual trees, groups of trees or areas
of significant vegetation.25 It requires a landowner
to obtain a permit to
remove, destroy or lop any vegetation specified in a schedule to the overlay
subject to a list of exemptions.26
Some of those exemptions apply to particular
situations, for example, to clear vegetation from electricity lines and to
ensure emergency access.27
4.28 The East Gippsland Shire Council has eight local schedules to the
Vegetation Protection Overlay which outline the nature and
significance of the
vegetation to be protected and the vegetation protection objective, as well as
permit requirements and decision-making
guidelines.28
17 Other land management overlays not discussed may also limit the removal of
vegetation, eg, erosion, salinity or flood overlays:

4.29 For example, Schedule 8 is the Mallacoota Vegetation Protection Area
Overlay. It seeks to protect vegetation of high conservation
vegetation with high aesthetic and landscape value within built-up areas around
the township of Mallacoota. Some remnant
native vegetation in this area provides
habitat for vulnerable rare or threatened species and some vegetation is rare or
on a state or national basis.29 For those living
in this area, the schedule provides some exemptions to the need to obtain a
permit, including pruning of garden vegetation in the
course of regular
maintenance, provided this does not significantly affect the extent or nature of
vegetation on a lot.30
Environmental Significance Overlay
4.30 This overlay is applied if vegetation protection ‘is part of a
wider objective to protect the environmental significance
of the area’. 31
It is broader than the Vegetation Protection Overlay because it can also
contain requirements about building
and fence construction.32
A permit is required under this overlay to remove, destroy or lop any
vegetation, including dead vegetation, unless there is an exemption
overlay or any schedule.33
4.31 The Nillumbik Shire Council has added three separate local schedules to
the Environmental Significance Overlay, one of which
is the Faunal and Habitat
Significance Schedule.34 It is designed to protect and enhance significant
faunal and habitat sites and
to allow fauna
to move between different areas. There are ‘specific sites on both
public and private land that have been identified as being
of particular
importance’.35
4.32 The Shire requires that any application for the removal of vegetation
include detailed information about the number and size
of any trees to be
removed or pruned, as well as information about the reason for removal and steps
taken to avoid that removal and
any offsetting arrangements. An arborist’s
report is also required in some circumstances.36
4.33 The Shire notes the impact that vegetation removal may have on
neighbours. It suggests that neighbours are sometimes unaware
of approved
removal of vegetation, and therefore recommends that residents:
advise any nearby neighbours of [their] intention to remove the vegetation
and that [they] have obtained permission to do so before
[they] proceed to
remove the vegetation. Failure to do so may result in Council officers being
obliged to visit [their] land, and
also potentially delay the vegetation
Significant Landscape Overlay
4.34 This overlay exists to conserve and enhance the character of significant
landscapes.38
It mainly applies when vegetation is aesthetically or visually important in
the broader landscape and vegetation is identified as
an ‘important
contributor to the character of
an area’.39 A permit is required to remove, destroy or lop vegetation
unless an exemption applies.40

under 52.16.
4.35 The Nillumbik Shire Council has seven schedules to the Significant
Landscape Overlay,41 meaning that ‘the planning controls
and desired
landscape outcomes of the overlay vary from neighbourhood to
neighbourhood’.42
4.36 For example, in the designated ‘Garden Court’ area,
described as a residential development set within predominantly
vegetation, a permit is required to remove, destroy or lop any
‘substantial tree’.43
4.37 The Shire’s Neighbourhood Character Policy (to be read in
conjunction with the overlays)
specifically outlines the existing and preferred character of each
neighbourhood precinct covered by the Significant Landscape Overlay.44
policy aims to ensure that development respects local community and
environmental values, and maintains and enhances the character
of urban and
township areas. A design objective of this policy is to maintain the existing
vegetation including canopy trees. 45
4.38 Where the need for a planning permit is triggered by an overlay
requirement and a resident wishes to remove only one or two trees
or to prune
trees and no development is involved, the Nillumbik Shire Council allows
residents to lodge a ‘fast track’
application.46
Otherwise, the standard application for planning permit must be used.47
4.39 A council arborist will inspect the tree/s, and will then provide a
recommendation to the Shire planning team so Council can
determine the
application. A condition of approval may include a requirement for the
replanting of trees to compensate for the approved
removal of trees.48
Heritage Overlay
4.40 The Heritage Overlay may protect specific individual trees or groups of
trees on private land (such as a landmark tree or an
Avenue of Honour).49 A
heritage overlay aims to conserve and enhance heritage places50 of natural or
cultural significance and to
ensure that development does not adversely affect
the significance of heritage places.51
4.41 The overlay includes a statement outlining what is valuable about a
place or object, and this is often supplemented by local
policy.52 A permit is
required to remove, destroy or lop a tree if a schedule identifies tree
controls for a heritage place.53
4.42 These tree controls are not intended to protect trees for their amenity
value, but to protect trees that are ‘of intrinsic
significance (such as
trees that are included on the National Trust Register or trees that contribute
to the significance of a heritage

4.43 One of the decision-making guidelines to be considered in granting a
permit is whether the lopping or development will adversely
affect the health,
appearance or significance of the tree.55
4.44 One criterion used for the assessment of heritage values is a strong or
special association with a particular community or cultural
group for social,
cultural or spiritual reasons. This includes the significance of a place to
Aboriginal people as part of their
continuing and developing cultural
traditions.56
Neighbourhood Character Overlay
4.45 The Neighbourhood Character Overlay identifies areas of existing or
preferred neighbourhood character and aims to ensure that
development respects
that character.57
Vegetation removal may be controlled by this overlay. If trees are specified
in a schedule, a permit is usually required to remove,
destroy or lop them.58
The overlay only protects large trees over a certain height or girth.59 The
overlay lists factors relevant
to decision making, including the contribution
that the tree makes to the neighbourhood character and the health of the
Bushfire Management Overlay
4.46 The Bushfire Management Overlay61 specifies planning requirements for
bushfire protection and developmental controls to ‘mitigate
risk to life,
property and community infrastructure’.62 One of its purposes is to
identify areas where bushfire hazards warrant
bushfire protection measures being
implemented. Consequently, this overlay may provide exemptions where a permit
would otherwise
be required to remove certain vegetation.63
Particular provisions
4.47 Particular provisions are statewide specific planning provisions that
apply to particular issues or application types. They apply
in addition to a
zone or an overlay unless specified otherwise. Some particular provisions have
schedules for local requirements.64
4.48 The particular provisions relating to native vegetation and bushfire
protection exemptions are potentially relevant to private
tree owners’
management of their trees. These provisions may require a landowner to obtain a
permit to remove or prune protected
native vegetation on large blocks of land.
They may also excuse a landowner from having to obtain a permit required
elsewhere in
a planning scheme, in an overlay, for example, for bushfire safety

Native vegetation particular provisions
4.49 Native vegetation is defined in the VPPs as ‘plants that are
indigenous to Victoria, including trees, shrubs, herbs and
grasses’.65
4.50 The native vegetation particular provisions of the VPPs control the
removal of native vegetation. A permit is usually required
to remove, destroy
or lop native vegetation,66 subject to some limited exemptions.67 The provisions
also establish offset requirements
to compensate for removal, with the aim of
ensuring that clearing native vegetation has a neutral impact on
Victoria’s biodiversity.
The type of offset required depends on the
characteristics of the native vegetation being removed, and the extent of the
4.51 The native vegetation particular provisions will not affect most private
properties in Victoria. They ‘aim to prevent broad-scale
clearing of
vegetation and will have limited applicability in urban areas with small lot
sizes’.69 They are more relevant
areas or Green Wedge areas because this is where most native vegetation is
located and because of the way the VPP defines native vegetation
and the way the
exemptions are framed.
4.52 If the native vegetation provisions apply to private property, the
provisions allow the clearing of some vegetation without a
permit. Some of the
exemptions include: lopping and pruning for maintenance to a maximum of
one-third of the foliage from an individual
plant; where the vegetation has been
planted, for example, in a garden or as a street tree; or to enable the removal
or destruction
of a listed weed in certain circumstances.70 The permit
requirements will not apply to vegetation on small blocks.71
4.53 Planning schemes also consider the non-biodiversity impacts of native
vegetation removal, for example, for managing bushfire
risk, Aboriginal cultural
heritage, timber harvesting, minimising land and water degradation, and
preserving landscape values.72
Bushfire protection particular provisions
4.54 The bushfire protection particular provisions were added following the
recommendations of the 2009 Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission.73
They provide
additional exemptions to the need to obtain a native vegetation clearing permit,
and they also apply to non-native
vegetation. They allow for the clearance of
some vegetation around existing buildings, used for accommodation and adjacent
on property boundaries, to reduce fuel load.74

planning decision
to be made about the removal, destruction or lopping of only one tree.83 The
application must provide a range of information, including
the species and size
of the tree and any other significant trees removed in the past three years on
the site. It must also explain
why works need to be conducted and include a
photograph of the tree. The decision-making guidelines include consideration of
objectives of any applicable overlay, whether

administer and enforce the planning scheme, generally the local
4.63 A Planning Authority is the person or organisation authorised to prepare
a planning scheme or an amendment; the default Planning
Authority is the local
council in a municipal district. However, the council will need approval from
the Minister to change a scheme.87
4.64 Decisions can be made at the state and local level, depending on the
nature of the proposal. Generally, local councils control
the day-to-day
administration of Victoria’s planning system, and each must also keep an
up-to-date copy of the VPPs and its
planning scheme available for inspection
during office hours, free of charge.88
Non-compliance and enforcement
4.65 Any person who uses or develops land in contravention of, or fails to
comply with, a planning scheme, a planning permit, or an
agreement with the
owner of land under section 173 of the Planning Act, is guilty of an offence.89
There are a range of
enforcement options available to a Responsible Authority, including
negotiation, warnings, infringement notices, injunctions and prosecution.90
4.66 A recent Nillumbik Shire Council prosecution for an illegal tree removal
under the Planning Act resulted in a fine of $30,000.
The Council noted that
‘removing significant trees is something that this Council takes very
seriously and the message is clear—if
[residents] remove trees without a
permit we will take action’.91
The role of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal
4.67 Applications can be made to the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT) to independently review planning decisions
made by a Responsible

including applications to
cancel permits and applications for enforcement

hearing of disputes.94
The role of arborists in planning schemes
4.69 Councils often rely on arborists to assist them to manage vegetation in
local government areas. Some councils employ in-house
arborists and others
engage contractor arborists. The bulk of work done by arborists is in relation
to council trees.

4.70 As well as carrying out works and assessments of trees for councils,95
arborists may also assist councils with ensuring that
proposed work on trees
aligns with planning principles. Their work may include:
• providing reports for planning applications that involve the removal
of vegetation
(residential or commercial)
• reviewing submissions to prune or remove private protected trees and
carrying out that work or inspecting it96
• determining the boundaries of tree protection zones97
• approving Tree Protection Management Plans
• conducting risk assessments for trees that may pose a danger to
people or property and removing unsafe trees or branches98
• surveying and making an inventory of the trees on a given site.
Local tree protection laws
4.71 Some councils have local laws to protect trees on private and public
land.99 Councils sometimes introduce these laws as an added
protection mechanism
where trees are important to the character of the district or are otherwise
significant. These laws supplement
planning regulations. If a tree is protected,
these laws may limit the action
a landowner can take to resolve a dispute with their neighbour (namely
abatement) and may require a particular process to be followed
before work can
be done to that tree.
4.72 Where they exist, local laws generally contain similar tree protections,
operating to:
• protect trees identified as ‘significant’ or
‘protected’ on private land
• extend protection by reference to trees’ large size, age,
rarity, ecological value, or cultural and historical significance
• extend protections to a root zone around the base of the tree and/or
a tree protection zone around the trunk of the tree
• require the owner to obtain a permit to prune or remove protected
trees or to carry out works in proximity to the tree protection
4.73 The operation of local tree protection laws can be understood through
the following examples from the Cities of Boroondara, Port
Phillip and
95 This includes providing guidance on the planting and maintenance of trees,
treating tree diseases or pests, managing roots and
providing long-term tree
care plans. For a more detailed discussion of the role of arborists (in the
context of private disputes),
see [3.41] – [3.48].
96 In the City of Port Phillip, an application for the private pruning or
removal of identified ‘significant’ trees requires
the submission of
an arborist’s report at the applicant’s own initiative and expense.
This report is then reviewed by
the Council’s own arborist: City of Port

99 Local laws are those made by local governments under the
Government Act 1989
(Vic). Under the Act a local law must not be
inconsistent with any other Act or regulation (state or federal): s
111. Local laws are therefore aimed at dealing with local issues.
City of Boroondara
4.74 The City of Boroondara is in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and
includes established, leafy suburbs, some alongside the Yarra
River.100 The
City of Boroondara Tree Protection Law 2016 protects canopy trees and
significant trees in the municipal district
on private property.101 In outlining
the context of the new laws, the Council acknowledged the environmental benefits
of trees in
the suburban environment and the contribution the local tree canopy
‘makes to the quality of its suburban environment. Damage
and or removal
of Significant Trees or Canopy Trees results in a degradation of this
established character.’102
4.75 Three key principles are identified by the City of Boroondara:
• Significant trees must be retained and cared for and will be the
major determining factor in any redevelopment of land in
the vicinity of the
• Trees that contribute to the municipal district’s overall tree
canopy character should
be retained where practicable. Works near significant trees or canopy trees
should be minimised to prevent damage and disruption to
tree roots or growing
conditions.
• Owners of land and/or contractors will be responsible for the loss or
damage of significant trees or canopy trees that are
required to be
retained.103
4.76 Local law prohibits a range of activities in relation to significant
trees and canopy trees including removing, pruning and damaging
the tree and
carrying out works in a tree protection zone or a structural root zone.104 They
apply whether or not the tree extends
beyond the boundary of private land but do
not apply to a tree or part of a tree that is on public land.105
4.77 In deciding whether to grant a permit to allow those activities, the
Council or authorised officer must consider:
• the effect of the proposed action on the aesthetics of the
neighbourhood
• whether the tree is a significant tree
• the condition of the tree
• the appropriateness of the tree for its location on the property,
having regard to the existing buildings and conditions on
the property
• whether the proposed action is to be undertaken for reasons of health
• whether the tree is causing any unreasonable property damage
• whether the tree is causing any unreasonable public nuisance or
creating any unreasonable nuisance to private property owners
or occupiers
• whether the tree is a recognised weed
• the nature of the zoning of the land under the City of Boroondara
Planning Scheme
• any legislative requirements
• any other matter relevant to the circumstances associated with the
application.106
100 It includes the suburbs of Ashburton, Balwyn, Balwyn North, Burwood,
Camberwell, Canterbury, Deepdene, Glen Iris, Glenferrie South,
Hawthorn, Hawthorn East, Kew, Kew East, Mont Albert and Surrey Hills:

Protections also apply to trees on public land. The City of Boroondara notes
a significant tree is protected because of its impressive size or age,
rarity, ecological value, or cultural and historical significance.
A canopy tree
contributes to the municipality’s biodiversity, shade and privacy.

106 Ibid s 12.
4.78 A qualified arborist visits and inspects the tree and provides a report
to council.107 If granted, permits are valid for 12 months
and can be issued for
longer if needed. Special conditions may be attached to the permit, including
requirements to replace trees
that have been removed, conduct remediation works
to existing trees, and to protect trees close to building works.108
4.79 The provisions also set up a security bond scheme where an authorised
officer or council can ask that the owner of private land
proposing to do works
within protected zones
pay a security bond to the council. This bond may be retained to pay for
replacement vegetation or refunded at the discretion of the
council.109
4.80 If a tree or a part of a tree is interfered with contrary to the tree
protection law, the owner of the private land that the
tree is situated on is
guilty of an offence.110 This applies whether or not the person who actually
interfered with the tree is identified
or prosecuted, unless the owner can prove
that the interference occurred without their knowledge.111
4.81 An authorised officer may direct a private landowner or anyone engaged
to work on private land who appears to be in breach of
this local law to remedy
the situation. The officer may also direct someone in breach of these provisions
to plant by way of replacement
of one or more trees.112
4.82 Other protections that are provided in the local laws include the
cancellation of a permit, inspections and infringement notices
as an alternative
to prosecution for the offence.113
4.83 The Council also carries out follow-up inspections to make sure permit
conditions are being met. If a condition is breached,
Council may issue a fine,
send a ‘notice to comply’ or prosecute.114
City of Frankston
4.84 The City of Frankston is located on the eastern side of Port Phillip
Bay, approximately
40 kilometres south of Melbourne. The municipality covers an area of about
131 square kilometres from Seaford Wetlands in the north,
to Mount Eliza in the
south, and the Western Port Highway in the east. The western boundary of the
city is made up of about
10 kilometres of coastline.
4.85 Under Tree Protection Local Law 2016 No 22, trees with a trunk
circumference of over
100 centimetres may not be removed, otherwise killed, or pruned (more than
one third of the canopy) without a permit from the council.115
The stated aims
of the Tree Protection Law include to:
• protect [the] community forest by maintaining tree canopy on private
• require a minimum standard of tree pruning for the protection of
trees and public safety
• protect and enhance the amenity and environment of Frankston.116

City of Port Phillip
4.86 The City of Port Phillip117 is an inner-city bayside local government
area of Melbourne. It has tree protection laws that protect
palms and other
significant trees.118
4.87 A significant tree permit is generally required in addition to any
planning permit required under the Port Phillip planning
scheme. The Council has
some exclusions to its permit requirement. For example, a permit is not required
to prune a significant tree
where the tree overhangs a footpath or other part of
the road used by pedestrians,119 or extends over a road to create a danger
obscure or block vehicles, lighting or council assets.120
4.88 The Council encourages people relying on these exemptions to keep
photographic evidence of the tree before conducting any work.121
Other laws relevant to vegetation management
4.89 Other pieces of legislation supplement the core planning framework in
the Planning and Environment Act.122 While planning schemes
and local laws are
most likely to prescribe what can and cannot be done on most private property in
Victoria, other laws may also
be relevant, particularly outside metropolitan
4.90 Although less likely to apply to neighbourhood disputes, these laws
potentially impact on disputes between neighbours about trees.
They can oblige a
landowner to remove vegetation, for example, a noxious weed or vegetation that
is dangerous to road users. They
may also require a landowner to protect
important vegetation. Some of these laws are considered below and deal with
issues of public
health and land protection, environmental protections,
transport and road reserves, and heritage and cultural protections.
Public health and land protection
4.91 Private landowners with trees that adversely affect public health and
wellbeing, or the land of another owner, may be required
to take certain actions
Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008
(Vic) and the
and Land Protection Act
Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008
4.92 Under the
Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008
(Vic), councils
are required to remedy nuisances within the municipality, insofar as
possible.123 To be considered a nuisance under
this Act, an act or phenomenon
must be ‘dangerous to health or offensive’.124
4.93 If notified of a potential nuisance, the Council is obliged to
investigate it.125 If a nuisance
is found to exist, Council must take action it considers appropriate,126
including issuing an improvement or prohibition notice or
bringing proceedings
under the Act for the offence of creating a nuisance.127
4.94 The relevant part of the Act applies in particular to nuisances arising
from or constituted by any: ‘premises ... state,
condition or activity ...
or other matter or thing’, and could theoretically be applied to private
tree disputes.128

In determining this, Council may not consider
the number of people affected, but may consider degree of offensiveness:
(3)(a) – (b).
4.95 However, if the council is satisfied that the matter is better settled
privately, it must advise the complainant of any available
methods for doing
4.96 In practice, these provisions are designed to address nuisances posing
extreme public health risks. Councils are therefore unlikely
to become involved
in private tree disputes through this mechanism. The provision of information on
council websites about how to
resolve private tree disputes, and referrals from
council officers to DSCV and other resources, would satisfy the Act’s
requirements.
Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994
4.97 Landowners have responsibilities to manage specific weeds on their
properties.130 The
Catchment and Land Protection Act
Catchment Act) defines noxious weeds,131 and is Victoria’s primary
legislation dealing with invasive plants and
animals, although local laws may
also apply.
4.98 Under the Catchment Act, landowners must take all reasonable steps to
eradicate regionally prohibited weeds and prevent the growth
and spread of
regionally controlled weeds on and from their land.132
4.99 If required steps are not taken, the government may serve a notice on a
landowner outlining measures that must be taken to control
noxious species on
their land.133 Not complying with the conditions is an offence.134
Environmental protections
4.100 Private landowners may need to obtain a permit under the
Fauna Guarantee Act
(Vic) or the
Commonwealth
Environment Protection
and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
(Cth) to remove native
vegetation.135
Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988
4.101 The Flora and Fauna Act aims to conserve threatened native plants or
communities of native plants and manage processes that
are potentially
threatening to them.136 The permit requirements under the Act mainly apply to
public land because of the significant
exceptions for private landowners.137
However, the exceptions that apply to private land do not extend to taking flora
that forms part of a critical habitat138 or taking tree-ferns,
grasstrees or sphagnum for the purpose of sale.139

Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
4.103 The Act affects any group or individual whose actions may have a
‘significant impact’ on a matter of National Environmental
Significance,141 including landowners.142 If the proposed action meets this
test, it is a ‘controlled action’ and must
be referred to the
Commonwealth Department of Environment and Energy for assessment and
approval.143
4.104 If a private landowner wishes to clear native vegetation on their
property which is listed
as a threatened species, the requirements of this legislation will only apply
if the clearance satisfies the significant impact test.
While it is unlikely
that the removal of one or two native trees on a suburban block would meet this
test, it might apply on a larger
property outside metropolitan Melbourne.

Heritage and cultural protections
4.106 Heritage protections can apply to natural environments. The Victorian
Heritage Register covers places of state significance.
Commonwealth law applies
to places of national significance, and a separate scheme protects Aboriginal
heritage.147 As discussed
above at [4.40] – [4.44], protections are also
provided in the VPPs and planning schemes. Examples of relevant heritage laws
Heritage Act 1995
(Vic) —establishes the Victorian
Heritage Register. It covers non- Indigenous heritage places of state or
national significance.
A ‘place’ is defined under the Act as
including a building, a garden, a tree, a precinct, a site and land associated
with any of those.148
Aboriginal Heritage Act
(Vic) — establishes the
Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council and the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage
Register, which records
known Aboriginal heritage places and objects in
Victoria, such as scarred trees.149
141 The Act focuses on the protection of nine matters of National
Environmental Significance, which are: world heritage properties;
heritage places; wetlands of international importance; listed threatened species
and ecological communities; migratory species
protected under international
agreements; Commonwealth marine areas; the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;
protection from nuclear
actions (including uranium mines); protection of water
resources from coal seam gas development and large coal mining development:

Tree protection laws in other jurisdictions
4.107 New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania adopt
approaches similar to Victoria, where tree protections are
incorporated mainly
into local planning instruments—planning schemes, overlays or tree
protection orders.152 In these states,
‘tree protection criteria can vary
significantly from local council to council’.153
4.108 In South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, protections
for native and non- native vegetation on private land are
provided for in
state-based development control legislation.154 These laws adopt a similar
approach to that of the local tree protection
laws discussed above at [4.71]
4.109 The Commission is not reviewing the planning system, and is not able to
recommend changes to planning law in this project. However,
any changes to the
current dispute resolution system in Victoria would need to take into account
the impact on the planning scheme
and other existing laws relating to the
management of trees on private land.
4.110 Many of these laws and planning principles in this chapter apply only
in very specific circumstances. Although they are unlikely
to affect a large
number of disputes between neighbours over trees on private property, they may
place significant restrictions on
some tree owners.

Approaches to tree
disputes in other jurisdictions
68 Introduction
68 Australian jurisdictions
77 International jurisdictions
5. Approaches to tree disputes in other
Introduction
5.1 Although the nature of tree disputes is largely similar across Australia,
there is a range of approaches to their resolution.
5.2 Australian jurisdictions can be divided into those which have enacted
legislative regimes to govern the resolution of tree disputes,
and those which
have retained the common law.
5.3 As outlined in Chapter 1, reviews in New South Wales, Queensland and
Tasmania have been the basis for significant change. In these
there are now statutory schemes that set out the rights and responsibilities of
neighbours involved in a tree dispute,
as well as the specific causes of action
parties can rely on if they bring legal action. These schemes are analysed in
more detail,
and in the context of a possible Victorian scheme, in Chapter
5.4 International jurisdictions can also largely be separated into those that
retain the common law, and those that have enacted specialist
legislation in
5.5 In researching international models, the Commission has looked primarily
at those countries and sub-national entities that have
a similar political and
cultural context to Australia.
5.6 Those jurisdictions with important similarities or relevant differences
are discussed below.1
Australian jurisdictions
5.7 In the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, South
Australia and Western Australia, tree disputes are governed
by common law, as is
the case in Victoria. The overall process in each of these states and
territories is similar to the Victorian
process, in relation to disputes between
individuals.2
5.8 When local councils are involved (for example, where a tree on private
land causes nuisance or poses a risk of injury to people
using adjacent public
land, such as footpaths or roads) they may be able to order the tree owner to
remove the tree or maintain it
a certain way.3
1 Many jurisdictions’ statutory processes also deal with obstruction of
sunlight and views, including New South Wales, Queensland
Tasmania. This is outside of the terms of reference for this project, and
will not be covered.
2 See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the process in Victoria.
3 Eg, in the Northern Territory, a local council may order the removal or
trimming of a tree growing on private land if it is ‘causing
inconvenience
or an obstruction to persons using a public street or footpath or is causing or
likely to cause damage to an adjacent
public place’: City of Darwin,
Darwin City Council By-Laws
(26 June 2009) s 95
<https://legislation.nt.gov.au /en / Legislation / DARWIN-CITY-
COUNCIL-BYLAWS>.
5.9 Some councils may also have power to order a tree owner to remove
or maintain a tree if it affects a neighbour on private
land. For example, in
the Shire of Mundaring in Western Australia, if a tree is deemed to be
‘potentially dangerous to life
or limb, or a property
on adjoining land’ the Shire will contact the tree owner and ask that
‘they either make the tree safe or prove it is not
dangerous (via a report
from a qualified and experienced arboricultural consultant)’.4 If this is
not done, the Shire may
start a formal process to compel the tree owner
‘to make safe any potential danger caused by a tree or any part of the
5.10 Similarly, in South Australia, local councils have power to order tree
owners to remove or perform certain works on a tree where
it is ‘likely to
create danger or difficulty to persons using a public place or is unsightly and
detracts from the amenity
of the local area’. According to the Legal
Services Commission of South Australia, an affected neighbour may also contact
local council to ask that such action be taken against a tree owner if it
affects their land. However, some of these requests are
unlikely to be
progressed because some councils in South Australia have indicated that they
will avoid involvement in neighbour disputes
where possible.6
5.11 As is the case in Victoria, each of the states and territories has its
own provider of free mediation services.7
5.12 Where a party brings legal action in these jurisdictions, smaller claims
are heard in the Local Court in the Northern Territory
Magistrates’ Courts in South Australia and Western Australia.8
5.13 In the Australian Capital Territory, an affected neighbour can bring
legal action for nuisance in the ACT Civil and Administrative
Tribunal instead
of going to court, if their claim is under $25,000.9 Claims exceeding this
amount must be brought in the ACT Magistrates
New South Wales
5.14 In New South Wales, tree disputes can be heard in the New South Wales
Land and Environment Court (NSWLEC) under the
Trees (Disputes Between
Neighbours) Act 2006
(NSW) (the NSW Act). Key features of the statutory
scheme in New South Wales are discussed in more detail below, and under Option
in Chapter 6.
5.15 Before taking legal action, neighbours can try to resolve their dispute
through free mediation provided by community justice
5.16 While common law nuisance is no longer available as a cause of
action for tree disputes in New South Wales,12 an affected
neighbour can still
employ the common law self-help remedy of abatement and cut away encroaching
parts of a tree from their land

boundary line. This may be limited in some cases by the relative prevalence
in NSW of council-based tree protection orders, which
require council approval
for the cutting back of encroaching branches or roots.13
Trees (Disputes Between Neighbours) Act 2006
5.17 The NSW Act governs the resolution of tree disputes in New South Wales
and gives jurisdiction to the NSWLEC to hear these disputes.
5.18 The NSW Act was enacted following the recommendations made by the New
Wales Law Reform Commission in its 1998 report,
Neighbour and Neighbour
5.19 The NSW Act aims to simplify the resolution of tree disputes with
a framework that is more efficient and less costly than
commencing actions in
tort.15 The majority (58 per cent) of neighbours who seek resolution through
the NSWLEC are self-represented.16
5.20 The NSW Act applies only to disputes over trees on adjoining private
land that have caused damage, or are likely to cause damage
or injury in the
future.17 It allows an affected neighbour to bring an application seeking court
orders ‘to remedy, restrain
or prevent’ damage or injury.18 The NSW
Act also allows an affected neighbour to bring legal action in relation to
that severely obstructs sunlight or views.19
New South Wales Land and Environment Court process
5.21 The NSWLEC is a superior court with specialist jurisdiction. Its
decision makers are judges and commissioners, led by a Chief
Judge. Tree
disputes are usually heard by commissioners, at least some of whom will have
specialist knowledge in arboriculture.20
5.22 Before lodging an application with the NSWLEC, the affected neighbour
must first give the opposing party at least 21 days’
notice of their
intention to start legal action along with details about the specific orders
they seek from the Court.21 The affected
neighbour must also notify any other
interested parties, such as the local council.22
5.23 The Court encourages the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
such as mediation, conciliation or neutral evaluation to
resolve disputes.23
The Court reports that ‘in 2011, 59 per cent of matters were resolved by
ADR processes and negotiated
settlement, without the need for a court
hearing’.24 If ADR is unsuccessful or inappropriate, then the matter will
to a hearing.
5.24 Hearings comprise a preliminary hearing and a final hearing, the latter
usually conducted on site.25 Further hearings may be
arranged as needed.26

within three months of filing the application but urgent matters can be heard
and determined within a shorter timeframe.27
5.25 The form that applicants must complete when commencing an action is
relatively clear and straightforward, in recognition of the
fact that most
applicants appear in the Court without legal assistance. The applicant provides
information about the nature and circumstances
of the dispute, and whether they
have made efforts to resolve it. The applicant also responds to matters the
NSWLEC must take into
consideration, such as the tree’s contribution to
the local ecosystem; its historical, cultural and scientific significance;
its heritage value.28
5.26 Parties may engage their own experts to provide expert evidence.
Experts owe a general duty to the Court and must agree
to be bound by the code
of conduct. 29 The Court may direct experts to engage in joint conferencing and
to produce a joint report.30
5.27 Before making any orders, the NSWLEC must be satisfied that the
applicant has made a reasonable effort to reach an agreement
with the tree owner
and that the applicant has complied with the notice requirements.31
5.28 The Court may make orders to:
• ‘remedy, restrain or prevent’ damage to property
• prevent injury to any person, including removal or replacement of the
• mandate payment for works or compensation.32
5.29 Parties can appeal decisions made by a commissioner on a question of law
to a judge of the NSWLEC.33

1000 penalty units.34

5.31 The NSW Act is supported by various policy documents, as well as
Regulations35 and an Annotated Act containing explanatory case
examples.36 The NSWLEC publishes tree dispute principles from time to time to
promote consistent decision making. These principles
can be statements about a
probable outcome, a chain of reasoning, or a list of appropriate matters to be
considered.37 Tree dispute
principles apply only to tree disputes concerning
damage or harm (as opposed to those concerning obstructions to sunlight and
which are also heard in the NSWLEC).38

5.32 In Queensland, tree disputes are heard in the Queensland Civil and
Administrative Tribunal
(QCAT) under the
Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing Fences and Trees) Act
(Qld) (the Queensland Act). Key features of the statutory scheme in
Queensland are discussed in more detail below, and under Option
2 in Chapter
Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing Fences and Trees) Act 2011
5.33 The Queensland Act governs the resolution of tree disputes, and sets out
the rights and responsibilities of tree owners.39 It
gives jurisdiction to QCAT
to hear these disputes.
5.34 The genesis of the Queensland Act was a review conducted by the
Queensland Department of Justice and Attorney-General between
2007 and 2010.40
The Department’s review centred on ‘finding more efficient ways of
assisting neighbours to resolve disputes
neighbouring properties’.41
The Queensland Law Reform Commission conducted a statutory review of the
Queensland Act in 2014.42
5.35 The Queensland Act only applies to trees on private adjoining land
• cause serious damage or injury, or are likely to do so within 12
• produce overhanging branches that are at least 50 centimetres long
and a maximum of 2.5 metres above the ground
• cause substantial, ongoing and unreasonable interference with a
person’s use and enjoyment of their land.43
5.36 The Queensland Act sets out a three-stage process for resolving tree
• informal resolution
• abatement
• formal resolution through QCAT.
5.37 At the first stage, neighbours are encouraged to resolve disputes
informally.44 To assist with this and for clarity, the Queensland
Act sets out
the responsibilities of tree owners. They include ensuring that the tree does
not cause serious injury to a person,
serious damage to land or any property, or
substantial, ongoing and unreasonable interference with a person’s use and
of their land.45 Neighbours can also seek free mediation services
through a Dispute Resolution Centre.46
5.38 If neighbours cannot resolve disputes between themselves, then an
affected neighbour may exercise their common law right of abatement
would be effective, and where branches encroach to a specified extent.47
However, the Queensland Act has modified the common
law right in the following
• The abatement scheme set out in the Act is only applicable to
overhanging branches that are at least 50 centimetres long and
a maximum of 2.5
metres above the ground.
• An affected neighbour must give the tree owner notice of their
intention to abate.

neighbour can recoup the costs from the tree owner.

abatement cannot be exercised or is ineffective, an affected
neighbour can lodge
an application with QCAT to bring legal action.49
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal process
5.40 QCAT is a tribunal set up under the
Queensland Civil and
Administrative Tribunal Act
(Qld) that deals with minor civil disputes.50 It is led by the
President, who is a judicial officer. Tribunal members who determine
matters are
legal experts or other specialists with knowledge relevant to the matter being
5.41 At least 21 days before the date the application is to be heard,
the affected neighbour must provide the tree owner with
a copy of the
application.52 The affected neighbour must also provide any other interested
parties who may be affected by an order
with a copy of the application.53
5.42 Where the dispute is over a minor issue, such as leaf litter or
overhanging branches, QCAT may order parties to participate in
mediation or
compulsory conferencing, which provide an opportunity to resolve the matter
without a QCAT determination.54
5.43 QCAT may also arrange a directions hearing at an early stage in certain
situations before a hearing.55 Tree disputes usually
take some weeks to finalise
from the date the application
is lodged but urgent matters can be heard more quickly. QCAT can also make
interim orders and grant a stay of a decision.56
5.44 The Queensland application form is easy to navigate and complete without
legal assistance. It asks the applicant to provide information
dispute, and the type of orders they seek from QCAT. 57 It also requires the
applicant to respond to matters QCAT must
take into consideration, such as
whether the tree forms part of a dividing fence,
any permission required from local authorities to carry out works, the
tree’s ecological contribution, and its historical, cultural
scientific significance. A similarly detailed response form exists for the other
party to complete. It requires them to explain
what they agree or disagree with,
their reasons for disagreement, and what orders they seek from the tribunal and
5.45 Parties are able to engage their own experts to provide expert evidence.
Alternatively, QCAT will appoint a qualified arborist
to provide expert
evidence.59

of 2013—Arrangements for Applications for
Orders to Resolve Other Issues about Trees
5.46 Experts engaged by parties owe a duty to assist QCAT, which overrides
any obligation to the party that engages them. Experts
from both parties must
produce a joint report detailing matters in agreement and matters in contention
following an ‘experts’
conclave’ convened by QCAT.
5.47 Before making any orders, QCAT must be satisfied that the affected
neighbour has made a reasonable effort to reach an agreement
with the tree owner
and that they have taken all reasonable steps to resolve the issue under any
other applicable law.60
5.48 QCAT can make orders depending on the circumstances of the dispute,
including orders for:
• the removal of a tree
• annual maintenance work
• a survey to be undertaken to clarify who owns the tree
• authorisation of a person to enter the tree owner’s land to
obtain a quote or to carry out work
• compensation or repair costs relating to damage.61
5.49 QCAT can also make orders relating to the recovery of a minor debt where
a party does not pay an amount previously agreed for
carrying out work on a
5.50 An order made by QCAT for certain works to be carried out overrides any
local laws to the contrary, such as, the need for consent
of the local council
or tree owner where the tree is under a vegetation protection order.63 However,
QCAT cannot make an order for
work on a tree that is prohibited by or contrary
to other legislation.64
5.51 Parties can appeal decisions made by members on a question of law, a
question of fact, or both to the Queensland Civil and Administrative
Tribunal.65
5.52 If the tree owner fails to follow an order without reasonable excuse,
they can be held liable for an offence with a maximum of
1000 penalty units.66
The Act also provides
a ‘last resort’ enforcement mechanism that allows the local
council to carry out QCAT orders where the tree owner fails
to do so. However,
this provision is not frequently used.67

5.54 In Tasmania, tree disputes are heard in the Resource Management and
Planning Appeal Tribunal (RMPAT) under the
Neighbourhood Disputes About
Plants Act 2017
(Tas) (the Tasmanian Act).
5.55 At the time of writing, the Tasmanian Act had only recently been enacted
and no tree dispute had yet been brought before RMPAT.69
As a result, most of
the information detailed below reflects RMPAT’s general practices and
procedures. As tree disputes begin
to be brought before RMPAT, it is probable
that this category of dispute will attract its own unique practices and
procedures as
it has in NSWLEC and QCAT. Key features of the statutory scheme in
Tasmania are discussed in more detail below.
Neighbourhood Disputes About Plants Act 2017
5.56 The Tasmanian Act governs the resolution of tree disputes and sets out
the rights and responsibilities of landowners in respect
to trees. Before the
enactment of the Tasmanian Act, neighbours seeking legal relief for their tree
dispute would have had to bring
legal action in the Supreme Court of Tasmania.
Now the Tasmanian Act allows people to take legal action in RMPAT.
5.57 The Tasmanian Act implements most of the recommendations resulting from
the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute’s inquiry into
Problem Trees and Hedges
and is largely modelled on the Queensland Act.70
5.58 Like the Queensland Act, the Tasmanian Act also sets out three ways to
resolve a tree dispute: informal resolution, abatement,
and legal action in
5.59 The rights and responsibilities set out in Part 2 of the Act
‘provide a clear set of rules ... to help landowners and affected
neighbours resolve any issues about a tree’72 without having to take legal
5.60 The Act also allows an affected neighbour to give the tree owner a
written ‘notice about the land affected by the plant’
details about how their land is affected, how the problem can be resolved, and
requesting a written response from the
owner within the period specified in the
notice. This period is to be not less than 14 days.73
5.61 The common law right to abate is preserved but there is no longer any
need to return severed parts of the tree to the tree owner.
There are further
notice requirements for branches that are at least 50 centimetres long and 2.5
metres above the ground.74
5.62 If informal resolution and abatement do not assist in resolving the
matter, an affected neighbour can bring legal action in the
RMPAT where the tree
has ‘caused, is causing, or is likely within the next 12 months to
• serious injury to a person on the affected land
• serious damage to land or property, or
• substantial, ongoing and unreasonable interference with the use and
enjoyment of the land.75

Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal process
5.63 RMPAT is an independent tribunal that hears appeals relating to the
management of natural and physical resources and planning.76
It is led by a
chairperson required to be an Australian legal practitioner of not less than
five years standing.77 Tribunal members
who determine matters are appointed for
their specialist knowledge in ‘planning, engineering, architecture,
science, and environmental
management’.78 The Tribunal is ordinarily
constituted by three members but this number can be increased or reduced.
are usually heard by the chairperson or a member appointed for their
legal knowledge and expertise.79
5.64 The affected neighbour must give the tree owner or any other interested
party notice of the application, the grounds for their
claim and the relief
sought. RMPAT itself may also give such notice to anyone else it thinks will be
affected by the requested relief.80
5.65 Under the Tasmanian Act RMPAT must consider whether the parties have
attempted to resolve the matter themselves before a hearing
RMPAT’s own practice direction on ADR also requires RMPAT to consider
whether the matter could be ‘settled
expeditiously’ through ADR such
as mediation, conciliation or early neutral evaluation.82
5.66 Mediation is the most common form of ADR used by RMPAT. Virtually all
matters will be assessed for their suitability for mediation
exceptional circumstances will justify no mediation.83 Mediation can occur
before a hearing or during a hearing following
an order to stay proceedings.
Matters discussed in mediation remain confidential.84
5.67 Hearings are held in RMPAT’s main location in Hobart.85 Site
inspections are conducted as part of the hearing process and
this is ordinarily
done without parties or their representatives present. However, ‘if the
parties wish to specifically ensure
that the Tribunal members have regard to
certain matters on the subject site’ then they may arrange such a site
and notify RMPAT about it at least seven days before the
5.68 RMPAT must deliver its decision in writing, which is usually done in
‘14 to 21 days from the conclusion of the hearing’.87
5.69 RMPAT has separate application forms for each type of matter it has
under the Tasmanian
Act has not yet been published. However, the Tasmanian Act stipulates that the
following details must be provided
by the affected neighbour in their
application:
• information or evidence (which may be photographic) that is
sufficient to identify the land affected by the tree; the type,
scale and height
of the tree; the tree’s location, and a copy of a certificate of title
• detailed grounds on which the application is made
• the general nature of the relief that is being sought and, if the
relief requires the approval of a government body, then
details about the type
of approval required
• details of the persons or bodies whom the affected neighbour intends
to notify.88

5.76 It is intended that the scheme set out in the Tasmanian Act will be
supported by various resources, such as guides and practice
directions, and a
International jurisdictions
5.77 Key features of the relevant law and practice in New Zealand, Singapore,
Canada and the
United States (US) governing tree disputes are discussed below. The
approaches in each
of these jurisdictions derived originally from the English common law but
have, in modern times, developed independently of it. The
law in Singapore
largely mirrors the law in Victoria. New Zealand, some provinces of Canada and
some states of the United States,
however, have different approaches.
New Zealand
5.78 In New Zealand, neighbours may exercise their right to abate or take
legal action under the
Property Law Act 2007
5.79 The law underpinning the right to abate derives largely from English
and is similar to the law in Victoria. An affected neighbour may abate by
cutting back overhanging branches or encroaching roots
up to the boundary
line.95 A neighbour who abates is not entitled to recover costs from the tree
owner.96 The option to abate may
also be affected if the tree is protected by
Resource Management Act 1991
5.80 Where abatement is unavailable or is ineffective, neighbours are
encouraged to communicate with each other and come to a resolution.
neighbours can also engage mediators and arbitrators to resolve disputes.98

5.81 The New Zealand scheme differs from Victoria in that an affected
neighbour can rely on the
Property Law Act 2007
(NZ) instead of an action
in tort. This Act allows an affected neighbour to seek orders in the District
Court for the trimming or
removal of a tree on the basis that it:
• causes actual or potential risk to their life, health or property
• unduly obstructs a view
• causes undue interference with the use and enjoyment of the
applicant’s land due to leaf litter, overhanging branches
or by blocking
sunlight.99
5.82 An affected neighbour can also seek an order for any costs they have
incurred as a result of abating.
5.83 In making an order, the hardship that would be caused to the affected
neighbour if
the tree remains is balanced against the hardship that will be caused to the
tree owner in complying with any orders made. The court
will also consider
factors such as ‘the public interest in maintaining an aesthetically
pleasing environment; the importance
protecting public reserves containing trees; any historical, cultural or
scientific significance that the tree has, and any likely
effect that removing
or trimming the tree would have on ground stability, the water table, or
run-off’.100
5.84 If an order is not complied with, the affected neighbour can, with the
tree owner or court’s permission, enter the tree
owner’s land to
carry out the works stipulated in the order themselves. They can also recover
from the tree owner any expenses
they incur.101
5.85 In Singapore, neighbours may exercise their right to abate or take legal
action against their neighbour in tort. The law underpinning
the right to abate
and tort law derives largely from English common law and is similar to the law
in Victoria.102
5.86 An affected neighbour may cut back branches that protrude over
their land by exercising their right to abate. However, the
branches, including
any fruit they bear, cannot be kept by the affected neighbour.
5.87 The affected neighbour’s ability to abate may be limited, however,
Parks and Trees
which seeks to preserve certain trees that fall within a
‘tree conservation area’.103
5.88 Where an affected neighbour cannot abate, then they may sue the tree
owner for nuisance where the tree interferes with their
use and enjoyment of the
land, and where it causes damage.104 Claims are brought in the
Magistrates’ Court.105
5.89 A distinctive feature of the Singaporean approach to neighbour disputes
Community Disputes Resolution Act 2015,
which allows neighbours to
bring claims against each other in a Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal
(CDRT). Disputes which
can be brought to the tribunal include those based on unreasonable
interference with the use and enjoyment of a neighbour’s
residence.106

Community Disputes Resolution Act
(Singapore, 2015 rev
5.90 The Act was implemented to provide a ‘last resort for difficult
disputes between neighbours’107 and aims to ‘facilitate
resolution of community disputes by providing for a statutory tort for community
disputes and for the establishment of Community
Disputes Resolution Tribunals to
deal with such disputes’.108 Mediation is encouraged before parties seek
legal recourse in
the CDRT.109
5.91 The framework set out in the
Community Disputes Resolution Act 2015
is an example of how Singapore has sought to streamline the resolution of
neighbourly disputes. The Act sets out a list of actionable
disputes such as
those concerning excessive noise, littering, trespass, interference caused by
animals, and interference with the
neighbour’s moveable property.110
Although tree disputes are not explicitly mentioned in this list, the Act states
list is not exhaustive.111
5.92 The law governing tree disputes in Canada also has its basis in English
Joint ownership
5.93 A distinctive feature of Canadian law is that legislation in some
provinces allows trees to be jointly owned. For example, under
in the province of Ontario, a tree whose trunk grows between two
separate parcels of land is called a ‘boundary tree’
and is jointly
owned by the respective landowners as tenants in common irrespective of who
planted the tree.112 Any action sought
by one co-owner in respect of the tree,
including its removal, must be consented to by the other co-owner.113 Any person
who injures
or destroys a boundary tree without the consent of the co-owners is
guilty of an offence.114
5.94 A similar framework of joint ownership exists in Saskatchewan where
these trees are called ‘straddle trees’.115
However, it differs
from Ontario in that it places importance on how the straddle tree came to exist
between properties.
5.95 A straddle tree planted with agreement between neighbours is
‘owned in common by them and each has a proprietary interest
in the whole
of the tree that may be protected by registration of a caveat’.116
However, ‘Where it is not determinable
which [neighbour] planted the tree
or permitted it to grow initially on [their] property, ownership in common will
not be implied.’117
In such a case, the tree remains the property of the
owner of the land on which the tree was planted even when the trunk, roots and
branches extend into neighbouring property.118
British Columbia Civil Resolution Tribunal
5.96 A distinctive approach to smaller-scale dispute resolution is found
in the British Columbia Civil Resolution Tribunal (the
CRT). The CRT uses online
dispute resolution (ODR) to assist people in resolving small civil claims up to
the value of $5000 Canadian.119
5.97 The CRT began operation in July 2016. All matters filed in the
Provincial Court’s small claims jurisdiction after June
2017 are now dealt
with in the CRT.

5.98 The CRT process can be divided into four main stages:
1) Solution Explorer: a self-driven tool providing information, problem
diagnosis and
self-help tools to help parties understand their rights and obligations, and
to explore possible solutions before formal dispute resolution
or hearings take
place. This is free and available 24 hours a day.
2) Negotiations: the CRT provides tools and guidance for party-to-party
negotiations, and will soon begin hosting an online platform,
allowing parties
to log in and negotiate by exchanging messages.
3) Case management: a CRT case manager can use a range of communication
platforms and tools (phone, email, messaging) to facilitate
negotiation between
the parties. Agreements can then be referred to a Tribunal member to be
converted into a binding order of the
4) Adjudication: if not yet resolved by the preceding steps, a matter can be
transferred to hearing (usually on the papers) by a
tribunal member with
relevant specialist expertise. Decisions of the CRT are binding.120
5.99 Initially, the CRT dealt solely with strata disputes (between parties in
an owners’ corporation), but it has expanded to
provide information and
dispute resolution tools in a range of dispute areas, including:
• payment and quality of goods and services
• personal property rights, including intellectual property and
• debts and payment plans
• residential construction and renovations
• some employment disputes
• insurance disputes
• personal injuries.
5.100 Although neighbourhood tree disputes are not currently heard by the
CRT, this may be a suitable area for future expansion of
the jurisdiction.
United States
5.101 The law in the United States concerning tree disputes also has its
origins in English law but has now developed independently.
An affected
neighbour can use the remedy of self-
for nuisance or negligence. Tree disputes are determined
by state courts, with
each state developing its own common law and interpretation of statute.
5.102 In certain states, whether or not a tree owner is liable in nuisance or
negligence depends on whether the tree grows naturally
or artificially.121 On
rural land, a tree owner is
not liable for any damage or harm caused by a tree that grows naturally.122
‘naturally’ refers to land that has ‘not been changed by
any act of a human being’
and includes ‘the natural growth of trees, weeds, and other vegetation
upon land not artificially made receptive to them’.123
On urban land, the
distinction between naturally and artificially occurring trees is not regarded,
and a tree owner may be liable
‘for harm caused to others outside of the
land by a defect in the condition of a tree’.124

5.103 A distinctive feature of tree ownership in the United States is where a
tree stands on the boundary line with its trunk on both
properties. In this
situation the neighbours own the tree as tenants in common if an
‘intention, acquiescence, or agreement’125
as to its joint ownership
can be demonstrated.126
5.104 While neighbours may abate up to boundary lines in the usual
manner, any significant work that crosses boundary lines or
is concerned with
the removal of the tree must be done with the agreement of owners.127

Options for
reform to the law of neighbourhood tree disputes
84 Introduction
84 Option 1: Retain existing system
85 Option 2: Introduce a statutory scheme
131 Option 3: An alternative option for reform
6. Options for reform to the law of
neighbourhood tree disputes
Introduction
6.1 The Commission has identified three options for reform to the current
process of resolving tree disputes in Victoria:
• Option 1: Make no change and rely on the services provided by the
Settlement Centre of Victoria and the common law.
• Option 2: Introduce a statutory scheme dedicated to the resolution of
tree disputes.
• Option 3: An alternative option for reform.
6.2 Community members and stakeholders may wish to simply state which option
they are for or against. However, as Option 2 raises
detailed questions about
how best to give effect to this option, the Commission invites comments in
relation to these questions under
parts (a) – (m) of Option 2.
6.3 Relevant features of the existing schemes in New South Wales, Queensland
and, to a lesser extent, the newly introduced scheme
in Tasmania, are outlined
and discussed as examples of what may or may not be considered appropriate for
the Victorian context under
Option 1: Retain existing system
6.4 This option preserves the existing process in Victoria for resolving tree
disputes, discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. The
current self-help and
mediation-focussed process allows parties to access free mediation and allows
for some interim steps before
litigation.
6.5 Initially, neighbours can abate any unreasonable interference caused by
Neighbours can cut back encroaching branches or roots up to the boundary line
but must return severed parts of the tree to the tree
6.6 If abatement is inappropriate or does not help resolve a dispute, parties
can access free mediation services via the Dispute Settlement
Centre of Victoria
(DSCV). Mediation through DSCV is a confidential and flexible process that
encourages cooperation between neighbours.
It allows them to formulate their own
resolution of the tree dispute without the cost and formality of legal action.
The form of
mediation can be adapted to suit the dispute. DSCV centres are
widely accessible, with offices in Melbourne and 12 regional locations.2

www.disputes.vic.gov.au
/about-us /mediation
6.7 If neither abatement nor mediation is appropriate or resolves the
dispute, neighbours can bring legal action for nuisance, negligence
or trespass3
in the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria or the County Court of Victoria,
depending on the size of their claim.4
Taking legal action in response to a tree
dispute usually involves expenses in the form of filing fees, legal
representation and
obtaining expert opinions.5
6 If the existing system is retained, are there any specific changes
necessary to improve it?
Option 2: Introduce a statutory scheme
6.8 As discussed in Chapter 5, New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania have
enacted statutory schemes specific to resolving tree
6.9 These schemes were enacted in order to provide neighbours with access to
a fairer and more effective legal mechanism than that
offered by the common law.
Some of the overarching aims of these schemes include:
• clarifying rights and responsibilities of tree owners and affected
neighbours so that tree disputes can be prevented from
• enabling people to more easily take legal action without legal
representation
• allowing people to resolve tree disputes quickly
• reducing the cost of taking legal action.
6.10 As outlined in Chapter 1, many people believe the process in Victoria
for resolving tree disputes is confusing, ineffective and
costly. Some common
criticisms include:
• The available common law causes of action are hard to navigate and
understand.
• The rights and responsibilities of neighbours at common law are
• Mediation may not be appropriate in all disputes, particularly where
the dispute has escalated.
• Any agreement reached in DSCV-led mediation is not binding and
depends on voluntary action.
• The cost of taking legal action to obtain a binding resolution (eg
lawyers’ fees and/or court fees) may be prohibitive.
6.11 In its report
Problem Trees and Hedges: Access to Sunlight and
, the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute concluded that the Victorian
model, based predominantly on alternative dispute resolution for
resolving tree
disputes, was able to provide only limited relief and was therefore undesirable
to adopt in Tasmania.6
6.12 A statutory scheme dedicated to tree disputes may be more accessible and
easier to navigate than the common law. Such a scheme
may help to resolve tree
disputes about damage and harm in more fair and efficient ways, and to bring the
law up-to-date with the
community’s views about the obligations neighbours
owe to each other with respect to the trees growing on their land.

7 Should a statutory scheme for resolving tree disputes be adopted in
What should the overarching aims of a new scheme be?
6.13 If a statutory scheme is to be adopted, there are further details that
need to be considered.
6.14 The Commission considers below some specific elements of a possible
statutory scheme, exploring options and providing a comparison
6.15 Community feedback is sought on these and any other elements that should
be considered in assessing the desirability of a statutory
framework for
a) which trees and vegetation should be covered by the scheme
b) the relevant location of trees, including zoning considerations and the
nature of adjoining land
c) who can bring an action (standing) and who can be found liable for harm
or damage caused
d) the degree and subject of damage or interference that could be
considered under a new scheme
e) the degree and subject of harm that could be considered under a new
scheme f) the appropriate jurisdiction for determining disputes
under a new
g) preconditions to be met in order to bring an action under the new scheme
h) factors to be considered by a decision maker under
a new scheme
i) the types of orders and enforcement available under a new scheme j) the
effect of a new scheme on the current law
k) processes for handling expert evidence
l) the impact on and responsibility of new owners of land m) enhancing
useability.
6.16 Key features of both the New South Wales and Queensland schemes have
informed the Commission’s identification of further
issues that need to be
considered. Each of these features are discussed in further detail below and
provide examples of possible
approaches. The general features of the
newly-introduced Tasmanian scheme are also discussed.
(a) Trees and vegetation covered by the scheme
6.17 In designing a statutory scheme for Victoria, it is important to
consider what type of vegetation would be covered.
6.18 Defining trees too broadly may create a lack of clarity for those
without arboricultural expertise; conversely, defining a tree
too narrowly may
exclude some disputes.
Trees (Disputes Between Neighbours) Act 2006
NSW) (the NSW
Act) defines a tree
as ‘any woody perennial plant, any plant resembling a tree in form and
size, and any other plant prescribed by the Regulations’.7
6.20 Bamboo, technically a type of grass, was originally excluded from the
definition of ‘tree’ under the NSW Act, but
since 2007 has been
prescribed under the
Trees (Disputes Between Neighbours) Regulation 2014
(the NSW Regulations), having the effect of including it in the relevant
definition.8
6.21 Vines were also excluded from the definition of ‘tree’.9 In
Buckingham v Ryder
,10 a dispute between neighbours over a pink trumpet
vine was dismissed because it was determined that vines generally do not meet
the definition of a ‘tree’ under the Act—vines do not display
the self-supporting characteristics of trees and
instead require a surface to
grow along.11
6.22 However, following statutory review of the Act by the New South Wales
Government in
2009, it was decided that vines can cause damage to, for example, ‘the
paintwork on the outside of a house, or caus[e] water
damage by blocking a
downpipe or drain’, or pose
a risk of injury. The review concluded that there was no reason why disputes
relating to vines should have to be resolved by ‘the
more complicated
procedure in nuisance’12 and recommended that vines be declared a
prescribed plant under the NSW Regulations.
This was done in 2014.13
Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing Fences and Trees) Act 2011
(Qld) (the Queensland Act) defines a tree more broadly, as ‘any woody
perennial plant or any plant resembling a tree in form
and size as well as a
vine and anything listed in regulation’.14 Examples listed in the
legislation are bamboo, banana plant,
palm, cactus and vine.15 It also includes
parts of a tree in its definition, such as ‘a bare trunk; and a stump
rooted in the
land; and a dead tree’.16
6.24 In its review of the Queensland Act, the Queensland Law Reform
Commission (QLRC) recommended that the definition of a tree should
also include
‘a root or the roots of any living or dead tree’.17 The QLRC
reasoned that roots, on their own, can be a
cause of disputes between neighbours
and incorporating roots into the definition of a tree would make it consistent
with other provisions
in the Act referring to the cutting back of roots.18
However, this has not yet been adopted into the Queensland Act.
6.25 In 2017 the Tasmanian Parliament introduced the
Neighbourhood
Disputes About Plants
(the Tasmanian Act). Section 4 of the Tasmanian Act defines a
plant to include a
‘tree; a hedge or group of plants; fruits, seeds, leaves or flowers of
a plant; a bare trunk; a stump rooted in land; any root
of a plant and a dead
plant’.19 The definition in the Tasmanian Act is the only one expansive
enough to cover products of
6.26 As noted in Chapter 2, some local laws also define ‘tree’ in
the context of council tree protection mechanisms and
tree maintenance works.
The Melbourne City Council’s definition includes ‘the trunk,
branches, canopy and root system
of the tree’.20 Nillumbik Shire Council
defines a tree as a ‘long lived woody perennial plant (usually) greater

6.27 There is a variety of tree definitions in the above discussion. Some
incorporate taxonomical descriptions and refer to individual
parts of the tree
and their size. Other
disputes have also been recognised in relevant Acts and Regulations.
8 What type of vegetation should be covered by a statutory scheme? Is there
any vegetation that should not be covered?
(b) Location of trees and land
6.28 The location of a tree may be determinative of an owner’s or
neighbour’s rights to manage the tree. Three main elements
are discussed
below: the zone in which the tree is located, to what extent the tree must be
located on this land, and how this land
adjoins an affected neighbour’s
6.29 In some jurisdictions, the zone in which a tree is located may determine
whether neighbours are able to use the relevant statutory
dispute resolution
6.30 Two main reasons have been given for this in reviews conducted in New
South Wales and Queensland. The first is that neighbours
involved in a tree
dispute on rural land may not require the same remedies as those in urban
areas,23 and because of the vast spaces
associated with rural land, disputes do
not commonly arise.24 The second reason is that any Act governing tree
disputes may have
the potential to contravene or contradict existing legislation
that protects biodiversity, especially in particular zones. For example,
in Victoria, this could include the
Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994
Fauna Guarantee Act 1988
6.31 In its earlier incarnation, the NSW Act only applied to ‘urban
land’. However, following a statutory review of the
Act by the New South
Wales Government in 2009, it was considered that this limit excluded some
community members who needed to resolve
[some individuals] were not able to bring proceedings relating to damage or
risk of injury under the [NSW] Act, because the zoning
of the private land on
which the tree was situated was outside the scope of the Act. One of these
related to a tree that had reportedly
been found unsafe by the Local Council.
When the owner of the tree did not do any work, the adjoining neighbours applied
to the Land
and Environment Court for orders that work be done on the tree.
However, after a preliminary hearing their

to ‘provide arborists, tree workers,
government departments, property
owners, and contractors with a guide defining uniform tree pruning procedures
and practices in order
to minimize the adverse or negative impact of pruning on
trees’. Part 3.5 defines a ‘branch’ as ‘a lateral
on a main axis such as trunk or another branch. A branch arising off a trunk is
a first order branch. A branch arising off
a first order branch is a second
order branch and so on. Second and successive orders of branches may be referred
to as ‘lateral
branches’.’

application was dismissed because the tree was found to be on land zoned
residential’. In these situations, the only legal recourse is to sue in
nuisance.26
6.32 A recommendation to broaden the application of the NSW Act to cover
rural–residential zones was later enacted.
6.33 Currently in New South Wales, the Act applies to trees located on land
as residential, rural–residential, village, township, industrial or
business under an environmental planning instrument.27
The NSW Act does not
apply to trees on public land.28
6.34 In Queensland, the scheme is more limited and applies to trees in urban
areas only.
More specifically, it does not apply to trees on rural land, on land that is
more than four hectares in size, on land owned by a local
government that is
used as a public park, trees planted or maintained for certain purposes (such as
for commercial production), or
trees planted as a condition of a development
approval.29
6.35 In its statutory review of the Queensland Act, the QLRC rejected the
inclusion of rural land because it would have an impact
on Queensland’s
Planning Principles and their objectives.30
6.36 The Tasmanian Act does not apply to plants on ‘excluded
land’: council-owned or managed land, rail network land,
reserves, and
certain forestry land.31 Plants ‘necessary or desirable for the management
or operation’ of certain farms
will also be exempt.32
6.37 The Second Reading Speech preceding the enactment of the Tasmanian Act
explains the reasoning behind their exclusion:
these excluded categories are more likely to capture large parcels of land
that are located in rural or remote locations—the
land is often
unoccupied, or it may have high conservation value or serve some other kind of
public purpose or be of benefit to the
broader community.
It should also be noted that these exclusions are largely consistent with the
and under similar laws in
Queensland and New South Wales.33
Tree wholly or partially on land
6.38 In Victoria, the location of a tree on private land and therefore the
ownership of the
tree is usually determined by reference to the location of its trunk.34 A
tree is considered a ‘fixture’ on the land—a
tangible item of
personal property that is attached to and therefore forms part of the land.35
However, it is possible for a tree
to grow between two parcels of land and
‘straddle’ the boundary line. This may create ambiguity as to who
owns the tree
for the purposes of new legislation.
6.39 In New South Wales, the tree affecting a neighbour must also be
‘wholly or principally’ on adjoining land.36
,37 the affected neighbour brought an application in respect of a
tree that overhung his property and straddled the boundary of two

6.41 In Tasmania, a tree is ‘situated on land’ if the base of the
trunk, or the place at which the stem of the plant connects
with the roots of
the plant, is in whole or in part, on the land.40 Even if a tree straddles the
boundary of adjoining properties,
for the purposes
of bringing an action under the Act, the tree will be treated as if it lies
wholly on the neighbouring land. That is, either neighbour,
although both are
technically tree owners, can have recourse if the tree is affecting them in the
ways covered by the Act. In determining
the extent to which the tree is
affecting a neighbour, the proportion of the tree situated on each area of land
will be taken into
Adjoining land
6.42 As a Victorian Act would aim to provide effective resolution of tree
disputes between neighbours, the land on which the tree
is located may need to
be within a certain proximity to or in a particular relationship to the land of
the person who brings an action.
In New South Wales and Queensland, the two
parcels of land must be directly adjoining in order to fall under the scope of
their respective
Acts, whereas in Tasmania, neighbours on non-adjoining land can
take legal action.
6.43 In New South Wales, adjoining land:
includes properties that abut each other, but might also include properties
that are separated by other land, such as a public road
or drainage easement,
provided there is a relevant connection in the sense that the tree growing on
one property is capable of causing
damage to the other property or injuring
persons on that other property.42
,43 an affected neighbour’s application in
respect of a Sydney blue gum, which had previously dropped branches and caused
was dismissed by the Court because his land was ‘separated ... by
another residential allotment’ and was, more specifically,
properties to the east’ of the tree owner’s land. The affected
neighbour’s application was therefore
beyond the jurisdiction of the
Court, and the potentially hazardous nature of the tree could not be considered
through that application.44
This decision was upheld on appeal.45
6.45 If the tree has caused damage to multiple properties on adjoining land,
then separate applications for each affected property
would be required.46
6.46 In Queensland, adjoining land is the land on either side of a common
boundary. The tree must be on land that adjoins the tree
owner’s land, or
would adjoin the land if it were not separated by a road.47 For larger,
agricultural parcels of land, the
Queensland Act specifies that land will be
considered to be adjoining even where it is on the other side of a road,
if the neighbours agree to this construction, or if the Queensland Civil and
Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) decides a fence has been
or could be used to
divide the two parcels of land.48

Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing Fences and Trees) Act 2011
6.47 In Tasmania, an affected neighbour may take action under the Tasmanian
Act even if their land does not adjoin the tree owner’s
land,49 as long as
part of their land is within
25 metres of the base of the trunk or where the stem connects to a root
system.50 This broader provision ‘recognises that in
some cases tree
roots can extend horizontally to a distance of up to 25 metres’.51
6.48 A Victorian Act would need to address the appropriate location of the
tree affecting a neighbour. This comprises the zoning classification
of the land
on which the tree is located, whether the tree is to be wholly or partially on
the land, and whether the land on which
the tree is located needs to adjoin the
affected neighbour’s land.
9 Should the application of a statutory scheme be limited to land in
particular zones? If so, which zones?
10 Should there be a requirement that the affected neighbour’s land
the tree owner’s land? If so, how should the relevant degree of
proximity be defined?
11 How should trees that are partially on the tree owner’s land be
dealt with under a statutory scheme?
(c) Standing and liability
6.49 The question of which neighbours can make an application (that is, who
has ‘standing’) and who can be held liable
is usually determined
based on the person’s relationship to the land.52
6.50 Not all people who are present on the land affected by the tree may be
able to take legal action as the affected neighbour. Similarly,
not all people
present on the land on which the tree is located may be held liable as the tree
6.51 The possible requirements for standing and basis of liability are
explored below.
Standing of affected neighbour
6.52 Currently in Victoria, in order to have standing to bring a legal action
for nuisance, the affected neighbour must be in possession
of the land affected
by the tree: as its owner, tenant or licensee with exclusive possession.53
6.53 In New South Wales, in order to bring an action under the NSW Act, an
affected neighbour must be an owner or an occupier of the
land.54 If there are
multiple owners or occupiers then any one of them can make an application.55
6.54 The same is true in Queensland:56 owners or occupiers of registered
freehold land, or a body corporate, can bring legal action.57
However, tenants
are first advised to raise their concerns with their landlord or agent. If this
does not resolve the matter, they
may take legal action, but must show that the
landlord refused to take any action.58

Liability of tree owner
6.57 Currently in Victoria, in order to be held liable, the tree owner must
have created, adopted or continued the nuisance.63
6.58 In New South Wales, actions under the NSW Act can be brought
against the owner or occupier of the land on which the tree
is situated.64 The
NSW Act does not contain any provisions detailing liability or notice
requirements for multiple tree owners.65
6.59 In Queensland, actions can be brought against a tree owner who owns,
occupies or has control over the land on which the tree
is located. This
includes: the owner of registered freehold land, tenant, licensee, grantee of a
permit, body corporate, or, if the
land on which the tree is located is in a
reserve, then the trustee of the reserve.66 If there is more than one tree
they all share equal liability, but notice of the application in QCAT
can be satisfied by notifying any one of the tree owners.67
6.60 In Tasmania, actions can be brought against an owner of land on which
the tree is located. If there are multiple owners of land
on which the tree is
located then each owner is jointly and severally liable for the tree. Notice of
an application in the Resource
Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal (RMPAT) can be given to any of the

13 Who should be liable for harm or damage caused under a new scheme?
(d) Damage or interference
6.61 Damage claims relate to property rather than people. The scope of damage
that is to be captured by any new scheme is important
to consider, and comprises
three key elements: the degree of damage, the subject of damage, and future
damage. These three elements
are discussed in more detail below.
59 An owner of land is considered to be a person with joint or several
freehold possession of land; a life tenant; the lessee of a
99 years; licensees with a right to occupy or manage Crown land; a body
corporate, or any other person with an interest in the land
prescribed under the

Degree of damage or interference
6.62 Whether a new scheme should broadly capture damage of any kind or only
damage that is of a significant degree will determine
what sort of claims for
damage will be actionable.
6.63 In New South Wales, any sort of damage, regardless of its degree, can be
claimed before the NSW Land and Environment Court (NSWLEC).69
However, a tree
that merely causes interference, which in turn causes annoyance or discomfort to
the affected neighbour without
causing any actual damage, does not fall within
the jurisdiction of the NSW Act.70
For example, dropping of leaf litter into neighbouring land will not
constitute damage, neither will the cleaning of resultant mould
or slime.71
6.64 In Queensland, the scope of damage is narrower because only
‘serious’ damage will qualify.72 However, unlike the
Queensland also covers ‘interference’ which is
‘substantial, ongoing and unreasonable’; it is not necessary for
actual damage to have been caused.73 For example, the
‘substantial,
ongoing and unreasonable’ accumulation of leaf litter in a
neighbour’s gutters74 or pool75 will
be sufficient for QCAT to intervene
and make orders. However, in most cases concerning leaf litter, this threshold
is not likely
be satisfied. Leaf litter is generally considered ‘to be expected in
urban or suburban areas with trees’ and it is reasonable
to expect that
residents ‘will perform some level of regular maintenance, including
cleaning gutters and leaf litter’.76
6.65 The Tasmanian Act also mandates that damage must be
‘serious’ and that any interference with the ‘use and
of the affected neighbour’s land must be of a
‘substantial, ongoing and unreasonable’ nature in order to be
actionable.77
Subject of damage or interference
6.66 The subject of damage relates to whether damage to any property on
neighbouring land (such as a house, a garden shed, or car),
or also to the land
itself (such as a garden), should be considered actionable damage.
6.67 In New South Wales, the subject of damage must be ‘property on the
land’,78 which is not only real property but also
‘buildings, fences, paving or other structures, or to fruit trees, crops,
ornamental gardens or other vegetation
growing on a neighbour’s
land’ and ‘moveable objects or corporeal chattels, such as
animals,79 vehicles or furniture,
that may be located on, but are not attached
to or part of the ground’.80
69 ‘An owner of land may apply to the Court for an order to remedy,
restrain or prevent damage to property on the land, or to
prevent injury
to any person, as a consequence of a tree to which this Act applies that is
situated on adjoining land.’:

outdoor furniture and motor vehicles ‘property on
the land’.81

by cases concerning sewer pipes.82

Future damage or interference
6.70 Trees that have not caused problems in the past may, after growth, or a
change in health, go on to affect a neighbour’s
6.71 It is important to consider whether, under a Victorian scheme, affected
neighbours can seek relief where a tree has not yet caused
damage but is
expected to do so. If so, the question must be considered of how far into the
future expected damage should extend.
6.72 The New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmanian schemes allow neighbours
to bring legal action for expected future damage.
6.73 In New South Wales, people are allowed to bring claims to prevent
damage. Orders to prevent the damage cannot be made unless
the court is
satisfied that the damage is
likely to occur in the ‘near future’, which has been interpreted
to mean within the next 12 months.86
6.74 In Queensland, the Act explicitly states that future damage must be
likely to ‘occur within the next 12 months’.87
This is also the
case in Tasmania.88

relation to damage and interference.

6.76 Harm in this paper refers to harm to people—causing injury or
otherwise affecting their health or safety. Under the New
South Wales,
Queensland and Tasmanian schemes, harm is called ‘injury’.89
6.77 It is important to consider the degree of harm to be captured under any
scheme, as well as the subject of harm and future harm.
These three elements are
discussed in more detail below.
Degree of harm
6.78 In considering the degree of harm caused by a tree to a person, a
Victorian scheme would need to make clear the degree of harm
actionable. For example, whether there must be significant harm caused to a
person or whether any type of harm, even mere
discomfort to a person, would be
sufficient.90
6.79 Currently in Victoria, a number of Acts contain definitions of
‘injury’ and require claimants to have sustained a
certain degree of
harm in the form of a ‘significant’ or ‘serious’ injury
in order to be compensated.91
6.80 In New South Wales, there is no definition of the term
‘injury’ or a required threshold degree of harm stipulated
Act. Decisions of the NSWLEC indicate that exacerbations of medical conditions
such as asthma and allergies will constitute
an injury in addition to bodily
6.81 Affected neighbours must produce ‘medical or arboricultural
evidence and any supporting medical or arboricultural
peer-reviewed
literature’ that supports their claim that the tree is the cause of the
6.82 In Queensland and Tasmania, injury to persons must be
‘serious’.94 The Queensland Act does not define serious injury
does state that ‘a severe allergic reaction’ would meet the
definition.95
Subject of harm
6.83 The question also arises whether, in addition to occupants of a
property, temporary visitors should be covered.
6.84 In New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, any person injured on the
land affected by the tree can make an application.96
6.85 Further, in New South Wales, a neighbour can bring an application if
they believe injury may be caused to another person not
on the affected
neighbour’s land. In
Ashworth v Joyce,
97 the affected neighbour
argued that some dead trees on adjoining land ‘were likely to cause injury
to persons on an adjacent
public beach reserve’. In
98 a tree was ordered to be removed because it was considered it may
cause injury not only to people on the affected neighbour’s
land but also
people on the tree owner’s land.

90 A specific example in the Victorian context is pollen from trees, which is
known to cause hay fever, and may need to be considered.
In New South Wales, hay
fever was put forward by community members as a type of interference caused by
trees: New South Wales Law

6.86 As noted above, in Tasmania, the harmed or injured person does not need
to be on land that adjoins the tree owner’s land.
Instead, land needs to
be within 25 metres of the tree.99
Future harm
6.87 Trees are dynamic, living organisms. It is therefore important to
consider whether an affected neighbour can seek relief in
relation to a tree
that has not yet caused harm but is expected to do so. If so, it is also
important to consider how far into the
future the likelihood of harm should
6.88 The schemes in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania allow neighbours
to bring legal action for injury likely to occur in
the future.
6.89 In New South Wales, people may make claims to prevent injury. Unlike the
case for future damage, there is no requirement that
harm is likely to occur
‘in the near future’.100
6.90 However, in Queensland and Tasmania, ‘serious injury’ must
be likely within 12 months.101
In Queensland, factors such as the size and health of the tree and weather
conditions may be taken into account to assess the likely
seriousness of the
future injury.102
6.91 A Victorian scheme would need to address the degree of harm, the subject
of harm and future harm.
18 What degree of harm should be sufficient to bring an action under a
statutory scheme?
19 How should the relevant subject of the harm be determined? Should harm
include harm to occupiers only, to others on the land, or
to anyone at
20 Should future harm be actionable under a statutory scheme? If so, should
a particular time period be specified?
(f) Jurisdiction
6.92 Which court or tribunal should have decision-making jurisdiction over a
new scheme is another important consideration.
6.93 Tree disputes are heard in the Land and Environment Court (NSWLEC) in
New South Wales, the Queensland Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (QCAT) in
Queensland and the Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal (RMPAT)
in Tasmania.
6.94 The NSWLEC is a superior court, with equal status to the NSW Supreme
Court, where tree disputes are heard and determined by commissioners
specialised expertise in areas such as arboriculture, town planning,
environmental science, land valuation, urban design, and
law.103 Hearings are
often conducted on site.104

6.96 RMPAT is an independent tribunal that determines and reviews matters
relating to the management of natural and physical resources

Members are appointed for their specialist knowledge in ‘planning,

6.97 Some other notable approaches that could help inform Victoria’s
choice of jurisdiction include the Australian Capital Territory
Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) and Singapore’s Community Disputes
Resolution Tribunals.
6.98 ACAT can hear and determine small civil claims, including those based on
nuisance, negligence and trespass where the claim is
under $25,000.108
6.99 This approach is to be contrasted with Victoria, South Australia,
Western Australia and the
Northern Territory, where tree disputes are heard and
determined by the courts.
6.100 ACAT aims to resolve disputes in a timely, economical and less formal
manner where parties are able to represent themselves
instead of having to
engage legal counsel.109
6.101 As discussed in Chapter 5, in Singapore, neighbour disputes are
resolved in specialised Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals
(CDRTs) under
Community Disputes Resolution Act 2015
.110 CDRTs operate under a
division of state courts and deal exclusively with neighbour disputes. Matters
are heard by tribunal judges
who are appointed district judges of the State
6.102 In Victoria, tree disputes can currently be heard in the
Magistrates’ Court, County Court and (very rarely) in the Supreme
Court.112 Whether or not jurisdiction should remain with these courts, or
another forum, such as the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT) or
an alternative forum altogether, needs to be considered. The current and
possible Victorian jurisdictions are
discussed below.
6.103 As each of these jurisdictions has recently been examined by the 2016
Access to Justice
, some of the resulting observations and
recommendations from that review which are most pertinent to the resolution of
tree disputes
are also considered.113
Magistrates’ Court of Victoria
6.104 The Magistrates’ Court has jurisdiction to hear civil matters
such as tree disputes where amounts claimed are no more
than $100,000. The cost
of commencing a tree dispute can range between $142 and $677.50 and depends on
the amount claimed. This basic
filing fee cost is independent of other
applicable court fees and legal representation.
6.105 Unlike comparable lower courts in other states and territories, the
Magistrates’ Court also has equitable jurisdiction,
meaning that it may
‘hear and determine any claim for equitable relief’, which may
include injunctions and damages in
equity.114 The jurisdictional limit for
claims for equitable relief is also $100,000.

Actions in negligence and trespass can also be brought but as

disputes. See, eg,

Magistrates’ Court Act 1989
(1)(a) – (b);
(1) (‘jurisdictional limit’).
6.106 The Magistrates’ Court has the power to grant injunctions at any
time during proceedings,115 or in urgent cases, before
proceedings have
started.116 Within the limits of its monetary jurisdiction, the Court’s
powers to grant injunctions are as
extensive as those of the Supreme Court or
the County Court.117
6.107 The Magistrates’ Court has the same power to make orders and
directions in civil proceedings as the Supreme Court and
County Court, under the
Civil Procedure Act
(Vic).118 The Court may give any directions it considers
appropriate about the use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in
resolution of a civil case.119
Subject matter expertise
6.108 The Magistrates’ Court has a specific process for dealing with
smaller claims, such
as neighbourhood disputes, which is designed to keep costs down, encourage
early resolution and divert simpler cases away from full
hearings. Where parties
are seeking relief under $10,000, they will be referred for compulsory
arbitration.120 Parties may also mutually
agree to undertake arbitration, or one
party will apply and the other will be required to participate.
6.109 The arbitration process is less formal and simpler than a hearing, as
it may involve a relaxation of the rules of evidence
and procedure, and fixed
costs, depending on the facts of the case.121 The parties’ cases are
heard by an independent arbitrator,
who is empowered to make a binding decision
6.110 The Magistrates’ Court monitors the accessibility and ease of use
for people claiming in this jurisdiction, including
reviewing court information,
forms and procedures, ‘to ensure that best practices are in place to
secure efficient resolution
of cases’.122
6.111 Relevantly, the Magistrates’ Court currently hears fence disputes
(Vic), based on the new scheme effected by the
Amendment Act 2014
(Vic).123 These disputes include matters regarding the
construction or repair of a dividing fence, such as who pays, what type of
is built and where it is placed.124 The Magistrates’ Court has power to
make a broad range of orders in relation to fencing
disputes.125
Flexibility
6.112 The Magistrates’ Court has attributes which allow it to respond
flexibly and efficiently to a wide range of civil matters.
Magistrates’ Court sits at 51 metropolitan and regional locations in
Victoria126 and also operates through specialist court
models that are
comparatively informal and flexible.127 These have been adapted for distinct
and are reflected in the Koori Court, the Drug Court of Victoria and the

6.113 Of all Victorian courts, self-represented litigants appear most
frequently in the Magistrates’ Court.129 The number of
people representing
themselves in the Magistrates’ Court is steadily increasing and the Court
is working towards updating its
website and forms with clearer information so
that self-represented litigants can more easily navigate the Court’s
and procedures.130 Furthermore, the 2016
Access to Justice Review
recommended that the Magistrates’ Court should ‘develop
materials, improve procedures and make increased use of technology
self-represented litigants’.131
Alternative dispute resolution
6.114 As well as compulsory arbitration for matters under $10,000, the
Magistrates’ Court
also offers a variety of mechanisms to support early resolution of disputes,
including pre- hearing conferences,132 mediation, ‘early
evaluation’ and arbitration.133
6.115 Pre-hearing conferences, if directed by the Court, are compulsory for
the parties and their lawyers to attend and are generally
heard before an
experienced Registrar. The Registrar assists the parties by identifying and
exploring the issues and by promoting
settlement.134
If no resolution is reached, the Registrar may make directions for the
dispute to proceed to a hearing.135
6.116 With or without the parties’ consent,136 the Court may refer
them to mediation with a Registrar, a Judicial Registrar
or an external mediator
such as the DSCV.137 As noted above, mediations conducted by the DSCV are free
of charge to the parties.138
Mediation before
a Registrar costs $252.30, and $437.70 before a Judicial Registrar.139 If
the parties select a mediator from the Court’s list
of approved mediators,
there is a flat fee of $1,320 plus the cost of a mediation venue to be shared
between the parties.140 The
standard timeframe
for a matter to be mediated as part of the Magistrates’ Court process
is 60 days.141
6.117 A Registrar can also direct a matter to proceed to early neutral
evaluation.142 This process involves a magistrate, in the presence
parties and their legal representatives, hearing a statement of the relevant
evidence and principles of law from each party,
facilitating discussion between
the parties and presenting a non-binding opinion on the likely outcome of the
dispute.143
6.118 If the parties do not reach a resolution in that forum, their matter
can proceed to a hearing. Early neutral evaluation does
not prejudice
parties’ chances in any future hearing, as the magistrate who presided
over the process will not determine the
case at hearing.144

6.122 The County Court has original, unlimited jurisdiction in all civil
matters and can hear tree disputes for claims over $100,000.
The cost of
bringing a tree dispute in the County Court is higher than the
Magistrates’ court, with a basic filing fee of $851.80.
cost is independent of other applicable court fees, such as daily hearing
fees and legal representation.
Subject matter expertise
6.123 Claims based on tort are heard in the Court’s Common Law
Division, which comprises eight specialist lists.148 Tree disputes
generally be heard in the General List.149
6.124 Most tree disputes heard in the County Court have been transferred from
the Magistrates’ Court.150
Flexibility
6.125 As set out in the governing practice note: ‘The aim of the
County Court in civil litigation is to list, hear and determine
cases quickly
and cost-effectively, consistent with the demands of justice and, in particular,
with the requirements of the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
6.126 The County Court sits in Melbourne and in 12 regional locations. These
are Bairnsdale, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Horsham,
Mildura, La Trobe Valley
(Morwell), Sale, Shepparton, Wangaratta, Warrnambool and Wodonga.152
6.127 The Court has instituted the County Koori Court, a specialist model
that demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the
practices and procedures to specific matters.153
6.128 The Court has also published a practice note which outlines the
management of self- represented litigants in the Common Law
Division.154 The
practice note applies to any matter where one or more litigants are
self-represented. It appoints a judge in charge
of self-represented litigation
and a self-represented litigant coordinator who work together to manage
self-represented litigants
and the proceedings in which they are a party. For
example, once a matter is listed, self-represented litigants are able to contact
the coordinator for assistance with the form and content of documents to be

its website.
A webpage, ‘Are You Representing Yourself?’, contains contact
details of the self- represented litigant coordinator and
a short film
containing a ‘step by step guide to each major step in a civil
proceeding’.158 There is also a downloadable
guide for self- represented
litigants.159
6.130 However, it was noted in the
Access to Justice
review that the
‘practices and procedures in the higher courts are more complicated and
technical than in the Magistrates’
Court or VCAT’160 and that self-represented litigants may be
disadvantaged and
‘feel disempowered’ by these ‘formal and opaque’
court practices.161 The review recommended ways the higher
courts should
improve the way they work with self- represented litigants as well as improving
interpreter services and establishing
a ‘self- representation
service’ in conjunction with the community legal sector.162
Alternative dispute resolution and judicial mediation
6.131 The County Court also employs alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
processes and judicial mediation. The Court’s ADR practice,
established in
2009, aims to provide parties ‘with a timely and cost effective avenue to
have their matter resolved’.163
ADR such as mediation
is encouraged in the majority of cases.164
Section 47A
Court Act 1958
(Vic) provides that the Court may, with or without the
consent of the parties, refer the whole or any part of a civil proceeding to
mediation or arbitration.165
6.132 The Standard Mediation Procedures also sets out the Court’s
‘expectations as to how ... mediation is to be conducted’,
that the parties agree on a mediator, and take all necessary steps to ensure the
mediation goes ahead at the appointed
day and time.166
6.133 Mediation is initially ordered two to three months before hearing,167
and further mediation may be ordered at or just before
the trial.168
6.134 Mediation is mandatory before any matter proceeds to trial where one or
both of the parties are self-represented, unless otherwise
ordered by the judge
in charge.169 If the judge in charge is satisfied that it is appropriate,
parties may undertake case conferencing
instead of mediation.170
6.135 The Court may also use judicial resolution conferences, a form of
judicial mediation, in certain matters. Judicial mediation
differs from standard
mediation in that judicial officers

instead of private mediators conduct these conferences.171 For example, in
family provision claims where the estate is under $700,000,
parties are
‘automatically referred to a judicial resolution conference conducted by a
judge, while for claims above that amount,
parties can choose private mediation
instead. No fee is charged for a conference.’172
6.136 Appeals from decisions of the County Court are to the Court of Appeal
(if the Court of Appeal grants leave to appeal).173 Where
the County Court
decision was made by an Associate Judge, the right of appeal is to the Trial
Division of the Supreme Court.174
Supreme Court of Victoria
6.137 The Supreme Court is the highest court in Victoria and deals with the
most serious criminal and civil matters.175 As discussed
at [3.76] –
[3.80], the Supreme Court has original, unlimited jurisdiction to hear all civil
matters, and is theoretically
able to hear large tree disputes under its Common
Law Division’s Major Torts List. The Supreme Court very rarely hears
neighbourhood
tree disputes as such, unless a case also involves other legal
issues.176 Costs of bringing a tree dispute in the Supreme Court are
higher than
the Magistrates’ Court and County Court, with a basic filing fee of
$1065.10. This cost is independent of other
applicable court fees, such as daily
hearing fees and legal representation.
Subject matter expertise
6.138 The Court’s Major Torts List ‘is designed to facilitate and
expedite the passage of large or otherwise significant
tortious claims to
6.139 Procedure followed in the Major Torts Lists is set out in a practice
note,178 which outlines the types of proceedings ‘suitable
for inclusion
in the list’. Those potentially relevant to neighbourhood tree disputes
• large, complex or otherwise significant tortious claims179
• tortious claims for economic loss or property damage180
• nuisance claims, including land contamination claims181
• claims based on intentional torts182
• tortious claims of significant public interest.183
Flexibility
6.140 The Supreme Court is located in Melbourne. Where a cause of action
arises in regional Victoria, parties are directed to initiate
the matter in the
Civil Circuit List of the Regional Circuit Court, which sits in 12 regional
districts across Victoria on scheduled
dates throughout the calendar year.184
The regional districts are Ballarat, Mildura, Bendigo, Sale, Geelong,
Shepparton, Hamilton,
Wangaratta, Horsham, Warrnambool, Morwell and
Wodonga.185

6.141 The Supreme Court has taken steps to create greater clarity for
self-represented litigants.
The Court provides a suite of resources for self-represented litigants on a
‘Representing yourself’.186 Resources include ‘self-help
information packs’ about starting, defending and
appealing a legal
action.187 Litigants can contact and make appointments with the Court’s
specialist self-represented litigant
coordinator who ‘is available to
assist self-represented litigants with procedural advice, information about
alternative dispute
resolution, organisations that provide low cost legal
services and self-help packs on various types of proceedings’.188
6.142 However, the
Access to Justice
report identified that
self-represented litigants in higher courts still experience disadvantage and
difficulty in navigating the
courts’ complex procedures.
6.143 The Court has the power to waive its fees under
section 129(3)
Supreme Court Act
(Vic) on the basis of financial hardship. A person wishing to
have their fees waived must complete an application form. In the majority
circumstances, fees are only waived for self-represented litigants.189
Alternative dispute resolution and judicial mediation
6.144 The Supreme Court actively encourages the use of ADR to resolve legal
disputes via mediation. The Court also conducts judicial
mediation where this
process would be most efficient in reaching a resolution.190
6.145 The Court may order parties, even where they do not consent, to
undergo mediation at any stage of a proceeding.191 Parties
may also ask the
Court to refer them to a mediator at any stage of a proceeding.192
6.146 Judicial mediation is ordered selectively and ‘is not a
substitute for mediation by appropriately qualified private mediators’.193
Judicial mediation may be ordered in the following circumstances:
• an earlier unsuccessful private mediation
• one or more parties has limited resources
• a substantial risk that the costs and time of a trial would be
disproportionately high compared to the amount in dispute or
the subject matter
of the dispute
• an estimated trial length that would occupy substantial judicial and
other court resources
• aspects that otherwise make it in the interests of justice that the
matter be referred to judicial mediation.194
6.147 The Trial Division of the Court hears and determines cases. Decisions
of the Trial Division can be appealed to the Court of
6.148 The Court of Appeal also has jurisdiction to ‘hear an appeal
against civil judgments made by the County Court and Supreme
Court. The Court
may also hear appeals against civil judgments made by the President or
Vice-President of VCAT.’195

6.149 In almost all matters, a direct right of appeal does not exist,196 and
leave must be granted by the Court.197
Transfer to County Court
6.150 While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all matters, including
tree disputes, research by the Commission has found only
one case of this kind
being heard by the Court in the last 30 years.198 There are very few published
decisions of the Supreme Court
relating to neighbourhood tree disputes.199 It is likely that solicitors
advise clients to initiate in the County Court, as that
court also has unlimited
Supreme Court.
6.151 Cases may be (and would likely be) transferred to the County Court
where, in the opinion of the designated judicial officer:
• the Supreme Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
determine it, and
• the County Court has the appropriate skill, experience and authority
to hear and determine it having regard to its gravity,
difficulty and
importance, and
• it is just and convenient that it be transferred.200
6.152 These considerations are made to further the overall aim to
‘improve efficiency in the administration of civil justice
Victoria’.201
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT)
6.153 VCAT is a tribunal that hears small civil claims. It was established
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998
. VCAT is a ‘modern,
accessible, efficient, cost- effective, and independent judicially-governed
tribunal’.202
6.154 VCAT comprises four main divisions: the Administrative Division, Civil
Division, Human Rights Division and the Residential Tenancies
Division. Claims
brought before VCAT can be monetary and non-monetary in nature.
6.155 The Civil Division, in which disputes over matters such as consumer
issues, domestic building works, and retail tenancies are
heard, deals largely
with monetary claims.
6.156 In other divisions such as the Residential Tenancies Division and Human
Rights Division, claims are more likely to be non-monetary
in nature, dealing
with issues such as anti- discrimination, tenancy or guardianship.203
6.157 VCAT derives its jurisdiction to hear and determine claims in these
specialised areas from various statutes.204
6.158 Although VCAT is known to handle smaller civil claims,205 there is no
limit on the amount that can be claimed in the Civil
Division.206 Even more
complex claims over the value of
$100,000 can be heard in VCAT.207

2015–16 (2016) 33. This presents an overlap between the VCAT and
Magistrates’ Court jurisdictions. This is discussed in
further detail
below at [6.183] – [6.186].
6.159 VCAT is headed by a president who is a judge of the Supreme Court of
Victoria. VCAT also has 13 vice-presidents who are judges
from the County Court
of Victoria. The president and vice-presidents are responsible for the
management and administration of VCAT.
6.160 Claims are determined by members who ‘have specialist knowledge
and qualifications’, most of whom also have a legal
background.208
6.161 VCAT deals with a high volume of matters and is significantly less
formal than the courts.
VCAT’s website states that it is the busiest tribunal of its kind in
Australia, finalising
87,448 matters in the 2015–16 financial year.209
6.162 Fees to bring a claim at VCAT are significantly lower than in the
courts, with most areas applying a sliding scale depending
on the amount in
dispute. VCAT revised its fees in July
2016, making it more affordable.
Access to Justice
report found that this ‘new fee
structure adequately meets concerns about the affordability of commencing
applications for small
civil claims’.210 Individuals are charged lower
fees than corporate parties, and those with a health-care concession card
often have their fees waived.211
Subject matter expertise
6.164 As VCAT does not have jurisdiction over common law matters, it does not
currently hear tree disputes.212
6.165 However, VCAT does have substantial jurisdiction over a number of areas
that intersect with planning, environment and land issues.
Some of the areas in
which VCAT hears matters include:
• disputes over the use or development of land, including applications
relating to
natural resources (including unreasonable flow of water from surrounding
properties), and applications relating to protection of the
environment and
removal of vegetation
• building and construction, including domestic building claims and
applications for injunctions
• land valuation
• disputes about co-owned land and goods under the
Property Law Act
• residential tenancies disputes
• owners corporation disputes.
6.166 As stated above, VCAT has specialist divisions and lists dealing with
specific types of disputes, and its members have, in addition
backgrounds, various types of specialist expertise.213 There were 237 VCAT
members in the 2015–16 financial year.214
6.167 VCAT’s specialist members ‘must possess in-depth and
up-to-date expert knowledge’ of the relevant subject
matter.215 Similar
requirements apply to commissioners of NSWLEC and members of QCAT and RMPAT.

6.168 VCAT’s primary location is in central Melbourne. VCAT also hears
cases in various Magistrates’ Court locations and
local council customer
service offices across metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria.216 VCAT
also sits at the Neighbourhood
Justice Centre in the City of Yarra.217
6.169 VCAT’s processes differ from those of a court.218 On the webpage
entitled ‘Steps to resolve your case’, parties
are informed that
‘VCAT is deliberately less formal than a court and we encourage you to
represent yourself where possible’.219
In fact, parties may only appear
with legal representation in limited circumstances, with VCAT’s
permission.220
6.170 Through VCAT’s website parties can access informative materials
to help guide them through VCAT’s processes. VCAT
has also produced a
video entitled
Taking it to VCAT,
available on YouTube and the VCAT
website. 221 Information about VCAT’s process and procedures is also
available through the
registries and the litigant in person co-ordinator.
Access to Justice
report noted that VCAT’s active case
management is also of assistance to parties. It provides an example of active
case management
in VCAT’s Human Rights List:
once a person has filed their matter, VCAT will serve the documents on the
respondent and, in some cases, contact the parties to discuss
proceeding direct to a compulsory conference or mediation. Alternatively, the
case will be listed for a directions hearing
where VCAT’s processes are
explained and discussed with the parties.222
Alternative dispute resolution
6.172 VCAT uses a range of ADR processes to help parties resolve their
dispute without a full hearing. They are conducted by ‘members,
external mediators from a panel who are engaged on a sessional
6.173 The principal registrar may require parties to undergo compulsory
conferencing, a private and confidential meeting in which
a member will assist
the parties identify the issues in contention, and questions of fact and law.
Compulsory conferences take place
before a hearing and allow the member to take
an active role in helping to resolve the dispute.
If resolution cannot be achieved through the compulsory conference then the
member can issue orders and directions for the final hearing.
Parties do not
incur additional costs for compulsory conferencing.224
6.174 Parties may also, with or without consent, undergo mediation with a
member or accredited mediator. Conversations during mediation
are confidential
and cannot be used in hearings. Mediation may target all the issues in a
proceeding or a subset of them. The mediator
or member’s role is less
active than in compulsory conferencing, as they cannot
‘give advice about a party’s prospects of success’ or
‘put forward options for settlement of the proceeding’.225

Access to Justice
report made recommendations to improve and
expand VCAT’s ADR processes. These include partnering with the Dispute
Centre of Victoria to expand its ADR services and expanding its short
mediation and hearing program, including into regional areas.228
6.178 There is a limited right to appeal VCAT decisions, with most decisions
being final and binding.229 A party may appeal a VCAT
decision to the Supreme
Court but only on questions of law (legal errors).230 This limit on appeals is
designed to provide certainty
and clarity once VCAT makes a determination.
6.179 Parties who wish to appeal a decision made by a VCAT member must seek
leave to appeal a question of law from the Supreme Court.
6.180 Parties who wish to appeal a decision made by the President or
Vice-President of VCAT
must seek leave to appeal a question of law from the Court of Appeal.232
6.181 An application seeking leave to appeal must be made no later than 28
days after VCAT makes an order and in accordance with the
rules of the Supreme
Court.233 VCAT advises parties to seek legal advice or contact the Supreme
Court’s self-represented litigant
coordinator for assistance as soon as
VCAT makes a determination.234
6.182 If leave to appeal is granted then the appeal must be filed in the
Supreme Court within
14 days.235
Concurrent jurisdiction and transfer to the Magistrates’
6.183 VCAT can hear civil claims under $100,000. This coincides with the
damages for breach of contract, other contractual disputes, and claims under the
Australian Consumer Law’.236
6.184 Reasons why a person may elect to bring a matter in VCAT rather than
the Magistrates’ Court include:
• The proceedings are less formal.
• It is easier to bring a claim without legal representation.
• The costs are lower.

to similar claims. For example, VCAT ‘cannot award costs in small civil

awarded to the

VCAT and 1998 Fences Review
6.187 The possibility of conferring jurisdiction to hear neighbourhood
disputes about fences was previously explored in Victoria by
the Parliamentary
Law Reform Committee (a different body from the Victorian Law Reform Commission)
in its 1998 review of the
In its report, the Committee provides useful commentary on its recommendation
that VCAT, rather than the Magistrates’ Court,
should be given power to
hear comparable neighbourhood disputes:
VCAT could perform a larger role in providing an efficient and cost effective
forum for the resolution of a wider range of neighbour
disputes. Consequently,
the Committee recommends the creation of a ‘Neighbour Disputes’
Division of the Tribunal with
the jurisdiction under the proposed Boundaries and
at its core.239
6.188 This recommendation was not, however, implemented. The
government’s 2001 response to this recommendation provides some
The Government ... notes that there are complex issues to be considered in
the relocation of any jurisdiction. In particular, the
Government is concerned
that regional and rural Victoria remain serviced in the comprehensive manner in
which they are currently
serviced by local Magistrates’ courts. It
proposes to consider further the necessity of an entirely new Division at the
and whether broader disputes would be better resolved in another
6.189 The government also stated that if jurisdiction were to be given to
VCAT, then the powers conferred on VCAT ‘would not
be large but limited to
determination of disputes on defined matters under that Act, ensuring that there
was no overlap with building
or planning legislation’. Currently, fencing
disputes are heard in the Magistrates’ Court.
6.190 Whether or not tree disputes should continue to be heard in the
Magistrates’ Court or in another forum is a key consideration
design of a new scheme.
6.191 Stakeholders may wish to take into account the following factors when
considering which jurisdiction should hear tree disputes:
• the cost of proceedings
• the formality of proceedings
• the capacity of parties to participate in proceedings/ability to
represent themselves
• the expertise of the arbiters
• the powers available to the arbiters
• the resources of the court/tribunal
• the location of the court/tribunal.

21 Which court/s or tribunal should have jurisdiction over neighbourhood
tree disputes under a statutory scheme?
(g) Preconditions
6.192 Some preconditions (or ‘jurisdictional facts’) must be met
before a court (or tribunal) can make orders.241
6.193 In New South Wales, the NSWLEC needs to be satisfied that the following
preconditions have been met before making any orders:
• Parties have made a reasonable effort to resolve the dispute among
themselves before commencing an application.242
• Appropriate notice has been given. An affected neighbour must give
the tree owner, local council or any other person likely
to be affected by an
order at least 21 days notice of the lodging of the application and the orders
they wish to seek.243
• The tree concerned has caused or is likely to cause the damage or
harm claimed by the affected neighbour.244
6.194 One of the ways a reasonable effort to reach an agreement may be
demonstrated is by writing to the other party informing them
of any concerns or
engaging in mediation.245
The presence of parties at a hearing may also demonstrate a reasonable effort
in and of itself. Chief Justice Preston in
Robson v Leischke
that this requirement is ‘less demanding than the language used in
provisions of other statutory enactments which
require parties to make
reasonable attempts to reach agreement’246 and that exhaustive negotiation
is not required.247 A reasonable
effort does not need to be made before the
filing of an application but does need to be made before the court makes any
6.195 In order for the tree concerned to have caused or be likely to cause
damage or harm, there must be a relationship between the
tree and the damage or
harm alleged in the application.249 Although the tree does not need to be the
sole cause of the damage or
harm alleged, ‘something more than a
theoretical possibility is required in order to engage the power under [the NSW
Furthermore, the tree itself must be the cause of damage or
harm. Chief Justice Preston explains in
Robson v Leischke
although a tree when it flowers might attract bees seeking nectar in the
flowers, and
the presence of the bees might increase the risk of persons in the vicinity
being stung by bees, it is not the tree itself that is
likely to cause such
injury of bee sting to any person, but rather it is the bees: see
Immarrata v
[2007] NSWLEC 601.
Similarly, the
fact that an animal which has caused, is causing or is likely to cause in the
near future damage to property on adjoining land, uses
a tree as habitat, such
as for feeding, roosting or nesting, does not result in the tree itself having
caused, causing or being likely
to cause in the near future damage to the
applicant’s property:

[2007] NSWLEC 715

question attaches a

6.196 In Queensland, QCAT needs to be satisfied that the following
preconditions have been met before the making of any orders:
• The affected neighbour has made a reasonable effort to reach an
agreement with the tree owner.
• The affected neighbour has taken all reasonable steps to resolve the
issue under any other applicable law or scheme.
• The affected neighbour has provided the tree owner with copies of the
application with at least 21 days notice.
• In the case of overhanging branches, that the branches extend into
the affected neighbour’s land by at least 50 centimetres
and the dispute
cannot be resolved under the
branch removal process.252
6.197 One way a reasonable effort to reach an agreement may be demonstrated
is by writing to the tree owner to request certain works
to be performed on
their tree,253 engaging
in mediation254 or participating in compulsory conferencing ordered by the
Tribunal. A reasonable effort does not need to be made
before an application is
filed but does need to be made before a final decision in a proceeding.255
6.198 In Tasmania, the affected neighbour must give ‘notice in writing
of an application, the grounds of the application and
the nature of the relief
sought’ to the tree owner and any other interested party.256 Additionally,
RMPAT must consider, before
hearing an application, whether ‘reasonable
attempts to resolve the matter ... have been made by the parties’.257
differs from New South Wales and Queensland, where the decision maker must
be satisfied a reasonable effort to resolve the matter
has been made before
making orders.258
6.199 In determining whether a reasonable attempt has been made, RMPAT will
consider whether the notice and request processes set
out in the Tasmanian Act
have been followed, and any refusals to carry out work for reasons of the health
and safety of the tree
or people on the land.259
6.200 If reasonable efforts have not been made, RMPAT ‘may direct the
parties to an application to attempt to resolve the matter’.
In doing so,
RMPAT may take into account whether parties have made any threats of violence;
have successfully obtained orders restraining
any behaviour; or have already
participated in any form of dispute resolution.260
6.201 In Victoria, parties in a dispute being litigated in the
Magistrates’ Court, County Court and Supreme Court are bound
‘overarching obligations’ set out in the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic).261 These overarching obligations place similar emphasis on
attempting to resolve a dispute as the New South Wales, Queensland
and Tasmanian
6.202 Parties have an overarching obligation to:
• use reasonable endeavours to resolve a dispute by agreement if
appropriate, including by appropriate dispute resolution262
• narrow the issues in dispute. If parties cannot resolve a dispute
wholly by agreement then parties must use reasonable endeavours
issues that can be resolved and narrow the scope of remaining issues.263

6.203 Although the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic) applies to all
Victorian courts, it does not apply to matters heard in VCAT.264
6.204 However, if the overarching obligations are not fulfilled, this does
not prevent parties from commencing litigation. As noted
in the 2016
to Justice Review
Civil Procedure Act
, as passed, included a general preaction protocol
that prevented litigants from commencing proceedings (with some limited
exceptions)
before they had taken reasonable steps to resolve the dispute by
agreement, or to clarify and narrow the issues in dispute. Following
a change of
government, those provisions were repealed before the Act commenced, due to
concerns that they would add to the complexity,
costs, and delays of civil
proceedings, and could be used to frustrate proceedings.265
6.205 Any necessary preconditions under a new scheme, and their interaction
Procedure Act 2010
obligations would need to be clearly defined.
22 What preconditions, if any, should parties have to satisfy under a
statutory scheme before any orders are made?
(h) Decision-making factors
6.206 The New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmanian Acts require the decision
makers to take certain factors into account when coming
to a decision. Decision
makers in New South Wales and Queensland
consider all of these
factors.266 In Tasmania, decision makers must consider these factors but only to
the extent that they are relevant.267
6.207 Factors to be considered which are common to all three Acts
• contribution the tree makes to the local ecosystem and to
biodiversity
• public amenity of the tree
• impact of works such as pruning to the health of the tree
• soil stability, the water table or other natural features of the land
or locality
• local laws and Acts, and what consent is needed
• type of tree and whether it is native, protected or considered a
• seasonal changes
• contribution to natural landscape, privacy and protection from
natural elements.
6.208 Decision makers in each of these jurisdictions are not limited to these
factors and are able to consider other factors they
consider relevant.
6.209 Factors to be considered in each jurisdiction are set out below.268

6.210 By way of further guidance, the Queensland Act explains that a
tree’s ‘historical, cultural, social or scientific
includes whether the tree comes under the
Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act
Torres Strait Islander Cultural Heritage Act 2003
situated in a Queensland heritage place under the
Queensland Heritage Act
269The Queensland Act also states that ‘no financial value or
carbon trading value may be placed on a tree’.270
6.211 The Queensland and Tasmanian Acts set out some additional factors that
be considered by the decision makers in particular circumstances,
such as claims about injury, damage or unreasonable interference,
deciding to order the destruction of a tree. The decision maker is not bound to
consider all these additional factors.
6.212 In relation to claims about injury, damage or unreasonable
interference, the decision maker
• whether anything other than the tree has contributed, or is
contributing, to the injury or damage or likelihood of injury
including any act or omission by the neighbour and the impact of any tree
situated on the neighbour’s land
• any steps taken by the tree-keeper or the neighbour to prevent or
rectify the injury or damage or the likelihood of injury
6.213 In relation to claims concerning substantial, ongoing and unreasonable
interference with the use and enjoyment of the neighbour’s
decision maker
• anything other than the tree that has contributed, or is
contributing, to the interference
• any steps taken by the tree-keeper or the neighbour to prevent or
minimise the interference
• the size of the neighbour’s land
• whether the tree existed before the neighbour acquired the land.
6.214 The Tasmanian Act goes on to state that the decision maker may also
consider any other matter considered to be relevant.271
6.215 In relation to orders for the destruction of a tree, the decision maker
• how long the neighbour has known of the injury or damage
• any steps that have been taken by either neighbour to prevent further
injury or damage
• anything other than the tree that may have caused, or contributed to,
some or all of the injury or damage
• any other matter considered to be relevant.272
6.216 As can be seen in Table 2, some of the general factors from New South
Wales have been replicated in the later Queensland Act.
Most of the general and
specific factors from
the Queensland Act have then been replicated in the more recent Tasmanian
Act. These factors may provide a basis from which to model
any similar factors
in Victoria. However, as reflected by differences in the existing state Acts,
there may also be unique factors
relevant to Victoria that should be taken into
account by the decision maker.
Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing Fences and Trees) Act 2011
s 73(1)(c).
Neighbourhood Disputes About Plants Act 2017
23 What factors should be taken into account by the decision maker before
making any determinations under a statutory scheme?
24 Should there be a hierarchy or relative weight for each of these
factors? If so, how should this be determined?
(i) Types of orders and enforcement
6.217 The NSW Act sets out the types of order that the NSWLEC can make in
tree disputes.273
The NSWLEC has broad jurisdiction to make ‘such orders as it thinks fit
to remedy, restrain or prevent’ and it is not
limited to orders requested
by the parties.274 Examples of such orders include:
• seasonal or annual maintenance works
• authorisation to enter land to carry out work or obtain quotations
• payment of costs of works
• payment of compensation
• replacement of trees ordered to be removed.275
6.218 Payment of compensation is only available for claims based on
damage.276 The NSWLEC cannot make orders as to costs277—parties
instead file a Notice of Motion that would be heard by a Registrar or judge of
the court.278
6.219 Failure to comply with an order is an offence with a maximum of 1000
penalty units.279
On the request of the affected neighbour, local council may also arrange for
an authorised person to enter the tree owner’s
land to ascertain whether
any orders relating to tree works have been carried out and, if not, arrange for
the works to be carried
out. The local council must give a signed notice to the
tree owner that contains details such
as the relevant provisions of the NSW Act, the day the authorised person will
enter and for what purpose.280 The local council can
bring legal action to
recoup any costs incurred for carrying out the order. A judgment debt can be
registered as a charge on the
tree owner’s land.281
6.220 The Queensland Act also sets out the types of orders that can be
made.282 QCAT can make any orders it considers necessary
to remedy, restrain or
prevent. The content of these orders depends on the circumstances of the dispute
and can include orders for:
• annual maintenance work
• a survey to clarify who owns the tree
• a person to enter the tree owner’s land to obtain a quote or to
carry out work
• compensation or repair costs relating to damage caused

• an arborist to check and write a report on the tree
• removal of the tree.283
6.221 If QCAT orders the removal of a tree, it can also make orders for the
replacement of the tree with a more appropriate tree of
different maturity or
species and, if appropriate, for it to be placed in a more appropriate location
on the tree owner’s land.284
6.222 QCAT can make orders to compensate the affected neighbour for damage,
even if the tree has already been completely removed.
However, QCAT can not do
so in respect of a tree completely removed if the tree owner has since sold the
6.223 Each party in a QCAT matter must bear their own costs. QCAT usually
does not make orders as to costs except where it ‘considers
the interests
of justice require it’.286 QCAT may consider factors set out in the
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(Qld) in coming to
a decision.287
6.224 If the tree owner fails to follow an order without reasonable excuse,
they can be held liable for an offence with a maximum
of 1000 penalty
6.225 Like the Act, the Queensland Act also provides a ‘last
resort’ enforcement mechanism through local council in the
case where the
tree owner fails to carry out a QCAT order. The affected neighbour can contact
their local council and ask that it
carry out the order because the tree owner
has failed to do so. The local council is under no obligation to follow this
request.289
6.226 In its statutory review of the Queensland Act, the Queensland Law
Reform Commission (QLRC) reported that this mechanism is not
frequently used but
‘considers it appropriate for the [Queensland] Act to continue to include
provisions to allow a local [council]
to carry out work under a tree order if
the tree-keeper has failed to comply, particularly for cases where the tree
poses a significant
danger’.290
6.227 The QLRC also stated that the non-obligatory nature of this mechanism
should be retained because it ‘is concerned that,
if assistance were made
obligatory, local [councils] would need to establish new procedures with
additional attendant expenses, which
may have unintended
implications’.291
6.228 In Tasmania, the tribunal can make orders in relation to
• ensure that parts of the tree do not overhang
• prevent or reduce the likelihood of a serious injury
• prevent, restrain or reduce the likelihood of serious damage
• prevent or reduce the likelihood of substantial, ongoing and
unreasonable interference
• remedy damage caused to a person’s land or any property on that
6.229 Parties to a proceeding in RMPAT must bear their own costs. However,
as in QCAT, RMPAT can make orders as to costs if it considers
it ‘fair and
reasonable’.293 The
Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal
sets out factors RMPAT may take into consideration in coming to a
decision.294

6.230 Specific examples of these types of orders include:
• compelling the tree owner to carry out final or ongoing tree
• requiring a survey to be undertaken to clarify the tree’s
position in relation to a boundary line
• requiring an application for consent from a relevant authority
• authorising the entry of a person onto land to carry out an order
• requiring the tree owner to pay the costs of carrying out an order or
pay the affected neighbour compensation for damage
• requiring a report to be obtained from an appropriately qualified
arborist.295
6.231 The Tasmanian Act does not set out penalties for parties who fail to
follow RMPAT’s orders.296 Where an order is not
complied with, the
aggrieved party may take legal action for non-compliance in the Civil Division
of the Tasmanian Magistrates’
6.232 Consideration must be given to appropriate orders and enforcement under
Victorian scheme.
25 What types of orders should be available under a statutory scheme?
26 How should these orders be enforced?
(j) Effect on current law
6.233 As described in Chapter 3, the resolution of tree disputes is governed
by tort law, with neighbours relying primarily on the
common law self-help
remedy of abatement, and seeking relief under the law of nuisance.
6.234 As described in Chapter 4, trees on private land may be subject to
environment and planning legislation as well as local laws.
6.235 It is therefore important to consider how a new scheme would interact
with torts, such as nuisance, as well as how orders issued
decision-making body in relation to a tree dispute would interact with
environment and planning legislation and local laws.
6.236 Approaches in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania are explored
below and provide examples of possible approaches.
Nuisance and abatement
6.237 The NSW Act abolishes the right to bring common law actions in nuisance
in relation to tree disputes that fall under the remit
of the Act.298
Robson v Leischke,
299 Chief Justice Preston noted,
however, that this provision does not affect other common law actions such as
trespass and negligence.
He stated that despite the provision barring nuisance
claims, the NSW Act:
295 Ibid s 33(6). Orders that the tribunal can make are not limited to these

[218] – [219].
contains no limitation on bringing common law actions in trespass or
negligence, regardless of whether the tree concerned is one
to which the [Act]
applies. The Land
and Environment Court, however, has no original jurisdiction to hear and
determine such common law actions, nor would such actions
be ancillary to a
matter that falls within jurisdiction such as an application under the [Act] but
rather are separate causes of
6.239 Furthermore, Chief Justice Preston stated that ‘if the damage
is caused by a tree to which the NSW Act does not apply’,
such as a tree
on land outside permitted zones or on public land, then ‘a common law
action in nuisance can still be brought’.300
6.240 Although an affected neighbour cannot bring a claim for nuisance in
respect of a tree that is captured by the NSW Act, they
can still exercise the
self-help remedy of abatement. However, it has been noted that an affected
neighbour’s ability to abate
may be significantly limited, due to the prevalence of local council tree
protection orders which require not only the local council’s
but also the
tree owner’s consent to remove encroaching parts.301
6.241 In Queensland, nuisance claims are not prohibited under the Queensland
Act in the explicit manner of the NSW Act. However, the
actions available under
the Queensland Act, such as for the ‘substantial, ongoing and unreasonable
interference with the neighbour’s
use and enjoyment of the land’,302
are underpinned by general principles of nuisance303 and are likely to make
reliance on
separate nuisance actions an unattractive option.
6.242 Abatement is still available to affected neighbours in Queensland,
although it has been modified to the extent that the affected
neighbour is no
longer required to return the removed parts of the tree to the tree
6.243 In some cases, the common law remedy of abatement is displaced by the
process set out in Part 4 of Chapter 3 of the Queensland Act. The Part 4
removal process comprises four main aspects.
6.244 First, it is available only where overhanging branches are at least 50
centimetres long
and a maximum of 2.5 metres above the ground.305 In its review of the
Queensland Act, the QLRC explained that ‘overhanging branches
that are 2.5
metres or less above the ground may impede the passage of a person or vehicle.
It is also a lower and safer height range
to carry out the work of cutting and
removing the branches’ and that a depth of
50 centimetres provides a ‘reasonable balance between the right of a
neighbour to have uninterrupted use of their property,
and the burden that a
tree-keeper may experience as a result of the ongoing need to trim or lop trees
close to the boundary.’306
6.245 Secondly, an affected neighbour must give the tree owner notice that
they seek removal.
The notice must:
• state the day by which the branches must be removed (at least 30 days
from the date of the notice)
• ask for at least one day’s written notice of the date on which
the branches are scheduled to be removed and notice of
who will do the work

, Report No 72 (2015) [3.295] ,
• give permission to the tree owner or their contractor to enter the
affected neighbour’s land on the agreed day between
8am and 5pm
• include at least one written quote for the cost of the work
• include a copy of Part 4 of the Queensland Act which deals with
overhanging branches.
6.246 A pre-drafted government form is available which satisfies these notice
requirements.307
6.247 Thirdly, the onus for arranging the works is on the tree owner and
costs are incurred by the tree owner. If the tree owner refuses
to comply, or
does not remove the encroaching branches by the specified time, the affected
neighbour can remove the branches themselves
or via a contractor at the tree
owner’s expense. Tree owners are liable to pay up to $300 a year for the
removal of branches
from their tree.308
6.248 Fourthly, an affected neighbour exercising this right by removing an
overhanging branch is not required to return the removed
part to the tree
6.249 The Tasmanian Act largely mirrors the Queensland Act’s implied
limitation on nuisance claims and its notice provisions
for the removal of
overhanging branches.309 The Tasmanian Act process for non-compliance differs
slightly from Queensland, and the
Act provides additional notice requirements
for other tree works that are not branch removal.310
6.250 An affected neighbour who abates the nuisance caused by the tree is no
longer required to return any severed parts of the tree
to the tree owner.311 If
the parts intended to be abated are branches that are at least 50 centimetres
long and a maximum of 2.5
metres above the ground, then a ‘branch removal
notice’ must be given to the tree owner. The form and process of
the tree owner with this notice mirrors Queensland’s
Part 4 removal process.312
6.251 The Tasmanian Act also states that a branch removal notice concerning
the same tree cannot be issued to the same tree owner
within the 12-month period
after the day the previous notice was given.313
6.252 If the tree owner does not comply with the notice, then the affected
neighbour may remove the overhanging branches themselves.
Although they do not
need to return the branches to the tree owner, they are not prohibited from
6.253 The affected neighbour is entitled to recoup reasonable expenses
incurred in the removal of the branches as a debt owed to
them by the tree
owner but only up to a maximum prescribed amount. If the tree owner takes issue
with the amount of the debt, they
may apply to have the issue heard and determined by a magistrate. The
magistrate can determine that another amount should be owed
if the original
amount is ‘not fair and reasonable’ up to the prescribed
maximum.314

6.254 If other parts of the tree that do not come under the branch removal
provisions are affecting a neighbour, then the affected
neighbour ‘may
give notice in writing’ to the tree owner outlining the ways the tree is
affecting their land or property
and how it should
be remedied. The notice must also request that the tree owner respond to the
notice in writing within a period of not less than 14
Legislation and local laws
6.255 Chapter 4 sets out how trees on private land may be affected by local
laws and other legislation in Victoria.
6.256 In New South Wales, orders made by the NSWLEC can override local laws
such as tree protection orders or any other permission
required by local
councils. However, permission required under legislation cannot be
overridden.316
6.257 Copies of orders are provided to the local council and other relevant
authorities via
a standard letter from the NSWLEC.317 This letter also informs the local
council ‘of its obligations [under the
Environmental Planning and
Assessment Act 1979
(NSW)] to make the appropriate notation [of the order]
on the database for planning certificates’.318
6.258 The 2009 statutory review of the NSW Act recommended that notations on
planning certificates should be deleted or amended when
the work ordered is
finally completed (but not for work which is of an ongoing nature, eg
maintenance orders).319
6.259 Similarly, in Queensland, orders made by QCAT can override local
laws to the contrary, such as the need for consent of the
local council or tree
owner before undertaking any work on a protected tree.320 However, QCAT cannot
make an order for work on a
tree that is prohibited by or contrary to
legislation.321
6.260 QCAT must give the local council or any other relevant authority that
appears in a proceeding a copy of any order it makes.322
6.261 The Tasmanian Act does not allow RMPAT to make orders that would be
unlawful under legislation. However, unlike New South Wales
and Queensland, it
also does not allow local laws, such as those that require local council
permission for certain works, to be overridden.323
6.262 The Second Reading Speech for the Tasmanian Act explains:
Parties who are seeking redress under the Bill will be required to obtain the
relevant permit from the planning authority in the first
instance, or if the
permit has not been obtained when the matter comes before the Tribunal, the
Tribunal may put a stay on proceedings
in order to enable the relevant permit to
be obtained. In this way, the bill retains the current policy settings for
decision-making
under other legislative regimes, including notification and
rights of appeal.324
6.263 As set out in Table 2, in all jurisdictions, the question of permission
is taken into account when coming to a decision. In
New South Wales and
Queensland, if permission is required, then this consideration is weighed
against the issuing of an order in
favour of the aggrieved neighbour.325

27 Should the common law right of abatement remain available to affected
neighbours under a statutory scheme? Should it be modified
in any way?
28 To what extent, if any, should orders made under a statutory scheme
override or modify:
(a) local laws?
(b) other legislation?
(k) Expert evidence
6.264 Proving in court that damage or harm has been caused by a particular
tree or group of trees, often requires an expert opinion.
This may be given by a
variety of experts, in the form of a written report or oral evidence in a court
or tribunal (‘expert
evidence’).
6.265 Expert evidence is given in court proceedings by expert witnesses who
have ‘specialised knowledge’ based on their
‘training, study
or experience’.326 Expert evidence in tree disputes, particularly in
relation to large trees, trees
with ‘any historical, cultural, social
or scientific value’ and trees that contribute to the ecosystem and to
biodiversity, will likely be given by arborists.327
Expert evidence from
structural engineers, horticulturalists, botanists and plumbers has also been
given in court.328
6.266 Because an expert has been contracted by either the affected neighbour
or tree owner, there is a risk that their expert reports
and evidence may
contain an ‘adversarial bias’.329
This bias may result in divergent reports between parties’
experts.330
6.267 Adversarial bias is not limited to tree disputes, and may arise in any
bias is the reason behind
the trend for courts in many areas to order ‘experts’
conclaves’, or a ‘hot tub’,
in which experts are required to
compare reports, and to produce a joint report detailing what they agree on, and
what they disagree
on, and why. Sometimes they are also required to give
evidence concurrently.
6.268 It is important to consider the obligations and duties expert witnesses
are bound by, the quality of expert reports, and any
practical mechanisms a
decision-making body can employ to reduce adversarial bias.
6.269 The obligations of expert witnesses in civil proceedings in Victorian
courts are discussed below. This is followed by discussion

6.270 The Victorian legislature and the courts have sought to clarify the
duties and obligations of expert witnesses in the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic) and court rules.
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic) applies its overarching
obligations to expert witnesses
in all Victorian courts.332 These include a paramount duty owed to the court
to further the administration of justice,333 as well
as obligations to:
• act honestly at all times334
• not engage in conduct that is, or, is likely to be, misleading or
deceptive335
• narrow down issues in contention.336
6.272 Court rules also seek to reduce adversarial bias of expert witnesses by
setting out their duties and obligations.337 For example,
expert witnesses must
abide by the Code of Conduct found in Form 44A of all Victorian courts’
rules.338 The Code of Conduct
states that an expert witness:
• owes an overriding duty to assist the court impartially
• is not an advocate for a party
• must acknowledge in their report that they have read the Code of
Conduct and agree to be bound by it
• must provide a supplementary report to the court and parties if they
change their opinion on a material matter
• if required by the court, must provide a joint report specifying
matters in agreement and in contention.339
6.273 The Code of Conduct also sets out the required content of expert
reports and supplementary reports.340
6.274 Courts may also issue practice directions about expert witnesses as
6.275 In Victoria, there is no consistent or mandatory industry reporting
standard for arboricultural expert evidence in tree disputes.
Arboriculture Victoria and some local councils have published guidelines for
report writing.342 Arborists may choose to
follow these guidelines.343
6.276 Unlike arborist reports submitted to local councils for the removal of
protected or
council-owned trees, expert evidence in court does not need to be from an
arborist with particular minimum qualifications or expertise.344

the code of conduct set out in Schedule 7 to the
Uniform Civil Procedure
6.279 The Court may direct experts to engage in joint conferencing and to
produce a joint report.346
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal
6.280 The QCAT framework for expert evidence in tree disputes arguably does
more to reduce adversarial bias and encourage a greater
objectivity.
6.281 Although parties are able to engage their own experts to provide expert
evidence, QCAT
practice directions stipulate that:
• Only one expert for each area of expertise is allowed.
• Experts owe a duty to assist QCAT which overrides any obligation to
the party that engages them.
• All experts in a proceeding must participate in an
‘experts’ conclave’ convened by QCAT and produce a joint
report which identifies the matters agreed and disagreed about, and the reasons
for any disagreement. The joint report must be prepared
by the experts without
instruction from the parties.347
6.282 Where parties do not engage their own experts and expert evidence is
required, QCAT will generally appoint an independent expert
tree assessor to
provide expert evidence. Tree assessors are appointed to a panel of casual
appointees, which is reviewed annually,
and receive remuneration from QCAT for
their assessment and reports.348
6.283 The tree assessor is a qualified arborist of ‘Australian
Qualifications Framework Level 5
Diploma in Arboriculture (or verified equivalent), with a minimum of 5
years’ experience in local government tree management,
or private tree
industry tree assessment’.349 QCAT also recommends that its tree
assessors show ‘commitment to continued
professional development through
membership of a professional organisation such as Arboriculture Australia Ltd
and Queensland Arboricultural
Association Inc’.350
6.284 The tree assessor will inspect the tree and the land before providing
QCAT with a report on the possible solutions to the issues
in dispute.351 The
tree assessor may also help each party understand the evidence their conclusions
are based on.352 Parties share
the cost of the tree assessor equally and QCAT
will generally make an order requiring each party to pay half the cost up to a
of $1000.353

If leave is granted,
additional expert witnesses must participate in an experts’ conclave with

Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal
6.286 The Tasmanian Act does not contain any provisions dealing with expert
evidence. As the Act was only recently enacted, RMPAT
has not issued any
comments or practice directions concerning expert evidence specific to tree
disputes. This may change as tree
disputes begin to be brought before RMPAT.
6.287 At the time of writing, RMPAT had issued one general practice direction
concerning expert evidence.355 The key expectations
of expert witnesses and
requirements of their evidence are summarised below.
6.288 Expert witnesses must comply with an Expert Witness Code of Conduct.
The Code of Conduct states that expert witnesses owe
a general duty to RMPAT.
This general duty comprises:
• an overriding duty to assist RMPAT impartially on matters relevant to
their area of expertise
• a paramount duty to RMPAT and not to any party to the proceedings
(including the person retaining the expert witness)
• the requirement that an expert witness is not to advocate for a
6.289 The Code of Conduct also sets out the required content of expert
evidence—that experts are expected to work cooperatively
experts and that they must participate in joint conferencing or produce a joint
report when instructed by RMPAT.
6.290 As soon as an expert is engaged by a party, they must be given a copy
of the Code of Conduct. An expert’s statement or
report cannot be produced
in RMPAT as evidence unless it contains an ‘acknowledgment that the author

(l) New owners of land
6.292 Tree disputes may continue throughout and even after the sale of one of
the properties involved. Buyers of the tree owner’s
land also buy the tree
that is affecting their neighbours. Buyers of the affected neighbour’s
land may also inherit the issues
caused by the neighbouring tree. The New South
Wales, Queensland and Tasmanian schemes set out the legal position of new owners
(successors
in title), where the relevant tree disputes have already been the
subject of legal action.

357 Ibid [12.3(c)].
6.293 The point at which the relevant provisions apply to new owners
differs in each state. In New South Wales, new owners will
be bound by the
outcome of legal action after title to the land has passed to them, whereas in
Queensland and Tasmania, new owners
will be bound by the outcome of legal action
when, as purchasers of land, they enter into a contract of sale. These schemes
explored in more detail below.
6.294 In New South Wales, if ownership of the land passes to another
person before an order for any work on the tree is carried
out, then the new
owner must carry out the order as if they were the original tree owner but only
if they have been served with a
copy of the order by the affected
neighbour.358
6.295 Copies of orders made by the NSWLEC are sent to the affected neighbour
‘with a standard letter advising the [affected
neighbour] of the
provisions ... and, as a consequence, the steps that the [affected neighbour]
must take to ensure that the orders
remain in force if the tree owner sells the
property in which the tree is located’.359
6.296 In its original incarnation, the NSW Act was silent on what should
happen if the affected neighbour’s land passes to a
new owner before an
order is carried out by the tree owner. Following the 2009 statutory review of
the Act, a new provision was enacted,
which now allows immediate new owners of
the affected neighbour’s land to be entitled to the same benefits given to
the original
affected neighbour under the order.360
6.297 The NSW
Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulations 2000
require that where a local council has been informed, its planning
certificates must specify any orders made under the NSW Act. The
2009 statutory
review of the NSW Act found this to be an
‘appropriate safeguard for potential buyers of the
property’.361
6.298 In Queensland, once the purchaser enters into a contract for sale and
has been given a copy of the application, the purchaser
is joined as a party to
the QCAT proceeding.362
6.299 Similarly, once given a copy of an order and after entering into a
contract of sale, the purchaser is bound by the order as
if the purchaser were
the original tree owner to the extent the order has not been carried out. Any
period of time mentioned in the
order for carrying out the required work begins
from the transfer of land.363
6.300 The Queensland Act also sets out the purchaser’s right to
terminate the sale of contract and recoup their deposit if they
have not been
given a copy of the application or order before the transfer of land.364
6.301 QCAT also administers a searchable tree orders register. Any person,
including prospective buyers, can search a property by
its address to see if any
tree on the land is subject to an order.365
6.302 The Tasmanian Act is similar to the Queensland Act. An owner of land,
whether the tree owner or affected neighbour, may be fined
if they fail to
provide purchasers with a copy of any application or order relating to the
land.366 If the purchaser is not notified,
they may terminate the contract of
sale and retrieve their deposit.367

before entering into
a contract for sale, and fails to carry out any works required under the
order before settlement, they remain liable to ensure that
that work is carried
out, despite the fact that they no longer own the property.368
6.304 If an application before RMPAT has not yet been determined, then a
purchaser who enters into a contract of sale must be joined,
practicable, as a party to an application of which they have been notified and
given a copy.369 A fine is applicable
if this is not done.
6.305 Local councils are to be informed of any orders, and ‘information
certificates’ about the tree to which the orders
relate are to be provided
to prospective purchasers of land by the council, as explained in the Second
Reading Speech:
These provisions will ensure that prospective purchasers of land on which
problem plants are situated are aware that matters relating
to plants may need
to be dealt with in the future. This will also ensure that landholders who are
affected by a plant will not, in
most cases, be required to seek fresh orders if the owner of the plant fails
to fulfil his or her obligations under the order before
selling the
property.370
6.306 The Tasmanian Act also provides for a publicly available database of
orders and applications, maintained by RMPAT. Information
will ‘include
the terms of the order, when the order takes effect, when any work is required
to be carried out and who is
required to carry out the work’.371 This
information is to be made available on the database within 14 days after an
is made.372 Any member of the community can search the database
for a fee.373

(m) Enhancing useability
6.308 A statutory scheme for resolving tree disputes could be complemented by
supplementary materials and tools to help people to
understand the law, identify
their rights and responsibilities, navigate the available options and in some
cases, resolve their dispute
before taking legal action.
6.309 Easily accessible online resources and information, and online dispute
resolution (ODR) techniques are some of the ways in which
the useability of a
statutory scheme could be enhanced.
6.310 Resources and information currently available to community members in
New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania are set out below
at [6.311] –
[6.319]. The possible use of ODR for resolving tree disputes is explored at
[6.320] – [6.333].
Resources and information
6.311 The schemes in New South Wales and Queensland aim to equip people to
represent themselves and so are complemented by a variety
of publicly available
online resources.
6.312 The NSWLEC has published particularly useful resources for neighbours
seeking information and guidance. These include:
• an annotated version of the NSW Act containing explanatory case law
and examples374
• information sheets375
• step-by-step guides, setting out the Court’s process376
• information about how to prepare applications.377
6.313 The Court also, from time to time, publishes tree dispute principles to
promote consistent decision making.378
6.314 The Queensland Government and QCAT websites are particularly useful
resources for neighbours seeking information and guidance.
The government
webpage entitled
‘Disputes about fences, trees and buildings’379 sets out
resources such as step-by-step guides to resolving and avoiding
disputes.380
6.315 QCAT has published informative fact sheets and practice
directions381 and administers a searchable tree orders register
where people
can search for a property or the name of a party to a tree dispute to see if any
orders against trees on the land have
been made.382
6.316 The QCAT application is supported by an application checklist to help
applicants correctly complete the form and determine whether
their tree dispute
falls under the remit of the Queensland Act.383

Online dispute resolution
6.320 As the information and resources on tree disputes in Australian
benefits of
online dispute resolution (ODR) are also starting to be recognised.
6.321 ODR is a general term, describing a range of technology-assisted forms
of dispute resolution. The styles of ODR are outlined
Online dispute resolution techniques range from methods where parties have
full control of the procedure, such as in an online negotiation,
where a neutral third party is in control of both the process and the outcome,
such as online arbitration. In online dispute
resolution, the information
management role is often carried out not by physical persons, but by computers
and software.385
6.322 There is no one format of ODR, with each jurisdiction that uses it
employing a different range of ODR tools in combination with
traditional
methods. Some examples of this include:
• self-navigated ‘smart forms’ and interactive tools for
exploring options and solutions
• technologically assisted problem diagnosis
• automated negotiation tools
• password-protected online chat platforms
• assisted mediation and arbitration
• online adjudication.
6.323 ODR is generally used for smaller, simpler disputes, which can be
‘triaged’ with threshold questions, and potentially
resolved with
good quality information and tools. In its 2008
Civil Justice Review, the Commission noted that ‘online ADR is an
important development with considerable potential for wider
use, including by
parties who may be distant from each other and the court’.386 Some of the
benefits of ODR methods include:

• Accessibility: Those in non-metro areas, or without access to a
physical court or tribunal may find it easier to interact
with online tools and
processes. ODR tools may also be available around the clock, meaning that
parties need not be in the same place
at the same time to participate in
resolving their dispute.
• Physical removal of parties: In some cases, being in a room together,
as is usually the case in traditional mediation, can
exacerbate the problem. In
ODR, there is no need to meet or speak with the other party.
• Lower cost: The cost to the user (parties) is generally much lower,
as is the cost of resource use by the relevant tribunal
or decision maker. An
increase in settlement before hearing as a result of successful ODR would also
represent a significant decrease
in costs otherwise incurred.
• Ease of use: Assuming a certain level of technological literacy, ODR
systems are generally simple and user-friendly.
• Enforceable orders: Agreements made through ODR may be able to be
simply converted into consent orders by the relevant decision
• Secure and documented communications: Conducting negotiations online
provides better opportunities to accurately record and
document each stage of
the process.
6.324 One of the most successful examples of ODR is the Civil Resolution
Tribunal (CRT) in British Columbia, Canada, which deals with
debts, personal
property disputes, enforcement of specific performance, strata title disputes,
some personal injury disputes, among
others. The CRT uses a cumulative model of
ODR, offering different levels of support if disputes cannot be resolved. The
CRT process
is discussed in more detail at [5.96] – [5.100].
6.325 An ODR pilot program was conducted in the NSW Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (NCAT) in 2014. Intended as an ‘innovative
and convenient
web-based tool for parties in dispute to negotiate online without the need to
attend NCAT in person’, the pilot
focused on selected, single-issue
consumer disputes under the value of $5000.387
6.326 Parties were invited to participate on a voluntary basis, and the
matters were concurrently listed for conciliation and hearing,
presumably to
ensure that no time was lost and the parties were not at a disadvantage should
the ODR mechanism not prove successful.
Parties were then guided by automated
software through the identification of issues
and priorities, the joint development of solutions and the generation of a
negotiated agreement. If the parties reached an agreement,
it would be converted
into a consent order. Where no agreement was reached, the matter would proceed
to hearing on the scheduled
6.327 Feedback from this pilot was generally positive, and showed that:
• 65 per cent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that ODR was
convenient and that they would use it again.
• 63 per cent agreed or strongly agreed that the ODR website was easy
to access and use.
6.328 Analysis of the uptake of matters included in the pilot showed an
increase in finalisations before hearing, an increase in resolutions
at hearing,
a reduction of adjournments at hearing, and an overall projected saving of 12
hearing days per month.389
6.329 It is unclear whether the NCAT pilot will be extended to deal with
other areas of civil dispute, or whether other New South
Wales jurisdictions
such as NSWLEC will introduce ODR methodology.

6.330 In Victoria, following the
Access to Justice
report, the
Victorian Government has pledged almost $800,000 to establish an online dispute
resolution system for the resolution
of small civil claims in VCAT. This is intended to serve as a pilot program
to gauge the suitability of broader introduction of ODR
in Victoria.390 The
review also recommended
the establishment of an online dispute resolution advisory panel. ODR is
currently in use in
Victoria for some Worksafe dispute resolutions.391
6.331 For neighbourhood tree disputes, ODR tools may be useful in providing
structure and clarity in the resolution process, and could
be particularly
complementary to a statutory scheme outlining rights and responsibilities.
6.332 An ODR system may also be a valuable way to link up existing tools and
sources of information, as parties could move through
the dispute resolution in
a guided, linear way, and be given access to the information that best suited
their dispute, as is the
case in the CRT in British Columbia.
6.333 ODR tools may be delivered by the court or tribunal with jurisdiction
to determine disputes or by a body independent of the
adjudication process such
as a government agency or community organisation. The delivery of ODR for
neighbourhood tree disputes would
depend on the applicable
pilot proposed under the
Access to Justice
report, or the
Magistrates’ Court. An ODR neighbourhood tree disputes website could be
hosted by the Victorian Government under
the auspices of the DSCV, or by
Victoria Legal Aid Legal.
37 Should an online dispute resolution platform dedicated to neighbourhood
tree disputes be introduced in Victoria? If so, what tools
should be made
available on this platform and who should administer it?
Other features
6.334 Introducing a new scheme for resolving tree disputes in Victoria would
require careful consideration of a number of factors.
Many of these have been
set out above in parts (a) to (m), with examples of approaches from New South
Wales, Queensland and Tasmania.
6.335 The Commission is aware that this list may not be exhaustive and that
there may be further issues relevant to the Victorian
context that require
consideration.
38 Are there any other specific features of a statutory scheme that
Commission should consider?

Option 3: An alternative option for reform
6.336 The above options and elements were selected from the range of
approaches that emerged out of the Commission’s cross-jurisdictional
review of common law and legislative responses to tree disputes.
6.337 The Commission welcomes proposals for alternative options. Alternative
options for reform could be an entirely different option,
not considered above,
or an amalgam of elements from the current Victorian system and other
6.338 Any proposal must address the key question for the Commission’s
review, which is how tree disputes can be resolved in
simpler, clearer and
fairer ways.

see introduced in Victoria?
7. Conclusion
7.1 This consultation paper sets out the law and process in Victoria for
resolving disputes between neighbours about trees on private
land. It also
canvasses other Australian and international approaches, and presents options
for change.
7.2 The Commission now invites submissions from all parts of the community,
in particular from people who have been involved in a
neighbourhood tree
dispute. Any information about navigating the dispute resolution system, and
suggestions for improvements, will
be of great assistance to the Commission in
recommending whether and how the law should change.
7.3 The Commission invites people’s views on the specific questions
raised in this paper.
A complete list of questions can be found on pages xi–xiii. Responses
may include all questions, or may answer only those in
which the person has an
interest or has had relevant experience. Submissions may be made in many forms,
including by letter, by email,
by telephone or in person, should that be
required. In addition, the Commission
has created a shorter online survey, which is based on the options presented
in this paper. The survey can be accessed at:
www.surveymonkey.com/r/treedisputes.
7.4 In accordance with the terms of reference, set out on page vii, the
Commission will not be considering disputes about trees on
public land, or
disputes relating to access to sunlight
7.5 To allow the Commission adequate time to consider your views before
deciding on final recommendations, submissions are due by
28 February 2018.
