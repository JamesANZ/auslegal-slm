IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL
OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY
OF AUSTRALIA
v Yovanovic
[2024] NTCCA 3
No. CA 8 of 2023 (22129564 & 22126844)
DANNY YOVANOVIC
CORAM: GRANT CJ, BROWNHILL & BURNS JJ
REASONS FOR DECISION
on 29 February 2024)
[1] This is an
appeal against an order permanently staying criminal proceedings against the
respondent in the exercise of the court’s
inherent jurisdiction. Section
414(1)(e) of the
Criminal Code 1983
(NT) provides an avenue of appeal
from that determination. This Court has power under that provision either to
dismiss the appeal
or to set aside the stay order and direct that the
proceedings continue. The sole ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred
in ordering a permanent stay of proceedings.
respondent was charged by indictment dated 4 November 2022 with the commission
of 16 offences against two separate complainants.
[3] In relation
to the first complainant, the respondent was charged with one count of exposing
a child to an indecent film (count
1), and one count of performing an act of
gross indecency on a child without consent (count 2). The indictment pleaded
offences took place at some time during the course of 2008.
[4] In relation
to the second complainant, the respondent was charged with seven counts of
performing an act of gross indecency without
consent (counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12
and 16), and seven counts of sexual intercourse without consent (counts 7, 8, 9,
11, 13, 14 and
15). The indictment pleaded that those offences took place at
some time between 1 December 2013 and 30 June 2015.
[5] On 21 June
2023, the judge at first instance ordered a permanent stay of proceedings of
those counts charging offences against
the first complainant: see
Yovanovic v
[2023] NTSC 53.
The basis for the stay was said to be that the
respondent could not be given a fair trial due to the fact that a child forensic
interview between the first complainant and police which was conducted in 2008
relatively shortly after the incidents in question,
and which was likely to
contain exculpatory material, was missing and could not be found.
application or order was made in relation to those counts charging offences
against the second complainant.
appellant submits that the determination made by the judge at first instance was
evaluative rather than discretionary in nature,
and so attracts the application
of the ‘correctness standard’ explained in
Warren v Coombes
[1979] HCA 9
(1979) 142 CLR 531
at 552. The recent decision of the High Court in
The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Diocese of Lismore
[2023] HCA 32
97 ALJR 857
establishes that the
House v The King
standard no
longer has application to an appeal against a decision to grant a permanent
stay, at least in the civil jurisdiction.
Subsequent decisions of the New South
Wales and Victorian Courts of Appeal have determined that the principle
expressed in
also has application to the grant of a permanent stay in
criminal proceedings: see
Koschier v R
[2024] NSWCCA 24
Haris (a pseudonym) v The King (No 2)
[2024] VSCA 9
respondent accepts that to be so.
consequence of those determinations is that it falls to the appellate court to
consider whether the judge at first instance
was wrong in fact and/or law and,
if so, to give effect to its own judgment, rather than interfering only if the
exercise of the
discretion has miscarried. However, for the reasons which
follow, that distinction is of little significance in the resolution of
authorities clearly establish that proceedings will only be permanently stayed
in an ‘extreme or exceptional case’:
Jago v District Court of
New South Wales
[1989] HCA 46
(1989) 168 CLR 23
R v Glennon
[1992] HCA 16
(1992) 173 CLR
at 605-606;
Agar v Hyde
(2000) 201 CLR 552 at [57]; and
[2010] HCA 20
(2010) 241 CLR 237
, [35]. The court must be satisfied
that there is a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial of such a
nature that
there is nothing the court could do to relieve against its unfair
consequence. Although the categories of case in which the permanent
criminal prosecution might be ordered are not closed, it is a step which has
been described as ‘exceptional’
and ‘rarely justified’:
Strickland (a pseudonym) v Commonwealth Director of Public
Prosecutions
[2018] HCA 53
(2018) 266 CLR 325
. In making such a determination,
fairness to the accused must be balanced against the substantial public interest
of having those
charged with criminal offences brought to trial: see
[2010] HCA 20
(2010) 241 CLR 237
[2016] NSWCCA 84
[9] The relevant
test is whether the continuation of the proceedings would necessarily and
inevitably involve unacceptable injustice
or unfairness: see
(1993) 177 CLR 378 at 392;
R v Edwards
[2009] HCA 20
(2009) 255 ALR 399
. There must be nothing a trial judge could do in the conduct of the
trial which would relieve against its unfair consequences: see
Dupas v The
[2010] HCA 20
(2010) 241 CLR 237
R v Glennon
[1992] HCA 16
(1992) 173 CLR 592
at 605-606.
[10] In the
circumstances of this particular case, police conducted two child forensic
interviews with the first complainant in 2008.
The first interview was
conducted when she was six years and eight months of age, and the second
interview was conducted when she
was seven years and one month of age. The
video recording and verified transcript of the first interview and detailed
contemporaneous
notes remain available. The video recording and transcript of
the second interview is unavailable, but there are some accompanying
notes which
were made contemporaneously by the interviewing police officer. The notes of
that second interview disclose what the
defence maintains are inconsistencies
with the account given in the first interview. Police determined not to charge
the accused
following the conduct of the second interview.
[11] A third
interview was conducted with the first complainant after she had achieved
adulthood, when she was 20 years of age. That
third interview also contains
what the defence maintains are inconsistencies with both the first interview and
the details recorded
in the notes of the second interview. The accused was not
charged with the offences subsequently reflected in counts 1 and 2 of
indictment until 2021, following the conduct of the third interview.
circumstances of this case can be distinguished from cases such as
, in which the prosecution had derived a forensic advantage by
reason of unlawful conduct on the part of the Australian Crime Commission,
Holmden v Bitar
(1987) SASR 509
, in which quarantine officers had
destroyed the product the importation of which was alleged to constitute the
offence before it
could be tested to determine whether the material was
prohibited. In the present case, there has been no unlawful or deliberate
conduct on the part of law enforcement officers. Although misconduct of that
of a stay, it will more
frequently give rise to incurable defect: see, for example,
[2002] EWCA Crim 2836
[13] This case
may also be distinguished from the circumstances considered in
[2007] EWCA Crim 691
, on which the judge at first instance placed considerable
reliance. In that case, an application made by the complainant for criminal
injuries compensation, together with the original investigating officer’s
relevant notebook, had been destroyed as a result
of a delay between the
incident in question and the arrest and charge of the accused. They constituted
the sole objective and contemporaneous
documents with the potential to establish
a suggestion that the complainant had falsified her account of sexual assault.
An application
for a stay was refused, but the verdicts of guilty were
subsequently set aside on appeal. The Court of Appeal observed that this
one of the rare cases where any prejudice flowing from the loss of that evidence
could not be cured by jury direction.
[14] This case
may also be distinguished from the circumstances considered in
[1995] FCA 1321
(1995) 81 A Crim R 156.
In that case, allegations of indecent assault during
the conduct of vaginal examinations were made against a medical practitioner.
The incidents were alleged to have taken place some 15 years prior to the
matters being reported to police. In the intervening
period, the accused had
retired from medical practice and his medical records had been destroyed by his
secretary. The unavailability
of those records constituted a special prejudice
because they were the only objective and contemporaneous means by which it could
be determined whether the accused had seen the complainant and conducted
internal examinations on each of the occasions alleged,
and the only means by
which the accused could reasonably be able to provide instructions to his
counsel about the circumstances giving
rise to each of the allegations.
[15] The present
matter is not such a case. The video recording and transcript of the first
child forensic interview remain available,
as does the recording of the
interview conducted with the first complainant as an adult. Although the notes
made during the course
of the second child forensic interview are not a
substitute for the recording or transcript of the interview, they are sufficient
to identify matters which might be said by the defence to be inconsistent with
the first and third interviews, or otherwise exculpatory.
In particular, the
notes of the second interview describe the general nature of the conduct alleged
by the first complainant in
that interview, the first complainant’s
account that her sister was not present at the relevant time, and the first
complainant’s
uncertainty concerning the circumstances of the alleged
conduct. The notes also record that the first complainant’s response
‘the majority’ of the questions put to her was, ‘I don’t
[16] The first
complainant is available for cross-examination in pursuit of the defence line of
inquiry in relation to those matters,
and the ability to challenge her
credibility and reliability has not been lost or significantly prejudiced. The
defence also has
available to it a recent statement by the police officer who
conducted the interview indicating that police were unable to obtain
consistent and particularised account of the allegations made by the first
complainant despite a lengthy attempt to develop rapport,
and indicating the
police officer’s opinion at that time that there was insufficient evidence
to charge the accused. The most
that can be said is that by reason of the
unavailability of the recording or transcript of the second interview the
defence is potentially
precluded from exploring what are described as ‘the
magnitude of the inconsistencies between and across the three different
[17] As the High
Court observed in
R v Edwards
[2009] HCA 20
(2009) 255 ALR 399
, trials often
involve the reconstruction of events where documents, recordings and other
relevant material are not available and/or
material witnesses may have died.
The determination of issues of fact on less than all of the material which might
relevantly bear
upon the matter does not of itself make the trial unfair.
frequently the case that criminal trials proceed with missing evidence, either
in the form of a witness’s oral testimony
or some form of documentary
evidence. A jury direction has been formulated to deal with those
circumstances: see
Longman v The Queen
[1989] HCA 60
(1989) 168 CLR 79.
direction, juries are commonly told they must not speculate on what other
evidentiary material may have been available,
they must make their decision
based on the evidence before them, and they may take into account any forensic
disadvantage they consider
the accused has suffered by reason of missing
evidence. Where the issue of the missing evidence has arisen in circumstances
that direction may be combined with a direction in accordance with
Evidence (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011
informing the jury of the nature of any forensic disadvantage to the accused by
reason of the delay and the need to take that
disadvantage into account when
considering the evidence.
[19] We are
unable to accept the original judge’s conclusion or the respondent’s
submission that the first complainant
cannot be questioned effectively, either
the incident
recorded in the police notes. While it is no doubt the case that
the first complainant cannot be questioned in detail about inconsistent
statements asserted to have been made in the second child forensic interview, it
would be an exercise in speculation to conclude
that there is any such
inconsistency beyond what is apparent from the police notes.
[20] Although it
is no doubt correct to say that a complete reconstruction of the second
interview is not possible from the notes,
their content still provides the
defence with a substantial forensic advantage. It is also conceivable that the
recording or transcript
of the second interview might have placed a different
complexion on what appears from the face of the police officer’s notes,
which clearly operate to undermine the account given by the first complainant in
the second interview. But whatever the potential
prejudice or disadvantage to
the accused in that respect may be, that matter may be adequately addressed by a
direction, which could be combined with a delay direction if
considered necessary: see, for example,
Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic)
[2017] VSCA 120
[2021] NSWCCA 17
R v Slattery
[2002] NSWCCA 367.
[21] For these
reasons, the determination that this was an extreme case warranting the rarely
justified step of a permanent stay was
manifestly erroneous. Accordingly, we
make the following orders:
appeal is allowed.
order made on 21 June 2023 permanently staying the proceedings is set
proceedings brought by counts 1 and 2 in the indictment dated 4 November 2022
may continue.
publication of these reasons for decision is restricted to the parties and their
legal representatives until further
