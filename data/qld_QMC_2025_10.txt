SOLICITORS:
L. Marinovic for the applicant Aggrieved.
The Respondent did not appear
Sgt. P. Gangemi for the original QPS applicant
[1] JEK applies to vary order protecting her and her children from REM by ending
it immediately. These are the reasons for dismissing
application.
[2] REM has 5-page criminal history covering his whole adult
life. Offences of public nuisance, assault police and liquor offences
prevalent. 2017 saw the first of his 5 previous court appearances for domestic
violence offences.
[3] A Domestic Violence Order was made on 22 Feb 2023
against the Respondent which protected the Aggrieved. The first condition was
the mandatory condition protecting her, the second her children. The third
prevented the Respondent from contacting her (with a number
of exceptions) and
the last fourth from him going within 50m of her (also with exceptions). Neither
party attended the original hearing
of the matter, filed any material, or had a
lawyer there to represent them.
[4] In 2023 the Respondent received a
suspended sentence which he breached with offending against this Aggrieved. He
was imprisoned
to be released on 1 March 2024.
[5] On 10 July 2024 JEK file
the present application to effectively end the entire order and cease all
protection for her and her
children, one of whom is the respondent’s. Many
of the applications to vary I deal with are from Aggrieved seeking to reduce
remove orders for their own protection or that of their children.
Variation Application
[6] Any party can apply to vary any DV order including
a TPO as often as they wish.
[7] The application must:
(a) be in the approved form; and
(b) state the grounds on which it is made; and
(c) state the nature of the variation sought; and
(d) if the applicant is not a police officer—be verified by the
applicant by a statutory declaration
declaration
(e) be filed in the court.
[8] The approved form appears to permit three type of sub-applications to be
made. In Item 5, the first is to vary the conditions
of the order. It asks for
‘details of the condition/s that you would like added or varied’.
This Application simply states
‘All conditions’.
following box marked ‘Give Reasons’ the Aggrieved wrote ‘Help
with the children with everything. Etc-
indoors, outdoors &
travelling’.
[10] Item 5B allows for a request to vary the duration of
the order. This was ticked and the box ‘When would you like the order
end?’ contains the letters ‘ASAP’. The form then says
‘Give reasons’ without providing any box or
even a space to do
[11] Item 5C Allows for persons to be added or removed but does not
provide a place to indicate which. Three children are listed on
this application
only two of which are named on the DVO. There is another child listed on this
DVO but not in the application. There
is a ‘Give Reasons’ box but it
[12] Attached to the form is a handwritten document which
REM and I have a child together. The child is an infant and has a
very close bond with REM. I am currently working at [a place] and
will need help
with all children that’s listed. My mother is my only support at the
moment but she has doctors appointment
to attend to which cut myself down on
work. My mother also has health issues & heart problems is her biggest
issue. For myself
to be safe from DV I’m currently seeing a support
worker. I’ve also got cimesafe screens in place, security sensors lights
installed and security cameras. Will be need [REM’s] help ASAP with the
children including indoors, outdoors & travelling.
The respondent is
currently attending appointments – AODS
[13] I take it that there are
in effect three applications to vary. The first is to remove all conditions, the
second to vary it to
expire immediately and the last to remove the
[14] The stated grounds are that the Aggrieved wants the Respondent
to assist with the children.
[15] Her affidavit filed 8 Nov 2024 expands
somewhat on the grounds. It says ‘I am aware that the current order allows
to approach and contact me for purposes of having contact with our child
or children. I am, however, finding that I am in need of
greater help with
day-to-day parenting tasks than the order allows.’
[16] In continues
‘For example, I would like [REM] to be able to assist with shopping,
cooking, cleaning, laundry and other
household chores. Many of these will need
to be done at times when the children are not around, and so are not directly
with his contact with them. The orders, or at least makes it very
difficult, for him to do so.’
What resulted in the order?
Court can only vary an order if it considers both the grounds of the original
order and the finding of the court that made
[18] A large proportion of orders are
made without hearings and without findings because the Respondent consents
without admissions.
The only ‘finding’ is that there is a relevant
relationship and that the Aggrieved also
[19] What weight attaches to the
grounds in such a matter is therefore an open question. This section seems to
elevate them from mere
allegations to something, the truth of which is assumed
and makes them relevant to the application to vary.
[20] In this case however
there were findings.
[21] The original application sets out an incident
occurring on 19 Feb 2023 at 4:15am when JEK called police stating her partner
assaulted her in the head. On arrival, both were intoxicated. The Aggrieved
said she was struck from behind and fought back. He has
thrown items at her and
headbutted her and pulled her hair out before throwing her into a portable
speaker. At the time the Aggrieved
said the relationship was over and she feared
[22] The Respondent told police he was making food and when an argument
commenced, the Aggrieved grabbed a bread knife. He used the
items to defend
himself and then went to leave.
[23] The QP9s for that incident record that
as police placed him into the police car, he yelled at her ‘You’re a
cunt, wait til I get out of jail’.
[24] I made the order when
neither party affected by the order sought attended at Court. That means my
findings must have included
that there was an act of domestic violence and that
an order protecting the parties was necessary and desirable. That clearly was
acceptance of her version which that application makes clear was supported by
the police observations of the scene and the injuries
to the Aggrieved.
has happened since the order was made?
[25] QPS relied on the QP9s setting
out some events since the order was made which resulted in convictions of the
Respondent.
[26] At 1:30am on 1 Oct 2023 there was argument over a misplaced
scoop of baby formula. He verbally abused her with some children
present. He
then walked back to the verandah where he had obtained two hammers, holding one
in each hand. She grabbed one which he
grabbed back. While she was holding their
baby, he held a pair of scissors to her head and said ‘Put that baby down
kill you’. He then punched her in the head and mouth more than
once as she held the baby, splitting her lip and causing bruising.
get one her children to call tiple 0. There are photos of her
[27] It was this incident that saw him imprisoned for some
Would the safety, protection or wellbeing of the Aggrieved or children
be adversely affected the variation.
[28] It is this same man that the
Aggrieved says of in her affidavit “I am confident that, if the
application is granted, the
children and I will be able to remain safe”.
[29] Section 92(3) requires her to convince the Court of that

uses violence and weapons towards her and in front of the children. The lights,
cameras and screens she mentions will do nothing
to protect her or them if he
has been allowed into the house.
[31] The existing order keeps the
Respondent away from the Aggrieved unless they are at an agreed contact.
[32] A letter was provided from a service provide who ‘provides
support to the Cherbourg Community experiencing domestic and
family violence
with a primary focus on improving immediate safety’. Support was provided
from Oct 2023 to May 2024. The letter
was written in Nov 2024. Nowhere does it
indicate that the author knows that the Aggrieved wants the Respondent back in
[33] There is a five dot-point list of items covered one being
‘Keeping boundaries in place, for safety’. Whatever was
discussed, it is difficult to accept that such a topic has been fully acted on
by the Aggrieved if the order is sought to
be varied to end, to have all
conditions removed and have the children removed.
What is the
Respondent’s position?
[34] The Respondent for his part has not
appeared or filed any material. There is nothing at all to show that he has
changed at all
from the person who breached the order in its current
[35] There is nothing to show he even wants this application granted or
that he wants to do the housework the Aggrieved has in mind
for him. There is
also nothing from the Aggrieved setting out anymore other than he was at one
point going to AODS
. While he may have
continued that since it would be a significant departure from the last 15 years
of alcohol related offending.
[36] The QPS, who were the
original applicant, point out that the variation sought is unnecessary to meet
the reasons given in the
application. In this Court’s experience, it is
probably more common than not that this is the case when an Aggrieved seeks
weaken orders.
[37] At present he can do housework etc. even at the
Aggrieved’s home if she is not there or while having contact with the
children by written agreement.
[38] Despite this her material fails to
address whether they have a written agreement and if not why or why it has
proven unworkable.
[39] She can also contact him anytime without being
impeded. If she were to ring him or seek him out and meet him, he would not
his order by participating in that conversation.
The wishes of the Aggrieved
is just one of the factors that must be considered. This is especially so to
stop the exposure of the children to domestic
In considering whether to make the variation, the court must have regard
(a) any expressed wishes of the aggrieved or named person; and
(b) any current contact between the aggrieved or named person and the
respondent; and
(c) whether any pressure has been applied, or threat has been made, to the
aggrieved or named person by the respondent or someone
else for the respondent;
(d) the principle that the safety, protection and wellbeing of people who
fear or experience domestic violence, including children,
are paramount; and
(e) any other relevant matter.
[41] There is simply no evidence about any current contact between the parties.
There is also no way of assessing whether any pressure
has been applied. At its
highest, these are the Aggrieved’s own genuine
Consideration
[42] Without being necessary to decide, it is
difficult to see how an application to reduce an order can ever succeed until at
very least, the Respondent has demonstrated some sustained change in
behaviour resulting from the successful completion of an appropriate
change course and the passing of sufficient time to show it has made a
difference to the risk.
[43] Even that would not be sufficient in many cases
to meet the strictures of s.92(3):
(3) The court may vary the order only if
the court considers—
(a) the safety, protection or wellbeing of the
aggrieved or the named person would not be adversely affected by the variation;
(b) if the variation is to reduce the duration of the order—there
are reasons for doing so.
[44] The section specifies all of things that the
Aggrieved wants varied as being ‘Examples of variations that may adversely
affect the safety, protection or wellbeing of a person’.
