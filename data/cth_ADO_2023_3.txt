of the design,
Wynnes Patent and Trade Marks Attorneys Pty Ltd requested to be heard regarding

PPP the Requestor sought
examination of the Design. The request was filed with prior art documents which,
in the Requestor’s
view, rendered the Registered Design not new and
distinctive when compared to the prior art base. The parties paid the relevant
and the Design was subsequently examined. The examiner raised no grounds
for revocation and the examiner expressed an intention to
issue a certificate of
examination. On 16 March 2021, the Requestor asked to be heard.
his office issued directions for filing evidence and submissions to the
parties. The Requestor’s Evidence in Support (‘EIS’)

am to decide this matter as a delegate of the Registrar of Designs having
heard the parties by videoconference on 1 May 2023. Ben
Fitzpatrick of Counsel,
instructed by Michael Finney and Wynnes Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys Pty Ltd
appeared on behalf of the
Requestor. Peter Creighton-Selvay of Counsel,
instructed by Ashley Dickson of Raven IP appeared on behalf of the Owner.
ection 68(1)(a) provides that the Registrar must be satisfied that a ground
for revocation of the registration of the design has been
made out before
revoking a registered design. The Requestor here relies solely on the ground
that the Design was not new and distinctive
as at the Priority Date. Where a
person has made an examination request under s 63 referring to material in
relation to ‘newness
and distinctiveness of the design’, the
Requestor will bear the burden of satisfying the Registrar that a ground exists
revocation.
SSS It is the Requestor who
must establish on the balance of probabilities that the Design is not a
registrable design. I do note
that to the extent that a party relies on an
allegation of confidential fetter, it will be for that party to demonstrate
such. Thus,
the onus will shift to the Owner to the extent that it alleges any
material is subject to a confidential fetter and thus should not
be considered
he evidence in these proceedings is lengthy and at parts not relevant. Below
I have summarised the evidence, with some details where

arious statutory declarations are provided as the EIS. There are formal
requirements for statutory declarations which are not met
in these documents,
but they nevertheless substantially comply with the requirements for a
declaration made under the Act.
illigan-1 and its Annexures are in summary a mixture of catalogues from 2013,
together with invoices and photographic examples stated
to have been purchased
from the Owner in 2017. Annexure A is a copy of a document from a 2011
convention for the Requestor’s
authorised installers or licensees;
Annexure B is a copy of a 2012 technical bulletin; Annexures C to F are copies
of quotations,
sales invoices and MYOB payments from before the Priority Date
and mentioning product codes ‘18A-DRIV-M25’ and
‘17A-DRIV-M5-100’;
Annexure G is a copy of the Requestor’s
price list from September 2013, which includes products under the product codes
‘18A-DRIV-M25’
and ‘18A-DRIV-M25-100’, which I reproduce
below in Schedule 1 to these reasons; and Annexure H consists of various
photographs
of what are termed the ‘M25 Driver Tool’ which the
Requestor had allegedly purchased from the Owner in 2017.
ulte-1 in summary contains assertions about alleged similarity of the Design
to prior art, some history about the development of various
security fastener
and driver tool products as well as some background to Mr Bulte’s business
of supplying the Requestor with
tamper proof fasteners.
amachandran-1 provides some background to the development of the Design, the
nature of the Requestor’s business and past dealings
between the Owner and
the Requestor. It describes Mr Ramachandran’s experience of many years and
includes a self-characterisation
that he is an informed user of tamper proof
security screws and associated driver tools. Opinions are expressed comparing
with various prior art. The Annexures in summary consist of: Annexure
A being catalogues of products provided by the Requestor dated
September 2013;
Annexure B being a 2012 technical bulletin showing the type of fastener for
which the drivers made to the Design
are said to be aimed at fastening;
Annexures C and D showing two bit drivers; Annexure E being corporate
documentation; Annexure
F showing Australian patent application 2014200312 B2

dated); and Annexure N being United States patent US9,132,534
‘screwdriver bit’.
illigan-2 makes a number of corrections to certain language of Milligan-1 and
attaches a copy of Milligan-1. It confirms that the
Requestor does not sell
products directly to the public and does so by authorised installers and
licensees, being distributors.
aylor-1 in summary consists of a history of Mr Taylor’s experience and
his companies. Mr Taylor’s opinion about comparisons
with prior art in the
EIS are also expressed. Taylor-1 asserts that ‘[t]here has been no self
disclosure of the design of design
number 201712220’.
TTT I summarise the Exhibits from here: Exhibits 1,
2 and 19 being documents relating to the ownership and control of the companies
of Mr Taylor; Exhibit 3 being a license agreement from 2010; Exhibit 4 being an
inventory list from 2010; Exhibit 5 is a series of
tables listing product sales
in 2009; Exhibits 6 and 7 being inventory reports from 2009 to 2010; Exhibit 8
being hand written notes
in a table with entries from 2007 to 2009; Exhibit 9
being a data table; Exhibit 10 being technical drawings which are undated;
11 being a table with various entries alongside images of different
drivers, titled ‘MK25 Driver Bit Register’; Exhibit
12 being an
unsigned supply agreement; Exhibit 13 which appears to be a meeting invitation
dated 9 March 2017 with an email sent
earlier that day from Mr Taylor to Mr
Ramachandran, which summarises a discussion with Ramachandran and then makes
some notes stating
amongst other things that the, ‘“New” Torso

24 April 2017 enclosing test reports with drawings dated March 2017, referencing
‘the New Driver M25-100-Torso’,
stated as having been issued to Mr
Ramachandran on 10 March 2017. The email shows images of products labelled
‘MK25-Driv-100
(old Style)’ and ‘MK25-Torso-100’ and a
side view of a tool which matches the Right Hand View and Left Hand View
Design; Exhibits 15 and 16 being two screen capture images from videos; Exhibit
17 and 18 being copies of purchase orders
from the Requestor to a supplier dated

products with central focus being on an email from 8 November
2016 which I later
discuss. Annexures A to C consist of, in summary, background material relating
to the development of the Design
which is not in dispute; Annexure D is an email
dated 30 April 2015 concerning past testing of other drivers in which Mr Taylor

further study; Annexure E is an email from 15 January 2016 from
Mr Taylor to
Steve Daly, Technical and Quality Assurance Manager of the Requestor, which
purports to indicate that the driver referenced
as the ‘Torso’;
Annexure F is an email dated 8 November 2016, (which I extract below at
paragraph 38 of these reasons)
showing an image of a driver which the parties
referred to throughout the hearing as the ‘Torso Driver’; Annexure G
a copy of an email from an authorised licensee, dated 18 September 2015,
which purports to show distribution of variously labelled
drivers, ‘out to
customers’ so they can be returned after 6 weeks, for testing purposes
(the email does not present with
any attachment); Annexure H is an email dated
28 May 2014 from Wayne Proud, Business Development Manager of the Requestor,
that at times the Requestor’s authorised licensees provide
their drivers to the public; Annexure I is an email chain from 24
January 2017
titled with the subject ‘screw independent third party testing’
between Mr Taylor and Mr Ramachandran in
which Mr Taylor wrote ‘Any
MK5-Driv-Torso- 50mm STUBBY design”; Annexure J is an
email from 9 March 2017 from Mr Taylor to Mr Ramachandran and Mr Daly,
seeking feedback; Annexure K is an email dated 24 April 2017 from Mr Taylor to
Mr Ramachandran where he wrote, ‘please
find attached details as requested
on the New Driver MK25-100-Torso’;
Annexure L consists of various emails which are not of relevance; Annexures M to
T are purchase order documentation for items
‘18A-DRIV-M25-100’ and matching packing slips; Annexure U is a copy
of a sales report from the Requestor for
sales of products dated ‘23
November 2016 to 16 April 2017’; Annexures V to AB relevantly includes
various customer orders
taken by the Requestor from authorised installers as
well as packing slips, all dated before the Priority Date; Annexure AC is a
spreadsheet from Mr Daly which shows that, between 2010 to June 2012, products
with the name ‘MK25 BH Series drivers’
were supplied to the
Requestor; Annexure AD is a copy of an email and diagrams of several fasteners;
Annexures AE to AG are blank;
and Annexure AH appears to be an e-signature
document for the declaration.

18 September 2015, which
is also at Annexure G to Ramachandran-2, sent to Mr Daly with the correct
attachments showing the design
referred to therein is unlike the Torso Driver,
apparently showing that this email did not relate to the products asserted by
Mr Ramachandran in his evidence.

ne such ground is that a design is not a registrable design. A design is a
‘registrable design’ if the design is ‘new

existed before the priority date of the design.
The words ‘prior art
base’ carry the meaning provided in s 15,
OOO which relevantly provides that the prior art
base consists of designs publicly used in Australia and designs published in a
within or outside Australia.

prior art base for the design.
design is distinctive unless it is substantially similar in overall
impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base
for the design (see
section 19).
ubject to paragraph 15(2)(c), the newness or distinctiveness of a design is
not affected by the mere publication or public use of
the design in Australia on
or after the priority date of the design, or by the registration of another
design with the same or a
later priority date.

found in s 19, which I set out below:

Interpretation of the Design
efore embarking on any comparison for the purposes of assessing newness and
distinctiveness it is first necessary to consider the
Design. The Requestor
asserts that in making comparisons I should disregard all matter indicated in
the broken lines and compare
only the end portion of the product depicted in the
representations in solid linework. If I am to do this then the Design might be
considered identical, if not substantially similar in overall impression, to
various distal end portions for driving products generally,
irrespective of the
total shape and configuration of, for example, the handles, stems and end
portions as respective wholes. The
Requestor supports this argument in part
based on its interpretation of words of the product name, ‘driver bit for
which it views as indicating the end distal portion of the
overall thing pictured in the representations. The Owner counters that
reading of the product name is not justified and that the design should be read
as being the overall thing shown. If I interpret
the Design as being for a
portion and not the overall thing pictured, then the comparative exercise
conducted may turn out to be
quite different. That is, I would compare only the
portion shown in the dotted lines to a corresponding element of any relevant
his argument appears to be a ‘partial design’ argument. These
arguments before delegates of the Registrar have generally
not succeeded.
TTT It does not appear possible under the Act to
‘claim’ less than the whole of a thing, unless that is a separable
permitting assembly and disassembly.

this respect to many overseas.
than a system of ‘claims’ which includes partial claiming of the
visual features, it is possible for an applicant
for a design application to
provide a SoND which requires particular regard be paid to specific visual
features when comparing designs.
Whilst a physically separated part may be the subject of a design, the claiming
of a portion of a larger whole is not possible.
I read the representations as a
whole and not in such a way as to completely disregard the matter shown in
broken lines. I note that
there nothing in the application or registration
showing the element shown in solid lines is a separable element of the product
normally this would be depicted separately if such. There is nothing in the
SoND or otherwise that determines the dotted lines or
the solid lines are the
subject of the SoND. I read the product name for the whole product which accords
with how Mr Ramachandran’s
own evidence has treated these kinds of
ccordingly, I will compare the Design’s appearance, as a whole product
and as shown in the representations, yet I will have
particular regard to the
features mentioned in the SoND. There is a difficulty here because the language
of the SoND does not seem
to fit neatly with what is depicted. In having this
particular regard, the Requestor asserts that only the parts depicted in the
representations in solid lines should be considered. The SoND refers to the
‘shape and configuration’ of the thing as
depicted in the
representations and yet there is broken and solid lines. There is no clear
connection with either broken lines or
the solid lines and the SoND. I consider
the SoND as having the effect such that I should have particular regard to the
configuration overall, regardless of broken or solid lines.

n comparing the Design with the prior art, I must examine the designs side by
side and with a studied comparison. I must consider
the factors in s 19 and
reach a conclusion as to whether the Design is substantially similar in overall
impression to the design.
I should consider the factors from the perspective of
the informed user, which is one of familiarity with the product.
III Here, the informed user is a person who is
familiar with driver bit for fasteners. The state of development of the prior
is one important consideration when assessing distinctiveness. In
short, a well developed prior art base suggest that smaller differences
of consequence and a less developed prior art base may mean that more
significant visual differences are required to avoid
substantial similarity in
overall impression. I consider the freedom of the creator of the design to be
constrained only in that
the product must fulfill the particular purpose of
engaging with a screw or fastener head at its tip, of which there are a variety
of types, and with a driver at its base. In this case there is a SoND, in
respect of which I refer to my comments at paragraphs 26
to 28 of these reasons.
Where only a part of the Design is similar, to an earlier design, I must
consider the amount quality and
importance of that similar part in the context
of the design as a whole.
threshold issue for every one of the potential citations concerning the
Torso Driver is whether the objects pictured in the image
even show something
which can be considered comparable to the Design; this is sometimes termed the
‘quantum of disclosure’.
The 8 November 2016 email shows almost all the visual features of the design.
However, what is missing is a profile view of the

end portion. The image is also not the best quality from which to glean
details of the blades of the side portions.
he Requestor asserts that Taylor-1 acknowledges that the design labelled the
Torso Driver, is the Design. It submits that Mr Taylor
accepts this, referring
to Taylor-1 at [34] and [35] and the email dated 8 November 2016. However, I do
not consider the statements
as unequivocal about this issue. The Requestor also
referred me to the email dated 24 April 2017 in which Mr Taylor states,
find attached details as requested on the New Driver
MK25-100-Torso’.
TTT The attachment
to the email contains the following image:
he Requestor asserts that ‘MK25-Torso-100’
Driver. At the hearing and in its written submissions the Owner raised the
quantum of disclosure as an answer to all of
the citations concerning the Torso
Driver. That is, there is not a sufficient amount of disclosure in this prior
art to enable me
to make a fair comparison between the designs and, in any case,
what is disclosed is not substantially similar in overall impression.
particular, the Owner points to no depiction of: (i) the geometry of the distal
end portion; (ii) whether the distal end portion
is flat (or not); and (iii)
whether the distal end portion has a centrally located socket (or not). These
points raised by the Owner
have force with respect to the issue of newness. I
cannot conclude that the design is not new on the basis of this material.
s to making the comparison about distinctiveness, I cannot draw inferences
around the symmetry of the features mentioned. I can reasonably
inference that the driver likely continues in the form circumferentially in
appearance. However, it is not clear from the
images provided what exact shape
and configuration the tip and its sides take, including the grooving or
socketing. As this material
has been raised in the EIR as a core citation relied
upon by the Requestor, the Owner has also had no formal opportunity to provide
any countervailing representations showing what the products in the image of the
8 November 2016 actually look like at those portions.
I also note that the
Requestor itself has not provided such. Applying the principles of s 19 and
making the comparison to the extent
possible, I note the identicality or near
identity in appearance from the
Ramachandran-2, [31] and Annexure
respective side views. My findings above on the missing portion of the
product are applicable again here. This particular area of
the Design appears to
be of great importance to persons familiar with driver bits for fasteners. The
Requestor’s own submissions
concerning the 312 Patent and M25 Driver
suggest as much. This element is important because the very function of the
product is to
interact and mate with a fastener. I consider an informed user
would be one who would be conscious of at least how the driver would
mate with a
fastener or other such pin; they would likely closely examine the end portion at
the profile. This is not a case where
the informed user would not be likely to
pay close attention to the area in question or where I could necessarily infer a
into the prior art that is present in the Design. The prior art base is
highly developed, so small differences in visual features
are likely to be
significant. Even after giving weight to the similarities that do exist, my
opinion is that I cannot conclude that
the Design is substantially similar in
overall impression to the prior art in the 8 November 2016 email. For the same
reasons, the
same applies to the prior art in the 24 April 2017 email. Even if
these instances of prior art were sufficient to make a finding
of substantial
similarity, they are tainted by other issues concerning confidentiality and gaps
in the evidence which I explore further
Alleged sales of the Torso Driver
he Requestor asserts that there has been sale of the products made to the
Design. In making this argument it relies on orders and
packing slips: (1) dated
23 November 2016 for 100 ‘18A-DRIV-M25- 100’ and slip dated 24
November 2016; (2) dated 30 November
2016 for 100 of the same, and
picking slip dated 5 December 2016; (3) dated 31 January 2016 for 100 of the
same and picking slip
dated 1 February 2017; (4) dated 1 March 2017 for 200 of the same, with
picking slip dated 1 March
2017; (5) dated 8 March 2017 for 100 of the same with slip dated 9 March
2017; dated 27 March
2017 for 100 of the same, and slip dated 28 March 2017; and dated 26 April
2017 for 100 of the same with slip dated 27 April 2017.
These total 800 pieces.
Various orders from the Requestor’s own customers for products bearing the
same code are provided,
dated between December 2016 and April 2017.
