The Commission determined to affirm the decision of the
Delegate and refused to grant the application for a restaurant and café
1. On 29 April 2021, a delegate of the Victorian Commission for Gambling and
Liquor Regulation (
the Commission
) refused to grant an application for a
restaurant and café licence, on the basis that the Applicant (a body
corporate) was
not a suitable person to hold a liquor licence given its
association with a person who was an undischarged bankrupt and had demonstrated
a disregard for compliance with regulatory requirements (
the Original Decision
2. On 25 May 2021, the Applicant lodged an application for an internal review
of the Original Decision (
Review Application
section 153
Liquor Control Reform Act 1998
3. In accordance with section 154 of the LCR Act, the Commission notified
Victoria Police and the local Council of the Review Application.
Victoria Police
and the Council did not provide any further information to the Commission.
4. On 30 September 2021, the Commission handed down its decision in the
Review Application.
5. In relation to whether the Applicant is a suitable person to hold a
restaurant and café licence, the Commission considered
three main issues
(amongst other factors):
suitability of Person A;
Applicant’s association with Person A; and
probity and credibility of the evidence given on behalf of the
6. With regard to the suitability of Person A, the Commission found the
Applicant had not provided any new evidence under the Review
Application to
assure the Commission that appropriate steps would be taken to ensure Person A
would not be managing the Applicant
or the proposed liquor business while Person
A remained an undischarged bankrupt. The Commission also noted Person A was not
at the hearing and therefore the Commission did not have the opportunity
to question Person A about any outstanding issues regarding
ability to comply with regulatory regimes. On this basis the Commission found
that the Applicant did not sufficiently
address the issue regarding the
suitability of Person A.
7. Regarding whether Person A was an associate of the Applicant, the
Commission was informed a few days prior to the hearing that
Person A would no
longer be associated with the Applicant due to Person A’s spouse suddenly
resigning from their position as
a director of the Applicant. At the hearing the
Commission was informed that Person A’s spouse had not only suddenly
as a director but that all shares in the company would be transferred
to the sole director, without any form of payment or division
of business assets
that were held by the Applicant. The sole director of the Applicant stated there
was no written documentation
or agreement regarding the change in directorship
and ownership for the company as all transactions were undertaken on a basis of
trust and friendship, between the three individuals associated with the
8. The Commission raised that the application for a liquor licence had stated
that Person A would be in day-to-day management of the
proposed licenced
premises and that Person A would continue working at the proposed licenced
premises. While the sole director of
the Applicant advised that Person A had not
been managing the business for some time, he was unable to provide a clear or
response as to when Person A had ceased managing the business. The
sole director of the Applicant did not appear to have a good understanding
business operations. The Commission found the Applicant had not provided
sufficient credible evidence about how Person A’s
current role in the
business would be structured to ensure they did not have any role in directing,
managing or making executive
decisions with respect to the Applicant and the
9. Regarding the overall evidence that was given on behalf of the Applicant,
the Commission found it to be inconsistent, and lacking
probity and credibility.
Based on all the material before it, the Commission was not satisfied that the
Applicant was presently a
suitable person to hold, or carry on business under, a
liquor licence.
10. Consequently, the Commission determined to affirm the decision of the
Delegate and refused to grant the application for a restaurant
11. The Commission decided not to publish its reasons for decision in this
instance due to privacy considerations relating to the
Applicant and the
associated persons, but publishes this case note in the interests of
transparency.
