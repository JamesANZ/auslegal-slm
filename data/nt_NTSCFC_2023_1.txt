OF AUSTRALIA
Parklands Darwin Pty Ltd v Minister for Infrastructure,
Planning and Logistics (Costs)
[2023] NTSCFC 1
2020-03216-SC
PARKLANDS DARWIN PTY LTD
(ACN 166 220 248)
MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, PLANNING AND LOGISTICS
CORAM: GRANT CJ, KELLY J AND HILEY AJ
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 21 April 2023)
[1] On a reference pursuant to
Supreme Court Act 1979
(NT) the Full Court determined that legislation purporting to validate a
decision by the defendant to refuse a request by the plaintiff
to amend the NT
Planning Scheme did not infringe the principles identified in
Director of Public Prosecutions
[1996] HCA 24
(1996) 189 CLR 51.
A subsequent
application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused:
Parklands Darwin Pty Ltd v Minister for Infrastructure, Planning and
[2022] HCATrans 55.
[2] The defendant seeks orders that:
(a) the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of the reference to the Full
Court as taxed or agreed;
(b) the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of the application for costs
as taxed or agreed; and
(c) the defendant’s costs of the reference to the Full Court are certified
fit for two counsel.
[3] The plaintiff does not oppose orders in terms of paragraphs (a) and (b)
above, but does oppose an order in terms of paragraph
Rule 63.72(9)(b)
Supreme Court Rules 1987
(NT) provides that ‘[n]o fee shall be
allowed ... for more than one counsel, unless the Court certifies that the
retainer of
more than one counsel was warranted’.
[4] The basis of the plaintiff’s objection is, in essence, that minimal
evidence and materials were required on the reference;
no witnesses were called;
there were no disputed facts; there were few relevant authorities; and the
hearing before the Full Court
lasted for approximately half a day.
[5] The defendant’s position is, in essence, that both parties retained
two counsel for the reference proceedings and the application
for special leave;
the reference was legally complex; the matter gave rise to important
constitutional issues concerning the legislative
authority of the Northern
Territory; and there was limited time to prepare for hearing.
Kroehn v Kroehn
[1912] HCA 45
(1912) 15 CLR 137
at 141, Griffith CJ stated
that in determining whether the retainer of more than one counsel is warranted
regard must be had to,
amongst other factors, the importance of the case, the
probable duration of the trial, the probability of a conflict of evidence
the general practice as to employing two counsel. That formulation was applied
by Barwick CJ in
Stanley v Phillips
[1966] HCA 24
(1966) 115 CLR 470
at 478-479 as
directed to the basic issue of whether the services of more than one counsel are
reasonably necessary for the adequate
presentation of the case.
[7] Both authorities were cited by Mildren J in
Central Australian
Aboriginal Congress v CGU Insurance
[2009] NTCCA 2
, in determining
that the factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion will include the
weight of the case, the need for special
skill and the complexity of the issues
involved. That the case has significant financial consequences may also be a
relevant factor:
Liddle v North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service
[1994] NTSC 6
Joondanna Investments Pty Ltd v Minister for Lands, Planning
and the Environment (No 2)
[2015] NTSC 54
. However, the case
need not be one involving a large amount of money, or in fact any money at all,
in order to warrant the certification
of two counsel. Many cases involving
significant administrative law or constitutional issues will not have any direct
or immediate
financial consequences.
[8] In our opinion, the matter was clearly one in which it was appropriate to
brief two counsel. As the defendant has submitted,
the reference potentially
involved a number of complex constitutional issues, one of which had yet to be
determined in its application
to the Northern Territory as a body politic. That
the hearing of the matter did not exceed a day was not reflective of that
complexity,
or the level of research and analysis necessary in order to prepare
the case for presentation. These are not matters which require
evidence in
order for the Court to make an assessment. They are readily apparent from the
nature of the questions involved, the
authorities which deal with those
questions, the general experience of the courts, and the general practice as to
employing counsel
in matters of this type.
[9] Accordingly, we make the following orders:
plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs of the reference to the Full
Court, as agreed or taxed in default of agreement.
plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs of this application for costs,
as agreed or taxed in default of agreement.
defendant’s costs of the reference to the Full Court are certified fit for
two counsel.
