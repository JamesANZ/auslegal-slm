parties through their solicitors have advised me that they have reached a
settlement of Mr Anwar’s claims for compensation
for noneconomic loss
pursuant to Part 4, Division 5 of the W
orkers Rehabilitation Act 1986
the sum of $83,685 based on a 31% whole person impairment assessed by reference
to the prescribed sum applicable to an injury sustained
Anwar is a person who has a disability that is such that in connection with this
litigation he requires a litigation guardian.
Accordingly, pursuant to rule
28(5) of the Workers Compensation Tribunal Rules 2009, any settlement of his
dispute must be approved
by a Presidential Member, both as to the
appropriateness of the settlement and as to the disposition of the settlement
commence with the appropriateness of the settlement.

comprehensive and helpful opinion from Mr J Warren, of counsel.
going into the evidence in any detail there are a number of significant issues

to compensation for non-economic
loss might be determined. There is uncertainty as to whether and if so how his
entitlements would
be assessed and whether the assessments would be combined. He
ran a real risk that his overall entitlement might be assessed at a
figure well
below that which has been agreed. That is not to say that the agreed settlement
is too generous. It is not inconceivable
that if this case went to trial that Mr
Anwar might receive more. The agreed settlement reflects a compromise that
viewed objectively
is very fair.
am satisfied that it is in the best interests of Mr Anwar to accept the agreed
settlement. I approve the compromise.
now turn to the issue of the disposition of the settlement monies.
default position is the Public Trustee. Nothing that has been put to me suggests
that someone other than the Public Trustee should
as act as trustee for Mr Anwar
in connection with the settlement funds payable to him as a consequence of the
settlement of his claim.
I therefore appoint the Public Trustee as trustee. It
is authorized to invest the settlement sum and to apply it and any money derived
from its investment for the maintenance and benefit of Mr Anwar until further
