Reasons for Decision
Introduction
[1] Ms Elaine
Dean ('the Appellant') works as a fixed term temporary Quality & Safety
Officer, AO5, with the Cairns Hinterland
Hospital and Health Service ('CHHHS').
On 2 October 2025, Ms Dean was informed that the employer had reviewed
her employment status
and that her employment would remain as non-permanent,
fixed term until 26 October 2025 when her temporary fixed term contract ends.
[2] Ms Dean
appeals the decision of her employer, the State of Queensland (Queensland
Health) ('the Respondent') not to convert her
to permanency.
[3] Ms Dean
commenced with CHHHS on 18 September 2023 as a fixed term temporary employee
(AO4) and over the past two-years has carried
out various fixed term temporary
engagements.
[4] When Ms Dean
commenced in her current Mental Health Quality and Safety Officer role on 2
January 2025, it was an AO4 position.
She is backfilling an employee who is on
secondment.
February 2025, the position was reviewed and was reclassified to an
Following reclassification,
the position was advertised in August as a fixed term contract for six-months
with the possibility of
extension. Ms Dean applied for this advertised vacancy
and was not the preferred candidate following a merit-based
[6] Ms Dean has
identified a role substantially the same as the one she is currently employed in
on a temporary basis. Ms Dean requests
a substituted decision that she be
converted to permanent by way of appointment to that role.
[7] For the
following reasons, I have determined to set the decision aside and substitute it
with another decision, that Ms Dean's
employment is converted to
The decision letter
letter dated 2 October 2025, the decision-maker wrote to Ms Dean advising her,
relevantly, that:
Considerations when making the decision
I have considered the requirements of the
Public Sector Act 2022
Act), the Review of non-permanent employment (Directive 02/23) and your
employment history, including any previous conversion
review decisions.
There are two considerations for deciding whether to convert from
non-permanent fixed term temporary employment to permanent employment:
continuing need for you to perform your role or a role that is substantially the
you satisfy
being suitable to perform the role.
I have addressed these two aspects below.
I have determined that there is no continuing need for someone to be employed
in the role you are currently employed in, or a role
that is substantially the
As such I have decided that I am unable to offer to convert your employment
to a permanent basis. Specifically, my reason is there
is no continuing need for
you to perform your current role because substantive incumbent is returning to
the role on a full-time
basis following higher duties on 30 June 2026.
I note that this position was recently advertised for the fixed term temporary
for six months which you were unsuccessful in.
A review of Smart Jobs has been conducted and as of 29 September 2025, there
are no permanent AO5 positions available within CHHHS
for you to be converted
Thank you for your performance in a non-permanent fixed-term capacity over
the period since 18 September 2023. You have demonstrated
over this time
that you satisfy the requirements for the role.
As a result of this decision not to convert you to permanent, you will
continue in the role Mental Health Quality and Safety Officer,
MHAODS Clinical
Governance until 26 October 2025 when your current temporary contract
Ms Dean's reasons for appeal and Respondent's position
[9] Ms Dean says
that she has been informed by the Acting Clinical Director that the employee who
previously held the Mental Health
Act Delegate position has resigned from the
CHHHS and that the position is now vacant. Ms Dean expresses her interest in
being considered
for that role on a permanent basis and says that she has the
requisite skills, experience and understanding to successfully fulfil
responsibilities of that role.
[10] Ms Dean
asks for her application for conversion to a permanent position to be
reconsidered in light of the vacancy and her demonstrated
performance and
suitability.
Respondent says that following receipt of Ms Dean's appeal, indicating that the
role of Mental Health Act Delegate (AO5)
was substantively vacant, it undertook
inquiries regarding that role. The Respondent says that the Mental Health Unit
has advised:
the role of Mental Health Act Delegate (AO5) is not vacant,
the incumbent is on approved leave; and no resignation has been received.
unit advised that the role is currently backfilled to 30 November
Respondent seeks that the appeal be dismissed and the decision to not convert
Ms Dean's employment to permanent be confirmed.
Consideration
[13] As required
Public Sector Act 2022
(Qld) ('the
'), the CHHHS was
required to review Ms Dean's non-permanent employment status after two-years of
continuous employment. This occurred,
and a decision was made to continue Ms
Dean's employment according to the terms of her existing
employment.
[14] As required
, the CHHHS had regard to previous conversion review
[15] A decision
can be made to convert Ms Dean's employment to a permanent basis only if: there
is a continuing need for someone to
be employed in the employee's role, or a
role that is substantially the same and the employee's role; and the employee is
to perform the role.
these matters are satisfied, Ms Dean must be converted to permanent unless it is
not viable or appropriate to do so, having regard
to the genuine operational
requirements of the CHHHS.
[16] The parties
agree that Ms Dean is suitable to perform the role and on this basis, whether
the decision is fair and reasonable
depends on whether there is a continuing
need for someone to be employed in Ms Dean's role or a role that is
substantially the same.
Is there a continuing need for someone to be employed in Ms Dean's role
or a role that is substantially the same as Ms Dean's role?
Respondent submits that there is not a continuing need for Ms Dean to be
employed in the role or a role that is substantially
the same. This is because
the role Ms Dean is currently temporarily employed in is substantively filled by
another employee who is
currently on secondment.
[18] Ms Dean had
identified that the role of Mental Health Act Delegate, AO5 is substantially the
same as the role she is performing.
Ms Dean had also identified that role as
substantively vacant. However, as discussed at
above, that role is permanently
filled by another employee who is currently on leave.
[19] Ms Dean has
submitted email correspondence between the Team Leader and the employee who
substantively owns the Mental Health
Act Delegate role from 18 August 2025
where the Team Leader seeks an update regarding the employee's leave. The
employee replies
stating that they intend to exhaust their leave before
resigning the position and that they need to determine what date that will
guessing that it will be the end of October
[20] Ms Dean
submits further email correspondence between the Team Leader and the employee
dated 4 September 2025 where the employee
asks how much notice is required to
give notice of
resignation.
[21] Ms Dean
says that she manages the generic email account for the Mental Health, Alcohol
and Other Drugs ('MHAODS') Clinical Governance
Unit and has access to
correspondence within the account. Ms Dean submits that the content of the
emails referred to above indicates
that the Mental Health Act Delegate will
resign from the CHHHS when all leave is exhausted.
[22] Ms Dean
says that the Mental Health Act Delegate position has been filled by an employee
on a temporary basis for six-months.
Ms Dean acknowledges the Mental Health Act
Delegate has not completed the administrative actions to resign from the CHHHS,
that once this has occurred the role will be advertised as a permanent
vacancy, and the current temporary contract cannot be extended
six-months.
October 2025, the Respondent provided brief closing submissions confirming that
as of 21 October 2025, a resignation had
not been received by the substantive
Mental Health Act Delegate position holder and as such, the position is not
[24] It is not
in dispute that the role Ms Dean currently fills is not substantively vacant and
that there is not a continuing need
for her to perform the role. The submission
Ms Dean makes is that the Mental Health Delegate role is going to become vacant
it is substantially similar. As it will be vacant, there will be a
continuing need for someone to undertake that role.
Respondent does not argue that the Mental Health Delegate role is not
substantially the same as the role Ms Dean has been
undertaking.
[26] There have
been occasions where the Commission has found that the imminent or possible
return of the substantive role holder,
or some ambiguity about their intentions
with regard to the role is a compelling reason to find that there is not a
continuing need
for the temporary employee to fill a role.
[27] However,
this current situation differs from one where the substantive role holder has
been undertaking long-term or multiple
secondments in other roles or is on some
leave with a known return date. The email correspondence Ms Dean has annexed to
her submissions
makes it clear that the substantive role holder intends to
resign when their leave is exhausted.
correspondence Ms Dean has annexed leaves no room for ambiguity.
The substantive role holder specifically stated that they
intend to exhaust
their leave entitlements and then resign. More specifically, they have submitted
leave applications for that leave,
with an apparent end date of the leave being
24 October 2025 (the date of release of these reasons).
Respondent is aware that this correspondence has been put before me and has not
sought to make reply submissions other than
to confirm that as of 21 October
2025, the substantive employee has not submitted a resignation.
[30] Without
further submissions or the provision of correspondence indicating that the
employee has since stated that they will be
returning to the role now that they
have exhausted all leave entitlements and that they no longer intend to resign,
I have no reason
to believe that the situation has changed.
[31] In fact,
the CHHHS clearly does not expect the substantive employee to be returning when
she exhausts her leave. Their submissions
provide that the Mental Health Act
Delegate role is currently backfilled until 30 November 2025.
[32] I accept
that the decision-maker undertook a review of Smart Jobs on 29 September 2025
and that there were no A05 positions available
for Ms Dean to be converted into.
However, a substantively vacant position is not a requirement for
conversion.
I am also of the view
that the decision-maker could have considered AO5 positions the CHHHS have a
reasonable belief will become
vacant, requiring a permanent
appointment.
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the substantive role holder will
not return to the position and that there
is a continuing need for someone to be
employed in the role.
[34] Neither
party has made submissions addressing any requirement of an industrial
instrument which may preclude
conversion.
that basis, I find that it was not fair and reasonable for the decision-maker to
not convert Ms Dean's employment to permanent
on the basis that there is no
continuing need for someone to be employed in a role substantially the same as
the one she was undertaking.
[36] Ms Dean's
employment must be converted to permanent unless there are genuine operational
reasons preventing conversion.
Are there genuine operational requirements preventing
conversion?
the decision-maker decided that there was not a continuing need for Ms Dean to
be employed in the role or a role substantially
the same as that role, they
determined that it was not open to the delegate to decide to convert Ms Dean's
employment to permanent.
Therefore, it was not necessary to go on and consider
whether there were genuine operational requirements preventing Ms Dean's
to permanent.
[38] However,
the Respondent has made brief written submissions on this point.
The Respondent says that converting Ms Dean's employment
permanent would result in the generation of a new role which is not required,
needed and/or currently not funded or budgeted
for, compromising the effective
management of resources within the CHHHS.
[39] In response
to the Respondent's submission that converting Ms Dean to permanent will
generate a new role, Ms Dean says that there
would only be a 5 to 6 week period
when the Mental Health Act Delegate role would be over establishment. Further,
Ms Dean says that
the MHAODS service has other over establishment roles and that
employees have been in over-establishment roles for periods up to
7 months and
provides two examples of
[40] I accept
that it is not unusual for there to be circumstances where for short periods of
time, agencies operate some positions
'over establishment'. This is a risk which
is managed by agencies in a variety of situations. Without any submissions from
the Respondent
to refute Ms Dean's submissions that this is currently occurring
with regard to the particular position she has identified in her
submissions, I
accept that this is a practice which is currently being implemented for whatever
permanent position holder is not currently occupying the role, appears to have
exhausted their leave entitlements or will
imminently do so. I cannot identify a
significant financial detriment to the CHHHS if Ms Dean is appointed permanently
in circumstances
where there will only be a short period of time where the
Mental Health Act Delegate role will be over-establishment.
[42] I do not
accept that carrying an over-establishment permanent AO5 employee in
circumstances where the role is currently being
temporarily backfilled and is
likely to be substantively vacant in the immediate future is a genuine
operational requirement preventing
conversion. The Respondent's submissions on
this point are brief and are not supported by any additional information or
to support the contentions it makes with regard to its genuine
operational requirements preventing conversion.
that basis, I am satisfied that there are no genuine operational requirements
precluding the permanent appointment of Ms Dean
to the Mental Health Delegate
Conclusion and order
[44] For the
reasons given above from paragraphs
of these reasons for decision,
I do not think it was fair and reasonable for the decision-maker to
determine that there was no continuing
need for Ms Dean to be employed in a role
substantially the same as the one she is currently occupying, namely the Mental
Delegate role.
[45] For the
reasons given from paragraphs
of this decision, I am satisfied
that there are no genuine operational requirements precluding Ms Dean's
employment from being converted
from temporary to permanent.
[46] On that
basis, the decision of 2 October 2025 is set aside and is substituted with a
decision that Ms Dean's employment be converted
to permanent.
[47] Accordingly,
I make the following orders:
s 562C(1)(c)
Industrial Relations Act 2016
(Qld), the decision
not to convert Ms Dean's employment to permanent is set aside, and another
decision is substituted; and
Dean's temporary employment status is converted to full-time employment as
