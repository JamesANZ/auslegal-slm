REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
(the adult) is 18 years of age and of Torres Strait Islander heritage. Since his
recent release from incarceration, TBT has
been residing with a family member.
[2] On 30 July
2025, the Tribunal received applications for the following:
(a) The appointment of a guardian and administrator for TBT;
(b) The appointment of guardian and administrator under interim order for
(c) Miscellaneous matters, seeking a confidentiality order over specific
documentation received by the Tribunal.
decision on 4 August 2025, the Tribunal appointed, under an interim order, the
Public Trustee of Queensland as administrator
for TBT for all financial matters
and the Public Guardian as guardian for TBT for the matters of accommodation,
health care, provision
of services (including in relation to the National
Disability Insurance Scheme) and legal matters not relating to the adult’s
financial or property matters. The Tribunal directed the guardian and
administrator to provide a written account of their respective
appointees to the Tribunal no later than three (3) working days prior to the
hearing. The appointments were to remain
current for three (3) months or, if
the Tribunal were to make a further order in these matters, until the date of
the further order,
whichever was to be the sooner.
[4] On the same
day, the Tribunal made a pre-hearing confidentiality order whereby, pursuant to
pursuant to
sections 109
Guardianship and Administration Act
(Qld) (‘GAA’) the following documents were to be
confidential and must not be disclosed to TBT:
(a) Medical reports in relation to TBT which are identified as documents MED001,
MED005, MED006, MED007, MED008 and MED009; and
(b) Application for miscellaneous matters – Guardianship dated 30 July
pre-hearing confidentiality order was to be vacated at the start of the oral
hearing under
section 110(2)
of the GAA and the member conducting the hearing
was to decide whether to make a further confidentiality order.
November 2025, the Tribunal heard and determined the applications for the
appointment of a guardian and administrator for
TBT and the application for a
confidentiality order.
hearing of 3 November 2025, in its determination of the application for the
appointment of a guardian for TBT, the Tribunal
appointed the Public Guardian as
guardian for TBT for the personal matters of accommodation, health care,
provision of services (including
in relation to the National Disability
Insurance Scheme) and legal matters not relating to the adult’s financial
or property
matters. In its determination of the application for the
appointment of an administrator for TBT, the Tribunal appointed the Public
Trustee of Queensland as administrator for TBT for all financial matters. The
appointments are to remain current until further order
of the Tribunal. The
appointments are reviewable and are to be reviewed in three (3) years.
hearing of 3 November 2025, the Tribunal also made a confidentiality order over
several documents on the Tribunal’s
file, whereby such documents were to
be withheld from TBT.
[9] The reasons
for the decision in relation to the confidentiality order dated 3 November 2025
The Legislation
[10] Confidentiality
orders are a type of limitation
Section 103
of the GAA provides that each active party or person the Tribunal considers has
a sufficient interest in a proceeding must be given
reasonable opportunity to
access and make submissions about a document or other information before the
Tribunal that the Tribunal
considers is credible, relevant and significant to an
issue in the proceeding.
Section 104
of the GAA provides the basis of the Tribunal’s consideration for a
limitation order.
section 109(1)
of the GAA, if the Tribunal is satisfied it is necessary to avoid
serious harm or injustice to a person, the Tribunal may, but only
to the extent
necessary, by a confidentiality order, withhold from an active party or other
person a document, or part of a document,
before the Tribunal.
Section 109(2)
the GAA states that, to the extent a document or part of a document contains
health information for a person, or to the extent
other information is health
information for a person, serious harm to the person includes significant health
detriment to the person.
of the GAA provides that a confidentiality order made before a hearing is
vacated at the start of the hearing.
Section 111
of the GAA states that each active party, and any entity that would be adversely
affected by a proposed limitation order, has standing
to be heard in relation to
the making of the order.
Should the Tribunal make a
confidentiality order?
application before the Tribunal seeks specific documents to be inaccessible to
certain parties due to the risk of serious
physical, emotional and psychological
harm, including significant health detriment, to persons should the information
be disclosed.
[17] Upon the
confidentiality order of 4 August 2025 being vacated at the commencement of the
hearing, KJ (a social worker from an
acute mental health unit in a regional
hospital), the delegate of the Office of the Public Guardian and the
representative of the
Public Trustee of Queensland were invited to make oral
submissions as to whether documents on the Tribunal’s file should be
withheld from certain persons.
submitted that a new confidentiality order should be made. He sought for the
same documents that were withheld from the adult
in the pre-hearing
confidentiality order to remain withheld from the adult in order to avoid
serious harm to the adult. The serious
harm described by KJ included
significant health detriment.
delegate of the Office of the Public Guardian and the representative of the
Public Trustee of Queensland made no submissions
in relation to the application
for a confidentiality order.
[20] Whilst
neither serious harm nor injustice are defined in the GAA, case law has found
that ‘serious harm’ means physical
or psychological injury, whether
temporary or permanent, that endangers or is likely to endanger human life, or
is likely to be significant
longstanding.
[21] In this
matter, the Tribunal adopts the same approach taken by the Tribunal in the
matter mentioned above concerning
as to the meaning of
‘serious harm’ for the purposes of
section 109
of the GAA.
[22] In addition
to being directly relevant and significant, the information contained within the
identified documents is credible,
as the information came from sources deemed to
be reliable by the Tribunal.
[23] Given the
nature of the information contained within the documents, it is reasonable to
deduce that the adult would likely suffer
physical or psychological injury,
whether temporary or permanent, that endangers or is likely to endanger human
life, or is likely
to be significant and longstanding should the information
contained within the certain documents be accessed by the adult.
Tribunal was therefore persuaded by the submissions of KJ and the information
within the relevant documents that non-disclosure
of the material to the adult
would be necessary to avoid serious harm to him.
[25] For these
reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that the non-disclosure of the identified
documents is necessary to avoid serious
harm to TBT and that the non-disclosure
is only to the extent necessary by the making of the confidentiality
[26] Accordingly,
the Tribunal orders that pursuant to
section 109
of the GAA the following
documents are confidential and must not be disclosed to TBT:
(a) Medical reports in relation to TBT which are identified as documents MED001,
MED005, MED006, MED007, MED008 and MED009; and
(b) Application for miscellaneous matters – Guardianship dated 30 July
[27] In the
Tribunal’s consideration of the application for a confidentiality order,
the Tribunal is required to interpret the
statutory provisions, to the extent
possible that is consistent with their purpose, in a way that is compatible with
human rights.
A human right may be
subject under law only to reasonable limits that can be demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society
based on human dignity, equality and
rights to privacy
and recognition
as a person before the law entitled to equal protection without
discrimination
are engaged and
limited by the making of the confidentiality order. Taking into account these
findings in relation to the criteria
set out in the GAA, the Tribunal is
satisfied the limits imposed by the order are reasonable and justified in
accordance with
Human Rights Act 2019
(Qld). The orders
made are the least restrictive based on the information before the Tribunal.
[29] As required
section 113
of the GAA, a copy of the Tribunal’s reasons for its
decision to make the limitation order must be given to all active parties
the Public Advocate.
