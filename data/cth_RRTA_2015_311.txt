STATEMENT OF DECISION AND REASONS
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
This is an application for
review of a decision made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration to
refuse to grant the applicant
a Protection visa under
The applicant is a [age] year old male from Parachinar in Kurram Agency,
Pakistan who seeks to invoke Australia's protection obligations
so that he does
not have to return to that country, where he claims to fear harm on the basis of
his Shia religion, his Turi ethnicity,
his political opinion and his membership
of the particular social groups ‘Shias from Kurram Agency’, and
failed asylum seekers from a western country’.
The issues in this review are whether the applicant has a well-founded fear
of being persecuted for one or more of the five reasons
set out in the Refugees
Convention and if not, whether there are substantial grounds for believing that,
as a necessary and foreseeable
consequence of him being removed from Australia
to his receiving country of Pakistan, there is a real risk that he will suffer
significant
harm. A summary of the relevant law is contained in Attachment A.
For the following reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the decision of
the delegate should be remitted for reconsideration.
History of proceedings
The applicant arrived in Australia [in] June 2012 by boat and without a visa.
He applied for the protection visa [in] November 2012.
A delegate of the
department refused to grant the visa to the applicant [in] December 2013.
applicant appeared before the Tribunal on 22 May 2015 to give
evidence and present arguments. The Tribunal hearing was conducted with
assistance of an interpreter in the Pashto and English languages.
The applicant was represented in relation to the review by his registered
migration agent. The representative attended the Tribunal
CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE
Country of nationality
is not in dispute that the applicant is Pakistani national and he has produced
to the department a copies of his national identity
card, birth and character
certificates as well as the front pages of his passport. At hearing the
applicant told the Tribunal that
his original passport was lost at sea when the
boat he was travelling on [sank] and the applicant spent [hours] in the water
being rescued. The Tribunal finds that the applicant is a citizen of
Pakistan has assessed his claims against that country.
The applicant’s Turi ethnicity and Shia religion
Consistently
with the applicant’s own evidence, the applicant’s passport states
he was born in Kurram Agency and his birth
certificate and character certificate
indicate that he originates from the village of [name deleted] in Upper Kurram
hearing he told the Tribunal that he came from [location], being an
area slightly below [name] village only a couple of kilometres
from the city of
Parachinar, Kurram Agency.
Independent
sources indicate that Kurram Agency is one of seven Federally Administered
Tribal Agencies in in the north-west of Pakistan
and is approximately 115
kilometres long, covering an area of approximately 3,380 square kilometres. It
is bordered on the north
and west by Afghanistan and is reported to have a
population of about 448,310 according to 1998 census
which now forms Kurram Agency was part of Afghanistan before the second Afghan
War in 1878-9 and the local population
are reported to have continuously
resisted and resented Afghan
Tribunal accepts that the applicant is a member of the Turi tribe [noting] that
his evidence at hearing is consistent with the
information contained on his
birth and character certificates. The Tribunal further accepts that the
applicant is of Shia Muslim
religion, noting that DFAT reports that the majority
of Shias in FATA and Kurram Agency are from the Turi tribe, the only exclusively
Shia Pashtun tribe
Other sources indicate that a small minority of Pakistan’s Pashtun
population are Shia and are concentrated in a small number
of tribes including
the Turi and Bangash tribes of Kurram
Tribunal accepts that the applicant’s identity documents identify him by
name, tribe and place of origin and that the combination
of these factors,
together with his usual Shia religious practises, will cause him to be
identified throughout Pakistan as a Shia
Muslim of the Turi tribe from
Parachinar. The Tribunal accepts the applicant’s evidence that his own
religious practice includes
daily prayers and attending an iman barghah on
Fridays and for other religious ceremonies. The Tribunal accepts that the
continues his religious practice in Australia, using a prayer room at
his place of employment and attending an imambarghah in
[location].
The applicant’s background
The Tribunal considers the applicant to be a credible witness. It accepts
his evidence as to his family composition and circumstances
and his own
employment and education history. In particular the Tribunal accepts that the
applicant is one of [a group of siblings]
and that his family live on [farming]
property in their village where they have in the past farmed [product] for their
own consumption
and [products] for consumption and sale. The Tribunal accepts
that the applicant’s father also ran a [business], but that
he ceased to
operate this business in 2008 after the attack on a convoy in which the
applicant was travelling. The Tribunal accepts
that the applicant was educated
to [a certain level], after which he helped his father with the family’s
[business] and farming
activities. The Tribunal accepts that the
applicant’s family’s farming activities are now limited because of
the conflict
and that they are currently supported financially by the
applicant’s employment in a [business] in Australia.
The applicant’s fear of harm in Parachinar
applicant claims to have been travelling in a convoy on the road to Peshawar
which was attacked by extremists in 2008, telling
the Tribunal that he lost
consciousness during the attack and was taken to hospital although he
didn’t suffer any serious injuries.
He gave evidence that he was
travelling to Lahore to purchase materials for his family’s [business] at
the time of the attack
and that his travelling companion [was] killed along with
5 others in the attack. The applicant claims that his personal belongings
including his national identity card and details of the supplier he was
travelling to see were left abandoned on the road during
the attack, following
which he started receiving threatening phone calls from the Taliban and his
supplier stopped taking their calls.
The applicant fears that the
family’s supplier was abducted after his details were found in the
documents lost by the applicant
in the attack and the Taliban discovered he was
supplying goods to Shias in Parachinar. While the Tribunal accepts the
applicant’s
fear in this regard to be genuinely held, it considers it to
be speculative and only one of a number of possible explanations as
supplier may have stopped taking the family’s calls.
applicant claims to have been present at a bomb blast that occurred in February
2012 near the Osmania Plaza market in Parachinar
in which 37 people were killed.
Independent sources report that the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack
on a market in February
2012 which reportedly killed 26 people and injured at
least 50 others, with Fazal Saeed, the leader of a breakaway faction of the
Pakistani Taliban reportedly stating that they had targeted the Shia community
of Parachinar because they were involved in activities
. A further bomb
blast was reported at the Turi market in Parachinar in September 2012, with the
BBC reporting that 12 people were
killed and dozens injured when a car bomb
exploded as a security convoy passed by in the Turi market, destroying 30 shops
and damaging
applicant told the Tribunal that his family was unable to continue operating the
[business] after the attack and that his father
also stopped farming the
family’s land given his age and poor eye sight. He stated that his
parents didn’t permit his
brothers to farm the land, believing it was too
dangerous for them to go outside. The applicant stated that his parents
that it was too dangerous for him to remain in Parachinar as the
Taliban had his details and that he travelled to Peshawar in about
and later to Lahore, where he departed Pakistan by air for Australia.
Tribunal considers the applicant’s account of his experiences in
Parachinar to be consistent with information before the
Tribunal from
independent sources about events in Parachinar and Kurram Agency. The violent
conflict between Shi’a Turi/ Bangash
and Sunni Bangash in Kurram Agency
has occurred sporadically since the 1970s, but more recently members of the
Afghan Taliban have
regularly sought passage through Kurram following the
arrival in Afghanistan of NATO forces in
The most recent
period of conflict began in 2007 in April 2007, when Sunni members of the
Bangash tribe attacked a Shi’a procession
in Parachinar, killing over 50
people and sparking the most recent conflict. By 2009, fighting had claimed more
than 1,500 lives,
injured thousands more, and caused massive dislocation of
residents. The International Crisis Group has argued that Sunni Bangash
tribesmen carried out this attack after they were emboldened by the presence of
the Taliban and their “hard-core brand”
effects of this conflict on the Shia residents of Parachinar during this period
has been devastating, with the Shia population
subjected to frequent suicide
bombings and targeted attacks on the Shia
reports that ongoing counterinsurgency operations by the Pakistani security
agencies against the Taliban and other militants
in FATA have also resulted in a
high level of generalised violence and widespread displacement of communities
from the FATA. DFAT
assesses that there is a high degree of generalised
violence and a moderate risk of sectarian violence in some areas of the FATA
that the security situation remains
are indications that the security situation in Kurram Agency has decreased in
recent years. The DFAT report on Shias in Pakistan
released in April 2015
reports that:
4.35 DFAT understands that a 2013 truce ('the Murree Agreement') between the
Shia Turi and mostly Sunni Bangash communities in Kurram
Agency is still in
place (as of November 2014). The main road from Thal to Parachinar, Kurram's
Agency's main town is open and is
frequently used by civilian cars. Federal
security forces maintain armed checkpoints on this road. This has resulted in an
security situation in Kurram Agency.

organisations, local representatives and residents, DFAT understands
than 3,700 families formerly displaced from Kurram Agency have been able to

some surrounding villages in Upper Kurram. However, many Shia IDPs have remained
in Kohat, Hangu,
Peshawar and nearby Islamabad where they have settled and have
existing support systems.
4.37 Overall, DFAT assesses that there is a high degree of generalised violence
in the FATA and a moderate risk of sectarian violence
in some areas. However,
the situation in the FATA remains volatile due to ongoing counterinsurgency
operations by the Pakistani security
South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP) reports that civilian and security forces
fatalities in FATA have recorded a seven years decline,
while overall fatalities
have been higher due to the increase in terrorist fatalities under the ongoing
military Operations in NWA
and Khyber Agency. It reports that total fatalities
through 2014 stood at 2,863, including 2,510 terrorists, 194 security forces
personnel and 159 civilians; as compared to 1,716, including 1,199 terrorists,
319 civilians and 198 SF personnel in 2013. While
SATP notes the number of
major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in FATA increased by
48.87 per cent in 2014 compared
to the previous year, it reports that this was
principally due to the counter-insurgency operations with the overwhelming
of fatalities occurring among groups registered as terrorists rather than
civilians or security forces personnel. SATP reports that
other parameters of
violence such as suicide attacks, explosions and sectarian attacks remained low
throughout 2014 with significantly
less casualties from both suicide attacks and
incidents of explosion. SATP records that sectarian violence in the region also

quarterly report on sectarian violence in the Federally Administered Tribal
Areas (FATA) for the period April 2014 to

Kurram Agency the report noted that the region had been stable over the
reporting period and
that compared with the previous two quarters there had been
signs of improvement:

UNHCR report from June 2014 which detailed a review of those who had returned to
a region in the Upper Kurram area stated:
2) General situation and security in areas of return
All key informants in the five villages showed satisfaction over the security
situation in the area and they shared that they feel
safe and secure currently
in area of return. They unanimously stated that there is no restriction on their
movement and they can
freely move even though they also shared that for security
purpose they are stopped at check posts by the security force staff where
are asked to show their identity documents such as CNIC. When entering to the
area of origin, there are three checkpoints that
the returnees have to cross
before entering their area of origin. These checkpoints are guarded by the
khassadar and Pakistani Army.
It was shared that the military regularly checks
identity documents of all those who pass through the checkpoints.
The majority of consulted groups stated that no major security incidents had
occurred since their return to place of origin, nor
harassment incident has been
reported by the returnees.
When asked about the presence of land mines in the villages, all five
interviewees stated that they were not aware of presence of
such devices and
area was cleared by the security force and political administration prior to
their return. Two of the interviewed
respondents indicated that were briefed

the Taliban attacked a house in Parachinar.
Those injured were identified as
being Shia.
November 2013:
Three persons were killed and several injured in separate bombing incidents in
Parachinar. Although mainstream newsagencies

Parachinar.

reported that a passenger van hit a
roadside bomb near the town of Parachinar, killing at least seven people and
wounding at least
three others. The report referred to the view of a local
official who described the bomb blast as a ‘sectarian attack’,
resident of Parachinar maintained that all the fatalities from the attack were
Sunni Muslims.
August 2014: the
pro-Shia news source
reported that Shia Muslims in Parachinar
had begun a sit-in to protest against the detention of Shia Muslims and a ban on
of a noted Shia scholar into Parachinar. According to the report,

from non-state agents may amount to persecution for a Convention reason if the
motivation of the non-State actors is Convention-related,
and the State is
unable to provide adequate protection against the harm. Where the State is
complicit in the sense that it encourages,
condones or tolerates the harm, the
attitude of the State is consistent with the possibility that there is
persecution:
MIMA v Respondents
[2004] HCA 18
CLR 1, per Gleeson
CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ, at [23]. Where the State is willing but not able to
provide protection, the fact that the authorities,
including the police, and the
courts, may not be able to provide an assurance of safety, so as to remove any
reasonable basis for
fear, does not justify an unwillingness to seek their
protection:
MIMA v Respondents
[2004] HCA 18
CLR 1, per Gleeson
CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ, at [28]. In such cases, a person will not be a victim

not provide citizens in the position of the person with the level of protection

reports that attacks by the TTP and other militants against police and security
forces in some parts of Pakistan limit governments’
ability to exercise
effective control and enforce the law, including in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP) reported in February 2014 that FATA –
often described as the most dangerous place on
earth – registered a 40%
decline in overall terrorism-related fatalities from 2,901 in 2012 to 1,716 in
2013. SATP reports
that fatalities declined principally due to
Islamabad’s growing reluctance to continue with military operations in
agencies of FATA, noting that operations in Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand,
Orakzai, and South Waziristan Agencies remained suspended through
2013 as the
government focused on talks with the TTP. SATP reports that the continuing
successes of the US drones in eliminating
the top terrorist leadership
considerably weakened terrorist formations in FATA. Although recorded
fatalities in FATA during 2013
dropped against the figures from 2012, 133 major
incidents were recorded in 2013 resulting in 1,534 deaths. SATP reports that
were 235 fatalities in FATA between 1 January 2014 and 23 February

that there has been some improvement in the security situation in FATA during

are entitled to expect as discussed in

(2007) 233 CLR 18
the High Court endorsed the proposition
that a person will not be excluded from refugee status merely because he or she
sought refuge in another part of the same country, if under all the
circumstances it would not be reasonable to expect him or her
to do so. The
Court further held at [24] that what is reasonable, in the sense of practicable,
must depend on the particular circumstances
of the applicant and the impact upon
that person of relocating within their country. As Kirby J stated at [97], the
supposed possibility
of relocation will not detract from a “well-founded
fear of persecution” where any such relocation would, in all the
circumstances, be unreasonable.
Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant, as a citizen of Pakistan, has the
right to relocate within Pakistan. The range of factors
which may be relevant
in any particular case to the question of whether relocation is reasonably
available will be largely determined
by the case sought to be made out by an
hearing the Tribunal discussed with the applicant the possibility that he could
relocate to a city such as Islamabad or Rawalpindi
in Punjab, where DFAT reports
that levels of generalised and sectarian violence are lower relative to other
parts of Pakistan
is submitted that given the applicant’s personal profile as a young male
Shia Turi and the growing power of extremist groups
throughout Pakistan, it is
not possible for the applicant to relocate safely anywhere within Pakistan. It
is further submitted that
such relocation is in any event unreasonable in the
particular circumstances of the applicant given that the applicant’s

support the applicant in a city like Islamabad or Rawalpindi

time, that the applicant has never lived in Pakistan outside of his

2015 assessment describes Punjab as an ideological sanctuary and recruitment
ground for terrorist formations in Pakistan,
reporting that fatalities from

which occurred in the
twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. In the first 26
days of 2015, Punjab is reported to have recorded 13 terrorism related
fatalities. The
Jamaat al-Ahrar
, a faction of the TTP, claimed
responsibility for a bomb blast killing eight people and wounding 25 others in
an imambarghah in Rawalpindi
on 9 January 2015. On 16 January 2015, 3 Shia men
were shot dead while returning from a religious gathering in Rawalpindi district
and the TTP claimed responsibility for the attack. Four Shias were killed and
six others injured when a suicide bomber blew himself
up at an imambargah in
Rawalpindi on 18 Febraury
Tribunal notes independent reports of sectarian clashes in November 2013 at a
Muharram procession in Rawalpindi resulting in
a number of deaths and subsequent
reports that the Taliban had stated it would target Shias in Rawalpindi in
retaliation
Media reports indicate that Pakistan’s Interior Ministry has declared
Islamabad ‘extremely dangerous’ due to
the presence of banned
organisations including

Lashkar-e-Jhangvi
Tribunal further notes that the applicant has limited education and has worked
only in unskilled positions, primarily for his
father. He has no family
connections on which he could rely in areas outside of the areas of Parachinar
in Pakistan. His family
are not in a position to financially support the
applicant to relocate within Pakistan, rather he is currently for financially
his parents and siblings. The Tribunal accepts that as a Turi Shia
from Parachinar, the applicant will be imputed with an anti-Taliban
opinion. While security may be better in cities such as Islamabad and
Rawalpindi, the Tribunal accepts that a person with
the applicant’s
profile, being a young male Turi Shia from Parachinar with an imputed
anti-Taliban political opinion and living
without family or social support, may
attract the adverse attention of religious extremists if he were to relocate
elsewhere within
Pakistan. The Tribunal considers that in the particular
circumstances of the applicant, relocation is not practically available
