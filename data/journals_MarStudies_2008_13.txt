The UNEP/GEF South China Sea Project is a large Global Environment Facility
funded project implemented by the United Nations Environment
Programme and is
working to develop regionally coordinated programs of action designed to reverse
environmental degradation, such
as the loss of coastal habitats and the
over-exploitation of fisheries.
A Google Earth layer for the South China Sea Project was recently created to
extend project information and outputs to the Google
Earth community. The wide
range of outputs and information generated through the UNEP/GEF South China Sea
Project can now be explored
on Google Earth. The South China Sea Project layer
on Google Earth features the project’s institutional network, suite of
demonstration sites, and a large number of site characterisations for
coastal habitat areas in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand.
The feature is also being used as a tool for the online sharing of
information and data among natural scientists and resource managers
in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The layer is linked up to the South China Sea Project
website that contains a
wide range of databases, information resources, and awareness materials on
environmental and natural resource
management in the South China Sea region

Russian Navy reclaims its blue-water force
In early February 2008, the Russian Navy completed the most ambitious
deployment of its ocean-going forces in post-Soviet history.
On 3 February 2008,
the carrier battle group comprising the
Admiral Kuznetsov
class guided-missile destroyers,
Admiral Chebanenko
Admiral Levchenko
, and two auxiliaries returned to the main naval base of
the Russian Northern Fleet, Severomorsk. These exercises are indicative of
resurgent Russian blue-water capability.
The return to the main naval base, the Russian Northern Fleet Severomorsk,
marked the end of a 71-day 15,000-nautical mile-long deployment
Mediterranean, north-eastern and central Atlantic. Altogether, the deployment
involved a combined strike group of 11 units,
including four major surface
combatants, drawn from the Northern, Baltic and Black Sea fleets.
Units of the strike group made 11 port calls to six nations, including Italy,
France, Portugal and Tunis, as well as performing over
100 various combat tests.
In addition, ship-borne aircraft executed over 400 sorties. These activities
formed part of three tactical
exercises carried out during the deployment.
The largest wargame, the third tactical exercise, was staged between January
19-24, 2008, in the central Atlantic and involved combined
offensive operations
of the Russian naval strike group, elements of the aviation of the Northern
The return of the
to the Mediterranean, and such a
significant display of Russian power projection and long-range offensive
capabilities, were met
with a degree of surprise in western analytical and
defence community. The last visit of the Russian carrier group to the area was
in 1995 and, since then, doubts were raised whether the
remain operational at all, let alone a return to active combat service.
While the planning of this tour of duty began early in 2007, the final
decision to send the group was made shortly before ships left
their bases. The
hypothesis, that the deployment was of special significance to Russia’s
political-military leadership, is
supported by claims that the operation was not
scheduled in the 2007 budget, and that the resources have either come from other
or the navy was given a special financial and other funding (over one
billion rubles) to implement the plan.
The success of the deployment has assisted the Russian Navy to strengthen its
significance and prestige in the eyes of national elites
and helped to create
favourable conditions for the resumption of Russia’s permanent naval
presence in the area. In particular,
France and Italy have agreed to provide
Russian warships (including those which are nuclear-powered) with regular access
facilities, thus highlighting the special nature of relations between
Russia and these NATO states.
The Russian military is planning to intensify exercise activity of all
services in 2008, with budget allocations for training and
operational
deployment being increased by a factor of four. In particular, the navy is
likely to maintain a high operational tempo
and intensify out-of-area prolonged
deployments. It is thought that the
group will return to the
Mediterranean in mid-2008, when the carrier will be accompanied by the
class nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser
Through the recent exercises, the Russian Navy has gained invaluable
practical experience running out-of-area carrier operations in
several maritime
theatres, a practice which was almost lost after the collapse of the Soviet
Union. This is an important development,
in light of the decision to rebuild
Russian naval power, formed around four to six carrier battle groups, and the
aim of restoring
national status of the world’s second most significant
naval power. In line with these goals, the construction of the first
new-generation nuclear-powered aircraft carriers is scheduled to commence
between 2012 and 2020.

Is ‘Customs’ a profession?
the government agency entrusted with enforcement of laws and regulations to
collect and protect import revenues, and to regulate
and document the flow of
goods in and out of the country.
The World Customs Organization
(WCO) defines Customs as
the government service which is responsible for the administration of Customs
law and the collection of import and export duties
and taxes and which also has
responsibility for the application of other laws and regulations relating, inter
alia, to the importation,
transit and exportation of goods.
term is also used as an adjective referring to officials responsible for
Customs, import and export duties, controls on goods
or any other matter within
the purview of Customs (i.e. Customs Officer, Customs duties, Customs office,
Customs declaration). So,
is Customs a profession?
In mediaeval times, only three professions were recognised: Divinity, Law and
Medicine. How does it happen that we literally have
thousands of recognised
professions? All professions begin as occupations or trades, which get
transformed into professions through
a process of professionalisation, i.e. the
shift from establishment of an activity as a full-time occupation, to
establishment of
training schools and university links, formation of a
professional association, the struggle to gain legal support for exclusion,
culminating in the formation of a professional code of ethics.
Some Customs administrations and academic institutions have recognised that
there is a distinct set of knowledge, skills and behaviours
that are needed to
serve Customs’ unique role in Government: regulating international trade
to meet national objectives. This
can only be delivered through a more
professional approach to development and career management.
Through the PICARD program (Partnership in Customs Academic Research and
Development), the WCO in cooperation with the International
Network of Customs
Universities (INCU) (
www.incu.org
) has developed Customs Professional Standards targeted at professionalising
Customs’ senior and middle management.
Published in early 2008, the PICARD Standards are being used by academic
institutions to develop educational programs, which provide
professional
qualifications in customs to Bachelor and Master level. Some of these programs
will shortly undergo a WCO accreditation
and/or approval process.
The Standards fulfil the requirements for regulated entry into the
profession. It is expected that after entering the ‘profession’
there will be a structure for continuous training and professional development,
and that there will be a code of ethics specifying
what customs clients can
expect from customs professionals.
