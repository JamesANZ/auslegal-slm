Prasad, Dipal --- "Costs Column: Can a Solicitor's Spouse Become Liable for Barristers' Fees?" [2024] PrecedentAULA 10; (2024) 180 Precedent 31
Can a solicitor’s spouse become liable for barristers’
By Dipal Prasad
Trichardt v Carmelli
a dispute over legal fees involving two plaintiffs, practising barristers, and
two defendants, the principal solicitor of MCK
Legal and her domestic partner, a
public accountant.
The plaintiffs claimed $57,030.83 for work related to the removal of a caveat
for Lifestyle Residences Hobsons Bay Pty Ltd. The defendant
solicitor disputed
the retainer and denied instructing the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged the
second defendant was also liable
based on an email. The Court determined the
solicitor’s liability for the barristers’ fees, the consequences of
contravention of costs disclosure obligations by the barristers and,
for the solicitor’s domestic partner, the enforceability
of an email as a
binding indemnity.
RETAINER AGREEMENTS: THE DANCE
The dispute revolved around the acceptance of retainer agreements by the
solicitor. The Court meticulously analysed the conduct of
the parties,
emphasising the nuanced nature of accepting retainer agreements through actions
and communication.
Magistrate Greenway discussed the legal principles applicable to the
formation of costs agreements, observing the barristers’
contention that
Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014
) applied, that is, that a costs agreement may be made
‘between a law practice and another law practice that retained that law
practice on behalf of a
The barristers
asserted that the solicitor, by her conduct, accepted the terms of their
respective costs agreements.
solicitor rebutted this by stating that she had ‘expressly rejected’
the barristers’ proposals set out in the
costs agreements and did not
provide instructions.
While it was common cause between the parties that a costs agreement may be
accepted by conduct, the Court, faced with conflicting
positions, had to
determine ‘whether the conduct of the offeree, including their silence,
would be regarded by a reasonable
bystander as signalling to the offeror that
the offer had been accepted’.
The Court scrutinised the terms of each plaintiff’s costs agreement,
focusing on cl 7 of the second plaintiff’s, which
allowed agreement to be
established by signing, electronically or by continued instruction. Despite the
solicitor’s lack of
response to the initial agreement sent on 20 October
2021, her subsequent actions, including her active participation in meetings
acknowledgment of emails, were deemed by the Court as implicit
acceptance.
Upon receiving the
second plaintiff’s costs agreement on 27 October 2021, the solicitor
expressed gratitude and indicated her
intent to forward it to the client for
consent. Crucially, she neither contested the agreement's terms nor disputed her
firm's liability
for the second plaintiff’s fees. The Court interpreted
the solicitor’s inclusion in correspondence and her attendance
client-present meetings as implicit acceptance, deeming her legally bound by the
terms of the second plaintiff’s costs
Similarly, after a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances, the Court
found that objective factors bound the solicitor to the
first plaintiff’s
costs agreement on the balance of probabilities. Notably, she acted as an
instructing solicitor in the substantial
proceeding with Lifestyle Residences
Hobsons Bay Pty Ltd, where caveat removal was an interlocutory step. The
solicitor attended
meetings on 26 October and 1 November 2021, and was copied
into various emails requesting documents, indicating her active
involvement.
In addition, the
solicitor provided documents requested by the first plaintiff, which the Court
considered a form of instruction,
contributing to her involvement in the matter.
Email exchanges between the first defendant and the first plaintiff played a
crucial role, as the defendant solicitor did not dispute
the agreement's terms
and actively participated. She attempted to attribute liability to the general
manager of Lifestyle Residences
Hobsons Bay Pty Ltd, but the barrister did not
accept this, and the solicitor did not dispute
Her lack of objection,
and inconsistencies in her evidence, contributed to the Court's conclusion that
she was indeed bound by the
barrister’s costs
The Court emphasised
that the solicitor’s inaction and failure to communicate her non-liability
for the barrister’s fees
were key factors in this determination. The Court
also clarified that ‘a solicitor may accept a barrister’s written
terms by continuing to give
instructions’.
CONSEQUENCES OF COSTS DISCLOSURE CONTRAVENTION
The defendants argued that the first plaintiff contravened his costs
disclosure obligation pursuant to
and was barred from
maintaining debt recovery proceedings pursuant to
In October 2021, the first plaintiff disclosed his estimate of total legal
costs, amounting to $82,720, inclusive of
The total legal costs
billed for services rendered between 23 October 2021 to 21 February 2022
amounted to $73,260 – well within
the disclosed estimate. Despite this,
the defendants argued that the first plaintiff violated
by not providing an updated estimate of total legal costs after a
significant change in the scope of work, given that his services
were terminated
before he was able to complete all tasks outlined in the total costs
The defendants alleged that the data in the first plaintiff’s own
material demonstrated that, as of 4 March 2022, an estimate
of his total costs
would, at the minimum, have been $112,860 (by adding fees invoiced and previous
estimates for stages of work not
yet carried
Magistrate Greenway confirmed that the barrister ‘was bound, upon any
significant change to the estimate of total legal costs
(as a matter of
fact)’ to supply the solicitor ‘with information disclosing that
change’, pursuant to
s175(2)(b).
His Honour further
explained that ‘whether there has been a “significant change”
will depend upon an assessment
of all the relevant
circumstances’.
During this assessment, his Honour found that some of the not-yet-carried-out
work was nearly complete and was included in the last
The only outstanding
tasks were reviewing the respondent’s affidavits, settling reply
affidavits and a one-day
appearance.
Given that the costs
invoiced were $9,460 less than the estimated total costs, and the Court's
calculation indicated that, if all
work was completed, the barrister’s
fees could have been $8,140 more than the total costs estimate –
representing less
than a 10% increase, the Court did not deem this change
significant.
In light of this, the barrister was not found to have violated
thereby avoiding statutory bar under
from pursuing the debt recovery
proceeding.
The Court's scrutiny demonstrates a crucial point: even if a practitioner's
fees are lower than the disclosed amount, non-compliance
with disclosure
obligations may be asserted if the retainer terminates before the practitioner
can charge their full fees which,
on objective analysis, would have exceeded the
disclosed amount. In such instances, the Court could find a failure to comply
disclosure obligations for not providing an updated estimate of total legal
costs after recognising a significant change in the scope
of work and costs.
INDEMNITY BY THE SOLICITOR'S DOMESTIC PARTNER
The barristers claim against the solicitor’s domestic partner was based
on a promise he made in an email dated 16 December 2021:
‘... I just have authorised the barristers to
proceed in removing the caveat.
Anton [Trichardt] and Monique [Hardinge], please proceed with the writ.
I will take responsibility of paying the
The second defendant denied that the email was legally enforceable. The Court
found that, for the promise to pay to be enforceable,
it had to be supported by
consideration. The ongoing work performed by the barristers in removing the
caveat was deemed sufficient
consideration, rendering the promise to pay
enforceable.
The second defendant raised a defence under
that the plaintiffs failed to provide the adequate disclosure required to be
made to him – an associated third party
payer – and so, pursuant to
, were barred from maintaining this debt recovery
proceeding.
Magistrate Greenway agreed that the defendant accountant was ‘an
associated third party payer, having become liable to the plaintiffs
for payment
of all or part of their legal costs for legal services provided’ and had
‘made payments pursuant to that
obligation’.
According to
, if a law practice is required to disclose information to a client under
, it must ‘also make the same disclosure to any associated
third party payer for the client, but only to the extent that the
matters disclosed are relevant to the associated third party payer and relate to
costs that are payable by the associated
third party payer in respect of legal
services provided to the

barristers) is not required to make a disclosure to the client under

case) under
The second law practice's obligation is limited to
disclosing to the first law practice under
With respect of the scope of the promise to pay, the barristers asserted that
it covered all their fees, both incurred and future.
The Court approached this
issue through contractual interpretation, considering the language, surrounding
circumstances and the purpose

The Court concluded

The Court then assessed the accountant’s liability for the
barristers’ legal fees. The breakdown included $22,220 to the
plaintiff for work post 16 December 2021, and $3,833.33 to the second plaintiff
for relevant items on the invoice after the

is a cautionary tale, highlighting the
intricacies of accepting retainers and fulfilling disclosure obligations in
legal relationships.
The Court's meticulous examination of conduct and
communication underscores the need for practitioners to express their intentions
explicitly. Failure to do so may not only lead to misunderstandings but also
trigger potential liabilities for fees. This tale also
unveils a unique scenario
where an instructing solicitor's domestic partner found himself entangled in a
legal web, assuming liability
for the fees of two barristers, and reveals the
far-reaching consequences of ambiguity in professional engagements.
