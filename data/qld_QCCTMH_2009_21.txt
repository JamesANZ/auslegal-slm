REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application filed under the
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act
(“the Act”) by Ms Murchison, Ms Cowley, Ms Gentry and Ms
Haywood (“the applicants”) who own manufactured
Greenbank Gardens (“the Park”), situated at 3651 Mt Lindesay
Highway, Park Ridge. They seek orders
to resolve a dispute which has arisen
with the park owner, Surtie Enterprises Pty Ltd t/a Greenbank Gardens
(“the respondent”),
as to the validity of Rule 26 of the Park Rules.
They claim that the Rule is invalid and unenforceable because it contravenes
77, 102 and 103 of the Act.
its amended Defence, the respondent claims that Rule 26 does not, as the
applicants claim, contravene the Act, and it makes a counter-claim
order that the applicants Murchison and Gentry sign a site agreement in Form 2
under the Act, in the terms proposed by
the respondent which include imposition
of Rule 26.
Tribunal has directed that it will determine on the papers the preliminary
question of law as to the validity of Rule 26 which,
pursuant to section 19 of
the Act, forms part of existing site agreements in the Park and as noted above
forms part of the proposed
site agreement which applicants Murchison and Gentry
have refused to sign. The determination is to be made on the basis of
and submissions which have been filed by the parties, which are not
contentious as regards facts relevant to the Rule 26 issue.
Evidence and submissions
evidence establishes that Rule 26 was first made prior to the commencement of
the Act in 2004 and has formed part of the Park
Rules ever since. The evidence
also establishes that in 2008 the respondent refused to address a complaint made
by a homeowner because
that complaint was made on her behalf by the Home Owners
Committee (“the HOC”), and the original letter of complaint
that it was not obliged to address the homeowner’s
complaint because of
the operation of Rule 26 which states:
“Any problems or complaints regarding the village are to
be presented to the office in writing by the manager’s
respondent interprets Rule 26 as requiring the HOC to include the original
letter of complaint when it gives notice of the complaint
to the respondent.
The applicants were members of the HOC at the time of filing of the application
and they contend that the respondent’s
interpretation of Rule 26 excludes
the operation of sections 77, 102 and 103 of the Act.
Relevant statutory provisions
statutory provisions relevant to this dispute are sections 23, 77, 102 and 103
which provide:
“23 Contracting out prohibited
(1) An agreement is void to the extent to which it purports to exclude,
change or restrict the application or operation of a provision
of this Act about
the terms of a site agreement.
(2) A person must not enter into an agreement with the intention,
directly or indirectly, of defeating the operation of this Act.
Maximum penalty—200 penalty units.
(3) In this section—

includes evading and preventing.
owner may make park rules
(1) The park owner for a residential park for which site
agreements are in force may make rules about the use, enjoyment, control
management of the park.
(2) However, rules may be made only about—
(a) the use and operation of the communal facilities; and
(b) the making and abatement of noise; and
(c) the carrying on of sporting and other recreational activities;
(d) the speed limits for motor vehicles; and
(e) the parking of motor vehicles; and
(f) the disposal of refuse; and
(g) the keeping of pets; and
(h) other things prescribed under a regulation.
Committee’s
The function of a home owners committee for a residential park
is to deal with the park owner on behalf of the home owners about—
(a) the day-to-day running of the park; and
(b) any complaint or proposal about the operation of the park raised by
the home owners.
103 Park owner to respond to complaint or proposal
If a home owners committee for a residential park gives the park owner a
notice detailing a complaint or proposal mentioned in section
102(b), the park
owner must within 21 days after receiving the notice give the committee a
written response addressing the complaint
or proposal.
Maximum penalty—20 penalty units.”
Discussion and
19 of the Act provides that park rules are terms of a site agreement. Section
23(2) has the effect that any park rule which
excludes the application of a
provision of the Act is void.
26 was not invalid at the time it was made because the predecessor of the Act,
the former Mobile Homes Act 1989, did not contain
any provisions about park
rules. However, in the Tribunal’s view, Rule 26 has been rendered invalid
by the commencement of
the Act because it does not fall within one of the
categories of rules which may be made under section 77(2). The limited
specified in section 77(2) are the “only” categories
permitted. Section 77(1) does not oblige a park owner to make any
rules, but if
the park owner chooses to do so, rules “may only be made about” the
subject matter specified in section
respondent, in reliance upon an earlier decision of the Tribunal,
, relating to
this Park, argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of a park
rule which was made prior to the introduction
of the Act in 2004. However, the
decision in MH020-04 can be distinguished on its facts. The Park Rules
regarding the riding of
bikes and skateboards and speed limits in the Park which
were under discussion in that decision were also made before the commencement
the Act but, significantly, were not affected by the Act because the contentious
rules fell within categories authorised under
section 77 of the Act. The
learned Member in that case made no finding as to the validity of the
contentious pre-2004 Rules because
of insufficiency of evidence, and any general
comment which the learned Member made about the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to
the validity of a pre-2004 park rule must be seen as being directed to
the facts of that case.
Tribunal finds that Rule 26 is invalid because it does not fall within the
limited categories of park rules which may be made
under section 77(2), but the
Rule is, in the Tribunal’s view, not invalid on the further ground that,
in terms of section 23(2),
it defeats the operation of sections 102 and 103. On
its face, Rule 26 merely deals with the procedure under which a complaint is
be presented by a homeowner to the respondent. It says nothing about the
entity who may make a complaint. It does not say that
the respondent will only
respond to a written complaint made directly to it by a homeowner. It also does
not say that the respondent
will not respond to a written complaint made on a
the respondent’s interpretation of the express words of Rule 26 is invalid
in the Tribunal’s view because that
interpretation defeats the operation
of the Act in terms of section 23(2) by excluding the right of the HOC, under
section 103 to
make a complaint on behalf of a homeowner without providing to
the respondent a copy of the original complaint of the homeowner made
HOC. Section 103 requires the HOC to give the park owner a notice
“detailing a complaint”, but does not state
that a copy of the
original letter of complaint must be provided. Furthermore, there is nothing in
section 103 from which such a
requirement can be implied.
the Act any homeowner has the choice of making their complaint about the
operation of the Park to the HOC and having the HOC
deal with their complaint
with the park owner on their behalf; or alternatively, if the homeowner does not
wish to deal directly
with the park owner, the homeowner can ask the HOC to act
on the homeowner’s behalf under section 102. In the latter circumstance,
section 103 obliges the park owner to respond to the complaint or proposal made
by the HOC on a homeowner’s behalf without
requiring the HOC to provide to
the park owner a copy of the original complaint or proposal made to the HOC.
The respondent in such
circumstances is not entitled under section 103, to
require the homeowner who raised the complaint with the HOC to address the
directly to it. The purpose of the complaints procedure under the Act
is clearly to prevent the identity of the complainant homeowner
disclosed to the park owner if the homeowner so chooses.
though Rule 26 is invalid because it contravenes section 77, there is nothing in
the Act, in the Tribunal’s view, which
prevents the respondent from
including a special term in a site agreement which provides, similarly to Rule
26, that if a homeowner
chooses to make a complaint directly to the respondent,
rather than through the HOC, then such complaint must be in writing and directed
to the manager’s mail box.
the premises the Tribunal makes the following order:
that Rule 26 does not fall within the limited categories of Park Rules permitted
under section 77(2) of the Act and is therefore
invalid and of no effect.
