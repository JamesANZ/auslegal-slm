TRIBUNAL REQUIREMENTS
4. The Tribunal is required under
sections 45
Mental Health
(Forensic Provisions) Act, 1990
(the Act), where the patient has been found
unfit to be tried, to consider the fitness of the patient to be tried. Where the
is of the opinion that the patient has become fit to be tried or has
not become fit to be tried, and will not, during the period
of 12 months after
the finding of unfitness by the Court, become fit to be tried, the Tribunal must
notify the Court and the Director
of Public Prosecutions.
5. As Mr Underhill is detained, the Tribunal is also required to conduct a
review under section 46 of the Act and may make orders
as to the patient’s
continued detention, care or treatment or the patient’s release.
6. The Act has special evidentiary requirements in relation to leave or
release which must be satisfied before the Tribunal can grant
leave or release.
In view of this, the Tribunal requires notice of applications for leave or
release to ensure that the necessary
evidence is available. This process also
enables the Tribunal to provide notice of such applications to the Minister for
Mental Health,
the Attorney General, and any registered victims who are entitled
to make submissions concerning any proposed leave or release. No
notice of an
application for leave or release was provided to the Tribunal prior to this
7. Without limiting any other matters the Tribunal may consider, the Tribunal
must consider the principles of care and treatment under
Mental Health Act 2007
as well as the following matters under section 74
of the Act when determining what order to make:
(a) whether the person is suffering from a mental illness or other mental
(b) whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that care,
treatment or control of the person is necessary for the person’s
protection from serious harm or the protection of others from serious harm,
(c) the continuing condition of the person, including any likely
deterioration in the person’s condition, and the likely effects
such deterioration,

PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
10. The Tribunal notes that the treating team’s current proposal for Mr
Underhill to be detained at the specialist aged care
[facility] was raised at
the last review hearing. At that time the Tribunal indicated that it would need
to receive more information
care facility] to form a view about its appropriateness as a place of detention.
11. A preliminary issue at this hearing was whether Mr Underhill had a view
detained at the [aged
care facility]. His lawyer, Mr Hair, advised that although he had been able to
communicate in English with
Mr Underhill 12 months ago, he was now unable to do
so and he had not been able to obtain instructions from Mr Underhill about the
proposed move. Dr A expressed the view that, in view of Mr Underhill’s
condition, he would not have a real understanding of
the proposed move. The
family advised that they were supportive of the move.
12. The Tribunal made a number of attempts at the beginning of the hearing,
through the interpreter, to elicit Mr Underhill’s
views about the proposed
move, but this was unsuccessful. The interpreter told the Tribunal that he was
unlikely to be of assistance
at the hearing, as Mr Underhill did not respond to
his attempts to communicate with him. The interpreter considered that Mr
Underhill’s
family, who were present in the hearing, might be of more
assistance. Whilst the inherent awkwardness of using telephone interpreter
services was likely to be a factor, Mr Underhill appeared to have very little
understanding of what was happening throughout the
hearing and this was broadly
consistent with the treating team’s reports concerning the recent
deterioration in his condition.
VICTIMS IMPACT STATEMENT
13. The Tribunal noted at the hearing that it had read and considered the
Victim Impact Statement from [a victim].
14. The Tribunal had reports from Dr A, Staff Specialist Psychiatrist and Ms
B, Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC) [mental health service
for older people].
There was also a report from Ms D, Clinical Nurse Consultant [aged care
15. Dr A reports that Mr Underhill has a diagnosis of a major neurocognitive
disorder most likely secondary to mixed vascular/Alzheimer
amyloid angiopathy. He has behavioural and psychological symptoms associated
with dementia. He remains unfit due
to his severe dementia. Dr A reports that he
reviewed Mr Underhill on [date] with consideration of the
criteria and he could not understand any of the questions.
16. In evidence Dr A reported that Mr Underhill’s deterioration both
physically and cognitively has been particularly noted
in the past two to three
weeks. On [date] Mr Underhill had “...walked unaided into the interview
room and he sat and smiled
and laughed and I think I got an “OK”
from him, but 10 days later there is no speech and he requires a lot of physical
support.” In his report Dr A notes that patients with vascular dementia
diagnosed after age 65 have a median survival expectancy
of 3 to 5 years and
that Mr Underhill has a poor prognosis, as there are no effective treatments for
17. In relation to treatment, Dr A gave evidence that Mr Underhill had been
on a very low dose of anti-psychotic medication for behavioral
issues associated
with dementia, but in view of the sedation and lack of ongoing behavioral issues
this had been recently stopped
and there had been no episodes of aggression or
untoward behavior. He is being investigated for raised liver tests and they are
the results of a recent ultrasound test. He also has cardiac failure
and the liver test results may reflect liver congestion secondary
failure and they hope to have a better understanding of this with the further
18. Dr A provides a risk assessment and concludes that Mr Underhill falls
into a group of persons with a risk of physical endangerment
to others that is
low in a supervised environment. Dr A considers that the intervention required
to manage his care would cover the
risks he poses to others. “With
treatment and rehabilitation in a secure nursing home environment his current
risk management
needs could be met.” Dr A also reports that Mr Underhill
will continue to decline physically and this will further reduce his
19. Dr A gave evidence that he considers that a dedicated secure nursing home
would be a far more appropriate and humane environment
appropriate to Mr
Underhill’s condition, as he would have access to specialist programs such
as occupational therapy, diversional
therapy and physiotherapy, and more family
visits. This contrasts with his current detention in prison, where he is locked
cell 18 hours per day without access to the specialist programs and with
limited family visits.
20. Dr A also noted that from a medical viewpoint [aged care facility] is
well serviced by a specialist on-site geriatrician, Dr C,
general practitioners
and specialist nursing staff experienced in dementia care. His main care need
relates to his dementia and this
can best be met in a specialist dementia
setting like [aged care facility].
21. Ms B gave evidence that she agreed with Dr A’s assessment and
confirmed that Mr Underhill is deteriorating quickly and that
she had had
difficulty the day before the hearing getting him into a wheel chair as he could
not understand or follow directions.
In her report Ms B notes that since the
last Tribunal review hearing Mr Underhill has become very lethargic, with little
spontaneous
interaction with others and that he remains disoriented to place and
time. Nursing staff now put him to bed at night and he requires
full assistance
to shower and dress and requires supervision and help with meals.
22. Ms D’s report specifically addresses the conditions identified by
Her Honour Justice Schmidt in
, relevant to detention in an aged care facility. In particular Ms D
reports that [aged care facility] is a NSW Health facility affiliated
hospital]. It is a secure environment and residents are not free to leave unless
supervised. There are clear escalation measures
if a resident were to elude
staff including (if necessary) involving local Police and the Police Dog Unit.
The unit is covered by
high level nursing management and monitoring 24 hours per
23. Dr C from the [aged care facility] gave evidence that he had assessed Mr
Underhill as suitable for the [aged care facility] as
Mr Underhill primarily has
a dementia illness. On the issue of security Dr C gave evidence that Mr
Underhill would be detained at
[aged care facility] which is a secure setting
with locked key pad entry doors that only staff have the codes to. There are
surrounded by high fencing which is not scalable. There is also a
good ratio of nursing and care support staff and they are assisted
by Health and
Security Assistance (HASA) staff present 24 hours per day.
24. Dr C also gave evidence that [the aged care facility] has access to a
[health service] from [a hospital] with specialist clinicians
who can provide
hospital-like medical care at [aged care facility] if needed.
25. Having regard to Mr Underhill’s particular circumstances, Dr C
considers that he could be securely detained at the [aged
care facility]. The
[aged care facility] has appropriate escalation protocols in place to pursue and
detain anyone who might manage
to get past security, but this has not happened
26. The Tribunal noted that any proposal for Mr Underhill to have leave from
[aged care facility] would need to be specifically considered
at a further
27. Mr E spoke on behalf of the family to thank the treating team and
everyone involved in Mr Underhill’s care.
DETERMINATION
28. It is clear from the evidence and from Mr Underhill’s appearance
before the Tribunal that he has a serious deteriorating
condition affecting his
physical and psychological health. The primary health issues relate to his
dementia, which is untreatable
and deteriorating, and cardiac failure. The
Tribunal accepts the evidence that Mr Underhill has a poor prognosis and a
life expectancy. He remains unfit for trial and will not become
29. The Tribunal is satisfied that the current care and detention
arrangements within the prison are clearly not appropriate to meet
Underhill’s current high care needs and that these needs will only
increase over time. Mr Underhill has been assessed by
Dr A and by Dr C, who are
aged care specialists, as being an appropriate candidate for the detention and
care arrangements offered
by the [aged care facility].
30. In making a determination for Mr Underhill to be detained at the [aged
care facility] for care and treatment the Tribunal must
be satisfied, having
[2019] NSWSC 529
[aged care facility] is capable of detaining him and that it has appropriate
security and other protocols in place to both
prevent his escape and to take all
necessary steps to return him to [aged care facility] in the unlikely event that
he were to elude
staff and leave [aged care facility]. The Tribunal is satisfied
on the evidence that [aged care facility] is an appropriate place
of detention
for Mr Underhill. He will not be free to leave and it is a locked secure
environment with specialist medical and security
staff well equipped to deal
with the care and behavioural issues associated with dementia patients. The
Tribunal accepts that Mr
Underhill’s risk can be managed within that
environment and that his deteriorating condition will further reduce any risk he
poses over time.
31. In all the circumstances the Tribunal is satisfied that the [aged care
facility] is an appropriate place of detention for Mr Underhill
and the Tribunal
orders that he be detained there for care and treatment as soon as a place
becomes available for him.
