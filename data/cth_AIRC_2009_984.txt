DEPUTY PRESIDENT IVES
MELBOURNE, 22 DECEMBER 2009
Termination of employment – jurisdiction – 100 or fewer employees.
Mr Alex Rotaru (the Applicant) lodged an application, pursuant to
Workplace Relations Act 1996
(Cth) (the Act) on 17 July 2009, alleging that the termination of his employment by Rusa Pty Ltd (the Respondent) was a harsh, unjust
or unreasonable termination and an unlawful termination of employment within the meaning of the Act.
In a Notice of Motion (Form R29) dated 16 October 2009 the Respondent sought to have the Applicant’s application dismissed
on the basis that the Respondent, at the time of the termination of the Applicant’s employment, was an employer employing 100
or fewer employees hence excluded from the operation of
ss.643(1)(a)
(harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination) of the Act by force of
subsections 643(10)
In support of its Notice of Motion the Respondent filed with the Commission an Affidavit of 16 October 2009 deposed by Ms Valerie
Keem in the following terms:
“1. I am the Human Resources Manager for the Respondent.
2. I have been performing this role for the Respondent since May 1
3. I am responsible for all of the functions that deal with the needs and activities of the Respondent’s employees. I report
directly to the General Manager.
4. On 18 June 2009 (“the relevant date”), the Respondent employed less than 100 employees in accordance with
Section 643(10)
Workplace Relations Act 1996
5. On the relevant date, the Respondent employed (including the Applicant) 72 full time, part time and casual employees of greater
than 12 months employment with the Respondent.
6. On the relevant date, the Respondent employed 21 casuals that had not been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for at least
7. Now produced and shown to me is a copy of the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet (“the Spreadsheet”) I produced on 25
June 2009 listing all employees of the Respondent on the relevant date. The Spreadsheet is attachment “VK-1”.
8. The Respondent does not have any related bodies corporate within the meaning of
Corporations Act 2001
Subsequent to a conciliation conference, the Commission sent a letter (with attachments) dated 18 December 2009 to the Applicant.
The last three paragraphs of that letter are reproduced below:
“Should you wish to contest the subject matter of the material filed by the Respondent, the Commission directs you to file with
the Melbourne Registry of the Commission and serve upon the Respondent, no later than close of business on Wednesday 23 December
2009 any or all materials that you rely upon in mounting such a contest.
The Commission will consider the Respondent’s materials and any further materials that you provide and may determine the question
of jurisdiction relating to the above provisions of the Act “on the papers”.
You are advised that should the Commission determine the question of jurisdiction in favour of the Respondent your application, insofar
as it relates to
ss.643(1)(a)
of the Act, will be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.”
The Applicant’s representative responded on 21 December 2009 in the following terms:
“We write with reference to your letter dated 18 December 2009.
Please be advised that we have been instructed not to contest the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection in relation to the application
Section 643(1)(a).
Subsections 643(10)
, (11) and (12) of the Act relevantly provide as follows:
“(10) An application under subsection (1) must not be made on the ground referred to in paragraph (1)(a), or on grounds that
include that ground, if, at the relevant time, the employer employed 100 employees or fewer, including:
(a) the employee whose employment was terminated; and
(b) any casual employee who had been engaged by the employer on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months;
but not including any other casual employee.
(11) For the purposes of calculating the number of employees employed by an employer as mentioned in subsection (10), related bodies
corporate (within the meaning of
Corporations Act 2001
) are taken to be one entity.
(12) For the purposes of subsection (10):
relevant time
is the time when the employer gave the employee the notice of termination, or the time when the employer terminated the employee’s
employment, whichever happened first; and
(b) for the purposes of calculating the number of employees employed by the employer,
has the same meaning as in paragraph (b) of the definition of that term in
section 636.
Determination
I have considered the material before me and conclude that the Respondent is excluded from the operation of
ss.643(1)(a)
of the Act by force of the subsections referred to above.
The Applicant’s application, insofar as it relates to
ss.643(1)(a)
of the Act, is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
An order giving effect to this decision is issued as
A certificate pursuant to s.650 of the Act will now issue in relation to the Applicant’s application insofar as it relates
to unlawful termination.
