PLACE: Brisbane
DECISION: The Tribunal affirms the decision under review that the Applicant be
refused the grant of a Class 816 (special (permanent))
entry permit and a Class
818 (highly skilled on-shore (permanent) entry permit).
THE APPLICATION
On 4 December 1995 SYF (the Applicant) applied to this Tribunal for review of a
decision to refuse to grant him a Class 816 (special
(permanent)) entry permit.
His application for the entry permit was lodged with the then Department of
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
(the Department) on 14 July 1994 and was refused
on 15 August 1995. That decision was affirmed by the Migration Internal Review
Office (MIRO) on 3 November 1995.
The Applicant has applied for a determination of refugee status. This Tribunal
determines that it is in the public interest to restrict
the publication of the
Applicant's name and details that could be used to identify him.
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
As a result of the
Migration Reform Act 1992
Migration Reform
(Transitional Provisions) Regulations
which accompanied that Act, the
application in this case is to be decided according to the criteria that
applied to the entry permit
for which application was originally made, which
are found in the Migration (1993) Regulations (the Regulations).
The criteria for a Class 816 entry permit are set out in Part 816 of Schedule 2
of the Regulations. They provide so far as is relevant
to this application:
816.72 Criteria to be satisfied at time of application (entry permit - after
816.721(1) The applicant is:
(a) a person who:
(i) had not turned 45 before 1 November 1993; and
(ii) meets the requirements of subclause (2) or (3); and
(iii) meets the requirements of subclause (4) or (6); or
(2) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if, on 1 November
(b) the applicant:
(i) held an overseas technical qualification or general academic qualification
that is assessed by NOOSR as being comparable to an
Australian associate
diploma, diploma, degree, or higher degree; or
(ii) held an overseas trade qualification, or had work experience, that is
assessed as meeting Australian education or training standards
for that trade:
(A) by the Department of Industrial Relations; or
(B) if that Department is unable to make an assessment, by the State or
Territory authority that the Minister decides is appropriate;
(C) if neither that Department nor that State or Territory authority is able to
make an assessment, by the Minister;
(c) the applicant:
(i) had been enrolled during the 1993 academic year in an accredited course
leading to a trade certificate, advanced certificate,
associate diploma,

(ii) had met the academic progress requirements of the institution at which he
or she was enrolled.
(4) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if:
(a) the applicant applied in accordance with subclause (5) for a determination
that the applicant was a refugee (whether or not the
application has been
withdrawn, and whether or not the application, if not withdrawn, has been

if made, was adverse to the
applicant) ...
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a), an application for a determination
that the applicant is a refugee:
(a) must have been recorded by Immigration as having been received by
Immigration on or before 1 November 1993; and
(b) if the application was recorded by Immigration as having been received on
or after 1 February 1993 - must have been made on the
approved form.
816.722(1) If the applicant is a principal person, he or she is in Australia
816.723 If the applicant is a principal person, on 1 November 1993 he or she
either was in Australia or was the holder of a return

(a) was granted a visa (of any class) overseas on or before 12 March 1992; and
(b) used that visa to travel to, and enter, Australia on or before 1 November
The application under review was also for a Class 818 entry permit, the
criteria for which are set out in Part 818 of Schedule 2
of the Regulations
(the Schedule). The Tribunal does not propose to set out those criteria here
as it has not been argued by the
Applicant that he is able to satisfy them.
The Tribunal has before it the relevant Departmental file and also received
further information and written submissions from and
on behalf of the
Applicant. The Applicant attended a hearing of this matter on 20 August 1996.
An interpreter was present to assist
the parties.
Material on the Departmental file records that:
* the Applicant was born on 19 October 1955 and he is divorced. His mother and
2 siblings reside in China. He completed his schooling
* in 1975 the Applicant was awarded a certificate of graduation after
completing a two year course at a
"metallurgical equipment manufacturing
course in his home country;
* that certificate has been assessed by the National Office of Overseas Skills
Recognition (NOOSR) as comparable to a TAFE Certificate
(Stream 3200);
* the Applicant travelled to Australia as the holder of a valid visa on 4
February 1990;
* the Applicant has not completed any studies in Australia and was not enrolled
in a tertiary or other post secondary course as at
1 November 1993; and
* the Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) Secretariat of the Department
records state that the Applicant made an application for
refugee status on 22
October 1990.
* in his application form he stated that he worked as a
Golden Circle Cannery at Northgate.
During the course of this review the Applicant provided further material to the
Tribunal concerning his work in the field of
in his home
country. On the basis of that material, the Tribunal sought an assessment of
his trade qualifications and experience
from the Department of Industrial
Relations (DIR) and Trades Recognition Australia (TRA). By letter dated
24 February 1997 DIR advised
the Applicant that it did not assess the
Applicant's occupation.
On 15 May 1997 Skills Recognition Training Queensland advised that it did not
assess the Applicant's occupation. On 12 September
1997 the Vocational
Training Board from the New South Wales Department of Training and Education
(DTEC) requested references from
the Applicant regarding his work.
Further correspondence passed in this matter. In November 1998 the Tribunal
was advised by DTEC that the Applicant did not satisfy
the Australian
requirements for his occupation in
The Tribunal again contacted the Applicant regarding his application. On 12
January 1999 the Tribunal was informed by an acquaintance
of the Applicant that
he had spoken to him and that a decision be made in this matter.
From the evidence and material before it, the Tribunal finds that the Applicant
had not turned 45 before 1 November 1993, and therefore
satisfies clause
816.721(1)(a)(i) of the Regulations.
The Applicant's application for a determination that he was a refugee was
recorded by the Department as having been received on 22
October 1990, and
therefore before 1 November 1993. He thus satisfies clause 816.721(4)(a) of
the Regulations.
The Tribunal also finds that the Applicant was granted a visa outside Australia
before 12 March 1992 and used that visa to travel
to and enter Australia before
1 November 1993. He was in Australia on 1 November 1993 and has remained in
Australia since that time.
He therefore satisfies clauses 816.722, 816.723 and
816.724 of the Regulations.
For the Applicant to satisfy clause 816.721 he must meet the requirements of
subclause (2) or (3) of that clause. Those provisions
are set out in full
above. The evidence before the Tribunal on these matters is that the Applicant
does not have any academic qualification
which would satisfy the requirements
of clause 816.721(2), or that he had any relevant business interest for the
purposes of subclause
(3). His case to the Tribunal has been that he meets
subclause 816.721 (2)(b)(ii), which requires a favourable assessment of the
Applicant's trade qualifications or work experience assessed by the
Commonwealth Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) or an appropriate
As indicated above, DTEC's assessment of the Applicant's qualifications and
work experience is that he does not meet the requirements
for trade recognition
in Australia. As there is no other evidence of a favourable assessment of the
Applicant's trade qualifications,
the Tribunal finds that clause 816.721(2) is
not satisfied, and that the Applicant is therefore unable to satisfy the
criteria for
the grant of a Class 816 entry permit.
To satisfy the requirements for a Class 818 entry permit, the Applicant must
demonstrate that he has obtained a bachelor's degree
or postgraduate
qualification in Australia prior to 1 November 1993 or was enrolled in a degree
course during the 1993 academic year.
As the evidence is that the Applicant
has not enrolled in or completed any such qualification in Australia, the
Tribunal finds that
he is unable to satisfy the criteria necessary for the
grant of a Class 818 visa.
An applicant to succeed for the entry permit a visa applied for needs to
satisfy all of the relevant prescribed criteria. Failure
to do so results in
the entry permit or visa not being granted. It may be that the application
fails for other reasons e.g. the
applicant not having passed the STEP test,
however given the Tribunal's findings above it is not necessary to consider
this matter
The Tribunal affirms the decision under review that the Applicant be refused
the grant of a Class 816 (special (permanent)) entry
