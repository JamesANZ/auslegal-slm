t/a Dalkeith Caravan Park
Residents: Shaun Montebello and Jaclyn

Rent: $173.50 per week
Security Bond: $694.00 was paid by the residents and lodged with the
Commissioner for Consumer Affairs (Bond No. 7000436-3)
I find that there was a Residential Park Tenancy Agreement on the
abovementioned terms which is subject to the
Residential Parks Act, 2007
(“the Act”).
At the hearing of this matter Robert Flett represented the Dalkeith Caravan
Park and gave sworn evidence. One of the former park residents,
Montebello, also gave sworn evidence.
Mr Flett identified claims totalling $655.95 against the former residents
comprised of $520.50 for rent arrears and loss of rental
income, $63.00 for
cleaning and $72.45 for electricity accounts. I will deal with these claims as
Rent Arrears and Loss of Rental Income
Mr Flett gave evidence that there was a written Residential Parks Agreement
between the parties for the period 8 May 2008 to 7 August
2008. He stated about
4.00 pm on 7 July 2008 Mr Montebello attended the park office and stated he was
vacating his cabin. Mr Flett
told Mr Montebello the agreement imposed certain
obligations on residents which Mr Montebello needed to consider before vacating
his cabin. In order to point out those obligations Mr Flett took the agreement
from his filing cabinet and handed it to Mr Montebello.
Flett’s request that the agreement not be removed from the office Mr
Montebello took the agreement to his car stating
that he wanted to compare Mr
Flett's copy of the agreement with his copy. After he had returned to his car Mr
Flett observed Mr
Montebello destroying Mr Flett's copy of the agreement. After
some discussion with the resident’s father, who was also in
the car, it
was agreed that Mr Montebello senior would return within the next "day or two"
to clean the cabin.
Mr Montebello tendered his copy of the agreement which has been signed by the
park owners but not the residents. He suggested that
the absence of the
residents' signature on his copy of the agreement was evidence that his
signature on Mr Flett’s copy of
the agreement had been forged. Mr Flett
denied that the residents’ signature had been forged and stated that there
no reason for anyone to forge the signatures. I do not accept Mr
Montebello’s evidence that his signature on the Residential
Agreement had been forged. I am satisfied the residents did sign the Park Owners
copy of the agreement.
The parties agreed that when Mr Montebello and Ms Winkless vacated the
property the rent was paid to 2 July 2008. Mr Flett said that
advertise the cabin vacated by the residents, however he was able to secure a
new resident as from 24 July 2008. Although
I am satisfied that the property was
relet within a reasonable time I note that, pursuant to
of the Act,
the law of contract relating to mitigation for loss or damage on breach of a
contract apply to a breach of a Residential
Park Agreement. Accordingly if a
resident abandons a rented property which is not re-tenanted within a reasonable
time the owner
may be required to show that he has taken active steps to find a
new resident. I find on the evidence that the residents are indebted
to the park
owner for 21 days rent which amounts to $520.50. There will be an order in
favour of the park owner for this amount.
Mr Flett gave evidence that despite Mr Montebello senior spending “many
hours at the cabin clearing and cleaning” the
oven tray still required
cleaning and the curtains needed to be washed as they had a “rancid
smell”. The shower alcove
also required cleaning as did the floor under
the refrigerator. Mr Flett said he spent 3.5 hours cleaning the cabin. Mr
gave evidence there was some mould above the bedroom door which had
been painted over. He stated the other areas of the cabin had
been cleaned. I
note however that he did not see the cabin after it had been cleaned by his
father. Although there is no final inspection
report before the Tribunal, I
accept Mr Flett’s evidence that some cleaning was still required after it
was cleaned by Mr Montebello
Senior. After reviewing the evidence, I will allow
three hours cleaning, which at a rate of $17.50 per hour, amounts to $52.50.
Electricity Accounts
Mr Flett gave evidence that each cabin is fitted with its own power meter
which is read each Sunday to coincide with the rental period.
He did not however
tender any readings or other evidence in support of his claim for electricity
usage between 15 June 2008 and 6
July 2008. Mr Montebello conceded that he had
not paid the electricity account for the period 29 June 2008 to 6 July 2008 in
sum of $20.95 but disputed the balance of the park owner's claim. In the
absence of evidence as to meter readings, electricity accounts
or other evidence
to support the balance of the owner's claim there will be an order in favour of
the owner for $20.95, being the
amount conceded by Mr Montebello.
In summary, the park owner has established claims totalling $593.95 against
the former residents comprised of $520.50 for rent arrears
and loss of rental
income, $52.50 for cleaning and $20.95 for electricity usage. The security bond
will be apportioned accordingly.
Pursuant to
Section 116(j)
of the Act, I order that the security bond of
$694.00 held by the Commissioner (Bond No. 7000436-3) be paid in the sum of
to the park owner and in the sum of $100.05 to the former
