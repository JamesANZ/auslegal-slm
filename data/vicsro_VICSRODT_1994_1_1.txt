Adoption of Australian Taxation Office debits tax rulings (DT-001) [1994] VICSRODT 1 (28 February 1994)
Revenue Rulings
Debits tax was first imposed by the Federal
government in 1982. The responsibility for debits
tax was transferred to the States in 1991. This
transfer to the State of Victoria was facilitated
through the enactment of the
Debits Tax Act 1990
(the Act). However, the administration and
collection of debits tax remained with the Federal
government. The Australian Taxation Office
collects and administers the debits tax on behalf of
the States.
From 1 January 1994, the Australian Taxation
Office will cease to collect and administer debits
tax on behalf of the States. In Victoria, the State
Revenue Office will assume the role of collecting
and administering debits tax from that date.
This ruling addresses the adoption of rulings
issued by the Australian Taxation Office relating to
debits tax.
To facilitate the hand-over of the collection and
administration of debits tax from the Australian
Taxation Office to the State Revenue Office, the
Commissioner of State Revenue will adopt all rulings
issued by the Australian Taxation Office which relate
to debits tax.
This will apply to all of the debits tax rulings issued by
the Australian Taxation Office which are in effect as
at 31 December 1993.
The State Revenue Office will progressively issue
rulings to replace those of the Commonwealth for the
purposes of the Victorian legislation.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be read
subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
