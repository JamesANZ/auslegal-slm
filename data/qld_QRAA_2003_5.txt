: 13 February 2003
Neil McMullen
APPEAL FROM
A decision by the Stewards of
the Queensland Harness Racing Board to suspend his driver’s licence for a
period of 4 weeks.
BREACH OF RULE
APPEARANCES
: Mr David Goddard with the approval of the
Authority appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr Norm Torpey Chairman
of Stewards appeared on behalf of the Queensland Harness Racing
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an appeal by Mr John
Neil McMullen against a decision of the Stewards of the Queensland Harness
Racing Board to suspend his
driver’s licence for 4 weeks after finding
that he breached Rule 149(2) of the Rules of Harness Racing.
Rule 149(2)
“A person shall not drive in a manner which in the
opinion of the Stewards is unacceptable.”
“new” rule being approved by the Australian Harness Racing Council
on 25 October 2002 and the publication of
its introduction appearing in the
January/February Queensland Harness Racing magazine.
The reference to it
as a “new” rule is strictly not correct. It is probably best for it
to be referred to as a reinstated
rule as it was the former Rule
The charging of Mr McMullen under this rule arose from Mr
McMullen’s driving of Melton Multimax in Race 4 at Toowoomba Paceway
Thursday 30 January 2003. Mr McMullen is also the trainer of Melton Multimax.
The horse was one of the favourites with odds
of $1.60. During the race it
became “boxed in” by a horse being driven by Mr Peter Greig and the
Stewards held an inquiry
into Mr McMullen’s driving tactics and in
particular the reason why he did not pull his horse out at the 800 metre point
being “boxed in” by Mr Greig.
Mr McMullen stated at
the inquiry and through Mr Goddard at the hearing that he was endeavouring to
ease Melton Multimax out, but
could not because of the speed in which Mr Greig
came up on his outside. He said he did not proceed with coming out because he
concerned with coming in contact with the legs of Mr Greig’s horse.
The Stewards position is simply that Mr McMullen should have pulled his
horse out before Mr Greig had the opportunity to come up on
the outside.
There was a discussion in relation to Rule 149(2) at the Stewards
inquiry between Mr McMullen, Mr Cressey, who was the Chairman of
Steward’s panel and Mr Adams in the following terms:
MCMULLEN: Is this a new rule, sir?
THE CHAIRMAN: It is a new rule,
MR MCMULLEN: Which rescinds the old rule. What sort of difference
is there with these rules?
THE CHAIRMAN: Well, there is a slight
difference. Obviously it may vary in penalty. We would advise that one is
probably more severe
than the other. Rule 149(1) is probably a rule where - and
that deals with reasonable and permissible measures.
I think you have
been charged under that rule previously. This is - I don’t like saying a
lesser version of that rule, but
it is associated with that rule, but in a more
lenient light. Is that correct, Mr Adams?
MR ADAMS: Yes. I would have
the interpretation of saying to you, you didn’t make a move - and
that’s all Mr Cressey
is actually charging you under. It is something you
didn’t do rather than - the other rule is something that you may have
that might have taken a toll on your horse. That is how I have interpreted
MR MCMULLEN: So, had I come out - I could have easily come out and
pushed Peter Greig off the track, and that rule is the push-out
whatever it is - and that’s like obviously a 2 week suspension?
CHAIRMAN: More than likely, yes.
MR MCMULLEN: So I would have been
– what’s the penalty for this rule?
THE CHAIRMAN: We would
have to discuss it between ourselves in relation to penalty. In all honesty, I
don’t know if this rule
has actually been used before.
The rule was applicable in the early - then it was revoked and now it has bee
re-gazetted. The rule has only come back
in within the last 2 months, in my
understanding. It was definitely - there had been other drivers charged
previously under this
rule before it was revoked.”
Goddard’s submission as to why Mr McMullen was not in breach of the rule
related to:
the facts of the
Mr Peter Greig’s
driving tactics, and;
the conduct of
the Stewards at the inquiry.
Firstly, in relation to the
submissions concerning the conduct of the Stewards at the inquiry Mr Goddard
submitted that Mr Greig should
have been examined as a witness and that the
failure to call him by the Stewards was in breach of Rule 256. The Authority
accept that submission nor that the Stewards inquiry was in any way
conducted improperly or in breach of Rule 256. Indeed as this
is a re-hearing
Mr McMullen could have had Mr Greig appear if he had felt his appearance was
required to properly present his case.
Secondly, in relation to Mr
Greig’s driving tactics, while Mr McMullen may have felt aggrieved in
being “boxed in”
by Mr Greig, the Authority is of the opinion that
Mr Greig’s actions had no real bearing on whether Mr McMullen was in
of Rule 149(2).
The crux of this matter is whether the Stewards
are right in their assertion that Mr McMullen should have pulled his horse out
to Mr Greig moving his horse up to his outside.
In this regard Mr
Torpey produced at the hearing not only a video of the race, but also a video of
a previous race run that day at
Toowoomba. Mr Torpey asked the Authority to
take into account that in the previous race the driver pulled his horse out to
the possibility of being “boxed in”. Mr Torpey submitted that
the Stewards were correct to expect the same of Mr McMullen
in his driving of
Melton Multimax.
Mr Torpey also had shown at the hearing a video of the
previous run of Melton Multimax which was a race at Albion Park where the horse
was pulled out and easily went around the other horses to win the race. Mr
Torpey submitted that this past run showed the horse’s
ability to cover
the field and was relied on by the Stewards when they found that Mr McMullen had
breached Rule 149(2).
While the Authority can see the Stewards point
that if Mr McMullen would have pulled the horse out at the 800 metre point it
given the horse a clear run, the question is whether his failure to do
so in the circumstances of this matter constitute a breach
of Rule 149(2). Mr
Greig’s horse certainly came up as McMullen refers to “hard and
fast” and it does appear that
Mr McMullen was trying to ease out but the
speed at which Mr Greig’s horse came up did not give Mr McMullen the
opportunity
to continue to do so without their being possible contact between
the horses.
Mr Torpey has submitted that Mr McMullen should have
foreseen Mr Greig’s actions. The Authority is not of that opinion. It
noted that Mr Greig’s horse faded and finished last and it does appear
that it was under pressure when it came up outside
Certainly with the benefit of hindsight of knowing that Mr
Greig would have drove his horse the way he did, Mr McMullen may well have
pulled the horse out sooner.
The Authority, however, believes for there
to be a breach of Rule 149(2) that more is required than in the circumstances
that occurred
in this matter.
The appeal is allowed and the appeal
deposit fee is to be refunded to the
