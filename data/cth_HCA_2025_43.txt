Introduction
the law of obligations, the "two simple ideas from which the common law started"
were "two kinds of legal claim: the demand for
a right and the complaint of a
In a loan contract,
a term of the contract can impose a precondition (ie, a condition precedent) to
the borrower's discharge of the
debt as well as an obligation as to the manner
of discharging the debt. If the condition precedent to discharge is not met,
a claim for payment of the non-discharged debt is the demand for a right.
By contrast, a claim for failure to perform the contractual
duty as to the
manner of discharging the debt is a complaint of a wrong. The affirmation by a
creditor of a discharge of a debt precludes
the creditor demanding payment of
the debt but it does not waive the creditor's claim for the breach of contract.
a Note Facility Agreement, the appellant, Ms Shao, and her then husband,
Mr Peng, lent money to the first respondent, Crown
Global Capital Pty Ltd
("Crown Global"), with a guarantee by the second respondent, Crown Group
Holdings Pty Ltd ("Crown Group")
(collectively, "the Crown respondents").
A term of a Note Certificate, the terms of which formed part of the Note
Facility Agreement,
provided that money payable by Crown Global to Ms Shao
and Mr Peng could be repaid by deposit to an account nominated by both
Shao and Mr Peng ("the Account Nomination Term"). Contrary to the
Account Nomination Term, Crown Global repaid the money into an
account nominated
only by Mr Peng. Mr Peng transferred the money to his parents in
China. Ms Shao brought proceedings against Mr
Peng, bankrupting him
and obtaining recovery of only a small part of the funds Mr Peng had
received. Ms Shao then claimed damages
against Crown Global, including for
its breach of the Account Nomination Term.
various defences raised by the Crown respondents relevantly were, in substance,
that: (i) the Account Nomination Term operated
only as a condition
precedent to discharge of the debt; (ii) by prosecuting the action against
Mr Peng, and recovering in his bankruptcy,
Ms Shao had affirmed the
discharge of the debt and thereby ratified Mr Peng's nomination of his bank
account and, in effect, waived
any breach of the Account Nomination Term by
Crown Global; and (iii) it was an abuse of process for Ms Shao to
proceed against the
Crown respondents having not done so in the earlier
proceedings against Mr Peng.
trial judge in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Appeal of
the Supreme Court of New South Wales concluded,
in effect, that Ms Shao had
waived the breach of contract by Crown Global by her actions which affirmed the
discharge of the debt
owed by Crown Global. For the reasons below, that
conclusion was incorrect. None of the defences of the Crown respondents was made
out. The Note Facility Agreement relevantly contained two separate obligations:
(i) an obligation to repay the debt owed to Ms Shao
and Mr Peng
jointly; and (ii) the Account Nomination Term, concerning the manner in which
the debt was to be discharged, which was
owed to Ms Shao and Mr Peng
jointly and severally. It was open to Ms Shao to accept that the debt had
been discharged but to proceed
against the Crown respondents for the breach of
the Account Nomination Term by Crown Global. It was not an abuse of process for
Shao to seek first to recover from Mr Peng before proceeding
against the Crown respondents.
late February or early March 2015, Ms Shao and Mr Peng entered into an
agreement to lend $1 million to Crown Global. The agreement
was in writing, in
the form of a loan note described as a Note Facility Agreement. The terms are
described in detail later in these
reasons. Repayment was guaranteed by the
second respondent, Crown Group. The money that was lent was provided by
Ms Shao, who drew
two bank cheques on two of her own accounts.
16 March 2015, the Head of Private Clients at Crown Group, Ms Edwards,
spoke to Mr Peng by telephone and asked him for the details
of the account
into which he wished to have the interest on the loan deposited. Mr Peng
sent an email to Ms Edwards later that day
nominating a joint account in
the names of Ms Shao and Mr Peng. Crown Global deposited interest into
that account on 31 March 2015,
25 June 2015, 25 September 2015,
and 23 December 2015.
June and July 2015, Ms Shao engaged in correspondence with Ms Edwards
on the communication application WeChat and met with Ms
Edwards in person.
They discussed a property development with which Crown Group was associated and
deposits that had been paid by
Mr Peng in respect of that development.
After learning that those deposits had been refunded, Ms Shao asked
Ms Edwards for the details
of the account into which the refunds had been
paid and Ms Edwards replied that payment had been made into Mr Peng's
account. Ms
Edwards also told Ms Shao about two deposits that
Mr Peng had made, of which Ms Shao was not aware, in relation to
another development
by Crown Group. Ms Shao told Ms Edwards that she
had separated from Mr Peng and that she was having difficulties
communicating with,
and dealing with, Mr Peng.
24 August 2015, Ms Shao exchanged messages over WeChat with
Ms Edwards. The conversation began in relation to a development that
Group was going to launch. During the exchange, Ms Shao told
Ms Edwards that she and Mr Peng were still not talking and that
would divorce soon. Ms Shao also wrote that Mr Peng "transferred all my
money away, just want to make me angry". Although Ms
Shao did not explain
the background to that statement to Ms Edwards, her statement concerned
Mr Peng's withdrawal in around August
2015 of $600,000 from a joint
mortgage interest saver account with Mr Peng's joint interest held on trust
for Ms Shao. That unauthorised
withdrawal had prompted Ms Shao to
obtain freezing orders, following which Mr Peng repaid $460,000. The
remaining $140,000 was never
fully repaid.
17 February 2016, Ms Edwards sent an email to Mr Peng relevantly as
"I am writing as a kind reminder that your Loan Notes Facility dated
18 January 2015 will expire on 26 February 2016.
In accordance [with] Clause 4 of the Note Certificate, please let us know
if you would like to receive the repayment by way of cheque
or transfer. ...
If by cheque, please confirm the name/s of addressee.
If it is the latter, please provide the account details so that we can proceed
accordingly."
The reference to expiry on 26 February 2016 was an error because the
expiry date had been extended by agreement to 5 March 2016.
responded on the same day, 17 February 2016, thanking Ms Edwards for
the reminder and providing the details of a bank account,
which was in his name
only. All payments of interest had previously been paid into the joint account
which was in the names of both
Ms Shao and Mr Peng.
25 February 2016, Crown Global paid the capital and outstanding interest, which
amounted to $1,018,740, into the account in the
name of Mr Peng only.
3 March 2016, two days before the extended expiry date of the loan note
under the Note Facility Agreement, Ms Shao telephoned
Ms Edwards to
discuss the imminent expiry of the loan note. Ms Edwards told Ms Shao
that the loan note had already been redeemed
with payment made to Mr Peng.
In that conversation, or a later conversation, Ms Edwards suggested that
Ms Shao should speak with
Mr Peng about what had happened.
the same day, 3 March 2016, Ms Shao commenced proceedings in the Supreme
Court of New South Wales. Those proceedings were described
below as the "2016
proceedings". In the 2016 proceedings, Ms Shao sought, and obtained,
immediate interim freezing orders against
Mr Peng. But Mr Peng had
already transferred almost the entire amount to his parents in China.
defendants to Ms Shao's 2016 proceedings included Mr Peng, Crown
Global, and Crown Group. But Crown Global and Crown Group were
never served with
the proceedings. On 10 March 2016, Ms Shao sought leave to discontinue the
proceedings against Crown Global and
Crown Group, which was subsequently
granted. Ms Shao's amended claim in the 2016 proceedings was ultimately
against only Mr Peng,
seeking damages in the amount of the proceeds paid to
him by Crown Global, as well as the outstanding $140,000 from the $600,000
Mr Peng had misappropriated.
Ms Shao's claim against Mr Peng in the 2016 proceedings, she made the following
allegations, none of which is in dispute:
"39. On 17 February 2016, without notifying Shao, Peng directed Crown to pay the
proceeds of the expiring Facility into an ANZ bank
account in Peng's name only
("Direction").
40. Peng was not authorised by Shao to make the Direction.
41. On 25 February 2016, pursuant to the Direction, Crown paid the sum of
$1,018,740 into the ANZ bank account specified by Peng.
42. The sum of $1,018,740 paid by Crown to Peng was beneficially owned by Shao."
an affidavit filed in the 2016 proceedings, Ms Shao also asserted that her
assets included "[t]he sum of $1,000,000, being monies
I invested with [Crown
Global] on 6 March 2015 which were redeemed by [Mr Peng] without my
authority on or around 25 February 2016".
In written submissions later
filed in the 2016 proceedings, Ms Shao advanced the primary submission that
the funds received by Mr
Peng from Crown Global were held on trust for her.
August 2016, Mr Peng and Ms Shao were divorced. The
2016 proceedings were subsequently heard on 10 October 2016. Although
had filed a cross-claim making property and money claims under the
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth), Mr Peng's solicitor withdrew prior to the
hearing and Mr Peng neither pressed his cross-claim nor defended
Ms Shao's claim
against him. The primary judge in the 2016 proceedings
relevantly made a declaration that:
"the amount of AUD $1 million ... which formed part of the sum of AUD $1,018,740
paid by [Crown Global] on 25 February 2016 to [Mr
Peng's] account with
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ... was received and held by
[Mr Peng] on trust for the plaintiff."
Ms Shao subsequently obtained judgment in the 2016 proceedings for
$1,156,828.77.
23 January 2019, Ms Shao had Mr Peng served with a bankruptcy
notice. Mr Peng failed to comply with that notice and committed
bankruptcy. Ms Shao filed a creditor's
and, in the
bankruptcy proceedings, filed an affidavit of debt relying in part upon the
judgment debt of $1,156,828.77. Mr Peng was
made bankrupt on 12 December
2019. Ms Shao received two dividends, with a combined total of $17,416.55,
in Mr Peng's bankruptcy.
The Note Facility Agreement terms
and the Note Certificate terms
Note Facility Agreement into which Ms Shao and Mr Peng entered with
the Crown respondents in late February or early March 2015,
described the
parties to the agreement in the precursor words and terms of cll 1 and 2 as
follows: Crown Global as "Borrower", Crown
Group as "Guarantor", and
Mr Peng and Ms Shao as "Lender".
Note Facility Agreement provided in cl 4 for the Lender to make available
drawings under the facility upon receipt of a drawdown
notice. By cl 3, the
maximum principal amount of cash advances that would be made available, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties,
was $1 million. By cl 7(a), the
Borrower was required to issue notes to the Lender "upon settlement of each cash
advance made available
under this facility pursuant to a Drawdown Notice".
Annexure B to the Note Facility Agreement set out a proforma Note Certificate,
in substantially the form in which the Borrower was required by cl 7(a) to
provide it to the Lender upon the issue of the notes.
Note Certificate, which was signed by directors of Crown Global, was in the form
of Annexure B, the terms of which formed part
of the Note Facility Agreement.
The Note Certificate reflected a drawdown of the entire $1 million
facility. The Note Certificate
certified that the "Lender" (Mr Peng and
Ms Shao) "is the registered holder of 1,000,000 Notes of AUD 1.00 each
fully paid, maturing
on the Expiry Date subject to the Facility Agreement made
between the Borrower and the Lender dated 18 February 2015 and the Terms
and Conditions set out below".
terms and conditions of the Note Certificate included an interest rate of 12%
per annum on the $1,000,000 drawdown with an expiry
date of 5 March 2016,
altered by agreement from 26 February 2016. Clause 3(a) of the terms and
conditions of the Note Certificate
provided that:
"The Borrower may at any time by issuing a Redemption Notice to the Lender
redeem any Notes, and on the Expiry Date must redeem all
Notes, which have not
previously been redeemed for cash at their Face Value and repay the Face Value
and all interest accrued but
unpaid on the Note to the date of payment."
"Redemption Notice" was defined in the Note Facility Agreement as "a notice
substantially in the form of Annexure C duly completed
and signed by or on
behalf of the Borrower or in any other form (including verbal) as the Lender in
its absolute discretion accepts".
Annexure C was a proforma written Redemption
Notice addressed to Ms Shao and Mr Peng with provision for the
Borrower to insert the
number of notes to be redeemed, the date of redemption,
and the amount to be redeemed.
of the terms and conditions of the Note Certificate, which contained the Account
Nomination Term, provided as follows:
Payment of money
All money payable by the Borrower to the Lender under the Notes must be paid by
cheque drawn by the Borrower and either delivered
personally to the Lender on
the due date for payment or deposited into the Lender's bank account as notified
by the Lender to the
Borrower from time to time."
cl 16(b)(i) of the Note Facility Agreement, the agreement was governed by
the law of the State of New South Wales.
The proceedings in the
Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal
18 February 2022, Ms Shao brought proceedings against the Crown
respondents in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New
South Wales. Her
principal claim was for damages for breach of various terms of the Note Facility
Agreement by Crown Global. One
breach was said to be of cl 3 of the Note
Certificate by issuing a Redemption Notice only to Mr Peng rather than to
both Ms Shao
and Mr Peng. Another alleged breach was of the Account
Nomination Term in cl 4 of the Note Certificate by failing to make the
"into the Lender's bank account as notified by the Lender to the
Borrower from time to time".
claimed damages for either of these breaches as the loss of the entire amount of
$1,018,740 that was paid to Mr Peng, together
with the cost of bringing
proceedings against Mr Peng, less the $17,416.55 in dividends received in
Mr Peng's bankruptcy. Ms Shao's
claim for the entire amount of
$1,018,740, arising from the payment to Mr Peng of the principal and
interest repayable for the joint
loan, was based upon her claim, which was
common ground throughout these proceedings, that the rights that she and
Mr Peng had against
the Crown respondents under the Note Facility Agreement
were held on trust by them for Ms Shao alone, who had provided the
As the case was
presented to the trial judge, the issues in relation to liability were: (i)
whether Crown Global had discharged its
obligations under the Note Facility
Agreement by its payment of $1,018,740 in accordance with Mr Peng's
instructions; and (ii) whether
by pursuing her proceedings against Mr Peng,
Ms Shao had ratified Mr Peng's conduct and in doing so had made an
election from which
she could not resile.
trial judge (Ball J) dismissed Ms Shao's claim. As to the
interpretation of cl 3 of the Note Certificate, the trial judge held
although "Lender" was defined as both Ms Shao and Mr Peng, it was open
to Crown Global, who determined the form of the Redemption
Notice, to provide
that notice only to Mr Peng and not to Ms Shao. Service of the
Redemption Notice upon one joint lender would be
service upon them
trial judge took a different approach to the interpretation of the Account
Nomination Term in cl 4 of the Note Certificate. The
trial judge held that
cl 4 permitted the redemption payment to be made by cheque or by bank
transfer but that, if payment were to
be made by bank transfer, payment to "the
Lender's bank account as notified by the Lender" was a requirement for Crown
obtain "good discharge" of its

judge rejected the submission of the Crown respondents that Mr Peng had
acted with Ms Shao's actual or ostensible authority
on 17 February
2016 when he directed Crown Global to make the payment into the account in his
sole name. The trial judge found that:
(i) from 23 June 2015, all the
dealings between Ms Shao and Crown Global were conducted by Ms Shao
personally; (ii) by early July
2015, Crown Global knew that Ms Shao
and Mr Peng had separated and that they rarely communicated with each
other; and (iii) by at
least 24 August 2015, Crown Global knew that Ms
Shao and Mr Peng would soon be
Nevertheless,
the trial judge held that Crown Global had not breached the Account Nomination
Term in cl 4 of the Note Certificate
by making the redemption payment to an
account provided only by Mr Peng. His Honour held that there were only two
possibilities that
arose from the payment by Crown Global to Mr Peng. The
first possibility was that Ms Shao could treat the act of Mr Peng in
his personal account for the payment as unauthorised, in which case
the debt would not have been discharged and there would be no
cl 4 by Crown Global. Ms Shao could sue Crown Global for the debt,
joining Mr Peng as a defendant if he were not prepared
to be joined as a
plaintiff. The second possibility was that Ms Shao could ratify
Mr Peng's act and sue him for the proceeds of the
payment. The trial judge
held that Ms Shao had chosen the latter course and was bound by
It was therefore
unnecessary for the trial judge to consider an alternative claim by the Crown
respondents that it was an abuse of
process for Ms Shao to bring the claim
against the Crown respondents on the basis that such a claim should have been
brought in the
2016 proceedings.
trial judge found that if Ms Shao had been entitled to damages from Crown
Global then those damages would have included: (i)
$1,018,740 representing
the amount that was paid to Mr Peng; plus (ii) $113,567.04 representing the
legal costs of mitigation in
pursuing the claim against Mr Peng through the
2016 proceedings, which was a reduced amount due to part of the legal
proceedings
being concerned with Mr Peng's family law claims; less
(iii) the amounts recovered in mitigation as dividends from Mr Peng's
(which were later agreed by the parties to be
$17,416.55).
The Court of Appeal decision
appealed to the Court of Appeal. One of her grounds of appeal was that the trial
judge erred in concluding that Crown Global
had not breached cl 3(a) of the
Note Certificate. Another alleged that the trial judge erred in concluding that
Crown Global had
not breached cl 4 of the Note Certificate.
the Court of Appeal, Adamson JA (with whom Leeming and Payne JJA
agreed) held that there had been no breach of cl 3(a) of the
Certificate. The purpose of the Redemption Notice was not protective of either
or both of the joint lenders. Rather, the purpose
was merely to communicate
Crown Global's irrevocable exercise of its unilateral right to repay early.
Hence, it was held that "Lender"
in cl 3 meant either Ms Shao or
Mr Peng (or both of them), and the Redemption Notice issued by Crown Global
to the assertion of a breach of cl 4 of the Note Certificate, Adamson JA
held that the purpose of cl 4 was protective of each
of the joint lenders
from the other nominating an account to which the other lender had sole access.
The protective purpose required
"Lender" in cl 4 to be interpreted to mean
both Ms Shao and Mr Peng, not either of
Nevertheless,
Adamson JA held that Ms Shao had no claim for breach of cl 4 of
the Note Certificate because, by prosecuting the 2016
proceedings against
Mr Peng, she had taken a position that was "entirely inconsistent" with
maintaining the current proceedings against
the Crown respondents, since she had
"ratified the deficiencies in Mr Peng's authority to nominate the account"
and had accepted
that the debt had been
discharged.
distinguished the line of authority, including
Ardern v Bank of New South
which had held
that a creditor could ratify the acceptance of a payment without being precluded
from suing the debtor for breaches
of other obligations of the
Court of Appeal did not need to decide the issues raised by the Crown
respondents in their notice of contention, including the
Crown respondents'
contention that the proceedings were an abuse of process. The Court of Appeal
also did not address two grounds
of appeal concerning the quantification of
damages, although Adamson JA noted the proper concession of the Crown
respondents that
the legal costs recoverable should have been calculated as
$131,793.95. There was no further dispute in this Court that the correct
quantification of any damages, consistent with that concession, is
$1,133,117.40.
The issues in this Court
this Court there was no longer any dispute about the interpretation of
cl 3(a) of the Note Certificate or the conclusion that
Crown Global had
validly issued the Redemption Notice. Ms Shao's appeal focused only upon
the alleged breach by Crown Global of cl
4 of the Note Certificate.
Ms Shao raised two grounds of appeal: first, that the Court of Appeal erred
in holding that she was not
entitled to claim damages from the Crown respondents
in breach of contract, in circumstances where she had previously sued
to recover those monies but had made only a partial recovery; and
secondly, that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that her proceedings
Mr Peng necessarily involved a ratification of the notice given by
Mr Peng to Crown Global nominating his bank account for
repayment of the
Crown respondents submitted that the Court of Appeal had correctly concluded
that there was no breach of cl 4 of the Note Certificate
independent reasons. First, it was submitted that cl 4 did not create any
obligation upon Crown Global to repay the loan
only into an account nominated by
both Ms Shao and Mr Peng. Secondly, it was submitted that even if
cl 4 created such an obligation,
Ms Shao had ratified: (i) the act of
Mr Peng in nominating his account for repayment by Crown Global; and (ii)
acceptance of the
non-conforming tender. And, by a notice of contention, the
Crown respondents raised a third issue. The Crown respondents submitted
even if Crown Global had breached cl 4, Ms Shao's claim was an abuse
of process because Ms Shao should have pursued the claim
against the Crown
respondents as part of the 2016 proceedings. None of these submissions should be
The first issue: Proper construction of cl 4 of the
Note Certificate – the Account Nomination Term
effect of the Crown respondents' submissions was that the Account Nomination
Term only created a condition precedent for the
discharge of the debt owed by
Crown Global, and not an additional obligation, the non-compliance with which
would be a breach of
contract by Crown Global, and no implication of a separate
obligation should be recognised. There are two different matters raised
authorities in this area. The first is whether a term of an agreement between a
borrower and lenders, such as cl 4 of the
Note Certificate, can create both
a condition precedent to discharge of a debt and a separate obligation on the
borrower as to the
manner of the discharge of the debt. The second is whether
any such separate obligation is owed to lenders jointly or to lenders
and severally.
Clause 4 of the Note Certificate created both a
condition precedent and an obligation
submissions by the Crown respondents fail to recognise that "a term of a
contract may have a 'double operation' and create both
a duty and a
condition".
Westacott v Hahn
Scrutton LJ said:
"it is impossible since
dispute that one term of a contract may be in its performance essential, or a
condition precedent, to obligation or liability on
another term of the contract,
though if it is waived the only remedy may be an action for the breach. In this
a condition precedent is a limitation or qualification of another
term of a contract, while it may also be itself a term of a contract
breach gives a cause of action."
example of this "double operation" is the decision of the Supreme Court of
Victoria in
case, Mr Ardern and Mr Brookes opened a joint business account with
the defendant bank. Each of them told the manager of
the bank that all cheques
drawn on the account were to be signed by both of them. The manager agreed.
Martin J held that a term of
the "agreement ... was that ... no cheque
would be honoured unless signed by both of [the
partners]".
acted contrary to that term when it paid out from the account on 13 cheques
to Mr Brookes as payee, where Mr Brookes had
forged the signature of
Mr Ardern. Martin J recognised that the term was both a duty and a
condition precedent, holding that Mr Ardern
was entitled to elect between
damages for the breach of contract by the bank or a declaration that the amounts
of the forged cheques
had been wrongfully debited by the
Catlin v Cyprus Finance Corporation (London)
case, Mr and Mrs Catlin deposited money with a finance company. The
finance company "agreed to honour instructions signed
by both account holders".
Bingham J held that this agreement "no doubt imported a negative duty not
to honour instructions not signed
by both account holders", a duty which was
owed severally.
negative duty was not an implied term; it was an "express mandate" which was
breached by the transfer of funds from the account

In that case, an agreement between Aon Ltd and two creditors contained an
express term that payments would be made "into a designated
Bank Account to be
Aon Ltd made the
payment into the account of only one of the creditors without any prior notice
and without the consent of the other
creditor. Mance LJ (with whom
Ward LJ and Jackson J agreed) held that the unpaid creditor had a
claim for damages because the provision
existed "for the protection of each of
[the creditors]" and included a "negative duty" to each creditor "not to honour
instructions
and not make payments not involving a jointly agreed and designated
bank account".
same is true of cl 4 of the Note Certificate. Clause 4, which expressly provided
that if the money were not paid by cheque, the
money "must be ... deposited into
the Lender's bank account as notified by the Lender to the Borrower from time to
time", is properly
interpreted as a requirement that the money must be deposited
into the bank account as notified by both Ms Shao and
Mr Peng. That is the content of the express term; no term is
That requirement
is both a condition precedent to discharge of the debt and also an obligation
not to deposit the money into a bank
account other than as notified by
Ms Shao and Mr Peng. The latter obligation is a "negative duty" of the
kind described above, namely
a duty not to deposit the repayment into an account
not nominated by both Ms Shao and Mr Peng.
obligation in cl 4 of the Note Certificate was owed jointly and
the term of a contract between a borrower and two or more lenders, properly
interpreted, imposes both a condition precedent
and a separate obligation as to
the manner of repayment, there is a further question of whether the obligation
is owed to the lenders
jointly, or jointly and severally. This issue assumes
importance because an obligation that is owed jointly generally requires the
joinder of all parties who are entitled to the performance of the obligation.
Although the Crown respondents did not argue that Ms
Shao's claim should
fail due to the absence of Mr Peng as a party, they nevertheless relied
upon authorities and commentary which
treated the obligation as one that was
owed jointly.
difficulties in relation to this issue arose from the decision of the Queen's
Bench Division in
Brewer v Westminster Bank
aspects of which
were relied upon by the Crown respondents. In
, two executors
opened a joint account with a bank, providing a mandate for the bank to pay on
any cheque signed by both executors.
Over a period of years, one executor forged
the signature of the other and withdrew money for his own purposes. The other
brought an action for a declaration that the bank had wrongfully
debited the joint account with the amount of the cheques.
the innocent executor in
could have brought an action for breach

the benefit of each partner, to prevent any dishonest

was also followed by Bingham J in
said that although the relevant duty could have been owed jointly, "it must (to
make sense) have been owed to the account holders
severally, because the only
purpose of requiring two signatures was to obviate the possibility of
independent action by one account

Young CJ in Eq observed that the rejection by Martin J in
of the difficult decision in
has been repeated at
least twice in England
and "approved by the writers of most of the leading textbooks".
Crown respondents submitted that the recognition of separate, several promises
in favour of multiple lenders could give rise
to difficulties of inconsistent
elections. No case was identified where this practical concern had arisen. Save
to emphasise that
the grant of a declaration is a discretionary remedy, such an
issue is best left to be dealt with in a case where the facts raise
short, the obligation in cl 4 was owed jointly and severally to Ms Shao and
Mr Peng. As a result, Ms Shao was entitled to sue
Crown Global for
breach of that obligation and was not required to join Mr Peng to the
proceedings against the Crown respondents.
The second issue:
Could Ms Shao accept discharge without waiving Crown Global's
next submission made by the Crown respondents was that by prosecuting the 2016
proceedings, bankrupting Mr Peng, and claiming
dividends in his bankruptcy
referable to the payment by Crown Global, Ms Shao had ratified: (i)
Mr Peng's act of providing the details
of his bank account; and (ii)
acceptance of the non-conforming tender. This submission had several steps.
without any conduct by Ms Shao, Crown Global's payment to Mr Peng
would not have discharged the debt. At common law, the payment
to one joint
creditor will discharge a debt owed to all joint
But, contrary
to Ms Shao's submissions in the courts below, that common law position can
be altered by agreement.
In this case, it was altered by the condition precedent in cl 4 of the Note
Certificate. The effect of cl 4 of the Note Certificate
was to prevent
discharge of the debt unless the payment complied with a direction given by both
Ms Shao and Mr Peng.
as was properly accepted by Ms Shao in this Court, Ms Shao had
affirmed that the debt owed by Crown Global to her and Mr
Peng had been
discharged. Ms Shao affirmed the discharge of Crown Global's debt by
prosecuting the 2016 proceedings, bankrupting
Mr Peng, and claiming dividends in
his bankruptcy referable to the payment made by Crown Global. Those actions were
dependent upon
Ms Shao asserting an entitlement to the proceeds, which she
ultimately vindicated in part. That entitlement could only have arisen
debt had been discharged. Ms Shao's conduct thus involved an acceptance
that the performance by Crown Global in paying Mr
Peng had discharged the
and controversially, the Crown respondents submitted that "the debt could only
have been discharged if the condition in
clause 4 was complied with". The
Crown respondents submitted, in effect, that Ms Shao could not accept Crown
Global's performance,
which was subject to a condition precedent, without
waiving Crown Global's breach of duty in the manner of that performance. This
step, which was expressed in the language of "ratification", should be rejected.
a matter of principle, the simplest answer to this submission is that, as
Scrutton LJ said in the passage quoted above from
Westacott v
a party can
accept performance or discharge of an obligation, despite the non-satisfaction
of a condition precedent to that performance
or discharge, without waiving the
counterparty's liability for breach.
rule is well known in contracts for the sale of goods. If a seller promises to
deliver goods at a certain time or in a certain
manner, the buyer can accept the
goods as discharging the obligation to provide the goods but can claim for
breach of contract if
the goods are not provided at the time or in the manner
promised. For instance, in
Peter Cremer v Brinkers' Groudstoffen
the sellers
breached a condition precedent to payment in their contracts by failing to ship
the promised goods to Rotterdam. The
buyers nevertheless accepted delivery of
the goods in Hamburg but successfully sued for breach of contract for
transhipment costs
to Rotterdam. The rule is equally applicable to contracts
concerning the lending of money. If a borrower repays money late or in
some other term of the contract, the lender can accept the late or defective
payment, discharging the debt, and bring an
action against the borrower for
consequential loss, such as the loss of use of the money, arising from the
breach of contract in
the timing or manner of
preceding analysis shows that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that
Ms Shao was limited to choosing between: (i) suing the
Crown respondents
for recovery of the proceeds of the Note Facility Agreement, on the ground that
Crown Global's payment to Mr Peng
did not validly discharge the debt; and
(ii) accepting that the payment discharged the debt and suing Mr Peng.
Ms Shao had a third
option, which she pursued: accepting that the debt was
discharged, but not discharged in conformity with the Account Nomination Term
to the manner of repayment, which enabled her to sue for damages arising from
that defective performance. In such circumstances,
Ms Shao did not ratify
Crown Global's breach of cl 4.
may be that the language of ratification in this case confuses the analysis of
the two separate questions of whether performance
has been accepted and whether
a breach of duty in the performance has been waived. Ratification, which is "the
act of giving sanction
and validity to something done by
might be a way
to establish that performance has been accepted or that a breach of duty has
been waived. But the act to be ratified
"must have been done for and in the name
of the supposed
principal".
To the extent
that the Crown respondents submitted that Ms Shao had ratified
Mr Peng's nomination of the account into which the repayment
made, it might be doubted whether Mr Peng's emailed reply to Ms Edwards on
17 February 2016 was conduct by which Mr Peng
professed to be acting
also on behalf of
any event, Ms Shao's actions in bringing proceedings against Mr Peng,
bankrupting him, and obtaining dividends in his bankruptcy
referable to the
payment by Crown Global could only amount to an implied ratification of acts of
Mr Peng to the extent that the actions
of Ms Shao were unequivocal
affirmations of Mr Peng's conduct. Ms Shao's actions necessarily
affirmed the acceptance by Mr Peng of
payment from Crown Global and the
discharge of Crown Global's debt. But her actions did not ratify the direction
that Mr Peng gave
to Ms Edwards on 17 February 2016. Even if Mr Peng's
direction had purportedly also been given on behalf of Ms Shao, none of
subsequent conduct ratified such action on her behalf. Indeed,
Ms Shao's pleading in the 2016 proceedings had described Mr Peng's
direction as unauthorised.
analogy can be drawn with the decision in
Harrisons & Crossfield Ltd v
London and North-Western Railway
In that case, an
employee of the defendant railway company, wearing the uniform of the company
and with a horse and cart of the company,
stole a consignment of tea which the
plaintiff tea merchants intended to be delivered to the railway company for
carriage. The railway
company prosecuted the employee for theft and obtained
possession of the tea. The tea merchants brought an action against the railway
company for breach of its duty as a common carrier, alleging that by prosecuting
the employee for theft and obtaining title to the
tea the railway company had
ratified the act of its former employee, being the employee's act of purporting
to accept the tea on
behalf of the railway company. Rowlatt J dismissed the
claim, holding that implied ratification is only "implied from or involved
acts when you cannot logically analyse the act without imputing ... approval to
the [principal]".
that the railway company had ratified by its prosecution was "a bare
Crown respondents relied upon cases in which it was held that a principal cannot
affirm part of an agreement entered into by
an agent and disaffirm the
proposition can be accepted. As Chitty J explained in one case relied upon
by the Crown respondents, this proposition means
that a principal who receives
goods purportedly purchased by an agent will adopt the transaction unless the
principal returns the
goods or offers to return them within a reasonable
But, by such
adoption, the principal does not waive any breach of contract by the seller. So
too, the affirmation by Ms Shao of Mr
Peng's receipt of money from
Crown Global in discharge of the debt was not a waiver of any breach of contract
by Crown Global in
its performance of the duty under cl 4 of the Note
Certificate concerning the manner in which the debt was
discharged.
The third issue: Was it an abuse of process for
Ms Shao to proceed against the Crown respondents for breach of
third issue was raised by the Crown respondents in a notice of contention.
Neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal was
required to address this
issue. The submission was short and succinct. The Crown respondents submitted
that Ms Shao ought to have
brought her claim against them in the
2016 proceedings and that it was an abuse of process for her to bring these
proceedings almost
six years later.
doctrine of abuse of process is capable of wide application, encompassing almost
any aspect of the procedures of a court, and
is unconfined by any closed
categories.
terms, an abuse of a court's process "is capable of application in any
circumstances in which the use of a court's procedures
would be unjustifiably
oppressive to a party or would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute".
Some of the
limits to that application are well established. One limit is that it is "wrong
to hold that because a matter could have
been raised in earlier proceedings it
should have been".
such a holding is, in effect, what is sought by the Crown respondents.
can be accepted that Ms Shao could have maintained the
2016 proceedings against the Crown respondents. Both respondents were named
in her writ, although it was never served on them and was ultimately
discontinued against them. There were good reasons for that
particular, the proceedings against the Crown respondents were for remedies
which were cumulative, not alternative, to
those sought against Mr Peng; no
choice was required between
claim for damages against the Crown respondents would have been reduced by the
rules of mitigation of loss, potentially
to nothing resulting in wasted
litigation against the Crown respondents, to the extent to which she recovered
from Mr Peng.
were other good reasons for the course taken by Ms Shao in excluding the
Crown respondents from the 2016 proceedings. A number
of the issues raised in
the 2016 proceedings against Mr Peng were either of no concern to the Crown
respondents or matters upon which
the Crown respondents could say very little:
the family law issues raised by Mr Peng; the separate allegations of
Mr Peng's misappropriation
of $140,000; and the issues of actual or
ostensible authority of Mr Peng to give the 17 February 2016 direction
to Ms Edwards. The
addition to the 2016 proceedings of the difficult legal
questions that have been finally resolved by this Court would have been
inefficient
and burdensome in circumstances in which the 2016 proceedings were
likely to be expedited because Ms Shao had sought, and obtained,
freezing order against Mr Peng and had likely given an undertaking as to damages
in support.
Crown respondents sought to draw an analogy with the decision of this Court in
UBS AG v Tyne
conclusion of the majority of this Court in
that the claim was an
abuse of process rested upon the conclusion that there was, or at least it was
open to the primary judge to

"unjustifiable
oppression" to the defendant in the bringing of a proceeding in the Federal
Court of Australia involving essentially
the same claim, and arising from
essentially the same facts, as a claim that had previously been brought, and
discontinued, by the
same party in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and
permanently stayed when another party had continued to prosecute those
proceedings.
The unjustifiable oppression was said to arise from the significant
delay, increased costs, and the requirement to deal again with
claims that
should have been resolved in the Supreme Court of New South
circumstances of these proceedings are a long way from those considered by this
. The decision in
does have in common with
this case the possibility that the impugned claim could have been brought in an
earlier proceeding. But
that is where the similarity ends. None of the good
reasons for the course taken by Ms Shao were present in
Ms Shao's proceedings were not an abuse of
