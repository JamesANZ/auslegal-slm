Introduction
are concerned with the relationship between Dr Richard Wood and one of his
patients, a retired World War 2 RAAF pilot, now deceased,
a proud man generous
to all those he knew. He gave Dr Wood gifts of wine for special occasions, as
thanks for particular assistance,
and at other times, and he gave him a $200
meal voucher (to share with his wife). On one occasion he offered him some
money, which
Dr Wood says he refused.
daughter and granddaughter believed Dr Wood had failed to observe appropriate
professional boundaries. As his appointed enduring
guardian, the granddaughter
also thought that Dr Wood did not keep her properly informed of her
grandfather’s medical management,
that Dr Wood undertook a further
assessment of her grandfather’s cognitive abilities when there
was no basis to do
so, and that he later incorrectly diagnosed her grandfather
as cognitively competent. She raised her concerns with the Health Care
Complaints Commission, and the Commission brought this Complaint of
unsatisfactory professional conduct.
but not all of the facts of the particulars of the Complaint were admitted
Dr Wood. Our task is to decide whether Dr Wood’s conduct, undisputed or
as found by us, was significantly below the reasonable
standard expected or was
otherwise improper or unethical.
considering the evidence and the meaning of unsatisfactory professional conduct
we have concluded that the Complaint has not
been proved, and accordingly we
make no finding of unsatisfactory professional conduct by Dr Wood.
on-publication direction
26 June 2017 the chairperson of this Professional Standards Committee made a
direction that there be no publication of any information
that would identify Dr
Wood’s patient. The direction was made on behalf of the family, and
because the particular identity
of the patient is not relevant to the
determination of the Complaint. That direction continues. It was apparent from
the evidence
that Dr Wood’s patient took pride in his war service. We
describe him as the Ex-serviceman, rather than use the impersonal
nomenclature
of ‘the Patient’.
he Complaint
Complaint of unsatisfactory professional conduct (as amended,
has four components:
that Dr Wood failed to observe appropriate professional boundaries in
accepting gifts of bottles of wine on a number of occasions
and on a regular
basis, receiving a gift voucher for a meal worth $200, and on or about 25 July
2014 accepting $1,000 in cash;
Dr Wood failed between 12 September and 9 December 2013 to appropriately engage
with the Ex-serviceman’s enduring guardian
concerning his medical
management by not informing her of the Ex-serviceman’s request for a
further assessment of his cognitive
abilities after an earlier assessment by a
psychiatrist (Dr Subau), and that Dr Wood arranged for that further assessment
by a geriatric
specialist practitioner (Dr Delohery);
in October 2013 Dr Wood arranged that further assessment without appropriate
medical or therapeutic purpose, in that there was no
need for a further
assessment so soon after the previous assessment, and that the psychiatrist was
not contacted to discuss the matter;
On 17 December 2013 Dr Wood failed to make an appropriate diagnosis of the
Ex-serviceman as being cognitively competent, including
for the purpose of
driving, in concluding the Ex-serviceman had been suffering from temporary
delirium and not dementia at the time
of the earlier assessment by the
psychiatrist.
raised as four distinct matters, the underlying thread of how Dr Wood managed
the doctor-patient relationship is what connects
Commission submitted that the first component of the Complaint amounted to
unsatisfactory professional conduct as defined by section
139B(1)(l) of the
Health Practitioner Regulation National Law
(National Law), being
‘other improper or unethical conduct’, and that the other components
amounted to unsatisfactory
professional conduct under section 139B(1)(a) of the
National Law, in that the conduct fell significantly below the standard
Wood denied any unsatisfactory professional conduct though he acknowledged
infrequent bottles of wine from the patient on occasions
such as Christmas and
birthday, and sometimes more frequently. He denied that he accepted bottles
of wine on a regular basis. He acknowledged receipt
of the $200 voucher but
said it was to him and his wife, also a general practitioner, for both of their
professional assistance to
the patient and his wife. Although he agreed the
Ex-serviceman once offered him money, he denied having accepted it. A
Gold Card covered all medical expenses, and the patient was
never charged for any attendance.
respect to the second aspect of the Complaint Dr Wood admitted that he had not
spoken to the granddaughter, saying he had no
obligation to do so as in his
assessment the patient had full capacity and was capable of managing his own
respect to the third aspect of the Complaint Dr Wood said there was a proper
basis to obtain a report from a specialist other
than the one previously
received from another specialist. Dr Wood’s response in this regard
overlaps with his response to
the fourth aspect of the Complaint in that he says
he had a proper basis for concluding that the first assessment by a specialist
was flawed and that a review was appropriate and reasonable, given the request
by the Ex-serviceman.
undertook our inquiry on 29 and 30 August 2017, and 15 December 2017. During
the course of the hearing the Commission amended
the Complaint by the deletion
of some parts of the original Complaint and the provision of more specific
particulars. In doing so
the Commission simplified the course of the
proceedings and our task.
Emma Bailey, solicitor, represented the Commission, and Mr Tim Saunders
instructed by Ms Nevena Brown of Miridian Lawyers, represented
Dr Wood. We thank
them for their efficiency and professionalism in assisting us to deal only with
those matters in contention.
undertaking our inquiry we applied the civil standard and make our findings on
the balance of probability. The factual issues
for our consideration were:
was the frequency and volume of gifts of wine accepted by Dr Wood over the
were the circumstances of the receipt of the gift of the $200 voucher for a
Dr Wood accept a gift of $1,000 from the patient?
Dr Wood improperly fail to engage with the Ex-serviceman’s granddaughter
(his appointed enduring guardian) concerning his
medical management in making a
referral to Dr Delohery for assessment of the patient’s capacity given he
had recently received
a report from Dr Subau on that topic?
there a medical basis in seeking the opinion from Dr Delohery?
Dr Wood have a basis for concluding in December 2013 that the Ex- serviceman was
cognitively competent, including for the purpose
of driving a motor vehicle, in
that he incorrectly concluded in October 2013 that the Ex- serviceman was
suffering a temporary delirium
and not dementia?
he evidence
Wood practised as a general practitioner in partnership with his wife, and she
was the general practitioner for the Ex-serviceman’s
Ex-serviceman was a patient of Dr Wood for a decade or so and ceased to see Dr
Wood from about July 2014. The patient died
having no connection with Dr Wood or our inquiry.
Commission provided two folders of material (
) containing
documents relating to the Complaint, a long statement from the granddaughter
with various annexures, statements from
the Ex-serviceman’s family and
friends and from
Dr Wood’s staff, information from other practitioners consulted by the
Ex-serviceman, papers relating to the granddaughter’s
guardianship and power of attorney, financial statements, a report from Dr Emery
Kertesz as an expert, materials from
Dr Wood in response to the Commission’s investigation and the relevant
medical records. Importantly, the Commission provided

August 2017 attaching documents, and some text
messages between her and the
Ex-serviceman’s daughter, her mother. Included were colour copies of the
Ex-serviceman’s
handwritten diaries through to 2013 and 2014, the most
significant period of our inquiry (
Kertesz was provided with further information by letter of 11 August 2017

Bailey helpfully provided a chronology of essential dates, agreed by Mr Saunders
). During the course of the hearing the referral documents
from Dr Wood to Dr Delohery became available and were provided to us (

now deal with the factual matters in dispute and the allegation of
unsatisfactory professional conduct. In determining the factual
matters we have
applied the civil standard and being careful in reaching conclusions.
he gifts of wine
Wood acknowledges receiving gifts of wine. It was uncontroversial that, in
general, patients give gifts to their doctors, often
bottles of wine or spirits.
On the evidence before us medical practitioners invariably accept these gifts.
It was not argued that
accepting a gift is necessarily unsatisfactory
professional conduct. The Complaint is that in the circumstances Dr Wood
too much and too often.
there was a great deal of evidence on the point, ultimately there is little
difference between what Dr Wood says was the
frequency and amount of wine given
to him, and the evidence provided by the Commission. The daughter and
granddaughter believed
it was a lot of wine on many occasions. However their
evidence of what they had seen pass between the Ex-serviceman and Dr Wood
more limited – and not markedly different from Dr Wood’s
description. It is clear he was giving gifts of wine to
many people, to those
who provided services and to his friends. The evidence is he gave gifts of wine
to at least four of his other
medical practitioners and to his physiotherapist.
The number and spread of these gifts would explain the belief of the daughter
granddaughter that there were frequent gifts. There is evidence of a gift
being made during a home visit. Dr Wood has no recollection
of taking the wine
away, but does not deny the possibility. Perhaps the Ex-serviceman said the
wine was for him, and delivered it
later; we are unable to determine. However,
we conclude that the frequency and amount of the gifts is of the order as Dr
admitted. Even if it were somewhat more our ultimate conclusion would
be the same.
Wood did not say that he ever refused the gifts of wine - he accepted them all.
One of the receptionists working two days a week
stated that there were gifts at
Christmas time and at the time of Dr Wood’s birthday. She remembers
Christmas as being an
event when gifts were given and recalls the gifts of wine
for Dr Wood’s birthday because hers is the same date. But she also
concedes that there may have been gifts of wine on other occasions – she
is not confident either way.
other receptionist stated that she observed the patient coming to the practice
with gifts of wine for Dr Wood at Christmas and
for occasions like a birthday.
A friend said he was aware that the Ex-serviceman was giving gifts of wine to Dr
Wood and on one
occasion he accompanied him to the surgery when a gift was
delivered. The patient’s daughter said that on those occasions
was staying with her parents she often saw him preparing wine to give as a gift
and that on at least two occasions she attended
when the delivery was made. The
Ex-serviceman made notes of some of his gifts, but it is not clear if the notes
are confirmation
of an actual gift or a statement of intention.
the years the frequency was increasing from only at Christmas and mid-year
birthday time to a few more times each year. The Ex-serviceman
saw Dr Wood about
fortnightly. There is no evidence that he gave gifts on every visit or in a
predictable pattern of giving, and
we conclude it was more likely about every
two or three months.
The gifts were for Dr Wood and also for his wife, Dr Suzanne Wood, who was
the general practitioner for the Ex-serviceman’s
wife. The evidence before
us was that the bottles of wine were comparatively inexpensive. The
Ex-serviceman knew
Dr Wood liked red wine and his wife white wine, and gave bottles of both on
most occasions.
all of this evidence together and on the basis that those who gave evidence were
doing their best to recall things as well
as they could we have concluded that
gifts of wine for Dr Wood, usually of two bottles but sometimes more, were
accepted by Dr Wood
at Christmas time, at around his birthday and on other
occasions, perhaps three or four times in total a year. The frequency and
may have been somewhat more, but not significantly so.
he circumstances of
the gift voucher
between 17 May 2013 and 31 July 2013 the Ex-serviceman took or delivered to the
surgery a $200 gift voucher for Dr Wood and
his wife to enjoy a meal at a local
restaurant. In a covering note the Ex-serviceman refers to how his wife’s
health has been
progressing and that he had recently received an unconditional
driver’s licence, of which he was very proud. Dr Wood admits
he received
the gift, and says he believed the gift was given mainly in recognition of Dr
Suzanne Wood’s efforts on behalf
of the Ex-serviceman’s wife.
Although the Ex-serviceman referred to his unrestricted drivers licence there is
no allegation,
nor any evidence, that Dr Wood did anything other than what was
appropriate in relation to the licence renewal.
id Dr Wood accept a
gift of $1,000?
this part of the Complaint came to us the only issue was whether Dr Wood had
accepted a gift of $1,000. There was evidence, which
we accept, that the Ex-
serviceman prepared a gift by placing $1,000 in a standard business size
envelope addressed to Dr Wood a
few days before visiting Dr Wood on 25 July
daughter was aware that her father had prepared the gift and she wanted to find
out if Dr Wood would take the money. She contacted
her daughter and they
decided she should take a photograph of the money in the envelope, and she did
so. She went with her father
to Dr Wood’s surgery. When her father was
consulting Dr Wood she waited outside in the reception area. She gave evidence
when her father left her to see Dr Wood the envelope was in one of his
buttoned shirt pockets. She said that when he came out of
the room the pocket
was unbuttoned and the envelope was
not there. When she asked him if Dr Wood had taken the money he said,
“Yes, and he thanked me profusely!” She said she
tried to check his
other pockets but could not find the envelope. Although she was concerned about
Dr Wood accepting a gift of money
she did not raise the matter at that time or
later. She did, however, make a note in her father’s diary.
answering questions the daughter was not always clear in her evidence and had
some trouble putting events in order, even when
speaking about aspects of her
own statements and the various text messages she had sent to her daughter.
Although we accept she was
doing her best to assist, we consider that she likely
approached the events of 25 July 2014 in the belief that the envelope would
handed over, and as a consequence she viewed what happened at the time and has
since recalled in that light.
Wood recalled an occasion when the Ex-serviceman went to hand him an envelope,
saying, “This is for you”. Dr Wood
thought the envelope looked like
it contained a ‘wad’ of money. Dr Wood says he refused to accept
the envelope and said,
“There’s no need for that”. He
described the envelope as being of the same kind as appeared in the photograph
taken by the daughter. He did not make a note of what happened, as he said
didn’t think much about the incident at the time.
conclude that the circumstances described by the daughter and Dr Wood are the
one and the same event.
month later Dr Wood was on leave, and the Ex-serviceman consulted the locum, Dr
Evans (now deceased). The Ex-serviceman offered
an envelope of money to
Dr Evans, which he refused. According to a statement from Dr Evans the
daughter had said, “Dr Wood always takes it”.
However, the daughter
said it was her father who had made the comment. If the Ex-serviceman had made
the statement, we would not
necessarily conclude the statement as confirmation
that Dr Wood had accepted the gift.
was evidence that the Ex-serviceman had made his way in life by being generous,
and that he prided himself on being able to
get the best service by giving
gifts. From what we learned from the evidence he was a man intent on being in
charge of his life,
even at his late age. He did not want his daughter, or
granddaughter, or even his wife, telling him how he should deal with his
or his affairs.
refusal by Dr Wood to accept the gift, especially after having accepted the
gifts of wine, may have been a blow to his view of himself.
The Ex-serviceman
may have wanted to keep from his daughter that Dr Wood had not accepted the
money. So when asked by his daughter
accepted the money. Dr Wood did not see what the Ex-serviceman did with the
envelope but it did
not go back into the button pocket. Whilst the daughter made
an effort to search his pockets that she could not locate the envelope
mean Dr Wood received it. On the available evidence the Ex-serviceman was not
the type to allow his daughter to undertake
a thorough search of his
this all into account we conclude that although the envelope of money was
offered, it was refused by Dr Wood. We reach this
conclusion even though there
is not sufficient evidence to reach any conclusion about what happened to the
envelope. We find that
Dr Wood did not accept a gift of money as alleged in he
the gifts of wine and the voucher amount to too much, too often?
Complaint is made that the conduct in accepting the gifts of wine and the
voucher amount to improper or unethical conduct as referred
to in section
139B(1)(l) of the National Law. Those words are not defined in the National Law
and are to be given their ordinary
meaning within the context of the statute.
One of the objectives of the National Law, section 3(2), is:
provide for the protection of the public by ensuring that only health
practitioners who are suitably trained and qualified to practice
in a competent
and ethical manner are registered.
approach our consideration in that context.
relevant conduct is conduct that relates to the practice of medicine. The gifts
were given as a patient to a doctor in recognition
of the service provided by
the doctor. The receiving of the gifts related to the practice of medicine.
might the receipt of gifts be improper or unethical? It was conceded by the
Commission and for Dr Wood (although we have not
needed to determine) that the
receipt of the money would amount to unsatisfactory professional conduct. The
Commission says that
the gifts of wine and the voucher were too much, too often,
a position that acknowledges that some level of gift giving would not
the National Law. That position also implies that there is something about
receiving gifts that would be improper or
unethical. Dr Wood did not argue that
receiving gifts could
never be improper or unethical, but rather that the level of his receipt of
gifts was not of that level.
difficulty is identifying when the receiving of gifts becomes improper or
unethical. What is unethical may be measured by what
the medical profession
regards as the standard of behaviour expected of those within the profession.
Good Medial Practice
Exhibit 1, Tab 86
) is a source of those
expected standards, though it only deals briefly with the issue. Paragraph
3.2.5 recognises the power imbalance
in the relationship and warns against
exploitation. That warning is echoed in paragraph
8.2.2 with a further reference to exploitation. Paragraph 8.12 concerns
financial and commercial dealings with patients, a topic
that can encompass
gifts. The provisions do not address the issue directly, except to prescribe
encouraging patients to give gifts
that have a direct or indirect benefit, but
without more guidance.
gifts will have some benefit, so the warning is essentially one of ‘not
encouraging’. That ethical requirement (at
least based on the material
provided to us) is one understood from the perspective of the practitioner
– the assessment is
whether there is encouragement by the practitioner. If
there was no encouragement then the receipt of the gift would not, absent
factors, breach the principles set out in
Good Medical Practice
ethical standard expressed in
Good Medical Practice
does not appear to
require an assessment by the practitioner of how the patient sees the issue of
the giving of the gift affect the
relationship.
does the patient give the gift? It may be a simple one-off thank you, or that
gift giving is a habit or custom of the patient.
It may be with the intent of
creating some obligation in the practitioner. It may be something done almost
without thought, and
routinely. It may be done because the patient thought it
was expected. Perhaps once a gift is given it is difficult not to give
the next occasion. Does the patient feel exploited? Does the patient feel
obliged to give to ensure good service? Is
there a burdensome cost? What effort
was involved?
seems to us that the question of whether the conduct is unethical cannot be
assessed by a practitioner without the practitioner
interrogating the issue
– by self- reflection, by discussion with peers, and most importantly by
talking to the patient and
underscoring that medical treatment will be just as
good whether gifts are given or not. How this might be done could well vary
from practice to practice, and patient to patient.
delivery of a flamboyant gift to a surgery may unsettle those waiting,
especially if they do not have a gift. An inexpensive bottle
of wine might be
too expensive for some. A tin of homemade biscuits may have kept the patient
baking late the night before. On
the other hand the giving of a gift may well
be of benefit to the patient and the relationship – a chance to say
and bring a significant health event to a conclusion. What is said
when the gift is given will be relevant.
receipt of gift by a practitioner without the practitioner reflecting on how the
gift might affect the doctor-patient relationship
could well amount to unethical
conduct. In our view it is not enough for a practitioner to simply conclude that
the gift was not
encouraged.
considerations apply to what might be considered improper conduct. It would be
improper if the gift giving and receiving were
to harm or somehow influence the
doctor-patient relationship. What is important is whether the practitioner has
given consideration
to how it is that the giving and receiving of gifts affects
the patient and the relationship. It is not enough for practitioners
satisfy themselves that a gift was not encouraged.
considering this question we were assisted by the submissions of the Commission
in identifying various aspects of the giving of
gifts that might assist in the
analysis of whether the receiving of gifts was unethical or improper: monetary
value; was it given
during current treatment; the nature of the gift; the
frequency; over what period of time; novelty of the gift; a personal or generic
gift; does the gift reflect a preference of the practitioner; is the gift given
directly or impersonally; in what context; is there
another relationship;
motivation for the gift; is the gift open or secret; motivation in the giving;
any vulnerability of the patient;
disclosure by the practitioner of information
that ‘fashions’ the gift; is continued acceptance encouragement; any
to discourage giving; and attempts to return the gift. The list is not
exhaustive.
Wood said he has received gifts from other patients and that the Ex-serviceman
gave more than most. Dr Wood knew that he was a
man who liked giving gifts, and
took the approach that it was his way of dealing with the world. Though the Ex-
serviceman knew
Dr Wood’s fees were paid through his Veterans Gold Card,
he wanted to do more to show his thanks. There was no evidence of
encouragement
of the gifts, except as may have been implied through the acceptance of the
gifts. It would have been desirable for
Dr Wood to have been active in
responding to the gifts from the Ex-serviceman, such as by having an explicit
conversation about why
gifts were given and reinforcing that there was no need for them. After all
the gifts were not infrequent or received for on isolated
events, and there was
evidence that the frequency and volume were increasing. Dr Wood could have
considered making notes of when
the gifts were received, so as to gain
perspective on what the Ex- serviceman was doing. Had he done so, any change in
would have been obvious, and might have prompted Dr Wood to consider
whether there was some change in his patient’s behaviour.
That it may
have been preferable for Dr Wood to deal with the issue in another way, not
doing so cannot be described as improper
or unethical, particularly in the
context of their relationship and the desire of the Ex- serviceman, and perhaps
his need, to keep
giving gifts.
from the Ex-serviceman and others were often left at the reception desk. When
giving evidence Dr Wood referred to his practice
of requiring that the patient
be asked to remain so at the next convenient moment the practitioner could speak
personally, acknowledge
the gift, thank them, and say the gift is not expected.
The evidence from Dr Wood is that Ex-serviceman gave the gifts of wine directly
to him. Nevertheless that Dr Wood has some system for dealing with gifts
supports our conclusion that Dr Wood behaved in a similar
Ex-serviceman.
factor is the evidence of the Ex-serviceman’s friends. From their
statements and the evidence of one, it is apparent
that the Ex-serviceman
enjoyed giving gifts and it was part of his character. He never complained of
having to give gifts, and
indeed asked his friends to help him deliver the
gifts. On the evidence before us there was no exploitation by Dr Wood of the
relationship.
The gift-giving was driven by the Ex-serviceman himself. The
gifts were of minimal value. The refusal of the gift of money would
an opportune time to have a more thorough conversation about gift-giving, but
the failure to do so, in context, does not
amount to unsatisfactory professional
Dr Wood improperly fail to engage with the Ex-serviceman’s granddaughter
as enduring guardian between 12 September 2013 and
9 December 2013
Wood was aware that the granddaughter had been appointed enduring guardian, as
she had written to Dr Wood on 5 August 2013 and
told him so in the course of
raising some concerns about her grandparents (

it would operate if, because of a disability,

Complaint is not based on an allegation that the Ex-serviceman had become
partially or totally incapable such that the enduring
guardianship had become

circumstances – in short that the
granddaughter had real concerns and was
acutely interested in medical matters to do with her grandfather. The Complaint
Dr Wood should have informed her of the Ex-serviceman’s request
for a further assessment of his cognitive abilities after Dr
assessment of 12 September 2013, and that Dr Wood was proposing to refer him to
a geriatric specialist practitioner
after the earlier assessment by a
psychiatrist.
if we were to accept the genuineness of the concerns and interest, we do not see
how the conduct of Dr Wood in not consulting
with the enduring guardian as to
those matters could amount to unsatisfactory professional conduct within the
meaning of section
139B of the National Law.
were Dr Wood to have spoken to the granddaughter he would have breached the
confidentiality of the relationship. It hardly
needs to be stated, but it is
certainly clear from
Good Medical Practice
that to do so would have been
a breach of standards, and most likely amount to unsatisfactory professional
Wood gave evidence that he was of the view that the Ex-serviceman was fully
capable of managing his medical affairs, and there
is no evidence to the
contrary. It is not to the point that the granddaughter may have had a genuine
interest in knowing what was
happening, even if she was not involving herself in
his health decisions by accompanying him when he saw Dr Wood. If the
Ex-serviceman
chose not to tell her, then there was no legal obligation or any
other requirement on Dr Wood to tell her.
being so we make no adverse finding on this aspect of the Complaint.
there a medical basis in seeking the opinion from Dr Delohery
was about 16 October 2013 (the precise date is not material) that Dr Wood
referred the Ex-serviceman to Dr Delohery for a ‘Cognitive
), in particular for testamentary capacity and mental
ability to drive a car.
Complaint is that Dr Wood did so without appropriate medical or therapeutic
purpose in that there was no sufficient clinical indication
for the assessment
so soon after the earlier assessment by Dr Subau of 12 September 2013 and
without first contacting Dr Subau to
discuss the matter.
immediate response to this aspect of the Complaint as particularised is that we
see no general basis upon which Dr Wood was somehow
obliged to inform Dr Subau
before making a referral to another practitioner, even if for the same
assessment as had recently been
made by Dr Subau. Further, we do not accept the
limitation of ‘
clinical indication’ before a new
referral could be made, at least if that phrase is intended as a qualification
on the making
of a referral in the interests of the patient.
any event, the evidence shows that Dr Wood had ample basis to make the
Suzanne Wood made the referral to Dr Subau at the request of the family when she
was making a home visit. She did not have the
same knowledge of the Ex-
serviceman as did Dr Wood. Her referral was brief and did not include a history
of recent medications
or that the Ex-serviceman had been involved in a car
accident a few months before. Dr Subau concluded the Ex-serviceman was
early dementia of a mixed Alzheimer/vascular type, with recent
deterioration and that he was now unable to manage his financial affairs.
Ex-serviceman came to see Dr Wood and requested a second opinion. Dr Wood saw
from the report that
Dr Subau did not have a full history, and was not aware of recent medications
or the motor vehicle accident. Dr Wood thought the Ex-serviceman,
at the time of
seeing Dr Subau, might have been suffering from delirium from the effects of
medication following the car accident.
Dr Wood was of the view that when he saw
the Ex- serviceman he was then capable and much better than he had been a month
or so before.
The Ex-serviceman attended with a close friend who told Dr Wood
that the Ex-serviceman was still affected by medication when he saw
Dr Subau but
much better and had returned to his old self. Indeed it was at the urging of
his friends who noticed an improvement in his condition
that prompted the
Ex-serviceman to see Dr Wood for a reassessment. Also the Ex-serviceman was
insisting on a second opinion as he
was now restricted in driving his car and
could not sign cheques.
do not conclude that the mere request by a patient for a second opinion is
sufficient basis for a referral, but the fact that a
patient is making that
request can be a reason for a referral in the context of acting in the
patient’s interests. As identified
above Dr Wood had a number of other
reasons for the making the referral, particularly as he thought Dr
Subau’s report was
a limited point in time assessment and was at odds with
Dr Wood’s assessment of the Ex-serviceman made over many years. Dr
chose a geriatric specialist rather than a psychiatrist, because of his view
that what was required was a broader assessment
than had been undertaken by
Dr Subau. Dr Wood provided a brief history with reference to the motor
vehicle accident and included a schedule of recent medications.
There was a
sound medical basis to make the referral.
information provided with the referral was perhaps not as detailed as it could
have been; in particular Dr Wood did not inform
Dr Delohery about Dr
Subau’s report. Even allowing for the Ex-serviceman’s objection to
Dr Subau, it was open to Dr Wood
to have spoken to Dr Subau as part of his
consideration in making the referral to
Dr Delohery. But we do not say that was necessary. The failure to do so was
not a departure from the expected standard. Overall
there is nothing in Dr
Wood’s practice that could be said to be unsatisfactory professional
This aspect
of the Complaint is not made out.
Dr Wood have a basis for concluding in December 2013 that the Ex-serviceman was
cognitively competent?
some aspects this part of the Complaint is related to the part above, as they
both concern Dr Wood’s assessment that in September
2013 the Ex-serviceman
was most likely suffering a temporary delirium from the medication for the motor
vehicle accident and not
dementia. When Dr Wood received the report from Dr
Delohery along with some other assessments he concluded that the Ex-serviceman
was capable and able to drive. It is this assessment that is challenged.
was evidence about whether in September the Ex-serviceman was still taking
medication for pain from the accident, and if not,
whether he could nevertheless
still be suffering the effects some time later. Dr Kertesz was of the view that
the effects of the
medication could not have lasted that long and that dementia
was the preferred conclusion. He initial assessment was that the diagnosis
‘inappropriate and medically incorrect’, but was less critical in
response to our questions.
the hearing further information came to hand about what pain medication was
prescribed or supplied to the Ex-serviceman and
the circumstances in which he
may have used it.
Wood argued for and explained his different assessment. He did so by reference
to his knowledge of how the medication would have
affected the Ex-serviceman and
for how long. It is clear that he was thoughtful and considered in his
assessment, and displayed knowledge
of the relevant issues. He also refers to
Dr Delohery’s assessment of 9 December 2013 that the Ex-serviceman had
‘appropriate
There was nothing in Dr Delohery’s reports to suggest that Dr Wood
should reject it, put aside his own assessment and instead
rely only on Dr
Subau’s report.
is not necessary that we resolve the particular issue of whether the
Ex-serviceman may have been suffering from a temporary delirium
at the time he
saw Dr Subau. It is enough that we conclude that the diagnosis was open to Dr
Wood, and may well have been correct.
We do not conclude that Dr Wood’s
practice was significantly below the standard reasonably expected.
