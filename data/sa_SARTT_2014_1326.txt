The Tribunal at the outset of the hearing gave the parties an opportunity to
discuss the matter by way of reaching an agreed outcome,
however this was
The Tribunal set out clearly at the beginning of the tenancy the law as set
out in Section 56 of the Act concerning such as application
The tenants bring this application primarily motivated by the
landlord’s intention to increase rent from the above weekly amount
$545.00 per week as from 1 April 2014. The tenants are of the view that this
rent increase and indeed their current level of
rent is excessive when compared
with similar properties in this area and comparable areas.
The Tribunal notes that rent was last increased from $500.00 per week to
$530.00 from 4 October 2013.
The landlord does not agree that the rent is excessive but however offered to
delay the rent increase to September 2014 or as an alternative
to forgo any
further rent increases for the remainder of the tenancy in return for the
landlord being relieved of all maintenance
responsibilities for the
The landlord’s offer is not acceptable to the tenants and indeed as the
Tribunal clearly pointed out the option of removing
the landlord’s
responsibility of maintenance would be a breach of Section 68 of the Act.
Throughout the hearing the Tribunal
formed the opinion that Ms Dube as landlord
had a poor understanding of this Section of the Act.
The tenants in support of their application pointed to six rental properties
one of which was in the same suburb as the rental premises,
the other five being
in surrounding suburbs at Glenalta, Bellevue Heights (2 properties) ,
Hawthorndene and Craigburn Farm. The
tenants printouts from realestate.com
showed that all of these properties were comparable in size (with an average of
four bedrooms
and two bathrooms), to the rental premises. Some of the
properties were indeed larger with more bedroom options. All the properties
other than that at Craigburn Farm were currently or very recently for rent at
rents between $440.00 to $475.00 per week. The $475.00
property also included
garden maintenance in that cost. All the properties had comparable heating and
cooling, some had dishwashers
unlike the rental premises. The gardens of a
number were well landscaped and user friendly. The gardens of the rental
are on a steep slope and are of more a native bush type.
The Craigburn Farm property is part of a modern relatively high quality
estate complex, it has four bedrooms, a study, a double spa
bath and has low
maintenance gardens with a gardener as part of the lease. The rent is $525.00
Some of the above properties have swimming pools whereas the rental premises
do not. However the tenants did not put great emphasis
on this issue.
The landlord disputed that these premises should be compared with the rental
premises and tendered an appraisal by her former property
manager, Mr De Jonge
who knows the property, that $530.00 would be the market rent for this property.
As stated at the hearing the neighbourhood of this property and the
surrounding suburbs are reasonably well known to me due to regular
visits over
the last 20 years. I could not say the same about many other suburbs of
The tenants did raise some issues as regards the landlord’s tardiness
in carrying out repairs but while there has been an issue,
agree that the
premises are now in reasonable state of repair.
Having regard to all the above evidence and the fact that the capital value
of these premises can be estimated as in the region of
$490,000 to $500,000 but
attaching most relevance to the evidence concerning comparable properties I find
that the current rent is
I will set the rent at $510.00 per week to take effect from 1 April 2014 for
twelve months.
The tenants raised the issue of a water bill paid in full by them at the
beginning of the tenancy, inclusive of sewerage charges and
Murray River levy
along with the usage period prior to their tenancy. They have raised this issue
to the landlord but have never
been reimbursed. I should order that $140.00 of
this bill be reimbursed by way of a credit to the next rental payment.
current rent of the premises of 18 Meadowvale Road, Coromandel Valley SA 5051 is
excessive. I will fix the rent at the amount
of $510.00 per week from 1 April
2014 for a period of twelve months.
landlord must pay to the tenant the sum of $140.00 by way of immediate credit to
the rent record.
