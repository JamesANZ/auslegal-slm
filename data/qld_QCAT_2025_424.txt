APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
REASONS FOR DECISION
12 July 2021 the applicant filed an application to review the respondent’s
decision that he had engaged in misconduct,
as defined in the
Police Service
Administration Act
(“PSA Act), in the manner in which he had
investigated and finalised information received from a female child’s
the respondent, a sanction was imposed that he be demoted
from Senior Constable
2.10 to Constable 1.6 for three months, suspended after six weeks, subject to no
further grounds for discipline
being committed for a period of 12 months from
the date of the sanction.
[2] On 22 May
2024 the Tribunal delivered a decision that Matter 1 although substantiated, did
not constitute official misconduct
and the respondent’s decision that it
constituted official misconduct was set aside. Given that outcome the parties
were directed
to file submissions to review the sanction imposed having regard
to the Tribunal’s decision. Both parties have filed submissions
applicant’s submission is in short compass. He contends that as the
sanction imposed was based on a finding of misconduct,
the sanction should be
fully reversed. That is on the basis that the “sanction is null and
void”. No alternative sanction
submission over simplifies the task of the Tribunal in a review under
Crime and Corruption Act
(Qld). As discussed in the primary
decision this is not a merits review under s 20 of the QCAT Act and therefore
the issue is whether
the sanction imposed was manifestly excessive in the
circumstances or some other error warrants a different outcome.
[5] Even though
it was determined that the applicant’s conduct was not misconduct as
defined, he did concede his conduct was
“careless”. The Tribunal
went a little further and found it was “careless, incompetent and
inefficient” within
Police Service Administration
(Qld) (“PSA Act”). Even so, the respondent
contends that the sanction should remain the same and that it was not manifestly
excessive when having regard to the factors taken into account by the respondent
for its imposition, which are not disputed.
factors are in summary:
(a) The investigation was in relation to a possible serious offence involving a
(b) The breach of the QPS policy and the
Child Protection Act
the applicant failed to interview the child at school;
(c) Discussing the matter with the child’s mother before discussing it
with the child, and in the absence of another officer;
(d) Finalising the investigation without OIC approval, which could have
potentially compromised the integrity of any further investigation;
(e) Failing to comply with QPS policy which requires all officers to ensure
investigations are finalised only with OIC approval;
(f) The applicants failure to comply with legislation and policy may have
created harm to the child, presumably if further evidence
came to hand, and also
the reputation of the QPS.
[7] Although s
7.4 of the PSA Act identifies various grounds for taking disciplinary action,
the respondent submits that when read
with the explanatory notes to the Police
Service Administration (Discipline Reform) and other Legislation Amendment Bill
is the conduct rather than its categorisation that has to be
considered. The explanatory note sets out the purpose of s 7.4 as
The Bill removes the artificial distinctions of misconduct and breach of
discipline and replaces these categories with the term a
ground for disciplinary
action. A ground for disciplinary action will encompass the behaviours that are
currently listed in s. 9
- Grounds for Disciplinary Action of the Discipline
Regulation and incorporates the definition of breach of discipline. The removal
of the separate and distinct discipline categories of breach of discipline and
misconduct will assist in simplifying the police discipline
system, as the
ability to review a decision for the sanction imposed for improper conduct will
not be dependent upon the categorisation
of behaviour. If an officer is found to
have committed the alleged behaviour, a sanction will be imposed that is
commensurate with
the seriousness of the allegation, regardless of whether it
would have been previously classified as a breach of discipline or misconduct
[8] On this
basis the respondent submits that the sanction imposed reflects the
applicant’s improper conduct irrespective of
its categorisation, be it
“misconduct” or “careless, incompetent and inefficient”
conduct. That is because
all of the circumstances of the conduct were considered
in coming to the sanction imposed, and it was appropriate in the
circumstances.
[9] If it was
just the conduct that determined the sanction, the question is then raised as to
why the need to categorise the various
grounds of conduct. Obviously, by its
very description, any conduct that would constitute “misconduct”
would be more
serious than the lesser ground of being careless, incompetent or
inefficient. By way of example misconduct, if seriousness enough,
may warrant
dismissal. Whereas no matter how serious the lesser ground, it would not warrant
dismissal. There are probably other
examples where the conduct is borderline in
terms of categorisation, and the sanction imposed could easily be appropriate
misconduct and the lesser conduct in the circumstances.
[10] Here the
respondent sanctioned the applicant on the basis that he engaged in misconduct.
That is reflected in what is particularised
in [6] above. Whereas the Tribunal
found that the same conduct fell within the lesser category. The conduct did not
change and therefore,
the sanction imposed must be appropriate for the lesser
conduct. However, it is not for this Tribunal to simply impose its own views
imposition the sanction imposed, now for the lesser category.
In the words of
Judicial Member McGill in
it is “necessary
for the applicant to show some legal, factual or discretionary error before the
reviewing Tribunal could
interfere.”
sanction imposed for the conduct was demotion from Senior Constable 2.10 to
Constable 1.6 for short period then three months
and then suspended after six
(6) weeks. Such a sanction could fall within the “borderline” cases
referred to above.
[12] Having
regard to the range of sanctions that might be imposed under s 7.34 of the PSA
Act, going from reprimand to demotion and
dismissal, the applicant has not
provided any cogent reason, by way of evidence or submission, why this sanction
is inappropriate
or manifestly excessive. I have not been provided with any
comparative cases. The purpose of the sanction is to deter, both the applicant
and other officers from engaging in similar conduct. Or, generally disregarding
protocols and procedures in place under the Operation
Procedure Manual.
[13] Unless
there is some basis to challenge the sanction imposed, other than just the
categorisation of ground of sanction, it remains
relevant to have regard to what
was said in
Alridge v Ross,
that it is appropriate that the Tribunal give
“considerable weight to the view of the original decision-maker who might
thought to have particular expertise in the managerial requirements of the
police force”
sanction imposed, although for misconduct, is not so severe to fall within the
manifestly excessive category. The reasons
given by the Chief Superintendent
considered all necessary matters, including the applicant’s submissions in
coming to his
decision. The effect of the sanction is, in essence, that the
applicant has lost the differential in income in rank for a period
of six weeks.
Therefore, I cannot see any basis upon which the Tribunal can interfere with the
[15] The order
of the Tribunal will be that the decision of the respondent, insofar as it
relates to sanction, is confirmed.
