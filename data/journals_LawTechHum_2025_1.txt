Profiles of the Future
Humans are storytellers. Long before the invention of writing, storytelling
was already an important part of human culture. Archaeological
evidence suggests
that narratives have been a part of human experience for tens of thousands of
years. Prehistoric cave paintings,
such as those found in Kimberley in
and Karampuang in
date back approximately
17, 30, and 50 thousand years, and depict vivid scenes of animals, hunting, and
abstract symbols. These images
reveal that the artists of the Palaeolithic had
sophisticated cognitive processes, which they used to share myths, reinforce
identity, and teach survival
In this light, we can view
cave art as an early form of storytelling, capturing communal histories,
transmitting cultural values,
or communicating spiritual
The pictorial narratives etched into stone and painted on cave walls laid the
groundwork for humanity’s written storytelling
However, we cannot
overstate the significance of oral storytelling. Indigenous cultures around the
world have rich oral histories,
some of which coincide with scientific accounts
of ancient geological events. For instance, the oral traditions of Australian
Nations describe the submergence of coastal lands after the last Ice Age,
which geological data suggests dates these narratives back
more than ten
thousand years.
In this respect,
the continuous storytelling practices of Australian First Nations peoples
exemplify how oral narratives sustain
complex systems of ancestral law, cultural
identity, and ecological knowledge across thousands of
generations.
Similarly, but
emerging much later within written traditions, narratives such as the
(circa 2100 BCE) and the
(circa 800 BCE)
captured human struggles, aspirations, and realities, providing valuable
insights into the ethics and cultural identities
Despite millennia and
countless new narratives, the structure of our stories has largely remained
unchanged, demonstrating the enduring
power of storytelling in reflecting and
shaping human experience.
Storytelling is fundamental to human nature and deeply ingrained in our
cognitive architecture.
instinctively create narratives to organise the chaos of life, essentially
creating simulations for social and moral
decision-making.
Some cognitive
scientists believe that narrative thinking is the primary mode of thought that
shapes both individual identity and
cultural belief
From an evolutionary
standpoint, narratives aid survival by allowing us to mentally rehearse social
situations, solve problems, and
form collective
identities.
Stories can also
increase empathy by allowing audiences to feel the emotions of fictional
characters, which promotes cooperation
understanding.
Frontier technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and
virtual reality, have dramatically altered
storytelling.
AI, for example,
enables new forms of generative storytelling in which algorithms can create
plotlines, characters, and adapt narratives
in real time based on user
storytelling now exists across multiple platforms, encouraging active audience
participation and collaborative narrative
Big data analytics
enables creators to tailor content to individual preferences, fine-tuning story
arcs based on real-time feedback
and engagement
Meanwhile, virtual
reality promotes immersive narrative experiences, bridging the physical and the
Despite all of these technological advancements, storytelling continues to be
an important tool for understanding and shaping our
social reality—the
ancient human impulse to make sense of the world through stories persists. As
Karen Schultz
explores in her article,
Utopia and Intellectual
Humility: More, Bacon, and Swift Appraising Law and Technology
narratives about legal and technological advancement are not only descriptive
but also deeply formative, shaping how societies perceive
progress. Schultz
advocates for intellectual humility, acknowledging the limitations of human
judgement when dealing with new technologies.
She looks at how classic utopian
literature, such as More’s
, and Swift’s
Gulliver’s Travels
storytelling to question legal and technological paradigms. Her choice of
literature reminds us that legal and technological
imaginaries are not new;
rather, they are part of a long-standing storytelling tradition that influences
our expectations and fears
a cultural artefact; stories shape the social world, technology, and our shared

As explained above, stories do more than reflect reality; they actively shape
how we perceive and interact with the world. Narratives
complexity by assisting us in interpreting events, creating meaning, and making
decisions. However, the power
of storytelling is two-sided: while narratives
in ways that distort our
perspectives.
When we make
decisions based on compelling but flawed narratives, we risk creating a world
built on false assumptions. This is particularly
evident in techno-optimistic
narratives, in which the promise of technological progress is frequently taken
at face value, resulting
in regulatory frameworks that assume innovation will
solve societal problems while ignoring underlying structural
Henrique Marcos
explains in his article,
Save Us: Climate Crisis, Techno-Optimism, and International Law
techno-optimism is the belief that technological advancements lead to progress
by addressing social, political, and environmental
issues without requiring
major structural changes. This viewpoint holds that technology is neutral,
self-correcting, and capable
of overcoming the constraints of human
decision-making. Marcos argues that this narrative is deeply embedded in current
climate policy.
He criticises the assumptions of techno-optimism, arguing that
international environmental law’s reliance on technological
frequently ignores deeper systemic issues. The promotion of electric vehicles
(EVs) as a climate solution is one of the
examples he uses to discuss this
misdirected optimism. While EVs reduce direct tailpipe emissions, they do not
address the broader
environmental costs of battery production, resource
extraction, and energy consumption.
Another area where techno-optimism influences legal frameworks is judicial
decision-making, specifically the belief in AI’s
potential to reduce human
bias in adjudication. The assumption that AI can serve as an impartial tool,
free of the cognitive and
social biases that affect human judges, has resulted
in a growing use of AI-assisted decision-making tools in courts. However, as
Giovana Peluso Lopes
points out in
Bias in Adjudication and the
Promise of AI: Challenges to Procedural Fairness
, this assumption is
fundamentally flawed. While some regard AI as a neutral actor, it is actually
shaped by the data it is trained
on, the biases of its developers, and the
socio-legal contexts in which it operates. Lopes demonstrates how, far from
eliminating
bias, AI can exacerbate existing disparities in legal
decision-making, particularly in risk assessments, sentencing recommendations,
and predictive policing. As a result, the techno-optimist belief in AI as a
solution to judicial bias may inadvertently introduce
new and more pernicious
forms of prejudice into the law.
While techno-optimism frequently results in an overestimation of
technology’s ability to solve complex problems, lawmaking in
technologies is also influenced by negative emotions, particularly fear and
suspicion. This is especially evident in the
regulation of quantum technologies,
where the law is shaped not only by expectations of future breakthroughs, but
also by geopolitical
fears and security concerns that far outweigh current
technological realities.
Anh Nguyen’s
Controls as Innovation Marketing? Sociotechnical Imaginaries in the Ringfencing
of Quantum Technologies
investigates how fear, rather than
technological necessity, motivates restrictive policies on quantum computing and
encryption. Governments
around the world have imposed export controls and
national security restrictions on quantum technologies, despite the fact that
operational quantum computers do not exist. It would seem that the idea of
restricting non-existent technology is based on the belief
that whoever masters
quantum computing first will dominate global security, finance, and
cybersecurity. However, Nguyen claims that
these restrictions are motivated by
geopolitical positioning rather than actual technological threats. This is not
an isolated phenomenon;
the law is frequently motivated by speculative fears
The Lathe of Heaven
The law does more than just respond to technological change; it actively
influences how technology is perceived, regulated, and integrated
into society.
Optimistic narratives, on the one hand, encourage funding, innovation, and
deregulation, reinforcing the belief that
technology will solve society’s
most pressing issues. Fear-driven narratives, on the other, justify control and
restriction,
which are frequently based on speculative rather than actual
threats. Both narratives influence the law in ways that go beyond technological
reality, demonstrating that the law is not only reactive but also active in
shaping how we understand, anticipate, and regulate new
technologies.
Lawyers are more than just characters in the narrative of technology; they
are storytellers who create, challenge, and redefine the
stories that shape the
official policy and public perception of technological advancements. The way
legal professionals frame issues
– whether positioning AI as a tool for
justice, portraying quantum technologies as national security threats, or
environmental regulations within techno-optimist frameworks –
has a significant impact on how laws are structured and enforced.
If the law is
a tool for narrative construction, legal professionals must recognise their role
as storytellers (and, perhaps more
importantly, narrative builders), ensuring
that the legal frameworks governing frontier technologies are founded on fact
rather than
myth and that they serve the public interest rather than simply
reinforcing existing power
structures.
The regulation of biomedical technologies is a clear example of how lawyers
construct narratives about technology.
Mirko Djukovic’s
New Organs in Command: The Regulatory Prospects of 3D Bioprinting
investigates how the law is actively shaping how bioprinting technology is
perceived, classified, and integrated into regulatory
frameworks. At the heart
of the regulatory challenge is the dual nature of bioprinted products –
they contain both biological
and synthetic materials, making them difficult to
classify under existing legal frameworks insofar as current regulations
tissue engineering, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices do not fully
account for the complexity of bioprinting. Yet Djukovic contends
that the lack
of clear categorisation is more than just a result of legal ambiguity; it
reflects how the law constructs reality.
In this respect, Djukovic highlights
how bioprinting regulation is a deeply narrative-driven process, not at all a
purely technical
one. The dominant legal narratives surrounding medical
innovation frequently portray regulatory frameworks as balancing two opposing
interests: the promise of cutting-edge technology to save lives and the need for
ethical oversight.
As lawyers construct and reinforce narratives on technology, one of their
most important responsibilities is to define the boundaries
of legal concepts
such as personhood and agency. These concepts are not static; rather, they
evolve in response to social, political,
and technological changes, which are
shaped by legal narratives. Nowhere is this more evident than in the legal
treatment of AI and
neurotechnology, where traditional legal categories are
being challenged, redefined, and even eliminated.
Talya Deibel
Eric Deibel’s
Forgotten Boundaries in Law: On AI and
Neurotechnology
, investigates how law has long relied on the myth of the
‘natural person,’ creating the notion that there is an absolute
divide between the human and the non-human. However, as AI and neurotechnologies
blur the distinctions between human and machine,
mind and data, autonomy and
algorithm, the law is being forced to rethink its core categories. Deibel and
Deibel argue that legal
systems are not merely struggling to catch up with
technological advancements – they influence how these technologies are
and integrated into society. This is especially clear in the legal
treatment of AI-generated decisions in healthcare and criminal
justice, where
regulatory frameworks frequently assume that human decision-making differs
fundamentally from machine decision-making.
However, the authors question this
distinction, emphasising how law creates the very boundaries it claims to
A central question in the debate over personhood and agency is whether AI
should be viewed as a mere tool, similar to a paintbrush
or a camera, or whether
it plays a more autonomous role in the creative process. Should AI-created works
be legally recognised as
original work?
Protecting AI-Generated Images as Works of Fine Art in China
looks at the issue through the lens of Chinese copyright law, specifically the
landmark case
in which a Chinese court ruled that an
AI-generated image could be classified as a work of fine art. This decision is
noteworthy for
how it reinforces a specific narrative about AI, creativity, and
human agency. The Chinese court ruled that the AI user, not the
AI itself, was
the legal author of the image because the user’s input (the textual
prompt) was deemed a ‘original’
creative contribution.
Regardless of whether the decision in
is correct, it is part
of a larger trend in the governance of frontier technologies, in which the law
not only regulates new developments
but also creates the categories that define
them. Just as regulatory frameworks for bioprinting determine whether printed
are considered human or synthetic and legal definitions struggle to
maintain the notion of ‘natural person’, the legal
approach to AI-generated content determines whether AI is treated as an agent, a
tool, or somewhere in between. These
are not just legal decisions; they are
narrative choices that influence how society perceives and interacts with
emerging technologies.
So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
The stories we tell about technology shape not just how we understand
innovation, but also whether we welcome or fear it. In storytelling,
not a passive element limited to reacting to technological developments; it is a
dynamic force that shapes the boundaries
of what is acceptable or forbidden, as
well as what is possible. As such, lawyers are crucial in determining how
frontier technologies
are regulated, whether through techno-optimism or
fear-based narratives. Lawyers are storytellers who create the narratives that
will shape how technology is governed in our society. As legal scholars and
practitioners, it is our responsibility to make sure
that these narratives are
shaped by a dedication to justice, inclusivity, and a critical understanding of
the role that law plays
in determining our shared future.
This symposium is the result of discussions held at the
Narratives,
Frontier Technology, and the Law
conference on October 30th, 31st, and
2024 in Maastricht, The Netherlands. These discussions
have helped us understand how the law not only regulates technological change,
but actively defines the space in which it occurs. The articles in this
collection demonstrate the dual role of law as both a stabiliser
of existing
power structures and a space for critical intervention, emphasising how lawyers
must engage with technology not as an
external phenomenon, but as an internally
constructed narrative that calls for scrutiny. The governance of frontier
technologies
is frequently framed through a Western lens; however, the
narratives that underpin technological regulation affect people all over
world. Recognising who gets to tell the story of technological governance is as
important as the regulations themselves. In this
respect, we find it important
to highlight that this conference was led by two non-European scholars, both
