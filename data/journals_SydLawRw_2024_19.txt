Trustees’ Indemnities and Fiduciary Duties: The High Court Appeal in
Naaman v Jaken Properties Australia Pty Ltd
The High Court of Australia appeal in
v Jaken Properties
raises the question whether a successor trustee owes a ‘fiduciary
duty’ to the former trustee to not destroy, jeopardise
or diminish the
former trustee’s right of indemnity over trust assets. That question
arises to determine whether third parties
are liable to account in equity as
knowing recipients of property dissipated to frustrate the former
trustee’s indemnity. It
is argued in the appeal that the successor trustee
holds the trust assets on express trust for the former trustee to the extent of
the former trustee’s indemnity. That conclusion does not account for the
variety of equitable interests. Three main points
emerge. First, a current
trustee has a ‘beneficial interest’ in trust assets only in a
superficial sense. Second, upon
transfer, that ‘beneficial interest’
is not ‘retained’ by the former trustee; the entitlement of a former
trustee over the trust fund changes, and becomes analogous to a charge over a
fund. The language of ‘beneficial interest’
in each case is
misleading and should be eschewed. Third, it is unnecessary to ask, for the
purposes of
Barnes v Addy
liability, whether any ‘duty’ owed
by a successor to a former trustee is a ‘fiduciary duty’.
Introduction
Naaman v Jaken
the High Court of
Australia will have occasion to consider the obligations, if any, owed by a
successor trustee to a former trustee
to honour the former trustee’s right
of recourse to the trust property for properly incurred expenses. That question
to determine the scope of relief available in equity against third
parties who knowingly receive trust assets disbursed to frustrate
trustee’s right of indemnity. To that end, the appellant has framed the
question as whether the relationship between
former and current trustees is
in nature, to render third parties liable to account under
Barnes v Addy
These questions are best answered by considering the fundamental nature of
trustees’ rights of recourse to trust property. What
is the nature of a
former trustee’s right of indemnity? Does it differ from the right of an
incumbent trustee? And is it helpful
to speak of ‘the’ right
continuing after retirement and transfer of title?
The issues raised in the pending High Court appeal bring into sharp focus the
fallacy of dual estates, the variety of equitable interests
falling short of the
trust, the relation between fiduciary relationships and third-party liability in
equity, and problems with reasoning
downwards from an imprecise label or
metaphor, such as ‘beneficial interest’, used to describe a legal
relationship.
Importantly, to ask whether any ‘duty’ to honour the indemnity is
a ‘fiduciary duty’ proceeds from a defective
major premise; it is an
unnecessary starting point when determining third-party liability in equity.
The Proceedings
Jaken Property Group Pty Ltd (‘JPG’) was the trustee of the Sly
Fox Family Trust. It incurred various expenses as a trading
trustee. Before it
could recoup those expenses from the trust property, JPG was replaced as trustee
by Jaken Australia Pty Ltd (‘Jaken’),
the first respondent in the
pending appeal. The Deed of Appointment vested title to the assets in Jaken.
Clause 1.5 of the Deed required
Jaken to ‘indemnif[y] the Retiring Trustee
against all debts which the Retiring Trustee has incurred and which are unpaid

is no dispute that the appellant could be subrogated to

parties should be held liable to account for receiving property they knew was

assets of the trust in a way which destroys, diminishes or jeopardises
JPG’s right of indemnity from those

compensation.

The Current Trustee’s Right of
Any consideration of the above must begin with an analysis of the nature of
an incumbent trustee’s right of indemnity. A trust
is a relationship, not
an entity. The trustee is liable personally for all liabilities whether incurred
in the administration of
the trust or otherwise. In exchange, equity suffers the

More fundamentally, the ‘right’ is not securing any debt owed to the

person or persons [and] a ‘lien’ upon property

uses of those
language of ‘charge’ was only properly used in this context to
convey a conclusion about priorities — Maitland
said the trustee has a
‘first charge’ over the assets for their expenses, before
distribution.
Even so, that is not because the trustee has some separate right which takes
priority over the beneficiaries’ equitable
The position is more
negative than positive. Rather, the current trustee’s ‘right’
of indemnity is but an incident
of their ownership. One simply cannot know what
property is — the property for which the trustee must
account in equity to the beneficiaries — until the trustee has
their proper expenses.
One way of putting this is that the current trustee’s indemnity is
simply an expression of trust
accounting.
Describing the
nature of a trustee’s indemnity, Scott said: ‘In rendering his
accounts, [the trustee] credits himself
with the expenditures he has made, and
he is not bound to pay over any of the income to the
cestui que trust
until he has been
reimbursed.’
The upshot is
that, to the extent of those credited expenses, equity stays its hand and does
not encumber the trustee’s recourse
to their legal title. The trustee can
only be called to account for the
That is the
‘indemnity’.

elsewhere, the ‘power’ of appropriating
property to one’s

there is anything equitable about it, is an equitable
true that this immunity leaves the incumbent trustee with a ‘beneficial
interest’ in the assets — but only
in a superficial sense. An
absolute owner does not own two split estates — one legal and one
beneficial.
The Former Trustee’s Right of
That proposition is significant background to the appellant’s argument
that, upon transfer, the former trustee is divested of
legal title, but retains
their ‘beneficial interest’, such that there emerges a
‘split’ in estates typical
of any trust relationship. Critically,
the idea of the former trustee ‘retaining’ the same interest is
problematic.
A current trustee’s right of indemnity is an incident of their
ownership. That is not to say that upon retirement they lose
all recourse;
authority suggests that equity affords the former trustee some form of recourse
to the trust assets. But it is to say
that once a trustee is deprived of legal
title, the juristic nature of their right must

trustee? This has been the subject of more sustained study

be found, each of which owes its peculiar nature to the particular inequity
which it is designed to redress

That is in the nature of equitable execution. All this is to say that labels
and metaphors such as ‘beneficial interest’,
and ‘lien’ prove too much, and they distract from the very
particular function which the former
trustee’s equity fulfils. Hence the
underappreciated force in the Privy Council’s recent statement in
that the former trustee’s equity is ‘

than the right to have the trust property applied’ to their

Trusteeship
Reference has already been made to the appellant’s argument that a

‘continued’
after the trustee loses title to those assets. This was the crux of the
disagreement in the Court of Appeal:
An important difference in my analysis of the issues to that of Leeming and Kirk

interest as being in the nature of a charge or lien

Again, the purchaser under a specifically performable agreement has equities

extent to which equitable remedies are
beneficial interest is not a beneficial estate. As in much of equity, the nature
of the ‘right’ is but an expression
of the sorts of relief and
intervention available. The existence of a ‘right’ is just an
elliptical way of expressing
that certain remedies are available to effect a
certain end.
This is apt to
exasperate the common lawyer. The fundamental point was made extra-curially by
Justice White: ‘The fact that
an owner makes a contract, enforceable by
injunction, as to how he or she will or will not exercise his or her rights of
does not necessarily mean he or she ceases to enjoy “beneficial
ownership”.’
So there is some difficulty with reasoning upward from the availability of
equities grounding injunctive and proprietary relief, to
‘beneficial interest’ or ‘equitable proprietary right’,
and then reasoning downward from that label
to the conclusion that the
beneficial estate is reposed in the former trustee. The problem recalls Justice
Holmes’s salutary
warning that ‘[a]s long as the matter to be
considered is debated in artificial terms, there is a danger of being led by a
technical definition to apply a certain name, and then to deduce consequences

Two points should be made. First, in
the language of
‘beneficial interest’ was only used as an intermediate step, for the
conclusion that the right is ‘property’

Corporations Act 2001

determining whether such property is therefore amenable to distribution
according to
of that Act. Second, and in any event,
Carter Holt
concerned the nature of a
trustee’s indemnity. It said
of the situation of a
trustee which, as we have seen, is fundamentally different. As
explained, the only sense in which a current trustee (superficially)
‘beneficial interest’ is by virtue of their unencumbered ownership.
Again, the submission that ‘there is
no reason in principle why [the
assets] should not also be subject to the
interest of the
former trustee’
assumes that there is one continuous right. So too the submissions in the Court

Brereton J said. It is not a ‘duty’. Still less is it a
‘fiduciary’ duty. The passage simply
recognises that, like in
Cummins v Perkins

dispositions before they are made; the former trustee ‘can ask the court

beneficiaries differentially, accommodates
itself to the exigencies of each
relationship.

being given to some over others (for
example, in unit trusts). And this is to say nothing of the plasticity of the
