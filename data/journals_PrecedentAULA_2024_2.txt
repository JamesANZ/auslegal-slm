Welcoming young practitioners and 2024
Shaun Marcus
Welcome to 2024!
I hope all of our members had a great break with family and friends over the
New Year period. The ALA has a busy year ahead.
FOCUS ON YOUNG PRACTITIONERS
In this edition of
we are lucky to have a range of high
quality articles that are focused on supporting our young practitioners.
The Australian Lawyers Alliance (ALA) is a wonderful organisation for young
practitioners to be a part of. Many of my friends in the
law have come from
attending ALA events and participating in ALA policy development as a young
lawyer. These connections have been
critical to my career. Contacting a
colleague from another firm for a tip on a medical expert, liability expert or
counsel with expertise
in a certain matter is invaluable in legal practice.
Indeed, all of my current partners in my legal practice at Arnold Dallas
Lawyers were met at ALA events.
This year we are planning to introduce CPD events with a particular focus on
young practitioners around the nation. I strongly encourage
all of you to get
involved in these events. They will give you the opportunity to make long-term
connections with fellow practitioners
from other firms and learn more about what
the ALA does for the community.
As you get more involved in the organisation, opportunities will arise for
contribution to policy development, such as joining a special
interest group, or
state or national committee. In 2023 we focused on changes to e-scooter
policies, the introduction of a federal
human rights act, drug law reform, and
freedom of information reforms. In 2024 we plan to expand beyond these issues.
Through your
involvement, you will get the chance to have a material impact on
policy development across Australia and make meaningful changes.
There are significant issues that the ALA will be a leading voice on over the
next 12 months.
Queensland will hold elections; our members are actively working to protect
existing compensation rights. In Victoria, a Bill currently
before Parliament
seeks to significantly erode statutory benefits for injured workers. The ALA has
been the leading legal body resisting
the proposed amendments.
We are very hopeful for tangible amendments to compensation recovery laws.
The ALA has a long and persistent campaign seeking real
changes for statutory
bodies seeking recovery from compensation amounts and we believe this year we
could finally see some meaningful
These are just a couple of examples of the important work our members are
doing to protect the rights of individuals. There are always
challenges for our
members and their clients, and we will keep advocating strongly for solutions.
Following a survey in late 2023, we have created a list of initiatives for
2024 in response to our members’ input. We had some
very insightful and
passionate responses to the survey, which have helped us plan the next chapter
for the ALA. We will keep our
members updated with our progress as we implement
the new goals that we have for the organisation.
We also have some exciting state conferences organised for 2024 and our
National Conference in October will – for the first
time – be held
in Western Australia.
It’s going to be a big year!
