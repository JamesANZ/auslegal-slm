REASONS FOR ORDER
September 1995, I made an ex parte interim order on an
application by the Responsible Authority. Following a Hearing on
September 1995 in the presence of the representatives of all
the parties I mended the interim order and issued an amended order dated
September 1995.
At a Mention Hearing on 2
April 1996, the Tribunal was advised
that the First named Respondent intended applying to the Responsible Authority
for a Planning
Permit to enable rectification works to be carried out on the
land. By letter dated 24
May 1996, Maddock Lonie and Chisholm
Solicitors, acting on behalf of the Responsible Authority, advised that the
Planning Permit
application had been received by the Responsible Authority and
was being processed by it.
By letter dated 4
October 1996, Maddock Lonie and Chisholm
Solicitors advised that the matter had been called-in by the Minister for
Planning and Local
Government and in the circumstances the Hearing of the
application for an Enforcement Order under section 114 of the Act was further
By letter dated 7
March 1997, the Solicitors further advised that
the Minister had referred the Permit Application to an Independent Panel for
consideration.
By letter dated 2
July 1997, the Solicitors advised that the Panel
Hearing had been concluded and the report had been handed to the Minister for

By fax to the Tribunal 2
December 1997, the Solicitors advised
that the Minister had not yet made his recommendation to the
Governor-in-Council but that the
Minister had arranged a site inspection for
December 1997.
By letter to the Tribunal dated 4
June 1998, Maddock Lonie and
Chisholm made an application pursuant to section 121 of the Act to amend the
Interim Enforcement Order
made to allow earthworks and re-vegetation in
accordance with Planning Permit No. P980321. A copy of this permit was
attached to
the letter and it appeared that it issued on 1
1998 and that the permit allows: "to undertake earthworks and re-vegetation in
accordance with the attached endorsed plans".
By fax to the Tribunal dated 12
June 1998, Maddock Lonie and
Chisholm advised as follows:
"We understand that the Minister's recommendations to the
Governor-in-Council is on hold, pending the completion of works allowed
pursuant to Planning Permit No. P980321...
In the meantime, it would be appreciated if the application for Enforcement
Order could be held in abeyance."
The Tribunal subsequently wrote on a number occasions to the Solicitors for the
Responsible Authority seeking advice as to whether
the matter could be resolved
by consent or whether it should be summarily dismissed under section 76 OF THE
Victorian Civil &
Administrative Tribunal Act 1998.
By fax to the Tribunal dated 22
December 1998, Maddock Lonie and
Chisholm Solicitors advised as follows:
"Our client no longer wishes to pursue its application under
section 121
Planning and Environment Act 1987
. Accordingly, we request that the matter
be dismissed with no orders, including orders as to costs."
In the circumstances, the application for an Enforcement Order under section
114 of the Act will be dismissed.
1. The application for an Enforcement Order under section 114 of the Act
is dismissed.
2. No Order is made as to costs.
