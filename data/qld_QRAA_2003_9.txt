RACING APPEALS AUTHORITY
[2003] QRAA 09
: 27 March 2003
Mr Grant Dixon
APPEAL FROM
A decision by the Stewards of the Queensland
Harness Racing Board to suspend his driver's licence for a period of three
BREACH OF RULE:
APPEARANCES
: Mr W Dixon, with the approval of the
Authority, appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr N Torpey, Chairman of
Stewards, appeared on behalf of the Respondent.
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an appeal of Mr Grant Dixon against the decision of the Stewards of
the Queensland Harness Racing Board to suspend his driver's
licence for three
weeks after finding him guilty of breach of Rule 163(1)(a) of the Rules of
Harness Racing which provides:
163. (1) “A driver shall not -
(a) cause or contribute to any crossing, jostling or interference.”
The Appellant in this case was charged as a result of an incident which
occurred on the turn of the front straight at the 200-metre
point of Race 5
being a $65,000.00 3 year-old fillies, QBred Triad Final at Albion Park Raceway
on Saturday, 15 March 2003.
At the Steward's enquiry held after the race the Stewards allege that Mr
Grant Dixon was careless in changing the position of his
horse, Dancing Navaho
from the inside towards a wider position on the track. As a result of that
movement, the horse Kidabout was
checked and went back in the field causing the
horse Heavenly Hiranni to also be checked.
The Appellant appealed both on the finding of the Stewards and penalty.
The video of the race was shown from three different angles. It is clear
that both horses, Kidabout and Heavenly Hiranni were hampered
in their running.
Mr William Dixon submitted to the Authority that the cause of the
interference to Kidabout was not as a result of Dancing Navaho's
movement. He
submitted that Kidabout was laying in on Dancing Navaho coming around the turn
and although there was some slight movement
by Mr Grant Dixon in attempting to
come out, that was not the cause of the interference. Mr William Dixon submits
the main cause
of the interference was the actions of Kidabout lugging back in.
He said the horse was wearing what is commonly known as a Murphy
Blind on the
inside and the purpose of a Murphy Blind is to stop a horse hanging as it
shields the horse from seeing horses on its
The Authority accepts from the video of the race that Kidabout did rebound
but is of the opinion that action was as a result of the
tightening caused to it
by Mr Grant Dixon manoeuvring Dancing Navaho from the two wide position to the
three wide position.
The Authority therefore accepts the Stewards' finding and Mr Dixon, by
manoeuvring the horse as he did, breached Rule 163(1)(a).
With regard to penalty, Mr Torpey submitted that the race was a feature event
and the incident resulted in two horses being interfered
with. Mr Torpey
referred to the recent record of Mr Grant Dixon and stated the Stewards were of
the opinion that a three week suspension
was the appropriate penalty in those
circumstances.
Mr Grant Dixon is a professional driver. He has driven more than 600 drives
this season and currently averages approximately 25 drives
per week. It is
clear that he will be severely penalised by suspension of his licence.
In the circumstances, the Authority considers that a two week suspension
would be the appropriate penalty.
In view of the published driving commitments of Mr Dixon, the Authority
ordered that the two week suspension is to commence from midnight
Saturday, 29
March 2003.
The appeal fee is forfeited.
