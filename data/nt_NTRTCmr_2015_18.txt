REASONS FOR THE ORDER OF THE COMMISSIONER OF TENANCIES
INQUIRY - Wednesday, 13 May 2015
ANNIKA HOGAN AND SIMON FINCH ('TENANTS')
GREGORY BARNES AND MEE BARNES ('LANDLORDS')
RT1415-0586
is a determination of an application by the tenants dated 23 February 2015 in
respect of premises being 15/107 Woods Street,
Darwin in the Northern Territory
of Australia (‘the premises’), seeking an order under s 113 of the
Residential Tenancies Act (NT)
(‘the Act’) for return of part
of the security deposit.
Notice of Inquiry dated 24 March 2015 was posted to the parties. The Inquiry
was conducted on Wednesday, 13 May 2015. The following
appeared at the Inquiry
and made submissions:
the tenants;
the landlords'
agent, Mr Cramond of HomeHunters Darwin.
evidence before the Inquiry consisted of the following materials:
the documents
submitted by the tenants in support of the application and kept on the
Commissioner of Tenancies file numbered RT1415-0586
(‘the file’)
under a marked tab; and
the documents
submitted by the landlords in response to the application and kept under under a
marked tab.
the basis of the above evidence I find there was a tenancy agreement between the
landlord and the tenant in respect of the premises
within the meaning of and
subject to the provisions of the Act. The key details of the tenancy agreement
are as follows:
Duration: fixed term commencing 24 January 2014
and ending 22 January 2015, periodical thereafter to 9 February 2015;
Rent: $720.00 per week payable fortnightly in advance; and
Security Deposit $2880.00.
The application under s 113 for an order for return of part of the
security deposit
the conclusion of the tenancy, the landlords retained a total of $1354.79 from
the security deposit of $2880.00.
tenants do not dispute that the landlords were entitled to retain a sum of
$514.29 on account of unpaid rent; however, they challenge
the landlords'
retention of the balance in the sum of $840.50 ('the disputed sum').
disputed sum had three components:
being part of the costs incurred by the landlords when a fire alarm was falsely
triggered on 14 February 2014 (allegedly
as a result of smoke or fumes caused by
cooking on the premises). The triggering of the alarm led to an attendance by
Northern Territory
Police Fire and Emergency Services, as well as the need for a
contractor to attend and reset the relevant alarm system. Each of NTPFES
contractor invoiced the Body Corporate for the building of which the premises
formed part in respect of their attendances
on 14 February 2014. The Body
Corporate had in turn passed the cost, totalling $1219, on to the landlords and
the landlords claimed
half of that sum from the tenants;
$88.00 - being
the cost to the landlords of an attendance at the premises by a
telecommunications contractor in response to a complaint
by the tenants that the
phone line to the premises had a fault which affected access to broadband
internet services; and
$143.00 - being
the cost to the landlords of an attendance at the premises by a contractor in
response to a complaint by the tenants
regarding an air-conditioner on the
the tenants denied that they were liable to the landlords in respect of any of
the three components of the disputed sum.
matters transpired at the hearing, it was unnecessary for me to adjudicate upon
that issue.
was because there were other bases upon which it was clear to me that the
landlord had no entitlement under the Act to retain
the three sums.
112 of the Act materially provides as follows:
landlord may keep security deposit
(1) Subject to this section, a tenant is entitled to have his or her security
deposit reimbursed at the end of the tenancy agreement.
(2) The landlord must, within 7 business days after the tenant gave up vacant
possession of the premises or has, in the opinion of
the landlord, apparently
abandoned the premises, reimburse to the tenant the amount of the security
deposit, other than an amount
that the landlord is entitled to retain, or to
continue to hold, under this section.
Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.
(3) At the end of a tenancy agreement the landlord is entitled to retain so
much of the security deposit paid by the tenant as is
necessary to:
(a) make good damage (other than reasonable wear and tear) to the premises
or to ancillary property that occurred during the tenancy
and that was caused by
a tenant or a person for whose actions a tenant is liable under section 12;
(b) replace ancillary property lost or destroyed by the tenant or by a person
for whose actions the tenant is liable under section
(c) clean the premises or ancillary property left unreasonably dirty by the
tenant or by a person for whose actions the tenant is
liable under section 12;
(d) replace locks altered, removed or added by the tenant without the consent
of the landlord; or
(e) pay for unpaid rent or for unpaid charges for electricity, gas or water
payable by the tenant under section 118; or
(f) pay an amount required to be paid under section 121; or
(g) pay money ordered by the Commissioner or a court to be paid by a tenant
but not paid.
(5) Subject to section 113(2), the landlord is not entitled to retain, or to
continue to hold under subsection (6), part or all of
a security deposit unless,
within 7 business days after the tenant gave up vacant possession of the
premises or has, in the opinion
of the landlord, apparently abandoned the
premises, the landlord has:
(a) given written notice in the prescribed form, if any, of his or her
intention to retain or continue holding so much of the security
deposit as is
specified in the notice for the purpose specified in the notice; and
(b) attached a copy of a statutory declaration in the prescribed form, if
any, attesting to the truth of the claim that the retention
or continued
holding of the security deposit is required for the purpose specified in the
notice; and
(c) attached a copy of a statutory declaration attesting that the receipts,
invoices or other documents attached to the declaration
(i) the matters in respect of which part or all of the security deposit is
being withheld from the tenant; or
(ii) the amount of unpaid rent owing under the agreement or money owing under
section 121; and
(d) in the case of damage or unreasonably dirty premises or ancillary
property – attached copies of receipts, invoices or other
including orders of the Commissioner or a court, specifying the amount required
to make good the damage or clean the premises
or ancillary property; and
(e) returned to the tenant the proportion of security not claimed by the
landlord or not to be held under subsection (6).
(10) In this section:
end of a tenancy agreement
means, if there is a continuation of
the tenancy to which the tenancy agreement relates, at the end of the
continuation.
19 February 2015, in purported compliance with section 112(5), the landlord's
agent completed a Commissioner of Tenancies form
RT08 notice relevantly recorded:
premises 'were vacated or abandoned on: 09/02/2015'. (It was common ground at
the hearing that this was the correct date);
that the notice
was 'given [to the tenants] on 19/02/2015' by mailing it to them that day;
that the sum of
$840.50 was to be retained from the security deposit for the purpose of "paying
unpaid charges for electricity, gas
or water payable by the tenant
INCURRED INVOICES
". The words in italics were not part of the pre-printed
form RT08 but instead were added to the form in handwriting by the landlord's
to the RT08 notice were invoices relating to the three items comprising the
disputed sum.
RT08 out of time
the hearing on 13 May 2015 I pointed out to the landlords’ agent that it
did not appear that the RT08 notice had been given
in accordance with the
timeframe stipulated in section 112(5), namely within 7 business days after the
date of vacant possession
or abandonment (9 February 2015). By my reckoning,
that period had expired on 18 February 2015.
the usual course, I would have gone on to consider whether to invoke section
113(2) of the Act (which allows non-compliance with
section 112(5) to be excused
in certain limited circumstances); however, there was a much more fundamental
problem with the landlord's
retention of the disputed sum.
Disputed sum not lawfully retained
112(3) of the Act identifies exhaustively the items in respect of which a
landlord is entitled to retain a security deposit
or any part of it. Those
items are reflected in the pre-printed contents of the form RT08. None of the
three amounts comprising
the disputed sum relates to such an item. The simple
fact is that the landlords could not lawfully retain the disputed sum from
security deposit. The addition of the words "or incurred invoices" to the form
RT08 could do nothing to change that legal reality.
landlords' proper remedy in respect of the three items comprising the disputed
sum was to apply for an order for compensation
under section 122 of the Act.
Obtaining such an order would entail establishing that the tenants were legally
liable to the landlords
in respect of those items (for example for breach of the
tenancy agreement).
Disposition
brought the above matters to the parties' attention at the commencement of the
hearing on 13 May 2015. I noted that the consequence
for the landlords, if the
hearing was to proceed, would be an order for the payment of the disputed sum to
the tenants. I further
noted that that consequence would not necessarily mean
an end to the parties' dispute because it would remain open to the landlords
bring an application for compensation.
the circumstances, I suggested to the parties that it might be in their
interests to have discussions with a view to sorting out
all present and future
controversies relating to the tenancy. I indicated that I was prepared to
adjourn the hearing briefly for
the purpose of such discussions. The parties
took that opportunity; however, they were not able to reach a final agreement.
they proposed that I should proceed to make the order in relation to
the return of the disputed sum, but on the basis that their
negotiations would
be ongoing and that the need for a compensation application by the landlords
could hopefully be avoided.
therefore order that the landlords pay to the tenants the sum of $840.50 by way
of return of part of the security deposit, such
payment to be made no later than
close of business Wednesday, 20 May 2015.
Dated this Wednesday, 13 May 2015
Richard Bruxner
Delegate of the
Commissioner of Tenancies
