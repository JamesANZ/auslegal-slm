This article examines accountability logics in two prominent regulatory
interventions designed to integrate sustainability into corporate
frameworks: sustainable finance and mandatory human rights and environmental due
diligence. Having emerged in Europe,
these interventions are now being
considered and/or introduced in other jurisdictions, including Australia, as
part of policy responses
to global sustainability challenges such as climate
change, biodiversity loss and human rights abuses in supply chains. Analysing
these reforms through an accountability lens helps capture relationships and
power dynamics that may otherwise be overlooked or under-appreciated
contributes to understandings of the likely impacts of these reforms. It also
complementarities between
these two interventions, as well as variations in their design and
implementation, which can inform law
and policymaking processes. Drawing on
early experiences in Europe, this article offers insights to inform the nature
and trajectory
of Australia’s nascent corporate sustainability
I INTRODUCTION
Integrating sustainability into corporate governance frameworks is widely
seen to be an essential step in the transition to a sustainable,
and there is considerable
global law and policy reform momentum directed to this end. In the Global North
in particular, two distinct
but related regulatory approaches have gained
prominence: sustainable finance reforms which seek to manage
sustainability-related
financial risks to business and align private capital
flows to address global sustainability challenges such as climate change,
biodiversity
loss and social inequity; and human rights and environmental due
diligence (‘HREDD’) which seeks to ensure large companies
to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse impacts on people and the environment
arising from their own activities, the
activities of subsidiaries and within
supply chains.
The European Union (‘EU’) is at the forefront of these corporate
sustainability governance reforms. It has implemented
a raft of ambitious
sustainable finance initiatives, including corporate sustainability reporting
and a sustainable finance taxonomy
designed to support the allocation of private
capital to sustainable business
activities.
Following the
introduction of mandatory HREDD (‘mHREDD’) in a handful of European
the EU has also
recently adopted the
that requires member states to establish,
monitor and enforce corporate HREDD
obligations.
Australia too has
begun to take steps to better align the interests of companies and their
shareholders with the environment and
society. It has initiated its own
sustainable finance agenda directed at improving the management of financial
risks posed to business
entities by climate change and aligning private capital
to the goals of the international
The Australian
Government has yet to embrace other elements of the EU’s corporate
sustainability project, including mHREDD.
However, there are rising calls from
civil society for it to do so.
These developments reflect evolving societal debates about corporate
accountability for social and environmental harms – more
specifically, the
extent to which, and how, national lawmakers and policymakers should intervene
to shape corporate responses to
global environmental and social challenges. Both
sustainable finance and mHREDD are directed at reorienting corporate
decision-making
towards more socially and environmentally responsible behaviour.
Yet to date, examination of the two regulatory approaches has tended
to play out
in different bodies of academic literature and different areas of policy and
Sustainable finance has
been an object of debate and analysis in the climate law and regulation
literature,
and in the context of
critical corporate law and
governance.
On the other hand,
HREDD has largely been discussed within business and human

regulation and governance
literature.
This article seeks to bridge this different literature and, in so doing,
contribute new perspectives to law, policymaking and scholarship
on corporate
sustainability governance. It also seeks to contextualise and evaluate

project in light of European
developments. It does this by examining how sustainable finance and mHREDD

corporate accountability for social and
environmental harms. This is important for several reasons.
First and most simply, the absence of sufficient accountability of corporate
actors for harmful environmental and social impacts is
widely identified as a
key contributor to global environmental and social problems like climate change,
biodiversity loss and human
rights abuses in international supply
National climate and
environmental law and human rights protection regimes struggle to effectively

through which to hold companies to account
for the negative impacts caused by
their subsidiaries or suppliers in other
The language of
‘accountability’
featured increasingly prominently in calls for sustainability governance reforms
both within Australia and
In this context,
sustainable finance (and to a lesser extent, mHREDD) appear to have captured the
attention of lawmakers and policymakers
as they constitute relatively
politically palatable approaches that steer, rather than constrain, the exercise
of corporate power.
These approaches are also seen as largely compatible with
economic objectives.
Second, accountability is a helpful analytical lens through which to capture
relationships and power dynamics that may otherwise be
overlooked or
under-appreciated when undertaking legal and policy analysis of these types of
reforms, but which are critical in understanding
their potential contribution to
achieving sustainability objectives. For example, sustainable finance reforms
build on well-established
accountability mechanisms housed in corporate law,
intended to protect the financial interests of shareholders and other market
participants,
and to foster stable and efficient markets. Yet depending on their
design, these reforms can also prompt companies to address the
environmental impacts of their direct operations and value chains as part of
their risk management. They can also open
pathways to allocate forward-looking
responsibility to business entities to contribute their fair share to
society’s response
to climate change and other sustainability challenges
in line with global goals.
contrast, HREDD focuses on preventing and minimising social and environmental
harms caused, or contributed to, by businesses through
their supply chains. As
such, business entities are potentially accountable not only to shareholders and
other market participants,
but to a diverse body of stakeholders including those
in other jurisdictions. While mHREDD laws are intended to incentivise the
and minimisation of future harms, they can also provide
accountability mechanisms to redress actual harms, including via civil liability
claims for victims. Initial steps have been taken to consider corporate
accountability dynamics inherent in
and sustainable
However, as these
reforms take shape and gain prominence, their underpinning assumptions deserve
further interrogation.
Finally, from a practical perspective, using an accountability lens helps to
uncover the differences, the convergences and the potential
complementarity
between sustainable finance reforms and mHREDD, as well as different approaches
to their design and implementation
which can inform future lawmaking and
policymaking in this area. As noted above, with a few exceptions, discussions of
these interventions
have tended to run on parallel tracks. We argue that there
is value in analysing these interventions in tandem, as complementary
related parts of a multifaceted strategy to strengthen corporate sustainability
governance. To this end, given recent European
leadership on both regulatory
fronts, there is also an opportunity to draw on European approaches to inform
ongoing developments
in Australia.
This article is organised in six Parts. Part II introduces the conceptual
lens that will be used to analyse sustainable finance and
mHREDD, which
considers how accountability relationships are scoped and allocated, and how
accountability is secured through the
articulation of standards and their
enforcement. Parts III and IV explore the key instruments and regulatory
approaches within sustainable
finance reforms and HREDD laws and their
underpinning theories of change, as implemented in the EU and Australia. The
intent is to
provide a macro-scale overview as a foundation for applying the
corporate accountability lens in Part V to identify strengths, weaknesses
key areas of convergence and divergence between sustainable finance and mHREDD.
Drawing on Europe’s experience to date,
we highlight measures which could
strengthen Australia’s nascent corporate sustainability project. In Part
VI, we offer concluding
observations as to the interaction and complementarity
of sustainable finance and mHREDD as regulatory interventions to strengthen
corporate sustainability governance.
II CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY IN SUSTAINABILITY
Before proceeding to explore the corporate accountability dynamics inherent
in sustainable finance and mHREDD, it is necessary to
distil some foundational
concepts associated with accountability. At its core, the term denotes a moral
or institutional relationship
between different actors, in which one actor or
group of actors (commonly referred to as ‘power wielders’) has an
to explain and justify its conduct, and another actor or group of
actors (commonly referred to as ‘accountability holders’)
power or authority to pose questions, pass judgement and impose
consequences.
Accountability
mechanisms are ostensibly designed for the protection and advancement of the
interests of certain groups (commonly
referred to as
‘beneficiaries’) or to meet related policy objectives. The
beneficiaries of an accountability mechanism
are often primary accountability
holders. However other actors (for example, regulators and civil society) may
also be empowered
to hold power wielders to account on behalf of purported
beneficiaries. This latter type of accountability holders are referred to
Mathias Koenig-Archibugi and Kate Macdonald as ‘proxies’ or
‘surrogate accountability’
Accountability can be understood as a normative concept and as a social
As a normative
concept, it is used to evaluate actors’ behaviour, with being answerable
for those behaviours seen as a desirable
outcome and virtue. As a social
mechanism, accountability refers to the institutional arrangements through which
one actor is held
accountable to others for their decisions and actions.
Accountability mechanisms can take different forms and involve public and
private actors in different
In a corporate
sustainability context:
• supervisory accountability mechanisms may involve state agencies
overseeing the risk management activities of companies;
• fiscal accountability mechanisms may tie public funds to certain
social and environmental standards;
• legal accountability mechanisms establish formal rules for corporate
behaviour, with sanctions for breach, and may include
liability for adverse
social and environmental impacts;
• market accountability mechanisms involve market participants such as
investors making capital allocation or stewardship decisions
based on corporate
sustainability performance; and
• reputational accountability mechanisms involve civil society and
other actors exerting pressure on company behaviour through
public advocacy and
other strategies.
Elucidating accountability relationships and dynamics in specific contexts
can be challenging. Accountability norms infuse, and indeed
may drive, many
regulatory interventions. Yet, law and policymakers often do not directly use
accountability frames or language,
thus leaving it open to interpretation as to,
for example, who is accountable to whom and for what, and/or who (or what) is
to be the ultimate beneficiary of the intervention. It is also the case
that accountability categories and terms are fluid and do
not neatly map onto

III SUSTAINABLE FINANCE REFORMS
A International Developments in Sustainable
Sustainable finance agendas have emerged internationally as a package of
reforms targeting two overarching objectives: managing the
financial risks posed
to companies and other market actors from climate change, biodiversity loss and
other sustainability issues;
and aligning private capital with relevant
international sustainability goals to help manage the broader systemic risks
these problems. As such, these reform agendas typically reference the
goals of the international
Paris Agreement
: to hold global warming to
well below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures and pursue efforts to
limit temperature rise to
no more than 1.5°C so as to significantly reduce
the risks and impacts of climate
and to achieve net-zero
emissions globally by 2050.
Increasingly, they also reference other key international instruments such as
Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
(negotiated under
the international
Convention on Biological Diversity
), through which
nation states have committed inter alia to halt species extinctions to ensure at
least 30% of terrestrial, inland
water and coastal and marine ecosystems are
effectively conserved and managed, and at least 30% of degraded systems are
under effective
restoration.
While social sustainability issues like inequality, inclusiveness, labour
relations and human rights are certainly covered in sustainable
measures, these tend to be less developed or less prominent than environmental
The core measures within sustainable finance reforms are directed at
enhancing transparency and market accountability. They build
on underlying and
well-established mechanisms of corporate law – namely risk disclosure
obligations and the fiduciary duties
of company directors – which serve to
hold companies and their directors legally accountable to select market
stakeholders
for the robust and transparent management of material financial
risks to company interests. The underpinning theory of change is
clarifying the financial materiality of sustainability risks and enhancing
transparency about corporate risk exposure and
management, companies will be
incentivised to implement robust risk management practices internally, and
market stakeholders –
particularly investors – can allocate private
capital to companies which undertake their business activities in line with
global and national sustainability goals. This, in turn, should help to
shift business practices away from socially and environmentally
activities and harness private sector resources to help address climate change,
biodiversity loss and other sustainability
challenges.
Introduced in 2021, the EU’s sustainable finance
represents the first
comprehensive, and in many ways, the most ambitious globally, sustainable
finance agenda. The EU reform package,
which has been developed alongside the
mHREDD framework (discussed further in

to enforcement action.
(b) Directors’ Duties

activities,
and their decisions
can have profound consequences not only for shareholders, employees and
creditors, but for broader
Corporations Act
sets out the legal duties that apply to their office, powers and functions,
including a duty for directors to exercise their powers
with due care and
as well as to act in
good faith in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper
These fiduciary duties do not explicitly require directors to prevent or
otherwise address adverse social and environmental impacts
associated with their
business activities. The duty of care and diligence requires directors to be
adequately informed of foreseeable
risks to their company and to take reasonable
steps to address these risks.
Although not tested in court, there is broad consensus that as part of this
duty, directors must inform themselves of how risks to
the company stemming from
climate change could
materialise.
Similar consensus
is developing around directors’ duties to inform themselves of the risks
posed by biodiversity loss.
Where these sustainability risks are deemed material (due to shareholder
expectations, physical impacts or potential reputational
risks, or as a result
of emerging policy and regulatory developments which restrict harmful
practices), the duty of care and diligence
may warrant that directors take steps
to manage the effect of those risks on the
Importantly, this does
not compel directors to take specific actions to address these risks (such as
reducing emissions or preventing
adverse impacts on nature). Instead, directors
are afforded considerable discretion in their response and can potentially

difficulties of alleviating social and environmental harms, or any
conflicting
responsibilities they owe, including the best interests
At law, the best interests of the company has been held to mean the best
interests of the shareholders as a general
However, courts have also
recognised that the company’s best interests can be broader than the
interests of shareholders. For
example, when a company is insolvent or sliding
into insolvency, the interests of creditors, not shareholders, are relevant to
determining
its best interests.
Further, directors are permitted (and may be advised) to consider the interests
of non-shareholder stakeholders and related social
and environmental
considerations, if this is undertaken in the context of acting in the
company’s long term interests, including
with a view of avoiding
reputational harm.

duties claims in the UK. In 2023, public interest law firm, ClientEarth,
acquired shares in major oil and gas company, Shell, and
filed a derivative
action against the company board for breach of directors’ duties.
ClientEarth argued that the board had
failed to adopt a credible climate
transition strategy in line with the international
Paris Agreement

diligence in the best interests of the company

The claim specified that
Shell’s ongoing allocation of capital to new oil and gas projects, as well
as high reliance (and lack
of transparency) on controversial strategies such as
carbon capture and storage and carbon offsets, did not establish a reasonable
basis for achieving its long term net-zero climate
The UK High Court
dismissed the case on the grounds that, regardless of whether the strategy was
unreasonable, Shell had a plan to
manage climate-related risks and it is
ultimately for the company directors to consider and promote what is in the best
of the company and its shareholders as a
Important to the
Court’s reasoning was the fact that ClientEarth was a minority
shareholder, holding only 27 shares in Shell,
and that the majority of members
had supported the directors’ strategic approach to climate change risk at
recent annual meetings.
The case between ClientEarth and Shell represents an attempt to use
directors’ duties to allocate forward-looking responsibility
to a company
to align their business activities with global climate change goals. Yet the
outcome underscores that, within corporate
law, directors are granted
considerable discretion to determine how to manage financial risks posed by
climate change in the best
interests of the company. It also suggests that
prevailing interpretations of directors’ duties prioritise the
shorter-term,
profit-focused interests of current shareholders above the
interests of non-shareholder stakeholders and indeed longer-term or even
shareholders.
Sustainable Finance: New
Transparency Measures
As outlined above, Australia’s existing corporate law framework does
not inherently restrict companies from proactively mitigating
adverse social and
environmental impacts. Yet the way that corporate accountability is scoped with
reference to financial risks to
the company, and the way in which it is
allocated and realised (with companies and their directors principally
accountable to shareholders
for robust management of material financial risks),
does not create strong incentives for companies to do so. We turn now to
whether and how Australia’s proposed sustainable finance reforms
might strengthen these incentives, drawing comparisons to
the EU regulatory
approach as relevant.
(a) Mandatory Climate Risk Disclosure
Mandatory climate risk disclosure is the most developed of the proposed new
transparency measures set out in Australia’s sustainable
finance strategy.
The reform aims to deliver clearer and comparable information to investors on
companies’ climate-related
financial risks so that they can make informed
decisions about the prospects and the resilience of investee

management, and to report comprehensively on their greenhouse gas
The introduction of mandatory standards is an important step to address
persistent problems with the quality and comparability of
climate risk
reporting. Yet the Australian approach, with its focus on financially material
risks at the entity scale, does not markedly
change the current legal position
in terms of corporate accountability for social and environmental harms (the
limits of which have
been noted above). In contrast, the approach taken to
sustainability reporting under EU sustainable finance reforms explicitly moves
beyond the reporting of financial risk at the entity scale. The EU’s

issues, but also
the material
of company activities on people or
the environment. These include impacts directly caused or contributed to by the
company in its
own operations, products, or services, as well as impacts which
are otherwise directly linked to the company’s upstream and
value chain.
(b) Climate Transition Planning

resilience to the

forward-looking climate risks and impacts.

disclosure of climate transition plans. Rather, it foreshadows

recommended.
(c) Sustainable Finance Taxonomy and Investment
Product Labelling
Sustainable finance taxonomies are classification schemes intended to support
investors and broader stakeholders to understand whether
economic activities
undertaken by a company are environmentally and socially
sustainable.
activities are categorised according to their contribution to relevant
environmental or social objectives, typically referencing
and other relevant international sustainability instruments. The
rationale is to direct investment capital towards economic activities
substantially contribute to climate change mitigation and other sustainability
objectives. Investment product labelling complements
and operationalises this
classification by setting out rules to substantiate claims that financial
products are sustainable with
reference to taxonomy categories.
The development of an Australian taxonomy is being coordinated by a
government-supported industry alliance – the Australian
Sustainable
Finance Institute (‘ASFI’) – and has also taken a
climate-first approach. The immediate focus is to
set out credible definitions
of ‘green’ or ‘transition’ business
activities.
Over time, ASFI
intends to move beyond climate change and incorporate broader environmental and
social criteria including in relation
• environmental management, ie, protection and restoration of healthy
ecosystems, sustainable use and protection of water, and
pollution prevention
and control;
• resource resilience;
• the circular economy transition; and
• social objectives, eg, First Nations rights, participation and
reconciliation.
Use of Australia’s taxonomy will be voluntary for investors and
companies once finalised.
In contrast, the EU taxonomy is mandatory and supported by targeted reporting
obligations. Companies that are required to report under

‘sustainable’ economic activities (as set
out in the taxonomy) as

Compared to the EU reforms, the transparency measures set out in
Australia’s sustainable finance agenda are relatively weak.
The Australian
reforms maintain a narrow focus on financial risks posed to the company, rather
than requiring reporting of company
impacts on social and environmental matters,
and alignment of company risk management to global goals. Sustainability

International Developments in
MHREDD is intended to secure greater corporate accountability for social and
environmental harms. The regulatory approach has its
roots in the concept of
human rights due diligence (‘HRDD’) set out in the United Nations
(‘UN’) Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights
UNGPs, endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, purport to clarify the
respective roles of states and businesses with
respect to corporate-related
human rights harms and constitute an authoritative international statement of
the global standard of
conduct for all businesses. According to the UNGPs, all
business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights, which

responsibility, all businesses should have in place a policy commitment to meet
their responsibility to respect human
rights; a HRDD process to identify,

negative impacts
on human rights; and processes to enable the remediation of
adverse human rights impacts they cause or to which they
contribute.
In the UNGPs, HRDD involves companies considering their actual and potential
adverse impacts on internationally recognised human rights.
These include, at a
minimum, those rights recognised in the International Bill of Human Rights and
ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and Its

Responsible Business Conduct (‘OECD

recently revised to integrate ‘risk-based due diligence’ throughout,

Both the UNGPs and the OECD Guidelines frame corporate due diligence on
social (and environmental) matters in global supply chains
as state and societal

unsuccessful, with plaintiffs facing significant legal, procedural

has meant that corporate accountability remains subject to the vagaries and
limitations of market-based forms of

To date, the Australian Government’s engagement with HREDD has been
tentative and piecemeal. These efforts include promotion
of the OECD Guidelines,
and the adoption of two pieces of legislation that draw on HREDD to regulate
discrete issues in transnational
supply chains.

adherence to any resulting NCP decision, remains voluntary.
Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012

businesses to adopt certain due diligence procedures before importing

discussion below is summarised in Table 1.
A Scoping Accountability Relationships
There are notable differences in the way that accountability relationships
are scoped within sustainable finance and mHREDD, which
relate to (i) the actors
involved; (ii) the substantive matters to which accountability is attached; and
(iii) the temporal direction
of the accountability relationship.
In terms of actors involved, sustainable finance measures do not depart
markedly from underlying accountability relationships set
out in corporate law,
whereby companies and their directors are accountable principally to
shareholders for the robust management
of material financial risks to the
business, and shareholders have powers to hold companies and directors
accountable.
By clarifying
the financial materiality of sustainability risks and setting standards for
reporting on these risks, sustainable finance
reforms reinforce the relevance of
social and environmental considerations for companies and their directors.
Public disclosure also,
to some degree at least, empowers other actors (such as
NGOs and consumers) to hold companies to account. Nonetheless, these reforms
not clearly position people and the environment as primary accountability
holders, nor provide novel channels through which these
actors may pursue
greater corporate accountability. Rather, they rely heavily on investors to
drive improved social and environmental
performance by companies (the risks of
which are discussed further below in the context of securing accountability).
Within this
regime, corporate regulators as accountability holders also have
powers to enforce legal obligations to disclose sustainability risks

environmental harms has however been criticised as overly narrow and
human-focused, with its reference to a small set of
international environmental
agreements and environmental harms that impair human rights or substantially
affect ecosystem services
that contribute to human
The temporal elements of the accountability relationships within sustainable
finance and mHREDD are also divergent. Sustainable finance
reforms, particularly
where they encompass mandatory transition planning aligned to global goals, are
essentially forward-looking.
They seek to embed some level of prospective
responsibility to companies to contribute to addressing social and environmental
in line with global goals. MHREDD, in contrast, imposes responsibilities
on companies that are both prospective (through the requirement
for proactive
due diligence) and remedial in nature. By enabling companies to be held to
account for failure to prevent causing or
contributing to harm to people and the
environment, and for failure to remediate harms, mHREDD also incorporates a more
retrospective
accountability. When it comes to climate change, however, the EU
adopts a forward-looking only approach (mandatory climate
transition plans) that does not grapple with the complexity and political
barriers to attributing historical corporate responsibility for climate change
B Standards for Accountability
Considering the standards by which the accountability of corporate actors is
to be judged is critical to understanding the potential
effect of sustainable
finance and mHREDD. Sustainable finance reforms are based on well-established
expectations or standards of
conduct for companies and their directors which
derive from corporations law. As discussed in Part III in an Australian context,
these are based on the concept of
materiality
which informs risk
disclosure and management
obligations,
the concept of
best interests of the company
which underpins directors’
and standards of
reasonableness
which guide the exercise of discretion by company
directors to undertake appropriate risk management to protect these interests,

These operate as
principles-based standards of conduct, intended to guide robust risk management
and decision-making, rather than
standards of

the financial materiality of
these risks increases, what is considered
reasonable and what is in a company’s best interests is also shifting. Yet
UK litigation illustrates in Part III above, company directors are
granted considerable discretion in determining appropriate responses
climate-related risks. Indeed, the outcome in the Shell case suggests that in
the near to medium term, corporate law standards
may serve to legitimise the
continued corporate pursuit of climate-damaging activities such as fossil fuel
extraction – despite
their contribution to broader systemic risks posed by
climate change – as long as the financial risks to the company associated
with these activities can be appropriately managed (eg, through sufficient
diversification of business activities and investment
in developing alternatives
over time).
While Australian sustainable finance reforms do not depart significantly from
these underlying standards, the EU sustainable finance
agenda has strengthened
them in important ways. For example, the EU’s
double materiality
standard explicitly requires reporting not only on sustainability risks to
company interests, but also on a company’s social
and environmental
This is important as
the adverse impacts of a company’s activities contribute to systemic risks
posed by climate change and
biodiversity loss, but do not always lead to
material financial risks to the company’s business (at least in the
short-medium
term) and can therefore be overlooked and ignored within the strict
financial materiality lens. Financial materiality at the entity
scale depends on
how these impacts are regulated and treated by the market and the relevance of
physical impacts of climate change
and biodiversity loss to a company’s
operations (eg, extreme climate events, loss of pollinator species associated
with biodiversity
loss, or decline in water quality associated with
deforestation). However, as these problems worsen, these systemic risks will

companies, both through physical impacts on supply chains and operations,
through the evolving regulatory and market responses to these issues which
(should be expected to) further constrain business
practices with harmful
impacts. The
double materiality
standard acknowledges this complex
relationship between risks and impacts at different scales and over different
timeframes, even
though it does not direct companies on how adverse impacts
should be mitigated.
Within reporting standards and transition planning requirements, the EU
reforms also incorporate stronger requirements for companies
to align their risk
management with international sustainability goals such as those set out in the
Paris Agreement
has the effect of shifting the standard of behaviour expected beyond a narrow
focus on managing financial risks posed by sustainability
issues at the entity
scale, to also address the way in which individual entities contribute to
managing systemic, economy-wide risks
posed by climate change, biodiversity loss
and other sustainability challenges. These types of requirements may therefore
build towards more forward-looking accountability for companies to
reduce their adverse social and environmental impacts in line
with global goals.
Drawing on international standards of responsible business conduct and
innovative regulatory initiatives in the EU, the

significant elevation of the minimum standards of due diligence expected of
large businesses when it comes to identifying
and responding to their actual and
potential adverse impacts on human rights and the environment. This is

into the conceptual framework

the information disclosed by companies
will empower investors, consumers and
civil society to make informed decisions as to where to invest or purchase and,
where necessary,
to ‘sanction’ certain companies by refraining from
doing so, thereby contributing to improved corporate social and environmental
sustainability.
This reliance on information disclosure as a regulatory tool is consistent
with, and indeed a manifestation of, a broader ‘transparency
in sustainability governance.
However, there is considerable evidence suggesting that the relationship between
transparency and accountability is more complex
than often presumed by
policymakers, and that while transparency may be a necessary condition for
accountability, it is rarely sufficient
on its own to achieve this objective.
For example, while such disclosure schemes may reduce informational asymmetries
and thus increase
the answerability of power wielders to accountability holders,
there is little evidence to suggest that this alone is capable of

VI CONCLUSION
This article has juxtaposed, considered and compared sustainable finance and
mHREDD as two distinct but increasingly prominent regulatory
approaches to
integrate sustainability into corporate governance. By exploring the
accountability logics in the two approaches, it
sought to provide insight into
their potential and their limitations to enhance corporate social and
environmental accountability
as part of societal responses to climate change,
biodiversity loss and human rights abuses in international supply chains.
on European experiences to date, it also considered opportunities to
strengthen Australia’s nascent corporate sustainability
Australian sustainable finance reforms, as currently proposed, only minimally
depart from the existing accountability relationships,
standards and processes
embedded in corporations law. While these increasingly require some integration
of sustainability issues
in corporate governance, the way that corporate
accountability is scoped with reference to financial risks to the company, and
way in which it is allocated and secured (with companies principally
accountable to shareholders), does not create strong incentives
for companies
and their directors to address social and environmental harms in a timely way.
Further, relying heavily on transparency
and market accountability, without also
addressing the mixed incentives of key accountability holders like institutional
is unlikely to drive the timely and comprehensive reallocation of
private capital away from harmful activities and towards more sustainable
activities envisaged by these reforms. The accountability relationships and
standards within the European sustainable finance initiative
appear to create
stronger incentives and a clearer realignment of corporate governance towards
sustainability goals. As Australia
moves forward with its reform agenda, there
are opportunities to strengthen this through explicit adoption of a
materiality
standard, comprehensive coverage of social and environmental
issues, mandatory corporate transition planning aligning company risk
with global goals, and mandatory reporting against the sustainable finance
HREDD laws like the
adopt richer and more diverse accountability
logics than sustainable finance. Indeed, this analysis suggests that mHREDD has
potential to deepen and broaden corporate accountability for social and
environmental harms beyond what is possible with sustainable
finance measures.
Of course, formal rules alone do not tell the whole story, and the capacity of
these laws to deliver significant
improvements in accountability remains to be
It is also the case, as
Michael Mason, Lena Partzsch and Teresa Kramarz emphasise, that ‘the devil
is in the detail’.
Questions of scope, application, the nature of due diligence duty, and
compliance and enforcement infrastructures are central to
determining the
capacity of such a law to contribute to meaningful change, and the way in which
such laws are designed will inevitably
reflect domestic political and
institutional environments, especially legacies in state-market relations.
However, in a world where
corporate accountability remains elusive, and
formulating effective regulatory interventions to address complex and
intertwined social
and environmental challenges that transcend national borders
remains challenging for policymakers, such laws merit serious consideration,
including in Australia.
While this analysis has focused largely on the accountability logics
sustainable finance and mHREDD (second-tier accountability), we
conclude with some broader reflection on first-tier accountability
sustainability governance, and particularly the relative prominence of these two
interventions in Australia and their framing
as viable solutions to global
sustainability challenges.
This article has confirmed that Australia’s nascent corporate
sustainability project is overwhelmingly relying on market-based
modalities of
accountability. Given the gravity and urgency of the problems that the
regulatory interventions are purporting to address
and the voluminous literature
suggesting that accountability through transparency alone is often incapable of
achieving the regulatory
objectives to which it is brought to
this trajectory is of
concern. A basic but important commonality between sustainable finance and
mHREDD is that both reflect and
align with, rather than interrogate, dominant
market-based logics and configurations of authority and
Neither involves
fundamental reforms to what are deeply unsustainable business models and
institutions.
sustainable finance, particularly when accompanied by mHREDD, can certainly help
to reorient business towards sustainability
objectives, we suggest that more

accountability logics –

The case also argued that
Shell’s targets and transition strategy were inconsistent with an order
issued by the Hague District
Court in the Netherlands against Royal Dutch Shell
in 2021 which required the company to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by
net 45% by 2030 across its own operations and Scope 3 emissions: ibid 3

ClientEarth May Oral Order
ClientEarth May Oral
(n 89) [68] (Trower J) notes that 88.4% of the votes cast by members
at the 2021 annual general meeting (‘AGM’) and 80%
at the 2022 AGM
were in support of the directors’ approach to climate change risk. These
factors suggested to the Court that
ClientEarth’s ‘real interest is
not in how best to promote the success of Shell for the benefit of its members
as a whole’:
at [65]. Instead, ‘it is that [membership] constituency
as a whole whose views should carry very considerable weight when determining
how Shell can best manage the climate change risk with these proceedings are
concerned’: at [69].
This is consistent with a
growing body of critical corporate law and governance scholarship that
highlights how current articulations
of directors’ duties incentivise
shareholder primacy and limit corporations from shifting to truly sustainable
business models.

€1.5 billion global turnover and
more than 5,000 employees from mid-2027,
and to EU companies with a global turnover of €450 million and more than
1,000 employees
by mid-2029.

and annex I, part I section 2, which lists the
international instruments from which those rights derive.

business partners) and other entities
which perform business operations related
to the operations, products or services of the company (indirect
partners): ibid art 3(1)(f).
Ibid art 3(1)(g). This
formulation is significantly narrower than provided in the
and ‘OECD Guidelines’ (n 122), under which businesses are expected
to conduct due diligence along their entire
value chains. It also has the effect
of significantly limiting the due diligence obligations on financial
undertakings as they are
not required to undertake due diligence on business
partners receiving their products and services.
Ibid art 9.
Ibid art 22(1). This
article makes clear that companies that report a transition plan for climate
change mitigation under the
(n 101) shall be deemed to have complied
’s (n 4) obligation to adopt such a plan. However,
companies are still obliged to put that transition plan into effect and to
update it every 12 months to assess progress made towards its targets.

superannuation trustees from pursuing environmental
and social objectives
without regard to financial performance: ‘Fiduciaries must not too readily
treat ESG factors as economically
relevant to the particular investment choices
at issue when making a decision.’ While this view is not inconsistent with
law, the direction to avoid readily equating environmental and social
factors to financial performance arguably sends a signal that
investors should
precisely quantify the financial impacts of a sustainability risk to an
individual stock, rather than pursuing sustainability
outcomes based on the
investment thesis that systemic risks threaten financial performance across
diversified portfolios.
