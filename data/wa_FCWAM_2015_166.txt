THE ORIGINAL JUDGMENT - PARTIES’ NAMES AND IDENTIFYING DETAILS HAVE BEEN
1 This matter was previously
before me in a Bunbury circuit for a conciliation conference on 28 May 2015.
Given the parties intended
to raise issues and file and serve documents
requiring a hearing, the matter was adjourned to a hearing before me in Perth on
2015. The hearing proceeded on that date and I reserved my judgment
to be delivered on 4 August 2015.
Background of the parties
2 The father works on a two week on/two week off then two week on/four weeks
off FIFO roster. The parties started living together
in 2008. They have two
children, [Child A] born [in] 2009 and [Child B] born [in] 2012.
3 They separated on 20 January 2012. The children initially lived with the
mother. The father removed the children from the mother’s
care on 28 July
2013, given his concerns that they were being subjected to child abuse and
family violence in her care.
4 The previous orders made on 4 August 2014 provide for the children to
spend time with the mother each Monday from 9.00 am to Tuesday
and six hours on one other day during the week. Further orders were made in
November 2014 which allowed the children to
spend time with the mother when the
father was at work. The children therefore have been spending extended periods
in the mother’s
care when the father was working away for two weeks at a
5 Since November 2014, the children have enjoyed a sharedcare regime where
they live with the father when he is not at work and with
the mother when he is
6 The Court is required to determine the interim application and response of
the parties. The father filed a Form 2 application
on 27 May 2015 and in that
application sought the following orders on an interim basis:

the applicant is home for more than two consecutive weeks, then the respondent
shall spend time with the children each alternate
fortnight during that period.
the applicant is at work, the respondent shall spend time with the children
until the applicant returns.
Father’s case
8 The father says that the Court should act protectively to provide for
supervised time between the mother and the children and should
also ensure that
an Independent Children’s Lawyer is appointed and then review the ongoing
interim arrangements once the Independent
Children’s Lawyer has had an
opportunity to conduct some investigations.
9 Counsel for the father submitted that the main concerns of the father were
outlined in his affidavit at paragraphs 20, 29 and 33.
These paragraphs relate
to the concerning information received from a [Ms M] (details will be discussed
shortly) and from a [Mr
N] (details to be discussed) and from the owner of the
[Coastal Town M Caravan and Holiday Park] (details to be discussed).
Information
set out in those paragraphs and corroborated by the affidavit of [Ms
M] provide ample reasons as to why the father retained the children
in his care
recently. Given that the orders provide that the children spend time with the
mother when the father is working, he
has recently decided to cease working in
order to not breach the current orders. I therefore reserved my judgment to as
date as possible to allow the father to return to work and for the
children to return to a proper routine.
10 The father submits that the mother’s response material attacks the
witnesses or some of them, but does not specifically
deny the detailed
allegations made (with one or two exceptions). There are certainly some denials
contained in the mother’s
11 There are many concerning elements of the evidence before the Court.
The father’s actions (as mentioned) were prompted
by information
received from three other people. The Court may question the veracity of some
of that information given that some
of it is from a former best friend. There
may well be some reason as to why witnesses give certain evidence other than
because the
evidence is entirely accurate, but at this stage no proper
explanation has been offered by the mother as to why these people might
saying things that are not true.
12 The Court acknowledges that on an interim basis it is difficult to make
determinations of factual issues when those facts are
disputed. That is, unless
there is some reasonable corroborative evidence of those facts. In this case
there is some independent
evidence provided by the witnesses.
Mother’s case
13 In essence, the mother says that:
(a) the previous arrangements were working well;
(b) the father had no issue with those arrangements until various people
relayed information to him;
(c) that the information provided to him is either denied, unreliable or
patently false;
(d) she acknowledges having a history of mental health issues, but appears to
blame them (at least in part) on the father’s
behaviour and his attitude
towards her;
(e) that she has a good and loving relationship with the children and takes
good care of them;
(f) that she acknowledges ongoing marijuana use, but denies any impact on her
parenting and otherwise denies excessive alcohol consumption.
The evidence
14 By way of background, on 19 May 2014 the Department for Child Protection
and Family Support provided a letter in response to the
father’s Form 4
notice. In that the mother acknowledged her previous methamphetamine use. The
Department found that if she
was using methamphetamines again the children would
be at risk of harm. The Department recommended that the mother’s drug
be determined before altering the current arrangements.
15 In more recent times:
(a) on 6 May 2015 the father received a phone call from a friend who relayed
information she had been told about the mother from [Ms
M]. The father then
spoke to [Ms M] who confirmed at [20] of the father’s affidavit that:
had received text messages from [Ms Ormonde] stating “I should not be
a mother”; “I can’t do this anymore”;
“I’m losing it”;
had personally seen [Ms Ormonde] smoking methamphetamine;
regularly sees [Ms Ormonde] smoke marijuana in the presence of [Child A] and
[Child B], sometimes in her caravan with the door
and windows closed;
had received text messages from [Ms Ormonde] in which she stated she did not
want to undergo a drug urinalysis test as requested
by me as she would
“lose the girls”;
regularly sees [Ms Ormonde] drink excessive amounts of alcohol while [Child A]
and [Child B] are in her care;
Ormonde] allows [Child A] and [Child B] to roam around the [Coastal Town M
Caravan Park] unsupervised for extended periods of
Ormonde] regularly asks her to wash and iron [Child A] and [Child B’s]
clothes, take [Child A] to and from school and babysit
Child A and Child B
(sometimes overnight); and
Ormonde] frequently asks her for money.
16 Ms M filed an affidavit
in these proceedings confirming the above evidence.
17 On 12 May 2015 Ms M told the father (at [22] of the father’s
affidavit):
That [Ms Ormonde] had called her that morning and asked her to take [Child A]
to school. [Ms M] informed me that when she arrived
at [Ms Ormonde’s]
caravan to collect [Child A], [Ms Ormonde] was “losing it”, was
curled in a ball on the floor
and kept stating she “wants to die”
and she “can’t do this”. [Ms M] informed me that both [Child
and [Child B] were present and were very distressed by [Ms Ormonde’s]
behaviour. [Ms M] said that she proceeded to take [Child
A] to school, as
requested by [Ms Ormonde], however, she was unable to take [Child B] to
day-care as the day-care do not know [Ms
M] and [Ms M] does not have the
required authorisation.
18 Given that the mother’s drug use is a significant issue, drug
urinalysis testing has been ordered. On 10 May 2015 the father
requested a
test; the mother did not attend. Ms M received texts from the mother on 11
May 2015 saying, “I can’t have
that in my wee or I’ll lose the
girls”. The mother has previously failed to provide clean test results.
four such tests in February, March, June and August 2014.
19 On 15 May 2015 the father received a call from the owner of the caravan
park at which the mother resides. The concerns raised
by that person were
(see [33] of the father’s affidavit), namely:
(b) she had seen [Child A] and [Child B] wandering around the caravan park by
themselves;
(c) [Ms Ormonde] has been spending time with well-known drug users at the
caravan park; and
(d) [Ms Ormonde] asked the owner of the caravan park for nappies and milk as
she had no money.
20 On 17 May 2015 the father received information from a Mr N who owned the
property in which the mother had lived with the children
(in a granny flat). He
evicted her in March 2015 because of the following concerns (set out at [29] of
the father’s affidavit):
(a) He often overheard [Ms Ormonde] trying to source drugs on the phone;
(b) He saw a well-known drug dealer come to the house looking for [Ms
Ormonde], however [Ms Ormonde] hid;
(c) His neighbours had contacted the police on a number of occasions due to
[Ms Ormonde’s] disturbing behaviour. For example,
[Ms Ormonde] smashed a
hole in a window at [Mr N’s] house. [Ms Ormonde] would also be up all
hours of the night playing loud
music. On both of these occasions, the children
were in her care; and
(d) [Ms Ormonde] was often behind in rent.
21 After being evicted from Mr N’s residence the mother moved to the
Coastal Town M Caravan Park.
22 Given the drug testing concerns, the father has proposed that the mother
undergo hair testing and that he pay the costs. In my
view, that is a sensible
suggestion.
23 Ms M’s affidavit goes well beyond the information initially
provided to the father. Whilst it is not necessary to set out
in full the
various allegations made, they are contained in paragraphs [13], [16], [18],
[19], [21], [23], [24], [25], [18], [19],
[39], [41] and [43]. Most that relate
to text messages have been corroborated by providing the actual text messages.
In my view,
[23] is a particularly disturbing allegation that Ms M saw Ms
Ormonde use methamphetamine on 26 March 2015. She describes in detail
drug was taken and she notes that the children were not present.
24 The mother filed her affidavit on 2 July 2015. In it she said
(relevantly):
(a) At [2]: The history of this matter is that I had serious mental issues
and became involved with the wrong people in 2013 and
the applicant withheld the
children at that time.
(b) At [5]: I have always been a somewhat stranded United States citizen who
has suffered from a lack of family support due to distance
and separation.
(c) At [7]: The mental health issues I developed are constantly inflamed by
the belligerent and sometimes malicious behaviour. He
shows signs at times of
being on the verge of losing his temper physically and he harbours much angst
and self-loathing.
(d) At [19]: There have been criticisms within the affidavit materials [sic]
that I have seen of my parenting where it is said that
the children are
“running around the caravan park”. However, the caravans are in a
big loop formation and I so [sic]
allow the children a little freedom provided
that they do not go beyond my field of view.
(e) At [28]: I feel vilified within the town and I know full well that the
[Ellerys] have smeared and will continue to smear my name,
characterising me as
a junkie, a drug addict and a bad mother.
25 The mother answers the various allegations raised by Ms M by saying
that they used to be best friends; that they helped each other
Ms M had chronic mental health issues and illicit drug use issues that the
mother helped her with; and that Ms M takes
prescribed Dexamphetamine and
26 The mother said in relation to some of the texts such as “I
shouldn’t be a mother” that these were the kind
of insecure things
that each of them said to each other within the confines of a close friendship.
Interestingly, she flatly denies
at [61] Ms M’ allegation that she
saw the mother smoke methamphetamine and described it as “an outright
She says, “[Child A] has never witnessed me smoking
methamphetamine”. She does not dispute smoking methamphetamine in
times; just that Ms M did not see her do it.
27 At [62], she denied smoking marijuana in the presence of the children
although she concedes that she does smoke on a regular basis.
28 At [74] she claims that her use of marijuana was medically scripted.
Whilst not stating this, I accept counsel for the father’s
submission that
this must have been when she was living overseas. This is not possible in any
Australian jurisdiction.
29 The mother also relied upon a supportive affidavit of [Mr McB] who is a
close friend. Some of his evidence (as with some other
witnesses) contained
hearsay evidence which was of no evidentiary value. An example is him referring
to what is “known around
30 The upshot of the father’s actions in retaining the children in his
care is that the mother has not seen the children for
a period of 33 days up to
30 June 2015 when the mother swore her affidavit. Since then a further five
weeks has passed to the date
these reasons will be delivered. That has had a
financial impact in relation to her parenting payments.
Conclusions in relation to the evidence
31 The mother’s evidence shows signs of a lack of maturity and
responsibility for her own actions. She blamed her mental health
issues partly
on the father’s behaviour. She also blamed her previous best friend for
getting her drunk. At [76] she blamed
her friend for putting vodka in her
drinks. She says, “I told her I couldn’t handle vodka, but she kept
putting it in”.
The other obvious option for the mother was to take
responsibility for herself and simply not drink the drinks put in front of her.
32 The mother does, however, acknowledge receiving ongoing cognitive
behavioural therapy and is working on coping strategies. The
mental health
practitioners assisting her have provided reports which were supportive and
positive. The mother provided a recent
drug test which was not random, but in
any event showed the presence of marijuana and benzodiazepines. It did not show
any methamphetamine.
Principals of law
33 Children’s proceedings are dealt with in
of the Act. In
deciding whether to make a parenting order, I must treat the best interests of
the child as the paramount consideration.
34 As the Full Court in
Goode & Goode
(2006) FLC 93-286 said at
In our view, it can be fairly said that there is a legislative intent evinced
in favour of substantial involvement of both parents
in their children’s
lives, both as to parental responsibility and as to time spent with the
children, subject to the need to
protect children from harm, from abuse and
family violence and provided it is in their best interests and reasonably
practicable.
This means where there is a status quo or well settled environment,
instead of simply preserving it, unless there are protective
significant best interests concerns for the child, the Court must follow the
structure of the Act and consider accepting,
where applicable, equal or
significant involvement by both parents in the care arrangements for the
35 As the High Court of Australia emphasised in
and as the Full Court reemphasised in
Cox v Pedrana
[2013] FamCAFC
the legislation (in
provides that when making a parenting order
in relation to a child, the Court must apply a presumption that it is in the
best interests
of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared
parental responsibility for the child.
Section 70A(2)
provides that:
the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe
that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a
parent of the child)
has engaged in-
(a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the
parent’s family (or that other person’s
family); or
(b) family violence.
Section 70A(4)
provides that:
the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the Court that it
would not be in the best interests of the child for the
child’s parents to
have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
38 The Court therefore clearly must apply the presumption unless it does not
apply pursuant to
or is rebutted pursuant to
39 I have also had regard to the objects of the Act and the principles which
underlie those objects. They provide the context in
which the above
considerations are to be examined and weighed. They are set out below.
Section 66(1)
(1) The objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of
children are met by:
(a) ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a
meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum
extent consistent with the
best interests of the child; and
(b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being
subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence;
(c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them
achieve their full potential; and
(d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their
responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their
Section 66(2)
(2) The principles underlying these objects are that (except when it is or
would be contrary to a child’s best interests):
(a) children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents,
regardless of whether their parents are married, separated,
have never married
or have never lived together; and
(b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and
communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other
significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and
other relatives); and
(c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care,
welfare and development of their children; and
(d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children; and
(e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to
enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).”
42 To assess what is in the child’s best interests, I must consider
the “primary” and “additional”
considerations set out in
Primary considerations
43 The primary considerations are:
(a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of
the child's parents; and
(b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from
being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family
The benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both
of the child's parents
44 It is clear that meaningful means a relationship that is important,
significant and valuable to the child. The Full Court in
[2009] FamCAFC 92
(2009) FLC 93-405
made this finding and set out what it considered to
be three possible interpretations of this subsection:
(a) One interpretation is that the legislation requires a Court to consider
the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship
with both of the
child’s parents by examination of evidence of the nature of the
child’s relationship at the date of
the hearing, to make findings based on
that evidence, which findings will be reflected in the orders ultimately made
present relationship approach”);
(b) a second interpretation is that the legislature intended that a Court
should assume that there is a benefit to all children in
a meaningful relationship with both of their parents (“the
presumption approach”); and
(c) the third interpretation is that the Court should consider and weigh the
evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how,
if it is in a
child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular
child has a meaningful relationship with
both parents (“the prospective
approach”).
45 The Full Court concluded that the prospective approach was preferred, but
depending on the circumstances of the case, the present
relationship approach
may also be relevant. The Court accepted that if only the present relationship
approach were followed, the
Court would be limited in making appropriate orders
in circumstances where a significant relationship had not been established
a child and a parent at the date of the trial.
46 I have no doubt that these children should enjoy a meaningful
relationship with both of their parents.
The need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from
being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family
47 Amendments were made to the definitions of family violence and abuse
which took effect in relation to all cases that commence
on or after 5 October
2013. This matter was commenced prior to that date so the previous version
of the definition of family violence
applies to this matter.
48 The definition of abuse that applies to this matter is as follows:
Abuse, in relation to a child, means:
(a) an assault, including a sexual assault, of the child which is an offence
under a law, written or unwritten, in force in the State
or Territory in which
the act constituting the assault occurs; or
(b) a person involving the child in a sexual activity with that person or
another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly,
as a sexual
object by the first mentioned person or the other person, and where there is
unequal power in the relationship between
the child and the first mentioned
Family violence is defined as:
Family violence means conduct, whether actual or threatened, by a person
towards, or towards the property of, a member of the person’s
family that
causes that or any other member of the person’s family reasonably to fear
for, or reasonably to be apprehensive
49 The note to that provision provides that “a person reasonably fears
for, or reasonably is apprehensive about, his or her
personal wellbeing in
particular circumstances if a reasonable person in those circumstances would
fear for, or be apprehensive about,
his or her personal wellbeing or
50 I am not satisfied that the recent allegations fall within the above
definitions or that there is any need to make orders that
will protect these
children from physical or psychological harm by being in the mother’s
Additional considerations
51 I propose to limit my discussion of these considerations to only those
factors that apply to this matter.
52 The children generally have a good relationship with both of their
parents and have been spending significant amounts of time
parent’s care until recently.
The likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances,
including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:
(i) either of his or her parents; or
(ii) any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or
other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living
53 In my view, the children are likely to be missing their mother having not
spent any time with her for a significant period. In
my view, there will be an
ongoing adverse effect on the children if that is to continue. I am not
satisfied that the limited supervision
proposed by the father would be
sufficient to alleviate that likely ongoing effect.
54 Each parent has shown that they are capable of caring for these children.
Despite the various allegations raised against the mother,
there is no evidence
of any actual harm to the children.
55 Before I make a significant change to the current orders, I must be
satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to cause the Court
concern about
some risk to the children in the mother’s care if the current orders were
to continue. Notwithstanding the general
denials by the mother, there is
clearly some disturbing evidence provided by the father and his witnesses. The
Court cannot ignore
that evidence on an interim basis even though some of it is
contested. The Court’s “main brief” is to ensure that
children are safe. This is in accordance with the abovementioned principles and
that when considering the primary considerations
the Court must give more weight
to the need to protect children rather than the need to maintain ongoing
meaningful relationships
with both parents.
Conclusions
56 When the Court carefully examines the numerous allegations made against
the mother and breaks them down, the following conclusions
are reached:
(a) None of the allegations relate to any actual harm to the children;
(b) None relate to any untoward behaviour directly to the children;
(c) They relate to expressions of self-doubt which the mother acknowledges
and is receiving treatment for;
(d) They relate to alleged drug use which is denied, but can be clarified by
hair testing;
(e) They relate to excessive alcohol consumption which is mostly denied;
(f) They relate to issues to do with rent payments and tenancy issues which
do not impact on the mother’s parenting.
57 On an interim basis the Court should be wary of acting on unsubstantiated
allegations which are denied, but must also balance
that risk with the need to
act protectively towards children.
58 In this case, I am not satisfied that all of the separate allegations add
up sufficiently to warrant a change in the current orders
on an interim basis.
My view is that the presumption that it is in the best interests of these
children for their parents to have
equal shared parental responsibility applies
and is not otherwise rebutted by the evidence. I must therefore consider equal
and substantial and significant time.
59 The mother’s drug use, or lack thereof, however, needs to be
verified. Hair testing is an appropriate vehicle to obtain
an historical
set of results. Ongoing hair testing should assist after the initial hair
test results are obtained.
60 I am not presently satisfied that the mother’s time needs to be
supervised. It is clear from the evidence provided by the
father that the
children are readily observable in the community, especially by people at the
Coastal Town M Caravan Park. There
may well be further information provided to
the father in the event that further concerns are raised about the
mother’s behaviour
or the children’s behaviour.
61 On an interim basis, there is no need to make orders regarding parental
responsibility. Whilst I understand the father’s
actions in retaining the
children given the concerns raised by others, in my view, the children should
immediately return to the
previous arrangements. The children need and will
benefit from ongoing care by both of their parents. The mother is clearly on
notice by the father’s actions and the children no doubt will be closely
monitored in the future.
62 I intend to reinstate the earlier arrangements. In my view, that
represents an appropriate amount of time and is a substantial
and significant
time arrangement. I will hear from counsel as to when the father will
will next be placed in the
mother’s care. In my view, that should occur soon.
