Edited by Garrick Professor Gabriël A Moens
and Dr Rodolphe Biffot,
The Convergence of Legal Systems in the
21st Century: An Australian Approach,
The modern study and practice of comparative law is to a large extent
recognised as having begun in 1900 at the International Congress
of Comparative
Law held in Paris. This was the beginning of a series of such
conferences—which are now quadrennial— with
the 16th Congress of the
International Academy of Comparative Law being held just over a century later,
in July 2002, at the University
of Queensland (hosted by the Australian
Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law, located in the TC Beirne School of
Law). In conjunction
with the conference, the principal organisers brought out
this edited compilation of articles compiled by leading Australian legal
In 1900, the conference
was an optimistic faith in progress,
a strong desire for mastery of one’s fate, and the forging of a common
destiny. The founders
talked of a common law of mankind, a world law created by
the comparative legal method. In 2002, the conference theme was
Convergence
of Legal Systems in the 21st Century,
and this compilation deals with the
Australian approach to this concept.
After a brief introduction by the editors, the book is sub-divided into
collections of articles on the topics of six of the main conference
E-commerce, Constitutional Law, Legal Philosophy and Theory, Criminal Law,
Commercial Law
Dispute Resolution
. While no book of practicable
length could be comprehensive in its choice of topics, this is an excellent
selection in covering most
of the main areas of legal knowledge, including those
where current developments are most active. There is no doubt that the book
and will remain a very valuable research tool.
In their introduction, the editors justify the choice of theme on the basis
of it being appropriate, at the commencement of a new
century, to reflect on the
similarities of the major legal systems of the world. They also furnish a very
useful short guide to the
contents of all the articles included. Although all
authors are Australian, only a few articles relate to matters of current or
controversy in Australia: notably Lynne Barnes’ article on
‘Sentencing’, which in large measure relates to the
issues raised by
particular provisions for mandatory sentencing in Western Australia and the
Northern Territory of Australia, which
have since been repealed following
changes of government. The only flaw in this otherwise comprehensive discussion
is that it completely
ignores the wide range of mandatory sentences imposed for
matters such as motoring offences. The article also discusses the issues
difficulties raised by guideline judgment legislation in New South Wales, and
mentions the recent imposition of minimum sentences
at federal level to combat
‘people smuggling’ in the wake of the late 2001 crisis precipitated
episode. It also touches upon the underlying
constitutional issues of separation of powers between the legislature and
In the other articles grouped under heading of ‘Criminal Law’,
Richard Refshauge furnishes an excellent account of the
history and practice of
prosecutorial discretion in Australia, making very interesting comparisons with
the United Kingdom, and the
other three articles involve constitutional and
international issues. Carolyn Evans has provided a very comprehensive account of
the law bearing on the criminal liability of ministers, governors and
governors-general in Australia, identifying such murky issues
as the uncertainty
over whether customary international law applies in Australia. The article
contributed by Alexis Goh and Steven
Freeland is complementary in that it
discusses the International Criminal Court established on 1 July 2002. It also
explicitly mentions
the tension between national sovereignty and international
law, which underlies most of the acute current legal and political
controversies.
Professor David Lanham has supplied a comprehensive account of
the use of Australian criminal law and its international offshoots
in fighting
corruption.
Also in the fields of constitutional and international law, John Trone is an
acknowledged expert on all aspects of the constitutional
treaty making powers of
the Government and Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. He has brought
his very considerable expertise
to bear in formulating a comprehensive analysis
of constitutions and treaty on contractual rights and freedoms. Simon Evans and
Donoghue have contributed a veritable tome on the issue of standing in
constitutional cases, including a discussion of the justiciability
matters as seeking to restrain a double dissolution of Parliament.
Jenni Whelan and Christine Fougere discuss ‘The Proscription of Hate
Speech in Australia’. It is a well documented history
of the law in this
area, but explicitly one-sided in unashamedly advocating greater restrictions on
free expression. There is no
consideration of arguments for greater freedom of
communication Of course, no article can currently answer the question to what
if at all, the implied constitutional protection of freedom of political
communication will invalidate such proscriptions. Professor
Richard Bartlett
discusses comprehensively The Status of Indigenous People in Australia’
and its history during the period
of European settlement. He is very critical of
the attitudes of settlers and Governments, as he is in many of his other
In a much less controversial—but probably far more important—area
of the lives of most people and businesses, Alexander
Reilly has carefully
analysed the financial and budgetary arrangements in the Australian Federation,
providing much very useful statistical
information in the process. Figures are
given for the last year before the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax as
a major taxation reform on 1 July 2001, as well as for later periods,
providing a very interesting comparison. He has identified
problems arising for
the pronounced vertical fiscal imbalance, such as the consequent reluctance of
States to privatise utilities.
The consequences of privatisation are also ably discussed by Martin Klapper,
in the context of administrative law, in the ‘Legal
Philosophy and
Theory’ section, where Iain Stewart makes many exceedingly interesting and
well argued and supported observations
in discussing The Structure of the
Australian Legal System’. Public finance and privatisation are also
relevant in Keturah
Whitford’s incisive discussion of issues relating to
‘Insolvency of Public Entities in Australia’. Finally, in
section, Klaus A Ziegert discusses ‘Australian Families and their
Law’, analysing the changes in both Australian
family law and comparative
law itself over the 20th century.
Business and economic issues are very well covered, with articles in the
‘Commercial Law’ section on ‘Liability
for Defective
Products’ (Professor Peter Gillies); ‘Present and Future of Real and
Personal Securities’ (Anne Wallace);
‘Limits and Control of
Competition with a View to International Harmonisation’ (Paul Latimer);
‘Rights of Minority
Shareholders’ (Keith Fletcher); and
‘Collective Agreements and Individual Contracts of Employment’
(Andrew Frazer).
Also, the section on ‘Dispute Resolution’ comprises an analysis
of developments in
Mediation in Australia
by Professor Tania Sourdin, and
dispute resolution in sport by Saul Fridman and Chris Davies. Apart from this,
commercial issues
are well represented. In ‘E-commerce’, Annelies
Moens and John Selby discuss the current issues of electronic transactions
on intellectual property, provides an account
of the effect of the recent
and clarity.
