Complainant AM v Local Council [2009] VPrivCmr 2 (20 February 2009)
Complainant AM v Local Council
[2009] VPrivCmr2
– Information Privacy Principle (IPP) 1
– allegation that a Local Council failed to give notice of the
collection of personal information (IPP 1.3(a)), and the purpose
for which the
personal information was collected (IPP 1.3(c)).
________________________________________________________________________
The Complaint
2009 VPrivCmr 2
The Complainant, his wife and two
children (the Complainants) attended a community event organised by their Local
Council. The Complainants
were aware that many people were taking photographs at
the event, but were not aware that a representative of the Local Council was
collecting images at the event.
The Complainants became aware that the Local Council had collected their
image some months after the event when a publication produced
by the Local
Council was placed in their letter box. A picture clearly identifying the
Complainants appeared on the front page of
the publication which they
subsequently learnt had been distributed throughout the municipality.
Attempts to resolve the complaints directly with the Local Council
The Complainants wrote to the Local Council outlining their concerns. The
Local Council responded by acknowledging the inappropriate
collection and use of
their image, and provided an apology to the Complainants. Shortly after however,
the Complainants received
two emails from the Local Council which appeared to
have been “cc’d” to the Complainants in error.
The first email between a junior staff member and her superior at the Local
Council enquired whether an offer of compensation would
be appropriate. The
second email offered possible strategies to placate the Complainants.
The Complainants notified the Local Council that it appeared they had
received the emails in error. Shortly after, the Complainants
received a letter
from the Local Council’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) stating that the
Local Council had carefully considered
the complaints and investigated the
surrounding circumstances.
In the letter, the CEO explained that because the images were collected in a
public place, he did not believe it inappropriate in
the circumstances to
publish the Complainants’ images. The CEO finalised the letter by stating
“We do not consider that
Council has breached the National (sic) Privacy
Principles”.
IPP 1 - Collection
The Complainants believed that the Local Council’s failure to inform
them that their images were collected and the purposes
for which their images
were collected constituted a failure to comply with IPP 1.
The Response
In its formal response to the Privacy Commissioner, the Local Council did not
dispute the Complainants’ view that the Local
Council had failed to comply
with one or more of the Information Privacy Principles resulting in an
interference with the privacy
of the Complainants (despite the CEO’s
initial view that there had not been a breach of the National Privacy
Principles). The
response (in part) stated:
“This incident has highlighted to Council the need to better manage
its database of photos taken at community events. Council
is currently
undertaking a complete review of these databases, deleting any photos that do
not have an appropriate consent and privacy
statement signed by the subject, and
putting in place more stringent procedures for the usage of photos. Council is
striving to ensure
that a similar incident does not occur in the future.”
The Local Council also expressed a willingness to participate in conciliation
in an attempt to resolve the matter.
The Privacy Commissioner considered that the Local Council’s failure to
adequately inform the Complainants that it was collecting
images at the
community event raised issues under IPP 1. On this basis, the Commissioner
referred the complaint to conciliation.
At conciliation, the Local Council representatives acknowledged the
inappropriateness of its emails to the Complainants. They further
that the Local Council had erred in its correspondence to the Complainants where
it referred to the National Privacy Principles
and had dismissed the complaint
on that basis.
The Complainants outlined to the Local Council how the publication of their
image had affected them. The Local Council representative
listened attentively
and empathically, and displayed genuine acknowledgement and understanding of the
Complainant’s feelings.
The complaint was resolved following an offer of financial compensation.
