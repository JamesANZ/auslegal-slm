REASONS FOR DECISION:
The issue for determination is whether on
the facts of this case the tribunal has jurisdiction.
Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd (“the
applicant”) was engaged by QCL to undertake repairs to the roof of a
concrete silo at
its Bulmer Island plant. The applicant contracted with K M
Cranes (“the respondent”) to lift equipment and material
to the roof
of the silo.
While the lifting was in progress a load
slipped through the slings after hitting the side of the structure damaging the
scaffolding
in the load.
On 20 March 2003 the applicant made a
claim in the tribunal for payment of $6,351.99 in respect of the materials
damaged when the
load was dropped.
By letter dated 7 April 2003 the
respondent requested that the proceedings be struck out on the basis that the
tribunal did not have
Each party filed detailed written
submissions. Further oral submissions were made by the applicant on 1 May 2003.
Under instructions
from its insurer, the respondent said nothing. Mr Mitchell
for the applicant submitted that although the respondent provided a service
hoisting materials, the dispute did not relate to the installation of the
hoisting equipment, but rather to events which occurred
during the course of
operation of that equipment.
Section 93 of the
Queensland Building
Tribunal Act 2000
(“the Act”) gives the tribunal jurisdiction to
decide building disputes.
Schedule 2 of the Act provides
(a) a domestic building dispute;
(b) a minor commercial building dispute;
(c) a major commercial building dispute if the parties to the
dispute consent to the dispute being heard by the tribunal under section
“Minor commercial building
dispute” is defined as:
commercial building dispute where neither the claim nor the counterclaim exceeds
“The definition of commercial
building dispute” includes:
(b) a claim or dispute
arising between 2 or more building contractors relating to the performance of
commercial building work or
a contract for the performance of commercial
building work; or
(c) a claim or dispute in negligence, nuisance
or trespass related to the performance of commercial building work other than a
for personal injuries ...”
Section 7 of the Act
‘building work’
The following
‘building work’
(a) the erection or
construction of a building;
(b) the renovation, alteration,
extension, improvement or repair of a building;
provision of electrical work, water supply, sewerage or drainage or other like
services for a building;
(d) the demolition, removal or
relocation of a building;
(e) any site work (including the
construction of retaining structures, driveways, landscaping and the
construction of a swimming
pool) related to building work of a kind mentioned in
paragraphs (a) to (d);
(f) the preparation of plans,
specifications or bills of quantity for the carrying out of building
(g) the inspection of a completed
(h) subject to subsection (3), work prescribed under a
regulation.
To remove doubt, it is declared
that domestic building work is building
The following is not
(a) the construction, extension, repair
or replacement of a water reticulation system, sewerage system or stormwater
drain, outside
the boundaries of private property;
building or maintenance of a road as defined under the
(c) the construction, maintenance or repair of a bridge,
other than a bridge on private property;
(d) the construction,
maintenance or repair of railway tracks, signals or associated structures,
unless the structures are buildings
for residential purposes, or are storage or
service facilities;
(e) the construction, maintenance or repair
of airport runways, taxiways and aprons;
(f) the construction,
maintenance or repair of ports or ports infrastructure, unless the structures
are buildings for residential
purposes, or are storage or service
facilities;
(g) the construction, maintenance or repair of a
(h) the construction, maintenance or repair of
communications installations performed for a public company or public body
in radio or television broadcasting or in some other form of
communications business or undertaking;
(i) the installation of
manufacturing equipment or equipment for hoisting, conveying or transporting
materials or products (including
primary produce), other than the installation
of fixed structures providing shelter for the
(j) construction work in
(k) work consisting of monumental masonry, sculpture, or
the erection or construction of statues, fountains or other works of art,
than work affecting the way in which a building is
constructed;
(l) building work carried out by the State for the
State or for an entity representing the State;
(m) building work
carried out by a local government for a local government, the State or an entity
representing a local government
or the State;
(n) building work
carried out outside Queensland.”
Having travelled this somewhat circuitous
legislative route it emerges that the matter to be determined is whether the
claim relates
to the performance of commercial building work. It matters not
whether the dispute is between building contractors, as it appears
undoubtedly
to be a dispute in negligence regardless of the nature of the work performed by
either the applicant or the respondent.
I accept the argument for the applicant
that the works in question fall outside the exclusion imposed by section 7(3)(i)
of the Act.
I find that the work being performed was not installation of
equipment for hoisting, conveying or transporting materials or products,
rather involved the use of the hoisting equipment. As the work being performed
related to repair of a fixed structure, I find
that it is building work pursuant
to section 7(1)(b) of the Act. Accordingly I find that the tribunal has
