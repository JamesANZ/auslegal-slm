Complainant AF v Local Council
[2007] VPrivCmr
2007 VPrivCmr 1
Collection of personal information
– allegation that a
local council failed to give notice of the purpose for which information was
collected. Use and disclosure
of personal information
allegation that a local council used and disclosed personal information for a
purpose unrelated to the primary purpose of
collection.
The Complaint
The Complainant was a food safety officer appointed by the restaurant in
accordance with a regime put in place by the Local Council.
The Complainant
undertook training for this role and was familiar with food safety laws and the
Council’s role in enforcing
these laws.
In October 2004, the Complainant wrote to a Council Officer expressing his
concerns that the cook smoked in the kitchen and the manager
smoked in the
restaurant during trading hours. The Complainant wrote that he understood that a
restaurant and its kitchen in particular
must be smoke free at all times. He
requested the Council’s assistance in making this clear to the restaurant
proprietor and
manager, intending that the Council speak to them.
The café proprietors were later prosecuted and fined for various
breaches of the
Food Act 1984
(Vic). None of the breaches related to the
events described in the Complainant’s letter. Nonetheless, the Complainant
that his letter was used as evidence in the prosecution in a way that
affected its outcome and, had the Complainant been informed
letter’s proposed use, the Complainant would have tried to persuade the
Council not to put the letter in front of the
courts or the Complainant would
have intervened in some other way.
IPP 1 - Collection
The Complainant alleged that in collecting the
information, the Respondent did not give notice about the purpose for which the
information
was collected (IPP 1.3(c)) nor had the Respondent given notice about
whom the information was usually disclosed to (IPP 1.3(d)).
IPP 2 - Use
The Complainant also alleged that the Respondent used
the information for a purpose different to the reason for collection.
Response to the Complaint
The Respondent noted that nothing in the Complainant’s
letter indicates that it is not an open letter to the Respondent. Neither
there anything in the letter that indicates that the Respondent is not entitled
to take action against the named restaurant for
the stated breaches of the
as it sees fit.
The Respondent maintained that the use and disclosure of the
Complainant’s personal information as part of its prosecution brief
related purpose that was reasonably necessary to allow the Respondent to lessen
or prevent a serious threat to public health
and for the purposes of law
enforcement in its capacity as a law enforcement agency.
The Complaint’s letter was unsolicited. The opportunities to give
notice about the purpose of a collection, and usual disclosures
are generally
limited when a collection is unsolicited. Moreover, IPP 1.3 does not require
notice in every case. Where an organisation
is acting in a law enforcement
capacity it may reasonably conclude that it is necessary not to give notice
(section 13
Information Privacy Act 2000
There was nothing in the Complainant’s letter to indicate that the
Complainant did not want the Council to disclose the letter
to others, or that
the Complainant did not think the Council was entitled to use it in a
prosecution. The Council Officer handling
the matter was entitled to rely on the
Complainant’s general awareness (as a Food Safety Officer) of the
requirements of the
and the Council’s enforcement and
prosecutorial role under that Act. On this basis, notice of the required matters
was implicitly
IPP 2 requires organisations to use and disclose personal information for the
primary purpose for which they collect it. Personal
information can be used and
disclosed if the use or disclosure is for a related secondary purpose that a
reasonable person would
expect. The test is an objective one – the
Complainant’s expectations as an individual are relevant here but not
determinative.
Arguably, the use of the letter in the prosecution brief was for
the primary purpose for which it was collected. If not for the primary
then the letter was used for the secondary purpose for which it was collected
and could reasonably be expected by a Food
Safety Officer with knowledge of the
The Privacy Commissioner decided that there was no breach of privacy and
declined to entertain the complaint.
At the request of the Complainant, the matter was referred to the Victorian
Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) for determination.
VCAT held it had

being unsolicited and containing information about
other persons, providing that
the author was identifiable.
VCAT dismissed the complaint and held that the Council did not breach IPP
1.3(c) or (d) in failing to notify the Complainant of the
purpose and usual
disclosures of the letter’s contents as these were implicit. Given that
the purpose of the letter was to
draw the Council’s attention to the
possible breaches of the
the usual disclosures in conducting
such an investigation are apparent. It was also held that the Council did not
breach IPP 2 as
the use of the information was for the primary purpose of
collection – being to investigate possible breaches of the
