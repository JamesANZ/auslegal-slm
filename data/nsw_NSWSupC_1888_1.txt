Barnett v. Anderson
Supreme Court of New South Wales
FosterJ., 5 October 1888
Sydney Mornnig Herald
, 6 October 1888, p. 10
In Chambers. - (Before his Honor Mr. Justice Foster.)
BARNETT V. ANDERSON.
Mr. C.B. Stephen appeared for the defendant, and applied for a change of venue from Sydney to Wagga Wagga, on the ground that he was
not likely to obtain a fair trial in Sydney, owing to an article having appeared in an evening newspaper in regard to the case; and
that it would be more convenient and less expensive that the witnesses should attend at Wagga Wagga. Mr. Pring appeared for the plaintiff
to oppose, and read an affidavit setting out that plaintiff was not likely to obtain a fair trial at Wagga Wagga, owing to the defendant
being a solicitor practising at Wagga Wagga, and therefore likely to be on friendly terms with residents who might be on the jury.
The action is one for alleged breach of promise of marriage.
His Honor said that he saw no reason to change the venue, but at the same time he thought that plaintiff was blameworthy if she caused
the article complained of to be inserted; costs to be costs in the cause.
