LICENSING COURT OF SOUTH
SGL HOTELS PTY LTD T/AS OVINGHAM HOTEL (BOMBAY BICYCLE
Application for Review of a decision of the
Commissioner
LC-24-00075
HEARING DATE:
21 August 2025
JUDGMENT OF:
Honour Judge BP Gilchrist
DELIVERED ON:
21 August 2025
(Reasons published 3 September
REPRESENTATION:
Applicant: Mr
Representative:
Applicant: Australian Hotels Association,
applicant, SGL Hotels Pty Ltd (SGL) had previously made an application to the
Liquor and Gambling Commissioner to vary its authorised
gaming hours in respect
of the gaming machines it operates at the Ovingham Hotel, otherwise known as the
Bombay Bicycle Club, which
is situated at 29 Torrens Road, Ovingham
Bombay Bicycle Club trades under a general and hotel licence. Its licence
permits it to sell liquor for consumption on the premises
between 5.00 am
to 3.00 am the following day, Monday to Saturday, and from 8.00 am to
3.00 am the following day, on Sunday. It is
therefore permitted to sell
liquor for on premises consumption until 3.00 am, seven days a week.
owns 40 entitlements for gaming machines at the premises, all of which have been
exercised, such 40 gaming machines operate at
the Bombay Bicycle Club. Under the
gaming machine licence issued for the premises, the current authorised gaming
hours are between
6.00 am to midnight, Monday to Thursday, and from
9.00 am to 3.00 am the following day, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Special conditions
apply for Good Friday, Christmas Day and New Years Day.
sought to vary these hours to permit gaming at the premises from 9.00 am to
3.00 am the following day, seven days a week. The
effect of the application
was to seek an alignment of the closing time for gaming with the closing time
for the sale of liquor for
consumption on the premises.
application was referred to a delegate of the Commissioner. The delegate
resolved to treat the application as a designated application
for the purposes
Gaming Machines Act 1992
(the GM Act). As such, the delegate could only grant the application if
satisfied that it was in the community interest to do so.
As it was, she was not
so satisfied and therefore refused it.
delegate made a finding that within two kilometres of the premises there were
two existing venues that were authorised to permit
gaming until 3.00 am
every day and that another was authorised to permit gaming until 2.00 am
every day. She therefore found that
late-night access to gaming machines was
already reasonably available within the locality.
delegate expressed concern about an over‑representation of young men and
renters whom she thought were more likely to experience
gambling related
delegate noted that within the locality there were three drug and alcohol
treatment centres and two pawnbrokers.
delegate found that the residential and stakeholder consultation did not
indicate a particularly high level of support.
delegate expressed particular concern about the potential for players using
gaming machines in the early hours of the morning
to experience gambling related
harm and expressed her dissatisfaction of SGL’s evidence of the measures
it intended to implement
to address this. She added that the evidence indicated
that there was a demonstrable increase in gaming at the venue between midnight
and 2.00 am and found it reasonable to draw the inference that to grant the
application would result in increased gaming at the premises
and increased
gambling related harm.
contended that the delegate made several errors in reaching her conclusion and
that this Court should determine the application
for itself and should grant
reasons published on 29 July 2024,
this Court found that the delegate’s decision was attenuated by error in
the sense that her decision was infected by some erroneous
findings of fact.
resolved that the Court needed to make its own evaluation of the application,
the Court noted that the application was a relatively
modest one and that there
would be some in the relevant community who would welcome the opportunity to use
gaming machines in the
early hours of the other days of the week, when the
premises are already licensed to sell liquor. It also must also be accepted that
the grant of the application will result in a very modest positive impact upon
employment at the premises.
Court accepted that the change in hours could have some negative implications
but added that “a finding of a possibility
of increased risk of gambling
related harm does not compel the refusal of an
application”.
It reasoned
that at worst, the grant of the application might result in a very small
increase in gambling related harm and that the
delegate’s decision to
refuse the application outright was disproportionate to that risk. It considered
that a preferable outcome
would be to grant the application on an interim basis
to determine what would be the effect of the change in gaming hours.
matter is now before this Court to evaluate the impact of that change. The
Commissioner was made aware of this hearing and it
is noted that the
Commissioner did not wish to participate in the proceedings.
provide statistical data in connection with the gaming revenue for its gaming
machines following the change in hours. Whilst it
showed some increase in
overall revenue the data showed a return to players of 91.385% which is above
the mandated minimum. And it
demonstrated an overall NGR that is just over 77%
of the average NGR for the council area, it being a well populated council area
with 21 venues and 787 gaming machines as of 30 June 2024. It noted
that there was no evidence of any concerns expressed by the regulator
regard to these matters, the Court was satisfied that the interim grant of 29
July 2025 should be made permanent and ordered
accordingly.
