Appeal Outcome
Not applicable
The offender, Trevor Clayton Murray, was jointly prosecuted with Edward
Joseph McGrath on 24 March 2014 [1]. It was alleged that they
assaulted Peter
Beattie and occasioned to him actual bodily harm on 15 December 2012 in Cowra,
New South Wales [1].
On 14 December 2012, the daughter of McGrath was allegedly kicked in the head
by the complainant, Beattie, in Cowra [13]. Whether
this allegation against the
complainant is true or not was not confirmed [13].
On 15 December 2012, the offender and McGrath, driven by Sandra Anderson,
went to the complainant's home in Cowra at about 3:00 pm
to confront him
regarding the alleged assault on McGrath's daughter [14].
The complainant retreated into his home when McGrath said "You're the fellow
who kicked by daughter in the head last night" [15].
The offender and McGrath
followed the complainant into his house [16]. McGrath punched and choked the
complainant and he suffered
relatively minor injuries [16]. McGrath told the
complainant that if he called the police, he would kill him [21]. The offender
then called away by Ms Anderson [26]. The facts are silent about the actions
of the offender other than his presence and perhaps
some actions at one point in
holding the complainant [18]. The offender played a very minimal role and there
was no allegation that
he struck a blow against the complainant [27].
The offender was arrested on 15 December 2012 and granted bail. On his
release on bail, the offender committed unrelated offences
for which he was
imprisoned [28]. Upon the offender's release, his parole was revoked due to him
leaving a drug rehabilitation centre
and he was placed back into custody [30]
Aboriginal Customary Law issues raised
Not applicable.
Aboriginal Cultural Practice or kinship issues raised
The Court accepted the offender's close relationship with his mother and that
he and his mother and siblings were abandoned by his
father when he was of a
young age [37].
Reference was also made, in the context of the offender breaching parole by
leaving a drug rehabilitation centre, that the offender
had suffered a number of
very significant personal tragedies including the loss of his mother and his
sister while in custody, meaning
he was unable to go to funerals and had no
doubt a great deal of grief to resolve [31]. The Court noted that, even
accepting an
underlying sense of grief, the offender left the rehabilitation
program because it suited him [33].
Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and / or indicators of disadvantage
The Court considered the offender's Aboriginality in light of the principles
R v Fernando
[2002] NSWCCA 28
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
[43]. The Court referred to passages from
and the findings of the Royal Commission into
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in the context of the extent to which mitigating
should be taken into consideration [44] – [57].
The Court cited a passage in
to note that, in any case in which
it is sought to rely on an offender's background of deprivation and mitigation
of sentence, it
is necessary to point to material to establish this background,
rather than merely assert this is the case [46].
The Court referred to
Munda v Western Australia
[2013] HCA 38
noted that, while mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, the Court
cannot "accept that Aboriginal offending is
to be viewed systematically as less
serious than offending by persons of other ethnicities" [50].
The Court also considered the extent to which imprisonment can be argued to
be a general deterrent when prolonged and widespread social
disadvantage has
produced communities that are demoralised and alienated [51] – [52].
In assessing the objective facts, the Court noted that the offender was
assessed by the Community Corrections as being suitable for
"medium to high
level" intervention. They also noted that he was previously unsuccessful in
recognising his frequent abuse of alcohol
and drugs, which has led to acts of
violence [56].
The Court noted that Aboriginal community leaders had on a number of
occasions reflected upon the concern about the incidence of domestic
within Aboriginal communities. However, this offence was not a domestic violence
offence [57]. The Court considered that
the offender had no reason to be
involved other than his loyalty to McGrath and his contribution to the level of
violence was minimal
The Court noted that the offender has a lengthy criminal record, first
appearing at the Children's Court when he was ten years of
age, reflecting the
extent of the dysfunction and dislocation of his upbringing [60]. The Court
noted that the offender was socialised
at a young age in a manner that made him
accept some aspects of anti-social behaviour as accepted norms [60]. While
accepting the
social context of the offender's upbringing as a relevant matter
to take into account, "his criminal history does not entitle him
particular leniency" [67] and a term of imprisonment was imposed
Relevant passage(s):
"I accept the prisoner has had a most disadvantaged upbringing which is
reflected in his past social and present social circumstances.
reflected eloquently in one sense by his history of offending." [36]
"I accept, of course, that he had a close relationship with his mother, that
he and his mother and his siblings were abandoned by
his father when he was of a
young age. I accept in the context of his upbringing on Erambie Mission that
his social circumstances
have contributed to his long-standing use or abuse of
drugs and his dependency upon prescribed and prohibited drugs." [37]
"[O]f course, it is a matter of which the Court can take judicial notice of
the social circumstances of the community from which the
offender comes."
"The principles that emerge in decisions such as
Fuller-Cust
and the like will continue to
have currency, even if there be continual offending." [55]
"I have little doubt that he was socialised at a young age in a manner that
made him accept some aspects of anti-social behaviour,
including acts of
violence and drug abuse, as accepted norms," [61]
"I accept the social context of the prisoner's upbringing as a relevant
matter and I have taken it into account. However, bearing
in mind his criminal
history does not entitle him to any particular leniency, fully understood as I
said in the wider context, bearing
in mind the time that he has been in custody
and his conduct since he was originally granted bail in relation to this matter,
regard to the maximum penalty of the offence in the context of the
provisions of s 5
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
, I can do nothing
else other than impose a term of imprisonment." [67]
"I realise the prisoner has had many opportunities to be released early on a
finding of special circumstances. But I still feel that
notwithstanding his
slips before it is to his advantage and the community's advantage, in the manner
discussed by Wood J in
Blackman and Walters
, that he continue at least at
this point to have that advantage." [71]
"Of course his prospects of rehabilitation and his likelihood of re-offending
are matters about which I cannot make a positive finding
on balance in his
favour. That would not be a reasonable conclusion in light of his past
performance." [70]
