https://nre.tas.gov.au/Documents/Tasmanian%20VSS%20-%20Standards%20and%20Guidance%20Notes.pdf
On page 42 the Guidelines state the following with respect to storage of Pentobarbital:
Pentobarbital
Appendix D of the
Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2008
(Regulation) lists Schedule 4 substances (prescription-only medicines) that have common therapeutic uses, but are also liable to
abuse, misuse and diversion, warranting more stringent controls on possession and supply. These substances are commonly referred
to as Schedule 4 Appendix D (S4D) medicines. S4D substances must be stored in a locked container and kept securely when not in immediate
use. The Board expects that Pentobarbital be stored in an
safe to prevent unauthorised access.
