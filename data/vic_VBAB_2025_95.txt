THE APPLICANT’S
STATEMENT OF CONTENTIONS (IN SUMMARY)
Applicant submits that the rectification strategy shown and described in the
Risk Assessment Report involves upgrades to the fire
safety system which will
enhance the overall safety of the Building by removing the exiting ACP-PE
(a) Around the Ground Floor entry and the entry canopy and first floor on the

Kairouz did not file a Statement of Contentions.
INTERESTED PARTY’S STATEMENT OF CONTENTIONS
an email to BAB dated 9 June 2025, the Municipal Building Surveyor stated that
he did not wish to file any material in support
of or in opposition to the
Applicant’s Application.
THE THIRD INTERESTED PARTY’S
STATEMENT OF CONTENTIONS (IN SUMMARY)
behalf of the Fire Rescue Commissioner, Fire Rescue Victoria (
submitted that –
Sector 1 – Little Collins Street
Elevation (North)
supports the removal of ACP from ground level up to a height of 9 metres.
However, external fire attack on the retained ACP above
9 metres will require
aerial appliances
Collins Street is a single vehicle carriageway providing one way access with
parking on the Northern side of the street at
the location of the
Sector 2 - Fleming Place Elevation (East)
the FRV supports the removal of ACP from Ground Level to a height of 9 metres,
it does not support the retention of ACP above
this height.
contends that retention of ACP above the fire hydrant and sprinkler booster
system produces a considerable risk of flaming droplets
and falling debris to
the area immediately below after firefighters have connected hoses to the feed
hydrants and booster connections
thereby creating an unacceptable hazard during
the emergency response procedures. This hazard can only be avoided by removal of
to the full height of the Building.
aerial firefighting appliances maybe impeded by the width of Little Collins
Street and the limited locations to connect to
a public water main within that
Sector 3 – South Elevation (Access Laneway –
extension of Fleming Place)
No ACP has been identified.
Sector 4 – West
supports the removal of ACP from Ground Level to 9 metres above Ground
in combating an incident involving ACP in this location, firefighters will need
to undertake external suppression activities
at the pedestrian level, using
aerial appliances connected to a public water main within Little Collins Street.
to Sectors 1 and 2, the aerial appliances may be impeded by vehicles parked in
Little Collins Street or the delay setting
up an alternative location.
the Risk Assessment Report fails to refer to or address the following issues
(a) The Cladding Assessment Report Rev.01 dated April 2023 (
(b) How the wall insulation on the internal side of the ACP influences the
evaluation or rectification strategy;
(c) How the Queensland Guideline is relevant to this proceeding which involves a
building in Victoria;
(d) Architectural Drawing No: 24-20-WD08 A1 (Early Works) does not show removal
of ACP to a height of 9 metres above Ground Level;
(e) The hose reel cabinet adjoining the Early Warning Intercommunication System
(EWIS) cabinet is used for storage of items obstructing
the use of the hose reel
which may prevent the occupants of the Building undertaking an initial fire
APPLICANT’S STATEMENT IN REPLY (IN SUMMARY)
Applicant acknowledges that the location of the retained cladding and
accessibility from Little Collins Street may pose challenges
in the event of a
fire. However, the remaining ACP is most likely to be ignited from an internal
fire which reaches the flashover
and breaches the windows. Due to an automatic
fire suppression system, the scenario is unlikely.
2023 CAR serves as the basis for the Risk Assessment Report.
assessed in Section 6.2 of the Risk Assessment Report, the risks associated with
the internal combustible insulation were considered
to be tolerable and hence no
further action was required. In the absence of a standard practice or guideline
for sampling combustible
cladding in Victoria, the Queensland Guidelines were
used to comply with best industry practice.
removal of cladding has been marked up on the architectural drawings in Section
6.4 of the Risk Assessment Report.

have considered all the information made available as part of the Application
including the Statements of Contentions filed by
the Applicant and the Fire
Rescue Commissioner.
believe the following issues to be relevant in consideration of the high hazard
posed by 100% Polyethylene core ACP and whether
the partial retention proposal
is reasonable and not detrimental to the public interest.
brigade intervention has not been incorporated within the proposed fire safety
strategy for the building. This was explained
on the basis that the likelihood
of ignition of the ACP was low and therefore no fire would occur, so fire
brigade intervention was
not expected to be necessary and is not relied upon.
We consider that this is erroneous because fire brigade intervention may be
necessary when the fire safety features do not perform as intended, when the
fire severity exceeds that anticipated, or where human/occupant
activities or
behaviours are not as envisaged. It is not acceptable to us that fire brigade
intervention is disregarded in this
manner where the proposal includes retention
of combustible cladding, particularly in the case of 100% polyethylene core ACP.
Furthermore,
FRV presented the difficulties associated with a cladding fire at
this location however these matters were not further analysed to
satisfy FRV
and/or facilitate fire brigade intervention.
ACP located on the east façade over Fleming Lane is positioned over the
path of travel from the rear exit and located over
the booster assembly. This
presents additional difficulties for egress and fire brigade intervention.
Evacuation analyses and/or
emergency procedures which address different fire
scenarios should have been considered to assess the impact of an ACP fire at
location and ensure the locations of ACP retention do not adversely impact
life safety. Furthermore, FRV expressed concern with
100% polyethylene core ACP
positioned above the booster assembly.
contradiction to The Risk Assessment Report clause 2.1.1, a Building Notice has
been issued by the City of Melbourne and the matters
contained therein are not
considered by the Applicant.
Risk Assessment Report in Tables 5 and 6 for the North and East facades identify
ignition sources to include vehicles, yet only
flame heights resulting from bin
fires were considered in the analysis. Vehicle fires including cars, vans and
trucks should have
been included in the quantitative assessment and analyses
presented. Continuous and intermittent flame heights resulting from such
are considerably more severe than those presented for bin fires.
Risk Assessment Report in Tables 5 and 6 for the North and East facades identify
the ACP to present a high fuel load and high
contribution to fire spread.
Clause 3.2.2 describes a bespoke performance design for structural FRLs, yet no
information was provided
in relation to this issue or how an ACP fire could
impact the design and performance of building FRLs.
Risk Assessment Report concluded that it was not reasonable to remove more ACP
on the basis of cost. However, a detailed analysis
of cost versus risk was not
presented to justify this assertion, and the cost versus risk for other options
was not available, for
example to account for flame heights resulting from a
vehicle/truck fire. Since removal of ACP via scaffolding up to 9m is proposed,
replacement works are evidently reasonable. Furthermore, the ACP was installed
in 2004 for aesthetic reasons as a refurbishment
for the building which
reinforces the reasonableness associated with such work scope. That is, there
is limited difficulty in further
reducing or eliminating fire risk by
implementing additional ACP replacement.
Applicant has not established that partial retention of 100% polyethylene core
ACP is reasonable, or conversely that further replacement
of these ACPs is
unreasonable. Therefore, and as envisaged with the So Far As Is Reasonably
Practicable approach to fire risk, the
difficulty of ACP removal is not a
hinderance for this building and removal of the 100% PE ACP should be undertaken
until it is no
longer reasonable. The Risk Assessment Report has not developed
the solution in accordance with this principle.
conclusions drawn in The Risk Assessment Report have not shown that it is in the
public interest to retain 100% polyethylene core
ACP considering it was approved
pursuant to a specific building permit for aesthetic refurbishment purposes.
consider that, based on all the information and evidence made available to us
and for the reasons provided, we are not satisfied
that a modification or
variation of the relevant building regulations is reasonable and not detrimental
to the public interest.
Therefore, the relief sought in the application
pursuant to
of the Act is
