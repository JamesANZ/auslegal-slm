Appeal Outcome
Leave to appeal against the sentence is granted and the appeal allowed.
[42] An extension of time to apply for leave to appeal is
granted. [42] Sentence
imposed by the Supreme Court quashed; the offender is re-sentenced to
imprisonment for 21 years and four months,
with a non-parole period of 16 years.
The applicant/offender, Kirrlie Shane Wilson, is a person of Aboriginal
descent. [21] He was aged 32 at the time of sentence and the
father of four
children. [19], [22] He was selling amphetamines at the time of the offence as a
means of income. [19] The offender
had a ‘relatively minor’ criminal
record dating from 1992. [19] He lived in ‘very deprived
circumstances’
growing up and was subject to ‘considerable
violence’ at the hands of his stepfather. [21] The offender took the full
brunt of the violence in the home after some of his siblings were taken into
care. [21] He completed a year 9 level of schooling
before leaving home at the
age of sixteen. [21]
The deceased was a person engaged in trafficking drugs. [9] Shortly before
his death he had come into possession of a large amount
of money as a result of
an armed robbery he had committed. [9] Spencer, a co-offender, was determined to
have this money stolen and
he contacted the offender for this purpose and
arranged to meet him outside the deceased’s townhouse. [9] Spencer
the offender that earlier in the evening on which the robbery had been
planned the deceased was acting in a threatening manner, brandishing
and was apparently affected by drugs. [9] Spencer warned the offender to be
armed. [9] Following a prior meeting, the
offender and co-offender Frazer met
Spencer at the premises at about 4am. [11] Spencer let the offender and Frazer
inside. [11]
The offender and Frazer confronted the deceased in his townhouse. [12] Two
shots were fired from the pistol with which the offender
was armed. [12] One
struck the deceased in the forehead. [12] The deceased bore defensive injuries
to his arms and injuries which
indicated he had been pistol whipped. [12]
Immediately after the shooting, the offender and Frazer left the premises. [13]
The offender
repeatedly apologised to Frazer for what happened. [13]
Evidence given during the trial by the offender was to the effect that a drug
deal was set up between the deceased and the offender.
[15] The offender’s
evidence claimed that neither he nor Frazer were armed when they entered the
premises. [15] The offender
said that the deceased threatened him with a weapon
and during an ensuing struggle the firearm accidentally discharged. [15] The
primary judge found that the offender lost his temper and intended to kill the
deceased when he fired the pistol. [16]
Despite the ‘seriously criminal’ activity leading up to the
murder, Howie J considered the offence ‘an armed robbery
wrong’ and the killing to be unplanned. [18] His Honour declined to make a
finding of special circumstances and assessed
the objective seriousness of the
offence at slightly higher than midrange. [26] The original sentence imposed was
26 years and six
months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 20 years.
The offender gave evidence that following the offence and prior to arrest he
made efforts to improve his situation in life by obtaining
employment and
completing a course. [23], [34] He submitted that he had a strong subjective
case and relied upon the favourable findings
made by the primary judge. [32],
Hoeben CJ took note of events which occurred between sentencing and the
current court. The offender had been in custody for nine years,
during which
there was only two breaches of gaol discipline. [29] He received high
assessments for co-operation and leadership from
Corrective Services. [29] The
offender completed various traineeships and programs and is on the Aboriginal
Inmate Delegate Committee
at the Lithgow detention facility. [29] While in
prison he lost contact with members of his family, including his four children.

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/or indicators of disadvantage
Hoeben CJ took several matters into account and held that the offender had a
‘strong subjective case’ which had become
stronger over the last
nine years. [38] These include the offender’s ‘deprived
circumstances’ as a child and the
‘considerable violence’
inflicted upon him by his stepfather. [21] It was held that ‘the effects
of his profound
childhood deprivation’ left him with personality problems
and needed to be fully taken into account. [22], [38] The Court also
the offender completed year 9 level of education by correspondence before
leaving home at the age of 16. [21]
His Honour highlighted the offender’s drug use and considered it to his
‘considerable credit’ that the offender
was able to successfully
remove himself from the ‘drug taking milieu’ and avoid serious
conflict with the law. [22],
[38] The Court noted that the offender had
recognised his problems with anger and had completed two courses whilst in
address the issue. [22] The offender submitted that ‘his
difficulties with controlling his temper were linked to issues arising
deprived childhood and this was relevant to his moral culpability for the
offending.’ [33] The offender’s tendency
to anger is held to be
relevant in the shooting of the deceased. [22]
The Court accepted that the offender was unlikely to
reoffend, insofar as firearms were concerned. [25], [38] His Honour thought the
offender had shown signs of maturity and had no doubt he would continue to do so
over the period of his incarceration. [25] However,
the objective seriousness of
the offence was substantial and the Court made note that though the offender has
expressed remorse for
the killing, he has not expressed remorse for the robbery
nor admitted the killing occurred in the way found by the primary judge.
Relevant passage(s)
‘His Honour [the primary judge, Howie J] concluded that there was
little doubt that the offender’s background had left
him with personality
problems, but that it was to his considerable credit that he was able to
overcome his use of drugs and largely
avoid serious conflict with the law,
especially insofar as offences of violence were concerned.’ [22]
‘Moreover, the effects of his profound childhood deprivation do not
diminish with the passage of time and need to be fully taken
account.’ [38]
Grounds of appeal
The offender sought an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal
against original sentence on the ground that the primary
judge erred in his
approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the
principles identified in
Muldrock v The Queen
[2011] HCA 39.
Appeal outcome(s)
The Court unanimously upheld the ground of appeal. Factors considered
relevant to the application for extension of time include the
length of delay,
the reasons for the delay and the prospects of success should an extension be
granted. [6] As the offender had not
contributed to the delay and
error’ has been conceded by the Crown, an extension
of time was granted. [7]-[8], [42] Leave to appeal against sentence allowed
appeal granted.
Hoeben CJ emphasised that ‘while the issue of personal deterrence may
have reduced in significance with the passage of time,
the principles of general
deterrence and denunciation remain relevant and important.’ [40] Hoeben CJ
concluded a lesser sentence
was warranted and reduced the minimum term of
imprisonment to 16 years, with a balance of term of 5 years and 4 months. [42]
orders were agreed with by Hall and Garling JJ. [43]-[44]
