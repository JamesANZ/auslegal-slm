Tribunal’s Statement of Reasons
[4] The Tribunal considered a number of psychiatric and psychological reports.
These included a clinical report prepared by Dr Purushothaman
dated 18 September
2018 to which was annexed the Assessment and Risk Management Committee
) meeting minutes of 2 August 2018 and a second opinion of Dr
Frances Dark dated 21 February 2018. The Tribunal also had before it
of Dr Schramm dated 20 August 2018 which had been produced by him pursuant to a
Tribunal Examination Order. There was also
a report dated 2 March 2018 from the
Community Forensic Outreach Service (
) by Dr Garrick Anderson,
psychiatrist, and Ms Annette Vasey, psychologist.
[5] Both Dr Purushothaman and Dr Schramm gave oral evidence before the Tribunal.
The evidence of Dr Purushothaman was that the respondent
did not have a
diagnosable mental illness or intellectual disability. According to Dr
Purushothaman the respondent was not taking
any medication and did not require
any. He saw Dr Purushothaman every two months and Ms Martin, who was a part of
the treating team,
every three weeks. Neither clinician had any concerns, or
had seen any symptoms of mental illness. In Dr Dark’s opinion the
respondent’s period of mental illness was relatively brief and there had
been no evidence of diagnosable mental illness for
over six years and no need
for psychopharmacology.
[6] The Tribunal referred to Dr Schramm’s opinion that the respondent does
not have a mental condition, neither intellectual
impairment nor a mental
illness. Dr Schramm’s opinion was that the respondent does not have a
mental illness in remission
(meaning a disease in partial or full abeyance, but
with reasonable chance of return). Dr Schramm confirmed in evidence that a
predisposition
to depression in the future did not mean that the respondent had
a present mental condition.
[7] The Tribunal identified that on a periodic review it must decide either to
confirm or revoke the forensic order for the person.
It referred to s 442(1)
which requires the Tribunal to “confirm the forensic order if the
[T]ribunal considers the order is
necessary, because of the person’s
mental condition, to protect the safety of the community, including from the
risk of serious
harm to other persons or
The Tribunal then
reasoned that if the elements of the test posed by s 442(1) are satisfied, the
forensic order must be confirmed
and unless all elements of the test are
satisfied the forensic order must be
[8] The Tribunal then considered the meaning of “mental condition”
in s 442(1).
The Tribunal referred
to the recent decision of Dalton J in [2018] QMHC
concluding that the definition
of “mental condition” is narrower than had been previously
considered by the Tribunal.
[9] The Tribunal then considered at what point in time is the existence of a
“mental condition” to be assessed, noting
that the Tribunal makes a
decision as to whether the elements of the test are met at the time of
conducting the particular review.
The Tribunal referred to the decision of Justice Holmes (as the Chief Justice
then was) in
her Honour considered s 203 of the MHA 2000 which provided that on the review,
the Tribunal must decide to confirm or revoke
the forensic order for the
patient. Her Honour
The whole point of the s 203 discretion is to recognise that the mental
condition underlying a forensic order is not necessarily
immutable. It does not
amount to an attack on the original finding to consider whether the condition
continues to exist ... In my
view, the proper construction of s 203 is that the
decision to confirm or revoke must be based on the factors set out in s 203(6),
as applied to the current set of circumstances. ...”
[10] The Tribunal considered that while this decision was made under the
previous legislation, the principle is directly referable
to the decision
required by the Tribunal under s 441 of the MHA
[11] The Tribunal then reasoned that as the respondent does not have a present
mental illness, the Tribunal was in effect bound to
revoke the forensic
Tribunal now has unanimous relevant and reliable evidence of
Dr Purushothaman, a second opinion from Dr Dark, and a detailed
report from
Dr Schramm that [the respondent] does not have a mental illness. It is not the
case that he has an illness of which
there are no active symptoms, it is not the
case that he has an illness in remission. The propensity or vulnerability to
a future illness is not a current mental illness. ...
The Tribunal has sufficient evidence to find on the balance of probabilities
that [the respondent] does not have a mental condition
as defined in the Act.
The Tribunal relies on Justice Dalton’s interpretation of ‘mental
condition’ and its own
interpretation of that term, and of the test in
s442, and finds the forensic order cannot be confirmed. It is accordingly
As risk deriving from a mental condition is a necessary condition for the
making of a treatment support order, on the same reasoning,
the Tribunal cannot
make a treatment support order.”
[12] After referring to the Victim Impact Statement that had been filed
[redacted] urging the Tribunal to confirm the forensic order,
the Tribunal
Tribunal has read this statement with empathy for the family [redacted]. The
Tribunal must apply the law as set out in
the Act, and the risks relevant to the
Tribunal’s consideration are those arising from a mental condition.
Having found [the
respondent] does not have a mental condition, [the
family’s] submissions, whilst acknowledged, could not be given significant
weight in the Tribunal’s decision.”
The Tribunal’s Decision is Stayed
[13] On 2 November 2018 Dalton J granted a stay of the decision of the Tribunal
pursuant to s 544 of the MHA 2016 pending the disposition
of the present
The Appellant’s Submissions
[14] The appellant identifies the question for determination on appeal as
“whether the Tribunal erred in its conclusion that
s 442(1) of the [MHA
2016] required [the respondent] to have a current existing ‘mental
condition’ as a prerequisite
to confirming the forensic
[15] In answering that question, the appellant submits as
Tribunal erred in concluding the test for confirming the forensic order in s 442
of the [MHA 2016] could not be satisfied
because the need for the order to
protect the safety of the community must derive from the person’s present
and existing mental
illness. The reasoning applied being, if there is no
present and existing mental illness, then there can be no order....
The forensic order regime under the [MHA 2016] is first and foremost a risk
protection mechanism serving one of the main objects of
the [MHA 2016], that is,
protecting the community from harm by persons have been diverted from the
criminal justice system.
As part of that risk management scheme, orders can, not only mandate
involuntary treatment, but also provide a level of oversight,
support and
monitoring to protect the community from harm. Orders may also contain other
conditions not associated with treatment
of the patient but with the protection
of others (for example, conditions relating to driving, the use of substances
and contact
with victims).
If the Tribunal’s reasoning is accepted as correct, then any patient
afforded a defence of unsoundness of mind due to a transient
or episodic mental
illness, despite a risk of recurrence, cannot be supervised under the forensic
order or treatment support order
regime because they do not have a current
mental illness. The Tribunal’s approach placed far too great an emphasis
conditions of the forensic order mandating involuntary psychiatric
treatment, including the ability to prescribe medication, and
failed to consider
that the forensic order regime is primarily a risk protection mechanism for the
community, of which involuntary
treatment only forms part.”
[16] The effect of treating the existence of a mental condition at the time of
review as a jurisdictional fact resulted in the Tribunal
not undertaking the
necessary risk assessment mandated by the MHA 2016 prior to it revoking the
forensic order and declining to impose
a treatment support
Chief Psychiatrist’s Submissions
[17] The Chief Psychiatrist generally supports the construction of s 442(1) of
the MHA 2016 advanced by the appellant.
[18] The Chief Psychiatrist “submits that the use of the words
‘because of the person’s mental condition’
442(1)... does not mean that, for the forensic order to be confirmed, it is
necessary for the person currently to have
‘some form of diagnosable
illness’ as the [T]ribunal
concluded”.
[19] According to the Chief Psychiatrist, “[i]n assessing risk to the
community as required by s 442(1), it is appropriate
to take into account a
previously suffered mental illness and to consider whether it might
Such a construction
promotes the clear purpose of s 442(1), which is to protect the safety of
the community”.
reflected in one of the main objects of the MHA 2016 stated in s 3(1)(c) which
is, “to protect the community if persons
diverted from the criminal
justice system may be at risk of harming others”. Further, s 442(1) does
not expressly require
that the person have an existing mental illness as a
precondition to the confirmation of a forensic order by the Tribunal . This
to be contrasted with the statutory regime under the MHA 2016 for the making and
review of treatment authorities for involuntary
treatment under s 28(1)(a).
Section 421(1) relevantly mandates that “[o]n a review of a treatment
authority the [T]ribunal
must revoke the authority if the [T]ribunal
considers— (a) the treatment criteria no longer apply to the person
the authority”. In turn, s 12 sets out the matters
constituting the “treatment” criteria for a person, one of
that “the person has a mental illness”. The legislature has
therefore used clear and unequivocal language in
relation to treatment
authorities to the effect that, if, at the time of reviewing the treatment
authority, the person does not have
a mental illness, the Tribunal must revoke
the authority. This is to be contrasted with the wording of s 442(1), which
neither expressly
nor by necessary implication, mandates a similar outcome where
the Tribunal is reviewing a forensic order.
Respondent’s Submissions
[20] The respondent seeks to support the Tribunal’s decision by submitting
that the term “mental condition” in
s 442(1) refers to an existing
mental state.
The respondent
makes reference to the definition of “mental condition” in Schedule
3 to the MHA 2016, which includes
a mental illness and an intellectual
disability.
[21] The respondent submits that the word “condition” in the
expression “mental condition” should be given
its plain meaning,
consistent with the purposes of the MHA
and the same meaning
throughout the whole Act.
reference to the plain meaning of the word, the respondent submits that the word
“condition” within the expression
“mental condition”
refers to an existing state, and not a state which may in future
This interpretation
according to the respondent is consistent with the objects of the MHA 2016 and
in particular s 3(2)(a) which
states that the main objects of the Act identified
in s 3(1)(a) to (c) are to be achieved in a way that safeguards the rights
persons. The term “mental condition” in s 442(1) should
therefore be construed so as not to impute to the legislature
an intention to
interfere with “fundamental
The respondent
therefore submits that nothing in the MHA 2016 either expressly or by necessary
implication “allows the erosion
of the fundamental right to personal
liberty on the basis of a
speculation
that a person may be
suffering a mental illness or natural mental infirmity in the future or
a recurrence of such a
condition.”
Consideration
[22] Section 3(1) of the MHA 2016 identifies the three main objects of the Act
as follows:
“(a) to improve and maintain the health and
wellbeing of persons who have a mental illness who do not have the capacity to
to be treated; and
(b) to enable persons to be diverted from the criminal justice system if
found to have been of unsound mind at the time of committing
an unlawful act or
to be unfit for trial; and
(c) to protect the community if persons diverted from the criminal justice
system may be at risk of harming others.”
[23] Section 3(2) provides that these three main objects are to be achieved in a
“(a) safeguards the rights of persons; and
(b) is the least restrictive of the rights and liberties of a person who has
a mental illness; and
(c) promotes the recovery of a person who has a mental illness, and the
person’s ability to live in the community, without the
involuntary treatment and care.”
[24] In the present case the respondent was diverted from the criminal justice
system. [Redacted] The Mental Health Court was satisfied
on the balance of
probabilities that the respondent’s mental illness deprived him of the
capacity to understand the nature
and quality of his actions, and of the
capacity to control his actions.
[25] [Redacted] Since being made, the forensic order has been reviewed by the
Tribunal according to statutory requirements. As the
respondent has already
been diverted from the criminal justice system, the primary object of the MHA
2016 that is relevant to these
reviews is the object of protecting the community
if persons (such as the respondent) diverted from the criminal justice system
be at risk of harming others.
[26] Under the MHA 2000 the Tribunal was required to
review a forensic patient’s mental condition within six months after the
forensic order was made and thereafter at intervals of not more than six months.
The Tribunal was also required to review a forensic
patient’s mental
condition on application for review made under s 201 of the MHA 2000.
Similarly, under s 433 of the MHA 2016
the Tribunal must review the forensic
order within six months after the order is made and thereafter at intervals of
not more than
six months. The Tribunal must also review a forensic order on
application made pursuant to s 433(2). The Tribunal may at any time
initiative also review the forensic order: s 433(3). Unlike the MHA 2016, the
MHA 2000 did not identify as one of its
main objects the protection of the
community. Section 4 of the MHA 2000 identified the purpose of the Act as being
to “provide
for the involuntary assessment and treatment and the
protection of persons (whether adults or minors) who have mental illnesses while
at the same time— (a) safeguarding their rights and freedoms; and (b)
balancing their rights and freedoms with the rights and
freedoms of other
persons.” This is not the specific language of protection of the
community as provided for in s 3(1)(c)
of the MHA 2016. The MHA 2000 in s 5
did, however, identify how the purpose of the Act was to be achieved. This
included s 5(e),
which provided that “when making a decision under [the
MHA 2000] about a forensic patient”, “the protection of
community” was to be taken into account. One of the primary differences
therefore between the MHA 2000 and the MHA 2016
is that the protection of the
community, rather than being a means by which the purpose of the MHA 2000 was to
be achieved, has been
elevated to being one of the main objects of the MHA 2016.
The primacy of this main object is evident not only by being expressly
in s 3(1)(c) of the MHA 2016, but also by the legislature imposing a number of
limitations on the Tribunal’s power
to revoke a forensic order or alter
the category of a forensic order made by the Mental Health Court.
[27] Before I discuss these limitations it is
important to note that what is being reviewed by the Tribunal is a forensic
by the Mental Health Court. While the present order was made on
[redacted] under the MHA 2000, by operation of the transitional
provisions of s
836 of the MHA 2016, the order is taken to be a forensic order (mental health)
under the MHA 2016. Under Chapter
12 Part 3 of the MHA 2016 what the Tribunal
reviews is either a forensic order (mental health) or a forensic order
(disability) made
by the Mental Health Court. Both types of forensic orders are
made by the Mental Health Court under s 134(1), which adopts the test
to s 442(1). Section 431 of the MHA 2016 defines “review” of a
forensic order to include a periodic review
of the order. Accordingly, what the
Tribunal was reviewing in the present case was a forensic order (mental health),
which was an
order that could only be made by the Mental Health Court, but
thereafter periodically reviewed by the Tribunal.
[28] Pursuant to s 441(1) on a periodic review of the forensic order, the
Tribunal must decide either to confirm the order or revoke
the order. The first
limitation on the Tribunal revoking an order is where the Mental Health Court,
pursuant to s 137(2), has ordered
a non-revocation period. During this period
the Tribunal may not revoke the order, other than under s 457 irrespective of
the person has an existing mental condition or not. Section 457 only
applies to circumstances where a person has a dual disability
and is subject to
a forensic order (mental health). In those limited circumstances, if the
Tribunal is satisfied that the person
no longer requires involuntary treatment
and care for the person’s mental illness, the Tribunal must revoke the
forensic order
(mental health) and make a forensic order (disability) for the
In circumstances where
there is a non-revocation period for a forensic order, the Tribunal is taken for
the purposes of s 443 to
have confirmed the
[29] Another limitation is not so much a restriction on the Tribunal’s
power to revoke a forensic order but rather a practical
consequence of the
mandatory requirement that, pursuant to s 442(1), the Tribunal must confirm the
forensic order if the Tribunal
considers the order is necessary, because of the
person’s mental condition, to protect the safety of the community,
from the risk of serious harm to other persons or property. As I have
already observed, the language of s 442(1) is similar to the
mandatory language
used in s 134(1) in respect of the Mental Health Court making a forensic
Further, where the
Tribunal confirms a forensic order, it must apply a similar test in deciding
whether to change the category of
a forensic order. Section 444(2), for
example, provides that “the [T]ribunal may change the category of the
forensic order
to community, or confirm the category of the order as community,
only if the [T]ribunal is satisfied there is not an unacceptable
risk to the
safety of the community, because of the person’s mental condition,
including the risk of serious harm to other
persons or property.” To
similar effect, under s 445(2)(b), if the forensic order is confirmed as or
changed to inpatient,
the Tribunal may “approve that an authorised doctor
under section 212 or a senior practitioner under the Forensic Disability
section 20 may, at a future time – (i) authorise limited community
treatment for the person, to the extent and subject to the
conditions decided
the [T]ribunal; or (ii) change the category of the order to community, subject
to the conditions decided by the
[T]ribunal.”
[30] In some circumstances the Tribunal may make an order under s 445(2)(b)
“only if the [T]ribunal is satisfied there is not
an unacceptable risk to
the safety of the community, because of the person’s mental condition,
including the risk of serious
harm to other persons or property”: s
[31] As part of the relevant test each of these sections refers to a
person’s “mental condition” which is defined
“a mental illness and an intellectual
disability”.
these terms are also defined. Section 10(1) of the MHA 2016 defines
“mental illness” as “a condition
characterised by a clinically
significant disturbance of thought, mood, perception or memory”. This is
subject to s 10(2),
which provides that “a person must not be considered
to have a mental illness merely because” of an enumerated attribute
circumstance. The term “intellectual disability” is defined in
Schedule 3 to the MHA 2016. The term “mental
condition” as used
throughout the Act is therefore simply a shorthand way of referring to both
mental illness and intellectual
disability. As the term is a composite phrase
already defined by the Act, it is wrong to further refine the construction of
condition” by emphasising the apparent plain meaning of
“condition”, as contended by the respondent.
[32] The review being undertaken by the Tribunal is a review of an existing
forensic order made by the Mental Health Court. In deciding
to either confirm
or revoke the forensic order, the Tribunal must have regard to those matters
stated in s 432. These matters are
similar to those to which the Mental
Health Court must have regard under s 133 in making a forensic order. Both ss
133 and 432 require
the Tribunal and the Mental Health Court respectively to
have regard to “the relevant circumstances of the person”.
“relevant circumstances” of a person is a defined term in Schedule 3
to the MHA 2016:
relevant circumstances
a person, means each of the following—
(a) the person’s mental state and psychiatric history;
(b) any intellectual disability of the person;
(c) the person’s social circumstances, including, for example, family
and social support;
(d) the person’s response to treatment and care and the person’s
willingness to receive appropriate treatment and care;
(e) if relevant, the person’s response to previous treatment in the
community.”
[33] The word “treatment” is also defined in Schedule
of a person who has a mental illness
or other mental condition, includes anything done, or to be done, with the
intention of having
a therapeutic effect on the person’s illness,
including the provision of a diagnostic procedure.”
[34] Both the definition of “relevant circumstances” and
“treatment” support the proposition that in conducting
a review the
Tribunal must have regard not only to the person’s existing mental state,
but also to the person’s psychiatric
history and the history of the
person’s response to treatment. The matters to which the Tribunal must
have regard in conducting
a review of a forensic order indicate that a
longitudinal assessment should be made of the person’s mental condition,
psychiatric
history and treatment history.
[35] When one considers the meaning of “mental condition” in the
context of s 442(1), the objects of the Act, and the
role of the Tribunal in
reviewing a forensic order made by the Mental Health Court, the Tribunal, in my
view, erred in finding that
a current existing mental illness was a prerequisite
to the confirmation of a forensic order or the making of a treatment support
order. A person’s existing mental condition is, of course, relevant in
any review. But there is nothing in the wording of
s 442(1) which makes the
current existence of a mental condition a prerequisite to the Tribunal
exercising its power to confirm a
forensic order. In undertaking a review with
regard to the matters in s 432, the Tribunal must consider not only the
existing mental condition but also the person’s psychiatric
and treatment history, as well as the nature of the relevant unlawful
the period of time that has passed since the act happened and any victim impact
statement relating to the relevant unlawful
act. It is apparent from the
reasons of the Tribunal outlined above that the Tribunal felt constrained in
giving proper consideration
to the victim impact statement and whether a
treatment support order should be made because of its finding that the
respondent did
not have a current existing “mental condition”.
[36] By treating the current existence of a mental illness as a prerequisite,
the Tribunal has impermissibly limited its review role
in a way not contemplated
by s 442(1). There is no threshold requirement in the MHA 2016 that a person
must have a current mental
illness in order for the Tribunal to undertake a
review of a forensic order.
[37] This interpretation of s 442(1) and the MHA 2016 as a whole is validated by
considering the potential consequences resulting
from the Tribunal’s
interpretation. There may be instances where a person’s mental condition
is in remission at the
time of a review by the Tribunal yet there is clinical
evidence that the chance of remission – and consequent risk to the
– is high. If the Tribunal’s interpretation is correct,
then it would be obliged to revoke the forensic order and thereby
protective measures secured by the order. Indeed, the Tribunal would be obliged
to revoke even where the risk presented
by such a person was greater than other
persons with an existing mental condition at the time of review. That outcome
with the protective purpose of the MHA 2016, which is plainly
expressed to be one of the main objects: s 3(1)(c).
[38] Contrary to the respondent’s submission, an interpretation of s
442(1) that does not require there to be an existing mental
condition at the
time of review should not be viewed as allowing an unjustifiable deprivation of
fundamental rights. Before confirming
a forensic order, it remains for the
Tribunal to satisfy itself that the order is necessary to protect the safety of
the community
and that such necessity is because of the person’s mental
condition. The test propounded by s 442(1) is one to be applied
to many and
varying circumstances. A person’s current existing “mental
condition”, while an important consideration,
is but one of a number of
matters, including those mandated in s 432, which must be considered by the
Tribunal in applying the test.
that decision is readily distinguishable.
was decided under
the MHA 2000. As I have already observed, unlike the MHA 2016, the MHA 2000 did
not specifically identify as either
an object or a purpose the protection of the
community if persons diverted from the criminal justice system may be at risk of
others. Further, under the MHA 2000 there was a difference as to what
the Tribunal actually reviewed. What is now reviewed by the
Tribunal is the
forensic order originally made by the Mental Health
What was previously
reviewed by the Tribunal, pursuant to s 200 of the MHA 2000, was the
“forensic patient’s mental
condition”. The MHA 2000, unlike
the MHA 2016 did not define the term “mental condition” but did
define the term
“forensic patient” to mean a person who is, or is
liable to be, detained in an authorised mental health service under
