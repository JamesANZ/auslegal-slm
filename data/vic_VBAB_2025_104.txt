20 March 2025, Paul McArd and Amy McArd (
the Applicants
) applied for the
consent of the Respondent, Hobsons Bay City Council, (
the Council
building permit application for a proposed design in respect of a front fence to
be erected/built at 36 Tobruk Crescent, Williamstown
the Subject Land
front fence would be constructed at a maximum height of 1.825 m instead of the
required 1.2 m required under reg 89 of the
Building Regulations 2018
the Regulations
reg 89 of the Regulations:
The report and consent of the relevant
council must be obtained to an application for a building permit in relation to
a design that
does not comply with this regulation
30 April 2025 the Council refused consent, reasoning that:
considering the relevant considerations contained within Minister’s
Guidelines MG/12:
the fence is not
required for the minimisation of noise intrusion; and
will result in a
disruption to the streetscape; and
height, setback and design are not consistent with any relevant neighbourhood
character objective, policy or statement set
out in the relevant planning
scheme, and
will not be
appropriate taking into account the prevailing heights, setbacks and design of
existing front fences on nearby allotments;
the slope of the
allotment and or existing retaining walls or fences do not reduce the effective
height of the wall.
21 May 2025, the Applicants appealed the decision (
Building Act 1993
Building Act
) to the Building
Appeals Board (
Appeal was heard ‘on the papers’ on 17 July 2025.
have considered the parties’ written submissions and the material filed in
the BAB. I have also had regard to the applicable
Decision Guidelines set out
under the Minister’s Guideline MG-12, given it is a relevant consideration
for the BAB to consider.
on these considerations I make the following findings:
objective of the Guideline Siting Requirement 16 for front fence height is to
ensure that the front fence design respects the
existing or preferred character
of the neighbourhood.
proposed fence is a solid construction and although the Applicants cited some
examples of fences of a similar height in the neighbourhood,
the predominant
character is not one of high solid fences. I find that the height and design of
the proposed fence does not meet
the objective for front fence height
considering the existing character of the neighbourhood.
considering the decision criteria in MG-12:
a) Criterion (a) – the Applicants cited 3 out of the 58 properties in
Tobruk Crescent with fences over 1.8m high. Most nearby
properties have low or
no front fences. I find that the proposed fence will not be more appropriate
taking into account the prevailing
heights, setbacks and design of existing
front fences on nearby allotments.
b) Criterion (b) Tobruk Crescent is a residential street so the fence is not
required for the minimisation of noise intrusion.
c) Criterion (c) for the reasons stated in paragraph 11.a) above I find that the
fence height will result in a disruption of the
streetscape.
d) In respect of Criteria (d) and (e) for Guideline Siting Requirement 16, I
find the fence will not be more appropriate taking into
account the prevailing
heights, setbacks and design of existing front fences on nearby allotments and
that effective height of the
fence will not be reduced by the slope of the
allotment nor by any existing fences or retaining walls.
regard to the foregoing, I find that the decision of the Council should be
DATE OF DETERMINATION: 22 August 2025
Clause 17 of Schedule 3 to the
Building Act 1993
provides: ‘Unless the Building Appeals Board
otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board must bear his,
or its own costs’.
