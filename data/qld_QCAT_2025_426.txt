Anand Gokani of Gokani &Associates Legal
REASONS FOR DECISION
applicant Beaumont Australia Pty Ltd (Beaumont) had been the registered lessee
of premises at 4 Ereton Drive Arundel since
2015. The respondent PRYV 04 Pty Ltd
(‘PRYV’) acquired the freehold of the premises during the course of
lease on 8 September 2023. A dispute arose with respect to
primarily rent and asserted arrears of rent and the form and quantum of
security bond applicable. Beaumont sought orders as follows.
1. Beaumont was not in breach of its lease
2 Beaumont was not indebted to PRYV for rent or outgoings payable under the
lease for the period from lease inception (2015) to 30
August 2023.
3 Beaumont had validly exercised its option to extend the lease to 31 January
4 PRYV pay compensation of $203,785.00 to Beaumont or such other sum as the
Tribunal determined.
response PRYV sought orders as follows.
1. A declaration that the lease over the premises 4 Ereton Drive Arundel is
comprised only of the registered lease and registered
2. A declaration that Beaumont is in breach of the registered lease.
3. A declaration that Beaumont is not permitted to exercise its option in the
registered lease.
4. Beaumont pay PRYV the monetary sum it claims.
5. Such other orders as the Tribunal deems appropriate.
6. Beaumont’s application be otherwise dismissed.
[3] On 16 August
2024 the Tribunal made interim orders including as follows.
1. PRYV to immediately reinstate Beaumont’s access to the premises at 4
Ereton Drive Arundel (consequent on lockout).
2. PRYV be restrained from issuing a notice of determination of lease,
re-entering the premises, or otherwise taking steps to enforce
the alleged and
disputed breaches the subject of the proceeding.
[4] On 9 May
2025 the Tribunal directed the hearing be limited to final written submissions
and submissions in reply. Consideration
is therefore limited to Beaumont’s
submissions of 20 May 2025, PRYV submissions of 21 May 2025, Beaumont’s
submissions
in reply of 3 June 2025 and PRYV’s submissions of 3 June 2025
(including documents/material referenced in all those submissions).
submissions constituted the totality of submissions considered by the Tribunal
at the hearing and for the purpose of coming
to its decision.
conclusion of the hearing, in view of the absence of case law based on similar
fact evidence the parties were given 14
days to produce any case law or further
case law they considered would be of assistance to the Tribunal in coming to its
final decision
Background and Evidence
[6] Beaumont
originally leased the premises 4 Ereton Drive Arundel from Leo Terence Anderson
and Del Enid Anderson as trustees (original
owner) for a period of five years
from 1 February 2015 to 31 January 2020 together with four options of five years
each. In November
2015 LDD Executive Pty Ltd as trustee acquired the freehold
(prior owner). In early 2020 by amendment the lease period expiry date
recorded as 31 January 2025 together with four options of five years each
(effectively extending the life of the lease for a
further five years). Both the
original lease and the amendment were registered on the freehold title. The
freehold was sold to PRYV
in July 2023 with settlement on 8 September 2023.
[7] According to
Beaumont from lease inception to September 2023 rent and outgoings were reviewed
and agreed between Beaumont and
the original owner and prior owner not
necessarily following the strict terms of the registered lease. Email
correspondence confirmatory
of variations in rent often conducted by phone was
produced to the Tribunal. Rent and outgoings as agreed were evidenced by monthly
invoices issued by the original and prior owners and paid by Beaumont.
Twenty-three invoices were produced for the period 13 March
2015 to 15 August
2023. The prior owners invoice dated 15 August 2023 for rent and outgoings for
the period 2 August 2023 to 2 September
2023 recorded the amount due at that
point as nil. At the foot of that invoice appeared the words “Inv 628 and
Inv 631 paid
in full 28 September finalising rent period with Anderson Family
Trust. No outstanding. Many thanks Diane Anderson”. In addition,
Diane Anderson emailed Beaumont’s Chris Roberts on 29 September 2023
stating “Received payment made in full.
Rent payments are complete for
tenancy period with Anderson Family Trust. Many thanks and wish you all the best
in the future”.
[8] In that same
period on 17 March 2022 the prior owner in the person of Diane Anderson emailed
Chris Roberts Beaumont manager stating.
I trust everything is back on track again after closures etc with covid. And
hopefully business is picking up successfully. As you
may be aware that I have
not applied any CPI increases since February 2017. Due to quiet times and covid
situations, I have held
your rent and also assisted in these difficult times.
But now I must apply a 5% increase bringing rent to $10,344.54 plus GST. I
retain outgoings; you may remember that I didn’t charge that last time
either. But I’m sure you realise that everything
has gone up, but that can
remain as they are. So, if we could start this from invoice sent 15 May, due in
June. Please let me know
if this is a problem. Look forward to hearing from you.
[9] On the day
following, 18 March 2022 Chris Roberts emailed Diane Anderson stating.
Hi Diane, thanks for your email and support over the years. Very much
appreciated. With regards to the increase, are we able to meet
at 3.5% increase?
Then reviewed in line with the lease at the next anniversary Happy to discuss
[10] The same
day Diane Anderson replied.
Yes, of course. That sounds reasonable at 3.5% increase. I will apply to May
increase, due June. $10,196.75 plus GST and outgoings.
[11] Beaumont
submitted that the mere fact that the amounts invoiced and paid did not align to
a mathematical calculation of rent
escalation was not evidence of an
underpayment. There was nothing in the lease nor in the
Retail Shop Leases Act
(Qld) (RSL Act) that precluded alternative arrangements with respect to
payment by agreement of rent or outgoings.
[12] Beaumont
stated that at the time of PRYV’s acquisition of the freehold in September
2023 it was paying $12,362.00 inclusive
of GST in rent and outgoings on a
monthly basis.
[13] On 24 May
2024 Beaumont was issued with a Notice to Remedy Breach of Covenant by PRYV
giving it 14 days to pay firstly $29,313.94
for rent and outgoings for the
period 1 February 2015 to 31 August 2023 and for provision of a bank guarantee
in the sum of $31,564.50
(first notice to remedy breach). Beaumont confirmed
rent and outgoings were paid in accord with agreement made with the prior owner.
In addition, the lease schedule in PRYV’s purchase contract stating,
“current rent per annum of $122,361.00 plus GST
plus capped
outgoings” accorded with the sum stated in the prior owners’
original owner did not require Beaumont to provide a bank guarantee as such was
provided for in the lease at the outset but
rather a cash bond of $10,500.00 was
accepted by agreement. It was asserted by reference to the email of 19 October
2023 from Gokani
& Associates on behalf of PRYV to Beaumont that in lieu of
a bank guarantee for $31,564.50 a cash bond for the same sum could
be provided
(less the $10,500.00 already provided).
[15] On 12 June
2024 Beaumont was locked out of the premises for failure to comply with the
notice to remedy breach. On 27 June 2024
Beaumont applied to the Tribunal for an
interim order for PRYV to provide immediate access to the premises, for PRYV to
provide documentary
evidence of underpayment of rent and compensation for loss
incurred. On 16 August 2024 the Tribunal ordered that in addition to
reinstatement of immediate access to the premises and restraint
on lease determination and re-entry PRYV was to produce documents
possession for the period 1 February 2015 to 31 July 2024 including invoices and
receipts for rent and outgoings, annual estimates
of outgoings, final statements
of outgoings, annual audited statements of outgoings, contract of sale
settlement statement at point
of sale in September 2023 and calculations of rent
deposits and outgoings. Upon re-entry on 16 August 2024 Beaumont paid rent
neither could agree on the monthly rent payable. Any claim for
compensation and costs would be considered as part of the substantive
proceeding.
[16] In the
interim on 17 July 2024 a second notice to remedy breach had been issued by PRYV
for rent and outgoings for the period
1 July 2024 to 31 July 2024 in the sum of
$13,339. 23 inclusive of GST. On 14 August 2024 Beaumont notified PRYV of its
to exercise the five-year option to extend the lease to 31 January
[17] Beaumont
claimed $203,785.00 for direct and consequential loss due to the lockout to 31
December 2024 set out in its schedule
of claim filed 30 January 2025 made up of
incurred during the lockout period without sales revenue - $82,709.00.
(B) Loss of
normal operating profit (after costs) during the lockout period -
$35,092.00.
overhead costs during the lockout period - $14,463.00.
(D) Consequential
loss of profit for the period to 31 December 2024 - $71,521.00.
[18] Beaumont
stated the method of calculation could be summarised as follows.
(a) Revenue was determined on an average daily basis using the three months
sales immediately prior to lockout.
(b) The trading margin (gross profit) was calculated using the same margin
percentage realised in the same three-month period.
(c) Wages were the actual wages paid to employees plus usual on-costs of
superannuation, payroll tax etc.
(d) Consequential loss relating to lower custom was calculated by reference to
the same average daily sales compared to actual sales
following reopening.
Beaumont conceded it had not been possible to provide evidence to validate its
assumptions key aspects of financial records
were produced. Beaumont relied on
its schedule of claim filed 30 January 2025 detailing all losses incurred but
was amenable to an
independent auditor’s review of its calculations.
submissions PRYV stated that Beaumont sought to assert rights based on alleged
unregistered or verbal arrangements made with
the prior owner; that such
arrangements took preference over the terms of the registered lease as against a
bona fide purchaser for
valuable consideration. Such a position was not
maintainable because the precise terms of such arrangements had not been
there was no valid contract or deed, such arrangements were not
registered and notice of such arrangements were not provided by either
or the prior owner prior to completion of the contract of sale. PRYV considered
there were prior multiple breaches of the
registered lease with respect to
provision of bank guarantee, underpayment of rent and outgoings as well as costs
consequences for
failure to comply. It was asserted Beaumont had demonstrated a
pattern of non-compliance with the registered lease for many years
elected not to respond to multiple requests by PRYV to rectify identified
[21] It was
asserted that where a registered lease is the subject of unregistered or verbal
arrangements any rights claimed by a tenant
(Beaumont) against the new landlord
(PRYV) are to be examined through the lens of equitable principles. Only the
Supreme Court had
or equity to impose liability on PRYV for any preacquisition conduct
prior owner.
[22] PRYV drew a
comparison between Beaumont’s parent corporation Wesfarmers Limited
(Wesfarmers) as an “enormously resourced
landlord” with 26,000 times
larger financial resources than itself.
[23] PRYV sought
a declaration that Beaumont was in breach of the registered lease because it did
not provide a bank guarantee, historically
underpaid rent and outgoings and
failed to meet PRYV’s costs associated with breaches. The registered lease
provided for provision
of a bank guarantee from lease commencement date. During
the course of the registered lease the prior owner rejected Beaumont’s
request to formally remove the requirement for a bank guarantee. The guarantee
was only provided on the 18 June 2024. The dilatory
provision of the bank
guarantee by Beaumont did not cure the breach of the registered lease and caused
PRYV to incur costs that could
have been avoided.
[24] PRYV sought
rent shortfall for the entire period 1 February 2015 to 31 August 2023 in the
sum of $29,486.57. Any purported dealings
with the prior owner were not binding
on PRYV which never adopted any such arrangements. Upon being invoiced current
rent by PRYV
post completion of the contract of sale Beaumont commenced paying
rent and outgoings in accord with those invoices. However, no rent
and outgoings
were paid during the re-entry/lockout period. Re-entry did not amount to
termination. When again in possession of the
premises Beaumont was not paying
rent and outgoings in accord with the registered lease. Rent payment breaches
were established.
[25] It was
asserted there was a shortfall in payment of outgoings in the period 1 July 2018
to 31 August 2023 in the sum of $10,577.17.
Entitlement to recovery was on the
same basis as that for rent shortfall.
claimed costs consequent on default under the registered lease on the basis that
such were reasonably incurred to protect
its legitimate interests.
[27] PRYV sought
a declaration that Beaumont was not permitted to exercise its five-year option
set to commence on 1 February 2025.
Beaumont being in default any purported
exercise of option would be void and of no effect.
[28] PRYV sought
interest at the rate nominated in the registered lease on monies found to be due
but unpaid as well as interest on
loss associated with restraint to terminate
the registered lease and costs incurred in the period 30 June 2024 to 18 March
finally sought dismissal of Beaumont’s application in full.
submissions in reply Beaumont stated PRYV knew what the actual rent was at the
time of purchase and would have appreciated
it differed from what it would have
been had the registered lease rent review provisions been strictly applied for
the reason the
actual annual rent was stated in the freehold contract of sale.
Additionally, the registered lease provided for agreement on rent
despite the express procedures for rent adjustment. Clause 4.1 of lease annexure
C was cited as allowing for owner and
lessee to agree on rent despite the
procedure prescribed for periodic “market reviews”.
[31] Beaumont
submitted that rent and outgoings payable from the date PRYV assumed ownership
ought to be.
rent $122,361.00 plus GST per annum (the annual rent recorded on the contract
for PYRV’s purchase of the freehold).
contributions a maximum of $15,000.00 plus GST per annum.
rent subject to CPI review on 1 February 2024 and market review on 1 February
rent and outgoings contributions were still in issue the proceeding could be
adjourned for the parties to resolve differences.
[32] Beaumont
stated it was not contending that arrangements with the original owner and prior
owner overrode and took preference
over the terms of the registered lease as
against a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration, here PRYV. Whilst PRYV
argue it was not bound by such arrangements from the time it assumed
ownership it could not claim back payment of alleged shortfalls
of rent and
outgoings where Beaumont had paid rent and outgoings as agreed between it and
the original owner and prior owner. Nor
did those prior arrangements bind PRYV
or affect its rights under the registered lease from its point of acquisition.
The terms of
the registered lease were not altered by those arrangements apropos
PYRV as a bona fide purchaser going forward.
respect to exercise of option Beaumont submitted there had been no act or
omission that constituted a breach of its leasehold
obligations that would have
precluded it from exercising its option to renew. Even if there had been
pursuant to
section 128
Property Law Act 1974
(Qld) an act or
omission it would not have had the effect of precluding Beaumont from exercising
such option because in the 14 days
following exercise of option PRYV did not
serve on it the prescribed notice of act or omission.
[34] It was
argued that costs were not applicable for the reason there had not been any
breach of the lease terms. Section 100 of
the Queensland Civil and
Administrative Act 2009 (Qld) which states the initial or primary position is
that each party bear their
own costs was relied on by Beaumont.
submissions in reply PRYV stated though rent continued to be paid it was not in
accord with either the terms of the registered
lease or tax invoices issued. The
bank guarantee required was only furnished some nine months after first
required. The cash bond
was only ever a deposit. The sale contract was not
capable of overriding or operating in priority to the terms of the registered
lease. Beaumont had failed to establish that PRYV had unlawfully entered the
asserted that even if re-entry was unlawful there was a failure on
Beaumont’s part to mitigate its loss in that it
could have firstly
furnished a bank guarantee in 2021 when a request for removal of the lease bank
guarantee provision was turned
down, secondly placed PRYV on notice as to any
purported prior dealings, thirdly paid PRYV a sum of money under protest thereby
avoiding accumulating costs and lastly a failure to demonstrate loss of

notice to remedy breach dated 24 May 2024 sought $29,313.94 including GST for
rent and outgoings arrears for the period 1
February 2015 to 31 August 2023.
Item 4 of annexure A to the lease document provided for CPI rent review on
numerous dates including
2022, 2023, and 2024 and market review in 2025, 2030
[38] On 18 March
2022 Beaumont and the prior owner agreed to a CPI increase of 3.5% which was in
excess of the capped 3% increase
(due to non-application of CPI increases for
some years prior). The 3.5% CPI increase was applied from May 2022 rent due

contract of sale for the purchase of the freehold dated 2 July 2023 and
completed 8 September 2023 recited “current
rent per annum $122,361.00
plus GST plus capped outgoings. That is a monthly rent inclusive of GST of
$11,216.43 precisely the same
figure as agreed between Beaumont and the prior
owner (Anderson) on 18 March 2022.
[40] Clause 5.2
of annexure C to the lease document stated.
The right of the lessor and the lessee to initiate or require a determination of
the new rental pursuant to this annexure C as at
any relevant review date shall
not prevent, impede, or restrict the Lessor and Lessee at any time after the due
relevant review date

with effect from the due relevant review date.
[41] Neither
party produced any evidence of any CPI rental review in about February 2023. Nor
do the rent review or market review
provisions of annexure C, whilst capping
increases, state that any sort of increase was obligatory. From 9 September 2023
after completion of the purchase contract PRYV increased monthly rent
from $10,196.75 to $10.559.78 ($11,238.15 and $11,809.78 inclusive
of GST) for
the period through to 31 January 2024.
January 2024 PRYV issued Beaumont a rent review notice and tax invoices for
revised rent and outgoings for the period 1
February 2024 to 31 January 2025.
Until 1 July 2024 Beaumont paid the tax invoices issued and did not raise any
concerns about same.
Monthly rent and outgoings (charged at the capped rate)
totalled $13,339.23.
[43] Clause 4.2
of annexure D to the lease document provided that if outgoings for a particular
year were less than $15,000.00 per
annum cap the lessee would only be required
to pay the actual outgoings and not the full sum of the cap. Email
correspondence of
17 March 2022 between Diane Anderson and Chris Roberts
Beaumont manager records reintroduction of outgoings after a break on the
that “everything has gone up “. PRYV produced an estimate of yearly
outgoings of $31,193.68 which included insurance,
land tax, rates and water
though the Tribunal observes land tax is precluded form inclusion in outgoings
pursuant to Section 7(3)(a)
of the RSL Act.
[44] In the
period 12 September 2023 to 24 May 2024, about eight months, there was
correspondence, engagement, negotiation, and rejection
but no finality with
respect to asserted arrears of rent and provision of a bank guarantee. On 24 May
2024 PRYV informed Beaumont
that provision of a $31,564.50 cash bond was not
agreed to due to cost involved. A bank guarantee was required. That prompted
to issue the first notice to remedy breach on 24 May 2024. That notice
demanded provision of a bank guarantee for $31,564.50 within
14 days, that is,
by 7 June 2024. According to Beaumont PRYV had reneged on its agreement to
accept a cash deposit and not informed
Beaumont. It should have done that before
demanding a bank guarantee in 14 days. On 28 May 2024 Beaumont informed PRYV
that the bank
guarantee process would require consultation with and input from
PRYV. Contact details were requested for that process to commence.
guarantee was provided initially electronically on 18 June 2024 twenty-five days
after being notified that it was required.
[45] On 12 June
2024 PRYV re-entered the premises due to non-payment of rent arrears and
non-provision of bank guarantee. Beaumont
was locked out.
[46] On 2 July
2024 Beaumont filed in the Tribunal an application for interim order seeking
access to the premises. On 16 August 2024
after failure of mediation in the
interim the Tribunal reinstated Beaumont’s access to the premises. Prior
on the 17 July 2024
PRYV issued a second notice to remedy breach for rent and
outgoings for the period 1 July 2024 to 31 July 2024 in the sum of $13,339.23.
August 2024 Beaumont gave notice of its intention to exercise of a five-year
option available under the registered lease.
It did not consider it was in
breach of the registered lease and therefore entitled to exercise such

period 16 August 2024 to 31 January 2025
totalling $58,763.25. A market review
provided for in the registered lease was due on 1 February 2025. On 12 February
2025 PRYV engaged
a valuer to complete a market rental assessment. PRYV stated
the market rent as $16,250.00 plus GST per month and outgoings as $2,004.39
GST per month.
pointed to a number of propositions/concerns including equitable jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court as an avenue of recovery,
lack of consideration for lease
variation, necessity for a deed of variation, registered lease being a
reversionary interest, rental
concessions during the covid period and power
imbalance between PRYV and Beaumont.
[50] Beaumont
produced post hearing two cases relevant to its position. Firstly, Ashmore
Developments Pty Ltd v Eaton
was there held “that
section 117
Property Law Act
conferred on the assignee of the reversion a right to the benefit of arrears of
rent accrued prior to the assignment and
once that right was acquired by the
assignee it was lost by the assignor in the absence of agreement to the
contrary”. Here
it was contended there were no arrears of rent at point
of sale only variations by agreement long since carried into effect. Secondly,
Lo Giudice v Biviano (No 2)
held there that “on the proper construction of the lease, the option of
renewal ceased to be exercisable after the
lease had been determined, prior to
the expiration of the term, for non-payment of rent. Here it was contended the
registered lease
had not been determined and that the option to renew had been
properly exercised.
produced a number of cases in support of it position that lease registration was
paramount, three cases more prominently.
They were Diemasters Pty Ltd v
Meadowcorp Pty Ltd
, Cassegrain v
Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd
and State of Queensland v Morecroft &
. It was contended that if the
lease was registered on the title, then the parties’ rights ran in accord
with what was registered
on the title. A licence or informal agreement did not
run with the land.
Conclusions
premises is the subject of a retail shop lease
pursuant to the Retail Shop Leases
Act 1994 (RSL Act). Section 83 of the RSL Act states that the Queensland Civil
and Administrative
Tribunal (‘QCAT’) “may make the orders,
including declaratory orders, QCAT considers to be just to resolve a retail
tenancy dispute”. Orders could include an order for a party to a dispute
to do, or not to do, anything, an order requiring
a party to a dispute to pay an
amount (including an amount for compensation) to a specified person, and an
order that a party to
a dispute is not required to pay an amount to a specified
person. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction with respect to retail shop leases
all encompassing. The Tribunal is empowered to deal holistically with retail
shop leases disputes whether the lease is registered
or not. The very wording of
the RSL Act does not envisage other jurisdictions involvement (other than
appeals and the imposition
of a monetary jurisdictional limit not relevant
here). If it did it would have said so. In short, save for appeals and monetary
limit, the retail shop lease jurisdiction here resides entirely
within the Tribunal.
[53] QCAT is
empowered to deal with matters under an enabling act (here the RSL Act) in a way
that is accessible, fair, just, economical,
The Tribunal is obliged in
conducting the proceeding to act fairly and according to the substantial merits
of the case observing
the rules of natural justice, not being bound by the rules
of evidence, informing itself in any way it considers appropriate, acting
as little formality as possible and ensuring all relevant material is disclosed
to enable it to decide the
proceeding.
incoming owner PRYV is protected by the terms of the
registered lease in
its capacity as a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration. It was never
envisaged that lease registration
would result in an abrogation of the
Tribunal’s right and duty to bring about an outcome that is fair and
reasonable. Nor was
it ever the case that lease registration was meant (in the
context of the Tribunals expansive power to make orders it considered
to resolve a retail tenancy dispute) to give PRYV authority to act as a
retrospective arbiter of prior arrangements made
between Beaumont and the prior
owner over a period of years and long since carried into effect. It was never a
case of a pattern
of non-compliance. The exchanges between Beaumont’s
Chris Roberts and prior owner’s Diane Anderson are indicative of
agreeable commercial relationship encompassing a good deal of give and take.
compelling evidence of those prior arrangements being carried into effect are
the twenty-three invoices produced for the
period 13 March 2013 to 15 August
2023, payment of those invoices, acknowledgement of rent and outgoings paid in
full as of 2 September
2023 and email exchanges between Beaumont’s Chris
Roberts and prior owners Diane Anderson even to the extent of Diane Anderson
wishing Beaumont all the best for the future in September 2023. Nor was Beaumont
ever under any obligation to explain prior arrangements/variations
years (some of which so far back in time as to raise difficulty in producing any
tangible record) to PRYV. It may have
been unfortunate in retrospect not to do
so but it was never an obligation. What is clear is that there was a flexible
informal commercially
friendly relationship between the original owner, the
prior owner, and Beaumont with the registered lease sitting in the background.
Nor did Beaumont pursue permanent continuity of any diminution in rent. It did
not know what further accommodation would be granted,
if any, by PRYV as
incoming owner. On 9 September 2023 the day after settlement of the purchase
contract PRYV increased the rent.
It then set rent and outgoings at $13,339.23
for the period 1 February 2024 to 31 January 2025. Beaumont paid through to 1
[56] Any lack of
disclosure if indeed there was any by the prior owner at the time of contracting
to sell the freehold was not the
fault of nor referable to Beaumont. If there
was that would be a matter for those two parties. Nor was it for PRYV to draw
conclusions
were breaches of the registered lease. Because a variation was
not recorded
formally did not mean it did not occur or was not agreed to.
[57] The case
law proffered by the parties has virtually no applicability to the subject
circumstances. Where the original owner/prior
owner has accepted a lesser sum on
account of rent at any particular time not only can it be construed as a
variation of the registered
lease terms but (even if that cannot be upheld) can
also be construed as being in full satisfaction of the rent payment obligation
at the time. In other words, diminished payment of rent was accepted as full
compliance with rent obligations under the registered
lease. That is abundantly
clear from the manner in which the prior owner and Beaumont parted company in
2023. There is a clear differentiation
between prior breach actionable by a
subsequent purchaser of the freehold and deemed compliance with lease terms as
agreed between
a prior owner and tenant.
[58] To the
extent the first notice to remedy breach dated 24 May 2024 demanded payment of
long since settled rent (not rent arrears)
it was invalid in the context of the
Tribunal’s obligation to be fair, just, economical, informal, and quick.
[59] Neither the
original owner nor the prior owner ever insisted on provision of a bank
guarantee strictly in accord with the registered
lease. Rather a cash bond was
accepted by agreement from the outset to point of sale by the original and prior
owner. Whilst there
was a formal request by Beaumont in 2021 for the bank
guarantee requirement to be dispensed with that appears to have come about
to the takeover of Beaumont by Wesfarmers and policies associated with such
national entities. It was rejected with the result
the registered lease was left
as is. There was never any attempt by the prior owner to then enforce the bank
guarantee provision.
Rather the prior owner saw no benefit in agreeing to the
requested variation and the cash bond of $10,500.00 simply remained in place
ongoing. The cash bond arrangement subsisted otherwise unperturbed from 1
February 2015 to at least 8 September 2023 a period of
over eight years.
[60] The first
notice to remedy breach dated 24 May 2024 gave fourteen days to provide a bank
guarantee. Following an exchange of
emails between PRYV and Beaumont in the
preceding September and October 2023, PRYV advised Beaumont by email on 19
October 2023 that
it would accept increasing the cash bond from $10,500.00 to
$31,564.50 in lieu of a bank guarantee. PRYV advanced no documentation
position on this point changed until it advised Beaumont by email dated 24 May
2024 that it insisted on a bank guarantee.
[61] It seemed
to be argued by PRYV that due to Beaumont’s latter day parent company
Wesfarmers much greater size that it should
have been able to produce a bank
guarantee virtually immediately. On 28 May 2024 Beaumont informed PRYV that the
bank guarantee process
would require consultation with and input from PRYV. In
the event the bank guarantee was provided on the 18 June 2024 twenty-five
after demand. In the context of an arrangement that had subsisted for over eight
years and the absence of any finality in the
period September 2023 to 24 May
2024 the Tribunal finds the demand for provision in fourteen days even if
marginally extended was
unreasonable. In Hookey & Anor v Whitelaw &
it was found in
circumstances where there was a prior history of engagement dispute and
negotiation, absent finality, that a notice
to remedy breach, about amongst
other things, financial security by way of a bank guarantee giving two months to
remedy the breach
was “reasonable time”. Here provision of the bank
guarantee in 25 days was reasonable by any measure.
PRYV’s implication that it was David up against Goliath is at odds with
the evidence particularly PRYV’s evidence
which was suffocatingly
voluminous given the issues involved. Rather PRYV presented as an extremely
savvy commercially oriented player.
[63] In summary
the first notice to remedy breach was invalid in its entirety. The re-entry on
12 June 2024 was entirely without just
cause. It was argued that re-entry did
not in any event constitute termination. That may well be the case where the
re-entry was
justified. Where re-entry is not justified accompanied by lockout
and associated business loss it is difficult to see where continuity
of rent in the lockout period can be justified. It follows that the second
notice to remedy breach for unpaid rent being
based on the legitimacy of the
lockout was also invalid.
[64] There was
never any dispute about the actual 14 August 2024 timing of exercise of option
for the period 1 February 2025 to 31
January 2030. Rather it seems it was
contended that Beaumont was precluded from exercising the option perforce of
existing breaches.
There being no breach of the registered lease as of 14 August
2024 the Tribunal finds the option for the further five years to 31
January 2030
was validly exercised.
invoices from 1 February 2024 for monthly rent and outgoings totalling
$13,339.23 were paid to 1 July 2024 except for the
period 12 June 2024 to 16
August 2024 when no rent or outgoings were paid. There is no reason why rent and
outgoings ought not to
have continued at the rate of $13,339.23 per month
through to 31 January 2025. Rent and outgoings at the rate of $13,339.23 for the
period 1 June 2024 to 31 January 2025 totals $106,713.84. That sum less a
lockout credit of 18 days in June (12 June to 30 June),
$8,003.54, the month of
July, $13,339.23 and 16 days in August (1 August to 16 August), $6,884.76, a
total of $28,227.53, results
in net rent and outgoings for the period of
$78,486.31 ($106,713.84 minus $28,227.53).
[66] Rent and
outgoings paid by Beaumont was for the month of June, $13,339.23 and for the
period 1 July 2024 to 31 January 2025 (accepting
PRYV’s table of payments
produced to the Tribunal), $58,763.25 a total of $72,102.48. With Beaumont
liable to pay $78,486.31
and having paid $72,102.48 there is a shortfall of
$6,383.83 due to PRYV for the period ending 31 January 2025.
[67] PRYV stated
it engaged a valuer on 12 February 2025 to assess market rent which was assessed
by such valuer at $16,250.00 plus
GST. Outgoings were assessed at $2,004.39 plus
GST per month. The registered lease provided for a market rent review on 1
2025 with market rent to be as agreed between lessor and lessee or as
determined by a licensed valuer. There was no evidence before
the Tribunal of
agreement about market rent or agreement about the appointment of a licensed
valuer nor about any such licensed valuer
notifying the lessor or lessee about
acceptance of the any appointment. The Tribunal does not intend to comment on
that matter further
other than to say it is incumbent on both lessor and lessee
to follow the market rent assessment procedure in the registered lease
to arrive at market rent as at and applicable from 1 February 2025.
[68] Beaumont
claimed losses because of the lockout and ongoing disruption of trade. Its claim
is confined to that set out in its
schedule of claim totalling $203,785 filed 30
January 2025 made up of
A Costs incurred during the lockout period without sales revenue -
$82,709.00.
B Loss of normal operating profit (after costs) during the lockout period -
$35,092.00.
C Direct overhead costs during the lockout period - $14,463.00.
D Consequential loss of profit for the period to 31 December 2024 - $71,521.00.
[69] Whilst
Beaumont was willing to engage an independent auditor to review the calculation
to review its calculation it did not do
so to date. Beaumont was given ample
opportunity to present its best evidence but did not do so. The lockout period
was 57 trading
days over a total period of 67 days from 13 June 2024 to 18
August 2024 (Beaumont was allowed access on Monday 19 August 2024).
claim was for 56 days representing a slight understatement of
Calculation of lost profits during the lockout period based on Beaumont’s
data is as follows.
Average daily sales in lead up to lockout was $6,558.00.
Average net profit in lead up to lockout was 9.555% ($35,092.00 divided by
$367,276.00), which is equal to $626.62 per trading day.
Lost profit over 56 trading days claimed by Beaumont is $35,092.00.
But wages of $72,121.00 continued to be paid during the lockout period in order
to maintain staff when lockout period ended and needs
to be added to lost
Beaumont claimed depreciation over the lockout period. The Tribunal does not
accept such because it is a sunk cost. It would have
been incurred whether the
shop was open or not.
Beaumont also saved $55,742.00by not paying/incurring rent, advertising,
cleaning/waste, electricity, and freight. That sum should
have been deducted
from its claim, but it was not.
Therefore, total lost profits during the lockout period were $51,471.00
($35,092.00 plus $72,121.00 less $55,742.00).
[71] The claim
for direct overhead expenses during the lockout period of $14,463.00 is
disallowed because such expenses would have
been incurred whether the lockout
occurred or not. The uncertainty over the lost $51,471.00 during the lockout
period is that Beaumont
failed to demonstrate whether its next closest Beaumont
Tiles store (at Bundall, 9.5 kilometres to the south) achieved higher sales
during the lockout period. To the extent that lost sales were transferred to the
Bundall store, then those sales were not lost to
Beaumont. That is an unknown. A
discount factor ought properly to be applied to recognise this circumstance even
though there was
no evidence about any such factor. Some sales would have been
retained by the Beaumont Tiles Group. In the absence of such evidence
Tribunal considers a discount factor ought to apply. Adoption of a 30% discount
would seem commercially reasonable.
[72] During the
post – lockout period to 31 December 2024 actual sales were $371,475 .00
compared to $518,121.00 if the pre-lockout
sales level was maintained,
representing lost sales of $146,646.00. A gross margin of 48.8% was applied to
arrive at $71,521.00.
The Tribunal agrees with this calculation. The continuing
low daily sales level over the whole period from reopening to December
suggests that lower trading levels continued beyond December 2024 (but not
claimed by Beaumont). However, there was no evidence
to rule out other factors
occurring in the local market to influence the lower sales level. These other
factors could include the
opening of competition in the local area, declining
housing construction in the general locality of the subject premises (building
approvals on the Gold Coast fell by 15% in 2024/25 compared to 2023/24), or
supply chain issues in the industry.
[73] In summary
the Tribunal allows the claim for lost profits during the lockout period of
$51,471.00 less a discount factor of 30%
to arrive at compensation of
$36,030.00. The claim for post lockout period is not allowed for the reason
there is too much uncertainty
over other possible factors affecting sales.
[74] Taking into
account the rent shortfall of $6,383.83 the final compensation sum available to
Beaumont is $29,646.17.
