DECISION UNDER APPEAL:
Nylund v City of Canada Bay Council
(W3774/25, 11 August
Mr J Turner
DATE OF MEMBER’S DECISION:
11 August 2025
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Nylund (the worker/respondent) worked with the City of Canada Bay Council (the
Council/appellant) as a gymnastics coach from
June 2020. From 26 October 2020 he
had the role of Sports Program Team Leader, which involved managing the
gymnastic coaching program
at Five Dock Leisure Centre and the supervision of
approximately 25 coaching staff. The worker had extensive achievements in
and coaching.
claimed lump sum compensation in respect of 22 per cent whole person impairment
for a psychological injury,
expressed to result from personal injury and disease injury in the alternative.
The Council’s insurer, StateCover, disputed
liability relying on s 11A of
Workers Compensation Act 1987
(the 1987 Act) and additionally denying
the worker suffered from relevant
incapacity.
The pleaded injury
relies on the actions of the Council from 1 August 2022 to 19 May 2023,
with a deemed date of 19 May 2023.
matter was listed for hearing before Member Turner on 24 July 2025. Mr Dodd
appeared for the worker and Mr P Perry appeared for
the Council. The Member
dealt with applications for leave to lodge additional documents, dated 15 July
2025 (on the worker’s
part) and 24 April 2025, 8 July 2025 and 18
July 2025 (on the Council’s part).
Member dealt with the contested admission of the worker’s Application
dated 15 July 2025 (the contested Application) in
an interlocutory written
decision dated 11 August 2025.
THE INTERLOCUTORY DECISION UNDER APPEAL
Member noted the contested Application consisted of a statement from the worker
dated 15 July 2025 together with the following
(a) Gymnastics Australia Complaints, Disputes and Discipline Policy;
(b) Workplace Behavioural Standards and Expectations Policy;
(c) Email from [redacted] providing prior written consent for [redacted];
(d) Email from [redacted] providing prior written consent for [redacted], and
(e) Local Government State Award.
Member said the worker responded to statements by a number of people. The Member
referred to the Council’s submission that
there was no reason why the
material in the contested Application could not have been served
previously.
Member, at [13] of the reasons, dealt with the Council’s objections to
multiple paragraphs of the worker’s statement
dated 3 April 2025. The
Member noted there were over 2,000 pages of evidence in the matter, riddled with
references to policies and
alleged breaches of policy. The Member by and large
rejected the multiple objections taken by the Council. This earlier statement
not that at issue in the interlocutory appeal before me.
Member referred to r 67C(4) of the Personal Commission Rules 2021 (the Rules),
pursuant to which leave could be given for the
admission of a document if it was
“necessary to facilitate the just, quick and cost effective resolution of
the real issues
in the proceedings”. The Member said the Application was
“on the whole relevant to the matters in dispute”. He
documents did not “raise any new issues nor diverge from the existing
evidence such that the [Council] has not had
the opportunity to previously
consider and investigate”. He concluded:
[Council] would not be prejudiced by the admission of the additional documents
into evidence and that it is in the
interests of a just, quick and cost
effective resolution of the matter that the documents be admitted into
Member admitted the contested
Application.
ON THE PAPERS
52(3) of the
Personal Injury Commission Act 2020
(the 2020 Act)
“(3) If the Commission is satisfied that
sufficient information has been supplied to it in connection with proceedings,
Commission may exercise functions under this Act and enabling legislation
without holding any conference or formal hearing.”
regard to Procedural Directions PIC2 and WC3; the documents that are before me,
and the submissions by both parties that the
appeal can proceed to be determined
on the basis of these documents, I am satisfied that I have sufficient
information to proceed
‘on the papers’ without holding any
conference or formal hearing and that this is the appropriate course in the
circumstances.
THE LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS
352(3) of the
Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act
(the 1998 Act) provides:
“(3) There is no
appeal under this section unless the amount of compensation at issue on the
appeal is both—
(a) at least $5,000 (or such other amount as may be prescribed by the
regulations), and
(b) at least 20% of the amount awarded in the decision appealed against.”
352(4) of the 1998 Act provides:
“(4) The appeal must be
made within—
(a) 28 days after the decision appealed against is made, or
(b) a longer period determined or allowed, whether generally or for the kind of
proceedings, in accordance with the Commission rules.”
352(3A) of the 1998 Act provides:
“(3A) There is no
appeal under this section against an interlocutory decision except with the
leave of the Commission. The
Commission is not to grant leave unless of the
opinion that determining the appeal is necessary or desirable for the proper and
determination of the dispute.”
67C of the Rules relevantly provides:
“(3) An additional
document may also be introduced in applicable proceedings by a party—
(i) the party applies to the appropriate decision-maker for leave to
introduce the document, and
(ii) the document complies with rule 67(1) and is served and lodged in
accordance with subrule (1), and
(iii) the appropriate decision-maker gives leave, or
(b) if the appropriate decision-maker otherwise gives leave on the
application of the party.
(4) The appropriate decision-maker may give leave if satisfied the
introduction of the document is necessary to facilitate the just,
quick and cost
effective resolution of the real issues in the proceedings.”
42 of the 2020 Act provides:
principle to be applied to practice and procedure
guiding principle
for this Act and the Commission
rules, in their application to proceedings in the Commission, is to facilitate
the just, quick and
cost effective resolution of the real issues in the
proceedings.
(2) The Commission must seek to give effect to the guiding principle
(a) exercises any power given to it by this Act or the Commission
(b) interprets any provision of this Act or the Commission rules.
(3) Each of the following persons is under a duty to co-operate with
the Commission to give effect to the guiding principle and,
for that purpose, to
participate in the processes of the Commission and to comply with directions and
orders of the Commission—
(a) a party to proceedings in the Commission,
(b) an Australian legal practitioner or other person who is
representing a party in proceedings in the Commission.
(4) In addition, the practice and procedure of the Commission should be
implemented so as to facilitate the resolution of the issues
between the parties
in such a way that the cost to the parties and the Commission is proportionate
to the importance and complexity
of the subject-matter of the proceedings.
(5) However, nothing in this section requires or permits the Commission
to exercise any functions that are conferred or imposed on
it under enabling
legislation in a manner that is inconsistent with the objects or principles for
which that legislation provides
in relation to the exercise of those
functions.”
73 of the Rules provides:
principles for applicable proceedings
The appropriate decision-maker for applicable proceedings must, when
informing itself or themselves on any matter in the proceedings,
have regard to
the following principles—
(a) evidence should be logical and probative,
(b) evidence should be relevant to the facts in issue and the issues in
(c) evidence based on speculation or unsubstantiated assumptions is
unacceptable,
(d) unqualified opinions are unacceptable.”
THRESHOLD MATTERS
worker disputes that the threshold requirements as to quantum and time pursuant
to ss 352(3) and 352(4) of the 1998 Act have been
Was the appeal within time?
Worker’s submissions
worker disputes that the appeal was filed within time. The worker submits time
to file this interlocutory appeal expired on 8
September 2025. The Council
attempted to file an appeal on that day however it was rejected by a Delegate of
the President as it
was not procedurally compliant. The worker submits a further
attempt to file the appeal on 9 September 2025 failed as the Council
comply with procedural directions. The Council’s Application to Appeal was
successfully registered on 10 September
2025, although it did not contain an
application for leave to appeal out of time, or submissions in compliance with s
133A, contrary
to earlier correspondence from the Delegate of the President. The
worker submits this appeal should be dismissed due to its non-compliance
352(4) of the 1998 Act.
Council’s submissions
Council disputes the worker’s version of events leading to registration of
the appeal. It submits the appeal was filed on
8 September 2025, within time,
although the appeal did not achieve “full technical compliance with the
Commission’s requirements”.
It submits an email from the Commission
dated 9 September 2025 gave it until 5 pm on 10 September 2025 to file and
relodge the appeal
or it would be rejected. The Council submits it lodged
amended submissions on 10 September 2025 which were accepted and sealed on
date. It disputes that the appeal was not made within
Consideration
delegate of the President wrote to the Council’s solicitors on 8 September
2025. The letter stated that the Appeal Application
lodged on that date
“has been rejected”. It gave reasons that referred to Procedural
Direction WC3:
(a) the appeal did not address each ground separately;
(b) it did not include submissions on the monetary threshold;
(c) it did not include a list of authorities, and
(d) it did not attach a chronology.
letter informed the Council that it “may lodge a fresh appeal application
that complies with Procedural Direction WC3”.
The Commission’s
records indicate the appeal was relodged, with amendment, on 8 September 2025 at
3.55 pm, within time. The
Commission did not reject the appeal. By email it
requested that the Council lodge submissions by 5 pm on 10 September 2025
each ground of appeal separately. The Commission informed the Council
that failure to lodge compliant amended submissions may result
in the appeal
being rejected. This process was consistent with the operation of cl 10 of
Procedural Direction WC3. Amended submissions
were lodged. The appeal was
registered on 10 September 2025. The date of registration is not
necessarily the date of lodgement.
above sequence of events is consistent with the Council’s submissions. The
appeal was lodged on 8 September 2025 at 3.55
pm. It was within time.
Was the monetary threshold satisfied?
worker refers to the monetary requirements in s 352(3) of the 1998 Act. What is
at issue on this appeal is the admission of additional
documentary evidence. The
worker submits a decision on whether the monetary threshold in s 352(3) is
satisfied would be “entirely
speculative”, an issue that is not
assisted by any submissions from the Council.

Grimson v Integral

entitlement pursuant to s 66 of the 1987 Act. It
follows that the threshold in s
352(3) of the 1998 Act is satisfied.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Council raises the following grounds of appeal:
(a) “The [Member] erred in granting the [worker] leave to lodge additional
documents following the [worker’s] application
to do so dated 15 July
2025, in the absence of the [worker’s] failure to provide an explanation
for the delay or any evidence
of compliance with [rule] 67(3)(a). This was an
error of law and an error of discretion.” (Ground No. 1)
(b) “The [M]ember erred in concluding that to permit the introduction of
the evidence contained in the application was not
prejudicial to the [Council].
This was an error of law.” (Ground No. 2)
(c) “The [M]ember erred by failing to deal with a key aspect of the
[Council’s] submissions in relation to prejudice
and, in doing so,
committed an error of law and a constructive error of jurisdiction.”
(Ground No. 3)
(d) “The [M]ember erred by failing to apply the principles outlined in
clause 28 of [Procedural Direction] PIC 3 and in decisions
Woolstar Pty Limited v Draper
[2024] NSWPICPD 72
, when making his
determination on the admissibility of the late evidence from the [worker]. This
was an error of law and an error
of discretion. It also amounted to inadequacy
of reasons.” (Ground No. 4)
COUNCIL’S SUBMISSIONS
Ground No. 1
Council submits the Application at issue was filed and served by the worker on
15 July 2025, nine days prior to the hearing date
and about nine weeks after
statements from five of the Council’s six lay witnesses. It submits the
further lay evidence was
not presaged by the worker at the preliminary
conference on 13 May 2025. It submits there was no explanation for this delay
evidence that the documents were recently acquired by the worker. It
submits admission of the late documents was erroneous and leave
to appeal should
be granted.
Ground No. 2
Council submits Mr Male (the Council’s co-ordinator of people and
was overseas and
unavailable to respond to assertions about him in the worker’s statement
dated 15 July 2025 (part of the disputed
Application). The Council submits this
statement of the worker referred to emails which the Council needed to verify
and, if appropriate,
place in context. It submits this prejudice was erroneously
dismissed by the Member.
Council refers to the Member’s reasons at subparagraphs (ii) and (ix) of
paragraph [13]. The Member said the Council’s
policies and alleged
breaches of them were a matter for him, not the opinion of Mr Male.
Council submits it had produced evidence that the worker was afforded procedural
fairness which arguably established the reasonableness
of its actions for the
purposes of its s 11A defence. The Council’s submissions at [25] to [28]
go more to the merits of this
defence rather than to exercise of the
Member’s discretion to admit the disputed Application.
Council submits it was entitled to a reasonable opportunity to respond to
allegations of its alleged breaches of its own policies
and the industrial
award, which went to the reasonableness of its actions. The Council submits it
had obtained a supplementary statement
from Mr Wolfe, the Council’s
Director of Community, Culture and Leisure, which was served on the day of the
earlier hearing.
It had not been able to get further instructions from Mr Male
(who was overseas) or Ms Rogic, Acting Manager People and Culture (who

constructive error of jurisdiction”. It refers to

Member’s reasons at [15] where it was said that the additional evidence
did “not raise any new issues

Ground No. 4
Council quotes from the decision of
Woolstar Pty Ltd v
in which Parker SC
ADP dealt with the exercise of the discretion pursuant to r 67(4). The Council
is critical of the Member’s
reasons. The Council submits there has not
been timely resolution of the dispute because the Member’s determination

referred to Procedural Direction PIC3 in its form as at 6 November

The Council’s
submissions, to the extent to which they rely on
Procedural Direction in its earlier form, must be treated with caution.)
Council submits the requirements of subrr 67(3) and (4) are not the subject of
meaningful analysis by the Member. It submits the
reasons for delay were not
articulated by the worker. It submits the Member failed to act “according
to equity, good conscience
and the substantial merits of the case without regard
to technicalities or legal
WORKER’S SUBMISSIONS
Ground No. 1
worker submits the hearing would not have concluded on the date of hearing, 24
July 2025. There were 2,262 pages of evidence,
plus possible evidence from lay
witnesses on both sides. It submits the exercise of determining whether

on an interlocutory basis would affect the proper
and effective determination of the dispute is “entirely
speculative”.

Admit Late Documents by no later than three
working days before the hearing.
This it did. The worker submits there was no delay that required further

worker submits the reference to the policies identified by Mr Male was not new

Ms Rogic was available on one hour’s notice on the
hearing date, and other evidence could be adduced from the Council’s
Resources Division.
Ground No. 3

Application which, in determining the
case, would be considered with the other
evidence. This other evidence involved the ARD lodged by the worker (350 pages),
lodged by the Council (499 pages), and three Late Documents
Applications lodged by the Council (24 April 2025 – 1,320 pages),
2025 (13 pages) and 18 July 2025 (72 pages). The worker was to be cross-examined
and four other people (employees and ex-employees
of the Council) had been
required to give evidence. Submissions regarding the disputed Application were
continuing at 3.32 pm on
24 July, 2025, the first hearing date. There was
no way the hearing would complete that day. The worker submitted it would be
for the Member to form a view on whether the disputed application
(139 pages) was necessary or desirable for the proper determination

filed by both parties. The worker submitted

The Council’s submissions in reply
Council submitted its original submissions identified multiple ways in which
admission of the material, in the disputed Application,
exposed it to
“real prejudice”. It submitted the proper and effective
determination of a dispute could not take place
where a party is exposed to
“real prejudice” through the admission of material, if one party was
“under prejudice”
and denied procedural fairness. It submitted that
if the additional documents were admitted there could be no proper and effective
determination of the dispute.
Consideration of the leave issue
Licul v Corney
Gibbs J dealt with the test to establish whether a
judgment was final or interlocutory, saying:
“The other view
which, since
Hall v Nominal Defendant
should, I think, be regarded as
established in Australia, depends on the nature of the order made; the test is:
Does the judgment
or order, as made, finally dispose of the rights of the
above test has been frequently applied in the Commission, and in the former
Workers Compensation Commission of New South Wales,
over many years. The
Member’s decision dealing with admission of the disputed Application was
plainly interlocutory. The Council
requires leave pursuant to s 352(3A) if its
appeal is to proceed. The basis for consideration of whether leave is
appropriate is
whether exercise of the discretion is “necessary or
desirable for the proper and effective determination of the dispute.”
Council’s appeal challenges the Member’s exercise of discretion in
the admission of late documents. The Council has
not challenged the
worker’s observation going to the sheer bulk of material already lodged by
the parties (see [43] above).
The Council basically submits that admission of
the disputed Application causes prejudice and denies it procedural fairness.
reflects its substantive arguments in the interlocutory appeal. It
effectively argues that if it is entitled to succeed in the appeal
substantive grounds then leave should be granted.

The class of such
cases is not closed, it depends on the circumstances of the particular matter.
Interlocutory
appeals, by their nature, tend to slow down the determination of disputes. The
‘guiding principle’ in s
42(1) of the 2020 Act is that the 2020 Act
and the Rules should facilitate “the just, quick and cost effective
resolution of
the real issues in the proceedings”. Rule 67C(4) (which the
Member applied) provides for admission of an additional document
decision-maker is “satisfied the introduction of the document is necessary
to facilitate the just, quick and cost effective
resolution of the real issues
in the proceedings”. Satisfaction of the ‘guiding principle’
is not assisted by interlocutory
appeals. Section 352(3A) provides a discretion
that may be exercised where it is “necessary or desirable for the proper
effective determination of the dispute”, whilst otherwise prohibiting
a Presidential appeal against an interlocutory decision.
It is, of course,
potentially possible in any event for the Council to appeal the Member’s
discretionary decision on admission
of the disputed Application, after the final
decision in the matter.

the High Court quoted the following
In Re the Will
, “with approval”:
"... I am of opinion
that, ... there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a
point of practice or procedure
and an exercise of discretion which determines
substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept

be disastrous to the proper administration of justice.
The disposal of cases

disposition could, at will, in effect transfer
all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in
to a Court of Appeal."
