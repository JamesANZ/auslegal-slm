The application
1. The respondent was charged with two counts of making a false
accusation of an offence to police (contrary to s 715 of the Criminal
(ACT)) and three counts of public mischief (contrary to
(ACT) (Crimes Act)).
2. On 26 August 2015, the Chief Magistrate found
the offences “proved”, and endorsed each bench sheet “offence
On this application, the parties accepted that, in finding that
the charges were proved, the Magistrates Court made findings of guilt.
3. The Chief Magistrate did not use the word “convict”. The
matter was adjourned for sentence on 30 October 2015. We infer
accordance with common practice, the Chief Magistrate declined to use the word
“convict” because her Honour
wished to leave open the possibility
that she may sentence the respondent by making a “non-conviction
order” under
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
(ACT) (Sentencing
4. The sentencing hearing did not proceed because, on 23 September
2015, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal against her conviction.
Magistrates Court Act 1930
(ACT) (MCA) provides that, if a person
appeals against conviction, the conviction is stayed until the appeal is
5. The respondent considered that, as the Magistrates Court had
found that the offences were proved, there was a right to appeal because
enables a “person convicted” to appeal against the
“conviction”, and (as the respondent reasoned) the term
“conviction” includes a finding of guilt.
6. The applicant (the
informant in the Magistrates Court) applied under r 5172(1) of the
Procedures Rules 2006
(ACT) (CPR) to strike out the appeal as incompetent,
contending that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction under s 208(1)(b) of the
MCA to entertain an appeal against a finding of guilt because a finding of guilt
does not amount to a “conviction”.
7. The issue is whether, for
the purposes of s 208(1)(b) of the MCA, a finding that an offence is proved (a
finding of guilt) is a
“conviction” which renders an offender a
“person convicted”. If it is, then the appeal is
8. Pursuant to
Supreme Court Act 1933
(ACT) (SCA)
the question of whether the appeal is competent was referred by a single judge
to the Full Court. As the Court observed
in Legal Practitioner v Council of the
Law Society of the ACT
[2014] ACTSC 256
, “the discretion [to refer
a matter to the Full Court] may be enlivened where a matter involved an
important question of principle
or a matter of public importance.” This
matter involves both questions.
General principles
9. An appeal is not a creature of the common law, but a right
conferred by statute (in this case, the MCA). When deciding the nature
appeal right it is necessary to closely examine the relevant statute: Walsh v
Law Society of New Wales
[1999] HCA 33
(1999) 198 CLR 73
per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ at
[50]; Byrnes v The Queen
[1999] HCA 38
(1999) 199 CLR 1
per Kirby J at [84]; Lacey v
Attorney-General (Qld)
[2011] HCA 10
(2011) 242 CLR 573
per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan,
Kiefel and Bell JJ at [57].
10. Statutory construction requires the Court to
take a textual and purposive approach: Project Blue Sky Inc v ABC
(1998) 194 CLR
11. Chapter 14 of the
Legislation Act 2001
(ACT) (Legislation Act)
guides the interpretation of ACT Acts and statutory instruments, but it is not a
comprehensive statement
of the law of interpretation:
Legislation
Section 139(1)
Legislation Act
relevantly provides that
“[i]n working out the meaning of an Act, the interpretation that would
best achieve the purpose of
the Act is to be preferred to any other
interpretation.” Section 138 provides that:
out the meaning of an Act
(a) resolving an ambiguous or obscure provision of the Act; or
(b) confirming or displacing the apparent meaning of the Act; or
(c) finding the meaning of the Act when its apparent meaning leads to a
result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable; or
(d) finding the meaning of the Act in any other case.
13. In relation to (c), in Eastman v Besanko
[2010] ACTCA 15
(2010) 244 FLR
, relying on the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (6th ed, 2007), at [88] Dowsett J
opined that:
word “unreasonable” means “(n)ot endowed with reason;
irrational ... . Not based on or acting in accordance
with reason or good
Section 140
Legislation Act
provides that,
“[i]n working out the meaning of an Act, the provisions of the Act must be
read in the context of the Act as
Section 141
Legislation Act
provides that:
(1) In working out the meaning of an Act,
material not forming part of the Act may be considered.
deciding whether material not forming part of an Act should be considered in
working out the meaning of the Act, and the weight
to be given to the material,
the following matters must be taken into account:
(a) the desirability of being able to rely on the ordinary meaning of the
Act, having regard to the purpose of the Act and the provisions
of the Act read
in the context of the Act as a whole;
(b) the undesirability of prolonging proceedings without compensating
(c) the accessibility of the material to the public.
Materials that do not form part of an Act include notes and
certain headings:
Legislation Act
of the Dictionary
Legislation Act
contains definitions of terms that are commonly used in
Acts, but contains no definition of “conviction”. It does contain
the following definition of “found guilty”:
found guilty
of an offence, includes—
(a) having an order made for the offence under the
Crimes (Sentencing) Act
(Non-conviction orders—general); and
(b) having the offence taken into account under the
Crimes (Sentencing)
(Outstanding additional offences taken into account in
sentencing).
Human Rights Act 2004
(ACT) (HRA) is also relevant to
interpreting Territory laws.
Section 30(1)
of the HRA provides that a law of
the Territory “must be interpreted in a way that is compatible with human
so far as it is possible to do so.
Does “conviction” have an “ordinary
18. The applicant submitted that the “ordinary
meaning” of “conviction” is the formal entry of a conviction,
and the rejection of the possibility that a non-conviction order will be made.
The applicant submitted that there is a well-recognised
difference between a
“finding of guilt” (in effect, a finding that an offence has been
proved) and a “conviction”;
a conviction can be entered only after a
finding of guilt, but a finding of guilt does not necessarily result in the
entry of a conviction.
19. Decisions concerning the meaning of
“conviction” in other legislation cannot determine the meaning of
“conviction”
as used in the MCA. As McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ
said in McNamara (McGrath) v Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal
[2005] HCA 55
(2005) 221 CLR
, “[i]t would be an error to treat what was said in construing
one statute as necessarily controlling the construction of another.”
20. However, some guidance may be obtained from the common law and from
decisions interpreting the word “conviction” in
legislation.
21. At common law, the term “conviction” has a
“wide and somewhat equivocal meaning”: Travini v Starczewski
[2009] ACTSC 123
169 ACTR 1 (Travini)
. The answer to the question of what amounts to a
conviction depends upon the context in which the question is asked: Maxwell v
Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 per Dawson and McHugh JJ at 507.
22. In Davies v
[1933] HCA 64
(1933) 50 CLR 379 (Davies
v Ryan), the High Court (Evatt J) considered
whether an order of dismissal made under the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance
2) 1930 (ACT) (Ordinance No. 2) (the predecessor to the MCA) could be
appealed to the High Court. Section 207 of Ordinance No. 2
High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from all
rulings, orders, convictions or determinations of the
Section 208 of Ordinance No. 2 provided:
Any party to any proceedings in
the Court [of Petty Sessions] who is aggrieved by or dissatisfied with an order
or conviction of the
Court may ... apply to the High Court for leave to appeal
to the High Court against such order or conviction.
At 382, Evatt J decided that there was a right to appeal an
order of dismissal. In reaching that conclusion, his Honour observed
heading to the relevant part of the legislation referred to appeals from
“decisions” of the Court of Petty Sessions,
and said that
“decision” was a term of wide import. His Honour noted that, in s
207 of the Ordinance No. 2, appellate
“all rulings, orders, convictions or determinations” of the Court of
Petty Sessions.
23. In Cobiac v Liddy
[1969] HCA 26
(1969) 119 CLR 257
, the appellant,
who had a prior conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, came
before a magistrate for another such
offence. For a “second
offence” of that type, the “penalty” was a mandatory minimum
period of imprisonment.
The magistrate found the new offence to be proved but,
“without convicting” the appellant, he “dismissed”
charge. One issue before the High Court was whether the magistrate had been
obliged to impose the mandatory penalty. Barwick
CJ, Kitto and Owen JJ held
that the magistrate had been entitled to dismiss the new charge without imposing
a mandatory penalty because,
in the particular statutory context, there had been
no conviction for the new charge.
24. Windeyer J reached the same
conclusion. In so doing, his Honour placed reliance on the association between
the expressions “without
convicting” and “dismissed”.
At 271–3 Windeyer J discussed the various meanings that may be
accorded to
the term “conviction”. His Honour noted that, at common
law, there was a distinction between “conviction”
“judgment”, and a person who was found guilty and bound over to come
up for judgment when called upon (rather than
merely bound over to be of good
behaviour) was “convicted”. It followed that not everyone who was
“convicted”
was sentenced, but a person could not be punished unless
he or she had been convicted first.
25. A similar problem led to a different
outcome in Price v Police
[2008] SASC 119.
In that case, the Court considered
whether a motor vehicle offence in respect of which no conviction had been
recorded should be
taken into account in determining whether a later motor
vehicle offence was a “subsequent offence”. The answer to that
question depended upon the meaning of the word “convicted”. Kelly J
found that, having regard to the intent and policy
of the relevant legislation,
an offence for which no conviction had been recorded was to be taken into
account in determining whether
an offence was a “subsequent
offence”. At [18] his Honour said:
is trite to state that the word “conviction” must take its meaning
from the context in which it appears. The term “conviction”
ambiguous term, sometimes used in the narrow sense as indicating merely that a
person has been made the subject of a finding
of guilt and sometimes used in the
wider sense of the finding of guilt combined with the sentence of the court.
Without a determination
of guilt, there can be no conviction, however the
converse does not necessarily apply because a determination of guilt will not in
all cases amount to a conviction:
Attorney General v
(2002) TASSC 10
per Crawford J.
26. In Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor
Wholesale Pty Ltd
(2003) 216 CLR 161
, the High Court was asked to determine the
standard of proof required to enter a conviction for unlawful failure to pay
certain customs
and excise duties, contrary to the
Customs Act 1901
(Customs Act) and the
Excise Act 1901
Section 248
Customs Act
provided that there was a right to appeal “from any conviction
order”. Hayne J observed that, when considering this
question, focus
should be placed upon the types of order which are to be made in the
proceedings; in that case, a “conviction”.
Hayne J (with whom
Gleeson CJ and McHugh J agreed) observed, at [137], that:
[t]he word [conviction] has
long been recognised as being used in various ways. In particular, there may
well be a question whether
conviction depends upon verdict or plea, or upon the
sentence of the court. What is clear, however, is that where the
Customs Act
speak of ‘‘conviction’’ they speak of an
adjudication by the court that the defendant has contravened a provision
Act. The adjudication sought is in no relevant way different from the
adjudication that occurs when a person accused of crime
pleads guilty to, or is
found guilty of, that crime, and the court accepts or determines that the
accused is criminally responsible
for that offence.
(Footnotes omitted)
At [138], his Honour concluded that, before there could be a
“conviction”, “the requisite elements of the contravening
conduct” must be established beyond reasonable doubt.
27. In NSW, it
is well accepted that in the case of a jury trial, for the purposes of the
Criminal Appeal Act 1912
(NSW), a person is “convicted” when the
jury returns a verdict of guilty: R v MAJW
[2007] NSWCCA 145
(2007) 171 A Crim R 407.
Hinton v The Queen
[2000] FCA 1019
(2000) 177 ALR 300
, the Federal Court distinguished the right
to appeal against a jury verdict under
Federal Court of Australia
(Cth) from the position in New South Wales and Victoria. At [15], the
Court said:
term “conviction” has sometimes been understood, in context, to mean
the complete orders made by a court after finding
an accused person guilty of an
offence. These orders will include both the finding of guilt and the sentence
passed as a consequence.
(Citations omitted)
29. There is a line of South Australian cases dealing with s
163 of the Justices Act 1921 (SA), which provided that “there shall
appeal to the Supreme Court from every conviction, order and adjudication of the
court of summary jurisdiction” (emphasis
added). Those cases hold that, in
the context of s 163, the expression “conviction” meant the final
adjudication of the
court, including the penalty: Peters v Lawson
(1980) 23 SASR
On the other hand, in Fry v Jennings
(1983) 25 NTR 19
, the Court held that
s 163 of the
Justices Act 1928
(NT), which provides for an appeal from a
“conviction, order, or adjudication” (emphasis added), permits an
appeal from
a finding that a charge is proved on the basis that such a finding
is an “adjudication”.
30. In Rail Infrastructure Corporation v
[2008] NSWIRComm 169
(2008) 179 IR 398
, the appellant had been “found guilty” of an
offence. The NSW Industrial Relations Commission considered
Criminal Appeal Act 1912
(NSW), which enables a person “convicted of an
offence” by the Supreme Court exercising summary jurisdiction to appeal
“against the conviction (including any sentence imposed)...”. The
Commission observed that, in the context of
, “conviction” and
“sentence” are discrete concepts: at [17]. The Commission concluded
that, where there
has been a plea of not guilty, a merits hearing, the giving of
reasons and a finding of guilt, there is a “conviction”
purposes of
The Commission observed that more recent authorities
suggested that “conviction” does not require the formal announcement
or recording of a conviction: at [39].
31. In Eastman v Director of Public
Prosecutions [No 2]
[2014] ACTSCFC 2
(2014) 9 ACTLR 178
, the Court considered the meaning of
“conviction” in s 430 and
(which deals with
inquiries into convictions). At [33], the Court said:
our opinion, when used in
, the word “conviction”, applying as
it does both to summary trials and trials on indictment, simply means the
by the tribunal of fact (magistrate, judge or jury) that the person is
guilty of the relevant offence.
32. As these cases illustrate, the word
“conviction” has no “ordinary meaning”; it may be used
in a narrow
way to refer to a finding of guilt (that an offence has been proved)
or it may be used in the broadest sense, as meaning that criminal
proceedings
have been finalised in that the offender has been sentenced. However, it is
worth noting that the Court was referred
to no case concerning the right to
appeal from a “conviction” in which “conviction” was
held to mean the
formal pronouncement or formal recording of a conviction.
Section 208(1)(c)
Magistrates Court Act
Part 3.10.1
MCA, which is entitled “Criminal appeals—jurisdiction of Supreme
Court”, contains only
Section 207
(1) The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in relation to decisions
of the Magistrates Court under this Act (other than chapter
proceedings))
extends to the hearing and deciding of the following appeals

(b) reference appeals under division 3.10.2A (Reference appeals in criminal
(c) review appeals under division 3.10.3 (Review appeals in criminal
(Emphasis added)
34. As Penfold J noted in Bloxham v Wyte
[2013] ACTSC 151
(2013) 278 FLR 365
, the introductory words emphasise that there must be an
adequate statutory basis from which to infer the availability of an appeal
the Magistrates Court to the Supreme Court. See also Burow v The Queen
35. Section 208(1) of the MCA lists the criminal decisions
from which there is an appeal right. In part, it provides for:
(b) an appeal, by the
person convicted
for an offence dealt with by
the Magistrates Court under this Act, part 3.6 (Proceedings for offences
punishable summarily) or part
3.7 (Service and pleading by post for certain
offences) or under the
, section 374 or section 375;
(c) an appeal, by the person against whom the
is made, from an
under this Act, section 113 or section 114 in a proceeding
dealt with by the Magistrates Court under this Act, part 3.6 or under the
, section 374 or section 375;
(Emphasis added)
Sections 113
of the MCA concern the outcome of
proceedings on information. Sections 374 and 375 of the
concern the
summary disposal of indictable matters.
36. Although neither party submitted
that a finding that an offence is proved is an “order” within the
s 208(1)(c)
of the MCA conferring a right of appeal under that
provision, as both parties referred to
s 208(1)(c)
in their submissions, we will
refer briefly to
s 208(1)(c)
before we turn to consider
s 208(1)(b).
declining to rely on
s 208(1)(c)
of the MCA, the applicant adopted the reasoning
of Penfold J in Bloxham where, at [35]–[46], her Honour discussed whether
finding of guilt was an “order” within the meaning of
s 208(1)(c)
of the MCA. Her Honour concluded that, while a finding of guilt may be a
pre-requisite to the making of an “order”, it
is not itself an
“order”. At [45], her Honour said:
is, “order”, absent any extended meaning given by a definition,
seems to require something that, in very general
terms, requires or causes
something to be done or to happen — something more than a mere finding
that certain things are the
38. The respondent accepted that a finding of guilt is not an
“order” within the meaning of
s 208(1)(c)
of the MCA, but for a
different reason. The respondent noted that
distinguish between a “conviction” (the alternative outcome to a
dismissal) and an “order” (an
outcome that differs in nature from a
“conviction” or “dismissal”). The respondent submitted
that, in a similar
distinguishes between a conviction outcome (a
finding of guilt) and an order outcome.
39. A consideration of the way in
which the MCA deals with the commencement of criminal proceedings may lend
support to the respondent’s
approach. In the MCA, all criminal proceedings
are commenced by information: s 25 of the MCA. The Dictionary to the MCA
“information” to include a complaint brought to enforce a
criminal penalty or forfeiture.
Section 208
may be designed to be consistent
with s 25 and with
in that all the provisions recognise the
difference between a conviction outcome (the outcome of an information that
charges a criminal
offence) and an order outcome (the outcome of an information
that is a complaint brought to enforce a criminal penalty or forfeiture),
provide for an appeal from each outcome.
40. In Travini at [32], Refshauge J
observed that the reference to “order” in
may relate to the
historical entitlement of the Magistrates Court to make an order upon a
defendant to a civil proceeding commenced
by complaint, rather than (as we have
observed in the preceding paragraph) to the different types of outcome that may
occur in criminal
proceedings (conviction/ dismissal) and criminal penalty/
forfeiture enforcement proceedings (an order).
41. In any event, neither
party submitted that
s 208(1)(c)
of the MCA confers a right to appeal from a
finding that an offence is proved (a finding of guilt).
“Conviction” in the
Magistrates Court Act
42. “Conviction” is defined in the Dictionary to
the MCA in a manner that is unhelpful for present purposes. It provides:
(a) means conviction by a magistrate for an offence; and
(b) for division 3.9.3 (Reciprocal enforcement of fines against bodies
corporate)—see
section 166A.
43. In Travini, Refshauge J considered the meaning of
“conviction” in
s 208(1)(b)
of the MCA. Travini was decided before
s 208(1)(g)
was introduced into the MCA;
s 208(1)(g)
now provides a
specific right to appeal against a driver licence disqualification order. In
Travini the appellant had pleaded guilty
to driving with a prescribed
concentration of alcohol in his blood. He was convicted, fined and disqualified
from driving. On the
appeal, the appellant was concerned about licence
disqualification. A
non-conviction order would have meant that he avoided
mandatory disqualification. A question arose as to whether the Court had
to entertain an appeal against licence disqualification, and this
prompted a consideration of
At [54] and [56], Refshauge J opined that
the term “conviction” in
s 208(1)(b)
of the MCA includes both a
finding of guilt preparatory to the imposition of a non-conviction order and the
formal recording of a
conviction. Consequently, his Honour found that the Court
had jurisdiction to deal with the appeal.
44. The applicant noted that, in
the nature of a non-conviction
order, it is usual to find a specific right to
appeal such orders. For example,
Crimes Act 1914
specifically confers a right to appeal a decision that a charge is
“proved”, and that right is expressed to be
the same right as that
which the appellant would have had “if the court had convicted him or her
of the offence”. In
New South Wales, without proceeding to conviction, a
court may make an order dismissing a charge or conditionally discharging the
offender: s 10
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
(NSW). Under
that Act, the person against whom such an order is made has the same right to
appeal on the ground that they are not guilty of
the offence “as the
person would have had if the person had been convicted of the offence”.
45. We accept that, by specifically conferring a right to appeal from a
non-conviction order, the Commonwealth and New South Wales
appeal provisions
acknowledge a significant distinction between a finding of guilt and a
conviction. However, in the ACT, neither
the MCA nor the Sentencing Act makes
express mention of an appeal from a finding of guilt that founds a
non-conviction order. In
those circumstances, little can be made of the
legislative provisions in other jurisdictions.
46. Sections 113 and 114 are
contained in pt 3.6 of the MCA, which deals with proceedings for offences that
are punishable summarily.
They provide:
Proceeding at hearing on defendant’s confession
If the defendant is present at the hearing ... and if the defendant has no
cause to show, the court may
the defendant,
or make an order
the defendant accordingly.
114 If defendant does not admit the case
(1) This section applies if the defendant does not admit the truth of the
information.
(3) Having heard each party and the evidence, the court must decide the
information and do 1 of the following as justice requires:
the defendant;
make an order
the defendant;
the information.
(Emphasis added)
47. Sections 113 and 114 of the MCA imply that a
“conviction” is inextricably related to a finding of guilt; that
will either be a conviction or a dismissal. They do not speak of a third
option, a finding of guilt followed by a non-conviction
order. We make this
observation on the assumption that the expression “make an order against/
on the defendant”, in
ss 113 and 114 refers to an order to enforce a
criminal penalty or forfeiture, and does not extend to the making of a
non-conviction
order: (see [39] above).
48. Division 3.10.2 of the MCA is
entitled “Appeals in criminal matters”. Section 208
208 Appeals to which div
3.10.2 applies
(1) Each of the following appeals is an appeal to which this division
(a) an appeal by any of the following from a

in relation to which the sentence or penalty was imposed;
(e) an appeal from

provisions of the
Crimes (Sentencing) Act
(Sentences of imprisonment);
(Non-custodial sentences);
(f) an appeal from an order of the court under the

period than the minimum.
209 Institution of appeal
(1) An appeal must be instituted by the appellant filing a notice of appeal

the period of 28 days
after the conviction was entered, the order or decision was made or the

(Emphasis added)
49. Section 208 distinguishes between a
“conviction” (s 208(1)(b)), an “order” made under ss 113
the MCA or under ss 374 or 375 of the
(s 208(1)(c), which
is discussed at [34]–[42] above), a “sentence or penalty”
imposed on a “convicted”
person (s 208(1)(d)) and an
“order” imposed under pt 3.2 or 3.3 of the Sentencing Act (s
208(1)(e)). As the Sentencing
Act consolidates sentencing in the ACT and as all
sentences imposed under parts 3.2 and 3.3 of the Sentencing Act are imposed by
“order”, it is difficult to understand the utility of including both
ss 208(1)(d) and 208(1)(e) in the MCA; the provisions
referred to in s 208(1)(d)
are procedural and jurisdictional provisions relating to sentencing in the
Magistrates Court and all the
substantive sentencing provisions are contained in
the Sentencing Act.
50. Like s 208, s 209 speaks of “conviction”,
“order”, “decision”, “sentence” and
“penalty” in the alternative, and does not identify as a separate
concept the finding of guilt or the finding that an
offence has been
51. Section 218 of the MCA confers upon the Supreme Court wide
appellate powers in relation to Magistrates Court decisions, but makes
reference to a finding of guilt, or a finding that an offence has been proved.
Section 218 picks up the terms “decision”,
“conviction”,
“order”, “sentence” and “penalty” that are
used in s 208. It provides:
an appeal to which this division applies, the Supreme Court may—
(a) confirm, reverse or vary the conviction, order, sentence, penalty or
decision appealed from; or
(b) give the judgment, or make the order, that, in all the circumstances, it
considers appropriate, or refuse to make an order; or
(c) set aside the conviction, order, sentence, penalty or decision appealed
from, in whole or in part, and remit the proceeding to
the Magistrates Court
52. Generally, in relation to appeals in criminal and related
matters, the MCA uses the expressions “decision”,
“conviction”,
“order” and “sentence or
penalty”. The rights of appeal in s 208(1)(b) can be compared to those in
ss 208(1)(d)
and (e). The former relate to appeals against
“conviction”, and the latter relate to appeals against sentence or
53. In relation to neither appeal provisions nor other
provisions does the MCA use the expression “finding that an offence has
been proved”, “finding of guilt” or any equivalent expression.
Nowhere does the MCA expressly acknowledge any distinction
“conviction” and a finding of guilt. Nor is there any express
mention of non-conviction; rather, the distinction
is between conviction and
dismissal. There is no recognition that a finding of guilt may result in a
non-conviction order made under
s 17 of the Sentencing Act.
other hand, throughout the MCA, a distinction is drawn between
“conviction” and “sentence”. As
Refshauge J observed in
Travini, at [52], both the general approach of the MCA and the particular
approach taken in s 208 are to
distinguish between the two principal stages in
the criminal justice process, i.e. conviction (including conviction in the sense
of finding that an offender is guilty) and sentence; conviction precedes and is
separate from sentence.
History of the appeal provisions in the
Magistrates Court
55. The MCA (then Ordinance No. 2) was enacted in 1930, when
non-conviction orders were an emerging concept in Australia. In 1942,
concept was first introduced in the ACT: see [59] below. The MCA has been the
subject of piecemeal amendment, but it has never
been thoroughly reviewed.
56. In 1930, the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance 1930 (ACT) was repealed
and replaced with Ordinance No. 2. The appeal provisions
were contained in pt
XI, which was entitled “Appeals from the Decisions of the Court of Petty
Sessions”. Relevantly,
s 207 provided that the High Court was to hear
“appeals from all rulings, orders, convictions or determinations of the
[of Petty Sessions].” Section 208 provided that a person
“aggrieved by or dissatisfied with an order or conviction of
the Court [of
Petty Sessions]” could appeal to the High Court. Why s 208 spoke of
“an order or conviction” but
s 207 spoke of “all rulings,
orders, convictions or determinations” is unclear. It would seem that s
208 was not intended
to limit the wide scope of the appellable decisions
referred to in s 207. In effect, Davies v Ryan adopted that approach.
57. In 1937, pt XI of Ordinance No. 2 was replaced. The new part continued
to distinguish between the right to appeal against a “conviction”
(flowing from a matter charged by information) and the right to appeal against
an “order” (which related to a complaint).
The new s 207 provided
that a person aggrieved “by a conviction of the Court [of Petty Sessions]
imposing a fine of Five pounds
or more, or any term of imprisonment ...”
(the sentencing threshold) may appeal against the conviction. Section 208
that, where the sentencing threshold in s 207 was not reached, it was
necessary to seek leave to appeal from the conviction. In
describing appeal
rights by reference to a sentencing threshold, the legislation used the term
“conviction” in the broad
sense of including sentence.
1958, all references to “order” in Ordinance No. 2 were omitted from
ss 208(1) and (5). Section 208A was inserted
to deal with appeals from
“an order of the Court [of Petty Sessions]”. The effect of the
amendments was that s 208 provided
for appeals from “conviction” in
criminal proceedings and s 208A provided for appeals from “orders”
proceedings.
59. As noted above, the first form of non-conviction
order (an order under s 556A of the
) had been introduced in 1942. In
1972, Ordinance No. 2 was amended. The existing civil and criminal appeal
provisions were repealed
and replaced with the following provisions:
207.—(1.) The
appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court with respect to decisions of the
Court of Petty Sessions under this
Ordinance extends to the hearing and
determination of the following appeals and to no others, namely:—
(a) appeals to which Division 2 of this Part applies; and
208.—(1.) Each of the following appeals is an appeal to which this
Division applies:—
(a) an appeal, by the person convicted, from a conviction for an offence
dealt with by the Court of Petty Sessions under Part VII
or under section two
hundred and fifty-five of this Ordinance;
(b) an appeal, by the person against whom the order is made, from an order
made in pursuance of section one hundred and thirteen or
section one hundred and
fourteen of this Ordinance in proceedings dealt with by the Court of Petty
Sessions under Part VII.;
(c) an appeal from a sentence or penalty imposed by the Court of Petty
Sessions by a person convicted of an offence dealt with by
that Court under
section ninety A or two hundred and fifty-five of this Ordinance or under Part
VII., whether or not that person
appeals against the conviction in respect of
which the sentence or penalty was imposed;
(d) an appeal, by the person charged, from a decision of the Court of Petty
Sessions made in pursuance of—
(i) sub-section
(1.) of section five hundred and fifty-six A of the
(ii) sub-section
(3.) of that section;
(e) an appeal,
by a person who has given a recognizance under section five hundred and
fifty-six A or five hundred and fifty-six
or by his [or her]
60. The Explanatory Memorandum to the 1972 amendments provided
that a purpose of the new provisions was to establish that “[a]n
a criminal case lies as of right in all cases and the existing requirement of
leave in certain cases is abolished”
(emphasis added). It seems to have
been assumed that, prior to the 1972 amendments, offenders who had been dealt
with under s 556A
could appeal (at least with leave).
61. As a result of the
1972 amendments, a “person convicted” could appeal from the
“conviction”, a “person
convicted” could appeal from
“a sentence or penalty” and a “person charged” could
appeal from a “decision”
under s 556A(1) or (3) of the
At that time, under s 556A of the
, if a court was
“satisfied” that a charge was proved, the court could either
“dismiss” the charge or order
the person to enter into a
recognizance. The 1972 amendments meant that, if a court found a charge to be
proved, the offender could
appeal, regardless of whether the finding of guilt
was a “conviction” within the meaning of s 208. If the finding of
guilt was not a “conviction” that was appellable under s 208(1)(a)
then, at least, it was a “decision” that
was appellable under s
62. In 2002 (pursuant to s 43 of the
Crimes Legislation Amendment
(ACT)), s 556A(1) was renumbered as s 402(1). The renumbered
section (s 402) was in identical terms to its predecessor (s 556A).
208(1)(e) of the MCA was amended to provide for an appeal “by the person
charged” from a “decision”
of the Magistrates Court made under
s 402(1) or (3) of the
. It remained uncertain whether, when the
beneficiary of a s 402 order appealed against a finding of guilt, the appeal was
by a “person
convicted” from a “conviction”, or it was
an appeal by a “person charged” from a
“decision”.
63. The current s 208(1)(e) was inserted by the
Sentencing Legislation Amendment Act 2006 (ACT) (for reference A2006-23). The
provision states:
Appeals to which div 3.10.2 applies
(1) Each of the following appeals is an appeal to which this division
(e) an appeal from an order of the court under any of the following
provisions of the
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
(i) part 3.2
(Sentences of imprisonment);
(ii) part 3.3
(Non-custodial sentences);
(iii) part 3.4
(Non-association and place restriction orders);
(iv) part 3.5
(Deferred sentence orders);
(v) part 3.6
(Combination sentences);
Crimes Act 1900
, pt 18 (Conditional release of offenders)
are taken to be orders under the
(Sentencing) Act 2005
(Sentence Administration) Act 2005
64. The Explanatory Memorandum states that the purpose of the
amendment to s 208(1)(e) was to update “the references to adult
sentencing options in section 208(1)(e) and (f) to those available in the new
sentencing scheme under the Sentencing Acts.”
There was no reference to
making a change to the substantive law.
65. In summary, the history of the
appeal provisions in the MCA shows that:
(a) The general structure
and the particular structure of s 208 distinguish between the
two essential stages in the criminal process: the adjudication of guilt
passing of sentence. Nowhere does the
differentiate between the
adjudication of guilt and “conviction”, and the
accord particular importance to the entry of a conviction.
(b) Since 1930, in the ACT there has been an avenue to appeal all criminal
convictions and sentences (although, for a period, leave
was required when
sentences did not exceed a threshold).
(c) Prior to the introduction of non-conviction orders to the ACT in 1942, in
criminal cases there was a right under
Ordinance No. 2
to appeal against
“conviction”, and “conviction” included sentence.
(d) Between 1942 and 1972, the
appeal provisions did not expressly
refer to non-conviction orders.
(e) The 1972 amendments to
Ordinance No. 2
created a right to appeal
by a “person charged” against a s 556A “decision”, but
did not clarify whether
an appeal against a finding of guilt that underlay a s
556A order was an appeal against “conviction” or an appeal against
s 556A “decision”. Either way, the beneficiary of a s 556A order
was entitled to appeal the underlying finding of
guilt; if that finding did not
amount to a “conviction”, it was at least a
“decision”.
(f) When s 208 of the
was “updated” in 2006 to reflect
the provisions of the new
Sentencing Act
(including the s 17 provisions
relating to non-conviction orders), there was no discussion about removing any
existing right of appeal.
Section 17 of the Sentencing Act
66. The issue before the Court arises because s 17 of the
Sentencing Act enables a sentencing court to make a “non-conviction
order” which avoids the entry of a conviction. Consequently, at the
conclusion of a defended criminal hearing, it is common
practice for the court
to find that the offence is proved (rather than stating that the offender is
convicted), thereby seeking to
reserve the option of later imposing a
“non-conviction order”.
67. Section 17 is found in Chapter 3 of
the Sentencing Act, which is entitled “Sentencing and non-conviction
Part 3.3 is entitled “non-custodial sentences”.
Within that part, s 17 provides:
Non-conviction orders—general
(1) This section applies if an offender is found guilty of an offence.
(2) Without convicting the offender of the offence, the court may make either
of the following orders (each of which is a
non-conviction
(a) an order directing that the charge be dismissed, if the court is
satisfied that it is not appropriate to impose any punishment
(other than
nominal punishment) on the offender;
(b) a good behaviour order under section 13.
(3) In deciding whether to make a non-conviction order for the offender, the
court must consider the following:
(a) the offender’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental
(b) the seriousness of the offence;
(c) any extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed.
(4) The court may also consider anything else the court considers
An appeal may lie to the Supreme Court from a decision of the
Magistrates Court to make a non-conviction order for an offender in
circumstances as an appeal from a decision of the Magistrates Court in relation
to an offender’s conviction for an
offence (see
Magistrates Court Act
(Emphasis in original)
68. The applicant assumed that, for the purposes of the
Sentencing Act, the expressions “conviction” and
“non-conviction
order” have opposite meanings. The applicant went
on to argue that the expression “conviction” in s 208(1)(b)
MCA is the antithesis of the expression “non-conviction” in the
Sentencing Act. For the reasons that appear below,
we disagree with that
69. It should not be assumed that a “conviction”
within the meaning of the MCA is the antithesis of a “non-conviction
order” within the meaning of the Sentencing Act. The statutes were
created at different times and for different purposes.
Unless two Acts are
introduced as part of one larger legislative scheme, the meaning to be accorded
to a term in one Act does not
necessarily inform the meaning of the term in
another Act, particularly if they do not concern the same subject matter: H v
for Immigration and Citizenship
[2010] FCAFC 119
(2010) 188 FCR 393
The MCA had its origins in Ordinance No. 2 and it deals with jurisdiction and
procedures in the Magistrates Court. The Sentencing
Act is recent legislation,
which was designed, among other things, to consolidate legislation relating to
the imposition of sentences
in the ACT: see s 6(e) of the Sentencing
70. A “non-conviction order” under the Sentencing Act is not
the opposite of a “conviction” under the MCA.
A non-conviction order
is a creation of the Sentencing Act and it should be viewed as a form of
sentence. A s 17(2)(a) non-conviction/dismissal
order may be made in
circumstances where it is appropriate to impose only “nominal
punishment” (emphasis added). Both
the consideration of
“punishment” and the other considerations that inform whether a
non-conviction order should be made
are sentencing considerations. When a court
is deciding whether to impose any sentence (including one under s 17), it must
the sentencing purposes set out in s 7 of the Sentencing Act and the
relevant sentencing considerations under s 33 of the Sentencing
relation to whether a non-conviction order should be made under s 17, further
considerations are identified within the section
itself, and each is a
sentencing consideration.
71. Like other sentences, a non-conviction order
is a sentence imposed upon an “offender”. Section 7(1) of the
Act enables a court to “impose a sentence on an offender”
for one or more of the purposes stated in that subsection.
Section 8 of the
Sentencing Act defines “offender” to mean “a person convicted
or found guilty of an offence by
a court”, confirming that the Sentencing
Act (and the general sentencing process) applies to two sorts of persons: those
have been found guilty, and those in relation to whom a conviction has been
entered. In other words, like the MCA, the Sentencing
Act acknowledges that
there are two essential stages in the criminal process: the adjudication of
guilt and the passing of sentence.
72. The imposition of a non-conviction
order following a finding of guilt is a sentencing outcome that is exceptional:
Stark v Plant
[2010] WASCA 74
; Proud v Sladic
[2014] ACTCA 26 (Proud
Sladic). The ordinary consequence of a finding of guilt is the recording of a
conviction: Balthazar v The Queen
[2012] ACTCA 26
non-conviction order is a sentence that acknowledges extenuating circumstances
(relating either subjectively to the offender
or objectively to the offence) by
imposing a nominal or very low level of punishment that does not involve the
formal recording of
a conviction. It is a sentencing outcome that recognises
that indirect punishment may flow from the formal recording of a conviction,
such as reputational damage or practical disadvantage associated with declaring
a conviction for employment or travel purposes.
74. The first form of
non-conviction order available in the ACT was found in s 556A of the
, which was inserted into the
in 1942. Section 556A(1) provided
any person is charged
before a Court of summary jurisdiction with an
offence punishable by such Court, and the Court
thinks that the charge is
, but is of opinion that ... is inexpedient to inflict any punishment,
or any other than a nominal punishment, or that it is expedient
to release the
offender on probation, the Court may,
without proceeding to conviction
(a) dismissing the charge; or
(b) discharge the offender conditionally on his [or her] entering into a
reconnaissance ...
(Emphasis added)
Pursuant to s 556A(2), for limited purposes (relating to the
restoration of property), an order under that section had “the
like effect
of a conviction”. It would seem that, in s 556A(1) and (2), the term
“conviction” meant the formal
entry of a conviction (rather than the
unequivocal finding of guilt); hence the need for ss (2).
75. In 1971, s 556A
was repealed and replaced by the Crimes Ordinance 1971 (No. 2 of 1971). The new
s 556A(1) provided that:
(1.) Where—
a person is charged before the Court of Petty Sessions with an
offence against a law of the Territory; and
is satisfied that the charge is proved
opinion, having regard to—
character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person;
extent, if any, to which the offence is of a trivial nature; or
extent, if any, to which the offence was committed under extenuating
circumstances,
inexpedient to inflict any punishment, or to inflict any punishment other than a
nominal punishment, or that it is expedient
to release the person on probation,
the Court may
dismiss the charge or, without proceeding to conviction, by
direct that the person be discharged upon his [or her] giving
security, with or without sureties, by recognizance or otherwise, to
satisfaction of the Court, that—
76. The new s 556A required the sentencing court to be
“satisfied” that the charge was proved before proceeding to either
“dismiss the charge” or “without proceeding to conviction, by
order, direct that the person be discharged upon
his [or her] giving security,
with or without sureties, by recognizance or otherwise...”. Note that,
under the previous provision,
the expression “without proceeding to
conviction” attached both to a dismissal outcome and to a discharge with
outcome. This change was not explained by the Explanatory Memorandum,
which merely stated that the new provisions enabled a court
“to release an
offender without passing sentence, to release him [or her] on recognizance
subject to such conditions as the
court considers appropriate”. In any
event, both the earlier provisions and the new provisions recognised that there
two stages to criminal proceedings: first, the court determined whether a
charge was proved; second, the court considered the appropriate
punishment. In
2001, s 556A was renumbered as s 402 but without other amendment.
the Sentencing Act was introduced, s 402 of the
was replaced by
s 17 of the Sentencing Act.
78. In interpreting the MCA appeal
provisions, no reliance can be placed on the note to s 17 of the Sentencing
Act (which is set out
in [67] above). First, while a note may be used in
“working out the meaning of an Act”, a note to an Act is not part
Legislation Act
. Second, the note to
is contained in the Sentencing Act, not the MCA. The Sentencing Act was
introduced many years after the MCA. In the absence of
clear contrary intent,
meaning and purpose cannot be retrospectively attributed to the MCA.
79. If the applicant’s argument is correct and a finding of
guilt is not a “conviction” within the meaning of the
MCA, then the
making of a non-conviction order directing that a charge be dismissed (under s
17(2)(a) of the Sentencing Act) would
presumably result in a
“dismissal”, and a question would arise about whether the sentenced
person was entitled to pursue
a review appeal against the
“dismissal” (and the underlying finding of guilt) pursuant to s 219B
of the MCA.
80. Division 3.10.3 of the MCA makes provision for “review
appeals” in criminal matters. It provides:
Decisions subject to review appeal
(1) Each of the following is a decision of the Magistrates Court from which
an appeal by way of review (a
review appeal
) may be made in
accordance with this division:
of the Magistrates Court
an information
dealt with by that court under this Act, part 3.6 (Proceedings for offences
punishable summarily) or part 3.7 (Service
and pleading by post for certain
offences) or under the
, section 374 or section 375;
by the Magistrates Court for an offence dealt with by
that court under this Act, part 3.6 or part 3.7 or under the
374 or section 375;
sentence or penalty
imposed by the Magistrates Court for an
offence dealt with by that court under this Act, section 90A, part 3.6 or part
3.7 or under
, section 374 or section 375.
(2) In subsection (1)(f):
sentence or penalty
includes a sentence or penalty imposed by
an order of the Magistrates Court under—
(a) any of the following provisions of the
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
(Sentences of imprisonment);
(Non-custodial sentences);
(Emphasis added)
81. Whereas an appeal under div 3.10.2 of the MCA is an appeal
by way of rehearing in which fresh evidence may be received, an appeal
3.10.3 of the MCA enables a review on the ground of prima facie error or mistake
by the Magistrates Court, lack of jurisdiction,
legal error or, in the case of
an appeal against sentence or penalty under s 219B(1)(f) of the MCA, review
on the ground that the
sentence or penalty “was manifestly inadequate or
otherwise in error”: s 219D of the MCA. Division 3.10.3 creates limited
rights of appeal that are of particular relevance to informants.
Division 3.10.3 was introduced in 1972 (then referred to as div
The relevant Explanatory Memorandum provides:
Its use is largely confined to
the criminal jurisdiction and it provides a convenient means whereby decisions
of the Court of Petty
Sessions on questions of law may be reviewed by the
Supreme Court. The procedure is available to both prosecutor and defendant. For
the first time in the Territory, it will be possible for a prosecutor to appeal
against the dismissal of an information charging
an offence but, in such a case,
the defendant’s costs of the appeal will be payable by the prosecutor
whatever the outcome
of the appeal.
82. If an offender who received a
dismissal order was
limited to instituting a review appeal, the offender’s appeal rights would
be significantly more limited
than if there was a right to appeal under s 208.
Further, there would be an undesirable anomaly in relation to the appeal rights
attaching to the two types of non-conviction orders that may be made under s 17
of the Sentencing Act. It would be anomalous if
an offender was entitled to a
“review appeal” of a non-conviction order (and the underlying
finding of guilt) made under
s 17(2)(a), but was not entitled to appeal the
underlying finding of guilt relating to a non-conviction order made under s
of the Sentencing Act.
Human Rights Act
of the HRA provides that a law of the Territory
“must be interpreted in a way that is compatible with human rights”,
so far as it is possible to do so. This raises the question of whether any
human right referred to in the HRA is relevant to the
interpretation of s
208(1)(b) of the MCA.
84. In Travini at [62], Refshauge J placed some
reliance on
of the HRA when considering the breadth of s 208
appeal rights.
of the HRA provides:
part applies to all Territory laws.
“This part” is a reference to
of the HRA and
86. The HRA appears to create an exception to the general rule
that meaning cannot be retrospectively attributed to legislation.
The terms of
indicate that legislation that pre-dates the HRA “must [also] be
interpreted in a way that is compatible with human rights”;
applies to the interpretation of statutes enacted prior to the HRA, despite the
fact that such statutes may have been enacted at
a time when contemporary human
rights concepts could not have informed the purpose of their enactment.
87. This approach is reinforced by the terms of the Explanatory Memorandum,
presented with the introduction of the Bill, which states:
The main purpose of this Bill is to recognise fundamental civil and political
rights in Territory law. In particular, the Bill ensures
that, to the maximum
extent possible, all Territory statutes and statutory instruments are
interpreted in a way that respects and
protects the human rights set out in Part
3 of the Bill.
Clause 29 Application of part 4
Clause 29 applies the provisions of Part 4 to all Territory laws. Territory laws
are defined to mean all Territory statutes and statutory
instruments. This Bill
does not expressly apply to the common law although it may influence the
development of the common law.
88. The HRA refers to two human rights which may be relevant to
the interpretation of s 208(1)(b) of the MCA: the right to review
decisions in criminal cases which is contained in s 22(4) of the HRA, and the
right to reputation in s 12 of the HRA.
89. Section 22(4) of the HRA provides
that “Anyone convicted of a criminal offence has the right to have the
conviction and
sentence reviewed by a higher court...”.
90. First, it
is necessary to determine the scope of this right of review. For the purpose of
doing so, it is necessary to consider
the meaning of the expression
“conviction” where it is used in the HRA.
91. The s 22(4) right
to review of decisions in criminal cases reflects (almost verbatim) art 14
paragraph 5 of the International
Covenant of the Civil and Political Rights
92. Section 31(1) of the HRA provides that, subject to the
considerations referred to in s 31(2), “International law, and the
judgments of foreign and international courts and tribunals, relevant to a human
right may be considered in interpreting the human
decisions of the Human Rights Committee come within this definition. The Human
Rights Committee is a body established pursuant
to the ICCPR, for the purpose of
considering and determining complaints alleging that a State has acted in
violation of the ICCPR.
From time to time, the Human Rights Committee issues
interpretations, referred to as “General Comments”, on provisions
94. General Comment No. 32 relates to art 14 of the ICCPR. At
[47], the Human Rights Committee observed that the right to review
is violated
“if the decision by the court of first instance is final”, i.e. not
subject to review. The Human Rights
Committee Comment referred to a
“decision”, rather than “a finding of guilt”. Further,
at [48] of the Comment,
the Human Rights Committee referred to
“conviction”, “convicted person” and “a finding of
without distinguishing between the terms. It would seem that, in
the Comment, the Human Rights Committee did not distinguish between
“conviction” and “finding of guilt”, using the terms
interchangeably to refer to the determination
of an allegation that a person has
committed a criminal offence. Such an approach is consistent with that taken in
Human Rights
Committee, Decision: Communication No. 536/1993,
53rd sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/53/D/536/1993 (28 March 1995) (‘Perera v
Australia’),
where the Human Rights Committee referred to the fact that
the complainant was “found guilty” and to the complainant’s
“conviction” without distinction.
95. Applying the approach of
the Human Rights Committee to the meaning of “conviction” in the
HRA, “conviction”
in s 22(4) of the HRA includes a finding of guilt.
96. Accordingly, applying s 30(1) of the HRA, the Court must, so far as it
is possible to do so, interpret s 208(1)(b) of the MCA
in a way that does not
violate an offender’s human right to have his or her
“conviction” (including the underlying
finding of guilt) reviewed by
a higher court.
97. Section 12(b) of the HRA provides that every person has
the right not to have his or her reputation unlawfully attacked. This
art 17 of the ICCPR. The question is: does the inability of a person to appeal
from a finding of guilt infringe that person’s
right “not to have
their reputation unlawfully attacked”? We have concluded that it does
98. The Human Rights Committee observed in General Comment 16 at [11],
that “[a]rticle 17 affords protection to personal honour
reputation and States are under an obligation to provide adequate legislation to
99. In Mikolajová v Slovakia (European Court of Human
Rights, Chamber, Application No. 4470/03, 18 January 2011)
(Mikolajová
v Slovakia), the European Court of Human Rights, considered
the extent of this right. The Court was considering art 8 of the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).
It had been alleged that the applicant had committed
a criminal offence, but the
police had not prosecuted the matter because the complainant had not supported a
prosecution. The police
file contained “a decision” to the effect
that the applicant had committed the offence. A third party read the
“decision”.
The applicant alleged that their right to protection of
reputation had been violated. In the particular circumstances of the case,
Court concluded that there had been a violation of the right to protection of
reputation. The Court observed at [61]–[62]:
particular concern to the Court is the fact that the applicant had not been
charged with a criminal offence but was nevertheless
placed on record as a
criminal offender. The Court has already had occasion to point to the risk of
stigmatisation of individuals
stemming from such practices and the threat which
they represent to the principle of the presumption of innocence. For the Court,
the damage which may be caused to the reputation of the individual concerned
through the communication of inaccurate or misleading
information cannot be
ignored either. The Court would also observe with concern that the authorities
have not indicated whether the
police decision remains valid indefinitely, such
as to constitute, with each communication to a third party, assuming such to be
in pursuit of a legitimate aim, a continuing threat to the applicant's right to
reputation.
In examining whether the domestic authorities have complied with the
above-mentioned fair balance requirement, the Court must have
regard to the
safeguards in place in order to avoid arbitrariness in decision-making and to
secure the rights of the individual against
abuse. In the instant case, the
Court cannot but note the lack of any available recourse through which the
applicant could obtain
a subsequent retraction or clarification of the terms of
the police decision.

100. Human rights are not absolute. They interact with other
rights. As stated in s 28(1) of the HRA, human rights are subject “to
reasonable limits set by laws that can be demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society.”
101. A critical distinction between the facts in
Mikolajová v Slovakia and those of the present case is that, in the
case, the decision that the respondent seeks to appeal was made after
the respondent was afforded procedural fairness in open court.
The right to a
hearing was a critical safeguard against “arbitrariness in
decision-making”.
102. The right to protection of reputation in s 12
of the HRA provides that a person has the right not to have their reputation
“unlawfully
attacked”. The decision of a properly constituted court
cannot be characterised as an “unlawful attack” on reputation.
Similarly, art 17 of the ICCPR provides that a person’s reputation is not
to be the subject of “unlawful attacks”.
In General Comment 16 at
[3] the Human Rights Committee observed:
term "unlawful" means that no interference can take place except in cases
envisaged by the law. Interference authorized by States
can only take place on
the basis of law, which itself must comply with the provisions, aims and
objectives of the Covenant.
Section 208 is a remedial provision
103. The provisions of ch 3 of the MCA are remedial in nature.
They seek to redress injustices that the rigidity of the common law
failing to provide for appeals. Because it is a remedial provision, s 208
should “be given a broad, and not a narrow
or restricted,
interpretation”: Davison & Ors v State of Queensland
(2006) 227 ALR 1
at [41] per Kirby J. Of course, legislation with a beneficial purpose can only
“receive as generous a construction as the
actual language of those
provisions permits”: Legal Services Board v Gillespie-Jones
[2013] HCA 35
(2013) 249 CLR
per French CJ, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ (emphasis added).
104. The remedial nature of the provisions in ch 3 of the MCA (including s
208) supports the view that “conviction” should
be interpreted to
include a finding of guilt, or a finding that an offence has been proved,
because such an interpretation affords
a right of appeal to all offenders
against whom such a finding is made.
The applicant’s submission on fragmentation
105. The applicant submitted that, if there was a right to
appeal against a finding of guilt as well as rights to appeal against formal
conviction and sentence, the practical result would be an undesirable
fragmentation of the criminal justice process.
106. This submission is
rejected. First, the proper construction of legislation cannot depend upon
whether a construction has negative
practical consequences. Second, in defended
proceedings in the Magistrates Court, the sentencing hearing commonly occurs
immediately
after the question of guilt has been decided. The determination of
guilt, the entry of conviction and sentence are considered on
the same day and
there is no fragmentation. In cases where the sentencing hearing is adjourned
to a later date, there can be no
valid objection to “fragmentation”
if it allows an appellant to challenge a finding of guilt before he or she is
to address sentencing considerations, including whether the finding of
guilt warrants the exceptional sentencing outcome of a non-conviction
Proud v Sladic at [42].
107. A finding by the Magistrates
Court that an offence has been proved (a finding of guilt) is a
“conviction” within
the meaning of s 208(1)(b) of the
108. We reach that conclusion for the following key reasons:
word “conviction” has no “ordinary meaning”. Depending
on the context in which it is used, it may
refer to a finding of guilt, to the
formal recording of a conviction or to the finalisation of criminal proceedings
by the imposition
of a sentence. See [18]–[32] above.
(b) The MCA
generally and s 208 of the MCA in particular distinguish between the two
principal stages in the criminal justice process:
“conviction” in
the sense of the adjudication of guilt, and the passing of sentence. See
[33]–[54] above.
(c) Historically, under the MCA and its predecessors
there has been an avenue to appeal against both a finding of guilt and a
and the legislature has never stated an intention to change that
approach. See [55]–[65] above.
(d) The expression “non-conviction
order” in s 17 of the Sentencing Act does not inform the meaning of
“conviction”
in the MCA. A non-conviction order under s 17 of the
Sentencing Act is best understood as a form of sentence. It relates to the
second of the two principal stages in the criminal justice process. It does not
relate to the first stage: the finding of guilt.
See [66]–[78]
(e) Applying the HRA (as interpreted by reference to international
human rights law), s 208 of the MCA should be interpreted in a
manner that is
compatible with the human right to have a “conviction” (finding of
guilt) reviewed by a higher court,
i.e. in s 208 of the MCA the expression
“conviction” should be interpreted to mean a finding of guilt. See
(f) The remedial nature of the provisions in ch 3 of
the MCA (including s 208) supports the view that “conviction” means
a finding of guilt; such an interpretation affords a right of appeal to all
offenders against whom such a finding is made. See [103]–[104]
