WORDS IN SQUARE BRACKETS REPLACE WORDS USED IN THE ORIGINAL JUDGMENT -
PARTIES’ NAMES AND IDENTIFYING DETAILS HAVE BEEN CHANGED
1 Before the Court is the wife’s interim
application for spousal maintenance. She seeks a payment from the husband
per week. The husband, in his response, seeks no interim orders, but it
is clear that he opposes the wife’s application.
2 The Court made orders on 25 February 2011 by consent in relation to
property settlement. It would appear that the husband’s
solicitors at the
time drafted the Form 11 application for consent orders. The orders
reflected a 50/50 division of assets. Both
parties had advice and both had a
lawyer sign the “statement of independent legal advice” on their
3 The wife was working and had a stated income of $480 per week as an office
administrator at the time. The Court approved the orders,
but the orders
included paragraph 7 which is in the following terms:
That both the applicant and respondent shall not make any claims against one
another for spousal maintenance now or in the future.
4 A significant issue is the validity of that clause. Parties are not able
to contract out of their obligations under the
Family Law Act
of consent orders. In the event the parties wish to do so, they must enter
a financial agreement pursuant to the Act. That
allows them to defeat (with
appropriate safeguards as to form) various provisions of the Act.
5 This is usually the practice when parties want to ensure that no spousal
maintenance is payable in the future, when such guarantees
cannot be provided
under the normal operation of the
Family Law Act
. A common example
is where a party relies upon an incometested pension or benefit and is
otherwise unable to adequately support
themselves without it. A court order, in
that scenario, could not validly be made which defeated their right to claim
spousal maintenance
in the future.
6 In this case, it appears the wife was working, but a party cannot contract
out with a clause such as this. Unfortunately, two
lawyers were involved in the
drafting and checking of this clause and the Court approved it as part of the
overall orders. Notwithstanding
all of that, the clause is clearly invalid. It
may be relied upon by the husband as an indicator of the intention of the wife
not claim spousal maintenance, but it cannot defeat her right to such a
claim. I note that it has been somewhat effective given
the wife’s claim
has only been filed nearly four years later. The wife’s claim for spousal
maintenance therefore must
be determined according to normal legal principles,
as if that order had never been made.
7 The test under
of the Act is whether the wife can satisfy the
Court that she is unable to adequately support herself pursuant to the reasons
out in that section. The wife accepts that she has the physical and mental
capacity for work. She works as a receptionist on a
parttime basis and is the
primary caregiver to the two children. The current arrangements are that the
children spend each weekend
in the husband’s care, so the wife has the
responsibility for the children during the week. I accept, in those
circumstances,
that she is unable to adequately support herself due to having
the care and control of the two children.
Extent of the wife’s financial need
8 The wife started part-time study by way of a Post Graduate Diploma of
Psychology during the marriage.
9 In October 2010 she commenced part-time work.
10 Her affidavit sets out the steps that she must take to survive
financially. An example is shopping at Good Sammy’s. She
access limited savings to meet her everyday living expenses. The wife’s
income is reasonable in the circumstances and
it is in accordance with her
earning capacity. Her income is $575 per week plus $250 per week by way of
child support payments,
totalling $825 per week. I have ignored her Centrelink
benefits as required by the Act.
11 Her personal expenses are $1,708 per week. Given expenses claimed by the
husband, I intend to reduce some of her expenses to
a figure closer to the level
that he claims. The following sets out what I consider to be reasonable
reductions to the wife’s
weekly expenses.
Claimed Amount
Reduced Amount
Household supplies
Entertainment
Hairdressing
12 The overall savings set out above amounts to $437 per week. This reduces
her claimed expenses to a more reasonable amount of
$1,271 per week. Even
making these reductions, the wife clearly has a need for spousal maintenance in
at least the amount of $446
per week. I have done similar calculations where I
have only taken into account the expenses the wife has allocated to her and have
ignored any expenses relating to the children. By that process and comparing
those figures to the wife’s income (excluding
any child support) it makes
little difference to the overall amount.
Husband’s capacity to pay
13 The husband has an income of $2,311 per week. There is a significant
difference in the parties’ incomes. The husband earns
four times more
than the wife. His expenses really only include one amount that is
unreasonable. His total expenses amounts to
$2,572 per week. He includes
superannuation at $138 per week which must be reduced to nil. It should not be
the case that he makes
voluntary superannuation contributions when the wife is
clearly in need of financial assistance.
14 Given the children’s arrangements are that the children spend each
weekend from Friday to Monday with him, his claimed expenses
in relation to the
children amount to the costs of maintaining them for three nights per week, and
the wife maintains them for four
nights per week. The amount the husband claims
for the children’s expenses is $257 per week and the wife claims $410 per
Both amounts therefore appear to be in reasonable proportions.
15 The further amounts claimed by the husband are reasonable expenses and
for the most part are close to what I have considered to
be reasonable for the
16 The above calculation therefore has reduced his claimed expenses from
$2,572 per week to $2,434 per week. This amount still exceeds
and I therefore conclude that he has no capacity to pay spousal maintenance
on an interim basis. The reality is that
he has a significant amount of tax
payable per week and has larger mortgage repayments.
17 I must also consider the overall circumstances of each party as it is not
only income to which the Court is able to look to achieve
a spousal maintenance
order. The husband, in terms of major assets, owns a home worth
approximately $740,000 with a mortgage of
$340,000. The equity in his property
is about $400,000. The wife owns a property worth $530,000 with a mortgage of
$90,000. Her
equity therefore is $440,000.
18 In those circumstances I am not satisfied that the husband has the
appropriate capacity to pay spousal maintenance and I therefore
dismiss the
wife’s interim application.
I certify that the preceding [18] paragraphs are a true copy
of the reasons for
judgment delivered by this Honourable
