(2019) 265 CLR 164
APPEARANCES:
Not applicable
[1] On 13 March 2020 this Court allowed an appeal by the Western Downs Regional
Council against the Land Court’s decision to
categorise the
respondent’s land as rural (category 3/16) rather than Petroleum Other
(>400 ha) (category 4/31).
[2] The appellant has applied for an order that the respondent pay its costs of
and incidental to this appeal. The appellant also
submits that the respondent
should pay its costs of and incidental to the hearing below, even though the
costs of the hearing below
were the subject of a consent order that the present
appellant pay the respondent’s costs.
Appellant’s
submissions
[3] The appellant submits that it squarely raised the central issue in dispute
between the parties as early as 2 April 2018 when,
in its Statement of Facts,
Matters and Contentions in Response, it stated “the particular use of the
subject land by the [the
respondent] personally during the relevant period does
not affect the matters of fact asserted in the preceding subparagraphs”.
The appellant submits that, in his Statement of Facts, Matters and Contentions
in reply filed on 20 April 2018, the respondent admitted
that the land was being
used in a way which fell within category 4/31.
[4] The appellant submits that this matter did not involve a difficult or
unusual construction exercise, or any novel question of
law. It submits that the
issue was ultimately determined “giving a practical, sensible, broad and
fair reading to the appellant’s
revenue statement and rating categories in
the context of orthodox principles of statutory interpretation”. It
submits that
this proceeding is not public interest litigation and the supposed
“ambiguity” in the revenue statement was roundly rejected
[5] The appellant submits that a party related to the respondent conducts a
commercial activity on the subject land and the respondent
had a commercial
interest in pursuing the appeal. If the respondent had been successful, his
rating liability would have been significantly
[6] Finally, the appellant points out that it is a public authority largely
funded by ratepayers. In the absence of a cost order
in its favour, the
ratepayers for the whole local government area will bear the burden of its costs
of this proceeding which was,
largely, a private proceeding to pursue a
commercial aim. It says that the appeal was necessary to correct an erroneous
conceived and urged by the
respondent.
Respondent’s
submissions
[7] The respondent submits that there should be no order as to costs of this
appeal. He says that, in exercising the discretion as
to costs, the Court may
scrutinise the conduct of the parties, which means that the exercise of the
discretion must take into account
the conduct of all parties and any other
relevant factor.
[8] The respondent submits that his conduct in appealing the rating
categorisation was arguable because the manner of categorisation
was uncertain.
He drew the Court’s attention to the appellant’s
“policy” document of December 2017 which
noted the potential for
uncertainty:
“Council categorises and rates all rateable
properties in the Western Downs region. A transfer or sale of a property will
of itself, result in a change in category.
However there is the potential for uncertainty around the characterisation of
properties currently characterised as either 430 or
431 and subsequently sold or
transferred. This Policy seeks to clarify this uncertainty.
In clarifying this uncertainty, this Policy provides the potential owners of
these properties a greater understanding of issues they
need to consider in
negotiating the purchase or transfer of the property. This may be through the
sales contract and/or through compensation
agreements.”
[9] The respondent also submits that the appellant stated, in effect, that his
position was unique having regard to the prior gas
company ownership. He refers
to a letter from the respondent dated 4 January 2018, which
“Council is very aware that many properties with
similar gas infrastructure are rated 3/16 (Rural). The difference is that these
parties have never been owned by coal seam gas companies. They have never been
rated as anything other than 3/16 (Rural).”
[10] The respondent notes that the appellant has not explained why a
neighbouring property with the same use attributes and same
history of ownership
by a gas company is not also rated 4/31. In addition, the respondent referred to
the absurd situations which
may result from a strict application of both rating
categories 4/30 and 4/31.
[11] The respondent submits that the appellant now has a political choice: to
maintain the relevant categories in their present form
with greatly increased
rates for rural landholders, or to alter the drafting so that people in the
respondent’s position can
maintain a rural rating category. The respondent
says that he ought not bear the costs of highlighting this anomaly in the
appellant’s
revenue statement.
Consideration
[12] Section 34 (1) of the
Land Court Act 2000
provides that the Court
may order costs as it considers appropriate, subject to provisions to the
contrary in any enabling Act. The
Local Government Regulation 2012
gives the Land Court the power to decide the appeal, is silent about the
disposition of the costs of the appeal. Therefore,
the question of costs is to
be determined under the
Land Court Act 2000
[13] There is no doubt that this Court has the power to award costs for an
appeal as it considers appropriate and that power includes
a power to award
costs of the original
proceeding.
[14] There was no matter of principle to be determined in this appeal, nor was
there any real ambiguity in the wording of the rating
categories, despite that
view being articulated in the appellant’s correspondence.
[15] The issue in this case was simply one of statutory interpretation. The fact
that another property in a similar situation was
under a different rating regime
cannot be determinative of that question of statutory interpretation.
[16] The fact that the appellant is funded by its ratepayers should not be a
consideration in the exercise of our
discretion.
[17] Here, the respondent’s challenge had commercial advantages for him.
The appellant was put to expense at the respondent’s
behest. There is no
reason why the usual rule – that costs should follow the event –
should not apply. As this Court
has previously
“...although
the discretion to award costs is unfettered, the rule that costs follow the
event may inform the exercise of the
discretion granted under s 34(1), ‘as
there is justice in that approach. It protects those put to unnecessary and
substantial
expense at the behest of others.’” (Citations
[18] The consent order for costs in the decision below was, no doubt, a matter
of expediency between the parties. It would have been
better if the parties had
simply asked the Court to make that order, not by consent, but without serious
opposition by the appellant.
However, the parties’ agreement was based on
an erroneous finding by the Court.
[19] As that finding has now been corrected on appeal, there is no good reason
why the appellant should not also receive a costs
order in its favour in respect
of the proceeding below. The order of 12 April 2019, that the respondent
(Council) pay the appellant’s
(Geldard’s) costs of the appeal
assessed on a standard basis, should be set aside. Instead, the respondent
(Geldard) should
pay the appellant’s (Council’s) costs of the appeal
below assessed on the standard basis.
respondent pay the appellant’s costs of and incidental to this appeal on
the standard basis as agreed or assessed.
orders of the Land Court dated 12 April 2019 that the appellant pay the
