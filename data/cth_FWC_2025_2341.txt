Alleged dispute about matters arising under the Woodside Energy Ltd North

Australian Workers’ Union (
) has made an application for
the Fair Work Commission (
to deal with a dispute in
accordance with a dispute settlement procedure. The Respondent is Woodside
Energy Ltd (

employees affected by the dispute are employed by the Respondent to carry out
offshore work. The Respondent demobilises employees
from its offshore platforms

not in dispute that the parties have tried to resolve the dispute at the
workplace level, by discussions between the employees
and management in
compliance with clause 25.1(c) of the Agreement and that those discussions did
not resolve the dispute. In these
circumstances clause 25.1(d) enables a party
to the dispute to refer the matter to the Commission.
25.1(e) provides that the Commission may deal with the dispute in two stages,
first attempting to resolve the dispute as it
considers appropriate, including
by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a recommendation.
Clause 25.1(e)(ii)
provides that if the Commission is unable to resolve the
dispute at the first stage, it may then arbitrate the dispute and make a
determination that is binding on the parties. The matter did not resolve via
mediation, it is not in dispute that the Commission
has the power to arbitrate
the dispute,
and the matter was
therefore listed for hearing after taking into account the views of the parties.
Hearing and representation
parties sought to be represented by a lawyer. I was satisfied that legal
complexity arose in relation to the matter in that the
dispute related to the
proper construction of the Agreement and that the matter would proceed more
efficiently if the parties were
assisted by lawyers with an understanding of the
relevant legal principles in this regard. As such I granted permission for both
parties to be represented by a lawyer pursuant to
s.596(2)(a)
Work Act 2009
) and both parties were represented by a
lawyer at the hearing on 12 August 2025.
parties conferred regarding the questions for determination but were unable to
reach agreement on a suitable question. The Applicant
suggested that the
appropriate question for determination was:
clause 11.9 of the Agreement facilitates employees working from the
Respondent’s Perth office in the event the Respondent’s
are affected by a cyclone or other adverse weather event which prevents the safe
performance of work on a platform; or,
in the alternative
in account clause 11.9 of the Agreement, in the event that the
Respondent’s operations are affected by a cyclone or other
adverse weather
event which prevents the safe performance of work on a platform, can the
Respondent direct employees to work from
its Perth office?
Respondent sought an answer to the question of whether clause 11.9 of the
Agreement prevented it from directing its employees
to perform work from its
Perth office in the event that its operations are affected by the safe
performance of work on a platform.
Respondent submitted that its proposed question for determination was more
appropriate to resolve the substance of the dispute
between the parties, being
whether the Agreement prohibited it from directing employees to work from the
Perth office when they are
demobilised during cyclone
The Respondent submitted
its position is not and has not at any time been that the Agreement empowers it
to issue such a direction,
but rather that it simply does not prohibit or
prevent such a direction being
The Respondent submitted
that even if the questions proposed by the AWU are answered in the negative,
there will still be a live
issue as to whether the Respondent is empowered (for
example under the express or implied terms of the employees’ contracts)
issue such a direction which is a matter beyond the scope of the
Commission’s jurisdiction in this
Applicant indicated it was ultimately seeking to understand what work clause
11.9 has to do and submitted a binary answer on a
single prohibition would not
address how the clause is intended to apply. During the hearing the Applicant
submitted that the Agreement
contemplates a mode of working in the event of a
cyclone and the task is to establish what the Agreement is positively structured
to do. The Applicant clarified that its argument is not just whether the
Agreement contemplates working from the Perth office in
a cyclone event but that
the Agreement has a scheme that positively identifies what
those circumstances.
dispute is ultimately about whether the Respondent is able to direct employees
to work in its Perth office if operations are impacted
by a cyclone or other
adverse weather event which prevents the safe performance of work on a platform.
The only way in which the
dispute is to be genuinely resolved is by answering
this question. The powers of the Commission are however limited by the dispute
settlement term which enables it to settle a dispute if it relates
(a) a matter arsing under the Agreement; or
(b) the National Employment Standard.
such, the resolution of this dispute is directed toward the Agreement, as
distinct from what contractual rights may arise from
express or implied terms in
individual contracts of employment.
Respondent emphasised that that its position is not that clause 11.9 facilitates
work in the Perth office in the event of a cyclone
or adverse weather
Rather, its position is that
the Agreement does not prohibit or prevent it from issuing a direction to
employees to work in the Perth
office in these circumstances. The issues that
fall within the Commission’s jurisdiction and which are relevant to the
of the dispute therefore include:
work clause 11.9 has to do; and
considering
clause 11.9 and other relevant provisions of the Agreement, whether the
Agreement prevents the Respondent from directing
its employees to work from its
Peth office in the event that the Respondent’s operations are affected by
a cyclone or other
adverse weather event which prevents the safe performance of
work on a platform.
Submissions
Applicant’s submissions
Applicant’s position is that, pursuant to the Agreement, employees can
only be directed to work in the Perth office when:
weather does not permit a crew change; or
an employee is required to undertake a Temporary Operations Transfer in
accordance with clause 11.5
but not in any other
circumstances.
Applicant submitted that the scheme of the Agreement contemplates that in the
event of a cyclone:
workers will be
stood down; and
will then remain
in a state of readiness to recommence work on the platform once the ‘all
clear’ has been given.
Applicant provided the following explanation of the ‘scheme’ of the

Agreement broadly intends, that is during a
cyclone which the prevents the safe
performance of work on a Platform, a worker must be:
willing and able to work, mobilise or de-mobilise; and

while it could
be said that the obligation to be ready, willing and able to work enables work
to be done in the Perth office, as facilitated
by clause 12.8, this creates
immediate conflict between clauses 12.8 and 11.9 as clause 12.8 requires that
once the work in the Perth
office is concluded, the worker must be flown back to
their place of residence, which negates the possibility of them returning to
duty immediately and would make compliance with clause 11.9
impossible;
in order to
comply with clause 12.8(a)(l) a worker would need to be flown home once
demobilised on the Platform, then flown to the
Perth office, then flown back
ready to resume duty
on the Platform. The Applicant submitted this makes little
industrial sense and no commercial sense;
clause 12.8 is
not designed to interact with clause 11.9 and cannot facilitate a worker being
utilised in the Perth office during
the language of
clause 11.9 is suggestive of a cessation of work until the ‘all
clear’ is given and at clause 11.9(b)
the obligation is to
duty immediately following the all clear, with such resumption necessarily
following cessation;
a worker cannot
resume duty after an all clear if they have continued to work during that period
and this is coupled with the Agreement
obligation that a worker will continue to
be paid for the hours “they would have worked” save for the cyclone.
The Applicant
submitted that this wording clearly contemplates that during a
cyclone a worker will be paid for hours not worked, conditional upon
and immediate resumption following the ‘all

workers covered by the Agreement with
clause 12.8 also providing terms that are
unambiguous and which make industrial sense;

supported by the
express terms of clause 6(a) of the Agreement which provides:
‘An Employee will perform all duties that are requested of them provided
they are within the Employee’s skills, competence
and training and that
it’s safe to do so’;
supported by the
term implied by law in all contracts of employment that employers possess a
fundamental right to give reasonable
directions to employees, provided those
directions are lawful and fall within the scope of the employment
relationship;
consistent with

silence in clause 11.9 to mean the parties could not exercise its right to

contract can only be excluded or diminished
by clear terms which unequivocally
express the intentions of the parties to do so and are not to be excluded or
diminished by indirect
means or ambiguous
provisions.
response to the Applicant’s submissions, the Respondent submitted that the
Applicant’s construction of the Agreement:
is inconsistent
with the commitment and philosophy reflected in clauses 2.2(b) and
prevent the Respondent from directing any employees (including remote operators)
to work from the Perth office during

would have the practical effect of requiring the platforms to be shut down,

“high degree of caution”
given enterprise agreements are documents
voted on and which must be genuinely agreed by both the employer and

requirements.
Respondent submitted that the Applicant’s submissions asserting a conflict
between clause 12.8 are unduly technical and
divorced from the industrial
reality and practical operation of the
In reference to the
Applicant’s submission that the Agreement would require a process whereby
an employee would need to be
flown home, then to Perth and then back home before
returning to the Platform, the Respondent submitted this process is artificial
and ignores the clear industrial context and practical realties of offshore
operations.
In relation to
clause 12.8 the Respondent submitted:
clear intention of the parties, as reflected in the language and structure of
the Agreement, is to provide employees with
the benefits and entitlements in

consistent with the text and purpose of the Agreement,
that where the Respondent
directs employees to perform work from the Perth office during a cyclone or
adverse weather event (and
those employees
to work), those
employees are provided with the benefits and entitlements listed in clause 12.8
and will also continue to receive
full payment of their remuneration under the

submitted that this approach gives effect to the clear and unambiguous intention
of the parties to ensure that employees
are reimbursed appropriately when
required to attend the Perth office for work, regardless of whether the need
arises from training,
meetings, or operational requirements, such as during a
the hearing the Respondent noted that clause 12.7, entitled ‘Travel to and
from the Platform’, deals specifically
with travel to and from the
Platform with different provisions set out in that clause to deal with two types
of contractual arrangements:
employee has a “Place of Residence” clause in their contract of
employment or transfer letter, which clause 12.7(a)
indicates may be the case if
they were hired or transferred into “fly in fly out” roles prior to
November 2020 and live
elsewhere in Western Australia, other states in Australia
and outside of Karratha;
employee does not have an existing contractual “Place of Residence”
entitlement.
Respondent pointed out that in respect of employees that do not have a
contractual “Place of Residence” entitlement,
clause 12.7(d)
‘Woodside will arrange and pay for air travel for Employees between Perth
and the Platform’.
Respondent submitted that this is missing from the entitlements in clause 12.7
which is applicable when an employee has an existing
contractual “Place of
Residence” entitlement because a similar clause appears in the contracts
that set out the existing
contractual “Place of Residence”
entitlement.
the hearing the Respondent submitted that:
when clause 12.7
is considered in context and read harmoniously with clause 12.8, clause 12.8
does not require the Respondent to fly
an employee home and then back to Perth
and so forth;
rather, clause
12.7 provides that where there are stood down workers working in Perth, the
Respondent is obliged to redeploy them
to the platform when the all clear is
given and those who are no longer on swing get the benefit of economy flight
fares between
the nearest Major Regional Centre from the employee’s
residence to Perth at the conclusion of the period they are required
Perth for the training, work or meetings.
Respondent submitted that when clauses 12.7 and 12.8 are read with clause 6(a)
the clear intention is that the Respondent will
meet the cost of mobilising and
demobilising workers to and from the Platform and, when they are off swing, they
will give the workers
return fares to the nearest Major Regional Centre from
their residence.
Consideration
Interpretation of
enterprise agreements
principles regarding the interpretation of enterprise agreements are well
settled. In
AMWU v Berri Pty
a Full Bench of
the Commission summarised those principles as follows:
“1. The construction of an enterprise agreement, like that of a statute or
contract, begins with a consideration of the ordinary
meaning of the relevant
words. The resolution of a disputed construction of an agreement will turn on
the language of the agreement
having regard to its context and purpose. Context
might appear from:
(i) the text of the agreement viewed as a whole;
(ii) the disputed provision’s place and arrangement in the agreement;
(iii) the legislative context under which the agreement was made and in which it
2. The task of interpreting an agreement does not involve rewriting the
agreement to achieve what might be regarded as a fair or just
outcome. The task
is always one of interpreting the agreement produced by parties.
3. The common intention of the parties is sought to be identified
objectively, that is by reference to that which a reasonable person
understand by the language the parties have used to express their agreement,
without regard to the subjective intentions or
expectations of the parties.
4. The fact that the instrument being construed is an enterprise agreement
made pursuant to Part 2-4 of the FW Act is itself an important
consideration. It may be inferred that such agreements are intended to establish
binding obligations.
5. The FW Act does not speak in terms of the ‘parties’ to
enterprise agreements made pursuant to Part 2-4 agreements,
rather it refers to
the persons and organisations who are ‘covered by’ such agreements.
Relevantly s.172(2)(a) provides
that an employer may make an enterprise
agreement ‘with the employees who are employed at the time the agreement
is made and
who will be covered by the agreement’. Section 182(1) provides
that an agreement is ‘made’ if the employees to
be covered by the
agreement ‘have been asked to approve the agreement and a majority of
those employees who cast a valid vote
approve the agreement’. This is so
because an enterprise agreement is ‘made’ when a majority of the
employees asked
to approve the agreement cast a valid vote to approve the
6. Enterprise agreements are not instruments to which the
Interpretation Act 1901
(Cth) applies, however the modes of textual analysis
developed in the general law may assist in the interpretation of enterprise
agreements. An overly technical approach to interpretation should be avoided and
consequently some general principles of statutory
construction may have less
force in the context of construing an enterprise agreement.
7. In construing an enterprise agreement it is first necessary to determine
whether an agreement has a plain meaning or it is ambiguous
or susceptible of
more than one meaning.
8. Regard may be had to evidence of surrounding circumstances to assist in
determining whether an ambiguity exists.
9. If the agreement has a plain meaning, evidence of the surrounding
circumstances will not be admitted to contradict the plain language
10. If the language of the agreement is ambiguous or susceptible of more than
one meaning then evidence of the surrounding circumstance
will be admissible to
aid the interpretation of the agreement.
11. The admissibility of evidence of the surrounding circumstances is limited
to evidence tending to establish objective background
facts which were known to
both parties which inform and the subject matter of the agreement. Evidence of
facts is to be distinguished from evidence of the
intentions of the parties, such as statements and actions of
the parties which are reflective of their actual intentions and
expectations.
12. Evidence of objective background facts will include:
(i) evidence of prior negotiations to the extent that the negotiations tend to
establish objective background facts known to all
parties and the subject matter
of the agreement;
(ii) notorious facts of which knowledge is to be presumed; and
(iii) evidence of matters in common contemplation and constituting a common
assumption.
13. The diversity of interests involved in the negotiation and making of
enterprise agreements (see point 4 above) warrants the adoption
of a cautious
approach to the admission and reliance upon the evidence of prior negotiations
and the positions advanced during the
negotiation process. Evidence as to what
the employees covered by the agreement were told (either during the course of
the negotiations
or pursuant to s.180(5) of the FW Act) may be of more
assistance than evidence of the bargaining positions taken by the employer
bargaining representative during the negotiation of the agreement.
14. Admissible extrinsic material may be used to aid the interpretation of a
provision in an enterprise agreement with a disputed
meaning, but it cannot be
used to disregard or rewrite the provision in order to give effect to an
externally derived conception
of what the parties’ intention or purpose
15. In the industrial context it has been accepted that, in some
circumstances, subsequent conduct may be relevant to the interpretation
industrial instrument. But such post-agreement conduct must be such as to show
that there has been a meeting of minds, a consensus.
Post-agreement conduct
which amounts to little more than the absence of a complaint or common
inadvertence is insufficient to establish
understanding.”
James Cook University v Ridd
the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia summarised the principles
as follows (references omitted):
“(i) The starting point is the ordinary meaning of the words, read as a
whole and in context.
(ii) A purposive approach is preferred to a narrow or pedantic approach
— the framers of such documents were likely to be of
a “practical
bent of mind”. The interpretation “turns upon the language of the
particular agreement, understood
in the light of its industrial context and
(iii) Context is not confined to the words of the instrument surrounding the
expression to be construed. It may extend to “...
the entire document of
which it is a part, or to other documents with which there is an
association”.
(iv) Context may include “... ideas that gave rise to an expression in
a document from which it has been taken”.
(v) Recourse may be had to the history of a particular clause “Where
the circumstances allow the court to conclude that a clause
in an award is the
product of a history, out of which it grew to be adopted in its present
(vi) A generous construction is preferred over a strictly literal approach,
but “Awards, whether made by consent or otherwise,
should make sense
according to the basic conventions of the English language. They bind the
parties on pain of pecuniary penalties”.
(vii) Words are not to be interpreted in a vacuum divorced from industrial
realities but in the light of the customs and working conditions
Full Court of the Federal Court in
WorkPac Pty Ltd v
articulated the
approach to be adopted as follows:
“[197] The starting point for interpretation of an enterprise agreement is
the ordinary meaning of the words, read as a whole
and in context. The
interpretation “... turns on the language of the particular agreement,
understood in the light of its industrial
context and purpose ...”. The
words are not to be interpreted in a vacuum divorced from industrial realities;
rather, industrial
agreements are made for various industries in the light of
the customs and working conditions of each, and they are frequently couched
terms intelligible to the parties but without the careful attention to form and
draftsmanship that one expects to find in an Act
of Parliament. To similar
effect, it has been said that the framers of such documents were likely of a
“practical bent of mind”
and may well have been more concerned with
expressing an intention in a way likely to be understood in the relevant
industry rather
than with legal niceties and jargon, so that a purposive
approach to interpretation is appropriate and a narrow or pedantic approach
misplaced.”
noted in the decisions referred to above, the starting point in considering the
proper interpretation of the Agreement is to consider
the ordinary meaning of
the words, read as a whole and in context.
Who does the
Agreement apply to?
4(b) of the Agreement provides that it applies to and is binding
‘Employees of the Respondent engaged to work on a Platform who are
classified within a Job Grade as set out in clause 12.2,
including those who are
on Temporary Operations Transfer’.
‘Platforms’
is defined in clause 3 to mean ‘the Goodwyn Alpha Platform’, the
North Rankin Complex and the
Angel Platform, and ‘Platforms’ means
any one of them.
pointed out by the Applicant, clause 12.4 of the Agreement sets out an
entitlement to an Offshore Allowance which is ‘designed
to compensate the
Employee for working offshore on a permanent basis’. When these provisions
are considered together, I accept
that Agreement is generally intended to
regulate the conditions of employees employed permanently, offshore on a
What does clause 11.9 do?
11.9 of the Agreement provides:
“11.9 Cyclone and Inclement Weather
In the event that Woodside’s operations are affected by a cyclone or
other adverse weather event which prevents the safe performance
of work on a
Platform, Employees will continue to be paid as usual (excluding planned
overcycle that is not worked) for the hours
they would have worked if they:
(a) are ready, willing and able to work, mobilise or demobilise; and
(b) resume duty immediately following the ‘all clear’ being
announced at Woodside’s direction.”
11.9 does not expressly prevent an employee from being directed to work in the
Perth office in the event that operations are
affected by a cyclone or other
adverse weather event that prevents the safe performance of work on a Platform.
However it is the
Applicant’s position that contextually, the Agreement
does prevent such a direction, whereas the Respondent contends that the
Agreement does not.
Applicant submitted that clause 11.9 is a stand down clause that outlines what
will happen in the event of a demobilisation and
once this is established all
other issues fall away. During the hearing the Applicant submitted that the
clause does not make sense
if workers are sent to Perth and work 12 hour shifts
in Perth as the words ‘would have worked’ and ‘resume
in clause 11.9 don’t have any work to do in the context of
that clause because employees have continued to work
throughout.
is clear from the ordinary meaning of the words in the clause that facilitation
of work from Perth during a cyclone is not the
intent of clause 11.9 and the
Respondent does not dispute this. Despite this, clause 11.9 has other work to
terms of legislative context, s. 524(1)(c) of the Act provides
(1) An employer may, under this subsection, stand down an employee during a
period in which the employee cannot be usefully employed
because of one of the
following circumstances:
(a) a stoppage of work for any cause for which the employer cannot reasonably be
held responsible.
stoppage of work caused by a cyclone preventing safe work on the platform would
meet the description of a stoppage of work for any
cause which the employer
cannot reasonably be held responsible.
pointed out by the Respondent, section 524(3) of the Act goes on to
(1) If an employer stands down an employee during a period under subsection (1),
the employer is not required to make payments to
the employee for that period.
524(2) of the Act provides that an employer
may not stand down an employee
under subsection 524(1)
during a period in which the employee cannot
usefully be employed because of a circumstance referred to in that subsection
(a) an enterprise agreement, or a contract of employment, applies to the
employer and the employee; and
(b) the agreement or contract provides for the employer to stand down the
employee during that period if the employee cannot be usefully
employed during
that period because of that circumstance.
note under subsection 524(2) provides that if an employer may not stand down an
employee under subsection (1), the employer may
be able to stand down the
employee in accordance with the enterprise agreement or the contract of
employment.
the stand down provision in s.524(1) of the Act, clause 11.9 of the Agreement
does not prescribe a right for an employer to
stand down employees during a
period in which an employee cannot be usefully employed. Nor does it create a
stand down process. Rather
it identifies a circumstance (i.e. ‘operations
are affected by a cyclone or other adverse weather event which prevents the
performance of work on a Platform’) and sets out a conditional entitlement
to be ‘paid as usual (excluding planned
overcycle that is not worked) for
the hours they would have worked’ in that circumstance.
11.9 clearly has work to do in the context of a legislative framework that
would, but for the Agreement, permit the Respondent
to stand down employees
without payment if, in the circumstance of a cyclone or adverse weather event
preventing the safe performance
of work on a Platform, they could not be
usefully be employed by the Respondent at all or where employees do not work
hours resulting in detriment to the employee. Its purpose is
to ensure that, despite the circumstance identified in the clause, the
who would ordinarily work on that Platform will not miss out on being paid in
respect of the hours they would have worked
(excluding planned overcycle that is
not worked), provided they meet certain conditions.
conditions must an employee meet to get the entitlement in clause
receive the entitlement in clause 11.9 an employee needs to be are ready,
willing and able to do the following:
demobilise.
employee clearly cannot do all three things at the same time however when they
are not mobilising and demobilising, they need to
be ready, willing and able to
work at the request of the Respondent.
next condition is that the employees need to be willing to resume duty
immediately following the ‘all clear’ being
announced at
Woodside’s direction.
Contention that an employee
cannot ‘resume duty immediately following’ the ‘all
clear’ being announced if
they have been sent to Perth
noted above, clause 11.9 provides a conditional entitlement to payment in an
identified circumstance and the Applicant has suggested
that being directed to
work from Perth negates the possibility of the employees returning to duty
immediately to meet the condition
in clause 11.9.
the hearing the Respondent submitted that this does not mean that employees have
to immediately be on the Platform within seconds
of the announcement of the
‘all clear’ but simply have to be in a position to commence
remobilisation to the Platform
in a fashion that fits within the taxi movements
of where they are (i.e. Perth office) and the airport and within the limitations
of airline charters.
purposive and generous construction should be adopted rather than an overly
literal construction that deprives employees of the
intended benefit of the
clause. Considering the purpose of clause 11.9 it cannot have been intended that
employees miss out on the
benefit of that clause because they have been asked to
do something that their employer requires of them such that they may not be
to commence work ‘immediately’ after the all clear is given in a
literal sense, i.e. because they need to make their
way back to the Platform
from Perth.
When does the Agreement contemplate working from
clause 4 makes it clear that the Agreement applies to employees engaged to work
on a Platform, there are three provisions in
the Agreement that specifically
contemplate employees working at a place other than the
Respondent pointed to clause 6(a) of the Agreement which provides that an
‘Employee will perform all duties that are requested
of them provided they
are within the Employer’s skills, competence and that it’s safe to
do so’. However, this
provision does not refer to the location from where
such duties are to be performed.
first provision in the Agreement that contemplates work at a place other than
the Platform is clause 11.4 which deals with circumstances
where the Respondent
requests that an employee change panels. Clause 11.4(i) specifically
contemplates that the Respondent may request
an employee return to the Perth
Office in circumstances where weather does not permit flights to a Platform to
perform a crew change
on a scheduled crew change day.
Agreement also specifically contemplates a requirement to work elsewhere in
circumstances involving a ‘Temporary Operations
Transfer’ in which
case clause 11.5 will apply. Clause 11.5(a) provides that:
‘From time to time, Woodside may require an Employee to undertake a
Temporary Operations Transfer to another location for a
maximum period of 24
the term ‘Temporary Operations Transfer’ is capitalised, it does not
appear to be defined in the Agreement. No party
argued that temporarily
deploying employees to Perth in the event of a cyclone or adverse weather within
the description of a ‘Temporary
the clause heading suggests, clause 12.8 contemplates training, work or meetings
in the Perth office and states:
‘(a) If an Employee who lives outside the metropolitan Perth area, and
cannot reasonably return to their residence at the end
of each working day, is
required to attend Perth for training, work or meetings, Woodside will provide:
fare flight/s between the nearest Major Regional Centre from the
Employee’s residence to Perth at the commencement and
conclusion of the
period the Employee is required to be in Perth for this training, work or
accommodation;
a travel expenses to a maximum of $230 each way (reimbursed subject to provision
of receipts or invoices through Woodside’s
reimbursement system).
Employees who live in Perth will also be entitled to this reimbursement. Where
Woodside makes cab charges
available, an Employee may elect to use a cab charge
rather than reimbursement;
Woodside does not provide a meal, a meal allowance of $153.50 whilst in transit
or in overnight accommodation. Meal Allowances
will be increased in line with
the annual publication of the Australian Taxation Office Tax Determination
(TD2023/3 at the making
of this Agreement); and
Employees to use their vehicle for travel to the airport or to attend training
or meetings, 83 cents per kilometre travelled and
for parking expenses
(including a car bay at overnight accommodation) and indexed 01 April each year
by CPI (reimbursed subject to
provision of logbook, receipts or invoices through
Woodside’s reimbursement system). Employees who live in Perth will also
entitled to this reimbursement. For clarity, an Employee my only claim under
clause 12.8(a)(iii) or 12.8(a)(v) for the same journey’.
12.8 prescribes a suite of entitlements when an employee is required to attend
Perth for training, work or meeting. Read in
the Agreement’s broader
context, and with the Agreement generally regulating the conditions of employees
employed permanently
on a Platform, clause 12.8 was likely intended to address
irregular or occasional attendance in Perth rather than attendance for
extended period as might occur in the case of a Temporary Operations Transfer.
However, it does not otherwise set out any limitations
regarding when the
Respondent can require such attendance.
Clause 12.8
chapeau to clause 12.8(a) suggests that it applies in circumstances where an
is required to
attend Perth for training, work or meetings;
lives outside
the metropolitan Perth area;
reasonably return to their residence at the end of each working
those circumstances, the Respondent ‘will provide’ the entitlements
in the clause.
12.8(a)(ii) sets out an entitlement to overnight accommodation.
12.8(iv) provides an entitlement is to a meal allowance of $153.50 in
circumstances where:
the employee is
in transit or in overnight accommodation; and
the Respondent
does not provide a meal.
an employee
live in metropolitan Perth and can reasonably be
expected to return to their residence at the end of each working day while they
attending the Perth office, clauses 12.8(a)(ii) and (iv) do not apply to
them. This is likely because it was contemplated that the
employee can stay at
their residence overnight when working in the Perth office.
travel entitlements are set out in:
12.8(a)(iii) which provides an entitlement to ‘vehicular travel expenses
to a maximum of $230 each way’ which is
to be reimbursed subject to the
provision of invoices through the Respondent’s reimbursement
clause 12.8(v)
which provides an entitlement to be paid:
per kilometre allowance in circumstances where employees use their vehicle for
travel to the airport to attend training for
meetings; and
parking expenses, including a car bay at overnight accommodation.
the chapeau to clause 12.8(a), clauses 12.8(a)(iii) and 12.8(a)(v) provide that
employees who live in Perth may also receive
entitlements under these clauses.
This is likely because when an employee is working from Perth, they will be
using their vehicle
in a way that is different to when they work on the Platform
or would otherwise be off swing and not rostered to work at all.
12.8(a)(i) sets out an entitlement to:
‘Economy fare flight/s between the nearest Major Regional Centre from the
Employee’s residence to Perth at the commencement
and conclusion of the
period the Employee is required to be in Perth for training, work or
an employee
live in metropolitan Perth and can reasonably be
expected to return to their residence at the end of each working day while they
attending the Perth office, clause 12.8(a)(i) does not apply to them.
Contention concerning clause 12.8(a)(i)
arises concerning the application of clause 12.8(a)(i). The Applicant submitted
that while it could be said that the obligation
in clause 11.9 to be ready,
willing and able to work enables work to be done in the Perth office, as
facilitated by clause 12.8,
this creates conflict between clauses 11.9 and 12.8.
The Applicant contends that to comply with clause 12.8(a)(i) an employee must
be flown home
once demobilised on the Platform;
then flown to
Perth office;
then flown back
then flown north
ready to resume on the Platform.
Applicant submitted this makes little industrial sense and no commercial sense.
The Applicant also submitted this arrangement
negates the possibility of them
returning to duty immediately as contemplated by clause 11.9.
Respondent contended that the clause was not intended to be applied as a
prescriptive, logistical manual requiring employees to
be shuttled back and
forth in the matter described by the Applicant. The Respondent submitted that
such a reading is a pedantic and
overly literal construction that deprives
Employees of the benefit of the clause if they are not first flown home once
demobilised
from the platform during a cyclone and adverse weather
the hearing the Respondent also submitted that clause 12.8 does apply if read
sensibly as a ‘catch all’ for employees
required to attend Perth for
training, meetings or, relevantly, work. The Respondent submitted that it is
often the case that workers
who are required to attend for meetings will be off
swing and the clause will operate by flying the employees to and from their
of residence in those circumstances. However, the Respondent submitted
that the clause also works for demobilised workers required
to work in Perth
because if they are at the end of their swing they will be flown back to their
place of residence.
12.8 clearly contemplates the employment of people who both live outside the
metropolitan Perth area as well as people who
‘live in Perth’ and
provides for different entitlements for each cohort. It seems likely that the
Respondent often plans
when it sends employees to Perth, such that they are
coming to work when off swing which would mean they would not be travelling
Perth part way through their roster when they would normally be on the Platform.
the North West shelf region of Western Australia is highly susceptible to
cyclones and other extreme weather systems, it is
not in dispute that the
cyclonic conditions that actually result in demobilisation (category 3 and
above) are infrequent.
unlikely that the parties had this very specific circumstance in mind when
travel under clause 12.8 was considered. But nor
does it follow that the parties
intended to
a requirement to work from Perth in this specific
circumstance. Rather, the clause is non-prescriptive about when or why the
might require an employee to work from the Perth office and it is
likely this was intended so employees receive the benefit of the
regardless of the circumstances in which the requirement to attend for training,
work or meetings is made.
accept that a literal, stand-alone application of clause 12.8(a)(i) may result
in an employee being shuttled back and forth in a
way that may give rise to
logistical inefficiency compared to travel directly between the Perth office and
the Platform. Clause 12.7(a)
clearly contemplates the employment of people who
live in states other than Western Australia, and it would be an absurd outcome
if an employee who resides in another state was required to be flown back there
before they could be returned to the platform. However,
a purposive approach is
preferred to a narrow or pedantic
and it is apparent that
clause 12.8(a)(i) was only intended to provide an entitlement when people are
required to travel between
Perth and their residence outside the metropolitan
Perth area. In my view it is not intended to have application in circumstances
where employees are required to travel between two different places of work,
being the Platform and Perth office.
Does the Agreement deal
with travel between Perth and a Platform?
clause 12.8(a)(i) does not provide the answer, residual questions arise around
how employees are to get between two places of work,
being a Platform and the
Perth office and whether the answers can be found in the
text above clause 12.7(a) states ‘Existing contractual “Place of
Residence” entitlement’. Clause 12(a)
sets out an acknowledgement
that employees hired or transferred into “fly in fly pout” roles
prior to November 2020 may
have a “Place of Residence” clause in
their contract of employment or transfer letter and “may live elsewhere in
WA, other states in Australia and outside the City of
12.7(b) sets out provisions that apply if an employee’s contract of
employment contains such a clause. This includes
clause 12.7(b)(i) which has the
effect that travel to Perth will be in the Employee’s own time and will be
12.7(b)(ii) provides that:
the Respondent
will meet the cost of a return economy flight from the Major Regional Centre or
capital city nearest to for employees
whose permanent place of residence is
located outside of Western Australia to Perth;
the Respondent
will meet the cost of a return economy flight from the closet Major Regional
Centre to Perth for employees whose permanent
place of residence is located
outside of the Perth metropolitan area but within Western
12.7(b) goes on to say:
‘Flight bookings will be made based on an Employee’s permanent place
of residence. The expectation is that Employees
will board all flights booked in
line with the roster arrangement, Flight bookings will be made in advance and
provided on the basis
of the optimal flight route to return the Employee to
their nominated place of residence as quicky as possible after demobilisation.
They will not be subject to temporary or ad-hoc changes except in limited
circumstances.’
is clear from clause 12.7(b) that it is concerned with fly in fly out employees
who fly between their residence outside of Perth
and the Platform. Like clause
12.8(a)(i), it is neither designed nor intended to deal with flights between the
Platform and Perth
when an employee is required to travel from the Platform to
work in Perth.
text above clause 12.7(d) states:
No contractual “Place of Residence”
entitlement
It is apparent that clauses 12.7(d) – (f) that appear below this
text were intended to apply in circumstances where an employee
does not have a
“Place of Residence” clause in their contract.
12.7(d) requires the Respondent to ‘arrange and pay for air travel for
Employees between Perth and the Platform’.
The wording of the provision is
clear, and the Respondent is required to do what the clause says in respect of
an employee does not
have a “Place of Residence” clause in their
respect of employees who have a contractual “Place of Residence”
entitlement, clause 12.7(b)(ii) provides for travel
to Perth from an
employee’s residence but it does not deal with travel from Perth to a
noted above, the Respondent submitted that this is missing from the entitlements
in clause 12.7 which is applicable when an employee
has an existing contractual
“Place of Residence” entitlement because a similar clause appears in
the contracts that set
out the existing contractual “Place of
Residence” entitlement. However, no contracts were provided as evidence to
this submission and in those circumstances, I am unable to make a
finding about that.
observe that it would seem peculiar to meet the cost of flying between Perth and
the Platform for some employees and not others.
I also observe that in
circumstances where an employee is directed to move between their usual place of
work on the Platform and
another place of work, s.325 of the Act may be relevant
and if it were expected that the employee meet the cost of such travel, it
also impact an assessment of whether any such direction is lawful and
reasonable. Such an assessment is outside the scope of
the Commission’s
powers in this dispute and would likely require consideration of the specific
circumstances in which a particular
direction is
11.9 and 12.8(a) are directed at different purposes:
the case of clause 11.9, its purpose is to ensure that, despite operations being
affected by a cyclone or other adverse weather
event which prevents the safe
performance of work on a Platform, the affected employees will not miss out on
being paid in respect
of the hours they would have worked, provided they meet
the conditions set out in this clause.
the case of clause 12.8(a) its purpose is to provide relevant travel, meal and
accommodation entitlements when an employee is,
on occasion, required to work in
Perth office rather than the Platform where they normally
the clauses are construed with these different purposes in mind, it does not
lead to a conclusion that the Agreement was intended
to prevent the Respondent
from directing its employees to work from its Perth office if operations are
affected by a cyclone or other
adverse weather event. Rather, a purposive
approach supports a construction where clauses 12.8 and 11.9 operate
independently to
address two different sets of circumstances. It may be the case
that these circumstances that exist at the same time in which case
entitlements in both clauses are triggered.
noted above, there is no express prohibition on the Respondent issuing a
direction to an employee to work from Perth in the Agreement
in circumstances
where operations are affected by a cyclone or other adverse weather event which
prevents the safe performance of
work on a platform. Further, it cannot be
implied from an absence of a specific provision dealing with deployment to Perth
circumstances that the Respondent is unable to issue such a direction.
The text of the Agreement does not support such a construction
and nor does not
it displace the contractual right to give reasonable directions to employees,
provided those directions are lawful
and fall within the scope of the employment
relationship.
have earlier made findings about what work clause 11.9 has to do and have found
that the Agreement does not prevent the Respondent
from directing its employees
to work from its Perth office in the event that the Respondent’s
operations are affected by a
cyclone or other adverse weather event which
prevents the safe performance of work on a platform. Considering the limitations
the Commission’s jurisdiction, the dispute should be considered
resolved on this basis.
the dispute is ultimately about whether the Respondent is able to direct
employees to work in its Perth office if operations
are impacted by a cyclone or
other adverse weather event which impacts the safe performance of work on a
platform. Notwithstanding
the resolution of the dispute about the Agreement, and
as noted by the Respondent, there may still be a live issue as to whether
Respondent is empowered (under the express or implied terms of the
employees’ contracts) to issue such a direction which
is a matter beyond
the scope of the Commission’s jurisdiction in this
I have earlier observed
that whether a direction is lawful and reasonable may depend on the factual
circumstances in which the direction
resolved the dispute about the Agreement, the parties may wish to engage in
further discussions independently of the Commission
to see if they can arrive at
a mutual understanding about any contractual rights concerning such a direction
and related practical
considerations.
