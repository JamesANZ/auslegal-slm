REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
This is a decision in an
application by Christopher John Stowers to review a decision of the Plumbers and
Drainers Board to refuse
to Mr Stowers’ application for a Plumber’s
Licence and a Drainer’s Licence under the
Plumbing and Drainage Act
(the "P&D Act").
section 101
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(the "CCT Act") the tribunal
may review a decision for which the tribunal is given jurisdiction to review
under an empowering Act.
The P&D Act is an empowering Act. Under Part 7,
Division 1 of the P&D Act, the tribunal is given jurisdiction to review
decision of the Board to refuse to grant a licence.
From 20 August 2004 until 1
September 2005 Mr Stowers held a Provisional Plumber’s Licence and a
Provisional Drainer’s
Licence issued by the Board.
Mr Stowers had applied to the
Board for the licences on 11 July 2005. The Board’s decision to refuse
the application was made
on or about 24 October 2005.
Mr Stowers completed his
apprenticeship with the firm of E A Watts Pty Ltd on 20 January 1977. However,
he was never issued with
trade papers as a plumber or drainer, owing to the fact
that he did not complete two modules of study at Heidelberg Technical College,
namely Mathematics and Gas fitting.
Mr Stowers has never been
licensed as a plumber or drainer in Victoria. In Queensland he has held the
provisional licences referred
For most of the period since
the completion of his apprenticeship Mr Stowers has been employed in a variety
of roles, including extensively
in performing plumbing and draining work.
Requirements for licensing
There is no question that his
practical experience in plumbing work is sufficient to satisfy the requirement
for practical experience
under section 37(a) of the P&D Act.
However, to qualify for the
licences, Mr Stowers must also satisfy the qualifications requirements under
that section. These are
set out in Schedule 1 to the
Plumbing and Drainage
Regulation 2003
, referred to in
of the Regulation.
Mr Stowers does not have the
trade papers which would establish his qualification in the competencies in his
plumbing and draining
apprenticeship. Nor does he have a certificate of
competency, a foreign licence of an equivalent qualification.
It follows that the decision
of the Board to refuse his application appears to have been correct.
I note that on 24 October
2005 (and again today) the Board offered to reconsider Mr Stowers’
application for the licences, if
Mr Stowers obtained the relevant certificates
of competency from a TAFE college.
Mr Stowers is yet to make
enquiries about the time and effort involved in obtaining such certificates. He
declined the suggestion
that his application for review be adjourned for a
period to allow him to seek them.
In the circumstances, the
order of the tribunal will be that the application for review is dismissed.
