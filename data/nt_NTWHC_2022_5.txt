AUSSIEMOVE INTERNATIONAL MOVERS PTY LTD
REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 3 March 2022)
JUDGE GREG MACDONALD
13 October 2015 Mr Akouete Gbekou (the Worker), while employed by Aussiemove
International Movers Pty Ltd (the Employer), sustained
a back injury for which
he made a claim for workers compensation. The Employer, through its insurer,
accepted liability for the injury
dispute giving rise to the proceedings began on 5 June 2018, through the
Employer’s insurer, QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited,
writing to the
Worker requiring that he provide a medical certificate within 14 days. No
certificate was provided and in July 2018
the employer ceased payment of weekly
benefits to the Worker in accordance with
(aa) of the
(the Act). The dispute proceeded through mediation and a tortuous
procedural course, with the claim ultimately proceeding to a contested
on 7 June 2021. On that date the Worker had some resort to counsel from the
independent bar, Mr Simon Lipert, who was good
enough to accept an amicus role
to assist. That step had been facilitated by the Employer’s solicitors in
the circumstances
of the difficulties which conduct of the Worker’s case
was prone to present, and the court was grateful for the efforts of
and Minter Ellison’s facilitation.
7 June 2021, despite procedural directions given together with guidance provided
to the Worker, he was ultimately in a position
of being unwilling or unable to
call any medical evidence as to injury and incapacity. The Worker’s
predicament was no doubt
unassisted by English being very much his second
language. However, the court ensured the presence of a French interpreter on the
day of the hearing, and other measures were also taken in relation to procedural
requirements leading to hearing, particularly, by
the Registrar, towards
enabling the Worker to prosecute his
addition to the language barrier, conduct of the matter was not assisted by
various other aspects, including movement of the Worker’s
representation
from firm to firm. The Worker was entirely unassisted and self-represented in
the Employer’s application for
costs made 17 December
7 June 2021 the Orders made included leave to the Worker to withdraw his claim,
and liberty to apply. The latter order was in the
context that the
Employer’s lawyers then needed to provide advice and obtain instructions
on the question of costs.
Application &
13 October 2021 Minter Ellison lodged a Re-List application to Chambers, seeking
a date for argument on and determination of the
question of costs. The Registrar
liaised with the Worker and the matter was ultimately listed on 17 December
17 December the Employer’s application was for a costs order under
of the Act read in conjunction with r23.03 of the
Work Health Court Rules
(WHC Rules) and Order 63 of the
Supreme Court Rules 1987
Rules), that the Worker pay the Employer’s costs fixed in the lump sum of;
$45,000; or $22,700; or such other sum as the
Those orders in the
alternative were sought instead of the usual ‘taxed or agreed’
order, due to the circumstances of
the Worker, the issues involved in the
proceeding, respective conduct of the parties, the manner in which the
proceeding resolved,
and the further time and resources which agreeing or taxing
of any costs order would entail.
Employer relied on an Affidavit sworn by Mr Lachlan Baird of Minter Ellison on
16 December 2021 and also provided written submissions
on 17 December 2021. The
Affidavit deposed that the Employer had expended $72,480 in professional and
counsel fees.
In addition, the
Affidavit annexed counsel’s memoranda of fees and various correspondence
engaged in between the parties for
the purpose of resolution of the proceeding
by agreement.
Worker made clear to the court on 17 December that he wanted all issues to be
finally determined by the court, and did not wish
for the application to be
adjourned to enable legal advice on the Affidavit or submissions, or to be heard
in relation to that material.
Despite the court’s reservations concerning
the Worker’s capacity to fully appreciate and understand the essential
and likely consequences involved, it became necessary to proceed. The
application was then adjourned to 3 March 2022 for
Rule 23.03 of the WHC Rules provides;
23.03 Power and
discretion of Court
(1) Subject to the Act, these Rules and any other law in force in the
Territory, the costs of and incidental to a proceeding are
in the Court's
discretion and the Court has the power to determine by whom, to whom, to what
extent and on what basis the costs are
to be paid.
(2) The Court may exercise its power and discretion in relation to costs
at any stage of a proceeding or after the conclusion of
a proceeding.
(3) In exercising its discretion under this rule in relation to a
proceeding commenced under section 104 of the Act, the Court must
have regard to
the matters referred to in section 110 of the Act.
23.03 is conditioned on “
subject to the Act
”, so s 110 of the
Act is potentially relevant. Section 110 provides;
In awarding costs in a proceeding before the Court, the Court shall take
into account the efforts of the parties made before or after
the making of the
application under section 104 in attempting to come to an agreement about the
matter in dispute and it may, as
it thinks fit, include as costs in the action
such reasonable costs of a party incurred in or in relation to those efforts,
in particular the efforts made at the directions hearing and any
conciliation conference.
Ellison’s Affidavit sworn 16 December 2021 deposes to extensive efforts on
the part of the Employer to resolve the proceeding
by agreement. It might
legitimately be submitted that the Employer (and Worker) should prudently have
sought to resolve the dispute
at an earlier juncture, and been more persistent
and consistent throughout conduct of the proceeding in that vein. However, I
that the Amended Statement of Claim was not filed until 19 March 2020 and
that earnest negotiations were underway by July 2020. Ultimately,
concluded that s 110 could only have a minimal role in determination of the
question of costs.
three issues for decision are, firstly, whether a costs order in favour of the
Employer should be made. Second, whether any costs
order should be made in a

so, in what quantum.

is of no assistance to recognise that the Worker was self-represented at some
crucial junctures in the litigation, or that he
is very likely
impecunious.
also note that SC Rule 63.11(6) providing that “
a party who
discontinues a proceeding or withdraws part of a proceeding... shall pay the

Employer at paragraph [14] of its written submissions of 17 December 2021
submits a range of factors as to why it would be appropriate
to make the
inevitable costs order in a “
gross amount

respectfully disagree with the proposition that the case was
relatively straightforward
straightforward
”, I accept the Employer’s propositions in
support of the costs order being in the form of a “
difficulties, expense, and likely waste of further time and resources indicate a
costs order in the form sought would also generally
be in the interests of
administration of justice.
is also noted that, unless made in indemnity or ‘solicitor and
client’ terms, a cost order is never a complete indemnity
to a successful
litigant’s costs liability. However, any full costs order should
approximate reasonable compensation for the
costs and disbursements incurred.
Ranged against that, in matters where a gross or lump-sum amount is sought, the
court must be vigilant
so as to not penalise the unsuccessful litigant.
Ultimately, any amount awarded in the circumstances must be fair and
reasonable.
is accepted that the Employer’s gross costs incurred amount to $72,480,
which amount is the total expenditure on professional
fees and disbursements, so
may be characterised as the ‘indemnity amount’. On 17 December 2021
it was said that the lowest
lump-sum amount sought by the Employer, being
$22,700, was a figure arrived at by application of a reduction in the vicinity
Even on a particularly rigorous taxation, and having regard to factors
adverse to the Employer’s optimal position on the reasonableness
and disbursements incurred, a reduction of that magnitude would be very
unlikely. Doing the best I can, I apply a reduction
of 50%, which produces a
