certain information under section 38 in conjunction with 104ZZA of the

Review application

have examined a copy of the document subject to review. I note that of the 30
pages, only 15 pages contain content. The other pages
are blank and only
included based on how the document was formatted and/or scanned by the
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section
49H(2) in relation to the review.
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
Initial view
[date], OVIC staff provided the Applicant with an initial view that if this
matter proceeded to a formal decision, an OVIC Commissioner
would likely uphold
the Agency’s decision. OVIC asked whether the Applicant would agree to
withdraw the review.
response to the initial view, the Applicant advised they wanted the review to
continue to a formal decision.

secrecy provision.
document is exempt under section 38 if three requirements are met:
(a) there is an enactment that is in force
(b) the enactment applies specifically to information contained in the

information.

enactment refer specifically to the information in the document?
to apply to a document, an enactment must be formulated with such
precision that it specifies the actual information sought to be

disclose personal or confidential information unless authorised

personal or confidential information unless that use or disclosure
is authorised

Penalty: 120 penalty units.
term ‘personal or confidential information’ is defined in
Corrections Act
and includes the following, which I consider is
relevant in this matter:
(c) information –
(i) that identifies any person or discloses his or her address or location made
by the person; or
(ii) from which any person’s identity, address or location can be
reasonably determined;
(j) information concerning –
(i) security systems and security measures in, or in relation to, a prison;
relation to this, the Agency’s decision letter states:
case, the following material fits the definition of personal or confidential
information:
The names of
staff, their titles and signatures is information that identifies a person;
The names and/or
any other identifying information of other offenders; and
Details about
the CCTV cameras and their identification numbers is information that concerns
the security and management of prisons.
reviewed the information the Agency has exempted, I am satisfied that it
comprises ‘personal or confidential information’
within the meaning
section 104ZX
Corrections Act
as it relates to information which
identifies a person as well as information about the security and management of
the prison.
Does the enactment prohibit persons referred to from
disclosing the information?
Corrections Act
imposes strict confidentiality requirements on
Agency officers, among others, which apply in all but certain limited
circumstances.
Corrections Act
prohibits ‘a person who is or has been a
relevant person’ from disclosing ‘personal or confidential
information’
unless authorised.
phrase ‘relevant person’ is set out in Schedule 5 and includes
‘[a] person employed in the Department under
Administration Act 2004
such, the Agency is a ‘relevant person’ for the purposes of
Corrections Act
Corrections Act
out exceptions to the prohibition on relevant persons disclosing ‘personal
or confidential information’.
reviewed these exceptions, there is no information before me to suggest an
exception applies to authorise disclosure of the
requested information to the
Applicant in this instance.
am therefore satisfied that

all three limbs described above have been met, I am satisfied the information
redacted by the Agency is exempt from release under
– Deletion of exempt or irrelevant
information

is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant information
and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
whether it is ‘practicable’ to delete exempt or irrelevant
information requires an agency or Minister to consider:
(a) the effort involved in making the deletions from a resources point of
(b) the effectiveness of those deletions – that is, whether the edited
document still has meaning.
my decision is the same as the Agency’s decision and it granted access to
the documents in part in accordance with
, I consider it remains
practicable to provide the Applicant with an edited copy of the document with
exempt information deleted.
the information before me, I am satisfied certain information in the document is
exempt from release under
in conjunction with
section 104ZZA
