EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICE BODY-WORN CAMERAS IN
DOMESTIC AND FAMILY VIOLENCE INCIDENTS
ISHRAT ZAMAN
I INTRODUCTION
While police body-worn cameras (‘BWC’) have been increasingly
used across Australian states and territories in police
responses to domestic
and family violence (‘DFV’) incidents, the capacity of body-worn
video (‘BWV’) evidence
in strengthening the credibility of
victim-survivors in DFV incidents is subject to limitations, and it is doubtful
as to whether
this evidence can improve the likelihood of securing a guilty
verdict against alleged perpetrators in trials. This article seeks
to answer two
critical questions via a rapid systematic review – first, how BWV evidence
may affect the assessment of credibility
of victim-survivors in DFV incidents
within the criminal process; and second, whether the inclusion of BWV evidence
in criminal trials
increases the victim-survivor’s prospects of attaining
a guilty verdict against the alleged perpetrator. Part II will provide
background for the recent adoption of BWCs in DFV incidents throughout
Australia. Parts III and IV will detail the method used
to answer the research
questions, and the limitations of the method, respectively. Part V will explore
and analyse the key findings
of the rapid systematic review for each research
question. This article will adopt a feminist framework to account for the
nature of DFV.

incidents has grown over the past decade in part as a response

By conducting a rapid
systematic review, this article attempts to synthesize the literature regarding
the utility of BWV evidence
from DFV incidents within the criminal process.
III METHODS
A rapid systematic review of literature on the usage of BWCs in DFV incidents
was implemented to answer the research questions of
this project. An eligibility
criteria was established to determine what articles were acceptable for
incorporation in the review.
The eligibility criteria required articles to
evaluate the actual or perceived utility of BWV evidence in the criminal
process; address
BWV evidence in the context of DFV circumstances; address the
Australian context; and be published in English to be included in the

The Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 Statement
(‘PRISMA’) was used as a guideline
for the rapid systematic review
to ensure that the review was thoroughly
undertaken.
The databases selected to execute the rapid systematic review include the
Australian Institute of Criminology (‘AIC’),
BOCSAR, Informit AGIS
Plus Text, HeinOnline, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and EBSCO. A total of 14
articles were eligible for
inclusion in the review. Figure 1.1 below depicts the
results of the searches for each database.

the rapid systematic review
The rapid systematic review was conducted using a feminist framework. A
feminist framework was adopted to account for the gendered
dynamics of DFV,
whilst acknowledging how gender norms and myths may influence stakeholders in
the criminal justice system to develop
assumptions on the credibility of
victim-survivors. The report will draw upon strands of thinking from liberal
feminist and intersectional
feminist theory to guide the analysis of the key
findings where appropriate. Liberal feminist theory posits individuals as
and equal beings who obtain the right to having freedom in the
‘private’ sphere such as within households, while intersectional
feminist theory recognises the importance of accounting for the effect of social
identities beyond gender in feminism, such as race,
religion or social

V KEY FINDINGS
A The Impact of BWV Evidence on the Assessment of
Credibility of Victim-Survivors
The findings on whether BWV evidence affects the assessment of credibility of
victim-survivors in DFV incidents, and the biases and
limitations associated
with the evidence will be addressed by accounting for the perspectives and
involvement of key stakeholders
in shaping BWV evidence. These stakeholders
include the victim-survivor, the police, the perpetrator, the judicial system
and prosecutors.
Victim-Survivor
While several studies observed victim-survivors were optimistic on the
capacity of BWV evidence to provide objective evidence and
hold perpetrators
accountable, victim-survivors noted that deviation from the standards of an
‘ideal victim’, trauma
and the inability of BWCs to capture
non-physical harm may diminish the credibility of victim-survivors or contribute
to their misidentification
as the aggressor in a DFV
Notably, a study
conducted by Iliadis et al (2024) found that most victim-survivors believed that
evidence from BWCs could objectively
document the abuse and effects of DFV on
victim-survivors in video form.
Similarly, Petersen and Lu (2023) recognised that BWV evidence had the capacity
to effectively document physical injuries sustained
by victim-survivors, as well
as record statements from victim-survivors contemporaneously at the
This could be used to
enhance the perceived credibility of victim survivors in the criminal
Many victim-survivors
also thought that the evidence could effectively hold perpetrators accountable
This notion was
reinforced by Iliadis et al (2024) in a survey completed in 2020 by Australian
police officers, DFV stakeholders
and victim-survivors, where several survey
participants acknowledged the evidentiary value of BWCs in providing an
objective viewpoint
The survey respondents
also found value in the ability of BWCs to portray harm inflicted on children,
who may support the victim-survivor’s
credibility through exhibiting
visceral reactions to the DFV incident, such as screaming or
Hence, BWV evidence may
have probative value that could strengthen the credibility of victim-survivors
within the criminal process.
However, victim-survivors in the studies also acknowledged critical
limitations of BWC evidence, asserting that the ‘ideal victim’
stereotype may affect how police and juries interpret BWC evidence from DFV
incidents and make negative assumptions on their
credibility.
First conceived by
Nils Christie in 1986, the stereotype of the ‘ideal victim’ has
several key attributes, requiring
victims to appear as vulnerable, be engaged in
reputable conduct when first being victimised by a ‘big bad
not known to them and have no culpability for being victimised
by the alleged offender.
conception of the ‘ideal victim’ reflects traditional Western gender
norms of masculinity and femininity, with female
victims considered
‘weaker’ compared to men, who are stereotypically perceived as
strong and dominant.
Judges/juries and police officers who rely on gendered assumptions of the
‘ideal victim’ may appraise victim-survivors
of DFV as less credible
in BWV evidence if they deviate from this
stereotype.
For example, several
studies in the review identified that victim-survivors that contravene the
‘ideal victim’ stereotype
by retaliating against perpetrators with
force to defend themselves or behaving hysterically in BWV evidence may seem
less credible
and could be viewed as criminally responsible for the incident,
which may result in the misidentification of victim-survivors as
This could cause
devastating miscarriages of justice for victim-survivors, who may be wrongfully
charged or face civil orders or
criminal repercussions from the BWC recording of
the incident.
These outcomes
were recognised by Iliadis et al (2024), where three victim-survivor
participants in the study reported being misunderstood
and treated like the
primary aggressor when police responded to the incident due to their heightened
emotional states, with one victim-survivor
served as respondent with a
protection order by the police.
Hence, this reiterates the necessity for viewers of BWV evidence to observe the
footage through a domestic violence lens to appropriately
appreciate the nature
of DFV and draw informed conclusions on the credibility of the
victim-survivor.
Furthermore, viewers of BWV footage in the criminal justice system who are
unaware of the effects of psychological and neural trauma
on the behaviour and
communication skills of victim-survivors in DFV incidents may draw inaccurate
conclusions on a victim-survivor’s
credibility.
The cognitive
skills of victim-survivors may be adversely affected by injuries sustained from
Notably, victim-survivors
who sustain injuries to their head or body from DFV may suffer from traumatic
brain injury, the effects
of which may cause amnesia, emotional dysregulation
and difficulties associated with concentrating and communicating with
Consequently, the
effects of neurological and psychological trauma could cause victim-survivors to
provide a disjointed testimony
in BWV evidence due to difficulties with
recalling events accurately, and exhibit hostility in their demeanour if
entering into a
dissociative
A lack of consistency
between statements made in BWV evidence and the testimony of victim-survivors in
court could reduce the fact
finder’s perceived credibility of the
victim-survivor as a witness.
While incoherent testimonies from victim-survivors have been recognised as more
reliable in DFV cases, judges or juries could lack
awareness of this and may
evaluate the victim-survivor as less
Thus, it is essential
for courts to properly understand the effects of trauma on the testimony and
demeanour of victim-survivors
in BWV evidence to make an informed assessment on
their credibility.
Finally, BWV evidence has been criticised for its inability to capture the
full impact of DFV. While BWCs may be able to document
physical abuse, it is
difficult for BWCs to encapsulate the effects of coercive control, non-physical
harm and the broader pattern
of DFV inflicted on the
victim-survivor.
As a result,
the evidentiary value of BWV footage could be reduced depending on what types of
abuse or behaviour the BWC can capture
in a single DFV incident, which may be
insufficient at enforcing the victim-survivor’s
credibility.
The credibility of
victim-survivors could be adversely affected if BWCs only depict verbal or
emotional abuse, as opposed to physical
abuse, which judges/juries and the
police may not consider as DFV.
The lack of recognition of verbal or emotional abuse and patterns of coercive
control as DFV on behalf of police officers and judges/juries
is symbolic of the
division between the ‘public’ and ‘private’ sphere in
liberal feminist theory, and the
reluctance of states to interfere with matters
in the ‘private’
The tenets of liberal
feminism are reflected in the unwillingness of police to interfere in scenarios
occurring privately in households
where victim-survivors may face serious
non-physical harm, which may result from police perceptions that this type of
harm is less
credibility of victim-survivors may be undermined by the limitations of BWCs in
portraying isolated incidents of DFV and
being unable to capture non-physical
forms of abuse that victims may
Police Officers
While police officers play a significant role in recording DFV incidents
using BWCs, police discretion over activating BWCs, camera

understanding and attitude towards the dynamics of DFV can affect the usefulness
of BWV evidence in being capable
of enhancing the victim-survivor’s
credibility.
BWCs have been
praised by police for their ability to provide an additional source of evidence
in DFV incidents which could assist

partially recording or exercising discretion to not record certain events at a
DFV incident, police officers might inadvertently
affect the quality of BWV
evidence obtained, which could misrepresent victim-survivors and adversely
affect the credibility of their
statements made in BWV
Given that police
agencies are still male-dominated institutions, this creates the risk that
stakeholders may interpret BWV evidence
through a patriarchal lens, which may
cause victim-survivors to face gender biases and gender-based
discrimination.
Additionally, cognitive biases and camera view biases from the BWV footage
may detrimentally impact the credibility of victim-survivors.
Although BWV
evidence has been commended by police for the neutral perspective it provides in
DFV incidents, this assumption has
several major
weaknesses.
The objectivity that
BWCs have been proclaimed to portray may be undermined by ‘camera view
bias’, since the DFV incident
is recorded from the narrow camera range of
the officer’s perspective and may not capture critical moments that fall
of the camera’s
Further, the quality of
the footage obtained may be impacted by various factors, such as lighting,
camera angles and steadiness of
Excessive speed and
movement captured in footage may lead to ‘deceptive intensity’
biases, which could contribute to
the misinterpretation of evidence that could
adversely affect a victim-survivor’s
credibility.
Moreover, Pfitzner,
Walklate and McCulloch (2023) assert police may develop different views of the
DFV incident after rewatching
BWV evidence compared to their views when first
arriving at the scene, diminishing the capabilities of BWV evidence to provide
objective perspective of the
These factors may
impact the quality of the footage and cause stakeholders to interpret the
footage differently based on what they
are able to
The interpretation of BWV evidence may also be affected by cognitive biases
held by the viewer, such as social and cultural demographic
This reiterates the
necessity of adopting an intersectional feminist lens when interpreting BWV
evidence, in order to account for
intersectional factors like culture, religion
and ethnicity to help judges/juries understand variations in the lived
experiences
of DFV across different
demographics.
This may assist in
combating cognitive biases which pose threats to the credibility of
victim-survivors from diverse
backgrounds.
Thus, the effect of
biases on the footage may affect how courts and the police perceive the
credibility of victim-survivors in BWV
The evidentiary value of BWC footage may also be impacted by the quality and
quantity of footage recorded by police
A systematic narrative
review conducted by Pfitzner, Walklate and McCulloch (2023) found there is
widespread consensus that recording
police interviews immediately after DFV
incidents may enable police to obtain victim statements with higher accuracy
since they are
filmed soon after the incident
Consequently, an onus is
imposed on police to interview victim-survivors to attain a thorough statement
from them to maximise their
credibility.
However, the
utility of BWV evidence containing statements from victim-survivors depends on
the adeptness of police at interviewing
victim-survivors.
Further, the
quantity of footage may be lacking if police officers prematurely de-activate
BWCs when believing that the primary aggressor
does not pose a threat to

responding to DFV incidents if they are affected by trauma

Police failure to

This emphasises the
necessity for a trauma-based understanding when assisting victim-survivors to
avoid drawing adverse conclusions
on their credibility and indicates police may
require more training to effectively aid victim-survivors in DFV
As reinforced by
liberal feminist thinking, police who do not believe the testimonies of
victim-survivors as credible may re-victimise

reinforcing the structural gender discrimination women victim-survivors have
historically encountered when
seeking help from law enforcement for

Perpetrators
The utility of BWV evidence in promoting the credibility of the
victim-survivor may be obscured by perpetrators of DFV, who could
manipulate the footage by changing their image when police arrive and start
recording on BWCs. Five out of fourteen (36%)

The Judicial System
Since courts have traditionally been patriarchal and gendered institutions,
judges and juries may have a poorer understanding of the

victim-survivors.

Prosecutors
While studies in this review demonstrate that prosecutors are supportive of
the use of BWV footage in trials for its capacity to emotively
judge/jury and promote the credibility of victim-survivors, this view fails to
encapsulate the deficiencies of BWV evidence
in depicting the emotional
responses of victim-survivors. A study has shown that prosecutors in Australia
and New Zealand believe
recording the statements of victim-survivors may boost
their credibility in the eyes of the judge/jury due to the ability of BWCs

believed that portrayal of the victim-survivor’s emotions may influence

However, this notion relies on the social constructs of women being more

mentioned, trauma

Hence, myths surrounding
the expected demeanour of victim-survivors in the court system may decrease the
credibility of victim-survivors
and impose further barriers to convicting
alleged perpetrators.
B The Relationship Between BWV Evidence and Guilty Verdicts
for Perpetrators
Although proponents of BWCs were hopeful that including BWV evidence in
trials would increase the number of early guilty pleas and
guilty verdicts,
studies across Australia have shown ambiguity on whether BWV footage can achieve

and United Kingdom have observed a positive correlation between the use of BWCs
and guilty pleas or verdicts,
Australian studies have produced conflicting

Based on these results, it is difficult to draw conclusions on whether BWV
evidence is positively correlated with guilty pleas and
verdicts in the criminal
justice system. More research should be undertaken across all Australian state
and territories to determine
whether BWV evidence may improve rates of early
guilty pleas and guilty verdicts in the criminal justice system.
VI CONCLUSION
Though advocates of BWCs have supported the use of the technology for its
capacity to expand the evidentiary base for victim-survivors
in DFV incidents,
this rapid systematic review reveals that both advantages and pitfalls exist
with using BWV evidence to improve
the assessment of credibility of
victim-survivors and portrays ambiguous results as to whether BWCs can increase
prospects of securing
guilty pleas or verdicts against perpetrators. Within a
feminist framework, the findings of the review exhibit that while BWV evidence
may provide objective evidence to hold perpetrators accountable, cognitive
biases, camera view biases, gendered assumptions and misunderstandings
surrounding the impact of trauma on victim-survivors could concurrently operate
to negatively affect the assessment of credibility
of victim-survivors.
Moreover, while some Australian studies indicated the possibility that BWCs
could be positively correlated with
guilty verdicts and pleas, others have shown
diverging results. This review underscores the need to conduct further research
to comprehensively
evaluate the utility of BWV evidence in DFV incidents within
the criminal process in Australia.
