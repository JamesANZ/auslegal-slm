PRESIDING MEMBER:
MR F. TENNI
ORIGINATING DOCUMENTS:
Application for costs
APPEARANCES:
Mr Marzella of Counsel for the Applicant
Respondents in Person.
DATE OF HEARING:
15 September, 1997
DATE OF DETERMINATION:
16 September, 1997
REASONS FOR DECISION:
An offer of settlement was put by the builder, Oasis Homes, to the owners, Mr
& Mrs Miner, on 30 April, 1997. The hearing commenced
on 5 May, 1997. The
owners rejected the offer of settlement. At the end of the hearing I made an
order which was more favourable
to the builder than the terms of his offer to
the owners.
Mr Marzella now seeks an order under Section 103(2) of the Domestic Building
Contracts and Tribunal Act 1995 for "all" costs incurred
after the offer was
made. Mr Marzella submitted that the word "all" in the sub-section meant
exactly that and the builder is not
restricted by any scale of costs or even by
the reasonability of any payment made by it for such as witness or counsel
Section 4 (b) of the Act states the objective of resolving disputes as
quickly, efficiently and cheaply as possible. With that as
a guideline I
believe the word "all" in Section 103 (2) must be given a restricted meaning. I
believe costs should be awarded at
the appropriate scale with an allowance
beyond that for extra costs that have been reasonably incurred having regard to
of fairness. I determine that the appropriate scale is Scale D of the
Magistrates’ Court Civil Procedure Rules - SR 143/1996.
Mr Eric Riegler, Solicitor in the firm of Minter Ellison, solicitors for the
builder, has prepared an affidavit, enclosing copies
of six periodic accounts
for costs sent to the builder. These accounts were for professional services
and disbursements, of which
the claims for professional services totalled
Miss Margaret Jane Rollo, Solicitor and independent cost consultant, gave
evidence that she examined the Minter Ellison file in this
matter and checked it
against the claims made by Mr Riegler. Based on the Magistrates’ Court
Scale D she believes an amount
of $3000 should be allowed. I am in agreement
with this amount which includes an amount of $140 for preparation of a witness
of a Mr Murray Jennings. I believe that statement was a necessary
part of the preparation of the case. I indicated during the hearing
costs application that I would not make an order for costs of Mr Jennings’
appearance at the hearing as he was not called
as a witness.
The copies of accounts produced by Mr Riegler sought refund of disbursements
totalling $453.30. The claim for courier fees having
been withdrawn, I allow
$354.10 for disbursements. I do not allow the claim for the cost of a certified
extract of a conviction.
Mr Stanley Baker who gave evidence as a building expert seeks costs at an
hourly rate of $150. He also claims $600 for each of three
sessions of the
hearing which he attended. I believe those three sessions occupied eight hours
of time and I will allow eight hours
at $150, i.e. $1,200. In all, I allow
$3,768 for Mr Baker’s costs.
Mr Jack Kucsak representing Oasis Homes has claimed thirteen days absence
from work at $200 per day. I accept and allow him the sum
of $2,600 for loss of
income. I also allow his return train fare from Geelong to Melbourne for
thirteen days at $16.80 and I allow
the same train fare for his wife for eight
days including today: - twenty one rail fares @ $16.80 = $352.80. I am
satisfied that
the attendance of Mrs Kucsak assisted Mr Marzella, which in turn
assisted the Tribunal in the conduct of the hearing.
I allow seven days Domestic Building Tribunal Hearing Fees @ $100 per day =
Counsel Fees
The account rendered on behalf of Counsel in this case exceeds the amount of
costs shown in Scale D but I do not think the daily fees
claimed or the amount
for preparation and submissions are unreasonable given the nature of the case.
I am concerned as to the amount
claimed for conferences. No details of
conferences have been given. I reduce the amount claimed for conferences by
$480 and allow
a total of $7,650 for Counsel fees.
I allow interest at the rate of 10% on the amount of $1,042.15 for 304 days
from 15 November, 1996 to today - an amount of $86.82.
The sum of $1,042.15 is
the amount I found owing on the builder’s fix-out claim after deductions
for defects, etc.
