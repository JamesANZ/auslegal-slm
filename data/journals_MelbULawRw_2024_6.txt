I Introduction
There is a persistent debate in legal scholarship regarding the construction
of directors’ duties to act in the best interests
of the corporation. At
its crux are questions of the meaning and purpose of the corporation. In
practical terms, it is predominantly
concerned with the extent to which
directors should be guided solely or primarily by the goal of maximising value
for shareholders,
or whether the interests of a broader group of stakeholders,
or concepts such as corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’)
social licence, can or should
be taken into
debate raises related questions of the appropriate level of corporate regulation
and the reach of state intervention in corporate
governance.
At times in Australian
scholarship, and more often in the United States (‘US’) and United
Kingdom (‘UK’),
the issues of directors’ duties and
CSR are situated in the broader context of the politico-economic project of
neoliberalism and the associated financialisation of the
corporation.
account, underpinned by ideas about individual economic and political
freedom, has played an important role in shaping the debate
around the purpose
and responsibilities of the corporation.
This article seeks to contribute to this ongoing debate in two ways. First,
by revisiting the neoliberal ideas underpinning the nexus of contracts
theory of the corporation. Connections can and have been made between
neoliberalism — as an ideology which valorises individual interactions
in free markets, champions deregulation, and is generally
hostile to the social
welfare state
— and contractarian theory, which views the corporation as a fiction; a
nexus or a market for individuals to meet and voluntarily
contract in their own
contractarian theory has been described as both an attempt to
re-privatise the modern corporation, and the root of shareholder primacy in
laws and structures of corporate governance.
This article explores the analytical usefulness of these theorisations in the
Australian context by considering whether shareholder
primacy is reflected in
our corporate governance regime, focusing particularly on directors’
duties to act in the best interests
of the corporation, and governance
principles and recommendations for listed entities.
The second contribution this article makes is in examining the widely
reported corporate

from the JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme — the Australian government’s

As to whether directors’

paradigm or whether CSR and community expectations are a
significant influence, JobKeeper makes for an ideal case study. This is
precisely because a significant portion of responsibility for the
scheme’s unpopular outcomes can be attributed to the legislation
which gave it effect. Indeed, the response from many corporations that opted to
retain JobKeeper payments was based simply
on their entitlement at
to the heart of the matter. To expect corporations to repay subsidies to which
lawfully — but perhaps not morally — entitled is to expect
corporations to act in a socially responsible way, above and
beyond mere
compliance with the law. Moreover, it is to expect directors to make decisions
which may be socially
responsible or in accord with community expectations, but which may be
financially detrimental to the corporation and its shareholders.
Examining a scheme which sought to save jobs by directing support through the
corporation, together with the directors’ responses
to demands to repay
JobKeeper subsidies, this article argues that the profiteering itself and the
response to the backlash are consistent
with and legitimated by theory, law and
governance principles which prioritise the interests of shareholders over other
stakeholders
and which might permit, but neither compel nor meaningfully
encourage, socially responsible corporate behaviour where there is a
financial detriment in doing so. This conclusion suggests that a voluntary
approach to CSR and the optimistically permissive interpretation of the law
on directors’ duties in our latest governmental
reviews are unlikely to
encourage more morally conscientious corporate
decision-making.
II The Neoliberal
Theorisation of the Corporation
In ‘The Neoliberal Corporation’, David Ciepley describes the
subject of his book chapter as
a novel theoretical and organizational construct that treats the pecuniary
interests of shareholders as the sole end of the corporation and gears
governance toward maximizing shareholder returns against the
opportunism of managers and
It is a beguilingly
concise summary. To consider the subject it describes in detail often involves a
trip through the history of the
corporation, from at least the medieval period
(if not before) to the present day, and attempts to theorise it across
In this Part, I will discuss a particular theorisation of the
corporation, namely as ‘
a nexus for a set of contracting relationships
individuals
which is said to be the root of shareholder primacy as the dominant paradigm of
Anglo-American corporate
governance.
This theorisation has been both shaped by neoliberal champions and has been a
key ingredient in the
establishment of financialised corporate
capitalism.
The corporation is a source of complexity and contradiction for
neoliberalism. The two are, at first glance, not easily
reconcilable.
Although a notoriously loose label, attempts to define neoliberalism regularly
bring together ideas of individual liberty, and political
and economic policy.
Neoliberalism is said to advocate
interactions in
as essential to the advancement of human
neoliberals, economic freedom is both a means and an end: an essential aspect of
individual freedom itself, but also ‘an
indispensable means toward the
achievement of political freedom’.
such, the idea of individual liberty ultimately underlies the policies and
processes with which neoliberalism is commonly associated,
privatisation, deregulation, marketisation and free
the corporation, the point of contradiction is that neoliberalism has promoted
the interests of corporations as part of its
agenda for ‘economic
liberalization’, despite corporations traditionally
being considered antithetical to

The corporation undermined the

because the corporate form was seen as a state-sponsored ‘bundle
privileges’ and a kind of collective; therefore, it was a distortion to
markets and a limitation on the maximum capacity

Indeed, the question of the corporation marks one of the points where
neoliberalism strongly
diverges from classical liberalism.
For early neoliberals, especially the members of the Mont Pèlerin
the corporation and corporate

reinvigorated in the face of (perceived)
looming totalitarianism following World
However, the solution to that
problem, as Ciepley traces in detail, continued to change over the

‘vociferous opponents of monopoly, in all its forms’, including
threat of corporate monopoly was one of the impetuses for the neoliberal
conception of the strong, interventionist state —
albeit for the limited
purpose of creating and maintaining competitive markets — as opposed to
the general rolling back or
hollowing out of the state with which neoliberalism
is often simplistically equated.
as scholars have noted, the neoliberal attitude to corporate monopolies
underwent not only a transformation, but a complete
reversal during the 1950s
Prominent neoliberals, including
Milton Friedman, not only abandoned their earlier opposition to corporate
monopolies, but came to
be their theoretical
supporters.
In short, they concluded that:
even where it existed, monopoly was not immune to the power of competition; the
effects of monopoly
were relatively sanguine and certainly preferable to
unwanted government regulation; and consumers benefited from these large and
efficient market actors thanks to downward price
Each of these conclusions concerned the empirical effects of the existence of
large and monopolistic corporations. To overcome the
in principle objections of
the classical liberals required a ‘reconceptualization of the corporation,
its form, and its governance’.
up this task, the neoliberals theorised the corporation as a nexus of private
contracting individuals.
As an idea, it
sits well with the neoliberal conception of markets as — while not
naturally occurring —

extensions or constructions of
liberal rights, and especially freedom of
This theorisation was facilitated
by the history of the corporation itself, in which the ‘grosser
delegations’ of sovereign
power and jurisdiction ended and incorporation

the state less conspicuous, as Susan Mary Watson
argues, it ‘was a change

perspective of the corporation, strongly associated with Adolf A Berle Jr and

also served as the ‘essential point of
departure’ for another closely related theory which carried the
implications of this theorisation into the realm of corporate
governance: agency
For Ciepley, this agency
relationship, inextricably linked to the work of Michael Jensen and William
Meckling, became ‘the
underlying assumption of all
subsequent neoliberal treatments of the
corporation’.
Jensen and Meckling, like Friedman, accepted that: (1) the corporation is a
legal fiction, a nexus in which the divergent or competing
interests of
individuals are ‘brought into equilibrium within a framework of
contractual relations’;
and (2) the
relationship between shareholders (as the owners of the corporation) and
directors is one of ‘pure

context of the shareholder-director

The frequently cited techniques for aligning the interests of directors with

providing greater accountability of boards to
shareholders.

But as numerous scholars have pointed out, the theoretical foundations used
to justify shareholder primacy are, at least as a matter
‘inaccurate, incorrect, and
unpersuasive’.

which directors’ duties are owed.
Legal pedantry aside, it would be difficult to overstate the theoretical and
practical influence of the neoliberal theorisations
of the corporation. The
contractarian conception shaped analyses of the corporation, while the agency
relationship between shareholders
and directors provided ‘the
intellectual framework ... [of] the question of corporate governance ...
since the 1980s’.
As Paddy Ireland
summarises:
[T]he ‘mistaken analogy’ of shareholder ownership, whether of the
company itself or of ‘the capital’, continues
to cast a long shadow
over the governance debate, serving as the main justification for the
anachronistic retention by shareholders

The role and
purpose of corporations law and corporate governance structures, according to
these theories, is ‘to maximize shareholder
wealth’ by giving effect
to shareholders’ rights and to monitor and discipline
to what extent do they fulfill that theorised purpose?
III Shareholder Primacy
and Corporations Law and Governance
Ciepley’s definition of the neoliberal corporation describes both a
theoretical and organisational construct which prioritises
the financial
interests of shareholders.
The theoretical
side of that construct, as discussed, is anchored in the contractarian
conception of the corporation which sanctifies
the proprietary interests of
shareholders and frames the central issue of corporate governance as the agency
dilemma. To understand
the organisational or applied side of that description
requires an examination of corporations law itself and corporate governance
structures which give shareholder primacy legal substance and
effect. In the US context, Ciepley argues that the most noteworthy influence
of these theorisations has been on the understanding
of directors’ duties

the shareholder primacy central to the neoliberal conception of the corporation.
Opinions diverge as to
the current state of the law, in particular the meaning
and scope of ‘the best interests of the corporation’. This is
complexified
by perceptions among some commentators that the law on this issue is in a
process of change.
In a genealogical analysis of case law on directors’ duties to act in
the best interests of the corporation, Jean J du Plessis
concludes that in the
past, courts and commentators were influenced by ‘deeply embedded’
yet untenable perceptions.
The perceptions
he refers to are those associated with neoliberal corporate theory: perceptions
of shareholders as owners (of the
corporation or capital), of an agential
relationship between shareholders and directors, and of shareholders as

Where does this leave the duty of directors to act in the corporation’s
best interests in Australian law and what is the influence

noting that, ‘as a general proposition, acting in the best interests of
the company generally means acting in the [best] interests
of shareholders as a
general body’
and that the company
is seen as ‘embodied by ... current and future
shareholders’.
This conclusion is
strengthened given that the only situation where Australian courts have
‘clearly identified’ that
the interests of stakeholders may be
considered without there being a derivative benefit to shareholders (or where
stakeholders’
interests may be prioritised over shareholders’
interests) is when a company is insolvent or approaching
insolvency.
That exception aside, it is
said that ‘there is no authoritative pronouncement at the appellate
level’ on the question
of whether directors may or must take
non-shareholder interests into account.
As such, notwithstanding the perceived trajectory towards an increasing
stakeholderism in academic commentary and even judicial decisions
acknowledging
that a variety of interests might be represented in the corporate entity, except
in the case of
insolvency, it can still be argued that Australian law is yet to meaningfully
recognise stakeholders’ interests or CSR considerations
in the context of
directors’ duties to the company.
The pervasiveness of the shareholder-centric interpretation is demonstrated
in the descriptions of the law adopted in our most recent
significant reviews
into the question of corporate responsibility. For instance, after examining the
general law and
Corporations Act
, the Corporations and Markets Advisory
Committee (‘CAMAC’) in its 2006 report concluded that
directors have considerable discretion concerning the interests they may take
into account in corporate decision-making, provided
their purpose is to act in

of shareholders as a
CAMAC’s description of the law on directors’ duties represents an
enlightened shareholder value perspective: directors
may have regard to other
interests, but only insofar as they serve the financial wellbeing of
shareholders. Similarly, in its 2014
discussion paper, the Governance Institute
of Australia said that ‘[a]s it stands, the law generally links the
corporate interests
to those of the

The Australian Institute of Company

desire to forestall the

focus on CSR — and yet affirm different interpretations (ie, entity

Shareholder Primacy
and Good Corporate Governance
When the first edition of what is now called the ASX Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations

relied upon by some as evidence that shareholder primacy was not ingrained in
corporate governance and in support of arguments
against amending the law on
directors’ duties to clarify the extent to which stakeholders’
interests could or should
be taken into account. For example, principle 10,
which required that companies should ‘[r]ecognise the legitimate interests
of stakeholders’,
was used to
support the conclusion that it was ‘quite clear that contemporary
corporate governance, as well as the law generally,
demands that directors recognise and protect stakeholder
interests’.
While it was perhaps a
stretch to say corporate governance (let alone law) demands
that stakeholders’ interests be protected by reference to a general
principle contained within a set of ‘guidelines’ (‘not
prescriptions’),
principle 10 did
on its face challenge shareholder primacy. It recognised the ‘legal and
other obligations’ of companies
to non-shareholder stakeholders including
employees, customers and the broader

edition, principle 10 was

peripherally.
For instance, in the
current edition, principle 3 recommends that companies ‘[i]nstil a culture

the commentary alludes to the
value of the corporation’s reputation and, relatedly, its standing with
stakeholders. However,
as with the generally shareholder-centric
understanding of Australian law on directors’ duties (and similarly to
s 172 of the
Companies Act
), the commentary also makes it clear that
shareholders’ interests remain the paramount consideration. This approach
to consider that stakeholders’ interests are only a means to the
end of creating value for shareholders, not an end in itself.
A comparison between the original and current edition of the ASX
Corporate Governance Council’s
Corporate Governance Principles and
Recommendations
reveal both a move away from originally strong(er)
stakeholder-oriented positions and opposition to concepts such as broader social
accountability.
For example, the first
edition recommended a code of conduct to guide compliance with legal and other
obligations to stakeholders
in order to facilitate corporate ‘[p]ublic or
social accountability ... based on notions of
legitimacy, fairness and
Not only were such
notions of public accountability left out of later editions, but attempts at
introducing similar concepts, like
the social licence to operate, were met with
The idea of the
social licence to operate was included as part of the commentary to principle

uncertainty of its
meaning but also (puzzlingly) the perception that its impact
and reach would ‘vary over
The social licence to
operate was also
opposed because — reaffirming the general perception of the law
described above — its inherent ‘notion of broader
stakeholder
accountability ... might actually conflict with the duties of directors, as they
have been espoused by the courts and
are traditionally understood in
Australia’.
Of course, the stated purpose of the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s
Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations
is, after all, to
recommend governance practices which should meet the ‘reasonable
expectations of most investors’.
The protection of investors’ interests rightly undergirds a number of
prudent principles and recommendations, including safeguarding
integrity in
financial reporting, making timely and balanced disclosure, and
‘respect[ing] the rights of
shareholders’.
But while these
have been a steady feature across each edition, other principles concerned with
broader stakeholder accountability,
as noted, either fell away or were opposed.
The principle of respecting the rights of investors includes a recommendation
that companies
adopt an ‘investor relations program’ to facilitate
two-way communication with investors.
The commentary includes the somewhat tepid suggestion that such a program
‘may also run in tandem with a wider stakeholder
but without the weight
of an actual recommendation, demonstrating the greater significance attached to
the interests of shareholders
vis-a-vis other stakeholders. The agential
relationship between directors and shareholders, and the concern with agency
the bonding of potentially unaligned interests, is reinforced in the
principle to remunerate fairly and responsibly,
especially in more recent editions which expressly advise companies to design
remuneration policies ‘to align [senior executives’]
... interests
with the creation of value for security
The relationship between shareholders and stakeholders, and particularly the
broader public as a stakeholder, is demonstrated in another
mainstay principle
of good governance, namely to recognise and manage
The accompanying recommendation
advises companies to disclose any exposure to (and, if exposed, plans to manage)
, including ‘environmental risk’ and ‘social’
or ‘social sustainability
The third edition
acknowledges that how a company conducts its activities may impact a range of
stakeholders, adding that whether
a company operates sustainably ‘can
impact in the longer term on
society and the environment’.
However, the next paragraph emphasises the increasing demand from investors for
transparency around such issues ‘so that they
can properly assess
investment risk’.
Reasserting the
centrality of the shareholder, the commentary to the same recommendation in the
edition omits the references to stakeholders and attaches importance to these
risks only insofar as they affect a company’s
‘ability to create
long-term value for security
The change in definition
is also interesting. The third edition refers to
‘social sustainability’
defining the term using the
language of the social licence; namely, a company’s ability ‘to
operating in a manner that meets accepted social norms and needs over the
long term’.
By contrast, the
current edition uses ‘social risks’, but leaves out the language
implying broad social accountability.
Neither edition defines social risks by reference to the harm caused or the
impact on affected groups (as one might have expected),
but the fourth edition
gives prominent place to the risk of unwanted regulatory interference —
reminiscent of the neoliberals’
justification for their reconciliation
with corporate monopoly.

clearly enshrining shareholder primacy, by making social or environmental
stakeholder considerations relevant only insofar
as they serve or impact upon
shareholder value, these principles also capture the de-regulatory or
anti-regulatory predilections
and advocacy of maximum
business autonomy associated with neoliberalism.

the targeted beneficiaries of JobKeeper were businesses struggling to keep

in the scheme were also clearly recognised. They were also unequivocally public
in nature. JobKeeper
was the government acting decisively in the ‘national
interest’, in
response to a ‘national
emergency’.
The Prime Minister, on

was passed, reminded us that ‘[p]rotecting our

‘[s]o today we will agree to pay
that price through the important measures we will
legislate.’
The support itself
might have been intended for workers in significantly impacted businesses, but
the stakeholders in the scheme
could be said to include the nation itself or the
Australian public, taxpayers, and the government — not least
because each could be said to bear the historic cost of the scheme and the
potentially long-lasting impact of that cost.

As has already been noted, a significant portion of the blame for the
deficiencies of JobKeeper can be attributed to the scheme’s design (and
government as its designer); particularly, the use of projected (rather than
actual) declines in turnover, the length of support under the original model
and the absence of any public record of recipients or
a mechanism to clawback
subsidies if required. When faced with criticism for the profiteering and
perceived waste, the Prime Minister
and Treasurer respectively stressed that
JobKeeper was ‘more than just a wage
and reminded critics that the scheme was designed and implemented during a
crisis — when the nation was ‘staring into
These are legitimate points. The generous six-month period of

‘economic bounce back’.
said, governments in various other jurisdictions which implemented broadly
similar programs proved capable of turning their
minds to those issues in
relation to which our scheme was criticised. For example, the New Zealand
government developed a substantially
similar scheme, but with a shorter initial
period of support and a two-tier payment system (for full-time and part-time

(ie workers on unpaid
Both New Zealand and the UK
included searchable public records of employers that received
facilitating greater
transparency and public scrutiny. In Europe, various countries prohibited
corporations that received support
from paying dividends or bonuses, or
conducting share buy-backs.
The attempt
to deflect criticism of JobKeeper because of the uncertain environment in which
it was developed is also undermined in
that there were at least some
commentators who warned, before the scheme became law, that it had the capacity
to become ‘corporate
welfare’ and ‘indistinguishable from a
straight-out subsidy to
businesses’.
That said, it is
precisely because the scheme was imperfect and liable to be exploited that it is
relevant to the debate on directors’
duties and CSR more broadly —
which looks to the question of corporations’ responsibilities
mere compliance with the law. It is pertinent to note that when
asked what action the government would take in response to JobKeeper
profiteering, the Prime Minister (while congratulating those that repaid)
defended the profiteers on the basis of their legal entitlement,
saying simply
‘the law is the law’.
following analysis, which shows that various directors and CEOs seemed to be
guided by the same logic in reckoning whether to
keep or repay JobKeeper
subsidies, reveals something of the limits to CSR as a prophylactic against
legally permissible but perhaps
socially irresponsible behaviour, especially
where the ethical choice carries a clear financial detriment.
Repaying JobKeeper
and the Best Interests of the Corporation
Information such as the amount of JobKeeper repaid, relative to profits and
distributions to investors, permits blunt or generalised
conclusions about the
extent to which the financial interests of the theorised ‘owners’
of the corporation were prioritised by directors. Greater
insights, however, can
be gleaned by:
attempting to understand the reasons
corporations opted to either
retain or repay JobKeeper; discerning whose interests were contemplated and
ultimately served in that decision; and assessing whether those decisions
align with the theories, laws and corporate governance structures
Of the sample in Table 1, those which stand out are the companies which
posted significant NPAT, declared dividends, and still chose
to retain all the
JobKeeper support they received. For example, Eagers Automotive Ltd
(‘Eagers’) opted to repay nothing of the $131 million in
JobKeeper it received, despite posting profits in excess of $465
million and
declaring dividends worth more than $166
Eagers was one of the companies
specifically
targeted in the media, with reports noting its billionaire investor, Nick
Politis, would personally receive a dividend worth $17
Defending the
decision to keep JobKeeper, Eagers’ CEO said the support ‘was
used exactly as it was intended to be by the
government’.
Similar comments going to simple legal eligibility for JobKeeper and it being
applied as intended were made by the chairs and CEOs
of Southern Cross Media
Group Ltd (‘Southern Cross
Media’) and Accent Group Ltd (‘Accent’); the latter of
which said, vaguely,
JobKeeper had been ‘fully deployed’ — presumably meaning it
had been fully offset against the company’s wage
Such justifications highlight the question of corporate responsibility
legal obligations and the role, if any, of directors’ duties
and corporate governance principles in encouraging or compelling
conscientious corporate behaviour. Insofar as the scheme was intended to
subsidise wages, it was (as far as can be seen) used
as intended and in
accordance with the enabling legislation and rules. But that proposition becomes
more tenuous if we look beyond
legal entitlement and recall that the scheme was
also intended as an ‘economic lifeline’ and ‘rescue
for businesses which suffered ‘a significant financial
hit’ from the pandemic — and that a broad group of stakeholders
interests in the scheme.
The Business Council of Australia (‘BCA’) clearly had such
considerations in mind when it said that companies simply ‘should
not’ pay executive bonuses if they received JobKeeper, because the scheme
‘wasn’t designed for that, it was designed
to keep people
Interestingly, the BCA — whose mission statement describes the role of
business as delivering for shareholders while
being ‘good corporate citizens’ and balancing a range of
stakeholder
— felt more
conflicted on the question of dividends. The BCA
advised companies to ‘exercise some very careful judgement’,
without explaining why dividends were any more reconcilable
than bonuses in the
context of a scheme which, as acknowledged, was fundamentally about keeping
workers employed.
Alluding, in general,
to directors’ legal obligations to act in the interests of the company,
Eagers also noted that while
it was a ‘grateful’ recipient of
JobKeeper, it also ‘had to consider all of its stakeholders, including
shareholders
when making
decisions’.
It is plain enough to
see how Eagers’ shareholders benefited from the board’s decision
with respect to JobKeeper, but
who the company’s (non-shareholder)
stakeholders were or the extent to which their interests were genuinely
considered is unclear.
If those stakeholders included, say, the public,
taxpayers or the government, one might at least conclude that their interests
seeing JobKeeper repaid) were subordinated to the interests of shareholders.
Whether Eagers in fact only had regard to shareholders’
interests, or
considered stakeholders’ interests before subordinating them to those of
investors, either outcome is consistent
with a theorisation of the
corporation and a framework of corporate law and governance which makes
shareholders’ interests paramount and which neither
compels, nor
meaningfully encourages, genuine consideration of broader stakeholders in
corporate decision-making.
Turning to consider the reasoning of directors who did determine to repay
JobKeeper also
reveals, counterintuitively, a shareholder primacy that
accords with that same hierarchy of interests. After initially resisting calls
repayments,
some of the companies
that received the most media attention, such as retail business operators Harvey
Norman Holdings Ltd (‘Harvey
Norman’) and Premier Investments Ltd
(‘Premier’), eventually made full or partial
repayments.
Premier repaid just $15.6
million, out of almost $87 million
received, despite posting an NPAT of $137.8 million for FY2019–20 (an
increase of 29% on the pre-pandemic FY2018–19) and $271.8 million for
FY2020–21 (an increase of 97.3% on its FY2019–20
In a release to the ASX,
Premier said it was repaying the ‘net benefit’ received under the
first stage of JobKeeper (without
elaborating
The decision was made
after having earlier resisted calls to repay anything, with its CEO citing
the risk of future lockdowns and asking ‘who’
would pay staff that
might be unable to work in the future.
The question was rhetorical, but given the FY2019–20 results published
just a few months earlier, the answer might have been:
the company. Indeed, in
announcing its decision to make the repayment, Premier’s board said that
it was precisely because its
increased trading had ‘fully offset the cost
of supporting our teams through ... lockdowns’, together with the
increasingly
stable environment, that it determined ‘it [was] now
appropriate to refund the net JobKeeper benefit’ — as if
internalising
the cost of supporting ‘our teams’ without that cost
being fully offset by increased profitability would otherwise have
inappropriate.
Apart from being
indicative of the weight attributed to the interests of employee stakeholders
vis-a-vis investors, it
implies that the decision to repay was only appropriate if shareholders were
not (net) worse off — which suggests that the government’s
end, sustained shareholder returns as much as it supported the continued
employment of workers.
A further example comes from logistics and infrastructure company, Qube
Holdings Ltd (‘Qube’), which repaid a little over
half of the almost
$30.5 million it received in JobKeeper, after making NPAT of over $371 million
and declaring dividends of more
The board stated plainly that
had JobKeeper not been available, then management would have implemented
‘cost-saving initiatives
... to mitigate the impact on ... [Qube’s]
financial performance’; adding that the decision to repay the JobKeeper
received in FY2020–21 was taken only ‘when it was clear
that Qube’s financial performance would enable it to maintain
the majority
of its workforce ... and absorb the additional operating costs without ...
Government financial
While Qube’s reasoning suggests the interests of its employees were a
relevant consideration, it also highlights the overriding
importance of the
company’s financial performance and, moreover, its importance to
shareholders. Indeed, Qube’s discussion
of its decision to repay JobKeeper
is the contextual prelude to its explanation to investors regarding which
measures of financial
performance are the most appropriate. Qube provided no
explanation for its decision to retain all of the JobKeeper received in
despite posting a larger NPAT in FY2019–20 than in
But the clearest
demonstration that the decision to repay anything was related solely to the
financial performance of the company
in the interests of shareholders —
and, indeed, executive management through the agential relationship and related
strategies — is revealed in its report to investors on
remuneration and short-term incentive
While the company claimed it
did not ‘benefit materially’ from the JobKeeper
were that not the case then the
decision to repay might be seen as an example of the divergent interests of
management and investors
as the central concern of agency theory: that is,
management returning (legally obtained) funds out of some misplaced sense of
responsibility, or duty to stakeholders, and against the interests of
shareholders. The decision to repay might have been said to
best interests of the company. Qube, however, after noting that the repayment
was included as an ‘expense’ when
calculating the achievement of
financial key performance indicators for the managing director and key
management personnel, went
on to assure investors that ‘had management
understood JobKeeper would ultimately be voluntarily
repaid, they would have planned further cost reductions thus increasing the
financial outcomes relative to
What this evidences is
an ethos — backed by theory, law and principles of good corporate
governance — of maintaining
returns on equity at certain rates expected by
shareholders over and above the interests of other stakeholders. That is,
shareholder
returns must be sustained first and foremost and, where there is
anything likely to impact those returns, cost measures should be
undertaken to
prevent that outcome.
As noted, the director’s duty to act in the best interests of the
company has been judicially interpreted (and is broadly perceived)
according to
an enlightened shareholder value perspective, where stakeholder interests might
be considered, but only derivatively
to the interests of
shareholders.
This conception is
arguably reflected in cases where the decision to repay JobKeeper was a
capitulation after sustained scrutiny,
as was the case for Harvey Norman and
Premier among others. The decisions were reported as the companies bowing to
public pressure,
rather than choices made in the interests of any broader
stakeholder group.
That is not to say
the decision could not still be said to be in the interests of the corporation
itself, for instance in protecting
the corporate reputation (a legitimate
motivation, as acknowledged by several of the judgments
discussed).
However, the reactive
response tends to diminish any suggestion that broader stakeholder interests
were ‘represented in the
interests of the company’ or drove
directors’ decisions. It colours the decision as a response to social risk
as envisaged
by the current edition of the ASX Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Principles and
Recommendations
That is, a decision
taken to avoid lasting reputational damage to shareholders’ long-term
financial interests, which remain
It does not appear to be a
decision taken by reference to the expectations of the stakeholder group itself
(eg customers, the community,
taxpayers) whose opinions might ultimately
determine that reputational risk, or in consideration of the harms (or benefits)
stakeholders might experience depending on the action taken.
It must be said that there were instances in which companies’ decisions
to repay JobKeeper and their reasoning for doing so
appeared to challenge that
shareholder primacy which distinguishes neoliberal corporate legality. For a
small number of companies
which opted to repay, a range of stakeholder
interests and a sense of social responsibility seemed to be relevant factors.
Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd (‘Toyota’)
was one of the
earliest to announce its decision to repay the entirety of its $18.2 million in
Toyota cited its policy of ‘contributing to the local economy’ and a
desire to ‘minimise the cost imposition [on]
taxpayer[s]’, adding that it ‘wanted to do the right thing as well
as avoid any unnecessary reputational
Similarly, Domino’s
Pizza Enterprises Ltd (‘Domino’s’), in repaying the entire
$1.7 million it received,
said that its board had considered the intention
behind JobKeeper and ‘community expectations’ regarding the
use of public
It also claimed to be
guided by ‘straightforward principles’
including ‘to put people first (both customers and team members)’
and ‘to avoid relying on unnecessary government
assistance’.
Taking these
companies at their word, their decisions seem consistent with the perceived
trajectory of law on directors’ duties
towards a broader stakeholder
interest orientation and some weight appears to have been given to the interests
of taxpayers, the
government, and the expectations of the wider community.
However, the subsidies received and repaid by these companies were also
relative to NPAT and when compared with the major recipients in Table 1. For
example, the JobKeeper subsidies received and
repaid by Domino’s represent
approximately 0.5% of its NPAT of $322.5 million for the combined
FY2019–20 and
By comparison, for Eagers,
Cross Media
the amount received in
JobKeeper represented, respectively, 27%, 65% and 34% of reported NPAT. It is
also worth noting that for Domino’s,
the NPAT for FY2019–20 ($138.5
million) was 119% of (or $22.9 million more than) its result in FY2018–19
Compared with the largest beneficiaries of JobKeeper, Domino’s and Toyota
were the exception in terms
of their ostensibly stakeholder-oriented position, but also in the
insignificance of the support received (and repaid) relative to
performance. The
reasoning from directors who kept and repaid JobKeeper tends to suggest both
the dominance of the shareholder primacy norm and the
limited effectiveness of
concepts such as CSR or the social licence, at least when confronted with
decisions which may be socially
responsible or in line with community
expectations, but financially detrimental to the corporation and its
shareholders.
V Conclusion
This article has sought to contribute to an ongoing discussion regarding the
construction of directors’ duties to the corporation
and the extent to
which its interests can be equated with the financial interests of shareholders,
or whether corporate decision-making
can or should be influenced by broader
stakeholders and CSR. Revisiting the theorisation of the corporation as a nexus
of contracts
and its implications for corporate governance and regulation, I
argued that — while acknowledging the differences of opinion and the
sense of ongoing change — it can reasonably be said
that Australian
corporations law and governance principles currently continue to reflect the
shareholder primacy norm paradigmatic
of the neoliberal
corporation.
An analysis of the
profiteering from JobKeeper and directors’ justifications for keeping or
repaying subsidies reveals, in
general, an understanding of the corporation and
its interests consistent with a conception of the corporation which centralises
shareholder value and which is validated by law and related structures which
make the financial interests of shareholders the paramount
consideration.
This is not to suggest that shareholder primacy and its reflection in
directors’ duties or governance principles is the sole
reason for or
explains of itself why so much JobKeeper ended up as corporate welfare. A
variety of factors might have contributed
to decisions to keep or repay
JobKeeper, including various board-level characteristics which have been
previously examined in terms
of their influence on CSR
Further, it must be
acknowledged that
surveys of company directors suggest that
has only a limited
influence on the actual decision-making of
Despite this, we can
conclude that the law and corporate governance structures discussed did not
prevent or challenge the outcomes for which JobKeeper
(and its beneficiaries)
were criticised. Rather, they facilitated and legitimated those outcomes. This
conclusion invites us to (re)consider
the relationship of corporate law and
governance to CSR and community expectations of corporate behaviour —
though a detailed
examination is beyond the scope of this article.
A commonly discussed option is to amend
Corporations Act
to permit or compel directors to have regard to the interests of non-shareholder
stakeholders when determining what is in the best
interests of the
Section 172 of the
provides an example. However, the UK model is arguably not better
than current Australian law. Despite recognition that a variety
of interests
might be represented in the company,
a general proposition, directors in Australia may only take into account
stakeholder
interests ‘provided their purpose is to act in the interests of the
company as a whole, interpreted as the financial well-being
of shareholders as a
general body’.
This existing
enlightened shareholder value interpretation legitimates the decisions of
companies which claimed to have at least
considered stakeholder interests,
before proceeding in a way which clearly prioritised the financial interests of
shareholders. In
any event, as noted, the UK position arguably does nothing more
than statutorily enshrine shareholder
and there are increasing calls
for further reform to s 172 of the
Companies Act
remove the concept of shareholder primacy and broaden the scope of the
purpose of the company to include operating in such a way as
to reduce harm
to — and indeed deliver benefits for — wider society and the
environment.
Another option, proposed recently in the context of climate change, is to
Corporations Act
to expressly allow directors to have regard to
stakeholder and non-financial interests and even grant ‘special
standing’ to stakeholder groups to provide an enforcement
through which companies can be held
accountable.
As for alternatives without
the need for legislative reform, Rosemary Teele Langford has recently written
governance’ as a potential model for refocusing
corporate governance to ‘help solve the conundrum’ of
duties and the extent to which stakeholders’ interests
may be considered and promoted.
Stakeholder interests could of course also be re-recognised and strengthened in
recommendations for good governance, such as the
ASX Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations
; reversing the
trend of whittling down and delegitimising such interests. More radical reform
proposals include a reduction in the
control rights of shareholders under
corporations legislation and devolving rights to a new ‘stakeholder
board’, in which
the interests of employees, the community or other groups
might be represented.
The need to
decouple executive performance and remuneration systems from shareholders’
financial interests has also been
recognised.
As to theoretical understandings of the corporation, du Plessis has suggested
that an anatomy of corporate law ‘based on modern
corporate law
theory’ re-emphasises the status of the corporation as a separate legal
entity and, as such, its capacity to
represent the interests of a variety of
stakeholders.
Similarly, Watson has
proposed an ‘entity-based’ understanding of the modern
reminiscent of Berle Jr and
Means’ conception of corporations as ‘real’ and
‘public’ entities,
emphasising the centrality of the capital
Once the company is understood
this way, Watson argues, decisions of boards favouring non-shareholder
constituents of the corporate
firm become legitimate and necessary ‘so
long as the objective is to sustain and grow the
capital fund’.
However, by
subordinating those constituent interests to the growth of the capital fund, it
is arguable that such an approach extends
but is still partially aligned with
existing enlightened shareholder value positions, at least in the sense that the
consideration
of stakeholder interests are valid only insofar as they are
derivative of or instrumentally serve some other purpose. This criticism
perhaps ameliorated to an extent where entity primacy
approaches emphasise not only that stakeholders’ interests might be
reflected in the interests of the corporate entity, but
that the object of
sustaining and growing the
of the capital fund itself should be
understood broadly: going beyond financial value to include social and
environmental value and
corporate citizenship also.
Clearly the simplest way to avoid JobKeeper
profiteering would have been to design the scheme to prevent that outcome in the
place or with a mechanism dealing with that
eventuality.
Corporations applied for
and (mostly) retained JobKeeper subsidies on the basis they were legally
entitled to do so. The profiteering
occurred where corporations were (to borrow
from Friedman) playing according to the ‘rules of the society ... embodied
— and arguably ‘custom’ too, though perhaps not
‘rules’ embodied in law were important at two levels. First, the
scheme’s design enabled profitable companies
to legally claim billions,
even if such was not the intention of the scheme and was at odds with community
expectations. Second,
(hard) law on directors’ duties and (soft) corporate
governance principles, undergirded by
neoliberal theory, which make the interests of shareholders paramount,
facilitated and legitimated the decision to keep lawfully obtained
(if unneeded
and undeserved) subsidies, without regard for community expectations of CSR.
JobKeeper thus highlights the importance
of appropriately designing,
structuring, and implementing ‘the rules’ precisely because
loopholes and opportunities will
potentially be ‘exploited’ and
‘abused’ by corporations. But it also forces us to recognise that
permit directors to consider various stakeholder
interests and concepts like CSR and the social
our current regime is only
partially effective. The work of actually getting corporations to act
conscientiously,
minimum legal requirements, continues.

shareholders (even where

is precarious, the creditors

Under both the
Corporations Act
and the common law, directors have a
duty to act in the best interests of the corporation. In this regard, they are
required to consider
the interests of shareholders and, in some limited
circumstances, creditors. This position reflects the long-standing view of the
corporate officer as an agent of shareholders.
