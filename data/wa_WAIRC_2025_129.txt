Reasons for Decision
THE COMMISSION IN COURT SESSION
31 January 2025, amendments to the minimum rate of pay for casual employees in
s 11 of the
Minimum Conditions of Employment Act 1993
came into effect:
Industrial Relations
Legislation Amendment Act 2024
That amendment increased the
minimum casual rate of pay from 20% to 25% of the statutory minimum rate of pay
set under section 12
of the MCE Act
s 50A(1)(a)(i)
Industrial Relations Act 1979
awards made under the IR Act contain a casual loading rate of 20% or are silent
in relation to casual rates of pay. This means
that there are some awards
containing casual rates of pay that are now below the amount employees are
entitled to be paid under s
11 of the MCE Act.
identified this anomaly, UnionsWA applied to the Western Australian Industrial
for a General Order under s 50 of the IR Act to
ensure that all awards provide for a casual loading of at least 25% of the
rate for the relevant classification in the award.
of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, the
for Industrial Relations, and the Western Australian Local
Government Association (
) took part in these proceedings.
application was not opposed.
parties agreed that the application be determined on the papers.
determining the application, the Commission in Court Session has had regard to
the grounds set out in UnionsWA’s application,
the submissions contained
in the responses filed by the Chamber, the Minister and WALGA; UnionsWA’s
further written submissions
and WALGA’s further written submissions.
only contentious issue between the parties concerned the date any General Order
is to take effect.
the reasons that follow, we are satisfied that a General Order should issue in
the terms proposed by UnionsWA to take effect from
26 April 2025.
rates of pay are commonly calculated by reference to a percentage loading
applied to the ordinary rates of pay that would otherwise
be paid to a
‘permanent’ employee. The casual loading is to take into account
paid entitlements that casual employees
do not receive but which
‘permanent’ employees do. Precisely which entitlements are foregone
may vary across industries
and occupations but generally include different types
of leave and the entitlement to advance notice of the employment ending.
the MCE Act was first enacted, s 12 provided that a casual employee was
entitled to be paid 15% more than the statutory minimum
weekly rate of pay. The
casual loading rate was increased to 20% in 2002:
Labour Relations Reform Act
At that time, it was still common for both Federal
and State awards to specify a casual loading rate of 20%.
the decades since, 25% has become a more common casual loading rate. For the
vast majority of employees who fall under the Federal
industrial relations
system, the loading rate specified in all modern awards and the National
Employment Standards is 25%.
historical reasons for the increase to casual loading rates can probably be
traced to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission
Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering,
Printing and Kindred Industries Union; Re Metal, Engineering and Associated
Industries Award
(2000) AIRC 722
Metal, Engineering and
Associated Industries Award decision
). In that case, the casual loading rate
Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award 1988
increased to 25% with the Full Bench’s reasons being stated at paragraphs
[196] - [200] (footnotes omitted):
the reasons we have given in the preceding Sections, we are satisfied that paid
leave; long service leave; and a component covering
differential entitlement to
notice of termination of employment and employment by the hour effects, should
constitute the main components
to be assessed in determining casual loading for
the table below, we have attempted a comparison of the relative annual costs to
the employer. It is expressed as working days paid
for. It covers three main
included in the calculation
also a progressive ratio of what we estimate to be
the relative advantage of a full-time worker in days paid for over a casual
Working Days Paid
Total working days:
Less days not worked: public holidays:
Less days sick/personal: leave average used
Vested entitlements payable on completion of 260 days
Leave loading:
Vested contingent benefits
Accrued personal leave:
Long service leave
Notice of termination and employment by the hour effects:
Contingent benefit applicable to employment terminated on last day of
(1 week notice or payment in lieu)
Short time worked or paid hours differential determent:
Norm for casual working hours in industry = 36.1 hours per week i.e. 95% of
38 hour standard (d)
form of calculation is but one of a number which might be used to demonstrate
points and costing effects or estimates. For the
reasons we have given, we are
not persuaded that an exact or precise quantification of different components
should be welded on to
the determination of the casual rate loading. We are
satisfied that the existing loading is substantially exhausted in compensating
for the potential liability for paid leave entitlements applicable to other
relevant types of employment. The changed access to some
forms of personal leave
since the last adjustment in 1974, and the substantially differential access to
notice of termination for
weekly (now full-time) employees in conjunction with
the reintroduction of an employment by the hour effect for casual employees,
justify some additional loading. Our view in that respect is reinforced by what
we have broadly categorised as the notice of termination
and employment by the
hour effects. Even a minimal quantification of an addition to the loading for
that component would be sufficient
to make out a relatively compelling case for
an increase to the existing level of the loading.
regard to all relevant circumstances applying to the loadings for casual
employees under the Award, we are satisfied that a
special case has been
sufficiently made out for an adjustment of the casual rate loading to 25%. An
adjustment to that level is not
inconsistent with relevant comparable awards
having regard to the circumstances of the metals and manufacturing industry and
wide and diverse use of casual employment in it.
are not persuaded that we should refrain from granting an increase to the
loading because of any potential to thereby increase
recourse to other types of
employment including specific term employment. Such movements are to be expected
from time to time. We
have sought in our detailed reasoning in this case to
develop a rationale about casual employment and its particular incidents that
may be capable of application, with such changes as are necessary to other types
of employment. In setting each condition, we have
given weight to the
desirability of not producing different standards or reflecting preference for
one type of employment over another.
Our reasoning is founded upon the view that
provision for a type of employment should open the way to its use. If a
differential
incident is justified, it may need to be provided. Unless it is,
the broad principle we have sought to apply is to attempt to translate
standard conditions of the Award to achieve a fair and reasonable balance
between the main types of employment.
Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award
a 25% loading was adopted by the Commission in the

(2006) 86 WAIG 2537.
Commission in Court Session considered 25% fairly compensated for the value of
annual leave, leave loading, sick leave, public
holidays and termination
Full Benches also followed suit in relation to the pastoral industry and in a
number of other Federal awards: see
from Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations
[2008] AIRCFB 1000;
(2008) 177 IR 364
at [49]. The AIRC Full Bench
observed that at that time there remained great variation in casual loadings
across Notional Agreements
Preserving State Awards and Federal awards citing
examples of a 25% loading being common in the manufacturing industry, 15% - 25%
in the retail industry, 25% being common but not universal in the hospitality
industry and 33.3% and greater loadings being contained
in a number of
pre-reform awards. The Full Bench considered it desirable to standardise casual
loading to 25%.
the Fair Work Commission’s last annual wage review, the Full Bench left
the casual loading rate for award and agreement free
employees at 25%:
Re Annual Wage Review 2023-24

note that on 16 August 2024, the Queensland Industrial Relations
Commission Full Bench issued a General Ruling increasing casual
loading rates
from 23% to 25%:
Queensland Council of Unions
v State of Queensland (Office of Industrial Relations)
[2024] QIRC
Parties’ Submissions
told the Commission in Court Session that it had identified 83 private and local
government sector awards that provide for
casual employment and contain rates of
pay that, when combined with the casual loading specified in that award, is
below the amount
which the employee is entitled to be paid under s 11 of
the MCE Act.
described the result of this anomaly as:
awards contained conditions of employment that are less favourable than those
provided by the MCE Act;
practice, in some industries subject to single awards, there will be multiple
casual loading percentages that apply in order to
meet the minimum. That is,
some casual rates will be calculated under s 11 of the MCE Act and others will
be calculated by applying
the relevant award;
some awards this will cause a flattening for casual employees where despite the
award containing different rates for different
classifications, some or all
classifications will in effect have the same rate of pay for casual employees.
had further identified two private sector awards which provide for casual
employment but do not include a casual loading
term. The result in these cases
is that casual workers under those awards are only entitled to the minimum
casual rate under the
MCE Act and so may not be fairly compensated. We note
that this is not an effect created by the increase in the casual loading rate
under the MCE Act, but is a pre-existing anomaly.
says that it is in the interests of fairness and efficiency for a General Order
to issue applying to all 119 private and
local government sector awards that
either provide for a casual loading lower than 25% or provide for casual
employment that did
not include a casual loading term. Only addressing the rates
of pay that will be below the entitlement under the MCE Act
would have an
inequitable impact and create compliance challenges for employers. It would also
create the loss of existing relativities
between casual wages across the awards.
provided examples of how the anomaly operates by reference to particular awards.
These examples demonstrate that in some
instances, casual employees across
different classifications would be entitled to the same rate of pay, in other
instances, casual
employee loading rates might start at 25% and drop to 20% as
they progress through classifications. These impacts are, simply,
inequitable.
points out that because Western Australia is the only jurisdiction not to have
referred legislative powers for industrial
relations to the Commonwealth, casual
private sector employees in Western Australia are the only casual employees in
the nation not
to receive a 25% casual loading.
submits that its application supports the objects of the IR Act, in
particular:
facilitate the efficient organisation and performance of work according to the
needs of an industry and enterprises within it,
balanced with fairness to the
employees in the industry and enterprises: s 6(a)(f); and
provide a system of fair wages and conditions of employment:
submits that its application is consistent with the requirements of s 26(1)
of the IR Act including the requirement for the
Commission to have regard
to the interests of persons affected by Commission decisions, the community as a
whole and the economy.
noted that proceedings are currently on foot in the Commission in which it has
consented to the
Municipal Employees (Western Australia) Award 2021
Local Government Officers (Western Australia) Award 2021
being varied
to increase the casual loading from 20% to 25%. It noted that the effect of the
proposed General Order would be to extend
the same conditions to other awards
that apply in local government. It advised that the awards within the scope of
the proposed General
Order which may cover local governments and their employees

(Day Care Centres) Award, 1984.
Chamber submitted that State awards need reform following changes to the MCE Act
effected by the
Industrial Relations Amendment Act 2024
submitted that it is now more difficult for employers, particularly the smallest
employers, to comply with entitlements as
the anomaly creates two potential
casual loading rates for employers to navigate. This is contrary to the objects
of the IR Act in
s 6(a)(f) and should be rectified.
Chamber submitted that while employers will bear additional operating costs as a
result of any General Order issuing, in the absence
of a General Order employers
will incur administrative costs associated with the current arrangement, whereby
employers have to navigate
different casual loading rates between the awards and
the MCE Act.
Minister’s submissions endorsed UnionsWA’s and the Chamber’s
submissions. In particular, the Minister noted
that casual rates of pay in
awards that fall below the State minimum casual rate will be overridden from
31 January 2025 having the
effect that some award casual rates of pay
for different classifications for employees will be the same or very similar. In
term this will eliminate or reduce relativities between different
casual rates, undermining the skill-based classification systems
applying in
those awards.
Minister’s submissions pointed out that two casual loading rates of pay
means additional administration costs to employers.
Minister also noted the increased chance of employees being inadvertently
underpaid because State awards will not have been updated
to reflect the new
State minimum wage for casual employees. The Minister submits that establishing
a 25% casual loading as the minimum
standard for private sector State awards
would help to ensure greater consistency between the casual loadings in those
the prescribed percentage for casual rates of pay and the MCE Act and
therefore aid in compliance
It would also assist in creating a more
level playing field for State and National system employers and employees.
Consideration
s 50(2) of the IR Act, UnionsWA has standing to apply to the Commission for
a General Order relating to an industrial matter.
proposed General Order relates to an industrial matter for the purpose of
Commission may make a General Order limited to employees who are employed under
and subject to awards: s 50(3)(a). Such an order
may be limited to awards
specified in the General Order: s 50(4).
provisions of s 50(5), s 50(6), s 50(7) and s 51B of the IR
Act do not apply to this application.
of the initial hearing of the application was given in accordance with s 51BA(1)
and published as required by s 51BA(1)(b)
in the January 2025
Industrial Gazette and on the Commission’s website.
are satisfied that, for the reasons advanced by all of the parties, it is
appropriate to make a General Order in the terms sought
by UnionsWA with three
minor variations. We are satisfied that the issue of a General Order is
consistent with the IR Act’s
objects of facilitating the efficient
organisation and performance of work according to the needs of industry and
enterprises within
it, balanced with fairness to employees, and providing a
system of fair wages and conditions of employment. In particular, the General
Order will:
awards do not contain casual rates of pay that are below the statutory minimum
rates for casual employees;
align State system employers and employees with those operating under the
National system so that State system employees who
are employed as casuals are
not comparatively disadvantaged;
the administrative burden on employers in applying casual rates of
compliance with minimum conditions;
greater consistency for local governments where multiple awards apply; and
the flattening effect on relativities created by the increase to the statutory
minimum casual rate of pay, ensuring that casual
employees are fairly paid in
recognition of their skills and classifications.
minor variations we make to the General Order as sought is to remove the
Performers Live Award 1993
from the Schedule attached to the General
Order, which lists the awards affected by the General Order. From 1 January
Performers Live Award 1993
was renamed the
Live Performance
and contains 25% minimum casual loadings:
Review of the
Performers Live Award (WA) 1993 Pursuant to
Industrial Relations
(2025) WAIRC 00011
(2025) 105 WAIG 55.
We have also
amended awards 16 and 17 of the Awards List to reflect these awards’
current titles, namely the:
Building Trades and Labourers (Construction)
Building Trades and Labourers (General) Award.
Date of Commencement of the General Order
has proposed that the General Order take effect on and from the date that it is
issued. It submits that the anomalies ought
to be rectified as soon as is
practicable. It notes that previous General Orders which have established
minimum rates of pay in awards
have taken effect from the first pay period
following the orders’ issue: see
2008 General Order
Minimum Award Wages in Some Awards
[2008] WAIRC 00327
(2008) 88 WAIG
2007 General Order
Re Minimum Award Wages in Some
[2007] WAIRC 00382
(2007) 87 WAIG 735)
to establish wage
structures for school based and part time apprentices. It also notes that the
State Wage Case (
) determinations have taken effect within periods of
3 to 14 days of their date of issue.
Minister did not advance a position in relation to the date of effect of any
Chamber proposed an operative date which is concurrent with the 2025 SWC
General Order. It advanced this position for three reasons.
First because the
often do not have a human resources
team to keep abreast of substantial changes
to the industrial relations system. Such employers are also the ones most likely
impacted by any change affected by the 2025 SWC. They are more likely
to be attuned to the increase as a result of SWC, being accustomed
cycle and a General Order issued outside the SWC timeframe is less likely to
come to their attention.
the Chamber says a single date for adjustments for both the SWC and a casual
loading General Order will also minimise the
administrative load on
the Chamber says that concurrency with the SWC order will result in a more
efficient use of the Commission’s, the Department
of the Registrar, of the
Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s and the Department of
Energy, Mines, Industry
Regulation and Safety’s resources, if the process
of updating awards and award summaries is concurrent.
advised the Commission in Court Session that it has consulted with its local
government members who are respondents to awards
named in the application. As a
result of this consultation, WALGA submits that any General Order should take
effect no earlier than
one month from the date it is determined, to allow time
for affected local government employers to adjust their payroll and other
we appreciate the Chamber’s consideration of the Commission’s and
Departments’ resourcing, we do not consider
this is a factor we ought to
take into account in determining the timing of a General Order taking effect.
do consider that the timing should be such as to optimise the likelihood of
compliance balanced with the desire to deter non-compliance
with the statutory
minimum rates by allowing confusion and anomalies to prevail longer than is
necessary. The SWC is not due to be
determined until before
1 July 2025. That could be a point in time five months after the
commencement of the increase to the minimum
casual rate of pay in the MCE
In our view, that is too long a period to allow the current
anomalous and confusing position to endure.
one month period following the publication of the General Order under
s 51BE of the IR Act, is more appropriate and will provide
of a buffer period to enable affected employers and employees to become informed
of the General Order and to make the necessary
adjustments to payroll systems.
thank all parties who participated in these proceedings for their helpful
written submissions and efficient conduct of this matter.
Special thanks to
UnionsWA for its careful consideration of the terms of the proposed General
will issue a General Order in the terms of the attached schedule.
1.- APPLICATION
General Order applies to casual employees subject to the awards cited in the
