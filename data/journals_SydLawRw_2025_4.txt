Beyond Restorative Justice: Prioritising Deliberative
Self-Determination in Indigenous Sentencing Court Systems
Indigenous Sentencing Courts (‘ISCs’) are inadequately understood
solely as restorative justice institutions. Instead,
an alternative theory
— ‘deliberative democracy’ — may help us analyse and
understand the value of these
By examining a cross-section of ISC systems throughout Australian
I argue that the cultural and political aims associated with the introduction
of ISCs calls for an alternative theory that takes greater
account of the
participatory role of Elders and Respected Persons and the broader social impact
these courts seek to make. A broadened
understanding of ISCs’ value to
both state justice systems and Indigenous goals of self-determination emerges by
considering
the extent to which ISCs offer inclusive, authentic, and
consequential deliberation to Elders and Respected Persons who assist the
in reaching a sentencing decision.
I Introduction
In this article, I use the term ‘Indigenous Sentencing Courts’
(‘ISCs’) to refer generally to Indigenous sentencing
‘court’ systems (also known as ‘circle sentencing
courts’) as introduced in state and territory jurisdictions
Australia.1F
As specialist
sentencing institutions, ISCs are inadequately understood through theories of
restorative justice and therapeutic jurisprudence.
In this article, I put
forward deliberative democracy as an alternative framework for understanding the
value of these courts. Cultural
and political objectives associated with the
introduction of ISCs are at odds with traditional sentencing principles and
narrow measures
of efficacy. Instead, ISCs, as internally deliberative
institutions, are best understood through the lens of ideals associated with
deliberative democracy, which prioritises and provides an evaluative framework
for assessing the quality of the deliberation that
occurs within these court
sites, and the positive effect this deliberation might have on the broader
intercultural dialogue between
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultures and their
respective justice systems. When evaluated based upon ideals such as whether
deliberation takes place in an
consequential
manner, the value of ISCs as systems for enabling
Indigenous communities’ meaningful participation and self-determination in
justice processes is brought into the foreground. Deliberative democracy
provides a lens to assess the positive outcomes of ISCs
that differs greatly
from commonly used and simplistic measures of efficacy relied upon by
governments, such as rehabilitation of
the offender and recidivism rates.
In Part II of this article, I discuss the history of ISCs. I focus on the
distinct aims and objectives under which ICSs are promoted,
and how their
operational structures differ to that of mainstream court systems. Taking these
distinct aims, objectives and structures
into account highlights that
traditional theories of restorative justice and therapeutic jurisprudence are
inadequate for assessing
the value of these courts. Furthermore, theories of
restorative justice prioritise normative sentencing principles such as
‘public interest [in the] rehabilitation of the offender and
avoidance of recidivism’ over the broader aims and goals
of Indigenous
In Part III of this article, I examine deliberative democracy as an applied
theory, considering its efficacy and appropriateness as
an alternative
evaluative framework. I discuss how deliberative democracy is defined, and
whether the theory, as articulated as part
of a western philosophical tradition,
should be used as a framework of analysis. I then argue that Dryzek’s
deliberative capacity
hallmarks of inclusivity, authenticity and
consequentiality offer an evaluative framework in which the procedure and
internally deliberative
aspects of ISCs may be examined, specifically the
deliberation between Indigenous Elders and presiding judicial officers.
Furthermore,
I examine deliberative democracy’s record in applied
Finally, in Part IV I bring ISCs and deliberative democracy together. I
examine how the laws governing ISCs enable legitimate deliberation
by Indigenous
Elders and Respected Persons, and identify factors that may undermine this
legitimacy. I conclude that evaluating ISCs
based upon the presence or absence
of deliberative capacity hallmarks promotes a shared language or hybridity
between legal systems
where both legal systems may be more amenable to mutually
inform and understand the values of the other.
II Indigenous Sentencing Courts and Restorative
ISCs are specialist
established in most Australian states and territories by governments, and
designed to reform sentencing for Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander
individuals through culturally appropriate and inclusive practices. ISCs operate
at multiple levels of the judicial
system. For example, in Victoria, the Koori
Court operates at the Children’s Court, Magistrates’ Court and
County Court
levels with respect to both summary and indictable
The Australian Law Reform Commission (‘ALRC’) reported that ISCs
attempt to engage the accused through ‘individualised
management’ and aim to address ‘underlying issues in culturally
appropriate ways, including by having Elders participate
in sentencing
discussion’.
It is through this participation that ISCs seek to enable a process of
accountability to the accused’s
The involvement of Elders in the sentencing process is the central focus of this
ISCs focus solely on the sentencing phase of the criminal justice process and
require the accused to have entered a guilty plea prior
to the matter being
heard. Broadly speaking, ISC systems operate alongside, and at the discretion,
of mainstream courts, who refer
matters for sentencing to the ISC where certain
conditions are met. ISCs are created and governed by specific
state/territory-based
statutes or court practice
directions.
These rules also prescribe the circumstances when matters can be transferred to
an ISC. Different Australian state and territory
eligibility requirements. For example, the accused is generally required to
satisfy a range of specific
identification, plea and consent requirements for
the ISC to have
ISCs emphasise a culturally sensitive and inclusive format. In contrast to
standard courts, judicial officers sit at eye level with
offenders and lawyers
are positioned similarly. Indigenous Elders or Respected Persons assisting with
proceedings do so to represent
the accused’s community and contribute to
the decision-making process. While the role and participation of Elders and
Persons varies between jurisdictions, as will be seen, this
participation has historically been characterised in restorative or therapeutic
justice terms.9F
Background to Indigenous Sentencing
The Australian Criminal Sentencing System
The Australian criminal sentencing system, informed by the common law,
operates largely pursuant to state and territory
legislation.10F
systems, in both their design and operation, seek to promote principled and
purposeful sentencing
decisions.11F
The normative
sentencing principles of the Australian criminal justice system include
‘punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation
of the offender, offender
accountability, denunciation of the offender’s conduct, community
protection, and recognition of
the seriousness of the offence and harm to the
This is reflected in legislation. For example, under
(Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
(NSW) the purposes of sentencing are defined
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from
committing similar offences,
(c) to protect the community from the offender,
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the
Additional sentencing principles have emerged in some
challenges faced by Indigenous
peoples.13F
In evaluating the efficacy of sentencing programs (including specialist
courts), policymakers have given great attention to their
effect on rates of
recidivism in determining the deterrent effect of any particular policy
platform. In 2018 the ALRC reported that
[n]ationally, the proportion of prisoners with a prior record of imprisonment
was very high: three quarters (76%) of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander
prisoners and half (49%) of non-Indigenous prisoners in 2016 had been in custody
on at least one previous
occasion.14F
ALRC noted however, among other things, that ‘prior record is not a
measure of recidivism’ and that it is ‘incorrect
to conclude that,
because 76% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners may be repeat
offenders, the recidivism rate is

inaccuracy of ‘prior record’

generally.16F
Further, as will
be discussed
below, reliance on recidivism rates may lead to

In 1999, the first formalised Australian ISC was established in South
Australia.18F
The only remaining
Australian jurisdiction yet to adopt an ISC system is
Tasmania.19F
The legislative
design and operation of ISCs varies between Australian states and territories.
Some courts, such as the Victorian
Koori Courts emphasise participation of the
Aboriginal community, while others, such as the Galambany Court in the
Australian Capital
Territory (ACT), prioritise restorative justice
In most jurisdictions across Australia, these courts complement mainstream
judicial and criminal justice systems. ISCs, as Stobbs

are diverse among jurisdictions, with nuanced procedural differences at each

ISCs’ point of difference is that they provide an opportunity for
participation in the process by Indigenous Elders or Respected

Threshold requirements must be met for a matter to be heard by an ISC. These
include Aboriginal

whereby the

Marchetti and Daly have identified three key reasons why governments have
sought to establish ISCs.33F
First, they aim to ‘reduce the over-representation of Indigenous people in
custody’.34F
Second, they
may provide an ‘opportunity for governments to address key
recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal

recommendations included ‘reducing Indigenous incarceration, increasing
the participation of Indigenous people in the
justice system as court staff or
advisors, and identifying mechanisms for Indigenous communities to resolve
disputes and deal with
offenders in culturally appropriate
Third, ISCs have
been established to complement Aboriginal Justice Agreements
to the issue of over
incarceration.37F
Each jurisdiction differs in the types of offences that can be heard in their
ISC system. Victoria takes a broad approach, for example
the Koori Court, at the
Magistrates’ Court level, can hear all offences able to be finalised in
the Magistrates’ Court,38F
with the exception of sexual
offences.39F
offences where the matter cannot

Key Features and Values of Indigenous Sentencing
Central to ISCs is the inclusion and involvement of community. In the ACT,
the Galambany Court aims to provide ‘effective and
restorative processes
to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander defendants through community
involvement in
sentencing’.42F
Ngunnawal word ‘galambany’ is understood to mean ‘we all,
including you’, indicative of the aim of community
participation.43F
establishment of the Victorian Koori Court, the Honourable Justin Madden stated
during the second reading speech that
the Koori Court aimed to create
an informal and accessible atmosphere ... allowing greater participation by the
Aboriginal community through the Koori [E]lder or
[R]espected [P]erson,
Aboriginal justice worker, [I]ndigenous offenders and their extended families or
wide group of connected kin,
and if desired, victims in the [C]ourt and
and Respected Persons appear in advisory capacities to the Magistrate, and are
tasked with speaking with the offender, and
providing views to the Magistrate
community.45F
In some ISC
systems, Elders and Respected Persons may be involved in interviewing the
defendant, preparing written pre-sentence reports
to the Magistrate, and may
assist with post-sentence monitoring and
support.46F
How Indigenous Sentencing Courts Fit within the
Restorative Justice Framework
The term ‘restorative justice’ is largely attributed to Albert
for whom restorative
justice was one of three ‘forms’ of criminal justice: retributive,
distributive and restorative.48F
The term ‘restorative justice’ was defined by Tony Marshall in his
1999 UK Home Office study as ‘a process whereby
parties with a stake in a
specific offence collectively resolve how to deal with the aftermath of the
offence and its implications
future’.49F
Latimer, Dowden and Muise argued that the term restorative justice is used
interchangeably with concepts such as ‘community
justice, transformative
justice, peacemaking criminology, and relational
The term ‘therapeutic jurisprudence’ is also often used, and
confused, in discourse concerning restorative
justice.51F
It is important to
distinguish therapeutic jurisprudence, which is defined as ‘the study of
how the law, its officials, processes
and institutions affect the people who
come under its
influence’.52F
Therapeutic
jurisprudence applies many restorative justice principles, however this term
inherently pathologises the defendant. Therapeutic
jurisprudence is associated
with so-called ‘solution-focused judging’, whereby the court becomes
a ‘facilitator
of change’ as opposed to ‘solv[ing] a
participant’s
“problems”’.53F
Restorative justice includes three key ‘elements’: voluntariness,
truth-telling and a face-to-face
encounter.54F
In summary, the
aims of restorative justice are: voluntariness for all participants; an
acceptance of responsibility by the offender;
‘open and honest’
discussion by the offender about the criminal conduct; and the meeting of
participants in ‘safe
and organized’ settings whereby ‘an
appropriate method of repairing the harm’ can be
Restorative justice
facilitates restoring relationships and provides the community with
opportunities for healing by reintegrating
victims and
offenders.56F
Common restorative justice practices include victim-offender mediation,
conferencing, and circle and forum
sentencing.57F
These processes
have been implemented in Australia through various pieces of state and territory
legislation, such as the
Crimes (Restorative Justice) Act 2004
which outlines key restorative justice principles such as: empowering victims;
bringing together victims, offenders and supporters
in a safe environment; and
prioritising victims’
interests.59F
Limitations
in Viewing Indigenous Sentencing Courts through the Lens of Restorative
When distinguished from other specialist courts that apply restorative
justice principles, ISCs may not necessarily involve victims
and, instead, take
an ‘offender-centred
approach’.60F
For example,
the County Koori Court purports to seek inclusive changes to shift the
‘court-community relationships’ by
promoting ‘effective
communication between the offender and the judicial officer [and] reliance on
Indigenous knowledge in
the sentencing process ... and the use of penalties
better suited to the circumstances of the
There is also a focus on accountability to community and priority given to
considering the circumstances of the
defendant.62F
Additionally, ISCs
have distinct policy aims that reside outside a restorative justice framing:
namely, reducing Indigenous incarceration
and responding to justice issues
specific to Indigenous
communities.63F
Many ISCs were
established in view of the goals and ambitions set out in now-expired Aboriginal
Justice Agreements between state
governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander communities.64F
recent agreements in Victoria demonstrate continued advocacy by Indigenous
stakeholders to expand and shape the development
of the Koori Court system while
aspiring to ‘establish justice institutions to exercise
self-determination’ and ‘greater
authority’.65F
Tauri has argued that restorative justice is enmeshed within a
‘colonial project of crime control’ and is ‘complicit
settler-colonial state’s continuing subjugation of Indigenous
peoples’.66F
argued that restorative justice needs to grapple with the political context in
which the theory is situated and the means
by which it
operates.67F
We should query
whether the aims of restorative justice, and its practices, align with the aims
of Indigenous peoples, ISCs and broader
justice policy initiatives aimed at
redressing legacies of settler-colonial harm. In this respect, alternative
theoretical framing
is necessary to understand and evaluate these courts.
Restorative justice, as an organising framework, inadequately reflects the
broader aims and objectives of Indigenous peoples with
respect to the justice
scope has been redefined and repackaged by governments, whereby its practices
and ideas are uncertain.69F
this reason, Daly has argued that restorative justice lacks clear
definition.70F
This has prompted
restorative justice advocates to ‘distinguish practices that are near and
far from the restorative
‘more than just an example of restorative justice or therapeutic
jurisprudence’; they are, in fact, ‘unique
themselves’.72F
and Daly, among others, have argued that because of this uniqueness, a similarly
‘unique theoretical and jurisprudential
required.73F
Payne has suggested
that ISCs, in the context of their broader influence on the justice system,
‘are politically concerned
with social change in race relations’, a
concern that goes beyond the scope of a restorative justice
paradigm.74F
Additionally,
Cunneen has argued the very efficacy of ISCs’ programs relies upon
separation from ‘state-sponsored’
restorative justice
The separation from restorative justice lies in ISCs’ ability to
empower Indigenous peoples and incorporate their ‘perspectives
values’ into the judicial and sentencing
process.76F
In this way, ISCs
have the potential to be socially and politically ‘transformative’,
at a variety of levels, rather
than merely
‘restorative’.77F
ISCs, while not perfect institutions, may be seen to go some way towards
answering Anthony’s call for a ‘postcolonial
paradigm’ that ‘deconstructs the asymmetrical relationship between
the colonizer’s [sic] law and Indigenous
laws’, providing agency to
Indigenous participants.78F
Self-Determination and Post-Colonial Objectives
The aims of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as a
‘political community’ and ‘constitutional
constituency’,79F
diverse and multifaceted in the ‘post-colonial’ context. Aboriginal
peoples in Australia have campaigned for societal
and structural transformation
of the justice system.80F
Fulfilling these aims requires a ‘transformative’ approach to
justice, as argued for by
Anthony.81F
This involves:
fostering a ‘parity of participation’ between Indigenous peoples and
the broader legal system in respect
of ‘legal norm creation and
dispensation’;82F
systems where Indigenous societies autonomously control and apply their
‘laws and governance structures to their
members’;83F
government engagement with Indigenous peoples which ‘decentres
postcolonial
These aims mirror some of the broader principles of self-determination
outlined in the
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
• ‘the right to self-determination’ (art 3)
• ‘the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating
to their internal and local affairs’ (art 4)
• ‘the right to participate in decision-making in matters
[affecting] their rights, through representatives chosen by
themselves in
accordance with their own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their
own indigenous [sic] decision-making
institutions’ (art 18); and
• a requirement that the State will ‘consult and cooperate in
good faith’ with Indigenous peoples with respect to
laws or administrative
measures that may affect them (art 19).
Achieving self-determination has been deemed necessary by Indigenous leaders
to: further Indigenous participation and autonomy in
Australian parliaments,
public life and
institutions;
address a lack of institutional accountability to Indigenous
peoples;87F
‘representative’ self-governance structures that ‘mediate the
interface with Australian
governments’;88F
disadvantage and the ‘effects of past discrimination’ by
‘enabling equal
rights’;89F
and ensure the
‘views of Indigenous people’ are taken into account in relation to
laws that affect them.90F
Indigenous Elders themselves have argued for a coalescence of ‘Indigenous
and non-Indigenous law’ so that they may ‘recognise
other’, in order to achieve a ‘two-way understanding between
Indigenous and non-Indigenous laws so one does not

Marchetti has argued that the recidivism metric is relied upon where
policymakers seek to make funding
This leaves programs at risk of closure where the results are less than
satisfactory.97F
For example, in
2015 Western Australia abolished two sentencing court systems, the Geraldton
Bandimalgu Court, which specialised
in family violence offences, and the
Kalgoorlie Community Court.98F
The former was abolished following ‘a 2014 evaluation that found that
while rates of reoffending were lower, the difference
was not statistically
significant’.99F
However, ‘the Kalgoorlie Community Court was abolished following an
evaluation that found that recidivism rates were higher
than in mainstream
courts’.100F
noted that in 2012 the Queensland Murri Court system was temporarily abolished
due to its failure to reduce recidivism
Criticisms of ISCs with respect to offender recidivism rely foremost on
empirical data and positivist
metrics.102F
A study of the
Nowra Circle Court
cautioned against the accuracy of an exclusive statistical or qualitative
analysis of rates of recidivism. It advocated for a mix
of qualitative and
statistical data, to get a better understanding of recidivism on the basis that

is an uneven
process.103F
has proposed evaluating ISCs through a range of metrics, whereby recidivism is
viewed ‘as just one measure of success’
others.104F
Anthony has
argued that the focus on metrics like reduced recidivism, deterrence and
community protection construe Indigeneity ‘as
factor’.105F
seemingly neutral research metrics might also be seen as tools of the dominant
institution to entrench its
For ISCs to be properly evaluated in a way that truly reflects their purposes,
attention should instead be paid to how measures and
their respective methods
could ‘reflect Indigenous-centric values and
knowledges’.107F
Marchetti has written, ISCs may be ‘achieving outcomes’ that are not
measured by ‘policy-driven
evaluations’.108F
might include other aims outlined in the ALRC report, such as ‘increased
attendance rates, and “... better and
more culturally relevant sentencing
process”’.109F
Restorative Justice Deprioritises the
Post-Colonial Objectives of Aboriginal People
ISCs espouse qualities associated with remediating the longstanding legacies
of colonialism, including: reducing Indigenous incarceration;
opportunities for governments to respond to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal
Deaths in Custody; and complementing formal
arrangements, such as former
Aboriginal Justice Agreements between Indigenous stakeholders and governments.
Additionally, ISCs claim
to offer opportunities to provide inclusive and
reflective sentencing that is culturally appropriate.
Restorative justice framing places emphasis on procedural qualities such as:
process for the defendant; encouragement to accept
responsibility for offences prior to being sentenced; prioritising open and
discussion through the inclusion of Elders and Respected Persons; and
safe and organised engagement of participants through culturally
appropriate
formats. However, restorative justice at a procedural level is predominantly
centred on addressing the needs of victims,
as demonstrated by the
(Restorative Justice) Act 2004
The aims of ISCs
are, however, arguably different to those of restorative justice, in that they
are concerned with societal considerations
beyond the victim, take an
offender-centred approach focused on accountability to community, and give
consideration to the defendant’s
circumstances.
The restorative justice paradigm limits the extent to which the necessary

place to bring about ‘a cultural and political transformation of the
law’ to empower Indigenous communities
in the justice
process.112F
‘transformative approach’ to
justice,113F
articulated by Fraser and described by Anthony, is intrinsically part of a
broader discussion concerning the ‘post-colonial’
Indigenous peoples.114F
Restorative justice framing positions these goals outside of orthodox sentencing
and justice considerations, and reinforces settler-colonial
objectives through
the use of narrow evaluative metrics and targets. In this mode, reducing
offender recidivism becomes the dominant
‘“rationale for the use of
specialist Aboriginal
courts”’.115F
a result, ISC outcomes are unfairly evaluated against the backdrop of mainstream
sentencing processes. Empirical and positivist
metrics of recidivism rates
constitute a narrow evaluative measure of ISC efficacy and position Indigeneity
to be viewed through
This ignores
broader ‘post-colonial’ aims associated with the formation of ISCs,
including empowering Indigenous communities
within the justice
process.117F
III Deliberative Democratic Theory
Deliberative democracy, a multi-modal theory, with a so-called
has been applied in a range of other research contexts to analyse both micro and
macro deliberation. Central to its inquiry, the
theory asks
a site or forum should be accepted as legitimate by its participants.
The theory provides criteria capable of evaluating the processes,
outcomes and
substance of institutions like ISCs both as discrete decision-making sites and
as institutions concerned with broader
societal change. To examine whether
deliberative democracy can be applied as an evaluative framework in relation to
the efficacy
and value of ISCs, we must first define the broader concept of
deliberative democracy, consider why the theory is an appropriate
framework, and finally examine whether it is capable of application in a justice
system context.
Defining ‘Deliberative
Deliberative democracy, as defined by Gutmann and Thompson, is a framework
through which decisions and policies made within a democracy
are justified
because they are agreed through a process of ‘discussion among free and
equal citizens or their accountable
representatives’.
Deliberation
in the context of a ‘deliberative democracy’
refers to a ‘distinctive communicative practice’ involving
‘reason-giving
and mutual justification’ or
reciprocity.120F
reason-giving process requires a ‘transmission of ideas, proposals, and
discourses’
and ‘no force except that of the better argument is [to be]
exercised’.
Beyond this core meaning, deliberative democracy can be seen as ‘a larger,
normative project’ that ‘encompasses
multiple other institutions and
practices’ including judicial
systems.123F
The relationship
between theories of deliberative democracy and legal systems is, as Levy and Orr
argue, ‘reflexive’
nature.124F
interconnected questions surround this relationship: first, ‘how [the] law
[in question] shapes, enables, or constrains
deliberation’; and second,
‘how deliberation shapes law, whether by generating new regulatory models
or understandings,
or reinforcing existing rules and their
interpretation’.125F
Should Deliberative Democracy Theory Be Applied
to Indigenous Sentencing Courts?
Why Deliberative Democracy?
ISCs are deliberative sites because of the nexus existing between the
collective deliberation of Elders and the Magistrate and the
sentencing decision. ISCs should be analysed in respect of their deliberative
qualities as there is a notable lack of scholarship
in this area. McCaul, among
others, has argued that historically Indigenous participation ‘in
decision-making in Australia
is ... denied, ignored, or partial at
According to McCaul, deliberative engagement between Indigenous peoples and the
State is ‘under-theorised’ and ‘therefore
largely absent in
the literature of deliberative
democracy’.127F
Deliberative democracy is positioned to resolve asymmetries or
incommensurability between dominant non-Indigenous law and Indigenous
because the theory recognises different models and practices of
In order to do so, we should consider deliberative democracy’s relevance
to institutional design, and how it can be used to
level the playing
When informed by
deliberative democratic values, appropriately designed ISC institutions might
serve to empower Indigenous communities
in the justice system, by including
Elders in the decision-making process where they have, in the past, been
excluded. From a design
perspective, ‘community based deliberative
spaces’, a description that ISCs in some ways might be able to meet,
offer ... insights into democratisation processes “from
below” that are more participatory than representative forms
democracy’ because social relations are based on ‘Indigenous notions
of reciprocity and exchange, rather than
competition’.130F
Should Deliberative Democracy Be Understood as a
Philosophy Rooted in Western Philosophical Tradition?
Banerjee has argued that ‘Enlightenment reasoning and philosophies of
history provided an intellectual justification of more
than two hundred years of
colonialism’.131F
points to deliberative democracy’s ‘quest for consensus’
which, he claims, ignores ‘legacies of colonialism
and structural
inequalities that persist in contemporary
societies’.132F
scholarship shows that deliberative democracy scholars are alive to critical
discussions concerning
colonialism.133F
highlights that examples of deliberative and consensus-based decision-making are
evident across cultures and
societies.134F
regard, the normative principles of deliberative democracy are not, and should
not, be understood as part of a dominant western
paradigm.135F
Instead, it has
been said that the scholarship surrounding deliberative democracy, as a theory,
is intellectually hegemonic in that
it is ‘dominated by West-centric
frameworks, paradigms, and
cases’.136F
Ibhawoh has
argued that, in view of this, scholars should pay close attention to ‘the
silences, omissions, and erasures of
liberal democratic discourses’ and

Another critique in respect of deliberative democracy’s application is
that the Australian justice system, in its present form,

have made convincing arguments for deliberative democracy’s applicability
in the face of coercive power. For
example, Valadez has argued that deliberative
democracy functions as an appropriate analytical theory in ‘societies

the Australian context. Valadez highlights deliberative democracy’s focus
on mutual understanding, inclusive public
discourse, and achieving outcomes

In this article,
I argue that deliberative democracy presents a mode capable of reimagining
the justice system’s priorities, and may, in the
same way contemplated by
McCaul, lead to an opening up of ‘deliberative space for greater
engagement with the state and Indigenous
governance’ and potentially
overcome the limitations of ‘existing structures of representative
democracy’.

Analysing Indigenous Sentencing Courts as
Decision-Making Sites
Deliberative democracy provides a set of criteria to examine specialist court
institutions like ISCs from both micro and macro
perspectives.
ISCs, when understood as micro-scale, discrete decision-making institutions, are

in that ‘decisions are devolved’ to be made by
themselves.151F
observable nexus between the ‘collective deliberation’ (in this
case, the deliberation between Elders and the
Judge at each hearing, albeit
limited by legislative constraints) and the decision-making process (the
sentencing decision) that
make ISCs appropriate for deliberative
evaluation.152F
Deliberative democracy is distinct from restorative justice in that it asks
why and how an institutional site or forum, such as a
court, should be accepted
as legitimate, through normative and descriptive inquiry. Criticism made of the
theory’s utopian
ideals,153F
in fact, draws
into focus its greatest strength: its position to critique socially complex
institutional spaces.154F
theory asks whether a particular democratic site or forum demonstrates
particular ‘normative presuppositions of communication’
‘immanent norms’, such as the site’s capacity to enable free
and equal communication between
participants.155F
norms, and other related hallmarks, become usable criteria on the basis of which
a normative analysis of ISCs can take place.
This approach is consistent with
scholars such as Scudder, White, Owen and Smith who, among others, call for a
focus less on locating
a ‘practice’ of deliberative democracy and
more on its ‘normative
contribution’.
Deliberative democracy’s so-called ‘procedural approach’
asks us to query whether ISCs are, at an operational and
procedural level,
capable of enabling free deliberation between Elders and the
Magistrate.157F
As Neblo has
written, the approach ‘attempt[s] to map the theory’s key concepts
into an operational
However, there are also limitations with taking the procedural approach in
isolation, given its lack of consideration towards ‘substantive’
elements, such as ‘equal

Deliberative democratic sites must be seen to be legitimate in the eyes of

Böker’s approach queries ‘what normative demands of legitimacy
are implicit in the theory of deliberative
democracy’.164F
Deliberative legitimacy is predicated on participants within a system
‘claim[ing] their right to
justification’.165F
Dryzek has written that institutions that have capacity for deliberation are
legitimate’.166F
legitimacy of any deliberative site can therefore be understood in reference to
its capacity for deliberation: deliberative capacity.
The Hallmarks of Deliberative
According to Dryzek, deliberative capacity
requires the satisfaction
of key criteria, namely that the deliberation is ‘authentic, inclusive,
and consequential’.167F
Dryzek has proposed that ‘[a] polity with a high degree of authentic,
inclusive, and consequential deliberation will have an
effective deliberative
system’.168F
criteria indicate effective deliberative democratic sites and the
‘standards of legitimacy’ by which they may be
deliberation can broadly be understood to mean deliberation
that induces reflection without coercion and seeks to ‘connect claims
more general principles, and exhibit
reciprocity’.170F
Coercion, as an ‘anti-deliberative’ force includes the use of
‘brute strength’, ‘the identity and status
of speakers’,
or ‘majority feeling’ to undermine
deliberation.
As Neblo has argued, achieving authentic deliberation can be seen as the means
to securing ‘authentic deliberative buy-in’
decisions.172F
When buy-in is
achieved, individuals ‘recognize [decisions] as reasonable and ... embrace
them as their own’.173F
This is essential for participants to feel meaningfully
engaged.174F
deliberation, as argued by Dryzek, is less a requirement of
deliberation itself, and instead a criterion to establish deliberative
‘inclusive’ requires that ‘a broad range of interests, ideas,
and positions are permitted so that people
encounter a plurality of
views’.176F
Orr argue that
[i]nclusive decision-making can be more epistemically rigorous and can yield
decisions more responsive and acceptable to a broad
cross-section of citizens.
Conversely, when ‘entire social perspectives – such as those of
minorities or women –
are excluded from the political arena’ the
problematic result is ‘an impoverishment of political

process.181F
A study of an
Australian Citizens’ Parliament held in Canberra found that the
‘resonance of consequentiality’ among
participants gave participants
a feeling of an ‘empowered
space’.182F
feeling is present in ISCs — through their involvement in deliberation
within the space, Elders and Respected Persons
have an opportunity to
‘re-establish [their] authority, reinvigorate cultural protocols and
self-government’.
Sass and Dryzek have described the consequentiality hallmark as capable of
being ‘assessed in terms of the impact of deliberative
participation on
collective outcomes such as public policies, but also on social norms, and on
the nature of the relationships between
different social
groups’.184F
Consequential and impactful deliberation by Elders and Respected Persons in ISCs
might broadly involve:
• deliberating in relation to the nature and particulars of the
sentencing decision, including its duration;
• feeling they, or their community, have had a voice in the dominant
state-administered justice process;
• their voice was accepted as legitimate within the process; and
• preservation of the distinctiveness and authority of Indigenous laws
and customs in the face of the state justice
process.185F
Beyond the mere procedural considerations of Dryzek’s hallmarks,
substantive principles such as ‘basic liberty and fair
opportunity’
should be considered.186F
the decision-making process, ‘mutually justifiable reasons’ form the
basis of a ‘mutually binding’ decision
outcome.187F
For a Judge or
Magistrate to hand down a sentencing decision that represents a mutual position
of both the Elders and the Judge,
it would be necessary to consider whether
Elders have equal opportunity and individual liberty within the site. The
inclusion of
substantive principles within deliberative analysis is subject to
considerable
For example, to what extent should concepts of equality operate as a
deliberative ideal? One may argue that equality, as a distinct
hallmark of
deliberation, is present where all parties have equally engaged (equality of
outcome) or are capable of doing so (equality
opportunity).189F
However, as
will be discussed, issues exist with respect to the use of equality as a measure
or hallmark of deliberative legitimacy.
There are two key modes of analysis with respect to deliberative equality:
‘procedural’ and ‘substantive’
equality.190F
entangled because ‘formal equality remains a controversial procedural norm
in modern democracies’ as it does
not, in and of itself, grant
‘substantive equal opportunity in terms of political
influence’.
Trantidis has argued that this entanglement arises out of a circularity in which
‘unfair social conditions create unfair terms
of political participation
which, in turn, reproduce these social
conditions’.192F
argued that procedural equality requires the satisfaction of three normative
conditions: unrestricted domain, anonymity, and
neutrality.193F
According to
Trantidis, ‘formal procedural equality is criticised for systematically
disadvantaging certain groups such as
minorities’.194F
and Orr, however, propose that equality ‘has a more distinctive rationale

now we can dispense with an analysis of equality
as its own distinct criterion,
and instead revert wholly to the three hallmarks.
The Application of the Deliberative Democracy
Can Indigenous Sentencing Courts Be Understood as
Deliberative Democratic Sites?
Legislators, courts and policymakers involved in the design and promotion of
ISCs make claims that these court models are participatory
by reason of their
inclusion of Aboriginal Elders and Respected Persons. For example, The
Koori Court Practice Note
(Vic) states that
[t]he objective of the County Koori Court is to ensure greater participation of
the Aboriginal community in the sentencing process...
through the role played in
that process by the Aboriginal Elders or Respected Persons and others such as
the County Koori Court
Coordinator.197F

Persons,198F

circular, there is a teleological argument that ISCs, which make participatory
claims, should be assessed with an aligned theoretical
framework: deliberative
Some scholars have examined similar court specialist systems that they refer
to as ‘problem-solving’

policy.202F

recognisably deliberative in its ‘principles,

primarily with sentencing and

previously discussed, ISCs

‘institutional environment and conditions’
that hinder the
deliberative capacity of mainstream judicial

Hutt’s argument underlines some of the key limitations deliberative theory
faces with respect to legal institutions.

the adequacy of its practice to its
principles’.219F
Notably, he has argued that the theory cannot be empirically applied to analyse
the deliberative qualities of the
judiciary.220F
This is due to
a tendency by scholars to mistake ‘dialogue and argument exchange taking
place inside the courtroom’ as
demonstrative of deliberative democracy
principles.221F
According to
Hutt, courtroom dialogue and argument is a restricted form of deliberation, and
raises questions as to whether courts
are ‘ideal deliberative
institutions’.222F
Examples of the Application of the Deliberative
Democracy Framework in
Related Areas
Deliberative democracy theory has been effectively applied as an analytical
tool to a wide variety of institutions, processes and
forums. It asks questions
like ‘what are the barriers to deliberation?’ and can the
deliberative site (subject to analysis)
resolve ‘intractable social or
political issues’?223F
Similar questions can be posed in respect of specialist sentencing courts like
ISCs regarding both their role as institutions of
social change, capable of a
form of systemic deliberation within the broader justice system, and the
barriers to deliberation that
exist at a discrete, procedural or forum level.
These questions thereby set the focus on ISCs’ capacity (as discrete
for deliberation.
One example of deliberative democracy’s analytical application includes
Schouten, Leroy and Glasbergen’s use of Dryzek’s
deliberative
capacity analysis as a research strategy to examine ‘private
multi-stakeholder governance’
regimes.224F
studies assessed the deliberative capacity of governance roundtables where
stakeholders within a supply chain come together
to address industry-wide
concerns.225F
They found that
the roundtables fell short on ‘two out of three criteria of deliberative
capacity: inclusion and consequentiality’
and that there was a ‘lack
of transmission from deliberative processes outside the [r]oundtable setting to
deliberative processes
within’.226F
Schirmer, Dare and Ercan adopted aspects of Dryzek’s model in an
examination of ‘deliberative democracy and the Tasmanian
forest peace
process’, an engagement process initiated in 2009 that led to the
formation of the Tasmanian Forest
Agreement.227F
Five criteria
were used to assess the deliberative quality of the process: access to
deliberation, inclusiveness, deliberativeness,
openness and transparency, and
consequentiality.228F
noted that it was difficult for participatory processes to satisfy ‘all
five criteria of deliberative democracy equally
simultaneously’.229F
The study gained insights about the process and whether it was an ideal
deliberative site.230F
Schirmer, Dare and Ercan called for deliberative theorists to consider
‘how best to build incremental deliberative processes
in which succeeding
stages gradually build deliberative quality, rather than attempting to achieve
all normative criteria
simultaneously’.231F
Hébert has examined forms of deliberation by the Indigenous
Me’phaa people of Mexico with respect to ‘community
‘regional organisations’ and ‘national and international
movements’.232F
analysed how Me’phaa deliberation was ‘multi-scalar’ within
these contexts and took account of community fracturing
‘scission’ resulting from State administrative
policies.233F
Me’phaa demonstrated ‘consensus-making practices’ that
extended their political agency beyond the community-level
and into systemic and
global contexts.234F
Hébert found there was Indigenous political agency and that Indigenous
organisations played a role ‘in engaging the
state and affirming
self-determination’.235F
In 2004, Parkinson and Roche examined restorative justice through a
deliberative democracy
They concluded that
there were a ‘number of points of contact between deliberative democracy
and restorative justice’
and that the latter can be seen as an
‘institutional approximation’ for deliberative democratic
principles.237F
their research was limited in that it did not consider specialist court
institutions like ISCs.
Differentiating between Deliberative
Democracy’s Procedural, Output and Substantive Values
There are a number of observable alignments and differences between the
procedure, substance and output of deliberative democracy
theory and restorative
justice theory. Restorative justice is concerned with the substantive output of
decisions: namely, repairing
harms caused by
This involves an attempt to ‘restore victims, offenders and
communities’ by holding ‘offenders accountable for
crime in ways
that are constructive, but not punitive or harsh’ and reducing
‘victim fear towards the
offender’.239F
contrast, under deliberative democracy, the output focus is placed on achieving
a sense of legitimacy of process, by asking both
democratic legitimacy’ and ‘how we ought to think about
legitimacy’.240F
this sense, deliberative democracy is less concerned with the content of
decisions, rather, the quality of deliberation tells
us something about the
quality of the outcome and the process that gave rise to the
outcome.241F
Chambers has argued that at the procedural level deliberative democracy
prioritises inclusive communication practices, reason-giving
and equality of
participation.242F
procedural qualities are said to give rise to ‘legitimate outcomes’
for deliberative sites.243F
This is in contrast to restorative justice, which favours ‘the
facilitation of participation and communication between the
involved’ in order to give a voice to victims, and with a view towards an
agreed set of consequences that satisfy all
parties.244F
Restorative
justice, while emphasising dialogue and participation in the process by
offenders, victims and their
supporters,245F
attention ‘to the formalities of the criminal legal process or the voices
of legal actors
alone’.246F
In the case
of ISCs, Elder and Respected Person participation concerns communicating to the
defendant the ‘impact of the offence’,
inducing reflection or
remorse, and promoting acceptance of
responsibility.247F
At a substantive level, deliberative democracy is primarily centred on the
decision-making process itself and, as argued by Kanra,
achieving a form of
social learning by the
participants.248F
deliberative process involves ‘interaction between participants ... to
develop an understanding of each other’s
claims’.249F
of Elders and those of the Judge or Magistrate would, in an ideal ISC setting,
be assessed and evaluated by each other,
rather than a one-way information
giving exercise.250F
O’Doherty has noted, achieving ‘complementary goals’, such as
social learning, in order to produce better citizens
as well as better (social)
decisions has been contemplated by a number of
scholars.251F
Indigenous Sentencing Courts as
Deliberative Institutions
For the deliberation between Elders and sentencing judges to be legitimate,
participation must be inclusive, authentic and consequential.
These hallmarks
can be understood as measures of ‘relational
processes’.252F
Fundamental to self-determination, Hébert has argued that
‘Indigenous deliberation and agency go hand in
Hébert argued that the repression and short-circuiting of relational
processes and ‘undermining the particular forms
of authority that operate
within them’ are indicative of
coloniality.254F
By bringing
ISCs within a deliberative democracy framework, these relational processes can
be prioritised. While I have not sought,
in this article, to quantify these
participatory metrics, ISCs are deliberative sites that are capable of offering
a level of inclusive,
authentic and consequential deliberation. As such, an
affinity exists with deliberative democracy in a way that is absent within
paradigm strictly focused on restorative justice. In this respect, deliberative
democracy can, and should, be applied to ISCs as
an evaluative framework to
determine whether they are legitimate deliberative forums.
The Deliberative Relationship Between
Participants in the ISC Process: Elders, Respected Person and
Magistrates
Dryzek and Niemeyer have both argued that we can think about a deliberative
site’s impact in terms of the extent to which the
forum enables
deliberation, rather than its capacity to reach a
decision.255F
To do this, we
what degree the law surrounding ISCs
shapes, enables, or constrains these
qualities.256F
Inclusive Deliberation
From a conventional court perspective, the nature and formality of
stakeholder expression is constrained by the legal rules governing
processes, requiring views to be presented by way of oral or written
submissions. Courts have mechanisms that allow for inclusive
participation:
amici curiae257F
interveners.
After seeking leave, these third parties may be permitted to file submissions to
assist the court in resolving a point of fact or
law where it is ‘in the
interests of the administration of justice that the Court have the benefit of a
larger view of the
matter before it than the parties are able or willing to
offer’.259F
highlights ‘the long history of [amici curiae] being used by the judiciary
to overcome the shortcomings of the adversarial
litigation’.
This intervention ‘can enhance “the legitimacy of the court’s
decision particularly in those cases raising fundamental
social and moral
questions”’.261F
In this respect, conventional court processes exhibit inclusive elements that
are capable of promoting ‘underserved interests
to find entry into public
decision-making’.262F
The role of Elders and Respected Persons in sentencing might, in many ways,
be seen as an expansion of the curial process, without
the structural
constraints associated with amici curiae participation, in that they are able to
openly share their views with the
court and participate in the process. ISC laws
adopt a language of inclusivity within their mission objectives and statutory
provisions,
however, these same laws limit the extent to which Elders and
Respected Persons may be included and their views considered by the
Magistrate or Judge in reaching a sentencing
decision.263F
Drawing upon
the amici curiae
example, policymakers could expand the range of issues
on which Elders and Respected Persons may deliberate, and find ways to give
greater weight to their contribution in order to address counter-majoritarian
concerns about judicial
Listening to stakeholders is essential for inclusive
deliberation.
Burgess, Grice and Wood have argued that Aboriginal leading practices are
‘founded on deep listening, reciprocity, and
respect’.266F
Bobongie-Harris, Hromek and O’Brien have written that within Aboriginal
cultures, ‘listeners of the story [have] as much
responsibility to and for
the story as the
story-teller’.267F
extent to which a participant, Elder or Respected Person is truly listened to is
related to the extent to which they are included
in the deliberative process.
Aboriginal Elders and Respected Persons are leaders in their communities and
therefore the extent to
which this is recognised within an ISC may reflect its
overall deliberative character.
Defendants involved in the Victorian Koori Court have spoken of its
qualities for them as parties to the
proceeding.
They have noted that Elders ‘contribute to the sentencing discussion,
bringing their knowledge of community culture, values
kinship’.269F
Furthermore, Elders ‘directly engage the [a]ccused’ and foster
‘community participation in the delivery of justice’
also speak directly to the [a]ccused about their behaviour and its effect upon
the community’.270F
Through this role, Elders have been able to ‘provide information on the
background of the [a]ccused and possible reasons for
the offending
behaviour’.271F
explain to the Magistrate or Judge the kinship and family connections, advise on
cultural practices and protocols, and provide
their ‘perspectives relevant
to sentencing’.272F
Communication, for it to be inclusive,
must be understood by both the
giver and receiver of information. Unsurprisingly, there are notable language
barriers for Aboriginal
speakers engaged in court

date, scholarship has largely been confined to the effects of miscommunication
‘between Indigenous offenders and legal professionals’,
further research is needed in relation to the linguistic impact on Elders and
Respected Persons deliberating with
judges.276F
Authentic Deliberation and Deliberative
Authentic deliberation ‘induces reflection’ without
coercion.277F
Reflection is
defined broadly as ‘a fixing of the thoughts on something; careful
consideration’, ‘a thought occurring
in consideration or
meditation’, and ‘the casting of some imputation or
reproach’.278F
refers to structures or practices antithetical to rational forms of
deliberation.279F
Respected Persons who take part in ISCs are subject to coercion through the
legal rules that structure their
deliberations;280F
they are subject to the statutory authority exercised by the Magistrate or Judge
presiding over the
hearing.281F
In most ISC
‘advisory’ positions to the Magistrate
or Judge who retains all
sentencing discretion.282F
Whether, and to what extent, the views of Elders or Respected Persons are taken
into account is ultimately at the discretion of the
presiding magistrate and
therefore, the authenticity of deliberation between the Elders or Respected
Persons and the Magistrate may
be seen to be diminished. The limited scope of
participation raises questions as to whether the laws governing ISCs enable what
describes as deliberative
‘buy-in’.283F
This goes to the heart of whether the common
of Elders and
Respected Persons is in fact meaningfully represented as part of the ISC
process. Acknowledging the ‘coercive
power’ of the laws governing
ISCs, policymakers should consider the overall procedural design of ISCs and
whether their design
marginalises, includes or constrains deliberation by
certain stakeholders.285F
Consequential Deliberation
For deliberation to be ‘consequential’
there must be an
‘impact’ upon ‘collective decisions or social
outcomes’.286F
the participation of Elders must in turn ‘lead to actual
results’.287F
scholars, such as Blagg and Anthony, have argued for a greater jurisdictional
remit for ISCs as opposed to them being used in
an ‘ad-hoc manner’
at the ‘discretion of the
Magistrate’.288F
Australia, ISCs do not presently
provide authority to the Elders to determine the sentence. Rather, they provide
advice to the sentencing Judge or Magistrate, drawing
on the Indigenous
community’s expectations and awareness of appropriate avenues, programs
and supports for the individuals
involved and their families. Ultimately, the
magistrate or judge determines the sentence and the extent to which the views of
are taken into account, if at all. This is regarded by certain Elders,
[within] the Yolŋu and Warlpiri communities as an inadequate
model given

While these
non-curial forms of consequential engagement are present, truly consequential
deliberation, in respect of sentencing
outcome, is ultimately constrained by
legislative and constitutional imperatives. In this way, ISC models appear
presently to lack
true deliberative legitimacy for Elder and Respected Person
participants.

Gutmann and Thompson have claimed that deliberative democracy framing cannot
‘“make incompatible values compatible, but
it can help participants
recognize moral merit in their opponents’ claim”, and achieve a
shared sense of
legitimacy’.304F
this sense, a deliberative democratic framing may serve to promote
commensurability between non-Indigenous and Indigenous justice
practices by
fostering intercultural
This may lead to the generation of ‘new regulatory models or
understandings’.306F
The understandings or legal interpretations arrived at through deliberation may
promote recognition of Indigenous legal systems and
thus serve to generate
commensurability or ‘interlegality’ between
Where ISCs are able to offer legitimate deliberation to stakeholders that is
seen to be authentic, inclusive and consequential, broader
power imbalances and
the incommensurability between Indigenous law and dominant non-Indigenous law
may, to an extent, resolve. From
this inter-system level, the deliberative
hallmarks function to prioritise ‘meaningful communication’ and
recognition’ between
cultures.308F
In turn, this may work towards decolonising ‘institutional patterns of
subordination’309F
creating forms of ‘hybrid justice’ that include
‘inter-cultural’
dialogue.310F
‘hybrid’ forms of justice contrast the binary models of retributive
and restorative
The promotion of ‘inter-cultural’ dialogue allows for Indigenous
aims and objectives to be furthered against the backdrop
of ‘criminal
justice apparatus of the Global
North’.312F
justice, achieved through prioritising legitimate deliberation, decentres
colonial legal authority to invoke ‘Indigenous
place-based and
place-centred justice, including’ in the ‘process of generating
these spaces’.313F
Interlegality
describes the ‘porosity’ in legal systems
that makes them amenable to difference and ‘cross-cultural
penetration’.314F
1997, Drummond examined the legal pluralism between Canadian State justice
processes and the laws of Inuit
Proulx has argued that Drummond’s work identifies the means by which
interlegality occurs. This sees communication and dialogue
‘Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal legal systems’ as essential to the
incorporation of ‘distinctive and unfamiliar
[laws and practices] into the
familiar’.316F
Interlegality therefore can be seen as the end result of effective dialogue, and
as such, a product of deliberation. Cunneen has
suggested that where Indigenous
law and dominant non-Indigenous law coalesce ‘a type of postcolonial
hybridity’ may emerge
‘where institutional processes are changed and
the outcome is
an Indigenous process nor the dominant
non-Indigenous legal
process’.317F
Similarly, Blagg and Anthony argue that ISCs ‘carved out’ these
‘hybrid spaces’ within the mainstream sentencing
system.318F
ISCs therefore
have capacity to ‘unsettle non-Indigenous authority in sentencing through
enlivening Indigenous
standpoints’.319F
By achieving hybrid justice, ‘sentencing — as a site of
punishment, rehabilitation and integration’ may be able
to ‘do more
than further objectives of state law and order, and instead augment Indigenous
social orders’.320F
Hybridity between systems may ‘shift the gaze’ from sentencing alone
towards challenging the ‘legal traditions,
discourses and [criminal
justice] processes’ of the Global
Hybridity may also
lead to an emergence of interlegality, whereby the ideas, philosophies and
practices of Aboriginal peoples may
be able to penetrate, and lead to a change
of mainstream justice
systems.322F
opposing systems of law could incorporate ‘each other’s
“socially legitimate sense of limits” and
each other’s sense
of injustice into their justice/legal
spheres’.323F
way, where a legitimate deliberation within a forum results in a hybrid justice
outcome, new ‘spaces for a negotiation
between the laws of the settler
state and Indigenous nations’ may
emerge.324F
This may serve to
‘reinvigorate Indigenous legal and cultural values relating to the
authority of Elders, respect for Indigenous
Knowledges and holistic and
collective responses to individual
needs’.325F
V Conclusion
ISCs were introduced to reduce Indigenous incarceration, provide
opportunities for governments to respond to the Royal Commission
into Aboriginal
Deaths in Custody, and complement various justice agreements between Indigenous
stakeholders and governments. They
offer opportunities to provide inclusive and
reflective sentencing that is culturally appropriate. They have been
characterised as
restorative justice processes — by virtue of their
voluntary nature, focus on accepting responsibility prior to sentencing,
encouragement of open and honest communication — but the restorative
justice framework does not capture the broader goals
of Indigenous peoples with
respect to the justice system. While restorative justice may be able to address
the needs of victims,
it is not equipped as a theory to acknowledge or promote
the broader aims of ISCs and ‘cultural and political transformation
law’ as sought by Indigenous
peoples.326F
Restorative
justice framing deprioritises
these aims, and favours settler-colonial
evaluative measures such as rates of recidivism and deterrence. As a result, ISC
are unfairly evaluated against narrow measures leading to the closure
of ISC programs in some jurisdictions, and Indigeneity being
viewed through a
lens of risk.
While ISCs are by no means ideal examples of deliberative democracy, the
theory provides an alternative evaluative framework by which
we can examine the
laws governing ISCs: namely, Dryzek’s hallmarks of deliberative capacity
(inclusivity, authenticity and
consequentiality).327F
can be used to assess the legitimacy of the deliberation afforded to Elders and
Respected Persons who play an integral role
within ISCs.
When inclusivity is used as a criterion for evaluating ISCs, it becomes clear
that there are some shortcomings with regards to both
inclusive language and
cultural practices. There is a clear and important need to facilitate Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander
languages in the court process in order to achieve
inclusive deliberation. By working towards greater incorporation of Indigenous
languages and laws within ISCs, both the deliberative hallmarks of inclusivity
and consequentiality could be strengthened leading
to a more legitimate
deliberative forum. The laws governing ISCs constrain authentic deliberation by
coercing Elders and Respected
Persons through prescribing the content and
application of such
deliberation.328F
limit what can be deliberated and how those deliberations are given effect. They
govern the role of judicial officers
overseeing the ISCs.
Furthermore, by examining the extent to which ISCs enable consequential
deliberation by Indigenous participants, it is possible to
evaluate whether such
Indigenous communities are empowered within this process. Constitutional issues
limit the extent to which judicial
power can be delegated to Elders or Respected
Persons.329F
Where Elders and
Respected Persons are not provided with the power to shape outcomes, community
confidence in the system may wane.
It has been noted that the presence of Elders
and Respected Persons has led to the defendant having a greater understanding
greater amenability towards, the overall sentencing
process.330F
Deliberative democracy may provide a pathway towards addressing power
imbalances between Indigenous law and dominant non-Indigenous
law, leading to a
more nuanced discussion about how such imbalances may be addressed at a
structural level. Strengthening deliberation
using Dryzek’s three
hallmarks may shape law through the development of forms of hybrid justice and
interlegality between Indigenous
legal systems and dominant non-Indigenous
systems.331F
By achieving
hybridity through deliberative democracy the legal hegemony of the Global North
may be challenged.332F
ideas, philosophies and practices of Aboriginal peoples may be able to penetrate
the dominant non-Indigenous legal system resulting
in change to mainstream
justice systems and a degree of
commensurability.333F
legitimisation of deliberation in ISCs may facilitate negotiation between legal
systems in which hybrid forms of justice may
emerge and where Indigenous
disadvantage within the justice system may be
addressed.334F
If pursued,
these ideals may see a coalescence of Indigenous and dominant non-Indigenous
laws, where both legal systems are able
to mutually inform and understand the
values of the other.
