[1] This is an
application by the respondent seeking leave to file amended Reasons for Refusal
in an appeal against the respondent’s
decision to refuse a development
application to expand an established quarry at Oxenford.
development application was lodged on 21 May 2019. It was refused, resulting in
the notice of appeal being filed on 26 November
respondent’s Reasons for Refusal were filed on 28 March 2022, and these
were identified as part of the issues in dispute
in the appeal pursuant to the
order of Kefford DCJ on 5 August 2022. They included allegations concerning the
impact of the proposed
development on ecological values mapped pursuant to the
respondent’s planning scheme (version 6) which was in effect when the
development application was properly made on 21 May 2019. Since that time, the
mapping has been reviewed and changed. Version 10
of the planning scheme took
effect on 4 July 2023, and in the amended Reasons for Refusal the subject of
this application, the respondent
seeks to add issues arising from Vegetation
Overlay Map 8, which now applies to the land the subject of the proposed
development.

application of this type,
Planning and Environment Court Act
is a good place to start. It states:
(1) In conducting P&E Court proceedings and applying the rules, the P&E
Court must—
(a) facilitate the just and expeditious resolution of the issues; and
(b) avoid undue delay, expense and technicality.
Hartnett v Hynes
[2009] QSC 225
, Applegarth J outlined 12
principles to apply with respect to applications involving amendments which seek
to raise new issues.
These were approved by the Court of Appeal in
Coal 2 Pty Ltd v Sanrus Pty Ltd
[2014] QCA 267
, with the observation
by Flanagan J that they are only a guide and each case will depend on its own
circumstances.
[7] Relevant
considerations before me are primarily the delay in seeking to raise the new
issue and the explanation for it, and the
prejudice the appellant asserts it
will suffer as a consequence. Notably, Applegarth J observed in his list of
principles:
Even when an amendment does not lead to the adjournment
of a trial or the vacation of fixed trial dates, a party that has had sufficient
opportunity to plead their case may be denied leave to amend for the sake of
doing justice to the other parties and to achieve the
objective of the just and
expeditious resolution of the real issues in dispute at a minimum of
[8] Essentially,
the respondent argues that: it is in the interests of justice that the court
have regard to the most up to date mapping
in hearing and determining the
appeal; the appellant will not suffer any real prejudice should the issue be
added; and that it has
explained how the failure to previously raise the amended
mapping occurred. The respondent emphasises that the relevant experts
yet commenced their joint meetings and that dates for the hearing of the appeal
have not yet been set. The respondent concedes,
however, that ecological
impacts of the proposed development, aside from the precise categorisation of
the site pursuant to the latest
mapping, have always been and remain in
Connor, the applicant’s solicitor, points out, despite the change to the
mapping giving rise to this application being
known to the respondent since at
least November 2019, the first time the respondent raised the issue in this
appeal was when it served
this application on the appellant after it was filed
on 12 February 2025. At first glance, this appears an unacceptable delay.
respondent seeks to explain it as an oversight on the part of both the
respondent’s officers and legal representatives.
The explanation
concerning the former is lacking in substance and based on information and
belief in an affidavit sworn by the solicitor
who has the carriage of the
matter. In my view, there is unacceptable delay in raising the issue and an
unsatisfactory explanation
appellant asserts it will also suffer prejudice should the application be
allowed. Because of the delay, it asserts that
it has lost the right to make a
request to apply the superseded planning scheme to the proposed development and
have it either assessed
without the changed mapping, or trigger a right to
compensation pursuant to
of the PA. The respondent is dismissive of this
[11] The fact
remains however that, if the change to the mapping giving rise to the
application is of significance to the eventual
outcome of the appeal, the
appellant has clearly suffered significant potential prejudice. On the other
hand, if the change to the
mapping is not of significance to the eventual
outcome of the appeal (and I note that the changed mapping only something that
court can give the weight it considers appropriate to pursuant to
then the delay in raising the issue and the absence of a satisfactory
explanation for it weighs against the addition of such a peripheral
issue. This
is particularly so where the ecological values of the site are already in issue
in the appeal.
[12] Either way,
in the exercise of my discretion I refuse the application.
