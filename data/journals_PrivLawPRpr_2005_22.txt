Workplace Surveillance in NSW to be regulated from October
Workplace Surveillance Act
will commence on 7 October. Earlier
plans to phase in commencement have been abandoned as likely to confuse. The
most immediate
effect is that notice will have to be given to employees 14 days
prior to the commencement date for surveillance to qualify as overt,
therefore not require a magistrate’s warrant (it must also meet the other
conditions in the Act).

ACMA due to finalise binding Standard on Telephone Directory
The long drawn out issue of regulation of telephone directory data is about
to be partially resolved. In May, the Australian Communications
Authority (now
ACMA) issued a draft Industry Standard on the Integrated Number Data Base
(IPND). When finally issued later this
year, the Standard will regulate the use
of data in and derived from the IPND, which is currently compiled by Telstra as
the contracted
IPND Manager. This will however result in an uneven playing
field in that Telstra’s Sensis Directories which are sourced directly
carriers will not be subject to the Standard, leaving competitor directory
publishers at a disadvantage. ACMA has cited jurisdictional
limits on its
ability to achieve a more comprehensive solution through a Standard, but it is
clear that other complementary regulatory
action will be required.

Identity Cards and Surveillance cameras on the agenda
Remarks by Queensland Premier Peter Beatty in July set off a flurry of
speculation about the possible introduction of a national identity
federal government appeared to encourage debate without providing any clear
indication of its view, and as a result even
coalition Ministers gave very
different reactions. It seems an ID card, along with greater use of
surveillance cameras, will be
on the agenda for the summit of federal and state
premiers expected to be held in late August.
For a critical perspective on the ID card issue, but also a comprehensive set
of factual resources, see

Federal Commissioner’s workload stabilises
End of financial year figures from the OFPC show that complaints received at
1275 were almost identical to 2003-04 (1276), while telephone

European Commission to prosecute Germany for inadequate data protection
On July 5th, the European Commission wrote to the German Federal Government
informing them that it would begin legal proceedings
in the European Court of
Justice against Germany.
Although this letter has not yet been published, Privacy Laws & Business
has learned from Dr. Alexander Dix, Berlin’s Data
Protection and Freedom
of Information Commissioner that the basis of the proceedings is the European
Commission’s view that
the 16 Land (state) Data Protection Commissioners
lack the independent status required by Art. 28.1 of the EU Data Protection
This article states that these supervisory authorities “shall
act with complete independence in exercising the functions entrusted
