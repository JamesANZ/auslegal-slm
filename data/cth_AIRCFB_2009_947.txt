MELBOURNE, 24 DECEMBER 2009
This decision concerns an application made by
REI Super under
section 576H
Workplace Relations Act 1996
to vary the
Private Sector Award 2010
(Modern Clerks Award) to include REI Super as a default fund listed in cl.24.4 of the award.
REI Super submitted they are currently a named fund in two Notional Agreements Preserving State Awards (NAPSAs) which cover clerical
employees working in the real estate industry, one NAPSA arising from the
Real Estate Industry (Clerical and Administrative) (State) Award
in New South Wales and another NAPSA arising from the
Estate Agents Award
in Tasmania.
REI Super submitted that if the provisional view of the Full Bench was confirmed and clerical employees in the real estate industry
are to be covered by the Modern Clerks Award, their inclusion as a default fund in relevant award based-transitional instruments
supports their inclusion as a named default fund in the Modern Clerks Award.
No submissions were filed in opposition to the application.
We have decided to grant the application, consistent with our inclusion of funds which have been named in relevant pre-reform awards
and NAPSAs in other modern awards. An order will be issued accordingly.
