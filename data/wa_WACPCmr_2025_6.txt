The landlord is responsible for

Reasons for
As a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the
evidence relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for
Are the premises unsuitable for keeping the pet?
The tenant advised the requested pet is a therapy dog [redacted] [redacted], and
will not be kept at the premises permanently, but
instead on a rotation basis
[redacted]. The tenant states the requested pet has a calm demeanour, is used to
[redacted] [redacted]
and would remain indoors most of the time. The tenant
states the requested pet is trained to avoid an electric fence.
The premises is a two-story house with [redacted], situated on a [redacted]
farm. The surrounding farmland and [redacted] units near
the premises are rented
out to other tenants. Some of the fencing in the surrounding farmland is
electric fencing.
The landlord is concerned that the requested pet will interfere with the
[redacted] kept on the farmland surrounding the premises.
The landlord is
concerned the requested pet will chase [redacted] and either lead them onto
[redacted] high-speed road (causing a
traffic accident) or into the dam (leading
to drowning or injury).
The RTA provides examples of why a premises may be unsuitable, such as lack of
fencing and open spaces.
Images of the premises provided by both parties show the outside area at the
front of the premises is not fenced.
The premises has a back yard which has inadequate fencing. Images provided by
the landlord show the fencing is low waist height in
some areas. There is a
visible gap between two fencing panels, which the requested pet could squeeze
through. In some areas the fencing
panels are tied together with what appears to
be a rope, in an insecure manner.
The fencing is insecure and does not prevent the requested pet from roaming into
the [redacted], the dam, the [redacted] road, or
other premises nearby. Having
regard to all the evidence before me, I am satisfied the premises are unsuitable
for keeping the requested
