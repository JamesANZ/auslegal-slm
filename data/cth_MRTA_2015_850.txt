STATEMENT OF DECISION AND REASONS
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
is an application for review of a decision made by a delegate of the Minister
for Immigration on 21 January 2015 to refuse to
grant the applicant a Skilled -
Independent (Permanent) (Class SI) (Subclass 189) (Skilled – Independent)
Migration Act 1958
(the Act). This visa is
designed for skilled applicants who have submitted an expression of interest and
received an invitation to
apply for the visa.
applicant was invited to apply for the visa on 29 August 2014 and applied for
the visa on 8 September 2014 nominating the skilled
occupation of Mechanical
criteria for the grant of a Subclass 189 visa are set out in
Schedule 2 to the
Migration Regulations 1994
(the Regulations). The delegate
refused to grant the visa because the applicant did not satisfy
cl.189.212(1)(a), which required
that at the time that he was invited to apply
for the visa, the relevant assessing authority for the applicant’s
occupation had assessed his skills as suitable for that occupation.
The delegate noted that the applicant had stated in his online
visa application
that his skills had been assessed on 1 October 2012 by Engineers Australia as
suitable but when asked to provide
the skills assessment, the applicant provided
a positive skills assessment from Engineers Australia issued to him on 4
December 2014.
As this document indicated that the applicant had applied for
the skills assessment on 21 November 2014, he did not meet
cl.189.212(1)(a).
Tribunal received a review application from the applicant on 21 January 2015.
It was accompanied by a copy of the delegate’s
decision and a submission
from the applicant, in which he explained that he had been a Chartered Engineer
since 2012 and that the
assessment to be recognised as such was as detailed, if
not more so, than the Engineers Australia skills assessment. Therefore,
put down these details in good faith as he believed his skills had already been
assessed as suitable as a Mechanical Engineer.
applicant appeared before the Tribunal by conference telephone on 2 June
2015 to give evidence and present arguments.
the hearing, the Tribunal sent an email to Engineers Australia for clarification
and received a response dated 10 June 2015.
The contents are discussed
the following reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the matter should be
remitted for reconsideration.
CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE
issue in the present case is whether the applicant meets
cl.189.212(1).
Suitable Skills Assessment
189.212(1) requires that at the time of invitation to apply for the visa, the
relevant assessing authority had assessed the
applicant’s skills as
suitable for the applicant’s nominated skilled occupation. For visa
applications where the invitation
to apply was given on or after 28 October
2013, this assessment cannot be one for a Subclass 485 (Temporary Graduate)
visa. For visa
applications made on or after 1 July 2014, there are additional
requirements relating to the currency of the assessment as at the
invitation to apply for the visa.
assessing authority’ means a person or body specified by the Minister in
an instrument under r.2.26B of the
Regulations (r.1.03). ‘Skilled
occupation’ has the meaning given by r.1.15I of the Regulations (r.1.03).
An occupation
is a skilled occupation if: it is specified by the Minister in an
instrument in writing as a skilled occupation; and, if a number
of points are
specified in the instrument as being available — for which the number of
points are available; and that is applicable
to the person in accordance with
the specification of the occupation. The relevant instrument for these purposes
is Legislative Instrument
IMMI 14/048. This provides that the occupation of
Mechanical Engineer is a skilled occupation for these purposes, and that the
assessing authority is Engineers Australia.
the assessment was made on the basis of a qualification obtained in Australia
while the applicant held a student visa, the qualification
must have been
obtained as a result of studying a registered course: cl.189.212(2).
‘Registered course’ is defined to
mean a course of education or
training provided by an institution, body or person that is registered, under
Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000
, to provide the
course to overseas students (r.1.03).
this case, it was not disputed that the applicant had a positive skills
assessment from Engineers Australia as a Mechanical Engineer
that he applied for
on 21 November 2014 and that was issued to him on 4 December 2014. Nor was it
disputed that he applied for this
skills assessment after he was invited to
apply for the subclass 189 visa on 29 August 2014.
applicant’s argument was that Engineers Australia had previously assessed
him in 2012 for the purposes of recognising him
as a Chartered Engineer (in the
field of Mechanical Engineering), as a result of which he was issued with a
membership card by Engineers
Australia in October 2012 stating that he was a
Chartered Engineer, whose college was Mechanical Engineering. The card number
the skills assessment reference he put in his visa application form. He
submitted that this assessment should be taken to be a skills
assessment for the
purposes of his subclass 189 visa application, as it was at least as rigorous an
assessment as the one Engineers
Australia undertook when it issued him a skills
assessment on 4 December 2014.
Tribunal indicated to the applicant that it intended to formally request
Engineers Australia to clarify whether the earlier assessment
to recognise the
applicant as a Chartered Engineer could be regarded as a skills assessment for
the occupation for the purposes of
a subclass 189 migration application.
Following the hearing, the Tribunal wrote to Engineers Australia giving the
background to
the applicant’s case and seeking the following
information:
clarification of
the process by which the applicant was issued with the membership card 4215447
recognising that he was a Chartered
Engineer in the area of Mechanical
Engineering – in particular, the date and details of the assessment that
was undertaken;
Engineers Australia would regard the assessment as equivalent, or superior to,
the assessment process undertaken in November
– December 2014 to assess
his skills as suitable for the occupation of Mechanical Engineer.
10 June 2015, the Tribunal received a response from the Lead Migration Skills
Assessor of Engineers Australia, as follows:
In response to your enquiry we can advise:
[the applicant] was elected as a Chartered Professional Engineer which includes
membership of the Mechanical College on 6 November
2012 through the Mutual
Recognition Agreement signed between Engineers Australia and Engineers Canada
(please see the attached for
more details). [The applicant] made a request to
this office on 21 November 2014 to seek a MSA [Migration Skills Assessment]
Considering his Chartered Professional Engineer status, full membership
of the Mechanical College and after examining his membership
file, we found all
his information meet our MSA guidelines and a positive MSA outcome letter was
thus granted on 4 December 2014.
Our MSA process adopts the same engineering competency standards as Engineers
Australia membership’s Stage 1 competency. To
be recognised as a
Chartered Professional Engineer, the candidate must meet the Stage 1 competency
standard plus the candidate must
be able to demonstrate an additional 16
engineering elements in four units and attend a technical interview
to this response was a scanned copy of a letter dated 6 November 2012 from
Engineers Australia to the applicant confirming
his election to the grade of
Member and Chartered Professional Engineer, which included membership of the
Mechanical College in the
equivalent grade, effective 6 November 2012, and that
membership in this Grade, with Chartered Status entitled him to use the
postnominals
of MIEAust CP Eng.
Tribunal has considered the information provided by Engineers Australia
carefully. It notes that neither the Act nor Regulations
define ‘skills
assessment’ or ‘suitable skills assessment’ because the
legislation in this area specifically
confers the responsibility (and the
standards for) skills assessments on the relevant assessing authority.
the particular circumstances of this case, the Tribunal is satisfied that
Engineers Australia has confirmed that the skills assessment
it undertook in
late 2012 to recognise the applicant as a Chartered Engineer in the field of
Mechanical Engineering in Australia
is a skills assessment equivalent to (and in
fact more rigorous than) the one it issued to him on 4 December 2014 recognising
skills as suitable for the occupation of Mechanical Engineer. It is
satisfied that the relevant assessing authority, Engineers Australia,
the applicant’s skills as suitable for his nominated occupation of
Mechanical Engineering on 6 November 2012. The
Tribunal is therefore satisfied
that cl.189.212(1)(a) is met.
Furthermore,
the Tribunal is satisfied that the skills assessment of 6 November 2012 was not
issued for the purposes of a subclass
485 visa application, that it was not made
on the basis of qualification obtained by the applicant in Australia, that there
period of validity expressed in this assessment and that this assessment
was issued to the applicant less than 3 years before he
was invited to apply for
the subclass 189 visa on 29 August 2014.
Tribunal is therefore satisfied that cl.189.212(1)(b) and (d) are satisfied, and
that cl.189.212(1)(c) does not apply in this
the applicant was not relying upon Australian qualifications in order to obtain
his skills assessment, the Tribunal is satisfied
that cl.189.212(2) does not
apply in this case.
the basis of these findings, the Tribunal finds that the applicant satisfies
cl.189.212 as a whole.
the findings above, the appropriate course is to remit the visa application to
the Minister to consider the remaining criteria.
Tribunal remits the application for a Skilled - Independent (Permanent) (Class
SI) visa for reconsideration, with the direction
that the applicant meets the
following criteria for a Subclass 189 visa:
cl.189.212 of
Schedule 2 to the Regulations.
