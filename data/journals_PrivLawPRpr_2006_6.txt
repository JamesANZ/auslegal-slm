Stewart, Blair --- "Privacy Commissioners Adopt Ambitious Regional Objectives" [2006] PrivLawPRpr 6; (2006) 11(8) Privacy Law and Policy Reporter 221
Blair Stewart
In Melbourne in November the privacy authorities from Australia, New Zealand,
Hong Kong, New South Wales, Victoria, Northern Territory
and Korea adopted a new
name for their forum. The Melbourne meeting, the 24th in a series tracing back
14 years, had been known as
the Privacy Agencies of New Zealand and Australia
plus Hong Kong and Korea (PANZA+). The meeting brings together those data
authorities accredited to the International Conference of Privacy and
Data Protection Commissioners that are based in Asia and the
Western Pacific.
From now on, the meeting is to be known as Asia Pacific Privacy Authorities
Forum (APPA Forum).
The adoption of a new name is not merely a re-branding exercise. The
participants also adopted a Statement of Objectives. The Statement
explains why
PANZA+ foundations and enhance
arrangements in order to facilitate knowledge sharing, foster cooperation,
promote best practice and
improve each privacy authority’s
performance.
The Statement of Objectives reflect a genuine wish by privacy commissioners
to seek out those areas where an enhanced regional dimension
may improve their
work domestically. An example is the adoption of a common standard on case note
citation that should cement cooperative
steps earlier taken (with the assistance
and encouragement of
editor, Graham Greenleaf).
Commissioners have also initiated teleconferences to enhance communications
between meetings and agreed
to explore “webinars” as a low-cost
means to share knowledge. Plans are afoot to enhance links between specialised
in the various offices with the first network to be set up involving
education managers.
