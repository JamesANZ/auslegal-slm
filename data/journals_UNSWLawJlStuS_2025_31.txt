BEYOND DECRIMINALISATION AND TOWARDS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE:
AN INTERSECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF HOW LEGAL FRAMEWORKS SHAPE ABORTION ACCESS
AUSTRALIA AND INDIA
STELLA WAILES
I INTRODUCTION
Access to safe and legal abortion remains an ongoing battle for women
globally. In both Australia and India, abortion is permitted
under specific
circumstances. However, access to abortion services remains profoundly unequal
and heavily influenced by social, cultural,
and legal factors. The theory of
‘reproductive justice’ illustrates that while legal protections for
abortion are crucial,
it does not necessarily guarantee access to abortion or
complete reproductive autonomy, especially for
most impacted by
institutional structures of racism, sexism, colonialism, and economic
inequality.
This article will critically evaluate the legislative framework surrounding
abortion in Australia and India, focusing on how these
frameworks influence
access to abortion. It will also explore the broader effects of race, class,
geography, colonial legacies, and,
in the Indian context, how caste and religion
shape reproductive autonomy. This article will begin by briefly outlining the
of reproductive justice, followed by an overview of the legal frameworks
regulating abortion in Australia and India. It will then
examine the structural
barriers to abortion in both countries. The final section argues that, despite
differing legal frameworks,
socio-legal contexts, and development levels, both
Australia and India demonstrate, in unique ways, the necessity for
decriminalisation
alongside structural reforms to achieve genuine, equal, and
lasting access to reproductive healthcare.
II REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE: AN INTERSECTIONAL THEORY
The theory of reproductive justice provides a framework to examine legal and
practical access to abortion in the Australian and Indian
contexts. Reproductive
justice was first articulated by twelve Black women working within the 1990s
reproductive rights movement
in the United
As Loretta Ross, a founder
of the movement, suggests, in its simplest form, reproductive justice splices
together reproductive rights
Reproductive justice
consists of three interconnected pillars: ‘(1) the right to have a child
under the conditions of one’s
choosing; (2) the right not to have a child
using birth control, abortion or abstinence; and (3) the right to parent
children in
safe and healthy environments free from violence from individuals or
the state’.
The feminists who ‘conceptualised, birthed, and propagated’ this
theory recognised that legal advocacy for abortion rights
alone was inadequate
to address the intersecting oppressions faced by Black women under white
supremacy, misogyny, and
neoliberalism.
Reproductive justice
complicates the pro-choice/pro-life binary, moving beyond abortion as the sole
reproductive issue for feminist
organising.
Reproductive justice
advocates for the full range of reproductive health services, including access
to contraceptives, prenatal and
postnatal care, infertility, maternal mortality,
sexually transmitted diseases and intimate partner
As an ‘original
intersectional theory’, reproductive justice sheds light on how
interconnected structural oppressions
shape the material realities of
women’s access to reproductive
healthcare.
III THE AUSTRALIAN ABORTION FRAMEWORK: A WAVE OF
DECRIMINALISATION
Over the past two decades, abortion legislation in Australia has undergone a
significant transformation, shifting from a criminal
law issue to a public
health concern.
Abortion in
Australia is regulated at the state and territory level. Historically, abortion

V A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE APPROACH: ABORTION ACCESS IN
As Galloway and McGrath suggest, ‘merely enacting reproductive rights
– and thus formal equality ... is not, however,
sufficient to achieve
reproductive justice’.
While the previous sections have examined the legal framework of abortion in
Australia and India, it is also vital to consider the
practical effects of the
law and how this interacts with the reality of abortion access on the ground. A
reproductive justice approach
facilitates an examination of abortion regulation
that is cognisant of power relations and the intersectionality of
individuals’
identities.
In the Australian
context, an intersectional analysis must account for how gender, race, class,
culture, and the ongoing impacts
of colonialism affect access to abortion care.
Despite the decriminalisation of abortion across Australia, access continues
to be inconsistent and inherently unequal. A 2023 Senate
inquiry into universal
access to reproductive healthcare characterised abortion access in Australia as
a ‘postcode lottery’
in which where a person lives determines the
availability, quality, and cost of reproductive healthcare

report identified numerous barriers to accessing reproductive healthcare,

medical practitioners qualified to provide surgical
or medical abortions,
inconsistent regulations across jurisdictions, and conscientious objection
provisions.
A Geographies of Abortion Access: The Rural and
Metropolitan Divide
A major barrier to abortion access in Australia is the limited availability
of abortion services, especially in remote and rural areas.
As noted by the
Senate Inquiry, although surgical terminations are legal across Australia, many
public hospitals do not provide abortion
services or provide them on a limited

people living in abortion deserts are forced to travel long distances, endure
extended wait times, and bear additional travel
and accommodation expenses to
access abortion facilities.
Disparities in abortion access for rural and metropolitan women are further
exacerbated by the limited number of general practitioners

B The Cost of Access
Even with broad decriminalisation, the Inquiry highlighted how consistently
high costs continue to pose a significant obstacle to
abortion access. Due to
limited abortion services in public hospitals, most abortions are obtained
through GPs or private clinics,

significantly higher for individuals ineligible for Medicare, such as migrants
on temporary visas and international
From a reproductive
justice perspective, these financial barriers disproportionately affect women
from low socio-economic backgrounds,
particularly rural and First Nations women,
often rendering abortion services inaccessible.
C Legislative Obstacles
Aspects of the legislative framework, such as the conscientious objector
exception, also impede access to abortion. As Casey et al
suggest, the capacity
of healthcare professionals to conscientiously object can result in a shortage
of abortion providers and longer
An estimated 14% of
obstetricians and gynaecologists are entirely opposed to

limits across jurisdictions. These inconsistencies create

obligations.
In 2018, the United
Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended
that Australia harmonise its
state and territory legislation on abortion
‘to guarantee access to legal and prescribed abortion
Submissions to
the recent Senate Inquiry echoed this recommendation, highlighting how
legislative inconsistency fuels the ‘postcode
lottery’ of abortion
access and urging national
harmonisation.
D Reproductive Justice and First Nations Women
Within Australia’s settler-colonial context, abortion access for First
Nations women cannot be considered in isolation from
the ongoing impacts of
colonialism. Abortion rhetoric in Australia has long been imbued with
‘racialised discourse’ and
the white nationalist
At the same time as
second-wave feminists sought the right not to have children, advocating for
access to contraceptives and abortions,
First Nations women ‘were losing
their right to be
As Reade notes,
the demands of white feminists for liberal abortion rights received little
support from First Nations women whose
lived experiences of rape, involuntary
sterilisation, forced terminations, and the ‘systematic breaking up of
their families
since white invasion’ were excluded from feminist discourse
on reproduction rights.
First Nations women face the same geographic, economic, and legislative
barriers to accessing abortion outlined earlier, but often
to an even greater
extent. They also encounter distinct forms of ‘reproductive
oppression’, including the ongoing removal
of children, significantly
higher rates of maternal mortality, and denial of culturally appropriate
reproductive health services.
Reproductive justice for First Nations women involves more than just access to
abortions; it requires the ability to have and raise
children in safe and
healthy environments, free from state violence and colonial

VI JUSTICE APPROACH: ABORTION ACCESS IN INDIA
A reproductive justice approach provides a comprehensive intersectional
framework that can examine not only how legal frameworks influence
abortion in Australia - especially for rural, migrant, and First Nations women
– but also how caste, religion, and
socioeconomic inequality hinder access
to abortion for marginalised women in India. Despite being constitutionally
prohibited, caste

VII TOWARDS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FUTURES
A comparative analysis of the interplay between the legal frameworks and
abortion access in Australia and India offers important insights
for advancing
reproductive justice. The Indian case underscores the necessity for
decriminalisation in a culturally sensitive manner.
On the other hand, the
Australian experience demonstrates that although decriminalisation is crucial,
it is not enough by itself
to guarantee abortion access. In both countries,
achieving genuinely equitable access to abortion requires that decriminalisation
be accompanied by broader measures that address systemic barriers and account
for women’s intersectional identities and lived
experiences.
A The Indian Case: A Need for Decriminalisation
In India, while abortion is legally available under specific circumstances,
there remains a critical need for decriminalisation. As
Jain suggests, within a
reproductive justice framework, abortion cannot be regulated through
‘carceral policies’ that
disproportionately and acutely affect
marginalised women.

An essential cultural consideration for any decriminalisation of abortion in
India is the prevention of sex-selective abortions of
female fetuses. As legal
scholar Tella suggests, it is necessary to address the crucial question:

B The Australian Case: Beyond Decriminalisation
In contrast to India, the Australian case demonstrates that while
decriminalisation is a vital step, it alone does not ensure equitable
genuine access to abortion services. The Australian case underscores the need
for reproductive justice frameworks that go beyond
legal reform and also address
the ‘institutional forces of racism, sexism, and colonialism’ that
influence women’s

– intersect to shape and limit abortion access. While the Indian case
