applicants seek special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Meagher
and Kirk JJA,
Griffiths A‑JA), dismissing the applicants' appeal from a decision of
the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Nixon
J). That decision, relevantly,
rejected the applicants' claim that a commercial lease, in respect of which the
applicants had been
guarantors of the tenant's obligations, had been frustrated
and that, as a result, the applicants were not liable for unpaid rent
amounts under the lease.
application does not raise a question of law of public importance sufficient to
warrant the grant of special leave to appeal.
Further, the proposed appeal has
insufficient prospects of success to make it in the interests of the
administration of justice to
grant special leave.
leave to appeal is refused with costs.
