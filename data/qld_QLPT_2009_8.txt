(1893) 6 R 67
ss 8, 12(3)
Trust Accounts Act
Mr B I McMillan for applicant
Mr B W Farr SC for respondent
SOLICITORS:
Legal Services Commission for applicant
Brian Bartley & Associates for respondent
[1] By this Discipline Application, the respondent, a solicitor, confronts
five charges. All are admitted; and the respondent accepts
that he is guilty of
professional misconduct.
[2] One charge involves neglect in the conduct of
a case in court. The other four arise from the respondent’s failure to
his trust account consistently with legal and professional obligations.
Importantly, there is no allegation that he dealt dishonestly
with trust funds
or that his misconduct reflects on his fitness to practise. The Legal Services
Commissioner (“the Commissioner”)
accepts that the
respondent’s misconduct in respect of the trust account was caused by
inadequate office procedures.
Burmingham Complaint
[3] The first charge
concerns a failure to act promptly on a client’s instructions to transfer
money held in the trust account.
[4] In May 2004, Mr Burmingham retained the
respondent to hold $1,000,000 in his trust account. The client was involved in
with his previous legal advisers over $200,000 claimed by them for
professional fees.
[5] The $1,000,000 was transferred to the trust account
in July 2004.
[6] In December 2005, Mr Burmingham made a written demand for
payment to him of $10,000 out of the money held in trust on his behalf.
instruction was not complied with within 14 days of receipt of the demand,
contrary to
Trust Accounts Act 1973
(“the Act”). The
money was not transferred until mid-January 2006.
[7] On 21 December 2005, Mr
Burmingham, in writing, insisted on the immediate transfer of all funds in the
trust account in excess
of the disputed $200,000. That was not done until early
February 2006.
Darvall Complaints
[8] Charge 3 concerns payments out of
the trust account without appropriate authority, contrary to
[9] In early 2003, the respondent received instructions from Mr Charles,
a director of Kensea Pty Ltd (“Kensea”), and
Mr Darvall, an
“authorised representative” of that company, to act for it in
connection with the sale of Kensea’s
[10] In May 2003, the
Australian Government Solicitor, representing the Child Support Registrar,
informed the respondent of a court
order restraining Mr Darvall and Kensea from
dealing with Kensea’s business without the Registrar’s consent and
the Registrar had consented to sale of the business on the basis that the
price was to be held in the respondent’s trust account
until the Registrar
agreed to distribution of the money.
[11] A few days later, the Registrar
consented to distributions to the Australian Taxation Office and to those of
Kensea’s trade
creditors named in a list. That list did not include the
respondent.
[12] In early June, Mr Darvall wrote to the respondent telling
him that as “Kensea is under a Court order to only pay out the
listed on the letter...we will need a bill for your agreed costs so that I can
get authority to pay.”
[13] The respondent had previously acted for
Kensea in other matters and was owed $3,306.11 for professional services. On 6
2003, he transferred that sum to his general account for those services
rendered. However, he did not have an authority to do so
of the kind envisaged
of the Act.
[14] The fourth charge relates to payment out of the trust
account of moneys mentioned in a tax invoice issued by the respondent to
This included $1,250 for his professional fees, $825 for Counsel’s fees,
and $96.80 for outlays.
[15] On 17 June 2003, the respondent withdrew the
$825 from his trust account, without authority to do so, and paid the barrister.
[16] The fifth charge relates to the withdrawal on 20 June 2003 of $1,375
from the trust account, which was paid to the general account
respondent’s professional fees.
[17] The $3,306.11 and the $825 have
since been refunded to the trust account.
[18] Another charge
arises out of a complaint by Mr Dryland, who, in July 2004, retained the
respondent to resist an application for
an apprehended violence order.
[19] Mr Dryland’s case involved a denial of the incident of violence
alleged against him.
[20] During the hearing, the respondent, who acted as
advocate, failed to put his client’s case when cross-examining.
[21] The Court made an apprehended violence order against Mr Dryland.
[22] It is not alleged that there was a connection between a failure to
comply with the rule of practice in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6
R 67 and the outcome
of the hearing. Rather, the undisputed case is merely that there was a failure
to cross-examine appropriately.
Professional Misconduct
[23] Considered
in its entirety, the respondent’s conduct rises to the level of
professional misconduct.
Practice Management
[24] Mr Peter Lynch provides
practice management advice to Queensland law firms. He has guided the
respondent since December 2006.
His consultancy services included
recommendations on practice effectiveness and for managing client
expectations.
[25] In Mr Lynch’s assessment, the difficulties Mr Dwyer
encountered when the misconduct took place were attributable to the
solicitor’s decision to act in a high proportion of legally assisted
criminal and family matters where client communication
and file management
challenges are substantial.
[26] Mr Lynch has seen improvements in Mr
Dwyer’s practice management. Files are better organised. There is weekly
trust balancing.
Billing practices have improved.
[27] Mr Dwyer has agreed
to cooperate with Mr Lynch in a coaching program, at the end of which a report
is to be supplied to the Commissioner.
This would involve a commitment from Mr
Lynch of about 3-4 hours per month over six months, at an estimated cost of
$6,000-$8,000.
[28] Mr Lynch has also given persuasive reasons for thinking
that the program he proposes would, in this instance, be preferable to
Queensland Law Society Practice Management Course.
[29] The Commissioner
submits that the Tribunal would consider it appropriate that the respondent
engage Mr Lynch to provide the practice
management services proposed. And Mr
Lynch’s evidence justifies that approach.
[30] The Commissioner also
contends that while, ordinarily, a substantial fine would be appropriate for the
kind of misconduct proved,
in view of the expense the respondent will incur with
Mr Lynch over the next six months, a pecuniary penalty is not
[31] The Commissioner proposes, the respondent accepts, and the
Tribunal is persuaded that the following orders are appropriate:
Respondent:
1. is publicly reprimanded;
2. is to engage Mr Peter Lynch to provide a six
month practice management coaching program and thereafter to provide a report to
Legal Services Commissioner confirming the respondent’s participation
in the training required under that program; and
3. is to pay the
applicant’s costs fixed at $2,500.
