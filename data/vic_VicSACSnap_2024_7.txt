Sentencing Snapshot 291: Sentencing Trends for Trafficking in a Commercial

of Victoria (the higher courts)
from 2018-19 to

carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment and/or

If the offence
was committed on or after 20 March 2017, it is a category 2 offence, meaning
courts must impose a custodial sentence
except in particular
circumstances.

drugs was the principal offence, that is, cases where
trafficking in a

Trafficking in a commercial quantity of drugs was the principal offence in
2.8% of cases sentenced in the higher courts between 2018-19
and 2022-23.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 243 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of trafficking in a commercial
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
trafficking in a commercial quantity of drugs by financial

The number of people sentenced

Sentence types and trends
Figure 2 shows the proportion of people who received
an immediate custodial sentence or non-custodial sentence for the principal

sentence involves at least some element of immediate imprisonment

immediate custodial sentences was lowest in 2022-23 (91.8%) and highest in
2019-20 and 2020-21 (100.0%). Over the five-year
period, 95.9% of people were

The following sections analyse the use of

from 2018-19 to 2022-23.
The principal sentence describes sentences for the offence at

multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the same as or
longer than the principal

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 233 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for the principal
offence of trafficking in a commercial quantity of drugs, 222
were eligible to
have a non-parole period
