ADMINISTRATION
the administration order made by the Tribunal on 9 April 2009 is changed by
removing BJ and WA as administrators and appointing
The Public Trustee of
Queensland as administrator for MAG for all financial matters.
administrator is to provide a financial management plan to the Tribunal within
four (4) months.
Tribunal directs the administrator to provide accounts to the Tribunal when
appointment remains current until further order of the Tribunal.
REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION
[1] MAG is the adult. He is 39 years of age. He lives in rural South East
Queensland, in a supported accommodation facility.
[2] A previous order was made by the Guardianship and Administration Tribunal
(the Tribunal) on 15 January 2004. That order appointed
MAG’s mother BJ
and MAG’s brother WA as administrators for MAG for all financial matters
for a period of five years.
[3] The administrators’ appointment was reviewed on the papers on 12
January 2009 at which time the appointment of the administrators
was extended
for three months for all financial matters. On 9 April 2009 the appointment of
the administrators was extended for a
further period of three months for all
financial matters to enable a hearing to be held.
The Issues and the Legislation
[4] The issues for the Tribunal are:
(a) Does MAG have capacity for the matter?
(b) Is there a need for an administrator? If so, who should be appointed?
[5] The threshold issue before the Tribunal is whether MAG has capacity to make
financial decisions. The Tribunal may appoint an
administrator for MAG only if
it is satisfied that he has impaired capacity for the matter. Further, there
must be a need for a decision
in relation to the matter, or there must be a need
because MAG is likely to do something in relation to the matter that involves
is likely to involve unreasonable risk to his health, welfare or property, and
that without an appointment, MAG’s needs
would not be adequately met or
his interests adequately protected. If there is a need for an appointment, the
Tribunal is required
to determine the most appropriate appointee.
[6] For the Tribunal to make an appointment of an Administrator it must be
satisfied according to the provisions of
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
12 Appointment
The Tribunal may, by order, appoint a guardian for a
personal matter, or an administrator for a financial matter, for an Adult if
Tribunal is satisfied—
Adult has impaired capacity for the matter; and
(b) there is
a need for a decision in relation to the matter or the Adult is likely to do
something in relation to the matter that
involves, or is likely to involve,
unreasonable risk to the Adult’s health, welfare or property; and
(c) without
an appointment—
Adult’s needs will not be adequately met; or
Adult’s interests will not be adequately
The appointment may be on terms considered appropriate by
the Tribunal.
The Tribunal may make the order on its own initiative or on
the Application of the Adult, the Adult Guardian or an interested
[7] The following section in respect of conflict transactions is also relevant
in this matter:
Avoid Conflict Transaction
(1) An administrator for an adult may enter into a conflict transaction
only if the tribunal authorises the transaction, conflict
transactions of that
conflict transaction
is a transaction in which there may be
conflict, or which results in conflict, between –
(a) the duty of an administrator towards the adult; and
(b) either –
(i) the interests of the administrator or a person in a close personal
business relationship with the administrator; or
(ii) another duty of the administrator
[8] The review of the appointment of BJ and WA as administrators for MAG is made
pursuant to
of the Act.
[9] This section provides as follows:
31 Appointment review process
The tribunal may conduct a review of an appointment of a
guardian or administrator (an
”) for an Adult in
the way it considers appropriate.
At the end of the review, the tribunal must revoke its
order making the appointment unless it is satisfied it would make an appointment
if a new Application for an appointment were to be made.
If the tribunal is satisfied there are appropriate
grounds for an appointment to continue, it may either—
(a) continue its order making the appointment; or
(b) change its order making the appointment, including, for
(i) changing the terms of the appointment; or
(ii) removing an appointee; or
(iii) making a new appointment.
However, the tribunal may make an order removing an
appointee only if the tribunal considers—
(a) the appointee is no longer competent; or
(b) another person is more appropriate for appointment.
An appointee is no longer competent if, for
(a) a relevant interest of the Adult has not been, or is not being,
adequately protected; or
(b) the appointee has neglected the appointee’s duties or abused the
appointee’s powers, whether generally or in relation
to a specific power;
(c) the appointee has otherwise contravened this Act.
The tribunal may include in its order changing or
revoking the appointment of an administrator a provision as to who must pay the
fee payable to the registrar of titles for advice of the change or
revocation.
[10] In making its decision, the Tribunal is bound by the general principles
found in Sch 1 of the Act. It is also bound by the appropriateness
considerations found in
of the Act which provide as follows:
15 Appropriateness considerations
In deciding whether a person is appropriate for
appointment as a guardian or administrator for an Adult, the tribunal must
the following matters
(“appropriateness
considerations
(a) the general principles and whether the person is likely to apply
(b) if the appointment is for a health matter—the health care
principle and whether the person is likely to apply it;
(c) the extent to which the Adult’s and person’s interests are
likely to conflict;
(d) whether the Adult and person are compatible including, for example,
whether the person has appropriate communication skills or
appropriate cultural
or social knowledge or experience, to be compatible with the Adult;
(e) if more than 1 person is to be appointed—whether the persons are
compatible;
(f) whether the person would be available and accessible to the
(g) the person’s appropriateness and competence to perform functions
and exercise powers under an appointment order.
The fact a person is a relation of the Adult does not,
of itself, mean the Adult’s and person’s interests are likely to
Also, the fact a person may be a beneficiary of the
Adult’s estate on the Adult’s death does not, of itself, mean the
Adult’s and person’s interests are likely to conflict.
In considering the person’s appropriateness and
competence, the tribunal must have regard to the following—
(a) the nature and circumstances of any criminal history, whether in
Queensland or elsewhere, of the person including the likelihood
the commission
of any offence in the criminal history may adversely affect the Adult;
(b) the nature and circumstances of any refusal of, or removal from,
appointment, whether in Queensland or elsewhere, as a guardian,
administrator,
Attorney or other person making a decision for someone else;
(c) if the proposed appointment is of an administrator and the person is
an individual—
(i) the nature and circumstances of the person having been a bankrupt or
taking advantage of the laws of bankruptcy as a debtor under
Bankruptcy Act
(Cwlth) or a similar law of a foreign jurisdiction; and
(ii) the nature and circumstances of a proposed, current or previous
arrangement with the person’s creditors under the
Bankruptcy Act 1966
or a similar law of a foreign jurisdiction; and
(iii) the nature and circumstances of a proposed, current or previous
external administration of a corporation, partnership or other
entity of which
the person is or was a director, secretary or partner or in whose management,
direction or control the person is
or was involved.
THE PARTIES
[11] The active parties present at the hearing on 3
June 2009 were:-
MAG - the adult
BJ - MAG’s mother and
current Administrator
NK - representative of the Public Trustee of Queensland
The Evidence
[12] In addition to the written material contained on the Tribunal file, all of
the parties attending the hearing were given the
opportunity to express their
views. These views where specifically relied upon by the Tribunal, are discussed
DOES MAG LACK CAPACITY FOR THE MATTER?
[13] Capacity is defined in the Act as;
, for a person for a
matter, means the person is capable of-
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
[14] The written evidence before the Tribunal hearing on 15 January 2004
included the Application which referred to MAG having a
mild to moderate level
of impairment due to an intellectual disability.
[15] At that hearing BJ gave oral evidence that MAG is unable to budget and
spends his money on books. He is not able to make change
denominations. BJ gave evidence that if MAG has money, he will spend it. He has
no capacity to save. She gave evidence
that MAG could not budget $50.00 or
manage his pension.
[16] At the hearing MAG was unable to explain the purpose of a budget. He agreed
that he spends his money on magazines. He was not
able to explain the correct
change for the purchase of an item for $20.00 when $50.00 was provided.
[17] The Tribunal finds that MAG has an intellectual disability. He is only able
to make simple financial decisions. He is unable
to budget or save money. The
Tribunal is satisfied that MAG’s capacity to make financial decisions
other than limited simple
decisions remained impaired. The Tribunal therefore
concludes that MAG has impaired capacity for financial matters.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATOR?
[18] The Financial Assessment Report provided by a Tribunal officer on 8 January
2009, related to an examination of the records provided
by the administrators
for the period January 2008 to 13 November 2008. For this period the opening
values showed a surplus of income
over expenses of $4,962.00. The closing values
showed a deficit of income over expenses of $12,698.00, which was not
[19] The opening values for the period showed bank accounts of $5,932.00, term
deposits of $17,000.00, and managed funds/shares of
$31,549.00. The closing
values showed bank accounts of $4,674.00, term deposits of $17,970.00, and
managed funds/shares of $26,637.00.
[20] In the Accounts of Administration the administrators declared a loan of
$6,500.00 to MAG’s brother WA, the co-administrator.
[21] On 8 January 2009 the Tribunal wrote to the administrators requesting full
details of the terms and conditions of the loan to
WA and the reason the loan
was made, within one month. An explanation of the deficit of $12,698.00 was also
[22] A response was provided by BJ in an undated letter which indicated that the
information would not be provided until the end
of February 2009, due to her
being overseas.
[23] BJ explained that she did not realise the loan from MAG to his brother
would be a conflict transaction, as it was “within
the family”.
[24] BJ advised that MAG’s pension payment on 8 January 2009 was $629.99
per fortnight plus mobility allowance of $77.36 per
fortnight. His earnings were
$81.55 per week. From this, MAG’s board and lodgings at the supported
accommodation facility of
$580.90 per fortnight was deducted. His other expenses
included Private health insurance premiums of $83.85 per month.
[25] A pay slip for MAG for the period ending 6 March 2009 confirms his gross
fortnightly income at $163.10. Centrelink documentation
notes his mobility
allowance at 25 February 2009 at $79.30, and his Disability Support Pension as
at 17 March 2009 at $630.10.
[26] The documentation refers to the following savings:
A Building Society Account $4,043.04
A Building Society Term Deposit $4,279.00
A Building Society Term Deposit lodged 30.03.09 $17,600.00
A Growth Fund as at 30.06.08 $26,637.54
[27] BJ explained that the term deposit of $17,600.00 represents the repayment
of the loan from WA to MAG of $6,000.00 plus interest
at 10%, being a total of
$6,600.00. The remaining $11,000.00 represented a further loan by MAG to BJ of
$10,000.00 plus interest
at 10% of $1,000.00.
[28] The loan to BJ was not disclosed in the annual report submitted by BJ, nor
was an application made to the Tribunal for the approval
of either of these
conflict transactions.
[29] BJ explained that her mother passed away in October 2008. Following the
administration of the estate, she had the ability to
repay the loan made by
[30] Following the receipt of the annual accounts from BJ, the Tribunal in its
letter to the administrators dated 7 April 2009, requested
that a re-submission
of the accounts for the administration period of 1 January 2008 to 13 November
2008 be re-submitted within three
weeks. This documentation was not provided by
the administrators.
[31] The Tribunal is satisfied that MAG has income by way of a Disability
Support Pension, wages and interest. He also has assets
of approximately
$26,000.00. He has personal expenses including his accommodation expenses. His
income, expenses and assets require
management. The Tribunal has determined that
without the appointment of an administrator, MAG’s financial interests
be adequately met or protected. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied
that there is a need for the appointment of an administrator
IF SO WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED?
[32] At the hearing BJ gave evidence that despite WA being appointed as a joint
and several administrator with BJ, he has not taken
any steps as administrator
for MAG. This is primarily due to his overseas commitments as a member of the
Australian Defence Forces.
BJ explained at the hearing that WA was primarily
appointed as a successive administrator in the event that she was unable to
in this role.
[33] BJ gave evidence that she was aware that as a result of engaging in
conflict transactions, an alternate administrator could
be appointed. At that
point she threatened to leave the hearing.
[34] BJ explained that while MAG lent money to her and MAG’s brother, she
did not consider this to be a conflict transaction.
She misunderstood when
appointed as administrator, that a conflict transaction did not relate to
transactions between family members,
and only related to transactions between
MAG and others.
[35] When offered the relevant section of the Act relating to conflict
transactions by a member of the Tribunal to read, BJ declined
this offer. BJ
gave evidence that she first became aware of the loans to the administrators
being a conflict transaction, when she
received correspondence from the
[36] BJ gave evidence that she had not recorded MAG’s loans to her and WA
in MAG’s books of account. She explained that
she documented these loans
in a separate set of accounts at home. She explained that the loans have been
repaid. BJ then indicated
that she was not prepared to provide further evidence
in respect of this issue, and proceeded to leave the hearing with MAG. BJ was
made aware that the hearing would proceed in the absence of BJ and MAG.
[37] The Tribunal then conducted a periodic review of the appointment of the
administrators as a result of it becoming aware of the
conflict transactions
which had not been authorised by the Tribunal.
[38] BJ was aware that the Tribunal had initiated the
current application due to it becoming aware of a conflict transaction, she
not provide evidence of the separate set of accounts relating to these
transactions to the Tribunal to the hearing. She did not
as requested by the
Tribunal in its letter to her of 7 April 2009, re-submit the accounts for the
administration period of 1 January
2008 to 13 November 2008.
[39] In view of the actions of the administrators in undertaking conflict
transactions without the Tribunal’s approval, in
view of WA’s lack
of involvement as Administrator for MAG, and in view of there being no alternate
administrator to BJ who
through her actions indicated that she did not seek to
be reappointed, the Tribunal is satisfied applying the appropriateness
considerations
of the Act, that The Public Trustee of Queensland is the
only appropriate appointee as administrator for MAG.
[40] The Public Trustee of Queensland is therefore appointed until further order
of the Tribunal.
