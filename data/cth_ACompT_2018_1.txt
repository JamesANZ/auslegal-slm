which has been the subject of regulation by the ERA.
final decision was made pursuant to the National Gas Law (
implemented in Western Australia by the
National Gas Access (WA) Act
), and the National Gas Rules
), as enacted by the
National Gas (South Australia) Act 2008
(SA) and as implemented in Western Australia by the WA Act. The NGR have
the force of law in Western Australia (see s 26 of the National
(Western Australia) Law (
). In Western Australia, the underlying
NGL as modified from time to time applies as the NGL(WA). The text of the
NGL(WA) is set
out in Schedule 1 to the WA Act. Section 9(1) of the
WA Act provides that

final decision addressed an amended revised access arrangement proposal (
owners’ amended proposal

owners of the pipeline on 22 February 2016.
owners of the pipeline are DBNGP (WA) Transmission Pty Ltd, acting on its own

and in respect of the

Immediately
before the commencement of the hearing of the Review Application, which
commenced at 10.15 am on 13 February 2017, the
Tribunal directed that
the owners have leave to apply to the Tribunal for a review of the ROE decision
and the gamma decision. At
the time when it made that direction, the Tribunal
informed the parties that it would provide reasons for its decision to grant
leave as part of its Reasons for Determination which would be published in
due course in support of its decision in respect of grounds

by the owners in their Review Application.
pipeline is Western Australia’s key gas transmission pipeline, extending
over some 1,539 km underground. It originates
at a point immediately
adjacent to the North West Shelf Joint Ventures Domestic Gas Plant on the Burrup
Peninsula in the Pilbara
region of Western Australia and passes through the
Perth metropolitan area, Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup, ultimately terminating
at Main Line Valve 157 which is located at Clifton Road, north of Bunbury, in
the south-west region of Western Australia.
pipeline is an
“old scheme covered pipeline”
“scheme pipeline”
“covered pipeline”
under the WA Act, the NGL(WA) and the NGR. It is also a
“designated
within the definition of
“designated
in s 2 of the NGL(WA) (see s 4 of the
Gas Access (WA) (Part 3) Regulations 2009
and cl 2(1) of
Sch 1 to those Regulations).
of the owners is a
“service provider”
within the meaning of
s 8 of the NGL(WA). This is because the owners own, control and operate a
scheme pipeline.
pipeline is an ERA pipeline within the meaning of that expression as defined in
s 9(1) of the WA Act. For this reason, the ERA
is designated as the
relevant regulator (see the definition of
“regulator”
27 of the NGL(WA) prescribes the functions and powers of the ERA. The ERA is
responsible for the economic regulation of pipeline
services provided by service
providers (such as the owners) by means of or in connection with a scheme
pipeline. In particular,
under Pt 9 of the NGR, the ERA is responsible for
determining the total revenue for each regulatory year of an access arrangement
period which the owners may earn for the provision by the owners of pipeline
services through the pipeline.
THE REGULATORY PROCESS
31 December 2014, the owners submitted to the ERA proposed revisions to the
access arrangement for the pipeline (
the owners’ original
). That proposal was submitted to the ERA pursuant to r 52 of
the NGR, the role of the ERA was to approve, or not approve, the proposed
revised access arrangement contained in the owners’
original proposal in
accordance with the NGL(WA) and the NGR.
20 April 2015, the ERA published an issues paper in response to the
owners’ original proposal and, at the same time, invited
submissions from
interested parties. Some submissions were received.
22 December 2015, the ERA published its Draft Decision in relation to the
owners’ original proposal (
draft decision
). The draft decision was
not to approve the owners’ original proposal. In its draft decision, the
ERA said that the owners
had to make 74 amendments to their proposal before it
would approve the access arrangement contained therein. At the same time,
ERA invited the owners to submit revisions to their original proposal and to do
so by 22 February 2016.
22 February 2016, the owners submitted their amended proposal. At the same
time, they also provided supporting information to
ERA then invited public submissions in respect of its draft decision and in
respect of the owners’ amended proposal. The
closing date for such
submissions was 22 March 2016. Three interested parties made submissions
to the ERA as did the owners.
ERA subsequently invited a further round of public submissions in relation to a
matter which had not been considered in the draft
decision. Further submissions
were received from the owners and from one other interested party.
pars 9–14 of its final decision, the ERA made the following remarks
concerning the process which it had undertaken in dealing
with the owners’
application to have revisions made to the access arrangement in respect of the
28(1) and (2) of the NGL(WA) were substantially amended in 2013 to require the
Authority to specify how the constituent components
of this Final Decision
related to each other and how the Authority has taken those interrelationships
into account. Subsequent to
these amendments, the NGL now anticipates that there
may be more than one possible decision that will or is likely to contribute
the achievement of the NGO. In such cases, the Authority must make the decision
that will or is likely to contribute to the achievement
of the NGO to the
greatest degree, and provide reasons.
NGL(WA) does not prescribe how the Authority is to apply the requirements and,
as a result, the Authority has used its regulatory
judgement. The Authority has
applied these requirements by determining total revenue and reference tariffs in
accordance with the
detailed requirements of the NGR.
Authority’s Final Decision is complex and many of the components of the
decision are interrelated. The adoption of a value
for a component has
implications for other elements or values elsewhere in the decision. For
the value of
imputation credits (gamma) has an impact on the estimated cost of corporate
income tax;
the value of
imputation credits (gamma) has an impact on the estimate of the return on
equity, through the estimates of the market
risk premium;
the definition
of the benchmark efficient entity has strong links to all aspects of the rate of
return, including:
– the composition of the
benchmark efficient sample;
– the relevant estimation methods, financial models and market data and
other evidence used for estimating the return on equity
and the return on
– the gearing;
– the credit rating; and
– the debt risk
the return on debt is considered in conjunction with the return on equity, to
ensure consistency;
the definition of the benchmark efficient entity also has implications for
whether to revalue the RAB at each access arrangement
the service provider’s governance arrangements and risk management will
affect most aspects of the proposal, including capital
and operating expenditure
forecasts; and
the approved demand forecasts will affect the calculation of reference
making its decision in accordance with the detailed requirements of the NGR and
being mindful of any interrelationships between
components, the Authority
considers that it has made a Final Decision that will or is likely to contribute
to the achievement of
the NGO to the greatest degree. The Authority’s
assessment is set out in the following sections of this Final Decision.
considering DBP’s amended proposal and its supporting submissions, the
submissions from other interested parties, and
advice from the Authority’s
technical and economic advisors, the Authority’s Final Decision is not to
approve the amended
proposal. The Authority’s reasons for refusing to
approve the amended proposal are set out in this Final Decision.
rule 64 of the NGR, when the Authority refuses to approve an access arrangement
proposal, the Authority is required to itself
propose revisions to the access
arrangement and make a decision giving effect to its proposal within two months
of its Final Decision.
24 The above remarks accurately capture the
fundamental features of the regulatory task which the ERA was obliged to
the present case, as permitted by r 64(3) of the NGR, the ERA decided not
to consult on its ultimate access arrangement proposal.
Instead, the ERA, as
part of the final decision, made a decision giving effect to its access
arrangement proposed under r 64(4)
of the NGR. That decision is a
“reviewable regulatory decision”
(see the definition in
s 2 of the NGL(WA) and s 244 of the NGL(WA)). It is also a
“designated reviewable regulatory decision”
definition in s 2 of the NGL(WA)).
to r 64(6) of the NGR, the revisions to the access arrangement made by the
ERA took effect from 1 July 2016.
ERA included within the final decision its proposed revisions to the
owners’ amended proposal and its own revisions to the
access arrangement.
minor corrections were made to the final decision on 20 July 2016. The
form of the final decision under consideration in the
present matter
incorporates the revisions made on 20 July 2016.

been made out any matter that was not raised and maintained
by the provider in
submissions to the AER before the decision was made;
(b) a covered pipeline service provider whose commercial interests are
materially affected by the decision being reviewed may not
raise in relation to
the issue of whether a ground for review exists or has been made out any matter
that was not raised and maintained
by the provider in submissions to the AER
before the decision was made;
(c) an affected or interested person or body (other than a provider under
paragraph (a) or (b)) may not raise in relation to the
issue of whether a ground

to the AER before the decision was made;
(d) subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) —
(i) the applicant, or an

29 and WA Gazette 14 Mar 2014 p. 632.]
powers of the Tribunal in respect of merits review by it of designated
reviewable regulatory decisions are set out in s 259.
That section is in
the following terms:
must make determination
(1) If, following an application, the Tribunal grants
leave in accordance with section 245, the Tribunal must make a determination
respect of the application.
See section 260 for the time limit within
which the Tribunal must make its
determination.
(2) Subject to subsections (4) and (4a), a determination
under this section may —
(a) affirm the reviewable regulatory
decision; or
(b) vary the reviewable regulatory decision; or
(c) set aside the reviewable regulatory decision and remit the matter back to
the original decision maker to make the decision again
in accordance with any
direction or recommendation of the
(3) For the purposes of making a determination of the
kind in subsection (2)(a) or (b), the Tribunal may perform all the functions
exercise all the powers of the original decision maker under this Law or the
(4) In deciding whether to remit a matter back to the original decision maker to
make the decision again, other than in a case where
the decision is a designated
reviewable regulatory decision, the Tribunal must have regard to the nature and
relative complexities
(a) the reviewable regulatory decision;
(b) the matter the subject of the review.
(4a) In a case where the decision is a designated
reviewable regulatory decision, the Tribunal may only make a determination
(a) to vary the designated reviewable
regulatory decision under subsection (2)(b); or
(b) to set aside the designated reviewable regulatory decision and remit the
matter back to the AER under subsection (2)(c),
(c) the Tribunal is satisfied that to do so will, or is likely to, result in a
decision that is materially preferable to the designated
reviewable regulatory
decision in making a contribution to the achievement of the national gas
objective (a
materially preferable designated NGO decision
if the Tribunal is not so satisfied the Tribunal must affirm the decision);
(d) in the case of a determination to vary the designated reviewable regulatory
decision—the Tribunal is satisfied that to
do so will not require the
Tribunal to undertake an assessment of such complexity that the preferable
course of action would be to
set aside the decision and remit the matter to the
AER to make the decision again.
(4b) In connection with the operation of subsection (4a)
(and without limiting any other matter that may be relevant under this Law)
(a) the Tribunal must consider how the
constituent components of the designated reviewable regulatory decision
interrelate with each
other and with the matters raised as a ground for review;
(b) without limiting paragraph (a), the Tribunal must take into account the
revenue and pricing principles (in the same manner in
which the AER is to take
into account these principles under section 28); and
(c) the Tribunal must, in assessing the extent of contribution to the
achievement of the national gas objective, consider the designated
regulatory decision as a whole; and (d) the following matters must not, in
themselves, determine the question about whether
a materially preferable
designated NGO decision exists:
(i) the establishment of a
ground for review under section 246(1);
(ii) consequences for, or impacts on, the average annual regulated revenue of a
covered pipeline service provider;
(iii) that the amount that is specified in or derived from the designated
reviewable regulatory decision exceeds the amount specified
(4c) If the Tribunal makes a determination under
subsection (2)(b) or (c), the Tribunal must specify in its determination —
(a) the manner in which it has taken into
account the interrelationship between the constituent components of the
designated reviewable
regulatory decision and how they relate to the matters
raised as a ground for review as contemplated by subsection (4b)(a); and
(b) in the case of a determination to vary the designated reviewable regulatory
decision—the reasons why it is proceeding to
make the variation in view of
the requirements of subsection (4a)(d).
(5) A determination by the Tribunal affirming, varying
or setting aside the reviewable regulatory decision is, for the purposes of
Law (other than this Part), to be taken to be a decision of the original
decision maker.

arrangement decision in place
of an access arrangement that the AER did not approve, the Tribunal may consider

summary, Sch 2 to the NGL(WA) requires that, unless displaced by a contrary
intention appearing in the NGL(WA) or in the NGR (as
may be appropriate), the
following principles are to be applied to the interpretation of the NGL(WA), the
NGR and the Regs:
interpretation that will best achieve the purpose or object of the NGL(WA) is to
be preferred to any other interpretation.
That purpose or object need not be
expressly stated in the NGL(WA) (cl 7 of Sch 2 to the NGL(WA)).
(b) The NGO is
the core or fundamental objective of the NGL(WA) and, as such, is to be regarded
as within the expression
“the purpose or object of the
circumstances described in cl 8 of Sch 2 to the NGL(WA), resort may be
had to the types of extrinsic material specified
in cl 8 as an aid to the
interpretation of a provision of the NGL(WA) or the NGR (as the case may be).
Such resort can be had if:
relevant provision is ambiguous or obscure; or
ordinary meaning of the provision leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable (a result which should be avoided);
confirm the interpretation that is conveyed by the ordinary meaning of the

assisting in the interpretation. Subclause (4) of cl 8 must also be taken
into account.
That subclause is difficult to interpret. In our view, that
subclause mandates that those charged with interpreting the NGL(WA)
and the NGR
must, when considering whether to have regard to extrinsic material, have regard
to each of the three matters specified
in subcl (4). A
within the meaning of cl 8(4)(c) is a matter which is to
be determined by the decision maker to be relevant in an objective sense.
the decision maker does have regard to the three matters specified in
subcl (4)(c), that person (or entity) must also have regard
to those same

(d) Clause 7 and cl 8 of Sch 2 do not authorise a wholesale redrafting
of the relevant provisions. The quest is always to find the
interpretation of those provisions, not to embark upon an exposition of the
decision maker’s view of what the provision
should mean.
(e) In the NGL(WA), the meaning of

NGL(WA) notwithstanding any rule of construction to the contrary.

) at [77], the Tribunal said:
The ultimate objective reflected in the NEO and NGO is
to direct the manner in which the national electricity market and the national
natural gas market are regulated, that is, in the long term interests of
consumers of electricity and natural gas respectively with
respect to the
matters specified. The provisions proceed on the legislative premise that their
long term interests are served through
the promotion of efficient investment in,
and efficient operation and use of, electricity and natural gas services. This
is to be done “for” the long term interests of consumers.
It does not involve a balance as between efficient investment,
operation and use
on the one hand and the long term interest of consumers on the other. Rather,
the necessary legislative premise
is that the long term interests of consumers
will be served by regulation that advances economic
efficiency.

Tribunal considered the RPP and the inter-relationship between the NEO/NGO and
the RPP. Those decisions, together with
PIAC and Ausgrid
, confirm that
the NGO and the RPP are complementary, such that a decision which is
inconsistent with the RPP cannot be a decision
that will or is likely to
contribute to the achievement of the NGO.
[75]–[78] in
Energy Australia
, the Tribunal observed:
The principles in s 7A can be taken to be consistent
with and to promote the objectives in s 7. The principles are themselves stated
normatively in the form of what is intended to be achieved. They state that the
price charged by a Network Service Provider (‘NSP’)
for its service
should allow a return commensurate with the regulatory and commercial risks
involved in providing the service in
the context that the NSP should be provided
with a reasonable opportunity to recover at least the efficient costs it incurs
effective incentives in order to promote economic efficiency with
respect to the services it provides. Economic efficiency includes
investment in the system with which it provides services, efficient provision of
services, and efficient use of the system.
It is well accepted in the literature of regulatory economics and in regulatory
practice that all these efficiency objectives are
in principle met by setting
prices for services that allow the recovery of efficient costs, including the
cost of capital commensurate
with the riskiness of the investment in the assets
(infrastructure or ‘system’, as the term is used in the NEL) used
provide services.
It might be asked why the NEL principles require that the regulated NSP be
provided with the opportunity to recover at least its
efficient costs. Why
‘at least’? The issue of opportunity is critical to the answer.
The regulatory framework does
not guarantee recovery of costs, efficient or
otherwise. Many events and circumstances, all characterised by various
uncertainties,
intervene between the ex ante regulatory setting of prices and
the ex post assessment of whether costs were recovered. But if, as
it were, the
dice are loaded against the NSP at the outset by the regulator not providing the
opportunity for it to recover its efficient
costs (eg, by making insufficient
provision for its operating costs or its cost of capital), then the NSP will not
have the incentives
to achieve the efficiency objectives, the achievement of
which is the purpose of the regulatory regime.
Thus, given that the regulatory setting of prices is determined prior to
ascertaining the actual operating environment that will
prevail during the
regulatory control period, the regulatory framework may be said to err on the
side of allowing at least the recovery
of efficient costs. This is in the
context of no adjustment generally being made after the event for changed
circumstances.
similar vein, at [15] in
ElectraNet No 3
, the Tribunal
The national electricity objective provides the
overarching economic objective for regulation under the Law: the promotion of
investment in the long term interests of consumers. Consumers will
benefit in the long run if resources are used efficiently, i.e.
resources are
allocated to the delivery of goods and services in accordance with consumer
preferences at least cost. As reflected
in the revenue and pricing principles,
this in turn requires prices to reflect the long run cost of supply and to
support efficient
investment, providing investors with a return which covers the
opportunity cost of capital required to deliver the

, the Tribunal considered that the amendments to the NGL
effected by the
Statutes Amendment (National Electricity and Gas
Laws—Limited Merits Review) Act 2013
change the meaning of the NGO or the RPP or their relationships. At [537], the
Tribunal said:
It may be that the difference in views between the
Networks NSW and the AER is semantic. The Tribunal, of course, accepts that
are matters of judgment about
the RPP (or a particular element
of one of the principles) should be taken into account. It does not accept
that, as perhaps the
AER is saying, the NEO in its application may give rise to
a result which means that a DNSP is
given a reasonable opportunity to
recover at least its efficient costs in providing the direct control network
services. As the
Tribunal has sought to express in its Introductory remarks, it
does not regard ss 7 and 7A as other than complementary so that the
give rise to a reviewable regulatory decision which in fact is inconsistent with
the RPP or one of the elements of the RPP.
at [787], the Tribunal stated (relevantly):
... As the Tribunal has discussed, the NEO and the
RPP operate together. It is not the case that the NEO means that, where the
term interests of consumers is relevant, the RPP must be ignored or
suppressed. The assumption in the regulatory scheme is that
the long term
interests of consumers is served by ensuring that monopoly infrastructure
providers are permitted to recover at least
the efficient costs of providing
those services and, broadly speaking, the AER’s role is to fix those
efficient costs by reference
to the proxy of the efficient costs of the
competitive market. That is, of course, an oversimplification.

the Full Court considered applications for judicial review of
and three related matters. This judgment was delivered on
24 May 2017, after the hearing in the present matter had concluded. The
Tribunal gave the parties an opportunity to file a Written Submission addressing
the significance (if any) of that decision. Both
parties availed themselves of
that opportunity—the owners by Written Submission dated 12 July
2017and the ERA by a responsive
Written Submission dated 2 August 2017.
introducing the matters before it, in
AER v ACT (No 2)
[8], the Full Court said:
As set out in the AER’s written submissions, the
AER’s challenge to the Tribunal’s determinations was directed
principally
to the following core concerns:
(a) The Tribunal had failed to undertake its review function lawfully by failing
to properly construe and apply the grounds of review
under s 71C of the NEL
and s 246 of the NGL. Errors of this kind led the Tribunal to carry out
reviews of a kind that were not authorised
by the legislation.
(b) In one instance, the Tribunal purported to review a decision of a type that
did not and could not fall within its jurisdiction.
This related only to the
fifth matter, NSD 420 of 2016, which, as we have said, involves JGN and the NGL
and the NGR and is the subject
of separate reasons published today.
(c) The Tribunal allowed the distribution network service providers and the
covered pipeline service provider to raise, in relation
to whether a ground of
review existed, matters that were not raised and maintained by the service
providers in submissions to the
AER before the reviewable regulatory decisions
were made, thus contravening the constraints imposed by s 71O(2) of the NEL
258(3) of the NGL.
(d) The Tribunal erred in its construction of new provisions in the NER and the
NGR relating to the determination of the rate of
return on capital, the value of
imputation credits and the operating expenditure criteria.
(e) The Tribunal made other reviewable errors in making its decision, including
adopting reasoning that was irrational, unreasonable
36 [139] in
AER v ACT (No 2)
, the Full Court observed that, when
considering an application for a review of the type under consideration in the
present matter,
the Tribunal does not start again. The Court said that,
similarly, the limited form of administrative merits review under s 71C
does not authorise the Tribunal to intervene on the basis of mere disagreement
with the Regulator’s decision. The Full Court
also noted that, in a
particular case, there may be overlap between the grounds upon which an
application may be made to the Tribunal
to review a decision of the Regulator
and, consequently, the grounds upon which the Tribunal might act.
36 [141], the Full Court said that the ground of review described in
s 71C(1)(c) which, in all material respects, is the same as
the ground of
review specified in s 246(1)(c) of the NGL(WA), should be understood as
encompassing the words in
House v The King
(1936) 55 CLR 499
“If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or
irrelevant matters to guide or affect him ... if he does
not take into
account some material consideration ...”.
Material error of law
causing an incorrect exercise of discretion would be included. The Full Court
went on to say that failure
properly to exercise the discretion based on
inference from the character of the result as
“unreasonable or plainly
is available under subpar (c) of s 71C(1) (and
s 246(1)(c)) and may also be available under subpar (d) of
s 71C(1) (and s 246(1))
in circumstances where the incorrect exercise
of the discretion has the consequence that the Regulator’s decision is
unreasonable.
36 [143], the Full Court said:
Having said that, in our opinion paragraph (d), that the
AER’s decision was unreasonable, having regard to all the circumstances,
is not limited to
unreasonableness and indeed, as made clear
unreasonableness is not the starting
point for the standard of reasonableness nor should it be considered the end
37 [144], the Full Court explained the meaning of
“discretion”
when used in the relevant regulatory provisions.
The Full Court said:
As to the word “discretion”, we consider
that in context this term does not extend to a choice by the AER between facts
or opinions, which it has authority to decide, but primarily refers to express
or implied statutory choices, where those assessments
call for value judgments
in respect of which there is room for reasonable differences of opinion, no
particular opinion being uniquely
right. The contrast is with an order the
making of which is dictated by the application of a fixed rule to the facts on
operation depends:

Full Court then went on to discuss the previous Full Court decision of
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Competition
[2006] FCAFC 83
(2016) 152 FCR 33
73–74 [171]–[172] in
, the Full Court considered a
ground of review directed to errors in the Regulator’s finding of facts.
In that part of the
Court’s Reasons, the Court held that a choice between
permitted methodologies for the calculation of total revenue mentioned
s 8.4 of the relevant code was not a finding of fact. The Court also held
that it was not a fact finding error to base that choice
upon one methodology
rather than another. In In
ACCC v ACT,
the Full Court held that the
relative weight to be given to the factors set out in the relevant statutory
provision was a matter of
discretion rather than a finding of fact which can be
impugned as such.
37–38 [145] of
AER v ACT (No 2)
, the Full Court observed that
the previous Full Court in
had stated that findings of fact
may include a finding which was the opinion about the existence of a future fact
or circumstance.
The Court noted that the previous Full Court expressed the
opinion that the expression
“findings of fact”
interpreted so as to encompass opinions formed by the primary decision maker
based upon approaches to the assessment of
facts and methodologies which it had
chosen to apply. At the end of [145], the Full Court said:
... In our opinion, an error in making a finding of
fact would not always extend to an opinion about the existence of a future fact
or circumstance but, for example, would include an error as to what the opinion
of an expert was even where that opinion was about
the existence of a future
fact or circumstance.
Full Court in
AER v ACT (No 2)
then expressed the following opinions
(at 38–39 [146]–[150]):
As we have set out above, the AER submitted that when
the Tribunal considered whether there was an “error of fact”, the
concept of “error” set a threshold that was not passed simply
because there was material that could support a different
finding of fact or
simply because the Tribunal might, if it considered the material afresh, prefer
to make a different finding of
at [326] and
at [22]. Thus far we agree.
The AER went on to submit that before a finding of fact could be characterised
as erroneous, more must be established by a review
applicant: such as the
absence of evidence supporting the finding made. In our opinion, although it is
correct to say that more must
be established than that the Tribunal prefers to
make a different finding of fact, it is not to be thought that “no
is any more than an example of a finding of fact which is
erroneous. It was in that context that
Pfizer Pty Ltd v Birkett
, relied on by the AER, was decided in relation to the
admissibility of expert opinion evidence. We do not see that decision as being
of any wider assistance in the construction of s 71C of the
s 246 of the
For example, we accept the submission on behalf of the electricity network
respondents that the concept of ‘findings of fact’
encompasses more
than ‘primary’ fact finding. In our opinion, findings of facts
within s 71C would generally include
inferences drawn from primary facts or
conclusions drawn from primary facts. We would also observe that we would not
regard ‘evaluative
judgment’ as an appropriate discrimen for the
purposes of s 71C. In our opinion, depending on the particular
circumstances,
‘findings of fact’ may include such a finding even
where it is based on an ‘evaluative judgment’.
Considering the four available grounds in s 71C overall, and stating again
that mere disagreement with the AER, whether as to facts
or exercises of
discretion or overall, is not a basis on which the Tribunal may intervene, it
would in our opinion be strange as
a matter of statutory construction if there
were classes of material error on the part of the AER which the Tribunal
discerned but
which were beyond the Tribunal’s reach and resulted in areas
of decision-making immune from (limited) review. To conclude that
some findings of fact or exercises of discretion which were not susceptible to
review by the Tribunal for material error
seems to us to be unlikely as a matter
of the intention of the legislature. In our view the touchstone for s 71C
material error is
that the Tribunal may not act where there is no error and
error is not made out by choosing one available fact or opinion over others.
example, the mere availability of a different inference from facts would not
establish error within s 71C: the Tribunal must
find that there was error
in the AER’s decision-making before it may intervene.
It is not, in our opinion, possible or desirable to attempt to bring any more
precision to the concept of an error or errors of fact
in the AER’s
findings of fact. The parties will assert or deny that such an error or errors
was or were made and it will then
be necessary for the Tribunal to evaluate the
nature of that claimed error or those claimed errors. In doing so, in our
the Tribunal should recognise the permissible field of choice which the
legislature has given to the AER.
39–40 [152]–[159], the Full Court interpreted the expression
“materially preferable NEO decision”
. The views expressed in
these paragraphs are equally apt to be applied in respect of the same expression
used in the NGL(WA) in
relation to the NGO. The Full Court said:
As to the “materially preferable NEO
decision”, we accept the AER’s submission that an implicit statutory
is that a decision rectifying errors revealed by established grounds of
review may not lead to a decision that is “materially
preferable” to
the decision made by the AER since, if the correction of errors revealed by
established grounds of review necessarily
resulted in a materially preferable
NEO decision, then s 71P(2a) would have no work to do.
We construe the word “materially” in this context to mean not only
that the error must be relevant or pertinent but that
the future decision would
be or would be likely to be preferable to an important degree or extent.
In our opinion the words “would, or would be likely to, result in” a
materially preferable decision do not need lengthy
explanation. The first
permutation of the words, “would... result in” involves a conclusion
on the part of the Tribunal
at a high level of certainty, while the second
permutation of the words, “would be likely to... result in” involves
conclusion on the part of the Tribunal at a lower level of certainty but
requiring that the conclusion be “more likely than
We see the first permutation as more applicable where the result of the
Tribunal’s review is certain because the Tribunal has
specifically varied
the regulatory decision and the second permutation as more applicable where the
Tribunal has set aside the regulatory
decision and remit the matter back to the
The identified mischief to which the amending legislation was directed was
“cherry picking”. We accept the submission
on behalf of the Minister
that whether there will be, or would be likely to be, a materially preferable
decision to the decision
in fact made by the regulator depends on an assessment
of the decision as a whole, and a comparison of that decision with a putative
alternative decision, either by the Tribunal or by the AER on remitter: it does
not depend simply on an assessment of errors in individual
components of the
decision under review.
At a general level, we see no reviewable error on the part of the Tribunal in
its consideration of this issue of a materially preferable
NEO decision, at
[31]-[49], [65]-[101], and [1176]-[1226]. Each of those paragraphs must be read
in context, as expressly recognised
in the submissions on behalf of the
In relation to PIAC’s submission that s 16(1)(d) of the NEL is of
present significance, we do not accept that submission. The
submission was that
s 16(1)(d) imposed a substantive obligation that sat atop, and confined,
the discretions or judgements afforded
to the AER under the NER and that this,
in turn, had a consequential effect on the scope of the available grounds of
review in the
Tribunal, particularly s 71C(1)(c) and (d).
In our opinion, that provision requires, where there are 2 or more possible
reviewable regulatory decisions that will or are likely
to contribute to the
achievement of the national electricity objective, the AER must make the
decision that it is satisfied will
or is likely to contribute to the achievement
of that objective to the greatest degree. In our opinion, in so providing, the
legislature
is making express, perhaps unnecessarily, the content of what is
preferable. The provision then goes on to require the AER to specify
to the basis on which it is satisfied that the decision is the preferable
reviewable regulatory decision.
addressing the matters to which we have referred at [119]–[120] above, the
Full Court went on to consider the particular
grounds of review raised by the
AER in the case before it.
145–173 [618]–[784], the Full Court examined several grounds of
review directed to alleged errors made by the Tribunal
in relation to the value
of imputation credits (gamma). Much of what the Full Court said in this part of
its Reasons is relevant
to the present case and we shall return to discuss the
observations of the Full Court when considering the issue of gamma.
a further decision delivered on 18 January 2018 (
SA Power Networks v
Australian Competition Tribunal (No 2)
[2018] FCAFC 3
), the Full Court confirmed its reasoning in
. It also reaffirmed the basis of its decision in relation to
AER v ACT (No 2)
(at [52] to [57]). The parties to this
application were also given an opportunity to make submissions as to the
significance of
for the present matter. The ERA availed itself of
that opportunity and lodged a Written Submission dated 3 April 2018. The
did not lodge any submission in response to that invitation.
THE GROUNDS OF REVIEW
owners rely upon two separate grounds of review although, unsurprisingly, they
are inter-related.
the owners challenge the ROE decision. Second, the owners challenge the
ERA’s determination of a value for imputation
credits (gamma) of 0.4.
to the owners, their challenge to the ROE decision involves a relatively narrow,
though significant, issue concerning the
approach adopted by the ERA in the
final decision toward the
“downward bias”
in estimates of the return on equity for low beta stocks
derived from the Sharpe Lintner Capital Asset Pricing Model (
which was the ERA’s chosen model for determining the return on equity as
part of the allowed rate of return under r 87 of
owners contended that the ERA’s approach to estimating the return on
equity (and consequently, the allowed rate of return)
is erroneous and contrary
to the requirements of r 87 of the NGR, primarily because of its treatment
of downward bias (or
“positive alpha”
) within its chosen
model, the SL-CAPM.
owners also argued that, in the final decision, the ERA took no account of, and
made no adjustment for, the actual or potential
bias in the SL-CAPM. Instead,
the ERA derived a return on equity by an application of the SL-CAPM in its
standard, theoretical form
– absent any adjustment for actual or potential
bias or underestimation.
the owners descended into great detail as to the circumstances in which the ERA
came to make that decision and contended
that a number of other errors were made
in the reasoning process which led to the errors which we have identified at
[126]–[128]
above, nonetheless the critical errors are those identified in
those paragraphs. The owners argued that they had made out several
grounds specified in s 246(1) of the NGL(WA) in respect of those errors and
were entitled to relief.
to the owners’ challenge to the ERA’s decision in respect of gamma,
the owners argued that the rules relating to gamma
are essentially the same as
between the NER and the NGR. They then submitted that the decisions of the
Tribunal and of the AER,
in relation to the equivalent provision in
cl 6.5.3 of the NER which deals with gamma, are of immediate and direct
relevance in considering
the proper interpretation and application of r 87A
of the NGR. In this regard, the owners relied upon
owners argued that the ERA’s determination that gamma should be 0.4 (being
the mid-point of a range of gamma of 0.28 to
0.55) was based upon an incorrect
construction and application of r 87 and r 87A of the NGR and the
application of an erroneous conclusion
arrived at by the ERA to the effect that
its figure derived from tax statistics of 0.48 for gamma is a point estimate,
upper bound, for theta. Had the correct conclusion been applied, the
figure from the tax statistics would have been 0.34.
considering the asserted grounds of review, it must be remembered that there
will often be no clear distinction between the available
grounds of review
specified in s 246(1) of the NGL(WA). The section, and the regime, permit
overlap between the available grounds
of error identified.
Application by ATCO Gas Australia Pty Ltd
[2016] ACompT 10
at [47], the Tribunal said that:
(1) the line between the several available grounds for
review is not necessarily always clear cut;
(2) there is no clear line between factual error, opinion, and discretionary
judgment, as one may feed into the other;
(3) any such error or errors — if accepted by the Tribunal — may be
a combination of error or errors of fact, wrongful
exercise of discretion, and
the outcome of an unreasonable decision.
order to determine whether the ERA made an error of fact for the purposes of
s 246(1)(a) and (b) of the NGL(WA), the Tribunal must:
(a) ascertain
the precise conclusion of fact made by the ERA;
(b) determine
whether, within that conclusion, there is a finding of fact (or facts) that can
properly be said to be erroneous (of
erroneous in combination); and
finding or fact (or combination of facts) was erroneous, determine whether the
error was material to the making of the
at [34]–[37]).
“finding of fact”
should be interpreted broadly to be
meaningful in relation to the function of the ERA under review. Findings of
fact may concern
the existence of a present or historical fact, being an event
or circumstance. However,
“findings of facts”
do not include
the making of choices between permitted methodologies. This was the clear view
of the Full Court in
and, although to some extent possibly
qualified in some respects in
AER v ACT (No 2)
, seems to be
nonetheless a correct statement of principle.
Application by ActewAGL Distribution
[2010] ACompT 4
Tribunal considered the meaning of a
“discretionary
. At [34], the Tribunal said:
... It is most commonly applied to decision making
which involves essentially a weighing up of relevant facts. First the decision
maker finds the facts. Then the decision maker undertakes a weighing up process
which involves taking into account considerations
that are found to be relevant,
assessing the weight to be given to those considerations so assessed and
determining what, as a result
of that process, is the right result.
, the Tribunal described certain classes of decision that may
attract the conclusion that there had been an incorrect exercise of
in the following way (at [39]):
[Decisions]:
(1) based upon a misconstruction or misapplication of relevant principles,
methodologies or factors required to be considered by
the NGL or NGR;
(2) affected by a failure to have regard to a mandatory relevant factor
prescribed by the NGL or the NGR;
(3) affected by the regulator taking into account factors which are extraneous
to those relevant under the NGL or NGR; or
(4) affected by a failure to take into account a relevant submission.
[will involve an incorrect exercise of discretion.]
incorrect exercise of discretion as a ground of review is not available merely
because the Tribunal would exercise a discretion
in a different way. If the ERA
has exercised its discretion correctly, in accordance with correct principles,
and if the particular
exercise of discretion was open to it within the framework
of the NGL, then it is not for the Tribunal to substitute a decision which
might prefer on the material before the decision maker (see
Application by Envestra Limited (No 2)
at [51]–[54], the Tribunal explained the ground of review
“unreasonableness”
in the following way:
The concept of unreasonableness goes beyond
unreasonableness but is still limited. There must be logical
error or irrationality in the decision. To make out this ground, the
decision must not be justified by reference to its stated reasons. In ACCC v
ACT, the Full Court stated at [178]:
The concept of
‘unreasonableness’ imports want of reason. That is to say the
particular discretion exercised by the [regulator]
is not justified by reference
to its stated reasons. There may be an error in logic or some discontinuity or
non sequitur in the
reasoning. It may be that the decision has an element of
arbitrariness about it because there is an absence of reason to explain
discretionary choices made by the [regulator] in arriving at its
conclusion.
The Tribunal repeated and applied this statement in
ElectraNet (No 3)
at [65] and in
EnergyAustralia
at [66]-[67].
the Tribunal said that a decision will be unreasonable if it
is arbitrary or capricious. It said at [35]:
It is, we think, neither possible nor
necessary to give an exhaustive definition of what is an unreasonable decision.
At one extreme
a decision that is arbitrary or capricious will plainly be
unreasonable. At the other extreme, it will not be sufficient merely to
different decision to the first instance decision maker; in many areas
reasonable persons can perfectly reasonably come to
opposite conclusions.
A decision which is not determined by reference to the
applicable criteria in the NGL or the NGR is likely to be unreasonable in all
the circumstances:
Energy Australia
at [68]. A failure to take into
account a matter which is required to be considered or consideration of a matter
which is irrelevant
may also give rise to a decision which is unreasonable:
similar vein, in
at [43]–[46], the Tribunal
For the unreasonableness ground in s 246(1)(d) of
the NGL to be established, it must involve logical error or irrationality in the
decision, and the decision must not be justified by reference to its stated
reasons. A decision will be unreasonable if there is
an absence of reason to
explain the discretionary choices made by the ERA in arriving at its
conclusions.
It is not possible to give an exhaustive definition of what constitutes an
unreasonable decision. However, at one end of the spectrum,
an arbitrary or
capricious decision will be unreasonable, but at the other end of the spectrum,
it is not sufficient merely to reach
a different view to the original decision
A decision which is not determined by reference to the applicable criteria in
the NGL or the NGR is likely to be unreasonable in
all the circumstances. A
failure to take into account a matter which is required to be considered, or
consideration of a matter
which is irrelevant, may also constitute
unreasonableness.
The unreasonableness ground in s 246(1)(d) and the incorrect exercise of
discretion ground in s 246(1)(c) overlap to a certain extent.
For example,
if the reasons for a decision contain logical error or an unexplained
discretionary choice made in reaching a conclusion,
then the decision is likely
to be unreasonable.

pp 69 to 247 (pars 206 to 1,182), the ERA addressed the concept of
Total Revenue for the purposes of rr 72 to 87A.

concerning the Revenue Building Blocks.

Considerations of the Authority
The Authority’s Final Decision on DBP’s Total Revenue requirement is
documented in the following sections.
Operating Expenditure;
Opening Capital Base;
Projected Capital Base;
Rate of Return;
Depreciation;
Incentive Mechanism; and
Allocation of Total Revenue between Reference Services and Other
As a result of the Authority’s assessment of
DBP’s proposed total revenue building blocks as per rule 76 of the NGR,
out in detail below, the Authority has not approved DBP’s proposed
total revenue for the fourth access arrangement (AA4) period.
Authority’s Final Decision for approved total revenue by building block in
real and nominal dollars is set out in Table
7 and Table 8 respectively.
Figure 3 compares DBP’s proposed revenue building blocks with the building
blocks approved in the Authority’s Final Decision.
Figure 4 compares DBP’s proposed revenue building blocks with the building
blocks approved in the Authority’s Final Decision.
The key changes relate
to the inflationary gain and return on capital base (reflecting a reduction in
forecast inflation and increase
in the real rate of return) and taxation
(reflecting an adjustment to the opening tax asset base).
reproduced at par 220 of the final decision is the Total Revenue Building
Blocks in nominal dollars, not real dollars as described
in that paragraph.
is apparent from the information contained in those paragraphs of the final
decision that the quantum of the ERA’s approved
Revenue Building Blocks
($1,844.53 million in nominal dollars) was an increase over the quantum
assessed in the ERA’s draft
decision ($1,762.18 million in nominal
dollars) but a decrease over the amount claimed by the owners
($2,210.04 million).

In its Draft Decision the Authority did not accept
DBP’s approach for estimating the rate of return and determined its own
The Draft Decision noted that, as provided in the
Final Decision on Proposed
Revisions to the Access Arrangement for the Mid-West and South-West Gas
Distribution Systems
(hereafter, the
ATCO GDS Final Decision
published as amended on 10 September 2015, [Economic Regulatory Authority,
Final Decision on Final Decision on Proposed Revisions to the Access
Arrangement for the Mid-West and South-West Gas Distribution
amended 10 September 2015] the Authority had recently modified its approach
to estimating the return on debt and the return on
equity as outlined in the
Authority’s Rate of Return Guidelines [Economic Regulation Authority, Rate
of Return Guidelines,
16 December 2013].
The Authority considered that the modified approach aligned with the regulatory
requirements for the rate of return as specified
in the National Gas Law
) and National Gas Rules (
). The Authority considered
DBP’s proposal for estimating the rate of return, but was not convinced
that it met the requirements
of either the NGL or the NGR.
The detailed reasoning for the Authority’s Draft Decision is set out in
Appendix 4 and is summarised below. The Authority:
continued to estimate the rate of return based on the debt proportion of total
capital – the gearing - for the benchmark efficient
entity of 60 per cent;
with regard to the estimate of the return on equity:
- retained the
Sharpe Lintner Capital Asset Pricing Model (SL-CAPM) as the primary relevant
model for estimating the return on equity;
information from other relevant models – including the Black Capital Asset
Pricing Model (Black-CAPM) and the Dividend
Growth Model (DGM) – to
establish the value of parameters in the Sharpe Lintner CAPM;
- estimated the
risk free rate parameter for input to the Sharpe Lintner CAPM from Commonwealth
Government Securities, based on a
5 year term to maturity;
- estimated a
range for the 5 year forward looking Market Risk Premium (MRP) based on historic
excess return data and the DGM, in
recognition that it fluctuates in response to
prevailing conditions;
- drew on a
range of forward looking information to establish the point value of the MRP;
- estimated the
beta parameter based a benchmark sample of Australian firms with similar
characteristics to the benchmark efficient
with regard to the estimate of the return on debt:
- continued to
estimate the cost of debt as the sum of the risk free rate, relevant Debt Risk
Premium (DRP), and relevant debt raising
and hedging transactions costs;
- estimated the
risk free rate from the bank bill swap rate with the same term as the regulatory
period, that is, 5 years;
- adopted a
hybrid trailing average approach to estimating the return on debt, with the risk
free rate estimated once, just prior
to the regulatory period, and the DRP
estimated using an equally weighted 10 year trailing average;
- estimated the
DRP based on a BBB band credit rating, for a term of 10 years, using the
Authority’s enhanced bond yield approach
that included international bonds
issued by domestic entities (and for estimates of the DRP prior to the proposed
averaging period,
utilise the Reserve Bank of Australia’s credit spread
data for the BBB band); and
updated the estimate of the DRP using a set of specified automatic formulas.
The Authority’s resulting
estimate for the overall post tax nominal rate of return for its Final Decision,
for the 2016 calendar year, was 6.02 per cent:
expected 5 year return on equity was 7.28 per cent,
estimated as at 2 April 2015;
estimate for the return on debt for the 2016 calendar
year was 5.172 per cent, estimated as at 2 April 2015.
This rate of return was applied from 1 January 2016 to
31 December 2020 in the tariff modelling for the Draft Decision, in order to
tariffs for the Draft Decision.
The Draft Decision noted the
estimate of the rate return on
debt, would be updated in the Final Decision to account for DBP’s
nominated averaging period
for the 2016 estimate. The overall method for
determining that revised calendar year 2016 estimate would follow that for the
estimate set out in the Draft Decision. The resulting
estimated rate of return for 2016 would be applied in the tariff modelling
the Final Decision for 2016 to 2020.
The Draft Decision noted the 2017 to 2020 rates of return would then be
progressively annually updated through the remaining years
of AA4. The resulting
revised rate of return would be included in the relevant tariff variations which
occur in each calendar year.
The Draft Decision noted the process for implementing the annual update would be
as follows:
For each annual update for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Authority would
estimate the updated DRP following the relevant annual
averaging period,
recalculate the rate of return, and then notify DBP of the outcomes as soon as
practicable. This would allow DBP
to check the rate of return estimate, prior to
its incorporation in the proposed annual tariff variation to occur on 1 January
Following that notification, DBP would be required to respond on any issues as
soon as practicable, in order to allow the updated
DRP and rate of return
estimates to be finalised prior to submission by DBP of its proposed annual
tariff variation.
In the event that there was a disagreement on the DRP annual update estimate,
the Authority would work with DBP to ensure that any
misapplication of the
automatic formulas in Appendix 4G of the Draft Decision were corrected in a
timely manner.
a result of the reasoning and determinations summarised in those paragraphs, the
ERA required an amendment to the owners’
amended proposal in respect of
the Rate of Return.
owners did not accept the ERA’s proposed amendment. The ERA then
determined its own numbers which it then recorded in Table
71 on p 221
of the final decision. That table is in the following form:
line items under challenge by Ground 1 of the owners’ grounds of
review are the 0.7 figure for equity beta and the second
last and third last
line items in Table 71.
addition, it is worth noting at this point that the second ground of review (the
gamma ground) relates to the fourth last line
item in Table 71, with
particular reference to the figure in the last column (0.40).
detailed reasoning of the ERA in relation to its ROE decision is found in
Appendix 4. Appendix 4 is itself a lengthy document
(233 pages).
pp 2 to 10 (pars 7 to 42) of Appendix 4, the ERA summarised the
terms of the owners’ original proposal in respect of the
rate of return.
At pars 41 and 42 of Appendix 4, the ERA said:
In revisions to the Access Arrangement, DBP proposed an
allowed post tax nominal rate of return for the benchmark efficient entity
8.36 per cent (as at 30 September 2014).
With debt gearing of 60 per cent, DBP’s proposed nominal rate of return
was a weighted average of:
a return on equity of 11.71 per cent; and
a return on debt of 6.13 per cent.
pp 10 to 13 (pars 43 to 60), the ERA described its response to the
owners’ original proposal as reflected in its draft decision.
pp 11 to 12 (pars 51 to 53), the ERA said:
The following conclusions were reached in relation to
the approach for estimating the return on equity in the Draft Decision for
The SL-CAPM should be utilised to estimate the return on equity.
The Fama French three factor model is not relevant and as such, this model
should not be used for the purpose of estimating a return
The Black CAPM is relevant for the purpose of estimating a return on equity.
However, given it is not reliable and practical to
estimate a robust return on
equity using this model, the model will not be used directly, but only to inform
the point estimate of
the equity beta from within its range for input to the
The DGM is a relevant model for informing the market return on equity and also
the forward looking MRP.
Other information such as historical data on equity risk premium; surveys of
market risk and other equity analysts’ estimates
are also relevant for the
purpose of estimating the MRP and the market return on equity. This other
material should be used as a
cross check for the return on equity.
Given that the only robust model for estimating the
return on equity in the Australian context is the SL-CAPM, the Authority did not
see any current need for data sourced from the SIRCA SPPR database, as suggested
by DBP [DBNGP Transmission Pty Ltd, Proposed Revisions
DBNGP Access Arrangement,
2016 – 2020, Rate of Return, Supporting Submission: 12, 31 December
2014, p. 55]. The SPPR database
was required by DBP to form long time series of
predictions for the model adequacy test [This need for a long time series was
one of the weaknesses of the model adequacy test (Appendix 4B), one
which can be circumnavigated by various approaches to cross-validation
4Bi)]. As need for the model adequacy test was rejected, then so too was need
for the SPPR database.
The Authority remained of the view that its reasons for adopting the SL-CAPM are
sound. The Authority considered that its application
of the SL-CAPM meets the
requirements of the NGR, and the allowed rate of return
The Authority did not agree with DBP’s submission that it had not taken
all of the relevant information into consideration
with respect to its estimate
of the return on equity. The Authority was of the view that all of the issues
raised by DBP and its
consultants were considered in the Draft Decision.
The Authority also disagreed with DBP’s estimates of the rate of return
on equity. The Authority conducted significant research
into the rate of return
and cross checked its estimate across various sources. The Authority’s
estimate for the rate of return
was in line with other industry estimates.
The Authority considered that the estimated return on equity adopted in the
Draft Decision was commensurate with the equity costs
incurred by a benchmark
efficient entity with a similar degree of risk as DBP with respect to the
provision of reference services.
The Authority therefore considered that the
estimated rate of return meets the allowed rate of return objective and the
requirements
of the NGR and NGL.

substance of the owners’ response to its draft decision.
Its references

owners’ response by way of further
submissions (see, in particular,
pp 30 to 32 (pars 146 to 156)).
pp 15 to 16 (pars 69 to 78) of Appendix 4, the ERA summarised the
owners’ responses in the following terms (references to
‘betastar’ being references to an algebraic formula adjustment
propounded by the owners):
Return on equity
In response to the Draft Decision, DBP submits only a slightly amended approach
to estimating the return on equity, as compared to
that put forward in its
initial proposal.
, DBP updates its range of outcomes for the return on equity from
its model adequacy test. This delivers a so-called ‘unbiased’
betastar range of 1.00 (25th percentile) to 1.70 (99th percentile), around a
mean of 1.15 [A footnote to this sentence stated that
DBP have revised slightly
the betastar estimates to reflect a change in the benchmark efficient entity
sample set. The revised sample
set reflects the omission of Envestra and HDF,
which are now both delisted from the ASX DBP states (DBP,
Proposed Revisions
DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period Supporting
Submission:
24 February 2016, p. 97): We note in Appendix
4A(ii) that the ERA has dropped Envestra and HDF from its original sample set as
are now dead stocks. We are unclear as to why it did not do this at its
last estimation; Envestra was trading until September 2014,
but HDF ceased
trading in November 2012, a year before the ERA undertook the beta calculations
in its Guidelines. The ERA has not
explained this change in stance.].
, the resulting range for the return on equity, when the betastar
range is applied within the SL-CAPM, is between 9.9 per cent and
14.82 per cent.
This result builds on DBP’s estimate of the 10 year risk free rate, of
2.87 per cent, and its estimate of the
Market Risk Premium (
, DBP also utilises information from the return on debt to derive
the final range of the return on equity, drawing on the insights
of Merton. DBP
considers that this ensures consistency between the return on debt and the
return on equity. Based on its analysis,
DBP argues that the range of the return
on equity should be between 10.61 per cent and 11.06 per cent. This range is
narrower, lying
entirely within the range given by the betastar estimates. DBP
then takes the midpoint estimate of the narrower range, which is 10.84
to be the best estimate of the return on equity.
In arriving at this position, DBP considers that two issues are central to the
differences between DBP and the Authority, which are
reflected in their
respective approaches to the return on equity.
, DBP is of the view that the Authority has not made a proper
assessment of its betastar approach. DBP contends that the Authority
its conclusions on superficial reasoning and irrelevant evidence, while ignoring
relevant evidence. DBP submits that the
Authority fails to make a proper
application of the evidence which itself had produced in relation to the
identification or quantification
of bias within the SL-CAPM.
, DBP argues that the Authority did not test whether the outcome of
its SL-CAPM approach to estimating the return on equity meets
Rule 87(5). DBP,
on the other hand, considers that it does this through the use of its model
adequacy test. DBP also contends that
the need to test outcomes as well as
inputs is a fundamental aspect of the regulatory framework in the NGL and
DBP maintains substantially the same approach to determining the return on
equity in its initial Access Arrangement Proposal; that
is, the application of
its ‘model adequacy test’. DBP considers that this tests the outputs
of models, and whether they
give rise to a range of unbiased outcomes; such that
the model results then neither systematically overstate nor understate actual
DBP notes that one of the amendments from the Authority requires the DBP to
implement the SL-CAPM using the five-year risk-free rate
and a beta of 0.7,
along with the estimate of the MRP. DBP argues that the first two could be done,
but not the third. This problem
arises because the Authority’s estimate of
the MRP changes at each regulatory decision, based upon how it interprets a
of “forward looking” indicator variables. DBP considers that
the Draft Decision fails to outline the ERA’s methodology
for quantifying
the correlation between changes in these variables and the change in the MRP.
DBP’s reasons for rejecting the Authority’s views on relevant
asset valuation models
DBP submits that the Authority accepts that the Black CAPM, dividend growth
model (DGM) and SL-CAPM are relevant in principle, as
it does. However, a key
difference arises with respect to the Fama-French model (
considers it to be relevant in-principle (based on the advice of CEG) but the
Authority does not.
p 17 (par 83), the ERA recorded the owners’ submission that the
notion that the SL-CAPM is biased downwards is hardly a new
idea, noting that
the ERA accepted that this downward bias exists when it chose 0.7 for beta,
while specifically acknowledging that
it was doing so in order to address the
issue of bias. In the same paragraph, the ERA noted the owners’
submission that the
model adequacy test utilised by the ERA produced results
that no-one else had found suggesting that the ERA’s view was contrary
more than 40 years of empirical finance.
ERA acknowledged that the owners had submitted that there was a need for an
empirical test of outputs. The ERA also understood
that the owners had
submitted that there was no proper basis for the ERA’s rejection of the
model adequacy test.
p 26 (pars 124 to 126), the ERA recorded the owners’ submissions
in the following terms:
Reasons for maintaining betastar
DBP considers that the Authority’s approach, given a finding of downward
bias for low beta stocks in the SL-CAPM, is completely
irrational. DBP argues
that [DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access
Arrangement Period Supporting
Submission: 56, 24 February 2016, p.
... the ERA is acknowledging that bias
exists, acknowledging that different models can supply information which might
the bias, but then explicitly rejecting any information from those
models in order to solve the bias problem in order to satisfy
itself that it is
not deviating from the SL-CAPM in any material
DBP is of the view that its betastar adjustment is
transparent and can be easily followed by any observer [DBP, Proposed Revisions
DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period Supporting
Submission: 56, 24 February 2016, p. 55].
DBP agrees with the Authority’s view that there are no literature or
empirical studies which use a betastar approach. DBP accepts
that it fails to
provide a single reference to support its view that betastar is well
established, or at least follows any standard
economic or statistical theories.
However, DBP argues that [DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016
– 2020 Access
Arrangement Period Supporting Submission: 56, 24 February
2016, p. 55]:
This, however, is not surprising; in the
ordinary course of events, if the Black CAPM passed a test like the model
adequacy test but
the SL-CAPM did not, one would simply have used the Black
CAPM. However, betastar was adopted so as to minimise departure from the
Guidelines.
p 28 (pars 134 to 137), the ERA recorded the following:
In its response to the Authority’s Draft Decision in relation to the
estimates of equity beta, DBP submitted that it has no
issue with the
of beta as undertaken by the Authority [DBP, Proposed
Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period
Supporting Submission: 56, 24 February 2016, p. 63].
However, DBP considered that there are two issues in respect of the
Authority’s beta, including: (i) The
of beta the Authority
has used of 0.7 produces a result which is not consistent with the approach it
has used in the past, because
it has failed to take into consideration the
changes in its beta
; and (ii) a potential issue concerning the
efficiency of the market portfolio.
, DBP argued that as the confidence interval around beta has shifted
upwards, the Authority’s choice of beta has not changed
[DBP, Proposed
Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period
Supporting Submission: 56, 24 February
2016, p. 64]. DBP considered that
systematic risk is measured relative to the market and one would expect change
as either the actual
risks facing the firm changed or risks in the market
changed. DBP was of the view that a consistent regulator would also choose a
point two basis points below the upper end of the same confidence interval to
address the same bias issue. As such, DBP argued that
doing so would require the
Authority to adopt the estimate of equity beta of 0.79 [DBP, Proposed Revisions
DBNGP Access Arrangement
2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period Supporting
Submission: 56, 24 February 2016, p. 64].
, DBP submitted that if the market portfolio is inefficient, then
the SL-CAPM fails to hold, and the conclusions the Authority has
respect of beta are wrong. DBP argued that, more importantly, DBP concluded that
[DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement
2016 – 2020 Access
Arrangement Period Supporting Submission: 56, 24 February 2016, p.
DBP is to show that the predictions made by
an SL-CAPM predicated on an inefficient market portfolio are downward-biased
of the actual returns made firms with (imperfectly measured)
systematic risk similar to (likewise imperfectly measured) systematic
exposure to the benchmark efficient firm, whilst the Black CAPM does not produce
downward-biased estimators.
pp 32 to 189 (pars 157 to 189), the ERA explained its reasoning in
respect of the Rate of Return which it proposed to adopt for
the purposes of its
final decision.
pp 32 to 33 (par 157), the ERA said that it did not accept the
owners’ proposed approach for estimating the rate of return,
approach does not comply with the regulatory requirements for the rate of return
as specified in the NGL and NGR. The ERA
said that, in evaluating the
owners’ amended proposal, it had drawn on previous positions set out in
the Rate of Return Guidelines,
prior decisions, the draft decision and the
owners’ response to the draft decision.
ERA commenced its consideration of the issue of Return on Equity at p 50
(par 240). At pp 50 to 52 (pars 240 to 244), the ERA
Return on equity
In line with the requirements of NGR 87(5), the Authority evaluated the
relevance of a broad range of material for estimating the
return on equity in
the Rate of Return Guidelines, covering relevant estimation methods, financial
models, market data and other
evidence [A footnote to this sentence referred to
the Australian Energy Market Commission, Rule Determination: National Gas
(Price and Revenue Regulation of Gas Services) Rule 2012, 29 November
2013, p. 36].
The Rate of Return Guidelines set out that the Authority will utilise a five
step approach for estimating the return on equity.
The five steps are
summarised in Figure 2 below.
In applying this approach, the Authority has assessed a wide range of material,
and identified relevant models for the return on
equity, as well as a range of
other relevant information. For this Final Decision, the Authority has had
regard to and given weight
to relevant material, according to its merits,
seeking to fully achieve the requirements of the allowed rate of return
204 The Authority considers that the
- ‘approach’ refers to the overall framework or method for
estimating the return on equity, which combines the relevant
estimation methods,
financial models, market data and other evidence;
- ‘estimation material’ refers to any of the relevant estimation
methods, financial models, market data and other evidence
that contribute the
‘approach’; and
- ‘estimation method’ relates primarily to the estimation of the
parameters of financial models, or to the technique
employed within that model
to deliver an output.
The Authority in the Rate of Return Guidelines
determined that only a subset of the material evaluated at that time could be
relevant in the Australian context, given the allowed rate of return
objective. The Authority remains of the view that:
Rate of return estimate materials –
the estimation methods, financial models, market data and other evidence –
to be broadly consistent with the requirements of the NGL, the NGO,
the NGR and the allowed rate of return objective to be considered
relevant. Some
estimation materials may perform better on some requirements and less well on
others, and yet may still be considered
relevant. Accordingly, the assessment is
whether, on balance, estimation materials are consistent with the requirements
of the NGL,
the NGO, the NGR and the allowed rate of return objective.
Nevertheless, estimation materials would need to pass a threshold of adequacy to
be considered relevant. To the extent that estimation
materials failed the
adequacy threshold, then they would be rejected. This rejection would be
consistent with the AEMC’s purpose
for the guidelines [Australian Energy
Market Commission, Rule Determination, National Gas Amendment (Price and Revenue
of Gas Services) Rule 2012, 29 November, p. 58]:
In order for the guidelines to have some purpose and value at the time of the
regulatory determination or access arrangement process,
they must have some
weight to narrow the debate.
Once over the threshold for adequacy, then, as noted, any particular estimation
material may meet the requirements of the NGL, the
NGO, the NGR and the allowed
rate of return objective to a greater or lesser degree. With this in mind, the
criteria would then be
used as a means to articulate the Authority’s
evaluation of the estimation materials, in terms of how they performed in
the requirements of the NGL, the NGO, the NGR and the allowed rate of
return objective. In this way, the criteria are intended to
assist transparency
around its exercise of judgement [Economic Regulation Authority, Explanatory
Statement for the Rate of Return
Guidelines, 16 December 2013, p.
In that context, the following analysis provides the
Authority’s determination for this Final Decision of the return on equity
for the DBNGP benchmark efficient entity. The Authority considers that the
estimate is consistent with delivering an outcome that
meets the allowed rate of
return objective, as well as the NGL and NGR more broadly [The allowed rate of
return objective is set
out at NGR 87(3):
The allowed rate of return objective is that
the rate of return for a service provider is to be commensurate with the
efficient financing
costs of a benchmark efficient entity with a similar degree
of risk as that which applies to the service provider in respect of the
provision of reference services].
ERA then moved through the steps depicted in Figure 2 which is set out at
p 51 (par 242) and explained its approach at each of
those steps.
referring to the Rate of Return Guidelines, the ERA then moved to consider the
approach which it had adopted in its draft decision.
pp 55 to 56 (pars 252 to 255) of Appendix 4, the ERA recorded its
opinion, reflected in its draft decision, that the SL-CAPM and
the Black CAPM
are both relevant models for estimating the return on equity. However, the ERA
took the view that it was not appropriate
for it to regard the Black CAPM as
suitable for use directly for estimating the return on equity. The ERA
concluded that the owners’
proposed betastar method had significant
empirical flaws. These flaws were summarised at pp 55 to 56 (par 253)
as follows:
the zero beta
portfolio is sensitive to the data set used, highly variable through time with a
wide standard error, and is therefore
not robust [Economic Regulation Authority,
Draft Decision on Proposed Revisions to the Access Arrangement for the Dampier
Natural Gas Pipeline, 22 December 2016, Appendix 4, p.
- DBP’s estimates – which use a
single average estimate of zero beta premium – disguise the significant
instability
of the Black CAPM model;
- DBP’s model adequacy test is selective in its interpretation of the
Black CAPM model;
the betastar approach does not produce sensible results [Economic Regulation
Authority, Draft Decision on Proposed Revisions to
the Access Arrangement for
the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline, 22 December 2016, Appendix 4,
- the indicative overall market return on
equity for a long period, estimated at the time of the Draft Decision, was
approximately
10.83 per cent, [Economic Regulatory Authority, Final Decision on
Proposed Revisions to the Access Arrangement for the Mid-West and
South-West Gas
Distribution Systems, as amended 10 September 2015, p. 255] which is lower than
DBP’s estimated return for low
asset beta entities such as the DBP;
- DBP is therefore suggesting that its return on equity is more risky than the
market as a whole;
- but this is not sensible on conceptual
addition, the ERA did not accept the owners’ model adequacy test for the
reasons set out at p 56 (par 254) of Appendix 4.
Those reasons
relying on the
historical data alone – as DBP does – for testing the relative
adequacy of the Authority’s approach,
is erroneous;
other forward
looking information needs to be taken into account, as the Authority does in its
approach to estimating the return
that DBP’s model adequacy approach does not actually test the
Authority’s approach in using the SL-CAPM for
estimating the return on
DBP in essence
compares two models that are not robust in the Australian context (the Black
CAPM and FFM) with another method that
is not relied on either – an ex
post SL-CAPM with an MRP that is based on historic data only.
ERA then moved on to address the owners’ response to the ERA’s draft
decision. It noted that the owners continued
to seek to apply its model
adequacy test to determine the relevance of models for the return on equity. On
this occasion, the owners
tested the outputs of three models – the
SL-CAPM, the FFM and the Black CAPM – in terms of their ability to predict
) market outcomes. The ERA noted that the owners had
submitted that only the outcomes of the Black CAPM provide for unbiased
of the return on equity whereas the results from the other two models
are considered to be biased and hence poor forecast predictors.
noted by the ERA, the owners then transformed the two percentile Black CAPM
outcomes into
estimates, for use in the SL-CAPM,
as a means to estimate an unbiased range for the return on equity. The ERA
noted that the owners
narrowed the return on equity range using the so-called
“Merton framework”
cross check method, before choosing the
mid-point as the resulting return on equity.
p 57 (pars 260 to 262) of Appendix 4, the ERA said:
Consequently, the core of DBP’s proposal relates
to the model adequacy test, the associated inference that only the Black CAPM
leads to unbiased results for the return on equity, and the use of the betastar
transformation so as to implement the results of
the Black CAPM within the
framework of the SL-CAPM. DBP’s claims with regard to the Merton framework
cross check method are
also key to its estimate.
The Authority considers these four elements of DBP’s response in turn
regarding the return on equity in what follows.
Further evaluation of DBP’s model adequacy test and application of
The Authority has significant concerns – both conceptual and empirical
– with DBP’s model adequacy test and betastar
transformation. The
following two sections set out the Authority’s reasoning regarding
DBP’s proposed approach from these
conceptual and empirical
perspectives.
the ensuing 30 pages or so, the ERA considered, in great detail, the conceptual
and empirical elements of the owners’ suggested
p 61 (par 278), the ERA concluded that there were significant issues
with the construct of the owners’ model adequacy test.
The ERA observed
that no method tests the ERA’s actual implementation of the SL-CAPM and
that all methods seek, erroneously,
to compare expected returns with
actual returns.
ERA then moved on to consider the question of whether there was bias in the
performance of the SL-CAPM or merely an anomaly.
pp 61 to 66 (pars 279 to 299), the ERA said:
Bias or anomaly?
DBP’s model adequacy test is intended to uncover ‘bias’ in the
performance of the SL-CAPM. DBP then makes an adjustment
to the beta in the
SL-CAPM, as a means to counter the perceived bias. That ‘betastar’
adjustment is based on the Black
CAPM, and is of the form [DBP, Proposed
Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement, 2016 – 2020 Regulatory Period, Rate of
Supporting Submission: 12, 31 December 2014, p. 68]:
However, it is not the beta in the SL-CAPM that is biased. As noted by Pink Lake
in its evaluation of the statistical properties
of the SL-CAPM and the Black
CAPM [Pink Lake Analytics, Statistical Advice to ERA on DBP Submission 56, May
2016, p. 4]:
Upon review it is clear that the positions
of the ERA and DBP are divergent. The Authority derives an RoE calculation from
[Henry, O.T., Estimating ��: An update, April 2014]
statistical version of the Sharpe-Lintner Capital Asset Pricing
Model (SL CAPM).
The statistical model itself is valid – in predicting the data it
minimises the squared error difference between
observations and model
predictions. Furthermore, the model includes a free intercept term in excess of
the risk-free rate (��),
so for its class of models (i.e., linear
models with a single predictor) it provides an unbiased estimate of
measure of an asset’s exposure to systematic risk in
the market. The ERA then omits the �� estimate of abnormal
from the Henry model in its implementation of the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM, deeming
these abnormal returns as not reflective of
the systematic risk in market prices
that is faced by benchmark efficient firms...
In contrast, DBP implements the Black CAPM model by first estimating a zero-beta
premium (ZBP). Effectively, this ZBP estimate is
a measure of the abnormal
returns in excess of the risk-free rate. As such, although the Black CAPM is
marginally biased in terms
of its predictions (as it does not include a free
intercept term) this bias is statistically insignificant. Where DBP and the
differ in their positions is that DBP include the full weight of the
ZBP, as a de facto measure of abnormal returns in their RoE
calculation...
Pink Lake has set out very clearly the mathematical
underpinnings of the two modelling approaches, so these are not reproduced here
[Pink Lake Analytics, Statistical Advice to ERA on DBP Submission 56, May 2016,
p. 4]. Pink Lake’s evaluation confirms that
the Authority’s estimate
of the SL-CAPM beta is not biased. However, by loading the betastar adjustment
into the SL-CAPM beta,
DBP biases the estimate of beta in its estimate. At the
same time, in so doing, DBP imports all of the deficiencies of its Black
into the resulting SL-CAPM estimate.
It is clear that DBP is mistakenly comparing one form of model (a model of
ex-post actual returns – the Black CAPM with a full
intercept term, where
the zero beta return captures all ex-post anomalies) with another form of model
(a model of ex-ante expected
returns – the SL-CAPM with no α
intercept included). As Partington and Satchell observe [Partington, G. and
S., Report to the ERA: The Cost of Equity and Asset Pricing Models,
May 2016, p. 34.]:
We need to be clear what unbiased means. If
it means that the DBP Black CAPM estimates, when subject to a model adequacy
test as proposed
by DBP, are such that the model adequacy test is not rejected,
then they are generally unbiased, at least with respect to the beta
portfolios.
However, this view of unbiasedness then gets translated into a view that the
regulator who uses the SL CAPM is providing investors
with approximately 4% per
annum less compensation. This treats low beta ex-post returns as equilibrium
returns. Here and elsewhere
in the document we take the view that the [SL-CAPM]
low beta anomaly is indeed an anomaly. The correct regulatory return would be
more sensibly based on subtracting the intercept term from [ex post SL-CAPM]
returns, not adjusting the slope and certainly not treating
the Black CAPM
(unbiased) returns as fair compensation. The more so since the SL CAPM industry
portfolios also pass the unbiasedness
It follows that if there is any ‘bias’
arising in the Authority’s estimate, that bias occurs with the
Authority’s
omission of the α intercept term from its statistical
estimation process. DBP in essence agrees with this point [DBP, Proposed
Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period
Supporting Submission: 56, 24 February 2016, p. 51].
...the only theoretical difference between
the SL-CAPM and the Black CAPM lies not in beta, but on the intercept... The
effect of this theoretical change is to shift the intercept of the
security market line upwards, and thus lessen its slope. This,
in turn, makes
the expected returns of low beta stocks higher and of high beta stocks lower
than predicted by the SL-CAPM.
This is important when considering the bias adjustments made by the ERA and DBP
(through its betastar model). The ERA, motivating
the “theory” of
the Black CAPM, changes beta, using a higher level of beta than the mean value
it obtains from its own
regressions. However, the theoretical change from the
SL-CAPM to the Black CAPM has nothing whatsoever with beta, it is a shift of
Pink Lake also recognises that the ‘low beta
bias’ issue relates to the interpretation of the intercept in the SL-CAPM
estimation process. Pink Lake points out that this makes the whole model
adequacy exercise redundant, in so far as it is testing
for beta bias [Pink Lake
Analytics, Statistical Advice to ERA on DBP Submission 56, May 2016, p.
For the Authority, the statistical model
employed is already an optimally fitting model under reasonable model
assumptions. Hence,
there is no reason to undertake further the model validation
proposed by DBP when adopting the Authority’s position. In contrast,
propose to apply the model validation to the RoE calculation itself. As the DBP
RoE calculation is essentially the same as their
statistical model, then it is
self-evident that their RoE calculation does not exhibit significant model bias.
Similarly, it is self-evident
that the Authority’s RoE calculation does
exhibit model bias, as it deliberately excludes the abnormal return component
in the Henry model in excess of the risk-free rate. Both the Henry
model and the Black CAPM are valid, depending on the position
being adopted. The
question of which position to accept - either the Authority’s or
DBP’s - is therefore not a statistical
question, but a question of
economics, and one that falls outside the scope and expertise of this
consultancy.
Consequently, the Authority now recognises that there is
no justification for changing the value of beta in the SL-CAPM. The further
implication is clear: DBP, by adjusting beta, is introducing a highly
significant bias into the beta estimate in its implementation
of the SL-CAPM.
The Authority considers DBP’s approach to be in error on this ground.
The case for an alpha adjustment
Having examined the implications of DBP’s arguments with regard to the
bias in the SL-CAPM, and rejected the case for any adjustment
to beta in the
SL-CAPM, the Authority now turns to consider whether there is any case to adjust
for α in the estimates derived
from the model tests.
The Authority considers that there is little compelling evidence about the
degree to which the α intercept term, or even part
of it, should be
A positive intercept in tests of the SL-CAPM does not automatically imply that
the Black CAPM applies. Positive intercepts (α)
in ex-post outcomes are not
automatically estimates of a zero beta premium [Partington, G. and Satchell, S.,
Report to the ERA: The
Cost of Equity and Asset Pricing Models, May 2016, p.
The theory of the SL-CAPM does not include the α term. Rather, the presence
of positive (or indeed, a negative value of) α
relates to differences
(so-called ‘anomalies’) between the
(or expected or
equilibrium) returns and
returns [Refer paragraph 265 for the
links between required, expected and equilibrium returns]. The Authority seeks
to ensure that
investors in the benchmark efficient entity obtain the required
return, consistent with NGR 87 (see paragraph 264). As Partington
and Satchell
observe [Partington, G. and Satchell, S., Report to the ERA: The Cost of Equity
and Asset Pricing Models, May 2016,
When prices are in equilibrium this required
return is equal to the expected return, but there is no guarantee that
expectations will
be realised, or that prices are always in equilibrium. If
there were a guarantee that expectations would be realised then the asset
have no risk.
Consistent with that view, the α intercept in
returns should be subtracted in its entirety, in order to
establish the required forward looking equilibrium returns [Partington,
Satchell, S., Report to the ERA: The Cost of Equity and Asset Pricing Models,
May 2016, p. 15:
This usual argument for the Black CAPM is
based on the premise that actual returns are equal to equilibrium returns on
average and
thus a positive intercept in tests of the SL CAPM are assumed to be
driven by the SL CAPM underestimating (overestimating) realised
returns for low
(high) beta stocks. An alternative premise is that the results are a consequence
of actual returns outperforming
(underperforming) equilibrium returns for low
(high) beta stocks. In the parlance of funds management such outperformance is
as alpha. Thus low beta stocks have positive alphas. In this case an
estimate of the equilibrium return is obtained by subtracting
alpha from the
actual return. Whether the resulting return is then higher or lower than the
regulated return is an open question
and will depend upon the magnitude of
For similar reasons, this subtraction of the intercept
term was employed by Henry, in estimating beta, and indeed the same subtraction
is adopted by the Authority in its updated estimates of beta for input to the
SL-CAPM [It is noted that the alphas in tests of the
SL-CAPM, based on beta
portfolio sorts, are not identical to the intercept term identified in the
Henry-style beta estimation process.
Nevertheless, they originate from the same
source – that is, from anomalous returns observed in the ex post
outcomes]. That
is, the intercept in excess of the risk free rate is ignored,
forcing the SL-CAPM security market line through the origin, consistent
theory of the SL-CAPM.
The Authority considers that there is no justification to ‘add back
in’ any alpha from the observed returns to the SL-CAPM,
where those are
simply differences, ex-post, as compared to the ex-ante required returns.
At the same time, the Authority is not convinced there is any empirical evidence
at the current time to justify an adjustment to
the SL-CAPM for expected alpha
for the benchmark efficient entity. As noted above at paragraph 265, theory
suggests that if such
an expectation was widespread among investors, it would be
bid away as part of a movement toward equilibrium asset pricing.
To examine this, the Authority turns to DBP’s own model adequacy test
results (even though, for the reasons stated above, the
Authority does not
consider the model adequacy approach a valid rationale for rejecting the
SL-CAPM). DBP’s own estimates indicate
that, based on industry sorts, the
model adequacy tests conducted by DBP tends to support the SL-CAPM. DBP tests
two versions of
the SL-CAPM – a vanilla version and an ‘ERA’
version, where it takes the 95th percentile beta of beta for each
– in two tables in Appendix D of its initial proposal [DBP explain this as
follows (DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP
Access Arrangement, 2016 – 2020
Regulatory Period, Rate of Return, Supporting Submission: 12, 31 December 2014,
Appendix D,
The results of tests of the SL-CAPM that use industry returns appear in Table 7
below while the results of tests of the ERA’s
version of the SL-CAPM,
which uses the 95th percentile of an estimate of the distribution of an OLS
estimator for beta rather than
an estimate of the mean of the distribution (the
OLS point estimate), appear in Table 8]. As noted by Partington and Satchell
[Partington,
G. and Satchell, S., Report to the ERA: The Cost of Equity and
Asset Pricing Models, May 2016, p. 21]:
Tables 7 and 8 from DBP [2015]... provide
statistics for the mean forecast error for the SL CAPM by industry. The
description in DBP’s
text says that the results of the ERA’s version
of the SL CAPM are in Table 8, whereas according to the title on Table 7 it
gives the ERA’s version of the SL CAPM. We think the latter is correct,
but fortunately, the labelling is of no real consequence
as there is relatively
little difference in the nature of the results between the two tables.
The results in Tables 7 and 8 generally are supportive of the SL CAPM. Across
the 104 tests in the two tables significant bias is
only observed with respect
to 3 industries. These are retailing, pharmaceuticals and utilities, which
provide six results significant
at the 5% level. With the exception of
retailing, these results are only significant for Method B. In short there is
very little
evidence of significant bias and the number of significant results
is approximately the number expected by chance. With a type 1
error of 5% we
would expect 5.2 of the 104 hypotheses to be rejected even if the null is true.
Thus finding only 6 rejections suggests
to us that the SL CAPM is supported by
these testing procedures.
The Authority agrees with Partington and Satchell that
the evidence in these tables is supportive of the SL-CAPM. This is particularly
the case for method A, which is the more relevant test (method B does not test
any form of expected return, as noted above). DBP
dismisses this, on the basis
that the industry tests are of low power. However, it is notable that
DBP’s argument relates to
the – in the Authority’s view
– discredited method B [DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement,
2020 Regulatory Period, Rate of Return, Supporting Submission: 12,
31 December 2014, Appendix D, p. 14]:
The low power of the tests is illustrated by
the fact that a Method B test of the null hypothesis that the ERA’s
the SL-CAPM provides an unbiased estimator of the return required on
a portfolio of utilities is unable to reject at the five percent
level the null
despite the mean forecast error associated with the estimator being 0.557
percent per month.
The Authority therefore is not convinced that there is
strong evidence from DBP’s analysis to reject the standard theoretical
form of the SL-CAPM.
The Authority now considers, given these insights, that there is inadequate
evidence, at this time, to justify departure from an
ex-ante alpha estimate of
zero in its implementation of the SL-CAPM:
a positive intercept in tests of the SL-CAPM does not automatically imply that
the Black CAPM applies;
the theory of the SL-CAPM does not include the α term; rather, the
presence of positive (or indeed, a negative value of) α
anomalies; and
DBP’s own estimates indicate that, based on industry sorts, the model
adequacy tests conducted by DBP tend to support the
On this basis, the resulting implementation of the
SL-CAPM becomes consistent with the theoretical form of the SL-CAPM: ex-ante,
SL-CAPM security market line is expected to pass through the zero intercept
on the y axis. If positive alpha was expected ex-ante,
prices would be expected
to adjust to restore equilibrium and an expectation of zero alpha (refer to
paragraph 265 above for this
rationale).
The corollary is that while the theoretical insights of the Black CAPM are
relevant – for example, for informing the theoretical
position of the
efficient market portfolio on the frontier in mean variance space in the absence
of a riskless asset – the
thorough exploration of this issue by the
Authority identifies that the empirical estimate of the zero beta return,
adopted by DBP,
contains a large measure of anomalous alpha, and hence
overestimates the required return. It is therefore not fit for purpose for
estimating the return on equity for the benchmark efficient
the reasons discussed by the ERA in the passages which we have extracted at
[179] above, the ERA expressed its views at p 65 (par
Appendix 4 in the following terms:
The Authority now considers, given these insights, that

a positive intercept in tests of the SL-CAPM does not automatically imply that

own estimates indicate that, based on industry sorts, the model adequacy tests
conducted by DBP tend to support the SL-CAPM.
ERA then moved on to discuss the relative acceptability of the SL-CAPM and the
Black CAPM.
discussion led to the conclusions expressed at p 69 (par 308) that it
was reasonable for the ERA to use the SL-CAPM and that
the Black CAPM could not
be relied upon.
ERA then moved on to discuss empirical elements of the owners’ return on
equity estimates.
referring to a number of reports and items in the financial literature (at
pp 69 to 84 of Appendix 4 (pars 309 to 369), at pp
(pars 370 to 382) the ERA said:
On that basis, DBP acknowledges that there is a reversal
of ranking of the Fama French model and the CAPM when the method of portfolio
formation changes.
Partington and Satchell note that the SL CAPM does not fare particularly well in
the Kan, Robotti and Shanken tests, although the
Inter temporal CAPM is a clear
winner. Their view is that the results of Kan, Robotti and Shanken show the
difficulty of all attempts
to fit asset pricing models to realised returns,
including the work of NERA/HoustonKemp [Partington, G. and Satchell, S., Report
to the ERA: The Cost of Equity and Asset Pricing Models, May 2016, p. 28].
The Authority notes the sensitivity of model performance ex post to model
specification and portfolio formation. This flags further
caution with regard to
the findings of DBP, as their work is based on a beta sort, rather than an
industry sort.
On balance, the Authority considers that there are still many unsolved issues in
relation to the estimates of the zero beta premium.
As such, the Authority
considers that DBP’s estimates – which use a single estimate of zero
beta premium – disguises
the significant instability in the model.
Therefore, the Authority does not consider that DBP’s model adequacy test
is empirically
true to the Black CAPM model.
The Authority notes that the unresolved issues in relation to the estimates of
the zero beta premium may explain why the Black CAPM
has never seen widespread
adoption by financial practitioners.
DBP’s model adequacy test produces nonsensical outcomes
The Authority notes that based on the findings from its model adequacy test, DBP
is of the view that the bias in its Sharpe Lintner
CAPM analysis is not only
statistically significant, but economically significant as well, with a mean
forecast error of around four
percentage points per annum. DBP considers that
this means that a regulator using the Authority’s approach to setting
would provide investors with returns that are four percentage points
lower than they could be earning by facing similar levels of
systematic risk
elsewhere in the economy [DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement, 2016
– 2020 Regulatory Period,
Rate of Return, Supporting Submission: 12, 31
December 2014, p. 60].
The implication of DBP’s finding is that the expected return on equity for
low beta assets, such as the ATCO GDS, the GGP and
the DBNGP, needs to be
increased by 4 percentage points, based on DBP’s analysis and conclusion.
For example, DBP argues that
the expected return for DBP or ATCO (a low asset
beta) using historical data on DBP’s model adequacy test should be 11.28
The Authority notes that the market return on equity for a long period is
approximately 10.3 per cent [See the section ‘Lower
bound of the MRP
range’ below for the Authority’s estimate of the long run historic
return on the market], which is lower
than DBP’s estimated return for low
asset betas such as DBP and ATCO. DBP is therefore suggesting that its return on
is more risky than the market as a whole. The Authority does not consider
that this view is sound.
There is conceptual support for the equity beta of an infrastructure network
benchmark efficient entity being less than 1:
business risk – which may be disaggregated into intrinsic (economic) risk
and operational risk – is the primary driver
of systematic risk, and this
risk is low for the benchmark efficient entity relative to the market
despite relatively high financial leverage, the benchmark efficient entity does
not have high financial risk – rather it is
the intrinsic risk of the firm
which is the key driver of systematic risk.
McKenzie and Partington endorse the view that the equity
beta is likely to be below 1, concluding that there is [McKenzie, Partington,
Report to the AER: Estimation of the Equity Beta (Conceptual and Regulatory
Issues) for a Gas Regulatory Process in 2012, April 2012,
...evidence to suggest that the theoretical
beta of the benchmark firm is very low. While it is difficult to provide a point
of beta, based on these considerations, it is hard to think of an
industry that is more insulated from the business cycle due to
inelastic demand
and a fixed component to their pricing structure. In this case, one would expect
the beta to be among the lowest
possible and this conclusion would apply equally
irrespective as to whether the benchmark firm is a regulated energy network or a
regulated gas transmission pipeline.
The Authority noted these views in its Draft Decision
and considered that the reasoning is relevant. This provided further support
the Authority’s view that DBP’s model adequacy test produces a
nonsensical results.
DBP took issue with this point, submitting the Authority has ignored standard
errors, has failed to take account of the expected
return on debt for high risk
firms in portfolio 9, and has overlooked that the return on equity can be below
the return on debt for
long periods [DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access
Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period Supporting Submission:
56, 24 February 2016, p. 42]. However, the fact that the return on equity can be
below the return on debt, ex post, simply amplifies
the point that ‘no
rational investor invests in shares expecting decades of negative real returns
ex ante, or expecting that
bonds will outperform equities, yet these were actual
outcomes. Thus differences between ex ante expectations and ex post outcomes
a major problem for tests of asset pricing models’ [Partington, G. and
Satchell, S., Report to the ERA: The Cost of Equity
and Asset Pricing Models,
May 2016, p. 7]. The Authority remains of the view that the outcomes for
portfolio 9 highlight the extreme
empirical problems of DBP’s
On balance, the Authority remains of the view that the findings of DBP’s
analysis are not robust and the approach produces
nonsensical
ERA then moved on to consider cross validation issues and the question of
consistency between debt and equity.
pp 93 to 96 (pars 425 to 443) of Appendix 4 the ERA expressed its
conclusions with respect to relevant models and information produced
ERA said that it had significant concerns with the owners’ estimate for
the return on equity – both conceptual
and empirical. In particular, the
ERA expressed the view that:
(a) the model
adequacy test approach, which sought to evaluate the forecasting power of
various models of the return on equity, was
not appropriate for the purpose of
estimating the return on equity for regulatory purposes;
‘betastar’ method (which was intended to transform the results of
the Black CAPM into the SL-CAPM) was fraught
with conceptual and empirical
problems and could not be relied upon to meet the requirements of the NGL (WA)
and the NGR because
(i) introduced
a full quantum of
anomalous returns into the SL-CAPM beta
(ii) thereby
introducing an adjustment for beta in the SL-CAPM which perversely introduced
significant bias into what is an unbiased
beta estimate; and
ill-posed in mathematical terms (that is, is increasingly distorted) as the
ZBP/MRP ratio approaches 1, raising serious questions
resulting return on equity;
(c) based on
the Black CAPM, the owners’ proposals suffered from the fact that
estimates of the zero-beta return are unstable
and cannot be relied upon in the
Australian context. As a consequence, the ERA was not convinced that the Black
CAPM is an acceptable
pricing model for estimating the return on equity, given
that the empirical implementation of the Black CAPM:
(i) is not robust. In contrast to the
risk-free rate, the expected return on the zero beta asset is unobservable and
there is no
apparent consensus on methods for estimating this return;
(ii) relies upon average zero beta return estimated over more than 20 years of
data, which typically results in estimates of the
zero beta return, and the
imputed zero beta premium, being less reflective of prevailing market conditions
than the risk free rate
estimates utilised in the SL-CAPM; and
(iii) is not widely used in practice. There is little evidence that other
regulators, academics or market practitioners used the
Black CAPM to estimate
the return on equity.
pp 95 to 96 (pars 437 to 443), the ERA said:
The Authority acknowledges that there is much debate
by the Authority in the Guidelines and Draft Decision, with reference to the
theoretical properties of Black CAPM. However, analysis
since, by the Authority
and its consultants, in response to DBP, has made the Authority concerned that
it would likely be making
a greater error by making an adjustment to the SL-CAPM
– through alpha – than by making no adjustment. The Authority
convinced such an adjustment would meet the allowed rate of return objective, or
the requirements of the NGO or the RPP.
Accordingly, the Authority has determined to retain the use of the
‘vanilla’ SL-CAPM for this Final Decision, with the
beta parameter
based on the central, best estimate. Further, in light of the foregoing, no
adjustment is made for alpha.
The Authority is satisfied that the resulting return on equity derived using the
SL-CAPM is consistent with the allowed rate of return
objective, and with the
other requirements of the NGL and NGR. The Authority considers that the
resulting SL-CAPM estimate for the
return on equity:
is reflective of economic and finance principles and market information;
is fit for purpose, which is reflected in its broad acceptance in the finance
industry as a means for estimating the cost of capital;
can be implemented in accordance with good practice;
is parsimonious, is not unduly sensitive to errors in inputs or arbitrary
filtering, and is therefore difficult to game;
uses input data that is credible and verifiable, comparable and timely and
clearly sourced;
is sufficiently flexible to allow for changing market conditions and new
information to be reflected in regulatory outcomes, as
appropriate.
In summary, the Authority determines the following for
the purpose of estimating a return on equity in this Final Decision:
The SL-CAPM will be utilised to estimate the return on equity.
The Fama French (three factor) Model is not relevant and will not be used for
the purpose of estimating a return on equity.
The Black CAPM is relevant for informing the theory of the return on
given it is not reliable and practical to estimate a robust return on equity
using this model, the model will not be used
- Neither is it
used indirectly. It is only used now to inform the theory of the return on
- A revised
consideration of the theoretical implications of the model makes clear that no
adjustment to equity beta is appropriate.
In addition, the Authority considers
that there is no compelling evidence to apply an alpha adjustment to the return
on equity determined
by the vanilla CAPM, as a means to account for ‘low
beta bias’ observed in ex post returns, at the current time.
The DGM is a relevant model for informing the market return on equity and also
the forward looking MRP.
Other information such as historical data on equity risk premium; surveys of
market risk and other equity analysts’ estimates
are also relevant for the
purpose of estimating the MRP and the market return on equity. In addition,
DBP’s primary cross-check
method is also accepted. This other material
will be used as a cross check for the return on equity.
The Authority remains of the view that its reasons for
adopting the SL-CAPM are sound. The Authority considers that its application
the SL-CAPM meets the requirements of the NGL and NGR, including the allowed
rate of return objective.
Accordingly, the Authority considers that the estimated return on equity adopted
in this Final Decision is commensurate with the
equity costs incurred by a
benchmark efficient entity with a similar degree of risk as DBP with respect to
the provision of reference
services. The Authority therefore considers that the
estimated rate of return meets the allowed rate of return objectives and the
requirements of the NGR and NGL.
In line with the requirements of NGR 87(5), the Authority has evaluated the
relevance of a broad range of material for estimating
the return on equity,
covering relevant estimation methods, financial models, market data and other
evidence for this Final Decision.
pp 97 to 98 (pars 446 to 458) of Appendix 4, the ERA set out its
reasoning as to why it had come to the view in the final decision
estimate of the equity beta for use in the SL-CAPM is not biased. Those
paragraphs are in the following terms:
Estimate of the equity beta
Following further evaluation of DBP’s betastar claims, set out above, the
Authority has determined that its estimate of the
equity beta for use in the
SL-CAPM is not biased. Accordingly, the Authority has determined that it will
not adjust beta in determining
the return on equity for this Final Decision. The
task then is to determine the best, central estimate of beta.
Under the CAPM, the total risk of an asset is divided into systematic and
non-systematic risk. Systematic risk is a function of broad
macroeconomic
factors (such as economic growth rates) that affect all assets and cannot be
eliminated by diversification of the investor’s
asset portfolio.
The key insight of the CAPM is that the contribution of an asset to the
systematic risk of a portfolio of assets is the correct measure
asset’s risk (known as beta risk), over and above the return on a risk
free asset.
In contrast, non-systematic risk relates to the attributes of a particular
asset. The CAPM recognises this risk can be managed by
diversification. Therefore, the investor in an asset does not require
compensation for this risk.
In the CAPM, the equity beta value is a scaling factor applied to the market
risk premium, to reflect the relative systematic risk
for the return to equity
of the firm in question, as compared to the systematic risk for all assets. Two
considered to determine a value of equity beta for
a particular firm: (i) the type of business, and associated capital assets, that
the firm operates; and (ii) the amount of financial leverage (gearing) employed
by the firm.
In the Rate of Return Guidelines, the Authority considered that empirical
evidence provides the best means to inform its judgment
for equity beta
[Economic Regulation Authority, Explanatory Statement for the Rate of Return
Guidelines: Meeting the Requirements
of the National Gas Rules, December 2013,
However, as discussed above (paragraphs 378 to 380, there is conceptual support
for the equity beta of an infrastructure network
benchmark efficient entity
being less than 1 [See for example Australian Energy Regulator, Draft Decision
Jemena (NSW), Attachment
3: Rate of return, November 2014, p. 3-235]. The
Authority noted these views in the Draft Decision and considered that the
is relevant [In the Draft Decision, the Authority noted DBP’s
view that model adequacy tests suggest that application of the
SL-CAPM is not
estimating what low beta firms ‘actually earn for their equity
investors’ (Dampier Bunbury Pipeline, DBP
Submission to ATCO Draft
Decision, 7 January 2015, p. 3). However, the Authority considers that the
evidence provided by DBP does
not accord with the well accepted theoretical
underpinnings of the CAPM, in that it suggests that as beta (systematic risk)
the equity risk premium increases. This raises significant issues for
the DBP empirical analysis, and the underlying quality of the
data that is used
for that analysis. Similarly, the Authority considers that the points made by
the ENA also refer to the same matters
(Energy Networks Association, WA ERA
Draft Decision for ATCO Gas ENA Response, 12 January 2015, p. 4). In particular,
the evidence
on the performance of SL-CAPM for low beta stocks evaluated by the
ENA’s consultant NERA utilises the same SIRCA database which
DBP (see NERA Economic Consulting, Estimates of the zero-beta premium, June
2013, p. 15). Furthermore, as a related point,
the Authority does not consider
that the four estimates cited by ENA are robust in the Australian context. At
the current time, the
Authority remains of the view that the conceptual
foundation of the CAPM supports the estimates of the return on equity set out in
this Final Decision.].
Nonetheless, the conceptual analysis does not provide sufficient grounds to
establish the point value of the equity beta. To inform
its decision on the
point value, the Authority conducted a detailed empirical estimation of the
required equity beta as part of the
development of the Rate of Return Guidelines
[Econometric analysis of beta was conducted in: Economic Regulation Authority,
Explanatory
Statement for the Rate of Return Guidelines, December 2013, Chapter
12. Justification and explanation for econometric techniques
was provided in
Economic Regulation Authority, Appendices to the Explanatory Statement for the
Rate of Return Guidelines, December
2013, Appendix 17, 22 and 23].
In its Guidelines, the Authority evaluated the following issues in relation to
the estimates of equity beta; including:
the level of imprecision for any empirically estimated value of the equity beta
[Economic Regulation Authority, Explanatory Statement
for the Rate of Return
Guidelines, 16 December 2013, p. 162.];
a range of other issues, including those relating to sampling and instability;
that it was inappropriate to include overseas businesses in the comparator
sample which was used to estimate the required equity
beta of the benchmark
efficient entity [Economic Regulation Authority, Explanatory Statement for the
Rate of Return Guidelines, December
2013, p. 188].
The Authority noted in the Guidelines that it would
update its estimate of beta at the time of each access arrangement decision
Regulation Authority, Explanatory Statement for the Rate of Return
Guidelines, 16 December 2013, p. 197].
For this Final Decision, the Authority will continue to estimate beta in the way
that was set out in the Guidelines, albeit updated.
Given the decision not to
adjust beta – as set out in ‘Step 1 – Identifying relevant
materials’ above –
the Authority adopts the best, central estimate
The Authority notes that DBP states that it has no issue with the
Authority’s revised estimates for beta that were set out
in the Draft
Decision [DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020
Access Arrangement Period Supporting Submission:
56, 24 February 2016, p. 63]:
In respect of beta, DBP has no issue with
the estimation of beta as undertaken by the ERA; when we use five years of
weekly, end-of-the-week
returns, we obtain roughly the same results the ERA
The Authority therefore takes DBP’s broad
acceptance of the beta material set out in the Draft Decision, apart from a
of issues which it raised in its response to the Draft Decision. For

First, the issue raised by DBP that the Authority's
Draft Decision estimate of beta, of 0.7, was not consistent with the approach
used in the past, refers to the Authority’s previous practice of adjusting
beta for so-called low beta bias. However, the Authority
indicated in the Rate
of Return Guidelines that it would review the evidence for beta adjustment
[Economic Regulation Authority,
Explanatory Statement for the Rate of Return
Guidelines, 16 December 2013, p. 162]. On the basis of the review set out in

support it making an adjustment to beta. Accordingly, the Authority
central, best estimate of beta for this Final Decision. DBP’s point has no
bearing on the central, best estimate,
as no adjustment is being made.
Accordingly, it is not considered further.
However, relevant to that central estimate, DBP raises the issue of a structural
break in the estimate of beta, around late 2014,
for rolling three year betas,
and for five-yearly betas in April 2012 (value-weighted portfolios) and
September 2013 (equal weighted
portfolios) [DBP, Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access
Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Access Arrangement Period Supporting Submission:

The changing confidence interval in the
ERA’s own analysis points to a deeper issue in respect of beta. That is,
beta appears
to be changing, and changing substantially, over the past twelve
months. Figure 5 provides a comparison of rolling three and five-year
the past several years.
However, it is not exactly clear what DBP’s point
Both beta calculations give roughly similar
results until around the end of October 2014. From the end of that date, both
trend upwards (as do the ERA’s results), but the three-year betas
trend upwards much more sharply. For a value-weighted portfolio,
the mean beta
estimate, before an adjustment for bias (like the ERA’s choice of 0.7 is
around 0.95) and, as CEG points out,
the lower bound of the 95 percent
confidence interval for a three-year beta is, at present, above the
bias-adjusted figure that the
ERA uses for
The Authority takes the point that the beta is changing,
and that there is then a question of the appropriate averaging period. The
Authority notes conflicting views on this topic. For example, SFG submitted to
the Authority that it considers it ‘implausible’
that equity beta
estimates could change over a two year period [ATCO Gas Australia, ATCO Gas
Australia’s Response to the ERA’s
Draft Decision, 22 December 2014,
Appendix 9.1, p. 9]. However, the rolling beta estimates produced by the
Authority in the Guidelines
convinced it that, for individual firms, the
relative sensitivity to systematic risk can vary quite dramatically [Only HDF
outside the estimated range]. The Authority has no reason to believe that
this does not reflect a re-rating by the market of the
respective firms, in
terms of risk relative to the market.
Therefore, the Authority considers there is no issue with the fact that the
measure of beta does change over time – that is
exactly why it undertook,
in the Rate of Return Guidelines, to update its estimate of the beta just prior
to its Final Decision [Economic
Regulation Authority, Explanatory Statement for
the Rate of Return Guidelines, 16 December 2013, p. 197]. That said, the
considers that five years provides an appropriate estimation period
which smooths out short term fluctuations in beta. The Authority
consider it appropriate to depart from its current practice, of placing emphasis
on the five year estimates, simply because
the data suggests that a higher
estimate of beta could be obtained by using a shorter averaging period.
Nonetheless, the Authority
notes that information.
Second, the Authority dealt with the issue of the efficiency of the market
portfolio at paragraph 324 to 326 above.
DBP also argued that the Authority's approach to selecting beta based on
confidence intervals is flawed. DBP argued that [DBP, Proposed
Revisions DBNGP

Response to Australian Competition

In essence, confidence intervals tell one
something about the precision of a parameter estimate (such as of beta) within a
given model.
However, it tells one nothing about the performance of that model
itself. A model can perform very poorly but still have very precisely
parameters. The issue of low-beta bias is not a problem in the estimation of
beta per-se. As DAA point out, that can be
improved simply by increasing sample
size. The issue is rather that the outputs of the model produce results which
are systematically

The Authority’s updated estimates of beta
for this Final Decision
The following Table 1 reports a range of estimates of Australian infrastructure
betas from various sources, with an emphasis on the
most relevant and recent.
: The AER’s Draft Decision for ActweAGL Distribution
Determination, Table 3-55, page 3-262 and the ERA’s 2015 study (Economic
Regulation Authority,
Draft Decision on Proposed Revisions to the Access
Arrangement for the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline,
22 December
2016, Appendix 4Aii, p. 233 – 234.
The detail of the Authority’s 2015 study set out in the table was reported
at Appendix 4Aii of the Draft Decision.
The Authority noted in the Draft Decision it considered that the 95 per cent
confidence interval for the beta estimate was 0.3 to
0.8 [Economic Regulation
Authority, Draft Decision on Proposed Revisions to the Access Arrangement for
the Dampier to Bunbury Natural
Gas Pipeline, 22 December 2016, Appendix 4, p.
52]. The Authority then determined a point estimate for beta at 0.7, allowing
some adjustment towards the top end of the range to account for the theory
underpinning the Black CAPM.
DBP contends that the Authority's approach to calculating averages has the
effect of artificially lowering the range for beta and
does not accord with the
Henry approach considered by the Tribunal. DBP states
Specifically, the ERA makes four estimates
for the individual firms and then two different portfolio estimates. The upper
bounds of 0.81 and 0.41 (respectively) are formed by averaging across
the six upper bounds of confidence intervals for the LAD regression
and the six lower bounds of the LAD regression estimates (the LAD estimates
exhibit the widest range - see DDA4 Table 29,
page 194). By contrast, Henry
(2014) does not mix portfolio and individual estimates in this way, and reports
his ranges as the minimum
and maximum of the confidence intervals for each set
of regressions, rather than the averages across lower and upper bounds.
Three of the four firms examined by the ERA (APA, AST and SKI) give similar
results to the portfolio results, generally, but one
(DUET) gives results which
are substantially below the other three firms, and the portfolios. By forming
the averages in the way
that it has, the ERA has effectively given
disproportionate weight to DUET, and has dragged down its averages
accordingly.
The Authority accepts these points in principle, rather
than substance (there are issues with the numbers DBP quotes, and its subsequent
inferences). The Authority takes account of those points in what follows.
The Authority’s 2016 estimates
For this Final Decision, the Authority had Pink Lake Analytics further update
the beta estimates for this Final Decision, in part
to address the data issues
that had been raised by HoustonKemp [Pink Lake Analytics, Variance of the ZBP
estimator, June 2016, Appendix
G, p. 59]. The detailed results are reported at
Appendix 4A, with a key table reproduced here (Table 2).
Drawing on the results reported in Appendix 4A, the Authority considers that a
95 per cent confidence interval range of equity beta
using the most recent data
is from 0.479 and 0.870 based on the portfolio results (see Appendix 4A, Table
21 and Table 22). The central
estimate given by the average of the portfolios is
0.699. The Authority notes that portfolio estimates have a narrower range than
the individual assets.
Based on its own analysis and the other evidence before it, together with the
recognition that estimates of equity beta from empirical
studies exhibit a high
level of imprecision, the Authority is of the view that the point estimate of
equity beta of 0.7 (rounded)
provides a conservative and appropriate central
best estimate for beta for use in the SL-CAPM.
Conclusions with regard to equity beta
Based on the above considerations, the Authority is of the view that available
Australian estimates of equity beta are reliable and
that the estimates from
these studies should be used to determine an appropriate equity beta for a
network service provider.
The Authority considers that available estimates of equity beta in Australia,
including Henry’s studies and the Authority’s
own analyses, as
presented in Table 1 and Table 2 above, as well as submission material from DBP,
indicate a best equity beta estimate
of (a rounded) 0.7. Rounding the estimate
to one significant figure accounts for the acknowledged imprecision of the
That estimate gives greatest weight to the Authority’s 2016 estimates of
equity beta – using data for the most recent
On balance, the Authority remains of the view that it is appropriate to account
for a range of evidence in its determination of the
equity beta point estimate.
Based on its considerations outlined above, the Authority has determined to
adopt the estimate of equity
beta of 0.7 for this Final Decision for the
conclusions expressed by the ERA at pp 100 to 103 (pars 467 to 478)

p 190 (par 915)) that the ERA engaged Pink Lake

The Owners’ Submissions

investments in them would be considered low risk by the

application of a
SL-CAPM will produce a
“downward bias”
in estimates of the return on equity for low beta stocks derived
from the SL-CAPM.

owners also submitted that the ERA’s
approach in the final decision
diverges materially from the approach of the AER which was considered by the
Tribunal in
PIAC and Ausgrid.
In that case, the Tribunal endorsed an
approach which used the SL-CAPM but selected the upper end of the derived range
for beta in
order to account for the potential for underestimation.
owners noted that, in the final decision, the ERA selected the
“central, best estimate”
for beta produced by the SL-CAPM
(having separately acknowledged that beta had increased significantly between
the date of its ROR
Guidelines of 2013 and the final decision in mid-2016) on
the basis that:
(a) any bias in
the SL-CAPM is not due to a bias in beta but is instead due to the fact that low
beta stocks have
“positive alpha”
and the SL-CAPM omits the
intercept term which records actual alpha, applicable to observe
(b) there was insufficient evidence, at this time, to justify an adjustment to
the SL-CAPM for expected alpha.
owners accepted that the proposition referred to at [203(a)] above may be
accepted as correct in general terms but that there
was reviewable error in the
second proposition.
owners claimed that the Tribunal should set aside the ERA’s decision in
relation to the return on equity because of the
error described at [203(b)]
above and remit that decision to the ERA to make it again in accordance with any
direction or recommendation
of the Tribunal. The owners did not put forward a
specific solution to the problems created by the alleged error committed by the

Previously,
the equivalent to r 87 required that the return on equity be determined
“a well accepted financial model such as the SL-CAPM”
Those words were removed when the new r 87 was promulgated. Regard must
now be had to relevant estimation methods, financial models,
market data and
other evidence. This approach was confirmed by the Tribunal in
at [650]–[651].
owners’ submissions and the final decision referred in detail to the
history of the interactions between the owners and
the ERA in relation to the
access determination under consideration here.
owners pointed out that, in its ROR Guidelines and in its draft decision, the
ERA had suggested an appropriate equity beta was
0.7. Ultimately, in its final
decision, the ERA used 0.7. The owners also pointed out that the reasons which
underpinned the selection
of 0.7 as the appropriate equity beta changed between
the time when the ROR Guidelines were first formulated and the date of the
submission is correct.
Explanatory Statement to the Rate of Return Guidelines
promulgated by
the ERA, the ERA described in its simplest form the components of the SL-CAPM as
the purposes of its ROR Guidelines, the ERA had formed the view that, of the
various models used for the calculation of the return
on equity, only the
SL-CAPM is relevant for forming the ERA’s estimate of the prevailing view
of equity for the regulated firm.
The ERA considered that other models were not
relevant within the Australian context at the current time, at least without
new developments in terms of the theoretical foundations or in the
empirical evidence. This was a view which the ERA maintained
throughout the
regulatory process in the present case. That approach was not criticised by the
submitted by the owners, however, the ROR Guidelines and the explanatory
documents published with them contained acknowledgements
from the ERA of the
existence of actual or potential downward bias in the SL-CAPM for low beta
stocks and of the need to adjust for
it. In those documents, the ERA purported
to make such an adjustment by determining a range for beta of 0.5–0.7 and
then selecting
a beta from the top end of that range (0.7). This method of
adjusting for the alleged bias was, according to the owners, well accepted
the time of the draft decision, the ERA had derived a different range for equity
beta. At p 57 (par 250) of Appendix 4 to the
draft decision, the
ERA said that it considered that a value of 0.8 would be excessive for a gas
distribution network such as the
pipeline here, with its highly diversified
demand base. Its selection of 0.7 was not the top of that range but rather
“towards the top”
of that range. That range was 0.3 to
Ultimately,
in the final decision, the range for equity beta had again increased. By
mid-2016, the 95% confidence interval range
for equity beta, using the most
recent data, was between 0.479 and 0.870. The central point estimate given by
the average of the
portfolios which fed into that range for equity beta was
0.6999. In its final decision, the ERA chose to round that central point
estimate up to 0.7 and to use that equity beta in the SL-CAPM.
essential error in the approach of the ERA is said by the owners to have been
its failure to make any adjustment for the well-accepted
proposition that
outcomes from the application of the pure SL-CAPM contain a downwards bias in
respect of low equity beta stocks.
As submitted by the owners, this was a
departure from the approach previously taken by the ERA in its ROR Guidelines
and also in
its draft decision which involved selecting an equity beta at the
top or very near to the top of the range under consideration.
owners submitted that it was accepted by both parties that it was not mandatory
for the ERA to apply its own guidelines when making
its final decision. It was
also accepted by both parties that the rule of thumb which efficiently adjusted
equity beta by selecting
as the appropriate equity beta the top figure in the
derived range, an approach which had been adopted in both the ROR Guidelines
in the draft decision, was a rough and ready way of accommodating the actual or
potential downwards bias in the outcomes produced
by the SL-CAPM in respect of
low equity beta stocks.
their submissions, the owners referred in some detail to the empirical work
which they had carried out designed to demonstrate
that the output of the
application of a pure or vanilla SL-CAPM systematically underestimated equity
betas for low income stocks
when a comparison is made between the actual
performance of those stocks over a period of time and the assumptions contained
SL-CAPM designed to reflect the investors’ expectations with
respect to returns on their investments in such stocks. We pause
to note that
it is not necessary for us to delve into the work in this regard that was
carried out by the owners and submitted to
the ERA as the owners did not contend
before us that the ERA’s decision not to accept the validity of the work
which the owners
had done and the approach which then deployed that work did not
constitute relevant error. In addition, the owners did not press
before us that
the betastar adjustment which was the subject of submissions to the ERA should
be accepted by us as the correct, proper
or only way of addressing the problem
of what, in the language of the submissions, came to be called low beta bias.
same may be said of the ERA’s rejection of the Black CAPM which records a
zero beta premium, something which is not found
in the pure or vanilla SL-CAPM
and which serves to, in effect, overcome the low beta bias or the high beta bias
by what is sometimes
called the flattening the security market line. The owners
accepted that, in the pure or vanilla SL-CAPM and in the Black CAPM,
beta is the same. As we have already mentioned, in the Black CAPM there is a
zero risk premium, which is identified by
the symbol α in the formula.
Making an adjustment to alpha, so the argument ran, is one way of addressing the
problem caused
by actual or potential low beta bias. There is no alpha in the
pure or vanilla SL-CAPM but there is an alpha in the Black CAPM.
oral argument, the owners accepted that applying the betastar model in effect
adjusted the SL-CAPM model relevantly so as to
make the result the same as the
result that would have been achieved had the Black CAPM model been applied. The
owners went on to
submit that, over a long period of time, the Black CAPM (or
empirical model) performed without bias whereas the SL-CAPM did not.
Nonetheless, the owners accepted that it was open to the ERA not to apply the
Black CAPM model in the present case. Indeed, they
accepted that they were not
“taking on that model
but rather were seeking
to replicate the impact of the model, had it been applied, in the present case.
owners submitted that the ERA committed an error when it declined to use
historical data in informing the required rate of return.
The submission was
that the only reliable way of checking the validity of the SL-CAPM was to
compare the assumptions made in that
model with the results achieved in fact.
owners also submitted that the ERA committed an error by using an unadjusted
SL-CAPM and effectively setting alpha to zero. The
owners submitted that this
led to a biased outcome and was unjustifiably inconsistent with the previous
approaches taken by the ERA.
their oral submissions, the owners (correctly) accepted that, when they used the
“a low beta bias”
, they meant to describe the
circumstance that the outputs derived through the SL-CAPM will produce returns
that are too low for firms
that have a low equity beta. It is the outcome which
will be biased downwards. It is not the beta integer itself that will be
owners relied upon the reasoning in
PIAC and Ausgrid
in which the
Tribunal held that it did not consider that the regulator in that case (the AER)
made an error of fact by selecting the
SL-CAPM as its foundation model. It
arrived at that holding being fully aware of the shortcomings of the SL-CAPM and
after a detailed
analysis of the relevant underpinnings. Ultimately, the
Tribunal also held that no error was made by the AER in selecting the upper
point of the range (in that case, 0.7) for the equity beta to be deployed in the
SL-CAPM. In the end, the Tribunal accepted that
PIAC and Ausgrid
there was evidence of a low beta bias but concluded that the way that the AER
had responded to that low beta bias did not reveal
owners submitted that the ERA had committed an error when it proceeded to derive
the figure for equity beta without making some
appropriate adjustment for the
alleged low beta bias. The source of that error was the ERA’s acceptance
that, on the evidence
before it, there was no proven alleged bias. The owners
submitted that that was illogical when proper regard was had to historical
and appropriate model testing. The owners accepted that one cannot investigate
and establish the validity of actual expectations.
However, they submitted that
the way that models are tested in the world of finance is to test them by
reference to outcomes
. This was a legitimate approach and one
which was permitted by r 87 of the NGR.
the present case, the owners did not go so far as to submit that the use of the
SL-CAPM, in and of itself, constituted an error
on the part of the ERA. The
complaint was that, if that model was to be used, it needed to be adjusted to
take account of the accepted
low beta bias. The owners submitted that the use
of the SL-CAPM without adjustment will inevitably produce a return that does not
meet the RPP under the NGL(WA).
owners submitted that even the expert retained by the ERA (Pink Lake) expressed
the opinion that it would be a legitimate exercise
of regulatory discretion for
the ERA to have selected the top of the range of equity betas when ultimately
making its decision because
both it and other regulators had taken that rough
and ready approach in the past. However, the owners accepted that making this
kind of adjustment to the output of the SL-CAPM was indeed
Counsel for the owners summarised the owners’ submissions in support of
Ground 1 at Transcript pp 61–63. In essence,
those submissions
(a) There was
no evidence before the ERA that, in the real world of finance, the SL-CAPM is
consistently deployed in its pure theoretical
(b) The SL-CAPM
is built on unrealistic assumptions in the sense that they involve expectations
of rates of return which are generally
not those which are actually
(c) There is a
long and widely held view that the SL-CAPM performs poorly in empirical
(d) There is a
long and widely held view that the SL-CAPM tends to underestimate returns for
low risk or low beta stocks. In the
past, and including in the ROR Guidelines
and in the draft decision in the present case, the ERA has sought to accommodate
beta bias phenomenon by selecting beta from the high end of the derived
(e) The Pink
Lake Report obtained by the ERA and upon which it relied did support the
proposition that addressing low beta bias by
selecting a beta from the high end
of the derived range is not necessarily the most principled way of dealing with
the phenomenon.
That is because low beta bias does not mean that estimations of
beta are biased downwards. It simply means that the results or
outcomes or
outputs produced by the SL-CAPM are biased downwards in that returns are too low
for low beta stocks;
(f) In light of
the above matters, the RPP and r 87 of the NGR require the ERA to address
the problem of low beta bias in some way.
It cannot do nothing. To do so is to
commit error. It must make an adjustment to the inputs of the SL-CAPM either by
the rough and ready approach reflected in its own guidelines or by
adjusting alpha;
(g) Taking no
action to adjust for low beta bias was an error. The problem had to be
addressed. The only two ways that immediately
come to mind are through an alpha
adjustment or by reverting to the common practice of adopting a beta from the
high end of the derived
range for equity beta;
(h) The ERA
committed reviewable error by not making some adjustment. In particular, it
preferred theory over reality. The returns
may be equilibrium returns insofar
as the model is concerned but they will be inadequate when assessed against
(i) The NGR do
not mandate that the return on equity must be the equilibrium returns identified
by the pure form of the SL-CAPM.
That may once have been the case, but, since
2013, with the relevant rule amendments, that is certainly not the case any
(j) Here, the
ERA has failed, one way or another, to deal with low beta bias with the
consequence that the return on equity that has
been derived is likely to be
insufficient to generate or to attract an efficient level of investment in the
network with a further
consequence that the ERA has failed to allow a rate of
return that achieves the allowed rate of return objective within r 87.
The ERA’s Submissions
ERA made detailed Written Submissions and oral submissions to the Tribunal. In
the succeeding paragraphs, we will endeavour to
summarise those
submissions.
ERA submitted that in determining the
“allowed rate of
(as to which, see r 87(4) and r 87(3) of the NGR)
regard must be had to:
(a) relevant
estimation methods, financial models, market data and other evidence;
desirability of using an approach that leads to the consistent application of
any estimates of financial parameters that are
relevant to the estimates of, and
that are common to, the return on equity and the return on debt; and
interrelationships between estimates of financial parameters that are relevant
to the estimates of the return on equity and
the return on debt.
ERA argued that the return on equity for an
access arrangement period
to be estimated such that it contributes to the achievement of the
rate of return objective
(as to which, see r 87(3)). In estimating the
return on equity under r 87(6), regard must be had to the prevailing
conditions in
the market for equity funds (r 87(7)).
PIAC and Ausgrid
, the Tribunal made a number of observations as
to the true interpretation of a rule in the NER which is equivalent to
r 87(5). In
particular, it addressed remarks to the correct application of
the equivalent rule to r 87(5)(a). The Tribunal said:
The relevant textual features, in the view of the
Tribunal, are the breadth and generality of the words “relevant estimation
methods, financial models, market data and other evidence”. They do not
suggest a prescriptive obligation to consider particular
methods, models or
data. If that were intended, one would expect it to be more prescribed.
Rather, it is left to the AER to decide
what is “relevant” and a
dispute about relevance is not itself a basis for asserting error of the
character now asserted.
In fact, the AER did have regard – in the sense
of considering – the material put forward by the Network Applicants.
same reasoning suggests that the obligation to “have regard to”
certain material is to consider it and to give it
such weight as the AER
decides. Again, if a more sophisticated obligation were intended, it is likely
it would have been differently
expressed. The main contextual matter indicating
the nature of the obligation is the regulatory framework where the RoR Objective
is as set out above. It, too, indicates that the requirement to have regard to
certain material is not prescriptive in the sense
argued for by the Network
Applicants. The RoR Objective is the general umbrella concept which the
prescribed process is to serve;
it would not serve it by requiring particular
weight to be given to particular materials. That conclusion is also supported
AEMC’s views referred to, which indicate that it is left to the AER
as the regulator to decide within the relevant Rules how
it arrives at a rate of
return which is robust and sensible and best achieves the RoR
referring to the ROR Guidelines, the owners’ proposals and the ERA’s
draft decision, the ERA made brief submissions
as to the import of its final
decision. In particular, it submitted (correctly) that it had concluded in its
final decision that
the owners’ model adequacy test had conceptual and
empirical flaws and was not suitable for assessing the ability of various
of the return on equity to estimate the prevailing return on equity required by
investors. The ERA also concluded that the
owners’ proposed betastar
transformation was unsuitable and determined to use the SL-CAPM as the primary
means of estimating
the return on equity.
ERA submitted that, in the course of evaluating the owners’ proposals, it
also reached the view that there was little evidence
that its estimate of beta
in the SL-CAPM led to a biased outcome. Even if an adjustment could be
justified, the ERA considered that
it should be applied to the intercept term in
the SL-CAPM, thereby taking account of the alpha term arising in
tests of the model. However, it was not convinced that there was adequate
evidence to justify such an adjustment.
ERA then noted that, for the above reasons, it had determined to use the
SL-CAPM, with the beta parameter based on the
central best estimate (0.6999) with no adjustment made for alpha.
result was that the ERA determined an indicative nominal after tax return on
equity of 6.98% giving a nominal after tax WACC of
ERA submitted that there were three prongs to the owners’ challenge to the
final decision in respect of ROE. The ERA submitted
that, according to the
owners, it made errors of fact that were material to the making of its decision,
and/or exercised its discretion
incorrectly, by:
(a) rejecting
the owners’ use of historical data to test the outcomes produced by asset
pricing models against actual returns
(b) using an
unadjusted SL-CAPM (with any estimation alpha ignored or set to zero); and
(c) misconstruing
“industry’s portfolios”
used by the owners as part
of their model adequacy test.
ERA submitted that it had not rejected the use of historical data in principle.
Rather, so it submitted, it rejected the owners’
methods which had been
applied to that data, by its model adequacy test and betastar adjustment,
because there were too many flaws
in those methods to be able confidently to
rely upon them.
ERA noted in its Written Submissions that, in reaching its decision to reject
the owners’ proposed use of historical data,
the ERA considered the
submissions lodged by the owners and others and relied upon advice from its own
experts (including, in particular,
the views of Pink Lake Analytics and
Professors Partington and Satchell).
pause to note at this point that the owners do not advance a case to the effect
that the ERA committed an error or errors by not
accepting the owners’
approach to historical data. In particular, the owners do not argue before the
Tribunal that the ERA’s
rejection of its betastar approach was, in and of
itself, a reviewable error (see, in particular, the concession made by Senior
for the owners at Transcript p 83 ll 29–34).
ERA submitted that, in the final decision, it had recognised the importance of
having regard to observable historical data in
determining the return on equity.
The ERA used peer reviewed and published historical return data, forward looking
data and other
relevant models (such as the Dividend Growth Model) when
considering the alternative methods for estimating the market risk premium
). However, as submitted by the ERA, the ERA was not convinced that
the approach advanced by the owners provided an effective test
of how well a
model estimates investor expectations in the
. The ERA considered
that the owners’ approach placed undue reliance on testing asset pricing
models using
realised returns.
ERA then made a number of submissions addressing well known issues associated
with using expected returns to test asset pricing
ERA submitted that actual returns can never be a proxy for expected returns
because such a proposition is conceptually unsound.
The ERA rejected the notion
that differences between actual and expected returns over an extended period
influence, or are believed
to influence, the rate of return demanded by
investors. Such an approach is not a standard approach in investment analysis.
must be remembered, so the ERA submitted, that asset pricing models are not
tools for forecasting actual returns.
the ERA accepted that some element of past returns performance might contribute,
at least to some extent, to investor expectations
for the future, it made the
point in its submissions that it is not aware of any reliable empirical measure
of the degree to which
its investor expectations are influenced by such
historical data. The owners did not bring forward any such measure.
ERA noted that the owners had submitted that its approach materially differed
from the approach of the AER which had been endorsed
by the Tribunal in
and Ausgrid.
So much may be accepted, so the ERA submitted. However, it
went on to submit that its different approach was amply supported by a
significant amount of other material, including the Partington and Satchell
report of 15 May 2016.
ERA submitted that, on review of this additional material, it was apparent that
there was much debate about whether an adjustment
needed to be made to the
SL-CAPM to account for
“low beta bias”
. The ERA ultimately
concluded that there was little evidence that its estimates of beta used in the
SL-CAPM were biased in the manner
alleged. It then observed that, to the extent
that there is any bias in the SL-CAPM, it is more likely to be due to the
of the alpha intercept term of the SL-CAPM. However, on the evidence
available, the ERA concluded that no adjustment for alpha in
the estimates
derived from the SL-CAPM was justified.
Ultimately,
the ERA concluded that the available evidence did not justify the kinds of
adjustments which were urged upon it by the
owners and that, were it to make
such adjustments, it would likely be making a greater error than by failing to
make any adjustment.
ERA submitted that the above conclusions expressed in its final decision
involved the exercise of regulatory judgment by the ERA
in deciding which
estimation models, financial models, market data and other evidence was relevant
and what weight to give to those
materials. The ERA did not err, nor was it
unreasonable, in reaching the conclusions which it did after having adopted such
an approach.
its oral submissions to the Tribunal, the ERA made a number of detailed
references to the Pink Lake Analytics report and to the
report of Professors
Partington and Satchell in order to demonstrate that the evidence allegedly
supporting the proposition that
the vanilla SL-CAPM contained a low beta bias
was not sustainable. It went on to submit that there was no statistically
significant
provable basis for that proposition.
difficulties in the owners’ approach were highlighted when, during the
course of the hearing, the owners propounded (in
MFI-2) the precise relief which
they now sought. That form of relief (if granted) required the ERA to make a
wholesale reassessment
of its conclusions in respect of return on equity and
ultimately the allowed rate of return within the meaning of r 87. The ERA
submitted that the Tribunal would never make an order in such general
ERA submitted that there was ample support in the May 2016 report from Pink Lake
Analytics and the report from Professors Partington
and Satchell for the
proposition that the so-called low beta bias in the SL-CAPM did not exist or, to
put the matter more accurately,
the evidence suggesting that such a bias existed
was not sufficient to justify the conclusion that such a bias actually
oral submissions, Senior Counsel for the ERA emphasised that the SL-CAPM was
never intended to incorporate assumptions as to investment
returns which bore a
close resemblance to reality. The assumptions to be fed into the SL-CAPM
involved making rational and justifiable
assumptions about investor
expectations. Necessarily, that exercise involves looking to the future. Past
performance would not
necessarily provide a useful guide to making an assessment
of such expectations.
ERA also reminded the Tribunal in oral submissions that not only did the owners
not now advance a case that error was committed
by the ERA in rejecting the
betastar model, but also they did not advance a case to the effect that
rejecting the Black CAPM constituted
a reviewable error or that adopting the
was such an error. In the end, the owners’ case
came down to two alleged errors: First, the ERA committed a reviewable error
failing to acknowledge and proceed upon the basis that the SL-CAPM had a low
beta bias. Second, having reached the conclusion
that the model contained such
bias, it committed errors in failing to adjust the SL-CAPM for that bias. The
only two potential adjustments
that were identified in argument before us were
“rough and ready”
approach of adopting as the equity beta
that beta which was at the top of the derived range at any given point in time
or adjusting
the alpha interceptor from zero upwards. The ERA submitted that,
even if the owners were correct in their submissions in respect
of those two
alleged errors, they did not undertake the task of establishing and plainly
failed to establish that the adjustments
for which they contended would, or
would be likely to, result in a materially preferable designated NGO
ERA submitted that, in relying upon the expert advice which it received from
Pink Lake Analytics and from Professors Partington
and Satchell, it did not
misunderstand the import of the opinions expressed by the authors of those
ultimate submission made by the ERA was that, far from failing to take account
of the burden of the owners’ responses during
the regulatory process, far
from proceeding upon false assumptions and far from misunderstanding the issues
concerning the need to
adjust the SL-CAPM, the ERA had devoted considerable
attention to the requirements of s 24 (in respect of the RPP) and r 87
not failed to apply that which was required by those
stipulations.
Consideration
RPP require that a service provider (here, the owners) should be provided with a
reasonable opportunity to recover at least the
efficient costs which it incurs
in providing the relevant services (here, the pipeline) and in complying with
all relevant regulatory
requirements (s 24(2) of the NGL(WA)). According
to the RPP, a service provider should be provided with effective incentives to
promote economic efficiency in the provision of the relevant services by
(amongst other things) the means spelt out in s 24(3) of
the NGL(WA).
Subsections (4) to (7) of s 28 identify a number of other matters to which
“regard should be had”
by the relevant Regulator when making
economic regulatory decisions to which the RPP apply.
performing or exercising its economic regulatory functions or powers under the
WA Act, the NGL(WA) and the Regs, the ERA must perform
or exercise those
functions or powers in a manner that will or is likely to contribute to the
achievement of the NGO (s 28(1)(a)
of the NGL(WA)). This obligation
extends to preferring the decision that the ERA is satisfied will or is likely
to contribute to
the achievement of the NGO over any other decision that might
also contribute to the achievement of the NGO (s 28(1)(b)). In addition,
the ERA must take into account the RPP (s 28(2)(a)).

access arrangement period is to be calculated by
applying a rate of return

which meets the requirements specified in subrules (4) and (5) of r 87 of
the NGR. The
return on equity is to be estimated upon the basis that it
contributes to the achievement of the
allowed rate of return objective
(r 87(6)). In estimating the return on equity under r 87(6), regard
must be had to the prevailing conditions in the market for equity

PIAC and Ausgrid
to which we have referred at
[106]–[107] and [232] above are highly persuasive and should be applied
for the sake of consistency
that sensible administration mandates should

the end, the owners’ challenge to the ERA’s selection of 0.7 for the
equity beta to be applied in the present case
comes down to two matters. These
(a) whether the
ERA committed reviewable error by deciding that the available evidence did not
justify the conclusion that there was
a low beta bias in the outputs from the
SL-CAPM; and
(b) whether, in
any event, the ERA committed reviewable error by declining to adjust the equity
beta produced by the SL-CAPM to accommodate
the actuality that such bias existed
or the potentiality for such bias to exist or, alternatively, by declining to
adjust alpha upwards
to accommodate such low beta bias (actual or
potential).
the fact that the owners maintained the position that the ERA had not taken due
account of the historical data provided to
it by the owners as to actual
relevant rates of returns, this complaint did not, in the end, feature
prominently in the arguments
advanced by the owners before us.
addition, in the end, it seemed to be common ground between the parties that the
only means currently available for making the
adjustment which the owners said
should have been made in the present case were:
(a) arbitrarily
selecting an equity beta at the top of the derived range, a crude and
unprincipled adjustment, at best; or
(b) adjusting
alpha upwards.
Notwithstanding
this, for some time, the owners refrained from submitting that the Tribunal
should direct the ERA to adopt one or
other of these approaches, in the event
that the Tribunal were of the opinion that the matter should be remitted to the
ERA to reconsider
its ROE decision.
it received the owners’ response to its draft decision, the ERA analysed
in detail the owners’ model adequacy tests
and betastar transformation,
which constituted the substance of the owners’ proposal contained in that
Appendix 4 to its final decision, the ERA said that it had significant
concerns with the owners’ approach—both conceptual
and empirical.
It then explained those concerns (at pp 57 to 63 (pars 264 to
the course of that explanation, the ERA repeatedly referred to and relied upon
two expert reports which it had obtained: These
were the report provided by
Pink Lake Analytics entitled
“Statistical Advice to ERA on DBP
Submission 56”,
the Pink Lake Report
) and a report
provided by Partington G and Satchell S entitled
“The Cost of
Equity and Asset Pricing Models”
, May 2016 (
the Partington and
Satchell Report
). The ERA also referred to other academic sources such as,
for example, Professor Davis’ well-known paper
“Cost of Equity
Issues: A Report for the AER”
, January 2011.
p 57 (par 264), the ERA noted the substance of r 87. At
p 57 (par 265), it observed that, when equity prices are in
equilibrium
in the market, the required return is equal to the expected return.
However, the ERA noted that there was no guarantee that expectations
realised or that prices will always be in equilibrium. That could only be the
case if the asset had no risk.
is nothing controversial about the propositions referred to at [269] above.
p 58 (pars 266 and 267), the ERA noted (correctly) that this
conceptual difference between expectations and outcome is a major
problem for
tests of asset pricing models, such as that proposed by the
owners in the present case. The ERA said (correctly) that rational investors
not take on the additional risk of equity expecting it to deliver less than
risky debt, yet this has been an actual outcome in
the market over recent times.
The ERA noted that the approach of the owners did not actually test the return
on equity models against
investors’ expectations for that return,
, as it would need to do in order to determine whether the outputs of
the asset pricing models are biased. Rather, so the ERA said,
the owners are
testing those models against actual outcomes, realised in
p 59 (par 270), the ERA observed that the method which the owners had
adopted in sorting portfolios had reflected its focus on
beta bias which was not
the appropriate way of testing whether the SL-CAPM was the appropriate model to
be used in the present case.
pp 59 to 61 (pars 271 to 278), the ERA examined the owners’
alternative methods for model testing. It ultimately concluded
that there were
significant issues with the construction of the owners’ model adequacy
pp 61 to 63 (pars 279 to 285), the ERA explained its reasons for
thinking that the better way of describing the so called low beta
bias was to
regard it as an
rather than a bias. In these
paragraphs, the ERA drew substantially upon the Pink Lake Report. The authors
of that Report noted
(correctly) that the ERA had derived its ROE calculation
from the Henry statistical version of the SL-CAPM. The Pink Lake Report
to explain the methodology of the ERA. This material is recorded at pp 61
to 62 (par 280) of Appendix 4 to the final decision.
p 62 (par 281), the ERA noted that the authors of the Pink Lake Report
had confirmed that the ERA’s estimate of the SL-CAPM
was not biased.
p 62 (par 283), the ERA concluded that, if there is any
arising in the ERA’s estimate, that bias occurs
because of the ERA’s omission of the alpha intercept term from its
statistical
estimation process.
again referring to the Pink Lake Report (at p 63 (par 284)), the ERA
expressed its conclusion on the questions of the existence
of low beta bias at
p 63 (par 285). The ERA said that it had now come to the view that
there was no justification for changing the
value of beta in the SL-CAPM. In
addition, if that beta were to be adjusted in the manner suggested by the owners
or, indeed, in
any other manner, such an adjustment would introduce a highly
significant bias into the beta estimate in its implementation of the
ERA then moved to consider the question of whether it was appropriate to make an
alpha adjustment. Its consideration of that
matter is found at pp 63 to 66
(pars 286 to 299). Throughout its discussion in this part of
Appendix 4 to the final decision, the
ERA drew heavily on the Pink Lake
Report and the Partington and Satchell Report.
Ultimately,
at p 65 (par 297), the ERA considered that there was inadequate
evidence available to it, at this time, to justify a departure
alpha estimate of zero in its implementation of the SL-CAPM. That is
to say, it rejected the notion that an appropriate adjustment
could and should
be made through an adjustment of the alpha intercept.
ERA then went on to point out that it did not consider the Black CAPM to be the
best asset pricing model to be deployed in the
present case. We note that the
owners do not challenge that conclusion.
ERA then undertook a detailed analysis of the betastar transformation and
rejected that approach. Again, we note that the owners
do not challenge that
pp 93 to 96 (pars 425 to 443), the ERA gathered together the views
which it had expressed at pp 56 to 93 (pars 256 to 424) of
4 to the final decision and ultimately decided that it would
retain the use of the
SL-CAPM for the final
decision, with the beta parameter based on the central best estimate. The ERA
also said that, in light of
the matters which it had discussed, no adjustment
would be made for alpha.
pp 95 to 96 (pars 439 to 443), the ERA said:
The Authority is satisfied that the resulting return on
equity derived using the SL-CAPM is consistent with the allowed rate of return
objective, and with the other requirements of the NGL and NGR. The Authority
considers that the resulting SL-CAPM estimate for the
is reflective of economic and finance principles and market information;
is fit for purpose, which is reflected in its broad acceptance in the finance
industry as a means for estimating the cost of capital;
can be implemented in accordance with good practice;
is parsimonious, is not unduly sensitive to errors in inputs or arbitrary
filtering, and is therefore difficult to game;
uses input data that is credible and verifiable, comparable and timely and
clearly sourced;
is sufficiently flexible to allow for changing market conditions and new
information to be reflected in regulatory outcomes, as
appropriate.
In summary, the Authority determines the following for
the purpose of estimating a return on equity in this Final Decision:
The SL-CAPM will be utilised to estimate the return on equity.
The Fama French (three factor) Model is not relevant and will not be used for
the purpose of estimating a return on equity.
The Black CAPM is relevant for informing the theory of the return on

using this model, the model will not
be used directly.
is it used indirectly. It is only used now to inform the theory of the return on
revised consideration of the theoretical implications of the model makes clear
that no adjustment to equity beta is appropriate.
In addition, the Authority
considers that there is no compelling evidence to apply an alpha adjustment to
the return on equity determined
by the vanilla CAPM, as a means to account for
‘low beta bias’ observed in ex post returns, at the current
The DGM is a relevant model for informing the market return on equity and also
the forward looking MRP.
Other information such as historical data on equity risk premium; surveys of
market risk and other equity analysts’ estimates
are also relevant for the
purpose of estimating the MRP and the market return on equity. In addition,
DBP’s primary cross-check
method is also accepted. This other material
will be used as a cross check for the return on equity.
The Authority remains of the view that its reasons for
adopting the SL-CAPM are sound. The Authority considers that its application
the SL-CAPM meets the requirements of the NGL and NGR, including the allowed
rate of return objective.
Accordingly, the Authority considers that the estimated return on equity adopted
in this Final Decision is commensurate with the
equity costs incurred by a
benchmark efficient entity with a similar degree of risk as DBP with respect to
the provision of reference
services. The Authority therefore considers that the
estimated rate of return meets the allowed rate of return objectives and the
requirements of the NGR and NGL.
In line with the requirements of NGR 87(5), the Authority has evaluated the
relevance of a broad range of material for estimating
the return on equity,
covering relevant estimation methods, financial models, market data and other
evidence for this Final Decision.
ERA recognised that it had changed its approach to the question of assessing
equity beta from the position which it had adopted
in the ROR Guidelines and in
the draft decision. It restated that conclusion at p 99 (par 459) of
Appendix 4 to the final decision.
Pink Lake Report provided to the ERA an updated range for equity beta derived
from the SL-CAPM. The work undertaken by Pink Lake
Analytics in order to
provide that range to the ERA is found in Appendix 4A to the final
decision. Based upon the Pink Lake Analytics
report, the ERA concluded that a
95% confidence interval range of equity beta using the most recent data is from
0.479 to 0.870.
It went on to say that the central best estimate given by the
average of the portfolios is 0.699. Senior Counsel for the ERA pointed
the Tribunal (correctly) that the central best estimate was the mean of the mean
portfolios that fed into the model.
is no doubt that the ERA’s conclusion that there is insufficient evidence
to support the notion that the use of a pure
SL-CAPM will produce outputs which have a low beta bias was based upon the
opinions of the experts which it retained and did not
involve any
misunderstanding on the part of the ERA as to the substance of those opinions.
Further, there is also no doubt that
the ERA’s decision to adopt the
central best estimate from the range of beta so derived and not to make any
arbitrary adjustment
to that central best estimate was also based upon the
opinions of the experts who were providing advice to it. Again, there can
suggestion that the ERA misunderstood the import of those opinions. Similarly,
the ERA’s decision not to make an adjustment
to alpha was also based upon
the advice of its expert advisers.
think that it is well to remember the function which a capital asset pricing
model performs. At a general level, this is explained
succinctly at p 161
(pars 739 to 743) of the
“Explanatory Statement for the Rate of
Return Guidelines”
promulgated by the ERA. In those paragraphs, the
Under the capital asset pricing model (
model, the total risk of an asset is divided into systematic and non-systematic
risk. Systematic risk is a function of broad macroeconomic
factors (such as
economic growth rates) that affect all assets and cannot be eliminated by
diversification of the investor’s
asset portfolio.
The key insight of the CAPM is that the contribution of an asset to the
systematic risk of a portfolio of assets is the correct measure
asset’s risk (known as beta risk) and the only systematic determinant of
the asset’s return, over and above the
return on a risk free asset.
In contrast, non-systematic risk relates to the attributes of a particular
asset. The CAPM assumes this risk can be managed by portfolio
diversification.
Therefore, the investor in an asset does not require compensation for this risk.
Formally, there are three main components of the Sharpe Lintner CAPM for
measuring the return on an asset: (i) the market risk premium
(MRP), which is
the return on the market portfolio in excess of the risk free rate of return,
(ii) the beta risk
, which correlates the return on the specific
asset, in excess of the risk free rate of return, to the rise and fall of the
on the market portfolio and iii) the risk free rate of return. The most
common formulation of the CAPM directly estimates the required
return on the
equity share of an asset as a linear function of the risk free rate and a
component to reflect the risk premium that
investors would require over the risk
is the required rate of return on equity;
is the risk-free rate;
is the equity beta that describes how a particular
will follow the market which is defined as;
) is the market risk premium,
is the market risk premium, MRP. 743.
In the CAPM, the equity beta value is a scaling factor applied to the market
risk premium, to reflect the relative risk for the return
to equity of the firm
in question. Two types of risks are generally considered to determine a value of
equity beta for a particular
firm: (i) the type of business, and associated
capital assets, that the firm operates; and (ii) the amount of financial
(gearing) employed by the firm.
SL-CAPM is a well-known, well-understood, robust, acceptable and tried-and-true
capital asset pricing model. No criticism can
be made of the ERA for deploying
that model in the present circumstances. Indeed, no such criticism is made in
the present case.
the end, the issue before us was very narrow indeed. It was confined to the
question of whether some adjustment to the output
or alternatively to the alpha
intercept should be made in order to reflect some alleged low beta bias.
are of the opinion that, in adopting the approach which it did, the ERA did not
commit reviewable error.
discussion of similar issues at [719] to [788] in
PIAC and Ausgrid

ERA’s decision concerning equity beta.
Indeed, the reasoning in those
paragraphs supports the use of the SL-CAPM.
approach advocated by the owners in its response to the draft decision cannot
truly be classified as a methodology for the assessment
of equity beta.
However, on the assumption that it can be so classified, the present case is
covered by the reasoning of the Full
(at 73 to 74
([171] to [172]) to which we have referred at [117] above. It is not a finding
of fact for the decision maker to make
a choice between permitted methodologies
for the calculation of total revenue nor is it an error of fact for the decision
base its ultimate decision upon a choice of one methodology over
another. As the Full Court said, the relative weight to be given
to the factors
set out in the relevant statutory provision was a matter of discretion (or
regulatory judgment) rather than a finding
of fact which can be impugned as
the exercise by the ERA of regulatory judgment (or discretion) was correct,
having regard to all of the circumstances, nor was
it unreasonable.
Furthermore, even if we are wrong in those conclusions, we are of the opinion
that the owners have fallen well
short of establishing that a reconsideration by
the ERA of its assessment of equity beta would, or would be likely to, result in
a materially preferable designated NGO decision (as to which, see
s 246(1)(a)).
Prima facie

[229]–[256] above to be both correct and persuasive. We accept those
submissions.
form of relief ultimately sought by the owners in relation to Review
Ground 1 is found in MFI-2. In that document, the owners
claimed that the
final decision, insofar as it estimated the owners’ return on equity as a
component of the required rate of
return, should be set aside and remitted to
the ERA upon the basis that the ERA be directed to, in effect, adjust for the
low beta bias:
(a) by relating
actual/historical returns to the SL-CAPM; or
reasonably considers that it is unable to make such an adjustment in a
sufficiently transparent way, by selecting that beta
which is at the top of the
range in the final range of betas supplied to the ERA by Pink Lake Analytics
(0.87), as to which, see
the extracts from Appendix 4 set out at [192]
If it were necessary to decide, we would not be prepared to grant relief in that
form because:
(a) the primary claim for relief would, if granted, present a near impossible
task for the ERA; and
(b) the second claim for relief, namely, the selection of 0.87 as the
appropriate equity beta, would produce an arbitrary result.
all of the above reasons, we reject Review Ground 1.
GROUND 2 – THE OWNERS’ CHALLENGE TO THE GAMMA
owners complain about the ERA’s final decision to deploy a gamma of 0.4 as
the value of imputation credits to be inputted
into the building block model.
The critical questions raised by this ground of review involve the true
interpretation of r 87A and
its correct application in the circumstances of
the present case insofar as the assessment of the value of imputation credits
is concerned. As the ERA said in Appendix 5, the gamma parameter
accounts for the reduction in the effective corporate taxation
that is generated
by the distribution of franking credits to investors. As a general rule,
investors who are able to utilise franking
credits will accept the lower
required rate of return, before personal tax, on an investment that has franking
credits, compared
with an investment that has similar risk and no franking
credits, all other things being equal. As the owners also submitted, if
benefit to investors from imputation credits is not taken into account, the
amount of revenue required to provide an appropriate
be overstated. Since allowable revenue has to include (
amount to cover the costs of corporate income tax and an amount for the return
on equity, mathematically the benefit that investors
obtain from imputation
credits could be deducted from either with the same effect. The NGR adopts the
approach of deducting the
benefit from the cost of corporate income tax.
its final decision, the ERA derived a gamma of 0.4.
the present case, the owners complain that the ERA’s derived gamma
overstated the value of the imputation credits to be deducted.
contended that this was brought about by the application to the relevant formula
of an incorrect utilisation rate (theta).
The owners’ proposition (based
upon the Tribunal’s decision in
PIAC and Ausgrid
), was that the ERA
has utilised methods that measure the wrong thing. It was submitted that the
ERA’s approach is inconsistent
with the proper construction of r 87A,
inconsistent with the proper conceptual approach to the treatment of imputation
the scheme of economic regulation, inconsistent with the ERA’s
approach to return on equity and inconsistent with the satisfaction
owners observed that the common approach to the assessment of gamma is that
gamma, in the formula in r 87A of the NGR, is to be
calculated as the
product of:
distribution rate for imputation credits, usually expressed as a decimal ratio;
(b) The value
of distributed imputation credits (theta), again expressed as a decimal
That is, gamma equals distribution rate times theta.
ERA’s decision in respect of gamma is effectively the same decision as it
made in the
case and the same as the decision that the AER made
that was subject to review by the Tribunal in

the Tribunal in
PIAC and Ausgrid
employed different reasoning and
supports a position adopted by the owners in the present case. The ERA adopted
the same gamma (0.4)
as it had adopted in

0.25 which they said was supported by
PIAC and Ausgrid
owners also relied upon the concession made by the ERA in the
case to the effect that it had made a reviewable error by applying a gamma of
0.4 and that the best estimate of gamma on the basis
of the material before the
ERA at the time of its decision in the
case was 0.25.
pars 266 to 269 of their Written Submissions, the owners said:
As a matter of discretion, this Tribunal should not
embark upon another reconsideration of the same decision that has recently been
found by a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal to involve error, but
rather should simply adopt the earlier Tribunal decision.
Aside from the cost to
the parties of re-hearing the same issues for what will be a fourth time, any
reconsideration would also give
rise to the risk of inconsistent Tribunal
judgments on the very same decision. Amongst other difficulties with such a
would undermine confidence and certainty in the regulatory regime,
and would therefore not promote the objects of the statutory schemes
under which
the Tribunal carries out its review functions (i.e. the NGO). Those
considerations apply
in respect to the ERA’s
inconsistent approaches between ATCO Gas and the Applicant, including its
concession in
that it would be against the public interest, in
promoting consistency of decision making, to reargue the matters determined in
PIAC and Ausgrid
A further reason not to reconsider the issue is because of the AER’s
judicial review application (including the gamma ground)
which is being heard by
the Full Court of the Federal Court in October 2016 [Australian Energy Regulator
v Australian Competition
Tribunal & Anor, NSD 415 - 420 of 2016. As at the
date of these submissions, the hearing is part heard and commenced on 18 October
2016]. If there is any error in the previous Tribunal decision, then this will
be considered by the Full Court. This provides two
further reasons for the
present Tribunal not to embark upon a reconsideration.

is being considered elsewhere.
, if the present Tribunal was to
embark upon a reconsideration of the gamma issue, then there would be separate
consideration by each
of the current Tribunal, and the Full Court, of the
question of whether the previous Tribunal decision was affected by any relevant
error. This would present the obvious risk of inconsistent judgments from the
current Tribunal and the Full Court.
Therefore, the Tribunal’s consideration in the present case should, as a
matter of discretion, be limited to a consideration
of whether there is anything
in the present ERA decision that distinguishes it from the earlier

we have mentioned at [122] above, the Full Court in
AER v ACT (No 2)
considered the question of gamma in considerable detail. The Full Court adopted
the same approach in
. The decision of the Full Court in that matter
is important for present purposes. We shall discuss that decision after the
section of these Reasons in which we set out the terms of the final
decision relevant to gamma.
The Final Decision (Gamma)
p 223 (pars 1071 to 1075), the ERA set out its ultimate conclusions in
relation to the value of gamma. In those paragraphs, it
The Authority is required by the NGR to estimate the
value of gamma, a parameter in the building block revenue model.
The gamma parameter accounts for the reduction in the effective corporate
taxation that is generated by the distribution of franking
credits to investors.
As a general rule, investors who are able to utilise franking credits will
accept a lower required rate of
return, before personal tax, on an investment
that has franking credits, compared with an investment that has similar risk and
franking credits, all other things being equal.
DBP’s original proposal included a gamma of 0.25. In its Draft Decision
the Authority did not accept this value and instead
determined a gamma of 0.4.
The Authority required the following amendment:
Required Amendment 15
DBP is required to adopt a gamma of 0.4.
In its response to the Draft Decision, DBP did not
accept Required Amendment 14.
The Authority’s consideration of DBP’s amended proposal is set out
in Appendix 5. The Authority has determined a gamma
of 0.4. Reasoning for the
Authority’s decision is set out in Appendix 5 of this Final
reasoning of the ERA in respect of gamma is found in Appendix 5 to the
final decision.
Appendix 5 to the final decision, the ERA gave a brief account of the
history of its assessment of gamma.
p 7 (par 41) of Appendix 5, the ERA recorded that, for the
purposes of its draft decision, it had re-examined its method for estimating
gamma and had adopted a different estimate to that which it had set out in the
ROR Guidelines.
pp 7 to 8 (pars 42 to 44), the ERA said that it had further considered
its position in light of the owners’ response to its
draft decision and
that, in evaluating its position, it had taken into account a large number of
factors and reports listed in those
paragraphs. At p 8 (par 43), the
ERA noted that the experts to whom it had had regard differed in their
interpretation of the best
approach to estimating gamma in the regulatory
setting. This was particularly the case with regard to the value of the
utilisation
rate (theta). The ERA stated that it did not consider that the
Tribunal had come to a firm position in relation to the correct approach
gamma in the regulatory context and that it was not, therefore, bound to follow
the Tribunal’s decision in relation to gamma
PIAC and Ausgrid
pp 1 to 2 (pars 3 to 10) of Appendix 5, the ERA explained its
understanding of the relevant regulatory requirements in the following
(omitting footnotes):
Rule 87A of the NGR requires that the estimated cost of
corporate income tax of a service provider for each regulatory year of an
arrangement period (ETCt) is to be estimated in accordance with formula (1).
Rule 87A accounts for the ability of imputation credits to reduce the effective
corporate tax rate for equity investors.
In determining the value of imputation credits, the Authority is required to
account for the national gas objective, the National
(including the revenue and pricing principles) and the NGR.
In the Rate of Return Guidelines, the Authority estimated gamma (
the product of the distribution rate
and the estimate of the
utilisation rate
theta), consistent with the approach set out
in the Rate of Return Guidelines (equation 2)
Under this Officer formulation (as extended by Monkhouse), gamma depends on the
degree to which imputation credits are distributed
and the degree to which
investors utilise those credits that are distributed.
Contributing to the estimate of gamma, the Rate of Return Guidelines adopted an
estimate for the distribution rate,
, of 0.7. The 0.7 rate was based on
Australian Taxation Office (
) data showing around 70 per cent of
cumulative imputation credits created had been distributed.
For the utilisation rate, the Rate of Return Guidelines adopted a range of 0.35
to 0.55. This estimated range was based on the results
of Dividend Drop Off
The resulting range for gamma adopted for the Rate of Return Guidelines –
given by the product of distribution rate and the
range for the utilisation rate
– was 0.25 to 0.385.
p 10 (par 51), the ERA said that it took the view that the benefit
arising from imputation credits can be interpreted as the proportion
of franking
credits distributed, multiplied by the proportion of those that are utilised by
the representative investor. The ERA
then referred to an expert report from the
owners’ consultant (Gray) and noted that the key challenge to the
ERA’s revised
view of gamma therefore related to the estimate of the
utilisation rate (theta).
at pp 11 to 15 (pars 55 to 69) of Appendix 5, the ERA explained
the essence of its view in relation to the utilisation rate
(theta). In those
paragraphs, the ERA said (omitting footnotes):
The Authority considers that the benefit of distributed
imputation credits will rely on the proportion of franking credits received
are utilised by the representative investor. The estimate of this proportion is
the utilisation rate, theta (
The Authority notes that the utilisation rate is a market-level parameter,
meaning that the same value applies to all firms.
Individual investors have differing utilisation rates; investors who are able to
fully use tax credits are assigned a value of one
whilst investors who cannot
are assigned a value of zero. These individual utilisation rates may be weighted
to produce the required
market-level utilisation rate
Authority therefore considers that θ ‘is a complex weighted average
over all investors holding risky assets, where
the weights incorporate each
investor’s investment in risky assets, and their level of risk
To this end, the Authority’s previous (Rate of Return Guidelines)
estimation approach for estimating theta – using DDO
studies – may
not correctly estimate the utilisation rate required, as, among other
The utilisation rate is a complex weighted average over investors, reflecting
their relative wealth and risk aversion, and this
need not correspond to the
market value of the credits whether estimated by a DDO study or any other market
based method. Even Gray
accepts that, if theta is not defined as the market
value of the credits, then market value studies such as DDO analysis will be
limited relevance.
DDO studies at best only estimate the utilisation rate around just two days,
the cum-dividend and ex-dividend dates. As a consequence,
they provide an
estimate of the utilisation rate with weights that reflect the composition of
investors around the cum and ex dividend
dates, not the weighted average across
all points in time, as required. Furthermore, such investors may be quite
untypical of investors
in general. The ‘market’ value in these
studies are influenced by the
investor over those dates, rather
than the value attributed across all investors.
DDO studies may not accurately separate out the effect of the taxation benefits
associated with imputation credits on the share
price change from the effect of
the cash dividend. There are a range of statistical models that could be used,
choices over which
data to use, and the results seem to be quite sensitive to a
small number of outlying observations.
There is considerable evidence of anomalous share price behaviour around ex
days, which raises the possibility that any estimate
of the utilisation rate
from a DDO is instead reflecting that anomalous behaviour.
Estimates of the market value of the credits from methods other than DDOs
produce markedly different results, which undermines the
credibility of such
market-based estimates.
For these reasons, the Authority has determined to place
limited weight on the DDO estimates, and on the range of applied market value
estimates more generally.
The Authority instead considers other approaches to estimating the utilisation
In response, DBP’s consultant Gray has argued that the Authority is in
error in interpreting theta (and hence gamma) as the
utilisation rate, rather
than in terms of the value to the representative investor.
First, Gray points to the revised language of NGR 87A, which states that
‘gamma is the value of imputation credits’,
rather than the previous
term ‘utilisation of imputation credits’. Gray acknowledges that the
Australian Energy Market
Commission did not provide a detailed explanation about
the changed language in its Final Determination, but considers that its apparent
intention was to be clear that imputation credits did not rely on utilisation.
The Authority notes that the AER sought clarification
from the AEMC on the
reason for the change, which was unable to provide ‘any further
insight’.66 In any event, the definition
of a parameter within a model can
only be determined from a rigorous derivation of the model.
Second, Gray has argued that the parameter U in the following equation from
Lally’s analysis, specifically within the term
IC1U, is defined as the
value that investors attribute to imputation credits:
However, the Authority notes that Lally clearly states in context that U in the
equation is a market level parameter, derived as
a complex weighted average over
all investors holding risky assets:
So, relative to the standard form of the
CAPM, the Officer CAPM and the associated cash flows requires three additional
parameters:
the ratio of market-level imputation credits to the value of the
market portfolio (ICm/Sm), the ratio of firm-level imputation credits
level company tax payments (IC/TAX) and the utilisation rate (U). The second of
these parameters is called the “distribution
rate” and the product
of the last two is called “gamma”.
The utilisation rate referred to here is a market-level parameter, i.e., the
same value applies to each firm. Individual investors
also have utilisation
rates: one for those who can fully use the credits and zero for those who
can’t. Consequently it might
be presumed that U is some type of weighted
average over investors. Although Officer (1994) provides no clarification on
this matter,
because his derivation of the model is intuitive rather than
formal, Lally and van Zijl (2003, section 3) provide a formal derivation
generalisation of Officer’s model (with the Officer model being a special
case), in which variation of utilisation rates
across investors is recognised.
In this derivation, they show that U is a complex weighted average over all
investors holding risky
assets, where the weights involve each investor’s
investment in risky assets and their risk aversion. Individual investors’
levels of risk aversion are not observable. Accordingly it is necessary to
(reasonably) act as if risk aversion is uncorrelated with
utilisation rate at
the investor level, in which case the weights reduce to investors’
relative investments in risky assets,
i.e., U is a value-weighted average over
the utilisation rates of individual
Third, Gray considers that there is a material
difference between the utilisation rate (the proportion of credits that are
at the tax office) and the value of those credits to shareholders.
Gray’s core argument is that there is a cost for an investor
to obtain and
redeem a credit. Gray considers that:
some credits
that are distributed are never redeemed, for example because;
– the investors are non-residents; and
– the 45 day rule precludes it;
record keeping
creates administrative costs;
there is a time
delay in obtaining the benefit;
credits are taxed at their face value;
as resident
investors adjust their portfolio to hold domestic shares for imputation, their
portfolios will become less diversified,
at a cost; and
investor would increase the concentration of domestic shares in their portfolio
until the marginal benefit of imputation
The Authority has noted these points, but has come to
the view that:
the first of
these points is uncontroversial; it reduces both the utilisation rate as
properly defined and the market value of the
the remaining
points do or may give rise to a divergence between the utilisation rate as
properly defined and the market value of
the credits, but any such divergences
make the market value of the credits less suitable as an estimator of the
utilisation rate;
arguments against using market prices to estimate the utilisation rate rather
than arguments in support of using market
the effects of
the time value of money are likely to be minimal, given the period of delay;
there is no
empirical evidence on the diversification effect of imputation credits, and no
clear theoretical position for the effect
In addition, transaction and other costs are unlikely to
materially affect redemption of imputation credits, as investors are required
report franked dividends and eligible imputation credits, such that the
incremental cost of these other costs to shareholding
is likely to be small.
The Authority’s view then is that these considerations do not detract from
the fact that some investors will redeem credits,
and thus have a utilisation
rate of 1, and other investors in the Australian share market will not redeem
credits, and will thus
have a utilisation rate of 0. In the Authority’s
view, there is no case here that the utilisation rate is not a complex weighted
average across all investors, both domestic and international. That complex
weighted average depends on risk aversion and wealth.
Therefore the Authority is of the view that approaches that directly inform the
degree of utilisation of imputation credits will
provide relevant information.
Those approaches include the domestic ownership share of equity, and taxation
statistics on the proportion
of redeemed imputation
the paragraphs which I have extracted from Appendix 5, the ERA supported
its observations by references to two reports.
Those reports were:
The Estimation of Gamma
, Report for the AER, November 2013;
and Lally M and van Zijl T,
Capital Gains Tax and the Capital Asset
Pricing Model
, Accounting and Finance, Vol 43, 2003. The ERA also
referred to the experts relied upon by the owners, being the report of Gray
Consulting) and a report from Frontier Economics.
ERA continued to discuss the various experts’ reports at pp 15 to 21
(pars 68 to 92) of Appendix 5.
p 21 (pars 90 to 92), the ERA said:
The Authority notes that both Handley and Lally consider
that it is appropriate to assume a domestic capital market for the purpose
estimating theta. Further, both take the position – in opposition to Gray
– that the complex weighted average approach
is preferable to market based
approaches. The main point of difference between Handley and Lally is whether or
not international
investors should be excluded from the model.
Based on the foregoing, the Authority considers, on the balance of the
arguments, that use of the CAPM and interpretation of theta
as the utilisation
rate (as a complex weighted average) is consistent with the assumption that the
CAPM applies to a domestic market
that includes the presence of international
In light of the foregoing, the Authority considers that there is considerable
uncertainty surrounding the estimation of the utilisation
rate. The Authority
therefore considers that applying a range of approaches is desirable in
determining the estimate.
ERA utilised data from all equity (both listed and unlisted).
pp 25 to 26 (pars 107 to 112), the ERA set out its conclusions in
relation to the utilisation rate and the reasons for those conclusions.
those paragraphs (omitting footnotes) the ERA said:
The Authority estimates the utilisation rate of
imputation credits as being in the range of 0.47 to 0.59 at the current time
on the most recent ABS data for December 2015, and using the
‘refined’ approach), depending on whether the estimate is
listed or all equity respectively.
The Authority notes that this is somewhat lower than Handley’s estimate,
which is that the corresponding range is 0.5 to 0.7,
depending on whether listed
or all equity is used. The Authority notes that Handley’s estimate is
based on earlier ABS data
(March 2014), and also took account of the estimate of
Hathaway, that ‘domestic investors held between 75 per cent and 81 per
cent of Australian equity between 1988 and 2012’. The Authority has not
accounted for Hathaway’s data, given its preference
to focus on the
estimates for the post-2000 period.
In respect of the choice between listed and all equity, the fact that only
listed equity is used to estimate the MRP and beta suggests
that the same
limitation be applied to the present issue. However, Lally argues that the
limitation is only imposed for the MRP and
beta because data from unlisted firms
is entirely inadequate for estimating returns.
The Authority notes this argument for the use of listed equity, but is also
aware that there is a lack of consensus in relation to
this point. In the recent
AusNet Services decision, the AER responded by considering both listed equity,
and all equity (both listed
and unlisted). The Authority has adopted a similar
approach in this decision.
In its recent PIAC-AusGrid Decision, the ACT argues that the estimate of theta
from the equity ownership approach is an upper bound,
due to time delays,
administrative costs in distributing the credits, portfolio effects, and the
effect of the 45 day rule. Given
the ACT’s belief that theta is the market
value of the credits, this would seem to follow. However, the Authority
that the ACT’s belief about theta is in error; theta is not the
market value of the credits but is instead a complex weighted
average over
investors’ utilisation rates.
In addition, even if theta were the market value of the credits, the belief that
the equity ownership proportion necessarily exceeds
the market value of the
credits due to administrative costs, time delays, portfolio effects,
is erroneous. For example, if 50 per cent of Australian equities were
foreign owned on average, tax arbitrage involving local investors
buying shares
shortly before dividend ex-days and selling them shortly afterwards could lead
to all credits being redeemed by locals
and therefore the market value on the
credits could be close to 1.0. Consequently, the market value of the credits may
be above the
proportion of equity owned by Australian
ERA then turned to the question of the appropriate use of taxation statistics.
In that context, it discussed various expert opinions.
At pp 27 to 28
(pars 123 to 125), the ERA set out its conclusions in relation to utilising
taxation statistics to derive an estimate
of gamma in the following terms
(omitting footnotes):
The Authority notes that the AER recently set out the
evidence for the estimate based on tax statistics in a further review, drawing
on, and further, considering views from the experts:
the evidence
assembled by Hathaway, NERA, Gray, and the AER points to a range of around 0.4
to 0.6 for the utilisation rate;
based on the
observation that the post-2004 taxation statistics data is more reliable than
data available prior to that date:
In this current work I only
consider franking credit flows for the period for 2004 onwards and can provide a
much more detailed insight
into the flows and utilisations of franking credits
for that period
I would caution anyone, including the AER, against relying on those parts of my
earlier reports which focussed on ATO statistics
[up to 2004]. The data was then
not as clear as it is today. I had to rely on separate analyses of ATO tax data
and the ATO financial
data. As I am now aware with the new data, there is an
extremely large discrepancy between these two subsets of data. The missing
was the data on the flows of credits between companies which is now visible
after the changes of 1 July 2002. I would recommend
that the AER do not rely on
that earlier report.
informed by two
estimates of the distribution rate for the period 2004 to 2011, being 0.43 and
more recently
updating the 0.44 estimate to 0.48 using ATO FAB data to the 2014 tax year,
(updated) 0.48 estimate of the utilisation rate (using ATO FAB data) corresponds
to estimates of the distribution rate
of around 0.7;
0.61 estimate of the utilisation rate (using ATO dividend data) corresponds to
estimates of the distribution rate of around
with the updated
0.48 estimate based on post-2004 data being preferred as reasonable as it is
consistent with an estimate of the distribution
rate for ‘all
equity’ of 0.7.
The Authority has reviewed this evidence and considers
that the Hathaway study provides the best estimate of the utilisation rate
derived from taxation statistics. The Authority has also been guided by
Hathaway’s finding that the ATO FAB data is more reliable
than the ATO
dividend data. On that basis, the Authority considers that a point estimate of
0.48 (as updated by the AER) should be
applied, paired with a distribution rate
based on all equity of 0.7.
However, the Authority remains mindful of Hathaway’s concerns with the ATO
data, and the pointed caution about relying on it
for estimating utilisation
Unfortunately, there are too many
unreconciled problems with the ATO data for reliable estimates to be made about
the utilisation
of franking credits. The utilisation rate of franking credits is
based on dividend data (from the tax office) and I have demonstrated
data is questionable.
pp 44 to 49 (pars 196 to 225) of Appendix 5, the ERA set out its
conclusions in relation to gamma in the following terms:
Having considered Gray’s arguments, the estimates made by Handley, Lally,
and other experts, the AER’s recent determination,
and the reliability of
the data underpinning these various estimates, the Authority considers that a
reasonable estimate of the distribution
rate for listed equity is a rounded
estimate of 0.8.
Estimate of gamma
The Authority considers that three different approaches to estimating gamma are
appropriate, based on the following methods for estimating
the utilisation
• the equity share approach;
• the taxation statistics approach; and
• the DDO method.
The Authority considers that, consistent with this conclusion, the ‘most
important approaches to estimation in order of importance
to be the equity
ownership approach, the taxation statistics approach, and DDO studies (being the
most relevant within the class
of implied market value studies)’ [J.C.
Advice on the Value of Imputation Credits,
29 September 2014, p.
31]. However, the Authority agrees that ‘all approaches are subject to
substantial uncertainty and so
the estimate of theta is imprecise’[J.C.
Advice on the Value of Imputation Credits,
29 September
2014, p. 32].
In considering the weight to be given to each approach, the Authority notes the
AER’s conclusion that [Australian Energy Regulator,
AusNet Services
distribution determination final decision 2016-20: Attachment 4 – Value of
imputation credits
, 26 May 2016, p. 4-17]:
...estimating the value of imputation
credits consistent with the Officer framework will best promote the National
Electricity Objective/National
Gas Objective (NEO/NGO) and other requirements of
the [National Electricity Rules/National Gas
In identifying a methodology consistent with the Officer
framework, the AER noted that the equity share ownership, and tax statistics
approaches are reasonably consistent with the Officer framework. However, DDO
studies are affected by factors such as personal taxation
and other costs. As
such, they are inconsistent with the Officer framework unless adjusted
[Australian Energy Regulator,
AusNet Services distribution determination
final decision 2016-20: Attachment 4 – Value of imputation credits,
May 2016, p. 4-11].
The Authority agrees with Handley that the equity ownership and tax statistics
on utilisation of imputation credits provide key evidence
for the utilisation
rate. The Authority has also considered DDO estimates.
In what follows, these estimates are considered.
The equity share ownership estimate
The Authority’s estimate of the utilisation rate based on the equity share
ownership approach is either 0.59 (all equity –
both listed and unlisted)
or 0.47 (listed equity).
Combining the utilisation rate estimate for all equity, of 0.59, with the
estimate of the distribution rate of all equity, of 0.7,
gives an estimate of
gamma of 0.41.
Combining the utilisation rate estimate for listed equity, of 0.47, with the
estimate of the distribution rate for listed equity,
of 0.8, gives an estimate
of gamma of 0.38.
The taxation statistics estimate of the redemption rate
The Authority’s estimate of the utilisation rate based on taxation
statistics approach (using ATO FAB data) is 0.48. Combining
that estimate with
the relevant estimate of the distribution rate of 0.7 (all equity) gives a point
estimate of gamma of 0.3, at
one significant figure.
The dividend drop off estimate
As discussed above, the Authority’s estimate of the utilisation rate from
DDO studies is fairly broad, at 0.35 to 0.69, reflecting
concerns with the
robustness of the method.
That range for the utilisation rate combines with an estimate of the
distribution rate for listed equity of 0.8 [The Authority considers
that it was
in error in the Guidelines and Draft Decision in applying an estimate of the
distribution rate that was based on all
equity]. The resulting range for gamma
is 0.28 to 0.55, rounded to one significant figure.
Estimate of gamma
The Authority bases its estimate of gamma on the following, with estimates given
most weight ranked first:
the equity share ownership approach gives an estimate of gamma of 0.41 based on
all equity, and 0.38 based on listed equity with
a distribution rate of 0.8;
the taxation statistics approach, using ATO FAB data, gives an estimate of
gamma of 0.34; and
the DDO approach gives a range for the estimate of gamma of 0.28 to 0.55
assuming a distribution rate of 0.8.
The resulting range for the Authority’s estimate
of gamma is 0.28 to 0.55, as shown in Table 2.
Consistent with its approach set out in the Draft Decision, the Authority places
most reliance on the equity share ownership approach.
It suggests a point
estimate for gamma of 0.4.
Taxation statistics, using the ATO FAB data, suggest that the estimate of gamma
could be lower, at 0.34. However, the Authority does
not place much weight on
the estimate, or on its ability to inform a point estimate of the utilisation
rate, given concerns about
the robustness of the taxation data used for
estimating the utilisation rate.
Similarly, the DDO estimate suggests that the estimate of gamma could be higher
or lower than 0.4, although the mid-point of the
estimate range is reasonably
consistent with an estimate of 0.4. The Authority gives only limited weight to
the estimated range,
and to the point estimate, given its concerns with regard
to the sensitivity of the estimates to the dividend sample, parametric
the regression equation and regression technique used.
The Authority notes that DBP has suggested that the foregoing estimates do not
develop an appropriate range [DBP,
Proposed Revisions DBNGP Access
Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Regulatory Period Response to ERA Issues Paper
Submission 26
, 2 June 2015, p. 13]:
DBP does not believe that the ERA ought to
continue to deviate from its own Guidelines by using the AER’s approach to
gamma. However, if it does deviate from the Guidelines in respect of
gamma, it should at least do so properly, and with relevant
information. Instead
of ranges based on somewhat irrelevant and misleading historical data, what one
actually has using the AER’s
preferred approach is three estimates of
(a) One based on the share of ownership of all equity would give a gamma of 0.42
(0.6 for theta and 0.7 for the distribution rate).
(b) One based on the share of ownership of listed equity would give a gamma of
0.315 (0.45 for theta and 0.7 for the distribution
rate; based on NERA’s
(c) One based on taxation statistics would give a gamma of 0.3 (0.43 for theta,
according to the AER, and 0.7 for the distribution
The relevant range formed by these three estimates is not 0.3 to 0.5, but 0.3 to
0.42; the larger range is only created by using
ranges for theta which give
equal weight to single instances of outliers far from the mean and multiple
instances of data-points
close to the mean, effectively giving each outlier a
much greater weight compared to each point close to the mean [[DBP footnote]
note that giving weight to outliers at the expense of values close to the mean
(which we submit is wrong in any event) would run
counter to the ERA’s own
approach of using so-called Robust regression in estimates of beta to limit the
influence of outliers.
It would be curious if the ERA adopted an approach which
minimised the influence of outliers in respect of beta, and maximised the
influence of outliers in respect of gamma]. Moreover, two of these estimates,
including one which the AER’s own advisor and
the ERA have previously
suggested forms an upper bound for gamma, [[DBP footnote] We note that the
AER’s adviser, Handley,
has more recently reversed himself on this point,
but his reasoning is not particularly convincing; see SFG (2015, p22-3) for a
detailed treatment.] are towards the lower end of the range and are in fact
almost the same. This would suggest that a prudent, objective
regulator, having
regard to the information which the AER suggests it believes is most relevant,
would form an estimate of gamma
in the lower half of the range between 0.3 and
0.42, not at the upper end of that range as the AER has
However, in relation to the following points raised by
First, as noted above, the Authority does not accept DBP’s view on the
distribution rate for listed equity. That leaves the
Authority’s estimate
based on the equity share ownership approach at 0.4.
Second, DBP does not dispute that the estimate based on taxation statistics is
proximate to 0.34.
Third, the use of DDO estimates – which is preferred by DBP but which is
omitted from the above list – is 0.28 to 0.55.
On that basis, the overall range is 0.28 to 0.55. Furthermore, the Authority
considers that it is prudent and objective –
in giving weight to those
estimates – to adopt an estimate of 0.4.
DBP also quotes Officer to support its view that only
implied market value studies are capable of estimating theta [DBP, Proposed
Revisions DBNGP Access Arrangement 2016 – 2020 Regulatory Period Response
to ERA Issues Paper Submission 26, 2 June 2015, p.
13.]. The Authority does not
dispute that implied market value studies, however imperfect, provide relevant
information as to the
value of theta. Accordingly, the Authority has taken DDO
studies into account. However, as articulated above, the Authority does
consider that to be the only method available.
In summary, based on the foregoing, the Authority considers that the evidence
supports a prudent point estimate of gamma of 0.4.
Therefore, the Authority does
not accept the value of 0.25 put forward by DBP.
The Authority considers that the resulting estimate of 0.4 is consistent with
its approach used elsewhere in this Final Decision,
and in particular the use of
the value of imputation credits within the building block framework. The
estimate is supported by a
range of evidence, including relevant academic
literature, and also the views of academic experts:
the estimate is within the range set out by Handley for his preferred estimate
of gamma, of 0.4 to 0.5 [J. Handley, Advice on the
value of imputation credits,
29 September 2014, p. 3.]; and
the estimate is primarily based on the equity share ownership approach, which
is Lally’s second preference as a method for
estimating gamma (after a
strict Officer CAPM approach, which gives a value of 0.7 based on a utilisation
rate of 1) [M. Lally, The
Estimation of Gamma, Report for the AER, 23 November
2013, p. 5.].
Consistency with the National Gas Law and National
Consistent with the expert advice considered for this Final Decision, the
Authority has determined that the Officer framework rightly
provides the basis
for the rate of return framework in the NGL and the NGR. It follows that
estimating the value of imputation credits
consistent with the Officer framework
will best promote the NGO and the other requirements of the NGR.
To this end, the Authority has considered the differing expert opinions on the
proper interpretation of the gamma parameter in the
Officer framework. The
Authority considered Handley's expert advice for the AER on the Officer
framework at length in the Draft Decision.
An important aspect of that advice is
that the framework is on a ‘before-personal-tax and before-personal-costs'
By determining a value of imputation credits in a manner consistent with the
Officer framework, the Authority considers that this
Final Decision is made in a
manner that will or is likely to contribute to the achievement of the NGO.
Further, when exercising its
discretion in making the relevant parts of a
decision, the Authority has accounted for the revenue and pricing principles
). The RPP provide, amongst other things,
a service provider should be provided with a reasonable opportunity to recover
at least the efficient costs the operator incurs
providing regulated services
and complying with regulatory obligations;
a service provider should be provided with effective incentives in order to
promote economic efficiency with respect to the regulated
services it provides;
a price, charge or tariff for the provision of a regulated service should allow
for a return commensurate with the regulatory and
commercial risks involved in
providing the regulated service.
Therefore, the gamma determined for this Final Decision
will promote the achievement of the NGO (via its application in the estimated
cost of corporate income tax building block) if it takes into account the RPP,
not too low, in that it contributes to providing a reasonable opportunity to
recover at least efficient corporate tax costs; and
not too high, in that it contributes to a return that is not excessive and is
commensurate with the relevant risks.
Finding the right balance in this task has been served
by having regard to the merits of the full range of relevant evidence. The
Authority has considered, and relied upon, the range of relevant evidence set
out in this Appendix. The Authority is satisfied that
the gamma balances first,
the opportunity for service providers to recover at least efficient costs, and
second, the relevant risks.
The Authority therefore considers that its estimate is fit for purpose,
notwithstanding concerns with the data and the resulting
robustness of the
estimates. Importantly, the use of a range of approaches for estimating gamma
assists in overcoming limitations
associated with any particular study. This

principles, informed by sound empirical analysis. For these
reasons, the Authority considers that its estimates meet the requirements

In contrast, the Authority notes that DBP’s proposed estimate is based on
a single study, of questionable robustness. The Authority
considers that
DBP’s proposed estimate does not provide the best estimate for the
purposes of the NGL and the NGR, and therefore
has determined to amend
DBP’s value of gamma for use in the building block

The Full Court’s Decision in AER v ACT
Full Court considered the issues relating to gamma at 145–173 [618] to
17 of the AER’s challenge to the Tribunal’s decision in relation to
gamma was that the Tribunal erred in its construction
of the expression
“the value of imputation credits”
in the NER, which error was
based upon its rejection of the estimation methodologies preferred by the AER.
The relevant rule in
the NER was the same as r 87A.
the course of considering the various grounds relating to grounds of review
relating to gamma, at 167 [742], the Full Court said:
The substantial point of difference between the Tribunal
and the AER was as to the meaning of “value” in that statutory
context: the
. It was not merely as to the weighing of evidence, or
preference on the part of the Tribunal for one type of evidence over another.
The measures which were used flowed from the interpretation of the statutory
expression “the value of imputation credits”.
For example, the
respondents contended, and the Tribunal accepted, that the equity ownership and
tax statistics measures were not
appropriate because those measures were not
measuring the correct thing but a subset of it, and therefore were not in
with the correct interpretation of the
. It would follow
that there was error, reviewable by the Tribunal, in the AER giving primary
weight to such measures. Put differently,
the appropriate method, sources of
information and/or weight to be attributed to each data source when determining
of imputation credits” was a derivative of the
interpretation of that term.
168 [746], the Full Court said:
Ground 17 was to the effect that the Tribunal
misconstrued and misunderstood the meaning of the expression “value of
credits” in r 6.5.3 of the
and the requirements of
, including the revenue and pricing principles set out in
s 7A of the
168 [748], the Full Court said that the correct interpretation of the expression
“value of imputation credits”
was the key dispute for the
Court to resolve. The Tribunal had taken the view that it was necessary to
consider both the eligibility
of investors to redeem imputation credits and the
extent to which investors determined the worth of imputation credits to them.
168 to 169 [750] to [757], the Full Court said:
The Tribunal expressed its conclusion on the question of
construction at [1081], stating, in effect, that in light of its discussion
the competing views and the implications of those views, it did not accept the
AER’s approach that imputation credits were
valued at their claimable
amount or face value. The Tribunal said the value was not what can be claimed or
utilised, but what is
claimed or utilised as demonstrated by the behaviour of
the shareholder recipients of the imputation credits.
In our opinion, the Tribunal erred in law in construing r 6.5.3 of the
and r 87A of the
as invalidating the AER’s
approach to estimating the estimated cost of corporate income tax of the
respondents where gamma
is the value of imputation credits. In our opinion, the
expression “the value of imputation credits” is to be construed
whole, in its context and having regard to the subject matter of the exercise.
It would be an error to limit attention to the
word “value” and give
it a meaning in isolation. In essence, we think this is what the Tribunal did.
The Tribunal thereby
misunderstood the function of imputation credits under the
Rules in relation to the return on capital and the tax building block.
We accept the AER’s submission that the context is the determination of a
regulated return using a post-tax revenue model based
on a nominal vanilla WACC.
We accept the AER’s submission that the Rules require consistency in the
way the relevant building
blocks interact, that is, a post-company tax and
pre-personal tax and personal costs basis. We also note that the nature of gamma
is an estimate to be used in a model.
The present context relates to a statutory model rather than the value of
something which exists. In our opinion the Tribunal was
distracted by the
apparent simplicity of the concept of market studies and data into mistaking
what was to be estimated as real in
a market rather than as estimates within a
This is what led the Tribunal into error at [1081]-[1082] in concluding that the
value of gamma is (only) what is claimed or utilised
as demonstrated by the
behaviour of the shareholder recipients of the imputation credits.
While we reject the AER’s submission that the Tribunal exceeded the limits
of its jurisdiction by failing to make a clear finding
that a s 71C ground
of review was made out, since we think it is clear that the Tribunal proceeded
on the basis that the relevant
ground was error of construction leading to
errors of discretion, we accept the AER’s submission the Tribunal’s
to gamma was underpinned by a misunderstanding on its part about how
In our opinion the
Tribunal assumed that other parameters in the WACC calculations were market
values that already incorporated investors’
tax positions and transaction
costs but that misconstrued the “post-tax” framework. The rules
required gamma to be determined
consistently with return on equity.
In our opinion, it was not therefore a reviewable error for the AER to prefer
one theoretical approach to considering the determination
of gamma over another.
This means that it is not an error of construction for the AER to focus on
utilisation rather than on implied
market value. This is not to say that the
AER’s approach to gamma is immune from (limited) merits review. For
example, if it
erred in principle and thereby omitted to take into account a
mandatory relevant consideration or arrived at a conclusion which meant
decision was unreasonable within the meaning of s 71C(1)(d) of the NEL, the
Tribunal may intervene. It may also be that
the AER would err within
s 71C(1)(c) or (d) in acting on economic learning outside the mainstream of
that discipline, at least if
it did so without explaining the basis for so
Ground 17 is made out.
169 to 170 [759] to [767], the Full Court considered Ground 18 of the
grounds of review. The Full Court said:
Ground 18 was, in summary, that the Tribunal failed to
consider or address significant aspects of the reasons for the AER’s
decision in relation to the valuation of imputation credits. The ground referred
to the detailed consideration which the AER had
given to why the tax statistics
published by the ATO could be used to give a point estimate for gamma, rather
than merely providing
an upper bound or check. The ground also referred to the
AER considering in detail the appropriate use of market value studies generally
and the SFG study in particular and providing reasons for its conclusions as to
the appropriate use to make of such studies.
These matters were said to involve the Tribunal not having jurisdiction to make
its decision, that its decision was not authorised
Tribunal’s decision involved an error of law and that the Tribunal’s
decision was otherwise contrary to law:
see paragraphs (c), (d), (f) and (j) of
s 5(1) of the
In substance, as we understood it, the complaint here was that the Tribunal had
exceeded the jurisdiction available to it on the
limited merits review
established by s 71C of the
. In our opinion it would not be a
legal error on the part of the Tribunal to fail to deal with the entirety of the
reasons given
by the AER for its use of tax statistics where, for example, the
Tribunal found, on limited merits review, that an error on the part
displaced those reasons. Similarly, in our opinion, it would not be a legal
error on the part of the Tribunal to fail
to deal with the entirety of the
reasons given by the AER on the appropriate use of market value studies where
the Tribunal found,
on limited merits review, that an error on the part of the
AER displaced those reasons.
In our opinion, this is what the Tribunal did. We again refer to
: see [278] above.
In relation to tax statistics, the Tribunal concluded that as a matter of
principle tax statistics can only provide an upper bound
on the estimate of
theta. It stated at [1095] that the AER’s tax statistics approach made no
attempt to assess the value of
imputation credits to shareholders and ignored
the likely existence of factors which reduced the value of imputation credits
all eligible shareholders below the “face” value assumed by
the AER. The Tribunal considered that approach to be inconsistent
with a proper
interpretation of the Officer Framework underlying r 6.5.3 of the
The Tribunal said, in the same paragraph, it was the reason that the theta
estimates produced by the tax statistics could be no
better than upper bounds on
the market value of imputation credits.
We see no separate legal error on the part of the Tribunal in so concluding. In
our opinion, it stands or falls with the construction
issue raised by ground 17.
The Tribunal was not required, in light of that approach, to give further
consideration to the AER’s
reasons for using the tax statistics as it did.
The Tribunal anchored its conclusion in an available ground of limited merits
within s 71C.
In relation to market value studies, the Tribunal explained at [1049] that
market studies of the value of imputation credits was
the third source of
estimates of the utilisation rate. It referred, at [1092], to the value of theta
produced not only by taxation
statistics, but also by market value studies to
some extent, was evidence that Australian investors did not value imputation
at their face value, including because they may be unable to use them.
Then, at [1095], the Tribunal said that the AER’s approach
inconsistent with a proper interpretation of the Officer Framework underlying
r 6.5.3 of the
. It followed, the Tribunal said at [1096], that
the assessment of theta must rely on market studies. It said that of the various
methodologies for estimating gamma employed by the AER, market value studies
were best placed to capture the considerations that
investors made in
determining the worth of imputation credits to them. At [1097], the Tribunal
said that it considered the use of
market studies to estimate the value of
imputation credits was consistent with the method used to calculate other
parameters of the
costs of debt and equity from market data.
We see no separate legal error on the part of the Tribunal in so concluding. The
Tribunal was not required, in light of that approach,
to give further
consideration to the AER’s reasons for its conclusions as to the
appropriate use to make of market value studies.
The Tribunal anchored its
conclusion in an available ground of limited merits review within
In our opinion ground 18 is not made out as a separate source of legal error on
the part of the Tribunal.

Consideration
we have already mentioned at [110] above, the parties to the present matter were
invited to make written submissions in relation
to the impact of the Full
Court’s decision in
AER v ACT (No 2)
and did so pursuant to
that invitation.
owners accepted in its submissions that market-value estimates of gamma ought
not to form
“the sole basis”
for determining theta.
Nonetheless, they persisted with their challenge to the ERA’s final
owners went on to submit that the ERA’s model used in the present case did
not ignore or fail to incorporate personal transaction
costs whereas the
AER’s position in
AER v ACT (No 2)
reflected in
is that modelling of the relevant costs is not required because they
are already reflected in asset prices. For this reason, the
owners submitted
that the decision of the Full Court does not determine the outcome of the
present case.
owners then submitted that the ERA in the present case had adopted an unorthodox
approach by not estimating a complex weighted
average but rather a simple
average and thus acted on economic learning outside the mainstream of the
relevant disciplines. This
argument is new and has never been raised before
either with the ERA or before this Tribunal.
owners endeavoured to persuade the Tribunal that resort to tax statistics was
still available for the purposes of assessing the
value of imputation credits
under r 87A. The ultimate submission in this regard was that consideration
of tax statistics was permissible
and might lead the Tribunal to determine a
different value for gamma, even accepting the ERA’s theoretical framework,
and focussing
solely on the issue of tax statistics as an upper bound for gamma.
owners accepted that the Full Court’s decision had implications for those
aspects of the owners’ application relying
on the plain meaning of the
“the value of imputation credits”
. However, they went
on to submit that the decision of the Full Court did not otherwise determine the
Tribunal’s assessment
of the gamma topic. They went on to submit that the
Tribunal ought to consider three topics. These were adumbrated at pars 29
31 of the owners’ Written Submissions dated 12 July 2017 in the
following terms:
, whether the ERA erred in failing to
indicate where and how it has considered relevant transaction costs associated
with imputation
credits, if not explicitly in the formulation of a gamma
whether the ERA’s use of a simple rather than a complex
weighted average, as required by the theoretical framework, represents
“economic learning outside the mainstream of that discipline” and,
if so, whether that has been sufficiently well-explained
to avoid error.
, whether the Tribunal’s finding in
PIAC and Ausgrid
that tax statistics form an upper bound even within the theoretical framework
used by the ERA, which finding has not been disturbed
by the Full Court, has
implications for the gamma value (even if the ERA’s principal point as to
value is accepted). In particular,
based on the material before this Tribunal,
including issues as to the reliable use of FAB data, is 0.4 a feasible value for
or should it be reduced to 0.34?
ERA submitted that the Full Court’s decision in
disposes of the primary ground of review relied upon by the
owners in its Review Application. That ground was that the ERA erred
construing and applying the phrase
“the value of imputation
submitted by the ERA, the Full Court relevantly found that:
(a) The method,
sources of information and/or weight to be attributed to each data source when
determining
“the value of imputation credits”
is a derivative
of the interpretation of that term (at [742]).
“the value of imputation credits”
construed as a whole, in its statutory context and having regard to the subject
matter of the exercise. It would be an
error to limit attention to the word
and give it a meaning in isolation. The relevant
context is the function of the imputation credits under the NER (and, by
under the NGR) in relation to the return on capital and the tax
building block and, in particular, the determination of a regulated
return using
a post-tax revenue model based on a nominal vanilla WACC. The NER (and NGR)
require consistency in the way the relevant
building blocks interact (at [744],
[751] and [752]).
(c) It is a
misconstruction of the expression
“the value of imputation
to interpret
derived from market studies rather than a value within a
post-tax revenue model in which the integers are determined on a consistent
basis (at [753] and [755]).
(d) It was not
an error of construction for the AER (and, by analogy, the ERA in this case) to
prefer one theoretical approach to
considering the determination of gamma over
another. Specifically, the AER did not err by focussing on the utilisation of
credits rather than on an implied market value (at [756]).
ERA submitted that the effect of the decision of the Full Court is that the
ERA’s interpretation of the phrase
“value of imputation
was correct and that the interpretation of that phrase given
by the Tribunal in
PIAC and Ausgrid
was incorrect. That conclusion
removed the primary argument being advanced before us, namely, that the matter
had been correctly
decided by the Tribunal in
PIAC and Ausgrid
this Tribunal should follow that decision.
ERA criticised the submissions made by the owners in their Written Submissions
dated 12 July 2017 to the effect that the ERA’s
model differed from
the modelling framework adopted by the AER. Here, the ERA submitted that the
owners had put the opposite position
in their Submissions-in-Chief. The ERA
argued that, in the present case, the owners should not be permitted to depart
position. In any event, there was sufficient material before us for
us to be satisfied that the substance of the model deployed
by the AER in
PIAC and Ausgrid
is the same as that deployed by the ERA in the present
its Written Submissions dated 2 August 2017, the ERA submitted that the
owners’ argument that the ERA’s approach to
“unorthodox”
and outside the
“mainstream of the
relevant discipline”
is a new argument not previously been raised. We
agree. No leave has been sought to raise this argument and we do not propose to
entertain it.
any event, as the ERA submitted, this new submission made by the owners is
inconsistent with submissions made to this Tribunal
at the hearing in the sense
that, when they accepted (as they did) that the approach of the AER in
and Ausgrid
was the same as the approach of ERA in the present case, the
owners were also accepting that that approach was within the mainstream
ERA submitted that, in any event, Dr Lally had expressly said that he
concurred with the AER’s approach of simplifying the
averaging over the
utilisation rates of all investors because it is difficult to estimate
differences across investors in their level
of risk aversion (because individual
investors’ levels of risk aversion are not observable).
ERA submitted in its Written Submissions of 2 August 2017 that the Full
Court’s decision also disposed of the owners’
challenge to the
ERA’s use of tax statistics. We agree with that submission.
any event, the ERA repeated its submissions made at the hearing before us to the
effect that the uncontradicted evidence in the
economic literature considered by
the ERA was that there was some unexplained discrepancy in the tax statistics
date. This is revealed
in Professor Hathaway’s paper
Imputation Credit
Redemption ATO Data
1988–2011, Where have all the Credits
, September 2013. According to the ERA, Professor Hathaway’s
advice was unequivocal. He said:
Until [reconciliation of the discrepancy] has occurred
or it can be explained for me how to account for those credits, I urge all
caution in using ATO statistics for
estimates of parameters concerned
with franking credits [emphasis added].
the Full Court found in

Serious issue to be heard and determined
[39]–[42] in
Re Application by ElectraNet Pty Limited
[2008] ACompT
, the Tribunal held that the concept of “
a serious issue to be heard
and determined
” should be analysed and applied by reference to the
learning and principles applicable to the grant of interlocutory injunctions.
In that case, the Tribunal also held that it is a concept found in
s 237(2)(d)
Corporations Act 2001
(Cth) which concerns the
power of the Court to grant leave to a party to bring a statutory derivative
action on behalf of a company.
The relevant question is whether an applicant
has established that there is a serious issue to be heard and determined given
nature of the rights asserted by the applicant and “
the practical
consequences likely to flow
” from the grant of leave. In particular,
the Tribunal has, on a number of occasions, expressed the view that the
merely requires the applicant to “
show that there is a
sufficient prospect of success to justify in the circumstances it being given
the opportunity
” to have the decision reviewed (see

February 2017, when we granted leave to the owners to apply for a review of the
ERA’s decision, the Tribunal’s decisions
PIAC and Ausgrid
SA Power Networks
had already been handed down. In
addition, at that time, other decisions relating to the NEL were under
consideration. In each
of these Tribunal decisions, the question of gamma was
considered. In
PIAC and Ausgrid
the Tribunal determined that the AER was
in error in deciding a value for gamma of 0.40. In
itself accepted that it was in error in applying a gamma of 0.40. By way of
contrast, the Tribunal in
SA Power Networks
considered that the AER had
not erred, or been unreasonable, in adopting a value of 0.40 for gamma. The
issue of the correct figure
for gamma was under consideration in other matters
before the Tribunal which, as at February 2017, had not been determined.
addition, in
PIAC and Ausgrid
, the question of the suitability of the
SL-CAPM was at issue. Although the specific issues raised in that matter in
respect of return
on equity were slightly different from those raised in the
present matter, nonetheless the broad question of how the Tribunal should
play in that matter.
light of the matters to which we have referred at [350]-[355], we formed the
view that the owners had met the threshold test specified
in s 248(a) of
the NGL (WA).
Materially preferable designated NGO decision
meaning of the expression “
materially preferable designated NGO

particularly canvassed in ss 23, 244 and 259(4a)(c) of the NGL (WA). In
present case, given the amounts at stake, it seems to us that, were we to
grant the relief sought by the owners, it would result
in such a decision.
Revenue threshold
249(2) of the NGL (WA) provides, in effect, that the Tribunal must not grant
leave unless the amount that is specified in
or derived from the decision

revenue of the covered pipelines

more than satisfied this

was no suggestion that s 251 of the NGL (WA), which allows the Tribunal to
refuse to grant leave if the owners had conducted
themselves inappropriately
during the regulatory process in the respects adumbrated in that section, was
engaged in the present case.
all of the above reasons, we granted leave to the owners to apply for a review
