Reasons for Decision
All evidence has been
reviewed and only the evidence relevant to deciding this application is
mentioned in these reasons for decision.
Is keeping the pet likely to
pose an unacceptable risk to the health and safety of a person?
deciding whether the requested pet would pose an unacceptable risk to the health
and safety of a person, the Commissioner must
consider the following two
a risk to the health and safety of a person exist?; and
so, is the risk unacceptable?
The first question requires
evidence of the risk. This could include proof that the requested pet is
venomous, or a medical diagnosis
confirming an allergy caused by exposure to the
The second question involves assessing whether
the risk is unacceptable. The Macquarie Dictionary defines unacceptable as
far from a required standard, norm, expectation, etc., as not to be
This question requires the Commissioner to assess the
likelihood of the risk eventuating, and the gravity of the risk that may
The landlord must demonstrate that the risk is likely to occur and
that the consequences are serious enough to be considered
‘unacceptable’.
Does a risk to the health and safety of a
person exist?
The landlords submit they both have asthma and that
[redacted]’s asthma is more severe. In their application to the
Commissioner,
the landlords stated:
Both landlords are severally
allergic to dogs and as such, entering the property for necessary tasks could
bring on an asthma attack
with potentially major health repercussions.
On 1 September 2024, the landlords supplied a medical certificate from
[redacted] which states:
[redacted] suffers with asthma which [redacted] has noticed is aggravated by
exposure to dog hair. As such it is best if [redacted]
refrains from contact
with dogs and dog hair.
The medical certificate from [redacted] confirms
[redacted] suffers from asthma. The medical certificate states that [redacted]
the GP that [redacted] has noticed [redacted]’s asthma is
aggravated by dog hair.
Is the risk unacceptable?
The GP relaying
what they have been told by [redacted] is insufficient medical evidence to
support the claim that [redacted]’s
asthma is aggravated by dog hair. The
medical certificate also does not provide information about the level of risk to
[redacted]’s
health if [redacted] asthma was aggravated by exposure to the
requested pet or its hair. Given this, I have insufficient evidence
to conclude
that this risk is unacceptable.
No medical evidence has been provided
On 16 September 2024, Consumer Protection wrote to the landlords
and advised them of our preliminary view; that that the medical certificate
provided on 1 September 2024 did not demonstrate that the requested pet would
pose an unacceptable risk to the health and safety
of a person. The landlords
were given a further 14-days to provide additional medical evidence to
substantiate this ground. The landlords
did not provide Consumer Protection with
any additional evidence during the 14-day window.
Having regard to all
the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the requested pet is likely to
cause an unacceptable risk to
the health and safety of a person.
Condition – the requested pet is to be removed from the
premises during all routine inspections
While I am not satisfied that the
requested pet is likely to cause an unacceptable risk to the health and safety
of a person, I acknowledge
that the landlord's medical certificate recommends it
is best if [redacted] refrains from contact with dogs and dog
Accordingly, I have decided to impose a condition requiring the
tenant to remove the requested pet from the premises during all routine
inspections.
This condition is unlikely to be onerous for the tenant, as
a routine inspection can only occur a maximum of four times per year.
This condition will ensure the landlord is not exposed to the requested
pet during routine inspections.
A tenant or landlord
who is dissatisfied with this decision can appeal to the Magistrates Court of
Western Australia within seven
days after receiving this decision, or a later
date with leave from the Court.
The appeal can be started by lodging both
