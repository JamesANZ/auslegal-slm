Aboriginality of Victims
Factors arising from Offender’s Aboriginal Background Considered
by the Court
The offender:
had a difficult
childhood [165(vi)];
was suspended
from primary school on a number of occasions, and was expelled from secondary
school in year 10 [165(vi)];
left home at 16
years of age [165(vi)]; and
had engaged in
some short term unskilled work [165(vi)].
The appeal was dismissed 2:1 (Murrell CJ dissenting).
The offences occurred on 3 May 2012. At about 4:00pm, the offender/appellant
stole and hot-wired a vehicle from a public car park
while under the influence
of alcohol and cannabis [11].
The offender first performed a burnout near an oval with the vehicle [12].
The offender then drove towards an intersection where he
caused the vehicle to
collide with another stationary vehicle and failed to stop [12]. The offender
then drove erratically to a service
station where he stopped and filled his
vehicle with petrol, and left at high speed without paying [12]. Police
subsequently observed
the damaged vehicle and later activated their sirens [12].
The offender then approached Canberra Hospital in the vehicle and struck
first victim causing her to propel forward and the second victim who died
instantly while they were crossing a road on a walk
signal [15]. The offender
failed to stop, and continued to drive until his vehicle collided with a 4-wheel
drive, forcing the offender
to stop [16]. The offender was attempting to flee on
foot when he was apprehended by police [16].
At the time the offender was on conditional liberty [119].
Offender’s circumstances
The offender was 24 years old at the time of the offences [129].
The offender had a difficult childhood and was suspended from primary school
on a number of times and was expelled from secondary
school in year 10 without
completing the year [165(vi)]. The offender moved out of home at 16 years of age
[165(vi)] and since leaving
school, had engaged in short periods of unskilled
work [165(vi)].
While the offender enjoyed good physical health [17] at the time of committal
of the offences, he suffered from a range of mental
health conditions
[165(vii)]. These were either Asperger syndrome or Schizotypal personality
disorder; substance abuse disorder
due to alcohol and cannabis; XYY chromosome
disorder; anti-social personality disorder; temporal lobe epilepsy; and
depression and
anxiety [165(vii)].
Aboriginal Customary Law issues raised
Not applicable.
Aboriginal Cultural Practice or kinship issues raised
Not applicable.
Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and / or indicators of disadvantage
No comments about Aboriginality were made.
At first instance, Nield AJ referred to the offender's poor mental health and
determined that the offender's mental health did not
reflect on the offender's
moral culpability nor did it inform the sentencing objectives of personal and
general deterrence [68].
Nield AJ also found that there was no evidence to
support the proposition that the offender's mental health would make prison life
particularly difficult for him [68]. Nield AJ also held that the offender's
mental health did not cause the offender to commit the
offences and that
personal and general deterrence remained important sentencing objectives [172].
On appeal, Ross J stated that the equivocal nature of the evidence regarding
the offender's mental health mitigating the seriousness
of the offender's
actions meant that Nield AJ's conclusion that there was a no causal link between
the offender's mental health and
the offending conduct was reasonably open and
did not disclose any error [178].
Ross J also cited
Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa
(2010) 79 NSWLR 1 for the proposition that an offender's moral culpability
may be reduced in circumstances where the state of their
mental health
contributes to the commission of the offence. However, absent a causal link
between the offender's mental health and
the commission of the offence, the
opportunity for reducing moral culpability does not arise [179].
Ross J held that the range and extent of the mental health problems of the
offender called for less emphasis to be placed on the need
for general
deterrence during sentencing [180].
On appeal, Murrell CJ stated that the fact of the offender suffering from
"significant" mental health conditions was relevant as part
of the general
subjective circumstances of the offence [69, 98].
Relevant passage(s):
"Mr Monfries' mental health conditions and deprived background are factors
which may be said to sensibly moderate general deterrence
and mitigate the
punishment for these offences, but his extensive criminal history, lack of
remorse and the fact that he did not
have good prospects of rehabilitation all
suggest that personal deterrence and the need to protect the community loomed
the synthesis of sentencing considerations" [Ross J at 183].
Grounds of Appeal:
The offender's sentences for the offences of culpable driving causing death
and taking a vehicle without consent were manifestly excessive
Appeal Outcome:
Burns and Ross JJ dismissed the appeal, with Murrell CJ dissenting.
Murrell CJ (in the minority) held that the offender's sentence for the
offence of culpable driving causing death was manifestly excessive
this conclusion, Murrell CJ pointed to the following factors:
offence was of high objective seriousness, it was not in the objectively "close
to worst case" category;
subjective circumstances and, in considering the objective and subjective
circumstances and the s 33 factors, the case
was not in the "close to worst
case" category that would justify a maximum penalty;
The sentence
does not comfortably sit with the sentence for culpable driving causing grievous
bodily harm;
discount was very low, given the utilitarian value of the guilty plea of the
offender's criminal and driving records disentitled him to leniency, they could
not serve to increase the otherwise appropriate
sentence; and
The offender's
additional offences were not such as to greatly increase the otherwise
appropriate sentence [110].
Burns J held that the sentence imposed
on the offender constituted stern punishment and noted that Nield AJ considered
that the culpable
driving causing death offence was close to the worst type of
offence of its kind [153]. Looking at the aggravating circumstances
offence, Burns J was not persuaded that Nield AJ was incorrect in his sentencing
Ross J held that the test to be applied in an appeal for the sole ground of
manifest excessiveness of the sentence is whether a sentence
was imposed that
was above the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence
[225]. While Ross J would not have
imposed such a stern sentence, this was not
the test to be applied, he was not satisfied that the sentence imposed was above
range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence [225].
