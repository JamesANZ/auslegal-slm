hearing was conducted on 17 October 2011. Mr Sullivan and Mrs Sullivan attended
the hearing by conference telephone and gave
sworn evidence. The Child Support
Registrar was not present.
DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
17 October 2011 the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review. This
means the application is not successful.
DATE OF DESPATCH
October 2011
REASONS FOR DECISION
Sullivan and Mrs Sullivan are the parents of, relevantly, Emily, born 1995, who
is recorded as being in Mrs Sullivan’s greater
than primary
administrative assessment for the period from 1 October 2010 was for the payment
of $8,685 per annum by Mr Sullivan, based on
an adjusted taxable income for him
of $60,032 (based on his 2008/09 taxable income).
24 February 2011 Mr Sullivan advised that he had ceased work on 27 December 2010
and he lodged an estimate of income of $8,120
per annum for the period 24
February 2011 to 30 June 2011. The CSA accepted this estimate of income which
resulted in an assessment
for Mr Sullivan to pay the fixed annual rate of child
support for this period.
24 February 2011 Mr Sullivan also applied for the fixed annual rate of child
support not to be applied from that date. On 1 April
2011 the CSA granted that
application. This resulted in an assessment for Mr Sullivan to pay the minimum
annual rate of child support
($360 per annum) during the period 24 February 2011
to 30 June 2011.
24 May 2011 Mrs Sullivan objected to the decision and, on 22 June 2011, was
granted an extension of time within which to do so.
On 8 August 2011 an
objections officer allowed the objection so that the fixed annual rate of child
support applied for the period
24 February 2011 to 30 June
30 August 2011 Mr Sullivan applied to have the objection decision reviewed by
the Tribunal.
CONSIDERATION
Tribunal has carefully considered the sworn evidence given by Mr Sullivan and
Mrs Sullivan, as well as the subsection 95(3) statement
and documents provided
by the CSA (Exhibit 1), additional documents provided by Mrs Sullivan, marked
pages B1 – 29 (Exhibit
B) and the subsection 95(5) statement and documents
supplied by the CSA, marked pages C1 – C10 (Exhibit C). The salient parts
of the evidence will be outlined below.
The legislative
section 65A
Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989
(the Assessment
Act), a fixed annual rate of child support applies where
relevantly:
parent did not receive an income support payment in the last relevant year of
income; and
parent’s adjusted taxable income in the last relevant year of income is
less than the pension PP (single) maximum
basic amount; and
parent does not have at least shared care of the child.
was no dispute that the requirements of section 65A were met. Mr Sullivan did
not receive an income support payment in the last
relevant year of income (in
relation to the assessment commencing 1 October 2010). A fixed annual rate was
therefore correctly applied
to the assessment pursuant to that
paying parent may apply under section 65B of the Assessment Act for section 65A
not to apply in their particular case. Section
65B relevantly
65B Application for section 65A not to apply
(1) If the Registrar makes an assessment of an annual rate of child support
payable by a parent for a day in a child support period
under section
(a) the parent may apply to the Registrar for the section not to apply
(2) The parent making the application must provide evidence to the Registrar
concerning the parent’s income (within the meaning
of subsection 66A(4))
to demonstrate that his or her current income is:
(a) less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount;
(b) that it would be unjust and inequitable to expect him or her to pay
the amount assessed under this section.
(3) An assessment issued by the Commissioner of Taxation for the last
relevant year of income shall not be sufficient evidence of
the income of the
parent for the purposes of this section.
(4) If the parent makes an application, the Registrar may determine in
writing that the section not apply to the parent if the parent’s
income (within the meaning of subsection 66A(4)) is less than the pension PP
(single) maximum basic amount and it would be
unjust and inequitable to expect
him or her to pay the amount assessed under this
Note: If the Registrar refuses to grant an application under this
section, the Registrar must serve a notice on the applicant under
(5) The Registrar must specify the day in the child support period on which
the section ceases to apply to the parent. The day may
be any day from the first
day of the child support period on which an annual rate of child support under
section 65A became payable
by the parent.
can be seen from subsection 65B(2), there are two requirements which must be met
in order for the fixed annual rate under section
65A not to apply. The first
requirement is that the person’s “current income” must be less
than the pension PP
(single) maximum amount (which for 2010 is $14,937 and for
2011 is $15,909). Although not defined in the Assessment Act, policy
contained in the CSA’s
, at chapter 2.5.3, state that
“current income” is taken to mean the person’s income for the
12 month period from
the date of their application. The second requirement in
subsection 65B(2) is that “it would be unjust and inequitable”
expect the person to pay the fixed annual rate. On this issue, the CSA’s
, again at chapter 2.5.3, states:
In making this decision, CSA will consider whether the parent’s
income accurately reflects their real capacity to pay child
support, including
whether the parent receives goods, services or benefits which mean that
their current income is not an
accurate representation of their
financial position. CSA may decide that it would not be unjust and inequitable
to require the
parent to pay the fixed annual rate despite their income being
Whether the fixed rate of child support should not
apply to Mr Sullivan
relation to his current income, Mr Sullivan originally told the Tribunal that he
received no income during the period 24 February
2011 to 30 June 2011. Upon
further questioning by the Tribunal based upon his bank statements, Mr Sullivan
agreed that he received
one payment of Newstart allowance of $161.42 on 25 March
2011 and he also did some work for a company on a monthly basis from mid-June
2011 with income averaging about $161 for each occasion.
Sullivan told the Tribunal that he only received one payment of Newstart
allowance as Centrelink asked him to provide details about
the income of Tracey
Mitchell, who was said to be his partner, but he could not provide those details
as she was not his partner.
Sullivan advised that Tracey Mitchell is a business owner who also works with
other people. He has worked with her on three or
four occasions but has received
no money for such work.
said that during the relevant time he used the savings he had in his bank
account to support himself, including paying his car
loan. He submitted that, as
he had been paying about $260 per week in child support for some two years prior
to this time, Mrs Sullivan
should have been putting money aside so she had funds
to care for Emily whilst Mr Sullivan was unemployed. He stated that he should
only be assessed to pay the minimum annual rate of child support during the
relevant period as he was living off his savings and
was unsure when he would
next receive income.
Sullivan told the Tribunal that Mr Sullivan was linked to Tracey
Mitchell’s enterprises. She said that, up until a couple
of months ago, Mr
Sullivan and Tracey were recorded as being engaged but that is no longer the
case. She said that she spent the
child support being paid by Mr Sullivan on
private school fees, tutoring and rent.
Sullivan agreed that he was engaged to Tracey Mitchell for a time after the
period being considered but they are no longer together.
He stated that whilst
they were together they had a joint bank account into which they each deposited
funds to meet the household
expenses. They did not however share
Tribunal accepts that during the relevant period Mr Sullivan’s only
sources of income were one payment of Newstart allowance
and some small payments
from employment from the middle of June 2011. The Tribunal finds that Mr
Sullivan’s current income
is less than the relevant pension PP (single)
maximum basic amount.
the fixed annual rate which applied from 24 February 2011 to 30 June 2011
constituted a liability of just over $400 for that
period. Mr Sullivan’s
bank statements show that in his bank account he had funds of about $15,000 at
the start of that period
and about $6,500 as at the middle of June 2011. Whilst
the Tribunal accepts that Mr Sullivan largely lived off his savings during
time, the Tribunal is not satisfied it is unjust and inequitable that he be
assessed to pay just over $400 for the support of
Emily during this time, an
amount he could readily meet from the funds in his bank
Tribunal therefore finds that the requirements of section 65B of the Assessment
Act have not been met and the fixed annual rate
of child support should be
objections officer’s decision is therefore
On 17 October 2011 the
Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review. This means the application
is not successful.
