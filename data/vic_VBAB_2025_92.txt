Woolcock Registrar M Finlay
Applicants are the owners of the land at 344 Heaths Road, Hoppers Crossing.
Applicants made an application to the Building Appeals Board (
pursuant to
Building Act 1993
To modify Clause A6G1 Exemption 1 of the Building Codes
[sic] of Australian [sic] Volume 2 2022, which permits a part of a building
has been designed, constructed or adapted for a different purpose and is less
than 10% of the floor area of the storey it is
situated on, to adopt the
classification of the other part of the storey and apply the classification to
the whole storey, applying
to a Class 1a building, namely; to permit the
proposed salon to adopt the same building classification as the remainder of the
being Class 1a, whilst being equivalent to 19.5% of the floor area of
the storey it is situated on, in lieu of less than 10%, as
indicated in the
submission. The proposed salon will be 27.37 m
in lieu of the
maximum of 14.039 m
required to comply with the exemption under
Clause A6G1.
BAB, on its own motion, determined the following question in the affirmative, in
the form of the Preliminary Determination and
Orders dated 26 June 2025 (
Preliminary Determination
Is Exemption (1) of
the governing requirement A6G1 a provision of the
Regulations 2018
within the meaning of
Building Act 1993
, that is can the BAB modify
or vary the Exemption (1) of
requirement A6G1(1)
Building Code of Australia
in an application made pursuant to s 160(2)(b)
of the Act?
the Preliminary Determination, the matter was referred to us to determine
whether the relief sought should be granted.
concur with the findings of the Preliminary Determination in that Exemption
(1) of the governing requirement A6G1 is a provision
Building Regulations 2018
the Regulations
the meaning of
of the Act.
Notwithstanding
the above, we do not find that it is reasonable and not detrimental to the
public interest to modify or vary that
provision for the reasons that
requires the relevant building surveyor to determine the classification of a
governing requirements under A6G1 of the
Building Code of Australia 2022
) state, in part...
(1) The classification of a building or part of a building is determined by the
purpose for which it is designed, constructed or
adapted to be used.
(2) Each part of a building must be classified according to its purpose and
comply with all the appropriate requirements for its
classification.
governing requirement A1G4(3)(f) states that an Exemption statement is mandatory
and is provided to specify when a provision does
not need to be complied
existing part of the garage is presumably a Class 10a structure, whereas the
proposed salon would likely be classified as Class
area for the proposed salon is not part of the ‘dwelling’ and
greatly exceeds 10% of the floor area of the building.
find that the ‘relief sought’ wherein the applicant is seeking
‘[t]o permit the proposed salon to have the same
building classification
as the remainder of the dwelling, being Class 1a’ is misconceived as we
observe that the existing part
of the garage is presumably a Class 10a
structure. Therefore, for the proposed salon to be classified as a Class 1a, the
part of the garage will need to undergo change of use pursuant to reg
229 of the Regulations.
Applicants have not made any submissions as to whether they intend to make an
application for the change of use and whether certain
building work is proposed
to convert the presumably Class 10a part of the garage to a habitable Class 1a
note that the requirements for a Class 6 building go beyond the habitable
threshold. In this case, that includes access, egress,
fire safety, energy
efficiency, health and amenity, particularly fire separation and
accessibility.
particular circumstances in this application are not unforeseen by the
Regulations. In fact, regs 229 and 233 of the Regulations
appropriately respond
to these circumstances.
find that it is not appropriate to modify a ‘Governing Requirement’
of the BCA such as a classification or a definition.
find that rather than modifying or varying exemption provision of the BCA, regs
229 and/or 233 provide a more appropriate pathway
under which the municipal
building surveyor or a private building
may holistically assess
the building or structure and determine whether to grant complete or partial
Accordingly,
we refuse the relief sought.
