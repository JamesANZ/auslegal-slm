T and V Payne v Forest Practices Authority [2010] TASFPT 1 (23 February 2010)
File No: 6/09 F D01/2010
T and V Payne Appellants
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was the hearing of an appeal against a decision of the Forest
Practices Authority for a Forest Practices Plan RSS0006 at Earlham
The appeal was heard at Hobart on 14
G Wilkinson and F Duncan appeared on behalf of the Forest
Practices Authority.
R Smith appeared on behalf of T and V
T Payne appeared in person
Practices Plan RSSS0006 (FPP or Plan) applied for clear felling and conversion
to plantation of approximately 208ha of native
forest and partial harvesting of
approximately 70ha of native forest.
Plan was composed and submitted on the Appellants’ behalf by Rob Smith,
Private Forests Advisor of Private Forests Tasmania.
The Forest Practices
Authority refused to certify the Plan.
the hearing before the Tribunal on 14 December 2009 the evidence in written and
oral form we thought was clear and succinct: this
was the primary reason why we
decided that it was not useful or necessary to take a ‘view’ of the
property subject of
Smith told us that in submitting the Plan he was aware that it involved
threatened community and threatened species issues. Dr
Bell’s evidence
was that the property subject of the Plan and the area of the Weilangta Forest
and more generally a narrow
coastal strip on the East Coast of Tasmania is the
main breeding and foraging area in Tasmania of the species Swift Parrot which
depends upon the presence of
Eucalyptus globulus
, the area and quality of which through clearance for agriculture,
timber harvesting and urban development has produced what he called
“massive loss”. Mr Payne objected that this was an emotive term,
but it does not embarrass us, nor the Tribunal which

D2/2007. But in case it did Dr Bell was prepared to describe the loss as
one of “large proportions” since European
settlement.
was stated at one stage that in the relevant area the number of Swift Parrots
were 1000 breeding pairs: Mr Payne said that he found
such a statement
“hard to believe” by which he meant to be understood as doubting the
possibility of such accuracy.
In so saying he embraced what has been called
‘the precautionary principle” on the content and meaning of which
materials were submitted.
‘precautionary principle’ is not difficult to understand and really
involves no more than “the rule of prudence
that any tribunal should act
with much care and caution before finding that a serious allegation such as that
of adultery is established
“ to use the language of Latham CJ in the High
Court of Australia
Briginshaw v Briginshaw
(1938) 60 C L R 330 at p347.
Substitute here “threat to species and communities” for
“adultery” and the rule
is apposite and we apply it, notwithstanding
that it is conceded and apparent that there is lack of statistical certainty in
quantifying
majority we find it well proved – are “comfortably satisfied”
– that the FPP involves clearance and conversion
of threatened forest
communities and threat to the endangered species Swift Parrot.
Nature Conservation Act
2002 the Appellants may apply for
compensation and the Minister will consider that in granting or refusing the
order of the Tribunal is that the appeal is dismissed: The FPA’s refusal
remains in effect.
