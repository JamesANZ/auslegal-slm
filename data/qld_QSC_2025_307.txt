[1] On 23 June
2025, I ordered that the contract between the parties be specifically performed
in this proceeding.
I held that Mr
and Ms Storey were entitled to specific performance of the contract in which
they contracted to buy a property at
Parrearra on the Sunshine Coast.
outstanding issue is costs.
[3] On 25 June
2025, I ordered that the parties deliver any costs submissions by 2 July 2025.
The defendants did not comply with
that order. On 22 October 2025, I gave the
defendants a further seven days from 22 October 2025 (to 29 October 2025) to
deliver any
costs submissions. The defendants did not deliver their submissions
on that date. By email to my Associate on 29 October 2025,
Ms Britton sought an
extension of a further 14 days from 29 October 2025. That extension was
objected to by the plaintiffs. Ms
Britton took no further steps to apply for an
extension. In any event, 14 days from 29 October 2025 has expired and the
have not delivered any costs submissions.
[4] The general
rule is that the costs of a proceeding are in the discretion of the court but
follow the event, unless the court orders
[5] The Storeys
were entirely successful at trial.
[6] Prior to the
trial, Mr Britton adopted a different stance to Ms Britton. However, by the time
of the trial Mr Britton had altered
his course and aligned his case with Ms
Britton’s case. Both defendants opposed specific performance and argued
that the contract
had been validly terminated.
[7] As counsel
for the Storeys submits, there is no reason for the court to depart from the
usual position, namely, that costs follow
[8] The next
question is whether the costs should be assessed on an indemnity basis or on a
standard basis. The Storeys seek costs
on the indemnity basis because of the
provisions of the contract.
failure of the Brittons to settle, the Storeys as the buyers affirmed the
contract. That affirmation then had the consequence
that, pursuant to clause 9.3
of the contract terms, the Storeys were entitled to sue the Brittons for
damages, or specific performance,
or damages and specific performance. The
Storeys entitlement to damages was dealt with in more detail in clause 9.8 which
“The Buyer may claim damages for any loss it
suffers as a result of the Seller’s default,
including its legal costs
on an indemnity basis
[emphasis added]
[9] Thus, on its
plain terms, clause 9.8 would entitle the Storeys to their legal costs of the
proceeding on an indemnity basis.
accepted principle is stated in
Chen v Kevin McNamara
& Son Pty Ltd (No. 2)
“An agreement to pay costs
will be construed as an agreement to pay costs on a party and party basis,
unless it is plain from
its terms that costs are to be paid on a ‘special
the terms plainly and
unambiguously provide for costs to be assessed on some special basis, the court
will take such a provision into
but it is not bound to give effect
to any extra-curial contract as to costs. An agreement to pay costs on a
basis is only a factor informing the exercise of the
court’s discretion, but not requiring the exercise of that discretion
particular way. Generally however, where the parties have unmistakeably agreed
to the making of a special costs order, such
a term will be given effect to
unless there is some other discretionary consideration that militates against
the making of such an
[emphasis added]
[11] Here, by
clause 9.8 of the contract the parties have plainly and unambiguously elected
that, in these circumstances, the Storeys
would be entitled to their costs on an
indemnity basis. It is relevant to note that, had the situation been reversed
and it was the
Storeys who had failed to complete their obligations, then the
Brittons would have been entitled to their costs on an indemnity
[12] Whilst
there is a discretion, the parties’ bargain about costs ought to be
respected. Thus, in
Platinum United II Pty Ltd v
Secured Mortgage Management Ltd (in liq)
Fraser JA observed that a court
would usually exercise the discretion to award costs otherwise than on the
standard basis so as to
give effect to a contractual provision which
‘plainly and unambiguously’ provides for taxation of costs on
another basis.
[13] One similar
case where indemnity costs were refused is
In that case
Holmes JA (with whom Fraser and White JJA agreed) considered clause 9.7 of the
standard REIQ contract which is an equivalent
provision for the seller’s
damages. Clause 9.7 provided that the seller may claim damages for any loss it
suffers as a result
of the buyer’s default, including its legal costs on
an indemnity basis.
provision is substantially the same as clause 9.8 here. Clause 9.7 and 9.8 are
mirror images, with clause 9.7 applying in
the event of a seller’s claim
for damages and clause 9.8 applying in the event of a buyer’s claim for
damages. However,
Willmott v McLeay
distinguishable. Under clause 9.7 and 9.8 of the standard REIQ contract, perhaps
surprisingly, the contractual entitlement to
claim indemnity costs is tied to
damages claims. That is clear from the fact that clause 9.8 gives the buyer a
right to claim damages
as a result of the seller’s default,
its legal costs on an indemnity basis. As Holmes JA pointed
out, the drafting of the entitlement to claim indemnity costs is expressed
of damages for loss resulting from the default of the other
contracting party.
That seems to
arise from the idea that the entitlement is to claim damages, including
indemnity costs. In
Willmott v McLeay
there was no claim for damages and
so Holmes JA was not persuaded that the parties had contracted “
and unambiguously
” for payment of costs on an indemnity
[15] Obviously
enough, clauses 9.7 and 9.8 could be better drafted by ensuring that the claims
to damages and the claim to indemnity
costs were independent of each other.
Clancy v Carlson
Dann DCJ distinguished
Willmott v McLeay
because in that case damages had been claimed and
I propose to adopt a
similar approach here.
[17] Damages
were claimed here as an alternative to specific performance. No damages were
awarded because the orders for specific
performance were sufficient for the
Storeys. As explained in the principal judgment the main issue was whether the
contract had been
validly terminated or remained on
The issue of damages was
put aside. However, the entitlement to claim damages and indemnity costs
[18] In any
event, applying the test in
Chen v Kevin McNamara & Son Pty Ltd (No.
, the terms of the contract here plainly and unambiguously provide for
costs on an indemnity basis.
[19] The order
will be that the defendants pay the plaintiffs’ costs of the proceeding on
an indemnity basis.
