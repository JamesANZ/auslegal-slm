national broadcasting service of the ABC or SBS, but exclude other transmissions
to the public such as on-demand
services, interactive services and computer
networking of material. The definition of broadcasting should be linked to the

to specific broadcasters and statutes and to provide that the owner
of copyright
in the broadcast is the person who makes the broadcast.
Section 22(5)

provide that the maker of a broadcast is the
person who is responsible for the

transmission. (Paragraph
(iii) Copyright protection should not be extended to transmissions other than
broadcasts in the extended sense proposed in Recommendation
2. (Paragraph
Recommendation 6: Transmissions Originating from Australia

reception by the public outside Australia, the maker of the
transmission should
be required to obtain the licence of the copyright owner in Australia to do so.
(Paragraph 3.3)
(ii) Broadcasts intended for reception by the public outside Australia but
originating in Australia should be the subject of copyright
protection in
Australia. (Paragraph 3.3)
Recommendation 7: Transmissions Intended for Reception in Australia

outside Australia but is intended for reception by the public

the CCG considers that the appropriate means of implementing such a right
further examination. (Paragraph 3.3)
(ii) The CCG recommends that broadcasts originating from countries outside
Australia and which are intended for reception in Australia,
should be the
subject of copyright protection in Australia. (Paragraph 3.3)

from which a satellite broadcast is made is the place from which the signals
carrying the broadcast are transmitted to the satellite. (Paragraph
Recommendation 9: Transmissions Originating from a Satellite
A new section should be inserted in the
provides that transmissions originating from a satellite which are directly and
lawfully receivable by the public in Australia
and intended for reception by
that public should be deemed to be made from Australia and therefore protected
as broadcasts in which
Recommendation 10: Retransmission of Broadcasts
Section 199(4)
should be replaced with
a section which allows for retransmission by any means of a broadcast (in the
extended sense suggested
in Recommendation 2) only in the following
circumstances:
(i) where the retransmission takes place within the intended reception area
of the primary broadcast; and
(ii) where the retransmission is simultaneous with the primary broadcast;
(iii) where the content of the primary broadcast is not altered in any way in
the retransmission; and
(iv) the retransmission is for the purpose of enabling reception of the
primary broadcast in areas where the signal quality of that
broadcast is
inadequate.
Consequent amendments will be required to
section 199(5)
, (6) and (7) of the
Act. (Paragraph 4.2) The CCG has also recommended complementary amendments to
section 212

Recommendation 11: Rebroadcast of Broadcasts (Section 25(3))
Retransmissions of broadcasts should be dealt with in a technology neutral
manner. All retransmissions should be dealt with in a

should be repealed.
Recommendation 12: Unauthorised Reception of Transmissions
Two new offences concerning unauthorised reception of transmissions should be

The CCG notes that these offences may possibly be more appropriately included
in Commonwealth Crimes legislation than the

for hire unauthorised decoding devices should be introduced.
(Paragraph 5.2) The
new civil right of action should:

for whose benefit such fees were collected, or the
maker of any encrypted
transmission;
(ii) lie against any person who makes, imports, sells or lets for hire the
unauthorised devices, and against any person who publishes
information
calculated to enable or assist any person who publishes information calculated
to enable or assist any persons to receive
services to which they are not
The same rights and remedies should be available against such persons as
would lie against copyright infringers. (Paragraph 5.2)
Recommendation 13: Incidental Cable Services Where Persons Reside or
Section 26(3) of the

inequitable in view of the
commercial reasons for such exploitation. The
provision should be repealed. (Paragraph 6.1)
Recommendation 14: Ephemeral Copying
The ephemeral copying provisions in the

review, should not be extended to all transmissions

broadcasters in
section 109

and that this should
take place as part of the wide ranging review of the Act which has been proposed
by the Minister for Justice.
