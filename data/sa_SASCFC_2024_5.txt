The Legal Profession Conduct Commissioner (the
Commissioner
orders that the name of Mark Adam Freer (the
practitioner
) be struck off
the roll of legal practitioners maintained under the
Legal Practitioners Act
(SA) (the Act), and that he pay costs.
The practitioner was admitted to practice in South Australia in February
In June 2021, the practitioner pleaded guilty to a charge of fabricating
evidence, contrary to
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
). In September 2022, the practitioner was found guilty by
a jury of a charge of aggravated theft, contrary to
of the CLCA. Both
offences were committed in circumstances directly related to the
practitioner’s practice as a legal practitioner.
Earlier, in March 2016, the practitioner misappropriated a client’s
money for his own benefit. In July 2017 the practitioner
made a false statutory
declaration without speaking to or meeting with the declarant which enabled a
fraudulent loan transaction.
The Commissioner determined that both incidents
comprised evidence of professional misconduct which could not adequately be
with under s 77J of the Act.
The practitioner consented to strike-off.
Held (the Court) striking the practitioner’s name from the roll of
practitioners:
a legal practitioner has been found guilty of serious offending involving
dishonesty and the misappropriation of trust monies,
that will usually
demonstrate a fundamental defect in the practitioner’s character,
rendering the practitioner unfit to practise.
The practitioner's professional misconduct, when viewed as whole, represents a
serious departure from the standards reasonably expected
from members of the
legal profession over a lengthy period. The Court cannot be confident that the
practitioner is capable of fulfilling
the essential obligations associated with
the practice of law.
The Court must, where possible, protect the public from legal practitioners who
act without honesty and integrity. It is essential
that the community and the
Court be able to rely upon the integrity and trustworthiness of legal
practitioners.

THE COURT (
Introduction
an originating application dated 5 November 2024, supported by an affidavit
sworn on 4 November 2024, the Legal Profession Conduct
Commissioner
Commissioner

the name of the practitioner be struck off the roll of legal practitioners
maintained under the
Legal Practitioners Act 1981
the practitioner pay the Commissioner’s costs to be agreed or
this matter was set down at a callover on 29 November 2024, the practitioner
indicated that he consented to an order striking
his name from the roll and he
asked to be excused from further attendance.
the reasons that follow, orders will be made in terms of the
Commissioner’s application.
Commissioner relies on
of the Act, which is in the following
89—Proceedings before Supreme Court
(1a) If the Commissioner is of the opinion that the name of a legal
practitioner should be struck off the roll of legal practitioners
under this Act or the roll kept in a participating State that corresponds to the
roll maintained under this Act because
the practitioner has been found guilty of
a serious offence, or for any other reason, the Commissioner may, without laying
before the Tribunal, institute disciplinary proceedings in the Supreme
Court against the practitioner.
Commissioner also relies, insofar as it may be necessary, on the inherent
of the Act.
will be seen, the practitioner was the subject of criminal proceedings in the
District Court and the Commissioner has invited
this Court to adopt the findings
made in the District Court concerning the sentence imposed by Judge Slattery on
31 January 2024,
of the Act.
practitioner is a “legal practitioner” within the meaning of
the Act because he is a person who was duly admitted and enrolled as a barrister
and solicitor of the Supreme Court of South Australia.
The practitioner was
admitted in South Australia on 16 February 2011.
practitioner was born on 28 May 1971 and is currently 53 years.
practitioner ceased legal practice during September 2016 and has not since held
a practising certificate.
29 June 2021, the practitioner pleaded guilty to a charge of fabricating
evidence, contrary to
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
). The practitioner admitted
creating and filing a false affidavit with the
intention of influencing the outcome of judicial proceedings.
14 September 2022, the practitioner was found guilty by a jury of a charge of
aggravated theft, contrary to
of the CLCA. The practitioner’s
appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 15 June
aggravated theft charge concerned the practitioner’s dealings with two
bank cheques totalling $67,500 in 2014. These had
been provided to him by his
cousin, a client, in the expectation that they would be deposited into the trust
account of the practitioner’s
employer. The practitioner did not deposit
the cheques into this trust account. Rather, he opened a new bank account in
of a business he controlled. He deposited the cheques into that
account and misappropriated the money for his own benefit until
the account was
overdrawn in January 2016.
12 February 2024, Judge Slattery made the following sentencing
The swearing of a false affidavit in the name of another
and the opportunistic theft by you as a solicitor of moneys from a client
close family member are extraordinary breaches of trust which constitute a gross
departure from the expected conduct of legal
practitioners in whom such trust is
placed. Such conduct brings the legal profession into disrepute in the eyes of
the wider community.
... your offending strikes at the heart of public confidence in the legal
profession and the administration of justice generally.
It should be made clear
to other legal practitioners in the community that such offending is inexcusable
and is to be regarded as
the most serious breaches of the professional
obligation to which all legal practitioners are beholden.
the practitioner was released on parole in June 2024, on 23 August 2024, the
Commissioner determined that the practitioner’s
conduct evidenced
professional misconduct and demonstrated that the practitioner was not fit to
addition, on 20 July 2017, the practitioner made a statutory declaration in
which he admitted witnessing signatures on a loan
agreement and associated
documents without ever meeting with or speaking to the declarant. That conduct
enabled a fraudulent loan
transaction to be completed and a mortgage to be
registered on the title of an innocent party. As a consequence of proceedings
the Supreme Court of Queensland, the mortgage and all associated loan and
security documents witnessed by the practitioner were declared
void and of no
26 June 2024, the Commissioner determined that this comprised evidence of
professional misconduct which could not be adequately
dealt with under s 77J of
the Act, and that it called into question the practitioner’s fitness to
in March 2016, the practitioner received trust monies from a client in the sum
of $15,790, on account of anticipated fees
and disbursements concerning an
application for a prospective marriage or partnership visa. The practitioner
did not complete the
visa application and misappropriated the client’s
money for his own benefit.
15 August 2024, the Commissioner determined that this comprised evidence of
professional misconduct which could not be adequately
dealt with under s 77J of
has been seen, the Commissioner relied upon s 89(1a) of the Act because he
formed the opinion that the name of the legal practitioner
should be struck-off
“because the practitioner has been found guilty of a serious offence, or
for any other reason”,
in which case he may institute disciplinary
proceedings in this Court without first laying a charge before the
Relevant principles
ultimate question for this Court is whether at the time of this application the
practitioner is fit to remain a member of the
profession.
law and the community require that legal practitioners exhibit honesty and
integrity in connection with their dealings concerning
trust accounts, trust
monies and the affidavits or declarations which they are empowered to take. It
is essential that the community
be able to rely upon the honesty and
trustworthiness of legal practitioners. That is essential to the professional
practice of the
legal practitioner’s trust account has always been regarded as sacred.
Where a client’s trust money is deliberately
used by a legal practitioner
for a purpose other than the purpose for which the client entrusted it to the
legal practitioner, the
legal practitioner is regarded as having acted
dishonestly.
Where a legal practitioner has been found guilty of
serious offending involving dishonesty and the misappropriation of trust monies,
that will usually demonstrate a fundamental defect in the practitioner’s
character, rendering the practitioner unfit to practise.
a legal practitioner is proved to have dishonestly misused trust monies for the
practitioner’s own benefit, this Court
will usually regard the breach of
trust involved as especially serious, entailing a failure to adhere to the high
standards expected
practitioners.
convictions for aggravated theft and perjury associated with the fraudulent
misappropriation of trust monies have been
regarded as demonstrating a gross
breach of trust, requiring an order striking the practitioner’s name from
a legal practitioner has knowingly sworn a false affidavit, that will usually
call into question the practitioner’s fitness
to practise the profession
of the law.
Proof that a
practitioner swore a false affidavit and took a false statutory declaration and,
in addition, dishonestly misappropriated
trust monies, will usually require
striking-off.
Determination of the Commissioner’s application
the practitioner does not oppose strike-off is relevant to, but not
determinative of, the resolution of the Commissioner’s
application.
practitioner misappropriated trust monies on two occasions, spanning two years
between 2014 and 2016. As well, in 2016 the practitioner
swore and filed a
false affidavit with the intention of influencing the outcome of judicial
proceedings and, separately, in 2017
he falsely witnessed a statutory
declaration, enabling a fraudulent mortgage and loan transaction.
conduct represents a course of dishonest dealings and professional misconduct
over a lengthy period, incompatible with the high
standards the law and the
community rightly expect from legal practitioners. The practitioner’s
professional misconduct, when
viewed as whole, represents a serious departure
from the standards reasonably expected from members of the legal
profession.
Court cannot be confident that the practitioner is capable of fulfilling the
essential obligations associated with the practice
Court must, where possible, protect the public from legal practitioners who act
without honesty and integrity. It is essential
that the community and the Court
be able to rely upon the honesty and trustworthiness of legal practitioners.
all of these circumstances, it is clear that the maintenance of public
confidence in the legal profession requires that an order
be made striking the
practitioner’s name from the roll maintained by this
will be an order striking the practitioner’s name from the roll.
