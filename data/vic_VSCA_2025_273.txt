total 290.5g of methylamphetamine (charge 1 — trafficking in a drug of

one 14.4g quantity and one

four times the commercial quantity by pure weight and also over the 250g mixed

applicant’s background was summarised as follows. His parents separated
when the applicant was three years of age. He lived
initially with his mother
who had alcohol issues. The applicant was exposed to violence from some of his
mother’s new partners.
He and his younger half siblings were removed from
her care. The applicant then lived with his father, but did not have a strong
relationship with him. He absconded from home and commenced drug use at an early
age. The applicant attended several different schools
and struggled
academically. He had a patchy employment history. He commenced an intimate
relationship when he was 19 years old. That
relationship produced two
daughters, aged 14 and 16 years at the time of sentence. Although the
applicant was separated from their

submits that the sentence on charge 2 is

imprisonment in cases where the offending comprised discharging, importing
possessing a traffickable quantity of firearms.

applicant accepted that ground 3 could not succeed unless grounds 1 and 2 were
successful.
Respondent’s
contentions
trafficking
respondent contends that the sentence imposed on charge 1 is not manifestly
excessive. The gravity of the offending was high.
That the charge was for single
date trafficking is unimportant given that the applicant was involved in a
significant, sophisticated
commercial drug operation. The respondent further
argues that gravity of the offending and the applicant’s moral culpability
were appropriately balanced by the judge with the modest factors upon which he
could rely in mitigation of penalty.

, the respondent notes that in
DPP v Condo
observed that there was no tension between what was said in
Fernando v The Queen
concerning the need for an uplift in current sentencing practices for offences
of trafficking in commercial quantities of drugs,
and what was said in
sentencing.
The respondent
further contends that it is clear from the sentencing remarks that the judge did
sentence the applicant by considering
all known aspects of him as an individual
and the crime he actually
respondent further contends that to the extent the applicant’s argument
relies upon the use of comparable cases, that is
limited by his very relevant
criminal history and associated poor prospects for rehabilitation.
Ground 2 — firearms
respondent contends that the evidence before the judge demonstrated that the
applicant’s possession of the firearm was for
the purpose of criminal
activity and therefore demanded a more severe
Further, the
applicant’s relevant criminal history was a matter a matter of some
significance in the sentencing exercise.

relevant authorities, demonstrate the judge understood
and applied the correct
principles.

articulated his reasons for the order for cumulation on

respondent argues that in addition to the appropriate individual sentences
imposed on charges 1 and 2, those on the remaining
charges were also
well within the available range. In his remarks the judge considered the
principle of totality at length
and the modest orders for cumulation demonstrate its application. Further, the
judge balanced all relevant factors in arriving at

particularly fraught, however, is with respect to the characteristics of each
offender, which necessarily give rise to different emphases in the weight given

need for community protection

total effective sentence of five years’
imprisonment with a
non-parole period of two years and nine months for charges of
trafficking in a drug of dependence, possessing
a drug of dependence, knowingly
dealing with the proceeds of crime, dealing with property suspected to be

an unregistered handgun and possession cartridge
ammunition without a licence. In 2019 the applicant received a total effective
of four years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of
two years and six months for charges of trafficking in a drug of

2019 sentence commenced within months of the applicant’s
release from
prison after serving the 2013 sentence. The instant offending, committed
proximate to the applicant’s last release
from custody, not only forms
part of the continuum of his drug offending over a decade whenever at liberty in
the community, but

the sentence on charge 1 is manifestly excessive,
it must be remembered
that ultimately manifest excess is a conclusion

reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently

is reasonably arguable the sentence imposed on
charge 1, although stern,
was wholly outside the range of sentences available to the judge. The applicant
came before the court as
an entrenched drug trafficker. Significant terms of
imprisonment had failed to deter him from like offending. He had limited matters
upon which to rely in mitigation of penalty. The nature of the methylamphetamine
trafficking enterprise was sophisticated. It produced
large profits.

Ground 2 — firearms
with respect to many offences, the approach to the assessment of firearm
possession exists on a spectrum. This Court has observed

possession of a firearm, at one end of the spectrum

unrelated to other criminal activities, and at the other end of the spectrum is

in the course of committing other criminal activity, but without the actual
threatened use of the weapon, falls towards the higher end of the

significant drug trafficking
enterprise. The criminality involved fell towards the higher end of the

and each case must be
assessed on its facts as to the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour
and the circumstances of the
offender, the applicant not only had relevant prior
convictions for possession of firearms but that possession was in the context
his prior drug trafficking. This factor alone is severely limiting of the
utility of the cases relied upon by the applicant as
comparators. Also, a number
of those authorities are complicated by the fact that the offender was also
sentenced for discharge of
the firearm.
the matters discussed generally under cover of ground 1 are relevant to the
analysis of this ground. In particular, the judge
was correct to emphasise the
need for specific deterrence of the applicant in relation to the prohibited
possession of firearms as
well as drug trafficking. The judge noted the
observations of this Court to that effect in
By reference to

Orders are issued to
