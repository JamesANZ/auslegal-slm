Expanding the limits
Alice de Jonge
This is a summary from a paper published in
The International Financial Review
, Volume 9.
Efforts to create an international system for corporate responsibility should now be concentrated not on the drafting of yet more
rules and standards, but on the strengthening of existing international institutions.
Alice de Jonge’s paper (of which this is a brief summary) first outlines the problems with using standards that are generally
not enforceable within national courts to make global corporations accountable. It is argued that at least some of these obstacles
could be overcome by strengthening already existing international institutions. Four such institutional structures are examined:
the existing regional human rights bodies; the International Criminal Court (ICC); International Labor Organisation (ILO) institutions
and an expanded International Court of Justice (ICJ).
It is increasingly apparent that there is a need for greater clarity at the international level on the extent to which transnational
corporations (TNCs) should be held responsible for protecting, respecting and promoting human rights.
If corporate responsibility is to be given meaning, then a common framework that identifies the rights relevant to business and the
limits of a company’s responsibility to implement them is required. In this essay, Dr de Jonge argues that by building on and
strengthening existing institutions of international law jurisprudence, mechanisms for defining and clarifying the boundaries of
international law when applied to TNCs can also be created.
Some proposals, such as expanding the work of international human rights tribunals to include scrutinising the activities of TNCs,
may be somewhat idealistic in the face of political and resource constraints, but that does not mean they should not be tried.
What might be more immediately feasible is to expand the jurisdiction of the ICC in cases of grievous abuses of human rights to cover
not just natural persons, but legal (corporate) persons as well.
Similarly hopeful are proposals for strengthening the supervisory powers of the ILO, and for continuing the gradual reform of ICJ
procedural rules to allow increased access to the court by civil society organisations.
