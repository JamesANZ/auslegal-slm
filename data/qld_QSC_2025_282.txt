[1] On 3 October
2025, I published reasons in these three proceedings. On that day, directions
were made for the parties to confer
and attempt to agree upon forms of orders
consistent with the published reasons.
October 2025, pursuant to those directions, the parties informed the Court that
they had agreed on the forms of orders that
should be made, subject to the Court
exercising its discretion, and provided a draft in each proceeding. The
Attorney, as an intervenor,
also considered the draft orders. The Attorney does
not consider there is anything in the draft orders that she wishes to address.
[3] The draft
orders include the judgment sums and interest. In each case, the interest has
been calculated up to and including 29
October 2025. As the calculation of
interest has been agreed, it is appropriate for the Court to make orders for
interest in the
agreed amounts.
[4] Each of the
draft orders provides for the corporation known as the Presbyterian Church of
Queensland (the
Corporation
) to pay the costs of the relevant Catalyst
party (or parties) on the indemnity basis. Each relevant Catalyst party has a
contractual
right to indemnity costs. In exercising the discretion to order
costs, the Court considers whether it should be exercised in a way
from the contractual agreement made by the relevant
The Corporation does not
object to an order being made in terms of the contractual agreements. Nor does
it consider that there
are any factors which should cause the Court to exercise
the discretion other than according to the contractual rights of the Catalyst
parties to be awarded indemnity costs.
circumstances, I have made orders providing for the Catalyst parties to recover
their costs of the proceedings on the indemnity
[6] No order is
sought in respect of the intervention of the Attorney-General.
[7] The Catalyst
parties have advised the Court that the submission of agreed draft orders was
not intended to prejudice any right
they may have to bring an application
for non-party costs orders against the receivers of the Corporation in
respect of the proceedings.
That position is noted.
[8] Finally, I
am grateful to the parties for having identified some typographical and other
minor errors in the published reasons.
Those corrections have been made. A
revised version of the reasons has been
