REASONS FOR DECISION
APPLICATION
Gardens Lifestyle Village at “...”, Empire Bay comprises some 68
sites with 46 longterm sites and 23 sites with
dwellings owned and rented out by
the respondent. The applicants contend that when the park was sold to the
present owner the rent
was $65.00 per week. It is claimed that since that time
the park owners have sought to increase the rent by a further $65.00 per
since 2006. The applicants submit that the presently proposed increase is
of increase was served on the applicants on or about 1
September 2013 proposing an increase of $10.00 per week to a total rent of
$130.00 per week. The park owner claims that the present
applicants are the
only residents to object to the proposed increase.
application was filed on 24
September 2013 and there is no impediment
to the application being dealt with.
MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER
is appropriate to deal with each of the matters required for consideration under
of the Act.
- General Market level of rents for comparable
The applicant contends that the range of rents paid in the park make it
impossible to compare his site with other sites. He refers
to some sites which
have been consolidated to make larger Lots and he also notes that some sites
contain properties owned by the
respondent and rented out as furnished
dwellings. It is suggested that Ettalong Beach Village is a park of higher
quality which
includes a community room and swimming pool and which is situated
within a few minutes walk from the Ettalong Township. The applicants
that the Ettalong Village Park rents had gone up to $121.30 per week following a
rise which was less than the CPI. The
respondents contend that Ettalong Beach
Park is the most comparable park site and reference is made to a decision of
Member Charles
in a matter involving Douglas Hull and Barnes Property
Investments Pty Limited which was heard on the 22 February 2013. In
case Member Charles observed that Ettalong Beach Holiday Village was a park
which to some extent matched the standard and facilities
of the Bayside Gardens
Lifestyle Village, although he noted that in the Ettalong Beach Park residents
were required to pay separately
for water whilst the water charges had been
included in Mr Hull’s rent.
There was very little evidence provided to the tribunal concerning the
respective facilities of the two parks but I am satisfied
that, for the purposes
of comparison, the Ettalong Beach Holiday Village appears to be comparable in
many respects.
The respondents have dealt with the rents paid by other residents in the
Bayside Gardens Village and have noted that Mr Douglas Hull
is presently paying
the lowest rent of any other resident. It has been pointed out that rentals
range from $120.00 per week up to
$160.00 per week but that all residents who
have the benefit of water provided at no extra cost are presently paying $130.00
week or higher. Appendix 1 to the respondent’s material points out
that six residents are paying $122.00 per week and four
are paying $127.00 per
week at the present time. It is to be noted that the rent for these sites is
due to increase in May of 2014
and that each of these residents are paying
additional costs per week for water which Mr Reburger, on behalf of the
applicants, suggests
would amount to at least $3.30 per week.
- value of residential premises
No evidence has been provided by either party in relation to this aspect and
accordingly no issue arises for consideration.
- frequency and amount of past rent increases
The respondent has provided a schedule of the rental increases since 2007.
These increases have been agreed between the parties
and it is noted that there
were no increases for 5 or 6 years prior to 2007. Since the present respondent
took over as park owner
in January 2007 there have been seven increases taking
the general rent from $65.00 per week to a proposed $130.00 per week. The
respondent points out that no other resident of Bayside Gardens Lifestyle
Village, other than the present respondents, has ever taken
the current
managers/owners to the Tribunal on any previous rental increase in recent
– a general price index
Both the applicants and the respondent appear to agree that the relevant CPI
figure taking into account the June and September quarters
is 2.6%. On the
current site rental of $120.00 per week an increase of $3.12 would be
appropriate and would reflect the minimum
increase for the purpose of
– the conduct parties
There is no evidence from either party to support any submission relevant to
– the amount of any outgoings required to be borne by the park
The park owner provided a letter from its accountants suggesting that costs
of services had increased by 16%. Various documents
were attached to the
respondent’s submissions indicating the extent of increases in the cost of
water, electricity, rates and
rubbish removal costs. Mr Reburger, on behalf of
the applicants, extracted the increases in costs and submitted ultimately that
when all of these increases were taken into account they would represent a total
increase in rental of approximately $4.30 per week.
This calculation was made
based upon an assumption that the increase in costs should be distributed over a
total of 66 Units. It
is noted that there was one site containing a
demonstration unit and two sites were presently vacant.
A park owner can present evidence of an increase in costs of particular
outgoings in operating the park, however the Tribunal has
consistently said that
the weight which can be given to the impact of cost increases in outgoings
depends to a large extent on how
much detail is provided. An increase in a
particular outgoing cannot be evidence of the extent to which all outgoings have
increased. It is often the case that a park owner will seek to support an
increase in rent greater than the CPI by reference to
the increased expenses in
operating the park. The weight that should be given to such a claim will depend
on an extent to which
the outgoings produced enable such a claim to be
substantiated.
– the estimated cost of services provided by the park owner or
Consideration of these matters arises under
Section 57(g)
but it is relevant
to note that the provision of water and an additional block with further shower
and toilet facilities on this
site may be relevant to this paragraph and the
following paragraph. It is noted that the present applicants are one of only 15
having the benefit of a quad facility with an extra toilet and shower
which is maintained by the park owners. In the present instance
toilet and shower is of little benefit because the applicants also have their
own toilet and shower within their accommodation
unit. It is noted further that
the applicants represent one site of approximately 30 in total which have the
benefit of water provided
and included in the site rent. Mr Reburger has
conceded that the value of this water would represent at least $3.50 per week
there is no evidence relating to specific usage from either party.
– the value and nature of any fittings, appliances or other goods or
services or facilities provided with the residential
Apart from the provision of water which has been referred to above, it is
not suggested that other services or facilities should
be taken into
– the accommodation and amenities provided in the residential
premises and the state of repair and general condition of the
Neither party has sought to address this issue as relevant to the claim.
– other matters
Although the applicants suggested that some of the facilities that have been
upgraded had been referred to in a previous application,
it was conceded
ultimately there were no other matters relevant to this subsection which should
be included.
these matters the relevant consideration is not the rent itself but the increase
in rent. The Tribunal must determine, after taking
into consideration, the
factors set out in
, whether the increase is excessive. (see
Burrell Seales Ors v Kincumber Nautical Village Pty Limited CTTT NSW 07/300
respondent has submitted that the best guide in the present case is the rents
charged and accepted by the residents of other sites
in the present village. It
is pointed out that the owners of adjoining sites have presently agreed to pay
$130.00 and $132.00 per
week respectively. The applicant points out that he has
always been the resident generally paying the lowest rent and he suggests
this arises because he has regularly challenged the increases whilst others have
decided not to do so.
dealing with the proposed rent increase it is appropriate to have regard to the
rent accepted by other residents and also to the
comparison with the rents
payable at the Ettalong Beach Holiday Village. It is noted that the only rents
which are presently less
than $130.00 per week are rents which can be reviewed
at any time but which would in any event probably be reviewed by May of 2014.
It is noted that the occupants of those sites are also paying water charges in
addition to the rents.
all the circumstances I am satisfied that the rent in respect of Site 48 should
be increased by at least $8.00 per week to a sum
of $128.00. I presently have
difficulty in justifying the increase to $130.00 per week simply because it
gives rise to parity with
some other sites. The increase is to apply for a
period of 12 months from 14 November 2013.
rent overpaid by the applicants is to be credited to their rent account
immediately and any short pay of the rent which has been
ordered is to be made
up by the applicants by 31
January 2014.
