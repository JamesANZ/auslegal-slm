INTRODUCTION
[1] The applicant and respondent were involved in litigation in
the Supreme Court under the
Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act
(Qld) (BIF Act).
[2] In those proceedings, the respondent here (as
applicant) was unsuccessful resulting in an order for costs in favour of the
against the respondent.
[3] The applicant contends that the
parties agreed (a compromise) for the payment of costs by the respondent to the
applicant fixed
in the sum of $30,000.
[4] The application before the court
is in effect the applicant seeking to enforce the compromise by applying for
judgement for the
amount of the alleged agreed sum.
RELEVANT BACKGROUND
[5] The applicant ATG Project & Property Solutions Pty Ltd (ATG)
and the respondent Bright Days Herston Pty Ltd (Bright Days)
were parties to a
contract under which ATG undertook to perform construction work as part of the
development of a childcare centre
located at Herston Road, Brisbane.
decision in which the costs order was made (sought to be recovered in this
proceeding) was a decision of Brown J (as Her Honour
then was) in Bright Days
Herston Pty Ltd v ATG Project & Property Solutions Pty
delivered on 9 May 2024.
proceeding involved an application seeking an injunction against an adjudicator
from making a decision in respect of an adjudication
application pursuant to the
BIF Act involving the parties.
[8] Her Honour set out in her reasons the
relevant background facts,
which relevant for
the present application were:
- ATG and Bright Days were parties to a
contract for construction work.
- ATG sought an adjudication under the BIF
- An adjudicator was appointed and adjudicated the first adjudication
application – in favour of ATG.
- ATG lodged a further application
– the second adjudication application.
- Bright Days objected to the
adjudicator and contended apprehended bias.
- The adjudicator refused the
application to recuse himself.
- Bright Days sought the injunction
restraining the adjudicator.
[9] Bright Days’ application was
ultimately unsuccessful and on 17 May 2024 Brown J made orders that:
application is dismissed.
2) The applicant (Bright Days) pay the first
respondent (ATG) costs of the application.
[10] Subsequently the
parties’ lawyers corresponded in relation to the costs order which
resulted in an agreement (the compromise)
by which the parties agreed that:
- Bright Days pay ATG’s costs, as ordered by Brown J on 17 May 2024,
in the sum of $30,000 within 30 days.
APPLICANT’S APPLICATION
[11] The applicant has commenced by
originating application.
[12] The applicant seeks orders that:
respondent pay the applicant the sum of $30,000 pursuant to the agreement.
2) In the alternative to (1) the respondent pay the applicant the sum of
$30,000 as damages for breach of the agreement.
3) The respondent pay the
applicant interest on the sum of $30,000 pursuant to
Proceedings Act 2011
4) The respondent pay the applicant’s
costs of the application on an indemnity basis.
THE PARTIES’ MATERIAL
[13] The applicant has filed and relies upon:
- Originating application
filed 21 February 2025
- Affidavit of William Munroe filed 21 February
- Affidavit of Thomas McKillup filed 21 February 2025
- Affidavit of
Edward Shephard filed by leave 7 April 2025
[14] The respondent has filed and
relies upon:
- Affidavit of Davin Johnson filed by leave 7 April 2025
[15] Both the applicant’s counsel and the respondent’s solicitor
provided an outline of argument.
[16] Unfortunately, those outlines do not
address the principal issue for determination in this application relating to
the respondent’s
contention that it has a ‘set-off’ in respect
of the claim giving rise to disputed facts such that the applicant cannot
commence by originating application.
THE RELEVANT RULE
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld) (UCPR) provides as follows:
1) The court may, at any stage of a proceeding, on the application of a
party, make any order, including a judgement, that the nature
of the case
2) The court may make the order even if there is no claim for
relief extending to the order in the originating process, statement
counterclaim, or similar document.
[18] Counsel for the applicant and
solicitor for the respondent did not address either in their written outlines of
argument or their
oral submissions the power of the court to give judgement
pursuant to r 358 (UCPR) nor the discretion to grant that relief and what
informed the exercise of that discretion.
[19] There appears an acceptance
by the respondent that r 658 is the appropriate vehicle for the applicant to
seek a money judgement.
[20] The Supreme Court considered r 658 in Warwick v
in similar circumstances where the
applicant sought to enforce the balance of an unsatisfied compromise. There, the
proceedings were
commenced by originating application and sought an injunction,
but Chesterman J having concluded the settlement agreement remained
found that r 658 ‘appears to confer ample power on the court to give
appropriate judgement notwithstanding the form
proceedings.’
[21] The same
conclusion in respect of the power conferred by r 658 was reached by His Honour
Judge Morzone KC DCJ in Pezzelato v
[22] There the parties had following a
mediation resolved the claim that required the defendant to pay a settlement sum
to the plaintiff
by instalments. The compromise was reduced to writing. The
defendant defaulted on the terms of the compromise and the plaintiff brought
application in the substantive proceedings pursuant to r 658 seeking judgement.
[23] The circumstances of that case are similar to the present proceedings
insofar as the relief sought on the application by the
plaintiff is concerned.
[24] His Honour concluded that either pursuant to r 658 or r 190(1) the
plaintiff had an entitlement to judgement for the whole of
the balance of the
settlement sum outstanding under the
[25] I am satisfied that r 658
provides a broad power to give judgement for a plaintiff, in circumstances such
as the present where
it is alleged that an action has been compromised and the
settlement sum has not been paid.
THE ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION
applicant’s material proves that:
- An order that the Bright Days pay
ATG’s costs was made on 17 May 2024
- The parties agreed that Bright
Days pay ATG’s costs, pursuant to the costs order made 17 May 2024, fixed
in the sum of $30,000
within 30 days.
respondent appears to accept that and takes no issue with it.
[27] Consistent with the decision in Pezzelato v AGPN Pty Ltd the applicant
would appear prima facie entitled to judgement pursuant
to r 658 (UCPR) for the
agreed settlement sum of $30,000.
[28] The respondent, however, contends
that it has a set-off against the claim resulting in no amount owing.
[29] The respondent further contends that on that basis there is a matter of
disputed fact and effectively:
- The respondent has a defence to the claim.
- The proceeding cannot be commenced by an originating application.
PROCEEDING COMMENCED BY ORIGINATING APPLICATION
[30] The applicant has
commenced by way of originating application.
UCPR provides:
11 Application Permitted
A proceeding may be started by application if
(a) The only or main issue in the proceeding is an issue of law and a
substantial dispute is unlikely...
[32] The authorities considering the entitlement to commence proceedings by way
of originating application have primarily involved
claims under the
Building and
Construction Industry Payments Act 2004
[33] In National Vegetation
Management Solutions Pty Ltd v Shekar Plant Hire Pty
M Wilson J noting that the proceedings
were commenced by originating application observed
no point was taken about
the commencement of the proceeding by originating application. In the
circumstances my determination of the
substantive issues raised on the
application should not be taken as approval or disapproval of the form of
originating process used
in this case.
[34] That decision was cited in
Penfold Projects Pty Ltd v Securcorp Ltd,
decision of Irwin DCJ where the respondent argued that the application was
really a ‘dressed up’ application for summary
judgement. The
respondent took issue with the commencement of proceedings by way of originating
application, however, Irwin DCJ concluded
that as he could determine the
substantive issues raised on the application, it was ultimately not necessary to
resolve this question.
[35] Henry J in
O’Brien v Robsyn Pty Ltd
considering an application seeking a declaration as to the ownership of property
found that there was no likely substantial dispute
of facts, and the proceeding
was correctly commenced by originating application.
THE CLAIMED SET-OFF
[36] Bright Days contend that it can demonstrate that there is an
overpayment by it to ATG and that, that in law, is capable of valid
[37] Bright Days relies on the affidavit of Mr Johnson who deposes to:
- An adjudication decision was issued on 22 January 2024 in the amount of
$1,004,306.52.
- The parties agreed and reduced the adjudication certificate
to $459,726.85.
- Bright Days was seeking to set aside that decision in the
Supreme Court and alternatively, pursue litigation rights to recover money
claimed by ATG pursuant to the erroneous adjudication decision.
paragraphs where he simply inserts tables of calculations, he asserts that there
has been an overpayment by Bright Days
$2,335,715.05.
[38] The applicant
contends that the evidence of Mr Johnson is at its highest opinion evidence. Mr
Johnson does not annex any material
to support the calculations which he simply
tabulates in paragraphs 16 – 18. His bare assertion at paragraph 19 that
to Bright Days the amount of $2,335,715.05 is just that, a bare
assertion. I do not find the evidence of Mr Johnson persuasive or
[39] Bright Days contend that what is expressed to be a claim for
restitution, the alleged overpayment, is a liquidated demand and
is capable of
constituting a set-off.
[40] That proposition is challenged by ATG who rely
on the decision of Forsyth v
[41] ATG contend that there is no
causal connection between whatever the subject matter of the proposed
substantive proceedings by
Bright Days may be and the agreement as between ATG
and Bright Days on the compromise of the costs payable pursuant to the costs
order. Keane JA (as His Honour then was) in Forsyth v Gibbs found that the
learned primary judge erred in concluding that an alleged
claim for negligence
constituted a set-off claim justifying the dismissal of an application for
summary judgement.
[42] The Court of Appeal found in that matter that the
absence of sufficient connection was manifest between the claim and the proposed
claim for negligence, concluding
The respondent’s claim against
Forsyth Pty Ltd and the male appellant arise quite separately from the
appellant’s claim
to repayment of their loan to the respondent. Those
claims cannot be relied upon to establish an equitable set-off against the loan
debt. No further investigation of the facts is necessary to establish that that
[43] Keane JA continued
It is important to emphasise that the
availability of an equitable set-off between cross-claims does not depend on
unfettered discretionary
assessment of whether it would be unfair in a general
sense for a plaintiff to insist on payment of the debt owed to it while the
cross-claim remains unpaid. It is essential that there be such a connection
between the claim and the cross-claim that the cross-claim
can be said to
impeach the claim so as to make it unfair for the claim to be allowed without
taking into account of the cross-claim.
[44] Further
In the present case
even if the claims which the respondent seeks to set off were ultimately made
out against Forsyth Pty Ltd and
the male appellant, the liabilities such
established could not in any way be said to impeach the appellant’s claim
to be repaid
the debt for the monies they lent to the respondent.
if Bright Days had a proper evidentiary foundation for contending that there had
been an overpayment giving rise to a claim,
which I find not proven on the
respondent’s material, following the Court of Appeal decision in Forsyth v
Gibbs I conclude
that there is not such a connection between the claim and the
cross-claim such that it can be found that the cross-claim can impeach
and therefore does not give rise to a set-off.
DISPOSITION
applicant, on undisputed facts, has made out that the respondent has defaulted
on the terms of the agreement as to payment
[47] The respondent is
not entitled to any set-off in respect of this claim.
[48] The applicant has
an entitlement to judgement for the whole of the settlement sum of $30,000.
