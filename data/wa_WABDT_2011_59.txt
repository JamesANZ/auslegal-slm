REASONS FOR DECISION
Reasons for Decision are in respect of Order to Pay No.1/2011-12 issued by the
Building Disputes Tribunal on 1 July 2011 following
a hearing on 27 June 2011
(“the Hearing”).They should be read with Reasons for Decision
O.18032/2 published on 7 February
2011, which provides relevant background to
this complaint.
current complaint was lodged by Aquatic Leisure Technologies trading as
Buccaneer Pools and Spas (the Builder) on 6 December 2010
against Mass and Julie
Fabbri (the Owners). The claim is for the final payment ($3435) due under a
contract for installation of a
fibreglass swimming pool by the Builder for the
Owners at 3 Royal James Court, Quinns Rocks.
The Hearing
Building Disputes Tribunal heard evidence at the hearing from both of the Owners
and Ms Calpak (Collections Officer) for the Builder.
parties agree that they entered into a contract for installation of a swimming
pool on 24 November 2007. The Owners contracted
to pay the Builder the sum of
$22,935 but only paid $19,500.
Builder submitted that the Owners did not permit it to complete the contract due
to various workmanship complaints.
Building Disputes Tribunal determined the Owners’ complaint 18032/2 after
a hearing on 28 May 2010 by ordering the Builder
to pay the Owners the sum of
$11,700 pursuant to section 12A(1)(b) of the
Registration Act
. This was the sum required to rectify the workmanship
defects and bring the contractual works to completion.
Builder paid this amount as ordered and now seeks from the Owners the final
payment due under the contract, being the sum of $3,435.00.
Builder submitted that the Owners have now received the full benefit of the
contractual works. The Owners will have received an
unjust enrichment if they do
not pay the Builder the balance of the contractual sum.
Owners deny that they are liable to pay the balance of the contract price, as
the Builder did not complete the contract.
Owners testified that they suffered a long period of stress and inconvenience
due to the Builder’s failure to complete the
contractual works within a
reasonable time. I interpret this as a counterclaim that the Builder has
breached the contract.
Owners testified that they have not had the pool finished by an alternative pool
business, although they received the full amount
of the Order to Pay from the
Builder, because they believe this amount is inadequate and are concerned about
warranties for the remedial
works. The pool pump has been unused for an extended
period of time and the Building Disputes Tribunal did not order the Builder
pay for a new one as requested by the Owners in complaint 18032/2. For these
reasons, the Owners consider it unfair that they
should pay the balance due
under the contract.
Owners did not produce any evidence at this hearing that the pump does not work
or that the Builder is the cause of any malfunction.
Builder produced correspondence between the parties to show that an offer to
accept $1,855.00 in full settlement of the final
invoice was made by the Builder
to the Owners (Exhibit 1). This was not accepted by the Owners and the offer
was withdrawn (Exhibit
2). Various offers and counteroffers made during the
hearing did not result in an agreement.
Building Disputes Tribunalhas previously heard and determined the arguments
raised by the Owners concerning the absence of pool
headers, viability of the
pump and the cost of rectifications. I consider this a misconceived attempt to
re-litigate complaint 18032/2.The
Building Disputes Tribunalhas no jurisdiction
to make any further determination on those issues.
am satisfied that the Owners have effectively received the benefit of the
completed contractual works and are therefore legally
required to perform their
contractual obligations by making full payment to the Builder. The outstanding
contract sum is $3,435.00.
I deduct the amount of $500.00, which the parties
agreed is the value of a promotional outdoor setting that was not supplied by
further deduct the sum of $1,000.00 to take into account the protracted period
of stress and inconvenience suffered by the Owners
as a result of the
Builder’s failure to perform its contractual obligations within a
reasonable time. The Builder itself referred
in its letter of 9 December 2008 to
the “awful experience” endured by the Owners. The Builder did not
effectively perform
its contractual obligations until payment of the Order to
Pay dated 8 November 2010.
find the complaint proved under
to the extent that the Owners must pay the Builder the sum
$1,935.00 due under the contract within 28 days.
Respondent Owners are ordered to pay the Complainant Builder the sum of
$1,935.00 pursuant to
within 28 days of the date hereunder.
complaint is thereafter
