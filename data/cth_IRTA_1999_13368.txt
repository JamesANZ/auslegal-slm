DATE: 27 January 1999
PLACE: Sydney
DECISION: The Tribunal remits this application to the Department with the
direction that except for the health, character and English
proficiency
requirements which the Tribunal has not assessed, Lydio Balares meets all other
criteria for a Class 816 visa.
INTRODUCTION
This is a review of a decision refusing the grant of a Class 816 (special
(permanent)) entry permit to Lydio Balares and to his wife,
Marina Balares and
son, Sydney Balares. The primary application was lodged in Sydney on 31 May
1994 and a decision refusing the
application was made by the delegate of the
Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (the Department) on 8 September
officer of the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) affirmed the
decision on 29 April 1996. The application for review was made
to the Tribunal
on 20 May 1996.
Lydio Balares was born in the Philippines on 11 February 1955 and is a citizen
of that country. He entered Australia on 17 April
1991 using a visitor visa
issued to him in Manila on 28 February 1991. He lodged an application for
recognition of refugee status
which is recorded as received by the Department
on 10 December 1991.
Marina Balares was born on 18 July 1959 in the Philippines and is a citizen of
that country. Sydney Balares was born on 30 June
1992 in Australia.
LEGISLATION
As a result of the coming into force of the
Migration Reform Act 1992
1 September 1994 Australian migration law has undergone significant
changes. In accordance with
regulation 23
Migration Reform
(Transitional Provisions) Regulations
, the application in this case is taken to
be an application for a transitional (permanent) visa under the new law. For
most purposes
this will resemble the entry permit that would have been granted
under the law in force before 1 September 1994. However the application
is still to be decided according to the criteria that applied to the entry
permit for which application was originally made. The
Regulations which are
applicable in this case are therefore the Migration (1993) Regulations.
The prescribed criteria that must be satisfied before a Class 816 or 818 visa
can be granted are set out in Part 816 and 818 of Schedule
2 of the 1993
Regulations. These are set out in full at the end of this decision. An
applicant is entitled to one of these visas
only if he or she satisfies each of
the various prescribed criteria, some of which must be satisfied at the time of
application and
others at the time of decision. Failure to satisfy any one of
the criteria results in a failure of the application. The relevant
criteria in
respect of the grant of the Class 816 and Class 818 visa are summarised briefly
The criteria which must be satisfied before a
visa is granted
At the time of application:
* Visa Applicant must be under 45 years of age (816.721(1)(a)(i));
* Educational qualifications/Work experience (816.721(2)) or business interest
(816.721(3)) held on 1 November 1993;
* Refugee Application or class 435 or 443 entry permit lodged on or before
1 November 1993 (816.721(4) or (6));
* Visa Applicant must be in Australia (816.722);
* Date of grant of visa must be prior to 12 March 1992 and arrival in Australia
must be prior to 1 November 1993 (816.724) (subject
to certain exceptions).
At the time of decision:
* Visa Applicant must show an ability to communicate in English (816.732);
* Public interest criteria (816.734).
And the relevant criteria for a
visa are as follows:
At the time of application:
* Visa Applicant must be under 45 years of age (818.721(1)(a));
* Educational qualifications (818.721(2), (3), (4) or (5));
* Visa Applicant must not have received financial assistance from the
government to undertake study (818.722);
* Date of grant of visa must be prior to 12 March 1992 and arrival in Australia
must be prior to 1 November 1993 (818.723) (subject
to certain exceptions;
* Visa Applicant must be in Australia (818.724).
At the time of decision:
* Public interest criteria (818.732).
EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS
The Tribunal had before it Departmental file 91/77370 and Tribunal file
N96/01254. A hearing was held on 13 May 1997 at which Lydio
and Marina Balares
gave evidence. The Visa Applicants were advised by Mark Cruice of Adrian Joel
Trade Qualifications
After the hearing, the trade skills of Marina Balares in relation to the trade
of dress making were assessed by the Victorian State
Training Board (now Vet
Assess) with the result that Mrs Balares was found not to have the necessary
trade skills.
A letter, dated 8 September 1998, from the Skills Assessment Unit of Trades
Recognition Australia (TRA) in the Federal Department
of Workplace Relations
and Small Business states that assessment of Lydio Balares' trade training and
experience in the trade of
first class welding (Engineering) has been completed
and he is deemed to have had the equivalent of Australian standards of training
and experience in that trade. The letter states further that the date on which
he is deemed to have achieved that standard is 17
August 1998.
The Tribunal is satisfied that Trade Recognition Australia in the Federal
Department of Industrial Relations is the appropriate authority
assessment for the trade of welding.
In relation to the date at which Lydio Balares could be said to have met
Australian training standards in the welding trade, the
Tribunal notes that the
date referred to in the letter of 8 September 1998 from TRA was, according to a
telephone conversation between
the Manager of the Skills Assessment Unit of TRA
and an officer of the Tribunal, based on the fact that Lydio Balares had on
date passed a trade test whereas in 1994 the Unit had interviewed him,
apparently without an interpreter, and come to the conclusion
he did not have
technical training. They had, therefore, not proceeded to administer the trade
test to him at that time. The Tribunal
also notes that the documents attached
to the visa application form lodged on 31 May 1994 include a resume of Mr
Balares' trade training
and work experience as well as certified copies and
translation of certificates relating to work performed by him as a welder and
fitter in the Philippines and Saudi Arabia between 1980 and 1990 and training
as a welder in the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. Moreover,
according to that
resume, the information shown on the visa application form itself and in a
letter, dated 14 December 1998, from
Mr Balares adviser, the Visa
Applicant has not worked in the welding field since coming to Australia. The
adviser's letter indicates
that although Mr Balares enrolled in two welding
courses at Parramatta Regional College in July 1993 and July 1994 these were
of short duration and at a low level. The letter goes on to summarise Mr
Balares' training and experience in the welding field as
i) MDICA (Welding Method; Welding Hand; E-Hand), September 9, 1980 - October
ii) Welders Examination (Practical and Theory, Welding German Standard; Saudi
Arabia) November 5, 1980; and
iii) Diversified Technical Consultant Trade Test as a Structural Welder -
CAASSB, Saudi Arabia, March 14, 1990.
In terms of work experience, Mr Balares has provided me with a Certificate of
Appreciation conferred by the Construction and Building
Establishment for Trade
and Industry located in Saudi Arabia verifying employment as a Welder and
Fitter from May 26, 1980 until
September 1, 1985.
On the basis of its consideration of Mr Balares' training and experience in the
trade of welding, the Tribunal is satisfied that
the skills he demonstrated
when trade tested in 1998 were, in all probability, due to his work experience
and training in the welding
trade prior to coming to Australia. Therefore, the
Tribunal is satisfied that Lydio Balares can be said to have satisfied the
requirements
of subclause 816.721(2) as at 1 November 1993.
English Proficiency
Lydio Balares has failed tests of proficiency in English which he sat in 1994
and 1995. The results of the second of these tests
however, must now be
reconsidered in light of the Federal Court's decision in the case of
Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
(1997) 147 ALR 673
in which it was found that only the tests which took place in November 1994
met the criteria in 816.732(3) which refer to a test of
English proficiency
"nominated by the Minister" and also require "a time and place nominated by the
Minister" for such tests. On
this basis, Lydio Balares cannot be said to have
had the opportunity to demonstrate whether he could meet the criteria in
or (4). Nor is there other evidence available to allow the Tribunal
to assess Mr Balares' English proficiency in any of the ways
required by clause
For these reasons, being unable to make an assessment of Lydio Balares' ability
to communicate in English by reference to evidence
of the kind set out in
subclause (2) or (3) of clause 816.732, the Tribunal determines to remit the
assessment of this requirement
to the Department.
Other Criteria
The Tribunal finds that Lydio Balares was granted his visa to travel to
Australia from overseas before 12 March 1992 and entered
Australia using that
visa before 1 November 1993.
The Tribunal finds that Lydio Balares was in Australia at the date of his
816/818 entry permit application and was in Australia on
1 November 1993.
The Tribunal finds that as at 1 November 1993 Lydio Balares was under 45 years
of age and had already applied for refugee status,
that application having been
recorded by the Department on 10 December 1991.
For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Lydio Balares meets all the criteria
for an 816 visa with the exception of health, character
and English proficiency
requirements which it has not assessed.
The Tribunal remits this application to the Department with the direction that
except for the health, character and English proficiency
requirements which the
Tribunal has not assessed, Lydio Balares meets all other criteria for a Class
I certify that this and the 6 preceding pages are a true copy of the decision
and reasons for decision of this Tribunal.
