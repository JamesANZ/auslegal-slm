LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES
FOR APPLICANT:
instructed by Steve Masselos
FOR RESPONDENT:
MR M INGLIS instructed by
Leigh Virtue & Hicksons Lawyers
1. Brian McCrowe seeks weekly benefits from 17 September 2001 to date and
continuing, and lump sum compensation for neck impairment,
loss of use of his
upper and lower limbs, together with payment of medical expenses.
2. His claim is based on an injury which he alleged he sustained on 15
January 1995. It was a minor incident and on the evidence
he gave before me, it
did not seem to result in any permanent injury. Within a few days, he was back
at work and the neck symptoms
had resolved. However, also bases his claim on
the nature and conditions of employment as a welder from June 1994 until
2001, though he was involved in heavy welding work for the respondent
from as earlier as October 1986 and, before that time had worked
as a welder for
two years with Guild Matthews, as well as working for a time checking trains for
the railway, and as self employed
in leather work and jewellery with his wife
and attending various shows.
3. Since the issue is mainly a medical one, it depends very much on the
support provided by the medical experts.
4. Exhibit A contains a report from Dr Martin Jude which is dated 13 March
2003. Dr Jude is a neurologist and consultant physician
who initially reviewed
McCrowe in July 2001. When he viewed an MRI scan exposed in July 2001, he
reported that:
It showed evidence of severe spinal cord compression adjacent to the C4/5
level, and to a lesser extent, at one vertebral level higher
with signal
alteration in the cervical cord consistent with myelomalacia.
5. He noted that:
The compressive abnormalities were related to
degenerative joint disease in the cervical spine, with alteration in bone marrow
intensity in four vertebral bodies
which, he said, was again
consistent with degenerative joint disease
. It was on the basis of this
MRI scan that the applicant was referred to Dr Timothy Steel, a neurosurgeon,
who performed surgery
at the cervical spine level on 17 September 2001. Dr
Jude, in summary observed that McCrowe:
Initially presented with symptoms of
hand paraesthesia
The clinical suspicion was that this was related to carpal tunnel
syndrome, and although this diagnosis would technically found to
be present in
the right hand, his clinical syndrome was more in keeping with cervical spinal
cord compression which was confirmed
by imaging and with changes consistent with
degenerative joint disease.
6. Dr Jude observed that the nature of McCrowe's problem was one of
degenerative disease, and that the nature of his work as a welder
and in lifting
heavy objects would certainly be likely to have accelerated degenerative joint
disease. However, Dr Jude did not
believe that the work had directly caused the
condition and that he would have undergone the surgery in any event. He said
The underlying carpal tunnel syndrome would be consistent with his
normal work duties, but the changes allegedly were marginal
, so that Dr Jude
did not believe the carpal tunnel played any significant part in his functional
incapacity. In any event, the more
recent nerve conduction studies showed some
amelioration or improvement in this syndrome, so that the changes were marginal
right hand, normal in the left.
7. The doctor observed (and this was my conclusion independent of this
report) that
the accident which took place in November 1995 had no direct
causative effect on any of the symptoms which the applicant now complains
8. Exhibit 1 contains a series of reports of a number of doctors. Dr Robert
Smith first examined the applicant in July 2001. He
thought that:
Historically, everything was rather indefinite concerning the alleged
carpal tunnel syndrome, because those symptoms according to
McCrowe had 'just
came on'. He also gave a history of low back problems and some unsteadiness
with his gait.
9. Dr Smith gained the impression in July 2001 that McCrowe's condition was
not due to any definite work-related incident. In an
additional report dated
January 2003, having examined a number of investigative reports, and
particularly the MRI scan, and having
read the report of Dr Jude of August 2001,
Dr Robert Smith concluded that he was quite certain McCrowe's symptoms were all
intrinsic neck changes. He thought that the parties could be quite sure
that the symptoms had nothing to do primarily with his work
as a welder, and
noted that it should be remembered that he had been told that the symptoms had
just came on.
10. These conclusions of Dr Robert Smith are mirrored in the conclusions of
Dr Perrett whose initial report is dated August 2002 and
whose follow up report
is dated January 2003. In his final report, Dr Perrett noted that he read the
records of Dr Zammit and Mr
Roberts', the chiropractor, all of which confirmed
his own opinion, expressed in his earlier report of August 2002, namely that
neck problems
arose from constitutional condition of cervical
spondylosis which had progressively worsened.
11. In his final report of January 2003, Dr Lloyd Hughes observed that all
the documentation which he had been given to read, including
the reports of the
chiropractor and Dr Zammit, confirmed his opinion that the problem was
degenerative disc disease in the cervical and lumbar spine which had been in
existence since at least 1992,
and further confirmed that the incident
pleaded in November 1995 was
completely irrelevant.
12. Dr Harvey prepared a report dated January 2003 and diagnosed, as the
others did,
cervical myelopathy
. He observed that McCrowe had
relatively mild spastic paresis of the right upper limb, but quite a significant
spastic paresis of both lower limbs.
He said the applicant's
in the cervical spine was secondary to advanced degenerative changes in the
cervical spine with spinal stenosis.
13. There seems to be little doubt that almost the entire condition of the
worker is the result of degenerative changes. There does
seem to be some
evidence that he did have carpal tunnel but this seems to have disappeared, or
at least almost disappeared, and is
of no significance.
14. In the light of the medical evidence, and in the light of the applicant's
evidence in chief before me, I have no hesitation in
entering an award for the
respondent. I make no orders as to costs.
Mr M Perry instructed by Steve
Masselos appeared for the applicant.
Mr M Inglis instructed by Leigh Virtue
& Hicksons Lawyers appeared for the respondent.
