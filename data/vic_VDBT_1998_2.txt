CROSS RESPONDENT
REASONS FOR DETERMINATION:
1. This is an application under s107 Domestic Building Contracts and Tribunal
Act 1995 to review a determination of the Tribunal.
Under s107 a determination
may be reviewed if it appears that -
(a) there is a clerical mistake or,
(b) a factual error in the findings in which the determination was based that
may have influenced the outcome of proceedings.
2. A review cannot be conducted unless the application contains sufficient
detail to enable the Tribunal to determine whether or not
the Tribunal has power
to conduct the Review. That determination must be conducted solely on the basis
of the written document constituting
the application and any documents
accompanying it. In addition it is my view implicit that the Tribunal may refer
to such documents
as the determination and other documents on the Tribunal file
which are common to all parties. In this case the application has
been made in
a narrative form making it difficult to properly identify the clerical mistakes
or factual errors which are intended
to be relied upon and more importantly
totally fails to properly identify any material either in the application or in
other documents
falling within the class of documents specified above which
would enable me to be satisfied that the Tribunal may have jurisdiction
entertain a review. The onus of course falls on the Applicant to set out his
grounds in a clear and readily understandable manner.
It is appropriate to
comment that where there is conflicting evidence the fact that a member accepts
one witness rather than another
is not a basis for establishing a clerical
mistake or factual error. There are many instances where there is conflicting
and the fact that a member accepts one witness rather than another does
not establish mistake or error. The opinion expressed by
the member as part of
his or her reasons may well not accord with the opinion of the losing party.
3. After careful review of the document entitled "Description of Grounds of
the Application" I am unable to be satisfied, with one
exception, that the
Tribunal has power to review any of the matters that have been referred to
therein. In the form they are in
they constitute little more than allegations
and fail to provide a sound basis upon which I could be satisfied that the
may have power to grant the application.
4. In para 2 of the description of the grounds there is a reference to
member’s finding no. 1 which is as follows:
"The binding contracts between the parties are both contracts dated
4 April 1997."
The contracts have been exhibited and I have examined them. Mr Tawadros is
not named as a party to any of the contracts. Whether
or not he may be liable
as a respondent on some other basis is not something that at this stage I should
express any view upon.
In relation to that question I am satisfied that the
Tribunal may have power to review it and accordingly I propose to direct that
the Registrar list the review for hearing and notify all parties to the initial
proceeding of the review limited to that question.
