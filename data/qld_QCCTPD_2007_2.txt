REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
1 This is a determination on costs in the matter of the Tribunal’s
decision on a review of the cancellation by the Plumbers
and Drainers Board
("the respondent") of the Plumbers and Drainers Licence of Len Casella ("the
applicant").
2 Upon delivery of its decision in the substantive matter, the Tribunal invited
further written submissions from the parties on the
issue of costs. Upon
receipt of those further submissions I considered them and also the
applicant’s earlier submissions on
costs dated 17 August
Offer to settle
3 The applicant made a number of offers to settle to the respondent prior to the
hearing of the matter in the Tribunal. The final
offer dated 12 July 2007
contained the highest level of concessions by the applicant. It contained an
offer to settle on the basis
that the cancellation of the licence be set aside,
the applicant’s licence be suspended for three months from the date of
decision and that a condition be placed on the licence that the
applicant desist from carrying out backflow prevention work until
completed a backflow prevention course.
4 Section 142(1) of the
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
CCT Act") relevantly provides as follows:
(1) This section
applies if –
a party to a
proceeding serves another party to the proceedings with a written offer to
settle the matters in dispute between the
the other party does not
accept the offer within the time the offer is open;
the offer complies with
this Division; and
opinion of the Tribunal, the decision of the Tribunal on the matters in dispute
is not more favourable to the other party than
(2) The Tribunal must award the party
who made the offer all reasonable costs incurred by that party in conducting the
after the offer was made....
5 The offer to settle made by the applicant represented "
an effective
suspension of approximately four
combined with the
obligation to complete a backflow prevention course. By comparison, the order
of the Tribunal imposed an effective
suspension of six (6) months combined with
conditions creating obligations to provide information on the request of an
and imposing a twelve (12) month review period. In my view, the
conditions imposed by the Tribunal were significantly more onerous
proposed in the offer to settle.
6 In my opinion, the decision of the Tribunal was more favourable to the
respondent than the applicant’s offer. Accordingly,
the requirement in
section 142(2) that the party making an offer to settle must be awarded costs
has no application in this matter.
Submissions
7 The applicant submits that an order for costs should be made against the
respondent. He submits that the applicant acted reasonably
throughout the
proceedings including by seeking to resolve the matter by early compromise. It
is submitted the respondent acted
unlawfully and unreasonably during the
disciplinary process, failed to acknowledge its errors and frustrated the
applicant’s
attempts to achieve an early resolution of the matter.
8 The respondent submits the applicant is not entitled to costs and that its own
claim for costs should be upheld. It submits that
the applicant exhibited an
inappropriate attitude and that his conduct before and during the hearing shows
a person with scant regard
for his legal obligations as a
9 The Tribunal’s jurisdiction in respect to costs is dealt with in Part 5
Division 7 of the CCT Act. Section 70 provides that
the purpose of the Division
is to have "
parties pay their own costs unless the interests of justice
require otherwise
10 It seems to me that the provisions impose a general rule that the parties
should pay their own costs, unless good reason is shown
in terms of the
interests of justice for making an award of costs in the
proceedings.
11 Section 71 implements the purpose by empowering the Tribunal to award costs
it considers appropriate. In deciding whether to
award costs, and the amount of
the costs, the Tribunal may have regard to the following matters listed in
section 71(4):
"(a) The outcome of the proceedings;
The conduct of the
parties to the proceedings before and during the
proceedings;
The nature and
complexity of the
proceedings;
The relative
strengths of the claims made by each of the parties to the
proceedings;
contravention of an Act by a party to the
proceedings;
For a proceeding
to which a State Agency is a party, whether the other party to the proceeding
was afforded natural justice by the
Anything else the
Tribunal considers relevant.
12 Although the applicant was partially successful in that the decision of the
Board to cancel was set aside, nevertheless the Tribunal
found he was involved
in unsatisfactory performance of work and imposed a penalty representing an
effective suspension of six months
and placed conditions on the licence
requiring the retention and provision on request of information, subject to
review after a period
of twelve months.
13 While it is true that this outcome represents an improved result for the
applicant, it is also true that the respondent Board’s
defence of the
matter was successful to the extent that the Tribunal ultimately imposed a
significant penalty.
14 The applicant submits that in considering the respondent’s conduct of
the proceedings regard should be had to the respondent
having acted on an error
of law in having denied procedural fairness to the applicant.
15 The error of law which resulted in the decision being set aside was a belief
that the applicant had been convicted of offences.
In fact, the company of
which Mr Casella was the sole director and shareholder was convicted. Mr
Casella described himself as the
owner of the company’s business. The
distinction, although significant at law, was of a technical nature.
16 The Board did seek further information from the applicant and acted to some
extent on the response it received from the applicant.
To do so without
providing further notice was contrary to the strict statutory scheme. However,
this information did not constitute
the dominant reason for cancellation which
remained the alleged convictions. The applicant was not denied procedural
fairness in
respect to the Board’s deliberation on the dominant reason.
17 The respondent cannot be realistically criticised for failing to compromise
in the circumstance that the offer by the applicant
fell short of the result
ultimately achieved in the Tribunal.
18 Both parties were granted the right to legal representation and the applicant
was legally represented. The respondent Board
was represented by a legally
trained officer. The matter was of sufficient complexity to justify the
utilisation of legal representation.
19 In my view, there are factors which favour the claims of each of the parties.
I consider the applicant was justified in bringing
the matter to hearing. The
Tribunal has found that there was an error in the decision-making process of the
Board and in regard
to one limited aspect, that the applicant was not accorded
procedural fairness. On the other hand, although the decision of the
not confirmed, a decision was substituted which made significant adverse
findings against the applicant and imposed disciplinary
action upon him.
20 Having regard to all the factors relevant to the award of costs, I consider
that the interests of justice will be best served
by an order requiring each
party to pay its own costs.
21 The order of orders of the Tribunal will be as follows:
Each party will pay its own
costs of and incidental to the proceedings.
