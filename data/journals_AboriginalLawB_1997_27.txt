Indigenous Intellectual Property Protection
Consultations with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples
by Michael Davis ATSIC, Canberra, January 1997
In October 1994 the previous government released an Issues Paper called
Stopping the Rip-Offs: Intellectual Property Protection for
Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Peoples. That Paper discussed the effectiveness of the
(Cth) and other intellectual property legislation for the
protection of Indigenous peoples' 'arts and cultural expressions'.
Forty-nine submissions were made to the
Stopping the Rip-Offs
An Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) was established, convened by the
Department of Communications and the Arts, and including
representation from
ATSIC, to evaluate these submissions, and make recommendations to the Government
for further actions. Among the
options being considered is new legislation that
would be more appropriate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
has accepted responsibility for undertaking consultations with Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander peoples to seek their views
input into, possible new legislation.
To carry out consultations, in early 1996 ATSIC established an Indigenous
Reference Group chaired by the ATSIC Commissioner responsible
for Arts and
Culture, and comprising twelve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with
expertise and experience in arts, culture
and heritage. The group will manage
community consultations, provide advice, and report to the ATSIC Board of
Commissioners on the
outcomes of these consultations.
In June 1996 ATSIC established a consultancy, auspiced through the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies
(AIATSIS) to continue
the consultations. A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the
project, with representatives from
ATSIC, the IDC, the AIATSIS and the
Indigenous Reference Group, in addition to the consultants. The consultants,
Terri Janke, with
Michael Frankel and Company, will prepare a discussion paper,
and disseminate this as the basis for consultations with the Indigenous
Reference Group and Indigenous communities. A report will then be submitted to
ATSIC proposing some options and recommendations for
reform. The consultants aim
to have the discussion paper produced by May 1997, with Indigenous
community-based consultations scheduled
through to August, and a final Report to
be completed by October.
Many of the submissions to the Stopping the Rip Offs Issues Paper argued that
does not provide a sufficient basis for protection of
Indigenous peoples' intellectual property, and that new sui generis legislation
is necessary. It is also the view of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people that measures for improved protection of their
'intellectual property'
rights should include consideration of a wider range of cultural products and
expressions than are protected
under existing western intellectual property
laws. The range may, for example, include rights in ecological and
pharmacological knowledge,
biological products and derivatives, secret or sacred
information, and intangible cultural expressions such as song, story, dance,
Some discussions have already commenced in relation to the definitional
aspects of Indigenous intellectual property, and the range
of elements that may
be included. The complexities and sensitivities of these considerations were
highlighted, for example, at a
workshop organised by ATSIC in Canberra, on 5-7
May 1996, with the Indigenous Reference Group, members of the IDC, and visiting
There was discussion at that workshop about the meanings, and
appropriateness to Indigenous peoples, of the term 'folklore' as it
is sometimes
used to label Indigenous intellectual property or cultural heritage. That
discussion demonstrated that it is important
to develop reforms that are based
on a proper understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples'
perspectives, definitions
and categories of cultural products and
expressions.
It is also important to Indigenous peoples' perspectives on intellectual
property, that reforms incorporate concepts of collective
rights, provide for
the protection of cultural products and manifestations that exceed the fifty
year limit required under existing
will enable greater control by communities over decisions about the wider uses
cultural products and expressions. Reforms may also consider ways of
introducing measures that will enable Indigenous communities
financial benefits that might derive from the utilisation by the wider community
of their cultural products and expressions.
This would be an important step
forward in the achievement of greater economic empowerment for Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander
peoples. Issues to be raised during consultations about
possible new legislation will therefore aim to include:
the definitions and nature of Indigenous intellectual property;
the range of cultural products and expressions that should be protected by
new legislation, including whether this should include
secret-sacred
how new legislation might operate to provide for community-level decision
making over uses of cultural expressions and manifestations;
how new legislation might enable communities to determine the extent, and
the mode of distribution of benefits received from, uses
of their cultural
expressions and manifestations.
The consultants' report will be submitted to the ATSIC Board of
Commissioners, and a report with recommendations will then be presented
IDC, which will provide an important contribution to the development of a
response to the

What to Do about Copyright Infringements
by Carolyn Cerexhe
The National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Association Inc (NIAAA) was set up to
protect and advocate for Indigenous artists.
If anyone has a query about the authenticity of artwork they have come
across, or purchased, they can get in touch with NIAAA for
Lydia Miller, Executive Director of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Arts Board of the Australia Council, says that the Australia
Council quite
regularly refers queries to NIAAA from around Australia. The Council has found
that there are still many examples of
work submitted to them for funding which
contravene copyright of other artists by using designs such as X-ray, Rarrk,
cross-hatching,
specific dot designs, Quinkan or Wadjina.

The publication includes discussion of the types of appropriation which are
of concern to Indigenous peoples, together with sections
on analytical
approaches to Indigenous cultural material and on contemporary art practice. The

material given under customary Indigenous law, and discusses the strengths and
