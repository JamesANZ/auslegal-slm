(the younger), meeting for discharge.
Although this insolvent had been opposed during the several previous meetings, and much evidence gone into, leading to
exhibit his conduct in a light very unsatisfactory, no creditor now appeared to oppose the discharge.
The Commissioner observed that the Insolvent Law was designed to protect the fair trader against fraudulent debtors; and
the burden and responsibility of himself, as Commissioner, was vastly increased, when, as in the present case, after there had been
long investigations, he was left to put in force the powers of the law, without the sanction of parties most deeply interested. Where
creditors had, as in the present case, legitimate grounds for opposing an insolvent's discharge, they should come forward and
do so; it was their imperative duty, not only on their own account, but for the benefit of the trading community. The creditors,
in order that the provisions of the act might be efficiently carried out, had a most important party to play and it was to be deeply
regretted that, in too many instances, this duty was neglected. The insolvent had assigned over to his father, and executed a power
of attorney, at a period when he owed sums of Â£540 odd; and before the declaration of insolvency, he had contracted
debts, in a comparatively short time, of Â£1600. He had also given a preference to some creditors, over others, when
his circumstances were such as he could not meet his liabilities. He regretted that not a single creditor was present on this occasion,
but he would take time to consider.
The insolvent was ordered to come up for judgment that day three weeks.
