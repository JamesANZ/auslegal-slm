16 July 2010 Brett Fritsch died in an industrial accident. His partner, Ms
Deborah Athans, sought and obtained compensation pursuant
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
for herself and their son Ryan
Fristsch on account of Mr Fritsch’s death.
is an infant, having been born on 18 May 2009. He is presently in receipt of a
weekly payment in the sum of $204.44 per week.
Athans, through her lawyers has negotiated with Return to Work SA to commute
that entitlement in the amount of $132,886.00. This
assumes the continuation of
weekly payments to age 21. This represents a compromise. Ryan could receive
weekly payments until the
age of 18. Depending upon his circumstances, he could
receive them to the age of 26 and perhaps longer.
Ms Athans and Ryan’s circumstances it is thought that the certainty and
flexibility that a present payment will bring
is a price worth paying to give up
any potential entitlement beyond the age of 21. They also recognise that
depending upon how things
pan out a commutation based upon the receipt of weekly
payments to the age of 21 might turn out to be generous.
read and considered Ms Athans’ affidavit and its annexures, including the
opinion of independent counsel, I am satisfied
that the receipt of a commutation
based upon the receipt of weekly payments to the age of 21 is a settlement that
is in the best
interests of Ryan to accept.
such, pursuant to rule 28(5) of the Workers Compensation Tribunal Rules 2009 I
approve the compromise.
now turn to the disposition of the settlement monies.
the basis of the material provided I am satisfied that Ms Athans is a mature and
competent person and am confident that she will
act in the best interests of
Ryan. I am satisfied that she is a fit and proper person to act as trustee for
Ryan in connection with
the settlement funds payable to Ryan as a consequence of
the commutation of his entitlements. As trustee she is authorized to invest
settlement sum and to apply it and any money derived from its investment for the
education, maintenance and support of Ryan until
Ryan attains majority. At that
time the balance will be payable to Ryan.
