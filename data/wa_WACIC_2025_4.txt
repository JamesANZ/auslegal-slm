Reasons for Decision
Adam Risi made an application for compensation under the
Criminal Injuries
Compensation Act 2003
(WA) (the CIC Act) arising out of an offence committed
by Joshua Michael Pym. Mr Pym was charged on indictment that on 26 February
at Greenmount he, with intent to maim, disfigure, disable or do some grievous
bodily harm to Barry Adam Risi, did grievous bodily
harm to Barry Adam Risi
contrary to s 294(1) of the
Criminal Code
Proceedings under the
Criminal Law (Mental Impairment) Act 2023
Criminal Law (Mental Impairment) Act
(WA) (the CLMI Act) came into
operation on 1 September 2024.
9 September 2024 Shepherd DCJ found Mr Pym unfit to stand trial.
special proceeding pursuant to subdivision 3 of the CLMI Act was heard before
his Honour Astill DCJ on 5 – 7 March 2025.
DCJ found the charge against Mr Pym was proved beyond reasonable doubt and he
made a finding Mr Pym committed the offence
pursuant to s 41(2)(c) of the CLMI
The interplay between the CLMI Act and the CIC Act
7 of the CLMI Act provides amendments to s 15 of the CIC Act. Section 315 of the
CLMI Act amends s 15(1)(b) by deleting
the word ‘mentally.’ The word
‘mentally’ is also deleted from the heading of s 15 as noted in s
CLMI Act does not make any other amendments to the CIC Act.
a finding is made that the accused committed the offence under s 41(2)(c) of the
CLMI Act, the court must not enter a judgment
of conviction but must make an
order under pt 5 of the CLMI
12 of the CIC Act makes provision for a compensation application where a person
has suffered injury as a consequence of a
proved offence. The term ‘proved
offence’ is defined in s 3 of the CIC Act as ‘a crime, misdemeanour
offence of which a person has been convicted.’ Given a finding
under s 41(2)(c) of the CLMI Act does not mean there has been
a judgment of
conviction, this application cannot be considered pursuant to s 12 of the CIC
15 of the CIC Act makes provision for a compensation application where a person
has suffered injury as a consequence of an
alleged offence in circumstances
where the accused person is found to be unfit to stand trial.
Mr Pym was found unfit to stand trial, I have considered this application
pursuant to s 15(4)(a) of the CIC Act. I am satisfied
on the balance of
probabilities the claimed injury occurred as a consequence of the commission of
the alleged offence given Astill
DCJ’s finding Mr Pym committed the
offence pursuant to s 41(2)(c) of the CLMI Act. The standard of proof for
special proceedings
is the criminal standard of beyond reasonable
CIC Act does not contemplate a finding under s 41 of the CLMI Act after a
special proceeding and therefore there is no specific
provision that reflects
this procedure.
the evidence being heard in a special proceeding and no conviction being
recorded, the facts have been determined by a superior
court and therefore, I
have adopted Astill DCJ’s findings when making my determination, in
accordance with the principle that
the facts in subsequent civil proceedings
will be established as those found by the trial judge in criminal proceedings:
Bennett v The State of Western Australia
[2012] WASCA 70
[2023] WADC 8.

(a) Penetrating
wounds to the orbit and brain along with an intracranial haemorrhage;
(b) Superficial
stab wounds to the anterior and posterior chest and the posterior neck;
(c) Fractures
to the areas of the face surrounding the orbital socket. This consisted of a
sphenoid sinus fracture72 and a lateral
maxillary face fracture;
(d) Bleeding
behind the eye which had resulted in an ‘orbital compartment
syndrome’ and associated optic nerve
dysfunction.
DCJ also found Mr Risi has been left with residual symptoms consisting of
blurred and double vision that interfere with his
ability to read and to do fine
point work. However, the evidence before him did not allow Astill DCJ to make a
finding as to what
degree these residual injuries are likely to be
