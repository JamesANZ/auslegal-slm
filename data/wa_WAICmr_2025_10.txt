Decision D00102025 – Published in note form only
Harrison and City of Joondalup
[2025] WAICmr 10
Decision: 31 October 2025
Freedom of Information Act 1992
For the reasons given to the parties and
summarised below, the Acting Information Access Deputy Commissioner (
A/FOI Deputy Commissioner
) found the decision of the City of Joondalup
) to refuse Mark Harrison (
the complainant
) access to
documents, under
Freedom of Information Act 1992
the FOI Act
), was justified and confirmed the agency’s decision.
On 17 February 2022, the complainant applied to the agency under the FOI
Act for access to a broad range of documents, which included:
phone records of
named Council members;
correspondence
between those Council members, named members of Parliament and other named third
parties; and
correspondence
relating to a particular development application.
application specified that the requested correspondence included mobile phone
text messages.
By notice of decision dated 1 April 2022, the agency
identified 29 documents within the scope of the complainant’s access
application
and, in the main, gave him access to edited copies of those
The complainant considered additional documents should exist
within the scope of his access application. By internal review decision
26 April 2022, the agency confirmed its initial decision and advised further
documents could not be found or did not exist.
Effectively, the agency refused
the complainant access to further documents under section 26 of the FOI Act
Subsequently, on 20 June 2022, the complainant
applied to the Information Commissioner (
the Commissioner
external review of the agency’s decision, maintaining his claim that
further documents existed. In particular, the complainant
claimed further text
messages and emails between the named Council members and the named third
parties existed.
The agency provided the Commissioner with its FOI file
maintained in respect of the complainant’s access application. One of
Commissioner’s officers (
the officer
) made inquiries with the
parties and obtained additional information.
On 21 February 2024, the
officer provided the parties with his assessment of the matter, which was that
the Commissioner was likely
to consider, on the information then before this
office, that the agency’s decision to, in effect, refuse the complainant
to further documents under section 26 was justified. The complainant did
not accept the officer’s assessment and provided
further submissions.
Section 26 provides that an agency may refuse access to a document if
all reasonable steps have been taken to locate the document,
and it is satisfied
that the document is either in the agency’s possession but cannot be
found, or does not exist. The Commissioner
considers, in dealing with section
26, the following questions must be answered:
there reasonable grounds to believe the requested documents exist, or should
exist and are, or should be, held by the agency?
those questions are answered in the affirmative, the next question is, has the
agency taken all reasonable steps to locate those
observed in
Re Boland and City of Melville
[1996] WAICmr 53
question is not whether an agency has taken every possible step to locate
documents, but whether it has taken all reasonable
steps. The adequacy of an
agency’s efforts to locate documents is to be judged having regard to what
was reasonable in the
circumstances: see
Re Leighton and Shire of
[2008] WAICmr 52
Re Leighton
) at [85] and
Veale and City of Swan
[2012] WAICmr 12.
The A/FOI Deputy
Commissioner considered the material before her including the searches and
inquiries the agency conducted and the
complainant’s submissions. The
A/FOI Deputy Commissioner was satisfied the agency had taken all reasonable
steps to find the
requested documents and that further documents (including
further text messages) either could not be found or do not exist.
A/FOI Deputy Commissioner was of the view that, requiring the agency to conduct
a forensic examination of mobile phones and other
electronic devices, including
metadata searches, as the complainant suggested, went beyond ‘all
reasonable steps’.
The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner accepted that,
if there was evidence before her to suggest the requested documents had been
or destroyed to prevent the agency from giving access to them,
‘all reasonable steps’ might include a forensic examination
agency’s electronic devices: see for example,
Re Leighton
[98]-[99]. However, there was no such evidence before the A/FOI Deputy
Commissioner.
The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner noted it is not her role to
examine in detail an agency’s record keeping practices, but rather
ensure that agencies are aware of their responsibilities under the FOI Act.
This includes highlighting deficiencies in an agency’s
record keeping
practices that may impact upon the proper functioning of the FOI Act, where such
deficiencies are uncovered in the
course of an external review: see
and Town of Claremont
[2009] WAICmr 36
During the external
review, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner had regard to the agency’s record
keeping policies in relation to
text messages sent to or by Council members that
relate to the business of the agency. The agency’s record keeping plan
that text messages are a type of record that should be created and
captured in the agency's record keeping system whenever they relate
business of the agency. However, the plan does not describe the actions Council
members should take to capture appropriately
text messages in the agency’s
record keeping system.
Given the widespread use of mobile phones for
communicating information by ordinary text messaging applications, messaging
applications
such as WhatsApp and Facebook messenger and even by way of social
media posts and their responses (collectively
text messages
’), the A/FOI
Deputy Commissioner considered it is reasonable to expect local government
Council members to receive text messages
that relate to the business of their
local government. Noting that good record keeping underpins the right of access
to documents
under the FOI Act, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner observed that
local government agencies should have policies and/or procedures outlining
steps required to capture text messages that relate to local government business
into an agency’s record keeping systems.
This should help ensure text
messages sent to or by Council members are appropriately captured in an
agency’s record keeping
systems, and can be readily located, including in
response to an FOI application.
Deputy Commissioner noted that, without clear guidelines, there is a higher risk
text messages recording significant decisions
and discussions will not be
appropriately retained. This may lead to an incomplete record of an
agency’s actions and decisions,
undermining the public’s ability to
fully understand and scrutinise those actions. Missing records can result in
significant
information gaps, weakening an agency’s transparency and
accountability.
Nevertheless, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner did not
consider the agency’s record keeping practices in this case adversely
the complainant’s right of access to documents, or prevented the
complainant from obtaining access to documents within the
scope of his access
application.
