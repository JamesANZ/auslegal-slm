REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
On 7 April 2004 pursuant to
section 129
Plumbing and Drainage Act 2002
applicant filed in the Tribunal an application to review a decision of the
Plumbers and Drainers Licensing Board ("the Board")
said to have been made on 21
January 2004 and advised to the applicant by letter dated 4 February 2004,
received on 9 February 2004,
requiring the applicant to provide proof of the
applicant’s enrolment in or completion of certain courses failing which
application would be considered to be withdrawn.

deal with the matter as the
is an empowering
as defined in Schedule 2 of
On the basis that the
applicant received the advice from the Board on 9 February 2004 as he says,
section 129
requires the application to be filed by 8 March 2004. The
Board agreed to an extension of time within which to file the application
April 2004.
On 8 July 2004 the respondent
filed an application seeking an order that the application be dismissed for want
of jurisdiction.
The applicant completed an
apprenticeship in or about 1965. In 1996 he was granted an interim licence on
the condition that he completed
certain training courses. In 2000 he was again
granted an interim licence on the same condition.
By letter dated 10 November
2003 the respondent informed the applicant that that his provisional licence
(formerly known as interim
licence) would expire on 1 January
On 5 January 2004 the Board
received an application dated 23 December 2003 from the applicant in which he
applied for a full licence
as he was thought that if he supplied competence
certificates, in Forms 29 and 30, that he would be licensed by the respondent.
The respondent says that is not correct.
On 21 January 2004 the
respondent considered the application. It requested the applicant to provide
proof of enrolment in or completion
of certain courses by 1 March 2004, failing
which the application would be considered withdrawn.
As the applicant did not
supply the requested proof the respondent informed him by letter dated 25 March
2004 that his application
was considered

(a) is dissatisfied with the decision; or
(b) was not given an information notice about the decision.
The applicant or licensee may apply for a review of the
decision as if it were a reviewable decision under the
Commercial and Consumer
Tribunal Act 2003
The application must be made within 28 days
(a) if the applicant or licensee is given an information notice about the

The Commercial and Consumer Tribunal may, in reviewing

(a) confirm the original decision; or
(b) amend the original decision; or
(c) substitute another decision for the original decision; or
(d) set aside the original decision and return the matter to the board
with the directions the tribunal considers appropriate.
In substituting another decision for the original
decision, the tribunal has the same powers as the board in making the original
The tribunal may decide that an unsuccessful applicant for a licence be
licensed either
unconditionally or on particular conditions.
If the tribunal amends the original decision or
substitutes another decision for the original decision, the amended or
substituted
decision is, for this
(other than this division) taken to be the
decision of the board.
If the tribunal decides to impose conditions on a
licence, the tribunal must--
(a) state the reasons for the decision; and
(b) decide and state the review period applying to the conditions.
There has been a long history
of dealing between the applicant, others on his behalf, and the Board prior to
the filing of the application
in the Tribunal.
The history emerges from
some of the material filed by the applicant. One such document is page 1 of a
letter dated 1 February 2001
from one Minister of the Crown to another relating
to Mr Smith’s case. That page sets out that the Board requires Mr Smith
"undertake both the plumbers and drainers licensing courses. The reason... is
that Mr Smith has not undertaken any further training
since he failed the theory
component of his apprenticeship in 1965. In addition, there have been many
changes in legislation, codes
and regulations governing plumbing and draining in
Queensland since that time."
Details of three ways in which the courses
could be undertaken are set out in the letter.
Also attached to the
applicant’s filed material is a copy of his results in the Apprenticeship
Trade Course between the years
1961 and 1965. The results indicate that of 15
subjects (2 of which are illegible) the applicant passed 7 subjects and failed 8
The applicant does not appear
to accept that he is required to or should be required to meet the
qualifications for a licence set
out in Schedule 1 of the Plumbing and Draining
The applicant informed the
Tribunal on 7 May 2004 that he considered that he was not capable of fulfilling
the educational requirements
Notwithstanding that it is
not directly relevant to the issue to be determined by the Tribunal, I have set
out the history of dealing
between the parties in some detail for the assistance
of those who read this decision.
The issue for determination
by the Tribunal is whether or not it has jurisdiction to hear the
applicant’s application for review.
This has been explained to the parties
who have advised that they understand this.
In this case because there is
by the Board which is capable of review, the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction in relation to this application. This position arises

paragraphs.

the stated time, the applicant:
(a) does not comply with a requirement under subsection

after the Board receives the application.
In this case the Board
received the application on 5 January
By letter dated
4 February 2004 (within the 40 business days required under
section 38(5))
the applicant was requested to provide
"either a certified copy of your
current enrolment in, or evidence of having successfully completed"
Licensed Plumbing and Licensed Draining courses by I March 2004. The letter goes
on to state that
"If you do not comply with this requirement, your
application will be considered to be withdrawn

The applicant did not provide
the required documents to the
Pursuant to section 38(4) the
applicant is therefore taken to have withdrawn the application before it was
decided by the Board. The
result is that because the Board made no decision,
there is none to review.
It follows that the Tribunal
has no jurisdiction and the application must be
The respondent seeks its
costs of the application. The respondent expresses these as being its
preparation and time costs, as well
as the costs to it of a Service Level
Agreement between the Board and the Department of Tourism Fair Trading and Wine
Industry Development
pursuant to which applications to review decisions of the
Board under the Act are heard by the Tribunal as an independent quasi judicial
The respondent is a self
represented litigant whose representative is not legally qualified. There is an
established line of authority
that a litigant in person who is not a solicitor
is not entitled to claim costs.
More significantly, however,
as the Tribunal is created by statute, it has only those powers given to it by
the legislature. In Horne’s
His Honour Judge McGill dealt
with the position in cases in which a court of inferior jurisdiction has no
express power to award
costs in a case in which it has no jurisdiction.
At paragraph 26 of His
Honour’s decision, he says
"Most of these authorities can be reconciled
in the manner set out in a helpful Article by A. J. Snelling in
(1935) 8 ALJ
, which stated that they support these
propositions:
(1) In the absence of statutory provision, where an inferior court created
by statute decides that it has no jurisdiction in the matter
then such court has
no jurisdiction to make any order in respect of costs...."
Those comments apply with
equal, if not greater, force to the Tribunal. As was said by His Honour Justice
"the power must at least appear

generally expressed power does not imply a power which is not otherwise stated
and which relates to a matter which is not within
the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. The Explanatory Notes to the Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Bill
appear to confirm this. The
relevant part states

broad powers to carry out its functions. The tribunal may do all things
