CASE(S) REFERRED TO
IN DECISION:
ABBREVIATED REASONS FOR DECISION
Remove and install new stacking doors as per original discussion and
confirmed in emails 29/01/2010 and 07/02/2010.
The Building Disputes Tribunal (the “BDT”) was not satisfied on
the evidence that the stacking doors are faulty or unsatisfactory
in that they
function as designed and are fit for their purpose and comply with all relevant
standards and the Building Code of Australia
The Complainants’ allegation that the doors present an unacceptable
tripping hazard was not supported by evidence other than
the observation in the
report of Mr Barney Jones at folio 414 of the hearing booklet:
“... and a raised threshold detail which will promote a liability
problem in the event of an accident.”
Mr Jones’ report provided no further comment on this issue and he was
not called by the Complainants to clarify the reasons
for such a statement.
There was no evidence that the raised door sill did not comply with the BCA and
relevant Australian standards.
The contractual documents do not specify the method of installation of the
doors and there is nothing to indicate that the door system
was to be set flush
with the structural floor slab rather than set upon the slab as installed. The
drawings prepared on behalf of
the Complainants indicates the stacking doors
are to be installed at finished floor level o courses but the
Complainants
accept that this is not correct and an upstand is necessary in order to
comply with the necessary standards and the BCA.
The email communications between the parties do not amount to an agreed
variation to the contract.
The Complainants also failed to prove to the BDT’s satisfaction that
the installed stacking doors are the incorrect size.
The Respondent disputed the claims that the doors were faulty or
unsatisfactory or in breach of the contract.
We find insufficient evidence was led by the Complainants to prove the
complaint under either
Builders’ Registration Act 1939
(WA) on the balance of
probabilities.
The complaint is therefore dismissed.
Vanity cabinet to ensuite not installed in accordance with contract
The Complainants’ drawings show the ensuite vanity unit as a built-in
cabinet. The contract specifications provide a provisional
sum of $1200.00 for
a vanity (to be selected by the Complainants).
The Complainants selected a free standing vanity unit rather than a custom
built-in cabinet. The selection was not clearly documented
and a 1500mm wide
unit was delivered.
The Complainants held discussions with the Respondent about the size and
installation of the unit.
The Complainants claim the Respondent has installed the wrong unit and a unit
1800mm wide was selected. There is no evidence to prove
on the balance of
probability that the Complainants selected a unit other than that which was
installed. It is clear that the Complainants
did not select a built-in cabinet
as shown on their drawings. There was no evidence that the selected unit comes
in difference sizes
or that any larger size would fit the available
The documentation is not satisfactory but we do not find the evidence proves
on the balance of probabilities that the Respondent has
breached the contract by
installing a unit that was not selected by the Complainants or that the
installation is faulty or unsatisfactory.
The complaint is dismissed.
