applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from part of the judgment of the Court of
Appeal of the Supreme Court of
New South Wales (Ward A‑CJ, Leeming and Kirk JJA), which dismissed the
applicant's appeal from
a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales
(Stevenson J).
proposed appeal is not an appropriate vehicle to consider the questions raised
and, in any event, lacks sufficient prospects
of success to warrant the grant of
special leave to appeal. Further, it cannot be said that the administration of
justice supports
the grant of special leave. It would therefore be futile to
grant the extension of time that is sought.
leave to appeal is refused with costs.
