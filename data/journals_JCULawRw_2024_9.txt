The underlying question is: what does natural justice require? This differs
depending on the circumstances of the case. Part of the
context that can be
considered when applying the test is the role of the decision-maker. Justice
Callinan illustrated this in the
context of ministerial decision-making through
the analogy that a Minister wears ‘two hats, one as a member of the
Executive, and another as a person whom a power as a decision-maker is
entrusted’.
His Honour went on to explain the tensions between the roles of such a
decision-maker:
As a Minister of State he will have a role and involvement in the formulation
and implementation of government policy. That policy
may be to seek to change
existing laws, because, in his or the government’s opinion, those laws do
not reflect government policy
or they are not readily capable of application, or
because they are being misapplied. One important and conventional means of
such a change is to draw public attention to the current operation of
the existing laws. This is a legitimate public function of
an elected member of
the Executive. That he may have another role requiring him faithfully to give
effect to the existing laws should

have been made and inquiries have been

that, in those circumstances, a minister has a ‘continuing relationship
with a particular
issue or particular person during the course of which they
necessarily form views’.
In fact, a minister ‘may have quite advanced views about the merits of a
particular [decision] well before it falls for ultimate
determination’.
, Gleeson CJ and Gummow J held that:
decision-makers, including judicial decision-makers, sometimes approach their
task with a tendency of mind, or predisposition, sometimes
one that has been
publicly expressed, without being accused or suspected of bias. The question is
not whether a decision-maker’s
mind is blank; it is whether it is open to
persuasion. ... Natural justice does not require the absence of any

Her Honour expanded on this finding by detailing the three features of the
statements that could give rise to an apprehension of bias.
The first was the statements which suggested the Australian Government had
already made a commitment to the residents of Kimba that
the radioactive waste
facility would be in Napandee.
This was exemplified in the letters explaining the site-specific Amendment Bill
to the public and the Facebook post on 18 November
2020 about delivering on
promises to the Kimba community.
While Minister Pitt did not state how, when and by whom the commitment or
promise was made, this still would have led a fair-minded
observer to consider

While accepting this was a
political statement, her Honour stated: ‘It is not the case that
everything said in political discourse

statutory power.’
The third finding was related to statements made by Minister Pitt that
‘impliedly postulate what would occur if the Amendment

Charlesworth found that these statements conveyed the need for certainty for the

As noted above in Part

decision-making allows consideration for the multiple hats worn by ministers.

decision-maker about the decision
For example, Minister
Pitt told Mr Bilney ‘he should stop opposing the Bill because the
government had’ made a
Lastly, statements about how one group’s opposition would be
disadvantageous to the interests of another can also lead to an
apprehension of
The Minister had also
made statements about how those in opposition would create uncertainty for the
residents of Kimba through ‘endless
rounds of court
proceedings’.
these statements, Charlesworth J held that ‘[c]onsidered as a whole, the
evidence discloses that Minister Pitt took sides
in a divided community in a way

Reconciling Jia Legeng and Barngarla
is the seminal case for bias in the ministerial
decision-making process and
involved the cancellation of two visas by the
responsible minister due to the visa-holders being of bad character. The
responsible
minister in that case made various statements on radio and in a
letter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal related to Jia Legeng’s
visa. The effect of these statements was that the responsible minister
considered Jia Legeng to be of bad character because of previous
offences and was seeking to cancel his visa. In a 4:1 majority, the High Court
held that the responsible minister could
not be apprehended to be biased when
cancelling the visa of Jia

With respect to the majority in

Justice Charlesworth’s view in
appears more aligned
with the dissenting opinion of Kirby J in
. Justice Kirby
placed a strong emphasis on the fact that the responsible minister’s
comments were specifically directed towards
the decision to revoke Jia
Legeng’s visa.
similar way, Charlesworth J emphasised the various responsible minister’s
statements about bringing certainty to the residents
Further, Kirby J noted that the political aspect of the decision to cancel
the visa of Jia Legeng could be considered in creating
His Honour believed
‘a reasonable bystander would ... conclude that it would take a
super-human dispassion and objectivity
for the Minister ... to confirm Mr
Jia’s visa to remain in
Australia’.
similar way the statements of Minister Pitt that Charlesworth J took issue with
related specifically to the predetermined decision
to select Napandee as the
site for the radioactive waste facility.
We agree with Kirby J’s analysis that the apprehended bias test should
be a ‘general impression derived from the evidence,
not a lawyer’s
fine verbal analysis’.
Going back to first principles, the test is whether ‘a fair-minded lay
observer might reasonably apprehend that the [decision-maker]
might not bring an
impartial mind to the resolution of the question the [decision-maker] is
required to decide’.
Acknowledging the political role of a minister, it defies logic that a minister
pushing a policy agenda that specifically relates
to a decision does not give
rise to an apprehension of an impartial mind; a minister will have a bias
towards deciding in line with
that policy
It is only fair ministers must make decisions in line with procedural
fairness requirements, irrespective of their political role.
We suggest Kirby
J’s dissenting rationale in
perfectly illustrates why
this should be the case:
If this Court does not adhere to these standards, Ministers, entrusted by
Parliament with extremely important decisions seriously
affecting the rights of
individuals, will be at liberty to make remarks in public about such individuals
and their applications and
then solemnly proceed, as the repository of statutory
power, to exercise the power adversely to such persons. It would be hard to
conceive of a practice more likely to undermine public confidence in the
independent and impartial decision-making of statutory decision-makers.
Ministers, as statutory decision-makers, like other persons entrusted to decide
the fate of individuals, must simply learn the rule
of reticence. They must
avoid the appearance and actuality of
prejudgment.
Whereas the reasonable observer might quite easily accept that such a
political office-holder has a large leeway for comment about
matters of public
policy or political philosophy, higher expectations are, in my view held in
relation to a decision by such a person,
pursuant to legislation, particular to
an identified individual. In such a case, the Minister would be expected to
decide the matter
without invalidating
predispositions or prejudgment
or she would be required to do so solely by reference to the relevant facts of
the case and by application of the applicable
law. This is the price to be paid
for reposing such power on
Noting this was in the context of an individual’s rights, such
sentiment is equally applicable to a decision impacting a larger,
though still
relatively finite, group of people as in the
While Charlesworth J’s decision in
is distinguishable
, we believe her Honour’s decision and Kirby
J’s dissenting opinions reflect what should be the true nature of the
apprehended
bias test. Namely, broad political statements about policy will not
give rise to apprehended bias, but a minister expressing views
on the specific
outcome of a decision — even if that is part of advocating for a policy
mandate — can create an apprehension
of bias invalidating a decision.
VIII Conclusion
The outcome of
was to set aside the decision of Minister
Pitt to declare Napandee as the site for a radioactive waste facility due to
apprehended
bias on the part of the Minister. While the law generally recognises
the political and decision-making roles of a minister as separate,
Charlesworth
J found that statements in the political discourse can infect the impartiality
of a decision. We are of the opinion
that the judgment accurately reflects what
the true nature of the apprehended bias test should be. This view finds support
J’s powerful dissent in
, where His Honour
persuasively outlined the rationale as to why this should be the case. We
suggest the distinction between political
and decision-making hats of a
ministerial decision-maker is a difficult concept to understand. A minister can
wear as many hats as
they like, but the mind sitting below those hats remains

Further, given the
contest between renewable and non-renewable energy sources and the locations of
the relevant facilities will remain
the topic of debate in the political sphere
for many years to come, we anticipate that many Napandee-type decisions may have

need to adopt a fine balancing act to ensure that their conduct
