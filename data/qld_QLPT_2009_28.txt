LEGAL PRACTICE TRIBUNAL
MR M D WOODS
DR J LAMONT
No 10497 of 2008
SERVICES COMMISSIONER
BRONWYN LOUISE HAY
..DATE 24/11/2009
HER HONOUR: These are the reasons of the Tribunal for making the
following orders. Upon the undertaking of the respondent to pay
the sum of $900
to the applicant within 28 days to enable that sum to be refunded to the
complainant for the fees charged by the
respondent for legal services provided
to the complainant on 30 March 2007, it is ordered:
1) the respondent is publicly reprimanded
2) that for a period of 12 months after the respondent recommences legal
practice (whether as an employee or a principal) the respondent
must arrange for
supervision to be available to her by another legal practitioner approved for
that purpose by the Queensland Law
3) the respondent must pay the applicant's costs of the discipline
application, if not agreed, to be assessed on the standard basis
for a Supreme
Court trial.
The Tribunal found the respondent guilty of charge 1 and that the conduct
should be characterised as unsatisfactory professional conduct
in Legal Services
Commissioner v Hay [2009] LPT 27 (the reasons).
Aspects of the respondent's history in legal practice are set out in the
reasons at paragraph 21. She was the sole principal of the
family law practice
that she was conducting at the time that she was engaged by the complainant Ms
Whittaker. She continued as principal
of that practice until she ceased in
practice on 19 May 2008. On 24 February 2009 the respondent voluntarily
surrendered her practising
certificate and that has continued to be the position
until the present time.
The hearing of four disciplinary charges took place on 24 August 2009.
The reasons were delivered on 19 November 2009. The respondent
was found guilty
of charge 1 only. Charges 2, 3 and 4 were found not to be proved. Oral
submissions were made to the Tribunal today
by Mr McMillan of counsel on behalf
of the applicant, supplemented by written submissions that were filed by leave.
Oral submissions
were made by Mr Morris QC on behalf of the respondent.
The main areas of dispute between the parties as to the penalty that
should be imposed were on whether or not a public reprimand should
be given and
whether there were exceptional circumstances that enabled the Tribunal to make
an order for costs, other than that the
respondent pay the applicant's costs of
the discipline application.
I will not recite the facts that underpin charge 1 or the other facts
that resulted in the bringing of charges 2, 3 and
4. Those matters
are set out in full in the reasons. In deciding that a public reprimand is
appropriate, the Tribunal considered
the nature of the conduct that was proved
in relation to charge 1. The respondent was guilty of carelessness or
incompetence that
was characterised only as unsatisfactory professional conduct
because of her mental state at the time.
Disciplinary orders are not punitive, but are made for protection of the
public. General deterrence is an important aspect of the
disciplinary orders.
The nature of the respondent's conduct was such that it is appropriate that
other practitioners be deterred
from committing the same carelessness or
incompetence.
Although I am mindful of my concern that I have expressed on previous
occasions about the need to avoid falling into the routine of
automatically
ordering a public reprimand where a respondent has been found guilty of a
charge, I consider that in the circumstances
this is a category of case where a
public reprimand is appropriate.
Mr Morris suggested that to a member of the public a public reprimand has
implicit within it that some dishonesty has been committed.
My understanding of
the cases in which a public reprimand has been ordered is that it is frequently
applied where there has been
no suggestion or finding of dishonesty or
fraudulent conduct. Whether a public reprimand is appropriate depends on the
circumstances
of the particular case and I consider that this case is one of
In relation to the question of supervision, Mr Morris did not oppose an
order in the general terms that was proposed by the applicant.
There was some
debate about whether the order proposed by the applicant meant that the Law
Society would not issue the respondent
with a practising certificate to enable
her to practice as a principal. There should be no debate about that. The
medical evidence
that is before the Tribunal does not preclude the respondent
practising as a principal.
Some level of supervision available to the respondent is appropriate in
the circumstances and the terms of the order that I have already
indicate that the type of supervision is one that should be arranged by the
respondent but the name of the legal practitioner
should be approved for that
purpose by the Law Society. The supervision is not a strict regime, it is one
that is available for
the respondent.
Some protection for the public is implicit in the sense that any legal
practitioner who makes himself or herself available for the
supervision of another practitioner to implement an order made by this Tribunal
will obviously accept some responsibility
for ensuring that that practitioner
does make himself or herself available to the respondent.
In relation to costs, the position under
section 461(2)
Profession Act 2007
is that the respondent must pay the applicant's costs of the
discipline application unless there are exceptional circumstances to
otherwise. Some assistance in what exceptional circumstances may be can be
gleaned from the approach in Legal Services Commissioner
v Scott No 2 [2009] LPT
9. Reference to the manner in which the relevant provision must be applied was
also made by the Court of
Appeal in Legal Services Commissioner v Bradshaw
[2009] QCA 126
at paragraph 63.
This was a matter in which charges 2 and 3 arose out of the same factual
matrix as charge 1. Charge 4 arose out of the investigation
of charges 1, 2 and
3. Although the psychiatric evidence was particularly relevant to the
applicant's failure to prove charges 2
and 3, and had some relevance to charge
4, the applicant's failure to prove charges 2, 3 and 4 also depended on the
evidence of the
respondent herself which was not available in the form of a very
detailed affidavit until the last business day before the hearing
Although some foreshadowing of the evidence of the mental state of the
respondent was provided by the then solicitors of the respondent
applicant in March 2008, and it appears that the treating psychiatrist's reports
of April 2008 may have also have been provided
to the applicant at or about the
time they were first made available in April 2008, the mere raising of the
psychiatric aspect of
the respondent's defence was not sufficient to put the
matter on a basis that the applicant was in a position of confidently being
to withdraw or resile from the charges at that stage.
In the circumstances, the Tribunal is therefore satisfied that this is
not a case where exceptional circumstances have been shown
to enable the
exercise of a discretion to make a costs order other than the order that is
indicated by
section 462(1)
of the Act. These are the reasons therefore for
making the orders that I outlined at the commencement of these reasons.
