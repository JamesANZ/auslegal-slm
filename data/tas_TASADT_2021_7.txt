8. Pursuant to s98A, the Tribunal has a discretion to approve
the withdrawal of a complaint from inquiry when it receives such an
application.

may also continue to conduct an inquiry
in the circumstances set out in
9. In assessing whether or not to approve the withdrawal of the
complaint, it is necessary to have regard to:
(a) the nature of the complaint; and
complainant’s reasons for withdrawing the complaint.
10. It is against that background that issues of public
interest can be assessed.
11. On behalf of THS it is submitted:
• It treats all allegations of discrimination and
prohibited conduct seriously and it made enquiries to attempt to gain further
information to assist with an appropriate course of action in this
• It does not condone actions which are discriminatory and
undertakes to ensure all employees, patients and contractors are
made to feel

measures to address the alleged
behaviour and support the complainant to perform her duties in a safe and
welcoming environment.

assist the agency and its employees in ensuring that the LGBTIQ+ community is
supported and made to feel welcome within the workplace.

September 2021, the Associate Judge issued a general order to show cause why
decisions made by the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner to accept the complaint
and amend the complaint to add the THS as a respondent
should not be quashed.
That application has been adjourned pending the decision of this Tribunal as to
whether or not to approve
the withdrawal of the complaint.
complainant has resolved her complaint as against the two individual employees
who allegedly discriminated against her on
the basis of gender and/or sexual
orientation and who allegedly engaged in offensive, humiliating, insulting,
intimidating or ridiculing
conduct on the basis of gender and/or sexual
orientation and which a reasonable person having regard to all the circumstances
have anticipated the complainant would be offended, humiliated, insulted,
intimidated or ridiculed.
14. The only outstanding issue is whether the THS
complied with its obligations under s104 of the Act.
15. The complainant has
received legal advice about her complaint. However, she is now
self-represented. In the complainant’s
emails she has advised that she is
unwell and wishes to discontinue the complaint as against the THS.

argument about whether the complainant can pursue
a complaint against the
17. The Tribunal is satisfied that the complainant has voluntarily
sought to withdraw her complaint. She has obtained some relief
individuals concerned with respect to her complaint.
18. The Tribunal does
not consider it would be in the public interest to conduct its own inquiry into
the complaint.
19. On balance, the Tribunal has determined to approve the
complainant’s withdrawal of her complaint against the THS.

evidence in respect of this complaint in circumstances
where she has resolved
her complaint against the individuals involved and due to her health does not
wish to pursue the matter further.
21. The Tribunal, having considered the application made by the
complainant on 15 September 2021 to withdraw her complaint, approves
