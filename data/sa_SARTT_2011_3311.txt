Hearing 14 January 2014 at Adelaide
SCHULTZ & WATTON v COSTIN (by Marley Duncan Real
Estate) (RT11/3311)
Application by tenants seeking an order to terminate the tenancy on the
grounds of undue hardship - son diagnosed with autism and
was allocated a place
in an appropriate school some distance away. Application opposed by agent. RTT
finds that grounds under S 89
made out and terminates the tenancy.
The application seeks an order terminating the tenancy on the ground of undue
hardship and for compensation. The Tribunal has the
power to terminate a tenancy
on the ground of undue hardship under
Residential Tenancies
Terms of the Residential Tenancy Agreement
Rental premises: 9 Redbanks Road Willaston SA 5118
Landlord: Maureen

Watton & Karl Schultz

Rent: $285.00 per week,

Security Bond: $1,620.00 was paid by the tenant and lodged with the

Sworn evidence was given at the hearing by:
The landlord’s agent: Hayley Marley Duncan
tenant: Alivia Watton & Karl Schultz
Advocate for
the tenant Alison Randle
of the Act states:
(1) If the continuation of a residential tenancy would result in undue
hardship to the landlord or the tenant, the Tribunal may,
on application by the
landlord or the tenant, terminate the agreement from a date specified in the
Tribunal's order and make an order
for possession of the premises as from that
(2) The Tribunal may also make an order compensating a landlord or tenant
for loss and inconvenience resulting, or likely to result,
from the early
termination of the tenancy.
This is a residential tenancy under the Residential Tenancies act, 1995
The grounds on which the application are made are stated in the application
and they are that the tenant’s five year old son
Kaleb who has a diagnosis
of Autism and is a client of Disability Services SA has secured a placement in
specialist schooling at
Tanunda commencing from the end of January 2014. The
tenants therefore seek early termination of the tenancy as it would cause
to them both in terms of their son’s condition, his
mother’s health and their finances to have a 20 minute drive each
the rental premises to Kaleb’s school at Tanunda.
I note the documentation as tendered by Ms Randle on behalf of the tenants
from the Disability SA psychologist, Ms Schmaal, the family
social worker, Ms
Dimmick at Gawler’s Children Centre and the Department of Education and
Children’s Services.
I have also heard the evidence of the tenants and that of Ms Marley Duncan.
Ms Marley Duncan opposes the application on instructions
from the landlord. I
note that the agents are advertising the premises and that a periodic inspection
of the premises in December
2013 was reasonably satisfactory. The premises had
been advertised since early December 2013. I further note Ms Marley
point that the December/January holiday period is not the best
time to terminate a tenancy. However now, the letting market is picking
The tenant’s have acquired a new rental premises from 21 January 2014
near to their son’s school. I note that the tenants
have been in the
existing rental for almost 4 years. However, their reason for leaving this
tenancy early implies no fault on the
landlord’s part.
I have considered all the circumstances of this case, I will terminate this
tenancy as at Tuesday 21 January 2014. The tenants should
pay rent to that day.
I further order that 3 weeks rental compensation, an amount of $855.00 along
with $15.00 for advertising and
$45.00 towards reletting fees be paid to the
At the end of this tenancy, there will be a final inspection and calculation
as to a water bill. I will therefore not release the
bond today. Consistent
with my order of compensation, the tenants now owe $915.00 of the bond to the
Pursuant to
Section 89(1)
of the Act, I terminate this tenancy, the
tenant must move out of the premises by 11.00am on Tuesday 21 January 2014
