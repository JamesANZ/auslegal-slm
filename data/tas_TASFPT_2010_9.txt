LA Arnold Pty Ltd v Forest Practices Authority [2010] TASFPT 9 (22 September 2010)
File No: 6/10 F D09/2010
LA Arnold Pty Ltd Appellant
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was a hearing of an appeal against the refusal of the Forest
Practices Authorities (FPA) to approve Forest Practices Plan (FPP)
MJF0247-01 at Steeles Hill Carlton River.
The appeal was heard at Hobart
on 27 August 2010.
Mr T Leaman and Dr P Bell appeared on behalf
of the Forest Practices Authority.
Mr L Arnold appeared on behalf of the
Practices Plan number MJF0247-01 (the FPP) was for harvesting and reforestation
of 344 ha of principally grassy
Eucalyptus globulus
forest, with other
Eucalyptus species, at Steeles Hill, Carlton River.
of the FPP was refused because it failed to identify and protect two nests
(“the nests”) of the Tasmanian wedge-tailed
(Aquila audax
located in the northwest corner of the FPP area; and also would
result in an unacceptable loss of Swift Parrot
(Lathamus Discolor)
appeal contested the refusal. The evidence was as follows.
evidence on behalf of the FPA was that it relied upon management tools including
the Threatened Fauna Advisor (the TFA)
The TFA is an expert decision
support system for threatened species in forestry situations. It is applied
pursuant to Section D3.3
of the Forest Practices Code, which requires that
Forest Practices Officers (FPO) in determining the management of threatened
in wood production areas,
inter alia,
consult the
TFA delivers endorsed management prescriptions (called "recommendations") for
threatened species in forestry situations. Under
the agreed procedures, the
evidence was, forest practices officers will obtain an endorsed management
prescriptions for the operation
area and incorporate this prescription into the
Tasmanian wedgetailed eagle and the Swift Parrot are classified as Endangered
under the Tasmanian
Threatened Species Protection Act
1995 and the
Commonwealth
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
proposed coupe falls within a swift parrot important breeding area (SPIBA) as
defined by the Fauna Strategic Planning Group (FSPG)
and contains both foraging
habitat and potential nesting habitat for this species. The area is considered
to be of great importance
to the species. The proposed harvesting has the
potential to significantly impact of upon the swift parrot values of this
particular, a large proportion of the proposed harvest area is comprised of
high-density foraging habitat, with some lower density
foraging habitat. Also, a
significant proportion of the proposed harvest area is mature forest and likely
to contain swift parrot
nesting habitat. The co-occurrence of nesting and
foraging habitat further increases its potential value to the swift
proposed operation would harvest approximately 25% of the remaining mapped
Eucalyptus globulus dry forest and woodland within
a 5 km radius of the coupe.
Approximately 55% of the area within a 5 km radius of the coupe has already been
cleared for agriculture,
urban development, plantation and other purposes. It is
also likely that there has been some degradation of swift parrot habitat
the remaining forested areas within a 5 km radius of the coupe through other
harvesting operations.
Recommendation
3 of the TFA for the wedge-tailed eagle is that there be no forestry activities
within 500m or a 1 kilometre line of
sight during the breeding season, and an
intact 10 ha nest reserve around a nest.
nests numbered 1321 and 1322 are located at Steeles Hill, and while number 1321
has been favoured as the primary breeding site
in recent years, with two
successful breeding attempts in the last three seasons, nest 1322 remains
important both as a territorial
flag, as a backup nesting site, and for other
a small number of known nest sites contribute to the population of wedge-tailed
eagles. This emphasises the importance of protecting
such sites from disturbance
to ensure that productive nest sites can continue to succeed in producing young;
nest 1321 is a frequently
productive nest site.
recommendation of the FPA based upon the above information, was that there be an
approximately 13 ha reserve around nest 1322,
and an approximately 14.5 ha
reserve around nest 1321. What was proposed in the FPP appealed against, was two
overlapping 10 ha reserves,
which on the evidence would be
inadequate.
above evidence was not contested and the Tribunal finds in accordance with
Tribunal is accordingly satisfied that the proposed FPP is not in accordance
with Recommendation 3 of the TFA, and therefore not
in accordance with agreed
procedures threatened fauna management. It is therefore not in accordance with
the Forest Practices Code,
and therefore contrary to the Forest Practices Act.
The latter is so with respect to the effect upon each of these threatened
Section 37(13) of the
Forest Practices Act
1985 the Tribunal is to take
into account the financial effect of its determination on the parties to the
appeal. The relevant financial
effect which on the evidence will be likely to
occur as a result of the present refusal is the loss of a substantial amount of
from the proposed harvesting operations. The Tribunal was satisfied
this will occur as a result of refusal of the FPP which is necessary
protection of the eagle nests, and protection of the swift parrot
appellant if the FPP is refused by the Tribunal for these reasons, has the
opportunity pursuant to the
Nature Conservation Act
2002, to apply to the
Minister for compensation. The Tribunal accordingly does not see the financial
effect of its determination
as justifying approval of the FPP when it should
otherwise be refused.
Conclusion and Decision
Tribunal considers that the refusal appealed against was appropriate having
regard to all the relevant matters. The decision
of the Tribunal is that the
refusal appealed against is upheld.
Tribunal will entertain any application for an order for costs in this appeal,
if made to the Tribunal in writing with supporting
submissions within the next
14 days. If requested the Tribunal will reconvene to hear any evidence in
respect of any matter bearing
on an order for costs.
the absence of any such application for an order for costs the order of the
Tribunal is that each party bears its own costs.
