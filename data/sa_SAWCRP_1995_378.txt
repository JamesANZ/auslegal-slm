Madigan v Port Augusta Hospital (No.4) [1995] SAWCRP 378 (24 July 1995)
[1995] SAWCRP 378
Review Officer
Catchwords:
Weekly payments of income maintenance
— entitlement extending to 65
birthday of worker —
Review Officer failing to specify this in decision — lack of “slip
rule” regarding Review
Officers’ decisions, but entitlement merely
extended and entitlement period found not interfered with — entitlement to
extend to worker’s birthday.
RE: MADIGAN AND PORT AUGUSTA HOSPITAL INC. (No.4)
(1995) 8 WCRP Determination
Determination No. 95-0378
Workers’ Compensation Review Panel
MADIGAN v. PORT AUGUSTA HOSPITAL Inc.
(00171003/02/01 and 02/02)
Determination of
Review Panel made on 24th July 1995
Review Officer Mason
This will serve as an addendum to my decision of 8th June 1995:
Madigan v. Port Augusta Hospital (No.3)
(1995) 8 WCRP Determination
[1995] SAWCRP 290.
On page 2 of that decision, I noted that the
parties had agreed the period of total incapacity arising at the time of the
laminectomy as 20th February 1992 to 31st May 1992.
been pointed out to me, however, that the period of claim in dispute extended
beyond 31st May 1992 to 14th July 1993—the
worker’s 65th birthday.
The worker was in receipt of Department of Social Security sickness benefits
from May 1992 to July
1993, since when I understand he has been in receipt of
the age pension.
The evidence does not indicate that the worker was in
receipt of any offers of suitable duties by the employer after May 1992. It
therefore seems an inevitable consequence of section 35 of the Act, as then in
force, that the worker is entitled to continuity of
payments, on a
partial-deemed-total basis, until his attainment of retirement age in
The Review Panel has no power to correct errors in its
determination: there is no “slip rule” in the Act. However, the
above does not contradict anything in my previous decision; it simply extends
it. I did not say payments should stop on 31st May
1992, but in awarding them
to that date I failed to address the situation after that date.
that the operative part of my decision, to be found at the foot of page 4 under
the heading “Determination”, confined
itself to acceptance of the
claim and did not expressly consider the period of weekly payments in respect of
incapacity, although
I did refer to the matter in the body of my reasons on page
2. It is now trite law that the jurisdiction of the Review Panel continues
until ancillary matters in dispute are disposed of: see
(1993) 61 SASR 487
[1993] SASC 4356.
It is implicit in my
earlier decision that I found an entitlement to payments in respect of total
incapacity from 20th February
1992 to 31st May 1992. I now indicate that
payments should continue, for the reasons above, until 14th July
