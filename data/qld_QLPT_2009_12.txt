[1] MULLINS J: The respondent was the solicitor who instructed Mr G Mullins of
counsel to represent his client, Mr White, at the
mediation of the
client’s personal injuries claim that resulted in the Tribunal finding
that barrister guilty of professional
misconduct: Legal Services Commissioner v
Mullins [2006] LPT 12 (Mullins). After that matter had been completed, the
commenced this discipline application on 25 June 2008 against the
respondent for one charge arising out of his role in the same mediation.
October 2008, the respondent filed a response to the particulars of the charge
in which most of the particulars were admitted.
The parties filed a statement
of agreed facts on 20 January 2009. The respondent by his solicitors’
letter dated 11 February
2009 (exhibit 2) made further admissions that left very
little in issue on the hearing of the application.
Summary of agreed facts
[2] Mr White who was born in 1953 suffered injuries in a motor vehicle
accident in April 2001 which resulted in quadriplegia. The
respondent notified
a claim to Suncorp-Metway Insurance Limited (Suncorp) as the insurer. The
respondent obtained an occupational
therapy assessment report dated 16 September
2002 prepared by Evidex Pty Ltd (Evidex) which the respondent provided to
That report stated that Mr White’s life expectancy had been
reduced by 20 per cent from that of a normal male of his age.
In October 2002
the respondent provided to Suncorp a work assessment report by an occupational
therapist on behalf of Evidex that
stated that, but for Mr White’s injury,
he would have continued to work in his trade as a builder until retirement.
[3] In November 2002 the respondent provided to Suncorp a copy of a forensic
accountant’s report prepared by Evidex that assessed
future earning capacity to age 65 years, but for the injury, at $934,178. The
mediation of Mr White’s claim
against Suncorp was arranged for 19
September 2003. Suncorp briefed Mr Kent of counsel to represent it at the
mediation. At this
stage no court proceeding had been commenced, as the claim
was progressing under the
Motor Accident Insurance Act 1994
or about 16 September 2003 the respondent was advised by Mr White that he had
been examined for suspected cancer and that secondary
cancers at various places
in his body had been located at the earliest on or about 1 September 2003, but
there were no medical reports
in existence dealing with Mr White’s cancer
or treatment (the cancer facts).
[5] The cancer facts were communicated to
Mr Mullins in a conference held by the respondent and Mr White with Mr Mullins
on or about
16 September 2003. One of the purposes of the conference was to
settle a schedule of damages. Mr Mullins prepared that schedule
of damages (the
schedule) which was based on the Evidex reports. The amount included in the
schedule for future economic loss was
$854,787.20, calculated as per the Evidex
report, but reduced for contingencies by 20 per cent. Mr Mullins expressed a
preliminary
view that the cancer facts had to be disclosed to Suncorp prior to
the mediation. Mr White instructed the respondent and Mr Mullins
that he did
not wish to disclose the cancer facts, unless he was legally obliged to do so,
and that he wished the mediation to proceed
as he wanted the matter resolved.
To the respondent’s knowledge, Mr Mullins provided the schedule on or
2003 to Mr Kent. As the respondent knew and intended, Mr
Kent and the representatives of Suncorp read the schedule.
[6] Mr Mullins
provided a written advice to the respondent dated 19 September 2003 on whether
the cancer facts should be disclosed
to Suncorp prior to the mediation and
concluded that:
White, the respondent and Mr Mullins were not legally obliged to disclose the
cancer facts to Suncorp within one month
of the discovery of the
(b) Mr White, the respondent and Mr Mullins could effectively conduct the
mediation provided that they did not positively mislead
Suncorp, Mr Kent
and his instructing solicitor as to Mr White’s life expectancy.
[7] While the written advice was comprehensive in many respects, it did not
address how the obligation of the respondent and Mr Mullins
not to positively
mislead Suncorp and its advisers reconciled with the information already
conveyed to Suncorp by the Evidex reports
and the schedule that there was no
impediment to Mr White’s life expectancy that did not arise from the motor
vehicle accident.
[8] The respondent considered the written advice of Mr
Mullins and wrongly accepted it as correct.
[9] On 19 September 2003, in
the presence of the respondent, Mr Mullins orally advised Mr White that he was
not legally obliged by
the MAIA or otherwise to disclose the cancer facts within
one month of discovering the diagnosis and that, although there were no
directly on the point and the law was not certain, Mr Mullins considered that
the law did not oblige Mr White to disclose the
cancer facts. Mr White
confirmed the instructions to the respondent and Mr Mullins that he did not wish
to disclose the cancer facts,
unless he was legally obliged to do so, and he
wished to proceed with the mediation and finalise his claim as soon as possible.
[10] Mr Mullins advised the respondent and Mr White that it was not
appropriate to make positive assertions during the course of the
mediation that
the facts were different to the facts that they knew to be true and they could
not make positive assertions that there
were no impediments to Mr White’s
life expectancy.
[11] During the course of the mediation, Mr Mullins
referred to and relied upon aspects of the schedule to support Mr White’s
claim for damages and represented that, immediately prior to the injury, Mr
White intended to continue working to normal retirement
age. The respondent
remained silent during the mediation, notwithstanding that Mr Mullins made those
representations.
[12] At the mediation Suncorp and Mr White agreed to
settle his claim for an amount that was substantially greater than would have
been the case had the respondent advised Suncorp of the cancer facts. After Mr
White died, Suncorp commenced an action to recover
the sum paid to Mr White and
that action was settled on confidential terms.
[13] The respondent has
admitted that it was his professional duty to reveal the cancer facts to Mr Kent
and to Suncorp, before any
settlement with Mr White was reached, and that he
breached his professional duty by failing to reveal those facts and proceeding
to negotiate the settlement of Mr White’s claim. (It was relevant that
paragraph 4.08 of the Solicitors Handbook prescribed
that a practitioner shall
not attempt to further the client’s case by unfair or dishonest means.)
Legislative framework
[14] Although the application against the
respondent was commenced under
Legal Profession Act 2007
the complaint had been made pursuant to the
Legal Profession Act 2004
of conduct that was committed prior to the commencement of that Act.
[15] It was not in issue on this application that the respondent’s
conduct is to be assessed by reference to the notions of
professional misconduct
and unprofessional conduct or practice that applied for the purpose of the
Queensland Law Society Act 1952:
see Legal Services Commissioner v Podmore
[2006] LPT 5 at paragraphs [4]-[9], Mullins at paragraph [31], footnote 20, and
Legal Services Commissioner v Scott [2009] LPT 7 at paragraphs
Decision in Mullins
[16] It had been argued on behalf of
Mr Mullins that his conduct in continuing to rely on the Evidex reports at the
mediation, without
disclosing the cancer facts, was not tantamount to some
representation that he was not aware of facts that could deleteriously impact
longevity. That was rejected. Reference was made at paragraph [29] in Mullins
that barristers could not approach the mediation
on the basis that honesty did
not apply and to rules 51 and 52 that had been adopted by the Bar Association of
Queensland at the
relevant time. Rule 51 provided that a barrister must not
knowingly make a false statement to the opponent in relation to the case
(including its compromise). That was supplemented by rule 52 that required a
barrister to correct any false statement unknowingly
made by the barrister to
the opponent, as soon as possible after the barrister became aware that the
statement was false.
[17] It was found by Byrne J in Mullins at paragraphs
[30] and [31] that Mr Mullins practised a fraudulent deception:
continuing to call the Evidex reports in aid as information supporting Mr
White’s claim after learning the cancer
facts and recognizing their
significance for the validity of the life-expectancy assumption, the respondent
intentionally deceived
Mr Kent and Suncorp representatives about the accuracy of
the assumption. He did so intending that Mr Kent and Suncorp would be influenced
by the discredited assumption to compromise the claim: which happened.
[31] The fraudulent deception the respondent practised on Mr Kent and
Suncorp involved such a substantial departure from the standard
of conduct to be
expected of legal practitioners of good repute and competency as to constitute
professional misconduct.”
(footnotes omitted)
[18] Byrne J ordered that Mr Mullins be publicly reprimanded, pay a penalty of
$20,000 and pay the applicant’s costs of that
application to be assessed.
Byrne J concluded that the misconduct of Mr Mullins warranted a public reprimand
to signify disapproval
of his misconduct and both the public reprimand and the
fine should deter similar misbehaviour: Mullins at paragraph
Significance of the respondent’s reliance on counsel’s
[19] It was common ground between the applicant and the respondent
that the respondent could not rely on Mr Mullins’ advice
as a defence to
the discipline application. The parties differed, however, on whether the
reliance on the advice by the respondent
was a circumstance that could be
favourably taken into account when characterising the respondent’s
[20] It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that there were
time pressures on the respondent between the disclosure of the cancer
Mr White on 16 September 2003 and the mediation scheduled for 19 September 2003.
The respondent was an experienced solicitor
in personal injuries litigation and
had briefed counsel who was also experienced in personal injuries litigation to
appear at the
mediation and to advise Mr White on whether he had to reveal the
cancer facts for the purpose of the mediation. The advice that
was prepared by
Mr Mullins was 67 paragraphs in length and was not available until the day of
the mediation. The respondent therefore
had limited time to read and scrutinise
the advice before the mediation which Mr White was keen to proceed with.
[21] It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, notwithstanding the
detail of the advice and the time exigency, the advice
was obviously deficient
in that it did not propose how to deal with the fact that Suncorp had already
been provided with the Evidex
reports (and the schedule) which were prepared on
a factual basis that had become untrue by the time of the mediation. As was
out in Mullins at paragraph [34], Mr Mullins had posed the wrong
questions in his advice. In addition, the very conduct which Mr
Mullins advised
against – not positively misleading Suncorp that there was no impediment
to Mr White’s life expectancy
in the future – would be committed by
not advising Suncorp of the cancer facts and thereby leaving Suncorp to believe
the facts relevant to life expectancy remained those set out in the Evidex
[22] At the time that the respondent considered Mr Mullins’
advice, he was faced with the ethical question of whether he should
silent at the mediation about the cancer facts, knowing that the information
that had been earlier provided to Suncorp had
been displaced by the cancer
facts. That ethical question directly concerned the honesty of the respondent
in dealing with his opponents
in the mediation.
[23] Whether it is
reasonable for a solicitor in the position of the respondent to rely on
counsel’s advice will be affected
by many factors. In the circumstances
of this mediation, the respondent was not a passive recipient of counsel’s
advice, but
brought his own legal knowledge, skill and experience to his
consideration of it. The observations made by Kirby J in the context
allegation of professional negligence in Boland v Yates Property Corporation Pty
[1999] HCA 64
(1999) 74 ALJR 209
, 240 [142] are apposite.
[24] Notwithstanding the
urgency that applied to the respondent’s consideration of Mr
Mullins’ advice, the advice was
patently flawed and that should have been
apparent to the respondent. The fact that the respondent acted on the advice is
an explanation
for why the respondent behaved the way he did at the mediation,
but it is not a factor that can favour the respondent in characterising
respondent’s conduct at the mediation.
Characterisation of
the respondent’s conduct
[25] In the circumstances in which this
mediation took place, the respondent by remaining silent at the mediation
practised a fraudulent
deception (analogous to that committed by Mr Mullins), in
that the respondent intentionally deceived Mr Kent and the other representatives
of Suncorp to believe that he knew of no facts likely to affect significantly Mr
White’s life expectancy. It was therefore
argued by Mr Bell QC on behalf
of the applicant that the respondent had committed an act of professional
misconduct by his role in
the mediation in the same way that it was found that
Mr Mullins’ conduct amounted to professional misconduct.
Douglas SC who appeared for the respondent on this application accepted that the
respondent’s conduct amounted to dishonesty,
but submitted that, in
context, the conduct was not of such seriousness as to characterise it as
professional misconduct, rather
than as unprofessional conduct or practice, and
that it should therefore be left for the Tribunal to characterise the conduct in
the circumstances.
[27] As the crux of the allegation against each of Mr
Mullins and the respondent was dishonesty, there should be no different
characterisation
of the respondent’s conduct from that of Mr Mullins in
the mediation. The conduct of the respondent amounted to professional
misconduct, as that concept is explained in Adamson v Queensland Law Society
Incorporated
[1990] 1 Qd R 498
Matters favourable to the
[28] The respondent was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme
Court of Queensland in 1991 and is the principal of a firm of solicitors.
have been no previous adverse disciplinary findings made against the respondent.
Apart from the conduct the subject of this
proceeding, the references from
fellow practitioners that were tendered on behalf of the respondent indicated
that the respondent
is perceived by his peers as a competent, diligent and
honest practitioner. He is highly regarded in his local community.
[29] The applicant fairly acknowledged that the conduct the subject of this
proceeding was an isolated incident, where the respondent
mistakenly relied on
counsel’s advice, and acted in the course of the mediation as a result of
an erroneous understanding of
his professional obligations.
respondent cooperated with the Legal Services Commission in relation to the
complaint against him arising out of the mediation
and this discipline
application. It was to the respondent’s credit that the issues that
remained outstanding at the hearing
of this application were confined.
[31] There is no doubt whatsoever that the respondent appreciates now why
his conduct at the mediation fell substantially short of
the standard expected
of a legal practitioner. It is highly unlikely that the respondent will ever
repeat such conduct.
Appropriate orders
[32] The applicant
submitted that there should be a public reprimand and a substantial penalty in
the order of $20,000 comparable
with the orders made in Mullins.
[33] It was
submitted on behalf of the respondent that a public reprimand was inapt, as the
publication of the reasons in Mullins
meant that the profession was well aware
of the events that resulted in this charge and the respondent’s
involvement in it.
In addition, as the reasons of the Tribunal in this matter
would be published on a publicly accessible website, the public reprimand
unnecessary and would take the matter no further.
[34] It was also submitted
on behalf of the respondent that it was Mr Mullins who was primarily running the
mediation. That submission
did not make sufficient allowance for the
independent responsibility that the respondent had throughout the mediation as
the solicitor
for Mr White, both in acting for Mr White and dealing with Suncorp
and its advisers.
[35] The disciplinary proceeding itself has been salutary
for the respondent. Apart from personal deterrence, however, the disciplinary
proceeding is also concerned with general deterrence and the need to protect the
public and maintain the reputation of the profession:
Legal Services
Commissioner v Madden (No 2)
[2008] QCA 301
at paragraph
. That justifies
a public reprimand of the respondent under s 456(2) of the Act. It would be an
odd result, where there was substantial
similarity in the professional
misconduct of Mr Mullins and the respondent in the same mediation, for only one
to be publicly reprimanded.
[36] The orders that should be made in respect
of the respondent’s professional misconduct are:
respondent is publicly reprimanded.
2. The respondent must pay a penalty of
3. The respondent must pay the applicant’s costs of the
application to be assessed.
