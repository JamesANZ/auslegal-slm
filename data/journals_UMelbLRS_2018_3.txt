TAXONOMY AND PUBLIC LAW
Jason N. E. Varuhas
Without good taxonomy and a vigorous taxonomic debate the law loses its
rational integrity ... some forms of thought and language
... make legal
taxonomy almost impossible and thus undermine the law’s rationality. All
forms of appeal to very broad ideas
tend to allow intuition to operate
unrestrained by an analysis anchored in authority. Every fundamentalist believes
his values make
for the public good, and the more zealous he is the less he will
be able to bear in mind the possibility that he may be mistaken
essential to come to the law armed with a belief in the fallibility of intuition
and a consequent aversion to all forms
of thought and expression which are no
more than vehicles of the gut reaction. Interpreters must consent to be
prisoners of their
own expertise.

NTRODUCTION
This paper takes the first steps towards developing a legal taxonomy of
public law fields, systematically identifying, mapping and
explaining different
categories of law that are typically identified with English public law.
Legal categorization is fundamental to full understanding of the law,
rigorous and complete legal analysis and coherent and rational
development. Yet legal taxonomy and debates over legal categorization have not
been a significant feature of public law scholarship,
in contrast to
contemporary private law scholarship. This paper begins by exploring the reasons
for this general absence of work
in legal categorization including that the very
notion of public law was long unknown to English law and is steeped in
theoretical
disagreement, that modern legal taxonomers have followed their Roman
forebears in focusing on private law, and contemporary trends
scholarship away from doctrinal work, and particularly doctrinal scholarship
that looks across different fields of law.
The paper goes on to argue that legal
categorization is of fundamental importance, especially in the light emergent
trends towards
open-ended balancing in public law adjudication. Legal
categorization enhances our understanding of the law, and facilitates right
answers to legal questions, maintenance of a rationally ordered system of law
and coherent legal development. Legal taxonomy promotes
formal rule of law
principles whereas approaches that eschew categorization, such as open- ended
case-by-case balancing, are likely
to radically undermine those principles and
imperil the coherence and stability of the legal system. Legal scholars are
well-placed to undertake analytical doctrinal work, including legal
taxonomy, and such work therefore offers
