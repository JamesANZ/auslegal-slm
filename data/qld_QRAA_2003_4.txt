BREACH OF RULE
APPEARANCES
: Mr William Dixon with the approval of the
Authority appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr Norm Torpey, Chairman
of Stewards, appeared on behalf of the Queensland Harness Racing
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an appeal by Mr Grant
Dixon against both the finding and penalty of the Queensland Harness Racing
Board Stewards that he was
in breach of Rule 168(1) of the Rules of Harness
Racing which provide:
“A person shall not before, during or after a
race drive in a manner which in the opinion of the stewards is careless,
intimidatory, foul or likely to endanger persons or
The penalty imposed by the Stewards was a period of 2
weeks suspension.
The matter relates to the Appellant’s driving
of Pepperjack during Race 6 at the Albion Park Raceway on Saturday 1 February
2003. An incident occurred during the race in the back straight during the
first lap where it appeared that the horse Heezable which
was driven by Mr Trent
Sullivan paced roughly and may have briefly broken stride. Mr Wilson was the
Steward stationed in the tower
on the turn of the back straight stated at the
inquiry that as the horses had negotiated the turn and straightened up the
had moved from a 3-wide to a 2-wide position and was pressing forward
and in his opinion trying to take a position down on the marker

At the hearing Mr William Dixon who is the father of the
Appellant emphasised that he realised the need to police this rule but felt
viewing the video and discussions with his son that there was no breach of the
Mr William Dixon’s submissions were to the effect that
there was enough room for his son to bring his horse down in front of
Sullivan’s horse and it was Mr Sullivan’s horse hanging out which
may have contributed to the incident.
After viewing of the race video
the Authority is of the opinion that notwithstanding that Mr Sullivan’s
horse did hang out the
Appellant was careless by allowing Pepperjack to shift
down which was the main contributing factor to the incident.
viewing of the film was reinforced by Mr Grant Dixon’s statements at the
Steward’s inquiry that his horse did not
move down the track as quickly as
he thought it would do so.
In the matter of penalty the Authority notes
that Mr Grant Dixon is a most experienced driver and his number of drives is
all drivers in Queensland. In view of the minor nature of the
incident it is considered that a more appropriate penalty would be
$300 and the Authority imposes that in lieu of the suspension.
