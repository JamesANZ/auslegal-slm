is an appeal against the decision of the respondent to give the appellant an
enforcement notice.
enforcement notice is dated 17 January 2024 (“the EN”). It alleges
that the appellant has committed a development
offence pursuant to
Planning Act 2016
(“the PA”) by contravening a
development approval.
appellant operates a quarry at 900 Sheppersons Lane, Kin Kin (“the
quarry”). It is located on the side of a hill.
Relevantly, on 27 May 2016
Her Honour Judge Bowskill QC made orders changing an existing approval for the
quarry, which included
a condition “The quarry is to be operated generally
in accordance with the Quarry Management Plan dated May 2016 (the Approved
Quarry Management Plan)”.
[4] The Approved
Quarry Management Plan (“the QMP”) is a very detailed document. In
para 1.5 it is stated:
Quarry operations will be carried out
generally in accordance with this QMP. Any changes or alterations will follow
the statutory
process for changes to approvals having regard to the extent of
the change proposed and in accordance with changes to legislation
applicable to
site activities from a planning, environmental and safety perspective from time
[5] The QMP
provided for an unspecified initial period of extraction from existing benches
at the base of the hill before ultimately
quarrying from the top of the hill
down. During this initial period the necessary haul roads and locations for
“fixed processing
plant” would be constructed. Relevantly para 2.2.2
The installation of a fixed crushing and screening plant
will occur when market conditions dictate and when the quarry has been opened
and haul road access plant building areas excavated and prepared.
[6] Internal
haul roads were specified in para 2.2.7 in, relevantly, the following terms:
The locations of the major haul roads linking the extractive areas
and the rock receiving bin of the fixed crushing and screening
plant are shown
on (...Figure 5 – Longer Term Site Layout) for the final stage of
development.
The haul roads have been designed for efficient and safe operation
particularly with respect to layout, geometry and type of construction.
[7] Para 2.2.10
stated that for “the initial quarry development period, estimated to run
to about 2020, a mobile crushing and
screening plant is expected to be
used.” In para 2.2.5 it is stated that the “long-term location for a
fixed crushing
and screening plant is situated on the slope on the eastern
portion of the site”, shown in Figure 5, and that over “the
short-medium term (0-7 years from the date of approval of this QMP), crushing
and screening at the quarry will be undertaken by portable
[8] There are
other places where the same types of statements appear. It is therefore
unsurprising that the appellant readily concedes
that the QMP approved a quarry
that will ultimately go from the top of the hill down the hill or a “top
down quarry”.
enable “progressive rehabilitation” to commence “once the
upper benches reach their final limits of extraction”
(QMP para 2.3.5).
The appellant contends it still has not yet started preparing for the top down
quarry operations envisaged by the
alleges that the appellant is operating fixed plant (principally a screening
plant) outside the area approved for fixed
crushing and screening plant shown in
Figure 5 of the QMP.
While it is
uncontentious that the plant in question is outside this area, it is contentious
as to whether it is located in breach
of the QMP.
respondent must establish that the appeal should be dismissed pursuant to
Planning and Environment Court Act 2016
(Qld) (“the
PECA”). In deciding the appeal the P&E Court is given a wide
discretion pursuant to
of the PECA, including confirming, changing and
setting aside the decision appealed against. In this regard, the EN required the
appellant to either make an application to enable lawful removal of the Plant,
or to relocate it to the Approved Fixed Plant Area
identified in Figure 5 of the
QMP by 7 March 2024 and either remove it or move it to this area within 6 weeks
of any such approval.
This time has now passed.
[11] During the
course of the hearing of the appeal the parties agreed on the following
questions for determination in deciding the
outcome of the appeal:
the Plant fixed within the meaning of the QMP?;
yes, is the Plant generally in accordance with the QMP?;
not, should the court exercise its discretion to set aside the EN?
[12] Given the
EN alleges the commission of a development offence by the appellant it is
uncontentious that the burden of establishing
that the appeal should be
dismissed is at the higher Briginshaw
As to the approach to be
taken to interpreting the QMP, I respectfully adopt the observations of Long SC
Noosa v Cordwell
The approach of the Applicant, in argument, was to correctly
seek to engage relevant principles of statutory interpretation as they
particularly applied to the construction of planning schemes, such as is set out
Zappala Family Co Pty Ltd v Brisbane City Council
. The same principles
which apply to statutory construction are applicable, with allowance for a
common-sense approach in reading
the documents in a practical way, as a whole
and as intending to achieve a balance between the outcomes.
[13] The hearing
of the appeal was conducted in the context of both parties calling evidence to
explain technical terms in the quarrying
industry, consistent with the
observation of Judge Cash QC in
Sunshine Coast Regional Council v D Agostini
Property Pty Ltd
extrinsic evidence of experts may be admissible to explain technical terms.
allegedly fixed plant the subject of the EN is part of a processing line that
includes components which are clearly
Those components the
subject of the EN are principally a screener which is a significant structure
approximately 12 metres high and
clad with metal and fibreglass sheeting and
bolted to a large concrete slab. It is connected via a conveyor to a feed bin
slab. This and other ancillary plant including concrete slabs
components sit and electrical connections to them are identified by the parties
in Ex. 8 as the plant in question (“the
Plant”). The appellant
asserts that the Plant is bolted to the slabs
to minimise unwarranted
vibration, comply with safety requirements and protect it from potential damage.
It is submitted that the
screener could be moved by a mobile crane in separate
modular components and that the feeder bin, being on skids, could be pulled
different location. It is therefore the primary submission of the appellant that
the Plant is not fixed, but mobile.
[15] The only
structural engineering expert who gave evidence was Mr McKenzie, called by the
respondent. His evidence was that the
only way to move the Plant would be to
disassemble it and reassemble it at another location, leaving the concrete slab
estimated that this would take a minimum of 7 days and that it would
be difficult to move any significant distance, even with a
large crane. He also
observed the absence of built-in lifting points on the Plant and an absence of
transportation or lifting certifications
in respect of it. He stated in his
experience, he would expect these features and the Plant itself to be smaller if
it was constructed
with an intention to relocate it. Ultimately, he expressed
the view that the Plant was a fixed piece of plant as it was bolted to
foundational slabs and not able to be moved from one location to another without
being disassembled and unfixed from the slabs.
[16] I found Mr
McKenzie to be a qualified and compelling expert witness. I accept his evidence
which is consistent with the evidence
of the quarrying expert called by the
respondent, Mr Reed, which I also accept. I find that the Plant is fixed
screening plant as
that term is used in the QMP.
[17] I now turn
to the question of whether the Plant is nonetheless generally in accordance
within the QMP. As a starting point, the
observations of Judge Williamson QC in
We Kando Pty Ltd v Western Downs Regional
instructive:
It has been recognised by courts for many years that a
condition of approval requiring development to be carried out generally in
acccodance with approved plans does allow for some deviation in the final form
of development. The need for flexibility in the comparison
between approved
plans and final plans of development requires no explanation. There is, however,
a limit to the extent of flexibility
that may be enjoyed in this context.
The extent of flexibility has been examined in many cases in this court. This
has occurred in the context of the ‘
generally in accordance
’ test. The authorities make it clear that the extent of
flexibility contemplated by the test will turn on the facts and circumstances
each case. The issue is one to be examined by reference to the town planning
consequences of the departure from the approved plans.
[18] As noted
above, the respondent called a quarrying expert, Mr Reed. The appellant also
called a quarrying expert, Mr Hill. He
emphasised that the term “fixed
crushing and screening plant” should refer to a group of equipment that
produces quarry
materials rather than a single piece of equipment. As noted
above, the Plant is part of a chain of equipment which includes clearly
vehicles. The appellant submits that the overall characterisation of the Plant
should therefore be mobile, not fixed. This
proposition is made harder to mount
given the evidence of Mr Reed, which I accept, that the Plant can also be
operated separately
from the mobile plant by being fed manually by a front
loader. I reject the characterisation proposition of the appellant that the
Plant is not fixed because it is used in conjunction with other mobile plant.
[19] I accept
the evidence of Mr Reed that mobile plant is commonly used for crushing and
screening in the early stages of developing
a quarry to provide essential
construction materials as well as allowing the developer to prepare sites
allocated for the installation
and operation of fixed plant. I find this
entirely consistent with the purpose evident in the QMP that ultimately the
quarry will
be established on a top down basis with fixed plant including
screening plant in the location in Figure 5,
where it integrates with
approved haul roads. I accept the evidence of Mr Reed that mobile plants are
wheel or track mounted, which
allows them to be relocated around blast events at
the quarry. I find that the Plant is not mobile plant.
[20] Ultimately,
Mr Reed expressed the view that the placing of the Plant in the current location
would not permit the quarry to develop
as a top down quarry in the manner
contemplated in the QMP and shown in Figure
[21] In his
affidavit filed on 7 August 2024 Mr Reed observed at para 106:
are a multitude of environmental, operational and cost related reasons why side
hill quarries are developed from top to bottom
(‘top down’) and not
from the bottom bench upwards. Top down development allows for the upper bench
to be developed to
its final boundary in the short rather than long term,
thereby allowing the progressive development of downhill benches in a well
managed fashion, that allows the quarry operators considerable
flexibility...
[22] Subsequently
he stated at para 107 that progressive site rehabilitation is only possible with
top-down quarry development. Under
cross-examination, Mr Hill acknowledged that
if the top-down methodology is not followed at the quarry, there are
consequences, and
in this regard he nominated a lack of bench widths and a
failure to progressively
rehabilitate.
As the town
planner who gave evidence on behalf of the appellant, Mr Buhmann, acknowledged,
the inability to progressively rehabilitate
as provided for in the QMP is a
significant adverse planning impact. Contrary to the submissions of the
appellant, this compromises
the intent of the QMP.
[23] Accordingly,
I find that there has been a material departure from the basis on which the
development approval was given which
has town planning consequences. I find
that, on the facts before me, the Plant is not generally in accordance with the
[24] Turning to
discretion, which was not uiltimately pushed by the appellant. There were not
demonstrated any notable adverse amenity
impacts as a consequence of the
location of the Plant. That is of limited relevance however. Mr Elkin, the
engineer called by the
appellant to give expert evidence in respect of noise
impacts, conceded under
cross-examination
assessment was very different to what would be performed for an acoustic report
accompanying a development application.
This is consistent with the observations
of Wilson SC DCJ in
Macquarie Leisure Operations Limited v Gold Coast City
Council & Ors
the differences between the assessment undertaken for a development application
and that which occurs in the course of a court
proceeding.
[25] The PA
provides for applications to change a development approval. That is a process,
which the appellant should undertake here.
The changes consequential on the
location of the Plant can then be properly assessed pursuant to the appropriate
legislative provisions
and assessment benchmarks. The respondent correctly
issued the EN. There is no discretionary reason to simply set it aside. It
however be changed to permit the making of a development application to
change the development approval.
[26] I make an
order as per the draft, which I initial and place with the file.
