persons adopted by the biological descendants in accordance with Ngadju
tradition and custom.
Adoption, under Ngadju tradition and custom,
refers to the situation where a child is 'grown up' by a relative or someone
a biological relationship, either because they have been 'gifted' to
them, or left in their care, as the biological parents are not
in a position to
care for them. This applies regardless of whether or not the child has been
formally adopted under the non-Aboriginal
legal system.
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
Ngadju People have been determined to be the holders of native title in relation
to land around Norseman. An applicant for native
title now seeks a consent
determination that the Ngadju People are the holders of native title in respect
of the townsite of Norseman
and its surrounds (
), subject to
certain qualifications. The Claim Area is approximately 6.5 square kilometres
persons comprising the applicant in these proceedings are jointly 'the
applicant':
Native Title Act 1993
(Cth). They may
deal with matters arising under the Act with respect to the application:
proposed description of native title holders for the consent determination is
the same as that for determinations that have previously
been made by this Court
as to native title held by the Ngadju People.
existence of a Ngadju society and the continuity of observance of laws and
customs and connection of the Ngadju people to the
land surrounding the Claim
Area has been the subject of previous decisions:
State of Western Australia
v Graham on behalf of the Ngadju People
[2013] FCAFC 143
[77]-[80] (Jagot, Barker and Perry JJ); and
Graham on behalf of the
Ngadju People (Ngadju Part B) v State of Western Australia
[2017] FCA 795.
The first of those decisions was an appeal decided after a contested hearing
before Marshall J. The consent determination now proposed
describes the
non-exclusive native title rights and interests of the Ngadju People in the
Claim Area in the same terms as those previous
native title rights of the Ngadju People that have previously been determined
are held in trust for the common law holders of
native title by the Ngadju
Native Title Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC (ICN 8297) (

Amplitel Pty Ltd and Resource Accommodation Management Pty Ltd.
authorities as to the nature and extent of the Court's power to make a
determination of native title by consent were recently
reviewed by O'Bryan J in
Oobagooma on behalf of the Big Springs Claim Group v State of Western
[2025] FCA 592
(2025) 309 FCR 515.
As his Honour there said at
... in exercising power under
[to make a consent determination], the
Court's principal focus is upon the agreement of the parties. In that context,
it is relevant
to consider whether the State, as the representative of the
interests of the community generally, has had independent and competent
representation and is acting in good faith and rationally. That does not
require the Court to embark on its own assessment
of the evidentiary basis for
the State's agreement, as such a requirement would undermine the purpose of the
power conferred ...
In a given case, the history of the proceeding, the legal
representation of the State, a statement of agreed facts and representations
made by the State to the Court, often jointly with the applicant, will be
sufficient to satisfy the Court that the State is acting
in good faith and
rationally in reaching agreement with the applicant ...
the present instance: (a) the fact that there have been past determinations in
respect of land surrounding the Claim Area; (b)
the support by all parties,
particularly the State of Western Australia; and (c) the involvement of
experienced legal practitioners,
together provide adequate support for the
making of the determination subject to the Court being satisfied that the
statutory requirements
evidence in support of the application takes the form of a short statement of
agreed facts, and an affidavit of a solicitor acting
for the applicant, namely
Mr Jeremy Brown.
the basis of the evidence before me, I am satisfied as to the following
(1) the applicant is authorised to bring the application;
(2) the notification period for the application ended on 26 April 2022;
(3) there has been no previous determination of native title over the Claim
(4) a duly convened meeting of claim group members held on 18 April 2025
authorised the signing of a minute of consent orders seeking
the proposed
determination;
(5) the meeting of claim group members also nominated and authorised NNTAC as
the prescribed body corporate to be the holder in trust
for the common law
holders of the native title that was proposed for determination;
(6) NNTAC has resolved to accept the nomination;
(7) NNTAC is properly registered on the Register of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Corporations;
(8) all parties to the application agree to the proposed determination;
(9) in considering whether to enter into the agreement all parties have had
competent independent legal representation, save for
Resource Accommodation
Management Pty Ltd;
(10) it is appropriate to rely upon the determinations that have been made as to
native title in respect of the surrounding area
as the basis for demonstrating
that the requirements of
Native Title Act
the Ngadju People in respect of the Claim Area;
(11) the Commonwealth Minister has not sought to intervene in the proceedings
and therefore is not a necessary party; and
(12) the terms of the proposed determination accord with the requirements of
Native Title Act
those circumstances, I am satisfied that the making of the proposed consent
determination is within the power of the Court and
that it appears appropriate,
on the basis of the consent of the parties, for the determination to be made
pursuant to
Native Title Act
is one matter that requires some elaboration. In
, O'Bryan J
emphasised the importance of paying close regard to the statutory language of
when it defines native title and native title rights and interests
for the purposes of the
Native Title Act
: at [102].
In particular, as his Honour stated at [103], the statutory language points
to two inquiries, namely:
... first, identification of the traditional laws and customs and the
identification of the rights and interests possessed under
those traditional
laws and customs; and, second, identifying the connection with land or waters by
those laws and customs ...
his Honour then observed, departure from the statutory language in submissions
advanced to support consent determinations should
be closely considered to
ensure that it does not indicate a failure to have regard to the issues that the
legislation requires.
the present case, there were two such departures. First, the joint submissions
included the following submission under the heading
'Connection':
Ngadju Part A was the subject of a contested hearing before the Federal Court,
and an appeal to the Full Court. The Full Court accepted
Marshall J's finding
that the Ngadju people had a connection to the entirety of the Ngadju Part A
claim area in accordance with traditional
laws and customs.
(footnote omitted)
agreed facts included the following:
As the Full Court accepted Marshall J's finding that there was evidence of a
Ngadju society which exists today and continues to observe
traditional laws and
customs, and that the Ngadju people had and have a connection to the entirety of
the claim area in accordance
with those traditional laws and customs, it is
agreed that the finding applies to the [Claim Area], which is encompassed by the
determined area.
statutory language requires the requisite connection with the land to be 'by'
the traditional laws acknowledged and traditional
customs observed. The
connection is required to arise from the acknowledgement and observance rather
than to be actions that are
'in accordance with' those traditional laws and
Notwithstanding
this use of language, it is clear that in the present case, the consent rests
substantially upon the determination
after a contested hearing of native title
in the same terms for the same people for a very substantial area surrounding
Area. The previous determinations were to the effect that the
statutory language had been satisfied to the extent of native title
interests of
the kind now sought to be the subject of determination for the Claim Area in
respect of a group of people defined in
the same way.
those circumstances, I am satisfied that the kind of connection required by the
legislation has been sufficiently demonstrated.
those reasons I will make the orders sought.
