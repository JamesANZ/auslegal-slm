REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
BESANKO CJ:
are reasons for an order I made on 22 June 2023.
this proceeding in the Court, Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac) is claiming
to be the mortgagee of land at 10 Berrys Lane (also
known as Portion 145G
Berrys Lane), Norfolk Island and it seeks orders for the possession of the land
of which the defendant, Mr
Grant Summerscales, is said to be the registered
proprietor. Westpac seeks the relief on the ground that Mr Summerscales has
in the payment of monies secured by the mortgage over the land and
failed to comply with the default notice served upon him.
commenced the proceeding by way of Originating claim and Statement of claim
filed on 15 November 2022. Mr Summerscales filed
a notice of intention to
respond, application in a proceeding, interlocutory process and affidavit on 1
his affidavit affirmed on 31 May 2023, and during the course of the first case
management hearing before me on 22 June 2023, Mr
Summerscales raised an issue
that the documents served on him do not bear a seal of the Supreme Court of
Norfolk Island. At the
conclusion of the first case management hearing I made
the following order:
of an abundance of caution and pursuant to all enabling powers, including
Court Procedures Rules 2006
(ACT) and section 29 of the
Court Act 1960
(NI), and subject to the Registrar sealing and signing such
documents filed in the Court as are required to be sealed and signed
by the said
Rules, and the provision of such documents to each party, I dispense with the
requirements of the said Rules in relation
thereto and should there be a defect
or irregularity, I declare the proceeding valid as I am satisfied there is no
substantial injustice
by reason of such defect or irregularity.
virtue of s 19(4) of the
Supreme Court Act 1960
(NI) (the Act), the
Court Procedures Rules 2006
(ACT) (the Rules) apply to this matter.
of those Rules provides that the Registrar must seal an originating process.
What constitutes a seal is not defined in the Rules
(see also r 6304). Section
11(1) of the Act sets out that the Court shall have a Seal of the Court for
sealing writs and other instruments
or documents issued out of the Court and
required to be sealed.
Originating claim, together with all other documents filed in the proceeding up
to 22 June 2023 have been received and have been
stamped by the Court on
the top right hand corner of the first page. The stamp is a rectangular box
containing the word “FILED”,
the date of filing and the words
“SUPREME COURT NORFOLK ISLAND”.
proceed on the basis that the Originating claim needed to be sealed because it
is an originating process. There are other documents
that must be sealed, for
example, a notice of intention to respond or a defence. It is for the Registry
to determine, having regard
to the Act and Rules, how documents are to be
received and marked and to act accordingly.
29 of the Act provides:
Proceedings not invalidated by formal defects
(1) Proceedings in the Supreme Court shall not be invalidated by any formal
defect or by any irregularity, unless the Court is of
the opinion that
substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the
injustice cannot be remedied by
an order of the Court.
(2) The Court or a Judge may make an order declaring that any proceeding is
valid notwithstanding any defect or irregularity.
6 of the Rules provides that:
(1) The court may, by order, dispense with the application of a provision of
these rules to a particular proceeding, before or after
the provision applies
and on any conditions it considers appropriate.
seemed to me that any failure to seal or otherwise comply with the Rules had, in
the circumstances, caused no injustice. The documents
were documents of the
parties and they were received and marked by the Court. The question then was
as to the terms of the order.
Clearly, there was no need to make an order as to
how documents lodged in the future were to be dealt with. That is governed by
the Act and Rules. As to the documents filed before the order was made, and in
an attempt to bring matters as close to how they
should have been, I included in
the order a requirement that existing documents on the Court file should be
sealed and signed to
the extent required by the Rules and copies provided to the
parties. Whether such a requirement is necessary in all cases may be
but that is not of present
I certify that the preceding eleven (11)
numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment of the
Honourable Chief Justice
