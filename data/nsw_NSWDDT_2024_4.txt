Introduction
judgment concerns a Notice of Motion seeking verified discovery of classes of
documents in a silicosis case.
a Further Amended Statement of Claim filed on 18 April 2023 the plaintiff
alleges that he was exposed to silica, granite and quartz
dust while working in
the building industry as follows:
(1) From 1994 to 1999 as an employee of Stone-Tech (Holdings) Pty Ltd
(Stone-Tech).
(2) From 17 August 2000 to 1 April 2008 while employed by Stone-Tech (Holdings)
Australia Pty Ltd, known as Joys (NSW) Pty Ltd (Joys).
(3) From 1 April 2008 to 2019 as a self-employed stonemason.
and Joys have been deregistered. The first defendant Workers Compensation
Nominal Insurer is sued as the party liable to
indemnify Stone-Tech and Joys for
negligence.
the course of his self-employment between 2008 and 2019, Mr Saroo alleges that
he worked with stone products containing silica
and quartz which were
manufactured or supplied or imported or distributed by the second, third,
fourth, seventh, eighth, ninth and
tenth defendants.
fifth and sixth defendants are no longer involved in the proceedings.
Saroo alleges that as a result of inhaling silica dust during the periods of
employment and self-employment, he has developed silicosis
and has suffered
injury, loss and damage. Mr Saroo alleges that his condition was caused by the
negligence of Stone-Tech, Joys and
the other defendants.
a Notice of Motion filed on 15 April 2024 Mr Saroo seeks orders for verified
discovery of classes of documents against the third
defendant (Caesarstone
Australia), the fourth defendant (WK Marble), the seventh defendant (Smartstone
Australia), the eighth defendant
(Halifax Vogel) and the tenth defendant
(Laminex Group).
Australia and Halifax Vogel consent to orders for the verified discovery of
classes of documents listed in MFI 1, subject
to requiring until 30 June 2024 to
provide verified discovery, as opposed to the earlier date proposed in the
Notice of Motion. As
indicated to the parties during oral submissions, I will
make an order for verified discovery against Smartstone Australia and Halifax
Vogel, and allow them until 30 June 2024 to provide verified discovery.
Caesarstone
Australia, WK Marble and Laminex Group agree to provide verified discovery of
some of the classes of documents but oppose
other classes. That dispute is the
subject of this judgment.
The Issues on the Pleadings

(1) Caesarstone Australia admits that it supplied Stone-Tech and Joys with
engineered stone (par 7 of the Defence).
(2) Caesarstone Australia does not admit that it supplied products that the
plaintiff worked with during his period of self-employment
(par 7 of the
(3) Caesarstone Australia does not admit that during the period of
self-employment the plaintiff was exposed to silica dust generated
Caesarstone Australia products (par 6 of the Defence).

8 of the Defence).
(2) WK Marble denies the allegation of negligence (par 12 of the Defence).
(3) Contributory negligence (par 14 of the Defence).
Laminex Group

(1) Laminex Group does not admit the allegations of negligence, breach of
contractual duty and breach of statutory duty (pars 6 and
7 of the Defence).
(2) Laminex Group denies the allegation of negligence (par 9 of the Defence).
(3) Contributory negligence (par 11 of the Defence).
Discovery Provisions
of documents in the Dust Diseases Tribunal is governed by r 4 of the
Diseases Tribunal Rules 2019
(NSW) (DDT Rules).
provides that
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005
(NSW) (UCPR) applies in the Tribunal,
subject to adaptations specified in r 4 of the DDT Rules.
reference is made below to the terms of a rule in the UCPR, that rule will be
reproduced incorporating the adaptations required
by r 4 of the DDT Rules.
21.1 of the UCPR deals with definitions for the purposes of Div 1 of Part 21,
which concerns discovery and inspection of documents.
Rule 21.1(2) provides as
“(2) For the purposes of this Division, a document or matter is to be
taken to be relevant to a fact in issue if it could,
or contains material that
could, rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of
that fact (otherwise than
by relating solely to the credibility of a witness),
regardless of whether the document or matter would be admissible in
21.2 of the UCPR provides as follows:
“(1) The court may order that party B must give discovery to party A
(a) documents within a class or classes specified in the order, or
(b) one or more samples (selected in such manner as the court may specify) of
documents within such a class.
(2) A class of documents must not be specified in more general terms than the
court considers to be justified in the circumstances.
(3) Subject to subrule (2), a class of documents may be specified—
(a) by relevance to one or more facts in issue, or
(b) by description of the nature of the documents and the period within which
they were brought into existence, or
(c) in such other manner as the court considers appropriate in the
circumstances.
(4) An order for discovery may not be made in respect of a document unless the
document is relevant to a fact in issue.”
basis for an order for discovery, is that discovery is necessary in the
interests of a fair trial:
Percy v General Motors-Holden’s Pty Ltd
[1975] 1 NSWLR 289.
can be seen that r 21.2(3)(a) requires the court to take into account the
definition of “relevant to a fact in issue”
contained in r
21.3 of the UCPR, as amended by r 4 of the DDT Rules, is as follows:
“(1) Party B must comply with an order for discovery by serving on party A
a list of documents that deals with all of the documents
(other than excluded
documents) referred to in the order.
(2) The list of documents—
(a) must be divided into two parts—
(i) Part 1 relating to documents in the possession of party B, and
(ii) Part 2 relating to documents that are not, but that at any time have been,
in the possession of party B, and
(b) must include a brief description (by reference to nature and date or period)
of each document or group of documents and, in the
case of a group, the number
of documents in that group, and
(c) must specify, against the description of each document or group in Part 2 of
the list of documents, the person (if any) who party
B believes to be in
possession of the document or group of documents, and
(d) must identify any document that is claimed to be a privileged document, and
specify the circumstances under which the privilege
is claimed to arise.
(3) Party B must comply with the requirements of subrule (1)—
(a) within 28 days after an order for discovery is made, or
(b) within such other period (whether more or less than 28 days) as the order
may specify.”
21.4 of the UCPR, as amended by r 4 of the DDT Rules, is as follows:
“(1) The list of documents must be accompanied by—
(a) a supporting affidavit, and
(b) if party B has a solicitor, by a solicitor’s certificate of advice.
See rule 35.3 as to who may make such an affidavit.
(2) The affidavit referred to in subrule (1)(a) must state that the
(a) has made reasonable inquiries as to the documents referred to in the order,
(b) believes that there are no documents (other than excluded documents) falling
within any of the classes specified in the order
that are, or that at any time
have been, in the possession of party B (other than those referred to in Part 1
or 2 of the list of
documents), and
(c) believes that the documents in Part 1 of the list of documents are within
the possession of party B, and
(d) believes that the documents in Part 2 of the list of documents are within
the possession of the persons (if any) respectively
specified in that Part,
(e) as to any document in Part 2 of the list of documents in respect of which no
such person is specified, has no belief as to whose
possession the document is
and must state, in respect of any document that is claimed to be a privileged
document, the facts relied on as establishing the existence
of the privilege.
(3) The solicitor’s certificate of advice referred to in subrule (1)(b)
must state that the solicitor—
(a) has advised party B as to the obligations arising under an order for
discovery (and if party B is a corporation, which officers
of party B have been
so advised), and
(b) is not aware of any documents within any of the classes specified in the
order (other than excluded documents) that are, or that
within the last 6 months
before the commencement of the proceedings have been, in the possession of party
B (other than those referred
to in Part 1 or 2 of the list of documents).”
persons who may make an affidavit are set out in UCPR r 35.3. In the case of a
corporation, the affidavit must be made “by
a member or officer of the
corporation”.
affidavit verifying a list of documents is conclusive and must be accepted by
the parties seeking discovery as being sufficient
Birmingham v
[1913] UKLawRpKQB 128
[1913] 3 KB 850
at 855. Generally, cross-examination on the affidavit
verifying is not permitted.
addition to the affidavit verifying the list, there must be a solicitor’s
certificate of advice which states the matters
required by r 21.4(3).
because proceedings in the Tribunal are personal injury claims, the Tribunal
must take into account r 21.8 of the UCPR. As
modified by r 4 of the DDT Rules,
r 21.8 is as follows:
“In any proceedings on a common law claim—
(a) for damages arising out of the death of, or bodily injury to, any person,
(b) for contribution in respect of damages so arising,
an order for discovery may not be made in relation to any document unless the
order is necessary to ensure that the outstanding issues
in dispute are properly
Discovery Principles
relevant legal principles were summarised by Bellew J in
Hunter v New England
Local Health District v Munters Pty Ltd
[2018] NSWSC 788
“(1) Discovery cannot be ordered other than in respect of
documents that are relevant to a fact in issue. It is therefore
necessary to
demonstrate a connection between the class of documents of which discovery is
sought, and a fact or facts in issue.
Where a class is specified in some manner
other than by relevance to a fact in issue, it must be apparent that the class
so described
will capture only documents that are so relevant:
Energy Pty Ltd v Lloyd Energy Systems Pty Ltd
[2014] NSWSC 1326
(2) The facts in issue will be primarily identified by an
examination of the pleadings:
Schlam v WA Trustee Executor & Agency Co
[1964] WAR 178
Mulley v Manifold
(1959) 103 CLR 341
(3) For the purposes of discovery, a document need not be
admissible, and need not be directly probative of the existence of the
issue, to be relevant. It follows that in a general sense, the test for
discovery under the rule is relatively wide:
Hutchinson v Glover
[1875] UKLawRpKQB 94
(4) The relevance of a document to a fact in issue is to be
determined by its capacity to rationally affect the assessment of
probability of the existence of the contentious fact:
Compagnie Financiere et
Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co
[1883] UKLawRpKQB 95
(1882) 52 LJQB 181
(5) Discovery will be ordered only where it is reasonably
required for the fair disposition of the proceedings, and where its legitimate
purposes include to obtain evidence and to avoid surprise: In the matter of
Felan’s Fisheries Pty Ltd
[2017] NSWSC 1262
(6) Discovery involves an “inroad”, in the
interests of justice, upon the right of the individual to keep his own documents
to himself:
Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic
Management and Marketing Pty Ltd
(2013) 250 CLR 303
[2013] HCA 46
Harman v Home Department State Secretary
[1983] 1 AC 280
[1982] 2 WLR
(7) The discretion conferred by r 21.2 must be exercised having
regard to the provisions of
Civil Procedure Act 2005
(NSW). In this regard, case management principles become relevant, although
they are not necessarily determinative:
Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty
(8) Although proper compliance with a party’s obligations
of discovery is an important and necessary part of modern litigation,
necessarily has the capacity under the rules to limit discovery, or control the
process of giving discovery, so that it
does not become unduly onerous:
Ange v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd
[2010] NSWSC 1200
(9) There is no entitlement to “chain of enquiry”
discovery. If the process of discovery is abusive, or compliance
with an order
too onerous, the court can (and should) control it:
Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney
Pty Limited
[2011] NSWCA 264.
Counsel for Caesarstone Australia also referred to the following
principles:
(1) The scope of discovery may be limited, to avoid the potential for discovery
to give rise to oppressive and disproportionate costs
and to impede the
“overriding purpose” in the
Civil Procedure Act 2005
Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd
[2011] NSWCA 264.
(2) Courts should be alert to the cost, and associated delay and complexity,
associated with extensive discovery:
Commonwealth Bank of Australia v
[2016] NWSC 710 at [31]-[34].
(3) The court may relieve a party from giving discovery where the extent of
discovery would be oppressive:
Alexander v Fitzpatrick
[1981] Qd R 359.
applicability of the above principles was not in dispute between the parties.
One dispute did arise during oral submissions. Counsel
for the plaintiff made
the following submission (Tcpt 12/25-32):
“Again, I make the point that it is only relevant documents that have to
be listed, not irrelevant documents. But the plaintiff
has no way of knowing,
your Honour. The only person that can make that call is the solicitor for
Caesarstone, and that is the usual
practice in discovery. The solicitor has to
provide an affidavit, has to certify that the process has been done correctly,
relevant documents only have been produced, have been disclosed and
discovered. That is inherent in the nature of the discovery process.
to a very large extent, on the solicitor for the defendant ensuring and
verifying that it has been done correctly. The
plaintiff has no way of
delineating what is relevant and what is not.”
Counsel for Caesarstone Australia (whose submission was adopted by all other
active defendants) submitted as follows (Tcpt
“... we take real issue with the task, as it has been described by my
learned friend, a party under an order for discovery
by a Court, subject to
categories of discovery, does not have any discretion as to which documents
within that category it produces,
and it cannot embark upon an exercise of
forensic judgment as to whether or not it considers a particular document that
falls within
the category is relevant to the proceedings or a fact in issue in
the proceedings to decide whether or not to produce it. That exercise
determining relevance to a fact in issue in proceedings either has to be done by
agreement between the parties, or pursuant to
an order for general discovery,
which is not the case here, or in a disputed context in relation to determining
the outline of the
particular category.” (Emphasis added)
accept the submission made by Senior Counsel for Caesarstone Australia. It is
for the party seeking discovery to draft classes of
documents so that each class
is confined to documents which are relevant to the proceedings or a fact in
issue in the proceedings.
It is not a proper approach to discovery for classes
to be drafted in a very wide fashion, and then expect the solicitor for the
party providing discovery to exercise his or her judgment to determine whether
or not documents within a very broad class are relevant
to a narrower issue
disclosed on the pleadings. As a matter of practice, most parties required to
provide verified discovery would
ask their lawyer for advice as to which
documents fall within a specified class of documents. In that sense the
solicitor for the
party providing discovery does have to exercise judgment as to
whether a document falls in a class or not. However, the solicitor
for a party
providing discovery should not be called upon to form an opinion as to whether
documents specified in a class which is
too widely drawn are somehow relevant to
an issue on the pleadings.
Disputed Classes of Documents
plaintiff requested all defendants to discover documents in 12 nominated
classes. Caesarstone Australia argued that it should
not be obliged to provide
verified discovery of Classes 4, 9, 10 and 12. WK Marble argued that it should
not be obliged to provide
verified discovery of Classes 6, 9 and 12. Laminex
Group argued that it should not be obliged to provide verified discovery of
4, 9 and 12.
Class 4: Prior Claims or
Proceedings
4 of documents is in the following terms:
“All documents, wherever created and located, discovered by the ...
defendant in any claims and/or similar proceedings initiated
against it in
relation to exposure RCSD [Respirable Crystalline Silica Dust] in this
September 2019.” (Emphasis added)
for the plaintiff submitted (MFI 2, par 9) that documents discovered by a
defendant in other proceedings or claims in relation
to exposure to RCSD are
relevant to the issue of the defendant’s knowledge in relation to the risk
of injury to stonemasons
using its products.
Caesarstone
Australia submitted (MFI 5, par 5) that the description of documents does not
establish why they would be relevant to
any facts in issue in the proceedings,
and in any event the description is unduly broad and oppressive.
Group submitted (MFI 4, par 9) that the plaintiff had sought, and Laminex Group
did not oppose, discovery of all documents
relating to the knowledge of Laminex
Group to the risk of injury to stonemasons from exposure to RCSD prior to 1
September 2019 (Class
1). In addition, the plaintiff had also sought in Classes
2, 3, 7 and 8, documentation which related to the risk of injury to stonemasons
exposed to RCSD. Laminex Group did not oppose discovery of documents in Classes
1, 2, 3, 7 and 8.
ordinary litigation, documents discovered in previous proceedings would not
normally be made available to a party conducting current
proceedings. However,
proceedings for damages in the Dust Diseases Tribunal are not ordinary
litigation. There are two provisions
Dust Diseases Tribunal Act
(NSW) (DDT Act) which mean that evidence or documents from previous
proceedings can be tendered in current proceedings.
25(3) of the DDT Act provides as follows:
“(3) Historical evidence and general medical evidence concerning dust
exposure and dust diseases which has been admitted in
any proceedings before the
Tribunal may, with the leave of the Tribunal, be received as evidence in any
other proceedings before
the Tribunal, whether or not the proceedings are
between the same parties.”
25A of the DDT Act deals with “material already obtained” and
provides as follows:
“(1) Material obtained for the purposes of proceedings before the Tribunal
by discovery or interrogatories may:
(a) with the leave of the Tribunal, and
(b) with the consent of:
(i) subject to subparagraph (ii), the party who originally obtained the material
or the party’s Australian legal practitioner,
(ii) another person prescribed by the rules,
be used in other proceedings before the Tribunal, whether or not the proceedings
are between the same parties.
(2) The rules may provide that subsection (1) does not apply in specified kinds
of proceedings or in specified circumstances.”
bulk of litigation in the Dust Diseases Tribunal since its inception in 1989 has
concerned asbestos-related diseases. Most practitioners
in the Tribunal keep a
vast archive of documents and material tendered or made available in previous
cases. This material is then
deployed in current proceedings. Litigation arising
out of silicosis contracted from working with engineered stone is in its infancy
in the Tribunal. In my view it is appropriate for Mr Saroo to have access to
documents discovered in any previous proceedings or
claims involving Caesarstone
Australia or Laminex Group, as such material might bear upon issues in Mr
Saroo’s case. It is
appropriate for material from previous proceedings to
be made available to the solicitors for Mr Saroo, in order to “ensure
the outstanding matters in the dispute are properly tried”, see r 21.8
UCPR as modified by r 4 of the DDT Rules.
Storm Limited (subject to a deed of company arrangement) ACN 064 270
[2016] NSWSC 306
, Brereton J said at [17]:
“In that context, it is necessary to remember the purposes of discovery.
While it is a common use of discovery to obtain evidence
of Party B’s
knowledge or conduct, that is far from its sole use or purpose. The purposes of
discovery include not only obtaining
relevant evidence, but also reducing
surprise and promoting fairness by putting parties in an equal position at
trial, so that the
parties are ‘
playing with all the cards face up on
. Discovery has the consequence that Party B cannot adduce
documentary evidence at trial which takes Party A by surprise. Thus, simply
ascertaining what documents relevant to a fact in issue are in the possession of
Party B and may be deployed at trial by that party,
or may aid Party
A’s case or harm Party B’s case, is a relevant and proper purpose of
discovery. It is a means of a party
ascertaining what the other party has in its
hand, and thereby avoiding surprise.”
litigation is one of the first engineered stone cases which is approaching the
stage of a trial in this Tribunal. In a case
where the plaintiff was a worker
who may have appreciated little or nothing about the dangers of the inhalation
of silica dust, and
the defendants knew or ought to have known of the dangers,
there is good reason to require all cards to be face up on the table.
propose to make an order for verified discovery of Class 4 documents against
Caesarstone Australia and Laminex Group. As a matter
of common sense and
practicality, such discovery should be provided, initially, by the solicitors
for each defendant providing to
the solicitors for Mr Saroo a copy of any list
of documents (verified or unverified) discovered in prior proceedings. The
for Mr Saroo could then indicate which, if any, of those documents
they wish to inspect. By this means there would not be undue expense
the defendants, as they could initially provide the list of documents from
previous claims or proceedings, and would only
be required to produce the
documents for inspection upon request by the solicitors for Mr Saroo.
a letter dated 5 April 2024 (PX 1, p 107) the solicitors for Caesarstone
Australia say that their client “has provided disclosure
consistent with the disclosure it has provided in litigation that it has been
involved in in Australia since the litigation
first commenced”. The orders
which I will make will achieve the same aim, with the added formality of
requiring the defendant
to give verified discovery, not just disclosure.
Group also submitted that Class 4 is far too wide and does not relate to
documents relevant to a fact in issue in the proceedings.
Laminex Group
submitted (MFI 4, par 11) that such a wide class of documents captures many
documents from other claims or litigation,
which are not relevant to the
asserted issue of the knowledge of the defendant. It was submitted that, for
example, Class 4 is wide
enough to require discovery of medical records from any
previous claimants. I reject that submission. What Class 4 seeks is not all
documents from previous litigation, but documents discovered by the defendant in
previous litigation.
will order verified discovery of Class 4 documents against Caesarstone Australia
and Laminex Group.
Class 6: Annual Reports
discovery of documents in Class 6 is opposed only by WK Marble. Counsel for the
plaintiff submitted (MFI 2, par 20) that this
class of documents is relevant to
the capacity of WK Marble to provide warnings with respect to its products and
relevant to the
resources which WK Marble had at its disposal to provide such
for WK Marble submitted (MFI 3, pars 18-21) as follows:
(1) The Annual Reports will contain information that is not remotely relevant to
any fact in issue in the proceedings.
(2) There is no pleading which puts in issue the capacity of WK Marble to
provide warnings.
(3) There is no reason to expect that the Annual Reports will materially assist
the plaintiff on the purported issue of capacity
or resources to provide
(4) An order for the discovery of this class of documents is not consistent with
the just, quick and cheap determination of the real
issues in the proceedings.
for WK Marble also pointed out that in its Defence WK Marble had specifically
pleaded the warnings that it did provide.
Caltex Refineries (Qld) v Stavar
[2009] NSWCA 258
(2009) 75 NSWLR 649
of Appeal set out a non-exhaustive list of features to be considered in
determining whether a duty of care existed and
in identifying the scope and
content of such a duty. One of those features was “the degree and nature
of control able to be
exercised by the defendant to avoid harm”.
Marble pleads that it did provide warnings. The plaintiff may wish to argue that
WK Marble should have done more by way of warnings.
If WK Marble had the
resources available financially to provide better warnings, then that is a fact
relevant to the scope and content
of its duty of care and whether there had been
a breach of that duty.
do not regard it as onerous or vexatious for WK Marble to be required to provide
verified discovery of its Annual Reports. Presumably
they will establish the
size and nature of the operation conducted by WK Marble, at least in financial
terms. I find that such documents
would be relevant to a fact in issue in the
case. I will order WK Marble to provide verified discovery of the documents in
Class 9: Marketing and Promotional Expenditure
9 of the documents sought is as follows:
“All documents, wherever created and located, relating to the marketing
and promotional expenditure of the... defendant in
relation to engineered stone
products sold in the Australian market prior to 1 September 2019.”
for the plaintiff made it plain in oral submissions that one should read this
Class with a comma after the word “marketing”,
so that the documents
sought related either to marketing, or to promotional expenditure. It was not
intended to confine marketing
to marketing expenditure.
for the plaintiff submitted (MFI 2, par 11) that this class of documents is
relevant to the issue of knowledge of the dangers
associated with the use of the
defendant’s products, the methods and means which the defendant used in
promotion of the products,
and the means which the defendant had at its disposal
to communicate a different message to stonemasons concerning the dangers of
for Caesarstone Australia submitted (MFI 5, par 8) that such an onerous search
could not be justified. It was submitted that
a more targeted approach to
determining marketing budget, such as from company reports, should be
for WK Marble submitted (MFI 3, pars 23-28) as follows:
(1) This class does not relate to any fact in issue in the proceedings.
(2) The class is exceedingly broad, requiring 19 years worth of documents
relating to marketing and expenditure.
(3) The affidavit of Mr Norman shows that records prior to 2006 are not in
electronic form and Mr Norman has no knowledge of the
whereabouts of any
documentation, if it exists.
(4) The records from 2006 to 2019 contain little information on marketing and
expenditure and do not differentiate between different
product lines in respect
of the allocation of expenditure.
(5) It is difficult to ascertain how documents relating to marketing and
promotional expenditure are relevant to the defendant’s
knowledge of the
dangers of RCSD and the measures available to address such dangers. These issues
have been specifically addressed
by classes of documents which are not in
for Laminex Group submitted (MFI 4, pars 19 and 20) that the material sought has
no relevance to any knowledge of Laminex
Group as to the dangers of RCSD and the
means by which those dangers could have been reduced. Further, uncontested
classes of documents
bear directly upon that issue.
the face of it, it is difficult to see why Class 9 documents are relevant to a
fact in issue in the case. The plaintiff’s
case is not that he was induced
to purchase products by some representations, marketing or promotion. His case
is that he was a stonemason
who worked with these products as part of his trade.
the submission by counsel for the plaintiff that such documents go
“directly” to the issue of knowledge of the
dangers associated with
engineered stone is, with respect, hard to fathom, when many other classes of
documents (the discovery of
which is not opposed) do go directly to this
find that the documents described in Class 9 are not relevant to a fact in issue
and it has not been demonstrated that such documents
could contain material that
could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a
relevant fact in issue.
decline to order the defendants to provide verified discovery of Class 9
Class 10: Composition of Engineered Stone
Caesarstone
Australia opposes an order for verified discovery of the documents in Class 10
which is as follows:
“All documents, wherever created and located, relating to the inception,
creation, formulation, mixture, specifications, and
production/manufacture of
the fourth defendant’s engineered stone products prior to 1 September
for the plaintiff submitted (MFI 2, par 13) that this class is relevant to the
production by Caesarstone Australia of products
containing silica, the
plaintiff’s exposure to silica from its products, knowledge of the
foreseeable risk of injury to stonemasons,
capacity to provide warnings, and
whether Caesarstone Australia discharged its duty of care to stonemasons exposed
to dust from engineered
stone products.
Counsel for Caesarstone Australia submitted (MFI 5) that Caesarstone Australia
admitted that its products contained silica
and otherwise contended that
specifications and methods of manufacture were not an issue in these
proceedings. It was also submitted
that Class 10 was unnecessary as Caesarstone
Australia had already produced material safety data sheets for the products.
referred to in the Defence.
being a silicosis case, relevant issues will include whether there was exposure
to RCSD, the level of silica in each product
used by the plaintiff, and the
effects of a particular defendant’s RCSD upon the plaintiff. Silicosis is
a divisible disease,
and if the plaintiff proves exposure, it will be necessary
to divide his damages between defendants having regard to, inter alia,
length of time to which he was exposed to a particular defendant’s dust,
and the level of silica dust in each product.
that background, I find that the documents in Class 10 are relevant to facts in
issue in the case. It is not to the point
that Caesarstone Australia has already
produced documents concerning the specifications and content of its products.
The plaintiff
is entitled to have all documents falling within Class 10, not
those which Caesarstone Australia chooses to give to the plaintiff.
will be an order for Caesarstone Australia to provide verified discovery of
Class 10 documents.
Class 12: Supply of Engineered Stone
Products to Particular Parties
12 is in the following terms:
“All documents, wherever created and located, relating to the supply/sale
of the... defendant’s engineered stone products
to the Plaintiff, Purity
Stone Pty Ltd, Stone-Tech (Holdings) Pty Ltd, Stone-Tech (Holdings) Australia
Pty Ltd, SWC BF (NSW) Pty
Ltd, Universal Granite Pty Ltd, Macarthur Marble &
Granite Pty Ltd, Royal Granite & Marbles Pty Ltd, Made in Stone, Wintim
Stone Australia Pty Ltd, products prior to 1 September 2019.”
12 is opposed by Caesarstone Australia, WK Marble and Laminex Group.
for the plaintiff submitted (MFI 2, pars 15, 24 and 37) that these documents are
relevant to:
(1) The issue of the plaintiff’s exposure to silica dust from his work
with each defendant’s stone products.
(2) The issue of any warnings which each defendant provided in respect of its
Counsel for Caesarstone Australia submitted (MFI 5, pars 11 and 12)
(1) This category seeks all documents relating to supply of the products by
Caesarstone Australia to the plaintiff’s employers.
(2) The category is too broad and requires a search for and an analysis of
documents that arguably relate in any way to such supply
and is virtually
open-ended.
(3) Caesarstone Australia would accept the category if confined to documents
that “record or evidence the supply/sale”,
rather than simply relate
to these things.
accept the submission of Senior Counsel for Caesarstone Australia that any
discovery should be limited in that fashion.
for WK Marble submitted (MFI 3, pars 30-36) as follows:
(1) The class is excessively broad and discovery is sought for an entire 19 year
period, irrespective of when the plaintiff worked
for any particular entity.
(2) WK Marble is amenable to a compromise which limits the class of documents
“All invoicing relating to the issues in the proceedings, being those
pertaining to the supply or sale of WKMG’s products
for those periods of
time that were either antecedent to, or that coincided with, dates on which your
client performed work for any
of the listed entities, whether as an employee or
as a subcontractor.”
approach is really an amalgam of the submission of Caesarstone Australia
recorded above, and the variation to Class 12 proposed
by Laminex Australia,
which is discussed immediately below.
for Laminex Group submitted (MFI 4, pars 22-26) as follows:
(1) Category 12 requires Laminex Group to identify, review, compile and produce
documents of no relevance to the proceedings, or
the issues in dispute between
the plaintiff and Laminex Group.
(2) The plaintiff has supplied particulars of the periods during which he
contracted with subcontractors, which would identify periods
within the range of
2008 to 2019 when he had exposure to a Laminex Group product.
(3) Laminex Group is willing to submit to a revised category regarding supply or
sale documents as follows:
“All documents, wherever created and located, relating to the supply
and/or sale of the tenth defendant’s engineered
stone products to:
(1) Universal Granite Pty Ltd between 1 March 2008 to 30
September 2019.
(2) Macarthur Marble & Granite Pty Ltd between 1 March 2008
to September 2019.
(3) Stone-Tech (Holdings) Pty Ltd between 1 March 2008 to
September 2019.
(4) Stone-Tech (Holdings) Australia Pty Ltd between 1 March
2008 to September 2019.
(5) Royal Granite & Marbles Pty Ltd between 1 April 2015
and 30 June 2015.
(6) Made in Stone between 1 May 2014 and 30 July 2017.
(7) Wintim Stone Australia Pty Ltd between April 2018 and 31
list is based upon particulars supplied by the solicitor for Mr Saroo (see DX 3,
par 10). It is logical to confine discovery
to those entities and those periods.
I accept the submission of counsel for Laminex Group that any discovery given by
Laminex Group
should be confined in that fashion. I also accept the submission
for Mr Saroo that, in relation to Caesarstone Australia and WK Marble,
relevant period for Stone Tech (Holdings) Australia Pty Ltd should be 17 August
2000 to September 2019.
is another company, named “SWC BF (NSW) Pty Ltd”, listed in Class
12. It is not mentioned in the detailed particulars
supplied by the
plaintiff’s solicitor in the letter dated 14 April 2023, which is annexure
“EV-2” to DX 3. This
omission was raised with the parties on 15 May
2024. Ms Wade provided an explanation regarding the need to include SWC BF (NSW)
Ltd in the discovery orders in her email dated 16 May 2024 (PX 2). I accept
that this company should be included in the discovery
orders. The relevant
period for this company is 30 October 2013 to September 2019.
course, Mr Saroo himself, and Mr Saroo’s own company Purity Stone Pty Ltd,
must be added to the list. The relevant period
for this entity is 1 April 2008
to September 2019.
find that, with the limitations discussed above, there should be verified
discovery in Class 12, as such documents are relevant
to whether or not Mr Saroo
was exposed to the products of Caesarstone Australia, WK Marble or Laminex
Group. A sensible way to provide
such discovery would be by adopting the format
of the draft list of documents to be found in PX 1, p
party has had some degree of success in relation to the contested categories of
documents. For that reason I propose to order
each party contesting the Notice
of Motion to pay his or its own costs.
Re-listing the

be inspected, I will re-list the proceedings for
