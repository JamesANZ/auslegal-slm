Pearson v Queensland Racing Licensing [2009] QRAT 3 (20 February 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
20 February 2009
Michael Ernest William Pearson
RESPONDENT:
Queensland Racing Licensing
APPEARANCES:
Mr Pearson on his own behalf and Mr Peter Smith the Licensing and
Training Manager for Queensland Racing
REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy Chairman
This is an appeal by Michael Ernest William Pearson against the decision of
the Respondent to refuse to issue a licence to enable
the appellant to be
classified as a Trackwork Rider. By letter of 13 January 2009 Mr Peter Smith
the Licensing and Training Manager
for Queensland Racing notified Mr Pearson in
the following terms:
Following a number of discussions and meetings with you regarding your
background in relation to dates, travel, residence in Australia
and abroad, your
NPC and other matters, the Licensing Committee continues to find that there is
inconsistency and lack of clarity
in your records and statements. This is
sufficient to conclude that a Licence cannot be issued.
Against the decision this appeal was lodged and the Grounds of Appeal stated
therein are:
The Appellant was denied natural justice in that he has supplied
immigration reports confirming he was not in Australia for a number
between 1989 and 2001. He has also supplied a Report from Q.C.S. confirming
that he has never been in Corrective Custody,
still his Trackwork Rider’s
permit has been refused. Although there are trainers and jockeys being granted
licences with jail
In his appearance before this Tribunal Mr Pearson pointed to a number of
matters that had been the subject of discussion in the transcript
of interview
between he and Mr B Turner a senior steward. He also referred to various
discussions he had with Mr Peter Smith the
Licensing and Training Manager and
letters that passed between them. He alleges that in all the circumstances he
has been denied
natural justice because the representatives of Queensland Racing
failed to take into account the representations that he made.
It was apparent to this Tribunal that Mr Smith, from Queensland Racing had
gone to great lengths in an attempt to assist Mr Pearson
but neither he nor
other representatives of Queensland Racing had been supplied documentation
sufficient, in the opinion of Queensland
Racing, that would identify Mr Pearson
or adequately prove that he was who he alleged to be. He had no passport, no
licence or no
other reasonable means of identification. He did provide a card
he suggested was a proof of identity card but that was of little
value to the Licensing Committee. On each occasion Mr Pearson sought assistance
he was afforded same. It cannot therefore
be said that he was denied natural
justice. The opposite in fact appears to this Tribunal to be true. It is
apparent that were
he to be capable of providing proper identification as to his
true identity and to his whereabouts on various salient dates the licence
he is seeking may be granted. He has simply not been able to provide any form
of satisfactory evidence and believes that this
Tribunal should simply overrule
the Licensing Committee based on his oral evidence.
This Tribunal has identified on many occasions that Committees must act
properly and in accordance with the rules of natural justice
and must take into
account all details and documents that are provided to it by any person seeking
to be licensed under its control.
Were that to have been the position here then
this Tribunal would have little difficulty in ordering that Mr Pearson be
Having reviewed all of the evidence that has been supplied both to Queensland
Racing and to this Tribunal it is apparent that Mr Pearson
has failed to
properly identify any reasonable document or identity or give any reasonable
explanation of the matters into which
the enquiry was opened. For that reason
this Tribunal is bound to find that this appeal must fail and so orders. The
dismissed and the deposit is forfeit.
