with dimensions marked on it and what the various cupboards were going to be

18 October 2010 a final Plan was sent. It was a Plan diagram with only some

fridge overhead etc and including

listed in one column, the price of the item was listed in the next column
the third column was a multiple of the column containing the number of items and
the price. The total price ex GST was $17,052.
Utting gave evidence that on the same day as the final quote, 18 September 2010,
he paid a deposit of $9,000.
Utting states that he sent to the Respondent an email saying “we needed to
meet”. Mr. Utting gave evidence that on
13 October a meeting was finally
arranged some three weeks after the initial request.
Mr. Utting gave evidence that:
(a) the doors were the wrong doors. They were not doors in Belinda
(b) he wanted the kitchen fitted before Christmas 2010.
Utting stated that he looked at the details of plans, drawers, and sinks etc on
3D Conceptual Plans provided by the Respondent.
He conceded that he could obtain
a “good visualization” of the job from these Plans.
13 October the Respondent stated that he was going to supply “hatch
doors” not “Belinda WL”. Mr. Utting
stated that his partner
was unhappy with this outcome and he asked that the doors be set
Utting also complained that the diagrams did not show the position of the
Carcass and panels and the relative widths.
Utting gave evidence he obtained a quote from Joyce Kitchens on 18 November 2010
and also on 26 November 2010 and the costs of
their kitchens amounted to
29 September 2010 the Respondent ordered the material but the order consisted of
“Shiree” pattern doors and not “Belinda
WL” doors as
specified in the agreement.
Tribunal members found that the Respondent altered without authority from the
Complainants the contract. The Respondent should
have obtained authorization
from Mr. Utting of the fact that “Belinda WL” pattern wasn’t
available and it was not
recommended by the manufacturer.
Complainants had complained that the doors ordered were incorrect and also that
they did not have paneling on the back as he had
reason the Respondent gave for ordering the different pattern doors was that the
manufacturer stated that they could not guarantee
“Belinda WL” doors
as the grooves in those doors weakened the structure of the door panel leading
to cracking and breakages.
This knowledge obtained by the Respondent was not
conveyed to the Complainants.
13 October 2010, there was a meeting on site at which there was no evidence that
any agreement was reached that the Complainants
would accept the door panel
design other than that of “Belinda WL”.
26 October 2010 the Respondent received delivery of the cabinet materials in
response to the order dated 29 September 2010.
the Tribunal’s view the fact that the Respondent ordered the
“Shiree” pattern door panels without authorization
Complainants, is fatal to their defence to the complaint.
Tribunal ordered that the Respondent is to repay the
Complainants’
$9,000 deposit within 14 days of the date of the
making of the order.
Tribunal considered but rejected the Complainants’ application for fees,
interest and costs.
The following orders were made:
the Respondent is to repay to the Complainants the deposit of
there be no payment to the Complainants of fees, interest and
