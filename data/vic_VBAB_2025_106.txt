Martinez & Anor v Alexopoulos [2025] VBAB
15 June 2025, the Applicants commenced an appeal proceeding in the Building
Appeals Board (
). The appeal was against the refusal to amend
several building permits that would effectively extend the dates by which
work under those building permits was to be completed. On 24 June
2025, the BAB convened a directions hearing, at which time orders
were made for
an expedited timetable to file supporting or opposing material; and that the
appeal be determined on the papers on
or after 10 July 2025. On 14 July 2025,
the BAB determined that:
Pursuant to
s 149(1)(a)
), the decision of the Respondent to refuse to amend
the completion dates of the building permits is affirmed.
follows are my reasons for that determination.
Building Regulations 2018
the Regulations
The relevant building surveyor may extend the commencement
date or completion date of the building work prior to the lapse of a building
permit if the relevant building surveyor considers that the extent of the
building work warrants an extension.
that end, in an email dated 7 May 2025 sent to the Applicants, the relevant
building surveyor (
If you require me to
consider a properly made request for a further extension to any of the first
three permits and an extension
to the stage four permit, please provide the
why the extent of the building work warrants an extension;
for the period of extension requested by reference to the extent of the building
work warranting an extension (noting in that
regard that there would need to be
special circumstances warranting an extension beyond 12 months);
confirmation,
with documentation, that the planning permit that is current, would remain
current to the date of extension requested.
a responding email, also dated 7 May 2025, the Applicants
Our application remains.
Should you wish to continue to misuse your position of power then
that’s a matter for you.
It is obvious that we have been forced to stop works due to the absence of a
final permit and expected timeframe has been provided
but if you wish to
continue unprofessional games then we will have no other choice than to legally
challenge them with costs to be
sought down the track.
Alternatively, please highlight which section of the Act requires me to
provide what you’re requesting.
reply, by email dated 16 May 2025, the RBS stated, in part:
your application for extensions continues to be based on allegations of failure
or wrongdoing on my part then that is not a
basis for me to extend the permits.
I have invited you to re-submit an application with proper reasons to enable me
to extend the
an email dated 12 June 2025, the Applicants stated, in part:
find attached extended planning permit confirmation as requested. You have the
power to independently assess my application.
Please confirm by 3pm tomorrow
(Frid 13/06/2025) if an extension will be granted.
RBS had on several occasions requested reasons as to why extending the
completion dates of the permits was required.
is a reasonable request. Indeed, it is generally accepted that if the reasons
support an extension to a building permit, the
relevant building surveyor would
usually grant the request.
find that the Applicants did not provide adequate or satisfactory reasons to the
RBS for the amendment of the completion dates of
the building permits.
the Applicants’ submissions filed in support of this appeal again fail to
particularise in sufficient detail what building
work remained under each of the
four permits. This is critical information as it informs the RBS (and the BAB on
appeal) whether
there are reasonable grounds for extending the building permits
and if so, for what period.
the lack of that information, I am unable to determine whether any extension is
warranted and, even if it was warranted, what
extension should be granted and to
which permit or permits the extension should be granted.
Notwithstanding
my determination, it is important to note that it is open to the Applicants to
make a fresh application or applications
for a new building permit or permits
related to what work remains to be undertaken. The Applicant should also note
that a refusal
to grant a building permit triggers fresh rights of an appeal to
