REASONS FOR DECISION
25 November 2008 Ms P O’Neil, Senior Member
McKenzie, Senior Member
Mr J Ashe, Member
This is the first of two applications arising from a dispute between
neighbours about a tennis court. Mr Peter and Mrs Janet Hill
applicants”
) live at 103 Hawkesbury Crescent Farrar. They sought an
Order under section 254 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991
“the Land Act”
) for the demolition of a tennis court fence
at the home of Ms Carmela Carrabs (
“the party joined”
105 Hawkesbury Crescent Farrar (
“the subject land”
Order was refused by the ACT Planning and Land Authority (
respondent”
) and the applicants have asked the Tribunal to review that
decision, which is a reviewable decision under the Act. The two matters
heard together on 11-12 November 2008.
2. A tennis court was approved on the subject land in 1973 and has been in
existence for many years. The tennis court lights, the
subject of the second
application (AT08/55), were erected some time after the court. This is one of a
number of tennis courts established
on the very large residential blocks located
on the upper side of Hawkesbury Crescent adjoining the Farrer Ridge Nature Park.
3. The tennis court with lights had been built when the applicants bought
their house in 1987. A complaint was made about it in
1994, but no further
complaints were made until 2007, after the party joined purchased the subject
block. Subsequently the applicants
complained to the authorities about noisy,
late night activities associated with the flood-lit tennis court.
4. In May and June 2007 the respondent received a complaint from the
applicants alleging that the tennis court and tennis court lights
unapproved. An inspection was carried out and files researched in an attempt to
ascertain whether the structures were unapproved.
The respondent concluded that
the fence had been approved as an integral part of the tennis court at the time
the subject land was
originally developed, but that the lights subsequently
erected did not have planning approval. The respondent then advised the party
joined to seek retrospective approval of the lights under the Act, which she did
in July 2007. That application sought “approval
of existing tennis court
lights”. The applicants objected to approval, but in October 2007 the
respondent gave the lights
conditional approval.
5. The respondent asserted that the approval had the effect of approving the
existing fence, despite also contending that the fence
had already been approved
more than 30 years earlier. As will be seen, whether the fence as well as the
lights was approved by the
decision of October 2007 is not a matter we need to
determine. In January 2008 the party joined provided an annotated drawing
to satisfy the conditions imposed by the decision of October 2007,
which showed among other things 91% shade cloth on the fence nearest
applicants’ home, aimed at ensuring that AS4282 was met as required by the
conditions of approval. The drawing was stamped
“approval granted”
and signed in April 2008. The applicants were advised of the decision but also
told that they had
no right to seek review of the decision.
6. Meanwhile, on 20 February 2008 after having seen the January 2008
drawing, the applicants sought an Order for the demolition of
the fence which is
the subject of this review. The applicants subsequently stated that they did not
necessarily want the fence demolished,
but reduced in size. Moreover they were
particularly concerned that the erection of a large area of heavy shade cloth
tennis court fence nearest to them was proposed. They said the shade
cloth would have a significant detrimental impact on their
amenity. The
respondent refused the application on 16 April 2008. The applicants
subsequently sought review of that decision to
refuse to make the Order
7. The respondent had earlier contended that the Tribunal lacked
Planning and Development Act 2007
did not include continued operation for the
purposes of an application of an Order made under
, Division 6.3 of the
Land Act. However, in submissions, Dr Jarvis for the respondent pointed out
that any difficulty so caused may
be overcome by virtue of
Legislation Act 2001
, which has the effect of maintaining existing rights.
Relying on that section, we consider that we have jurisdiction to review the
8. The issue of an Order is discretionary and would not necessarily flow
from a finding that the fence is an unapproved structure.
Were we to find the
fence unapproved, it would be necessary for us to consider, among other things,
that the fence has been in existence
for decades and there is very limited
evidence of difficulties associated with the fence itself. Although the
applicants pointed
out the difference in height of the tennis court fence from a
boundary fence it appears to us that the complaints of the applicants
much directed to the characteristics of the fence but more to the use of the
tennis court lights, instances of noisy behavior
at night and the possible use
of the fence to support heavy shade cloth. But as will be seen, it is not
necessary to consider the
making of the Order sought by the applicants.
The evidence
9. Written evidence was received from all parties. Oral evidence was heard
from Mrs Hill, Ms Carrabs and Mr Benjamin Green, an officer
of the respondent.
Mr Wagdy Hanna, an architect was has practised in Canberra since 1974 gave
expert evidence. In doing so Mr Hanna
had regard to the Building Manual first
issued by the Commonwealth Department of the Interior in 1967.
10. Documents before the Tribunal show that in December 1972 Plan No: 29980
was approved under the Building (Design and Siting) Ordinance
1964 (C’th)
for the construction of a house, garage and tennis court on the subject land.
The tennis court is shown as court
markings within a line to indicate the court
boundary, through which an entrance is marked. Mr Hanna opined that the court
line notionally indicated a fence through which there was to be an
entrance to the court, probably by a gate. In 1973 amendments
29980/A) approved, among other things, the inclusion of a power point for future
tennis court lighting and retaining walls
which are illustrated with close-set
parallel lines emerging from them. Mr Hanna’s evidence is that in
drafting terms such
lines mean a post of considerable height and his opinion is
that they illustrate fence poles for the tennis court fence. Aerial photographs
over the subsequent five years show the clearing which contains the court. A
Certificate of Occupancy and Use was issued in 1975
covering the works in those
two plans. We accept the expert evidence of Mr Hanna, consistent with the
interpretation of officers
of the respondent, that the tennis court and fence
were thereby approved in accordance with the approval practices and building
of the time.
11. Our view that the tennis court was covered by the 1975 Certificate is
reinforced by an examination of further documents. Between
1975 and 2003 plans
were approved for a swimming pool and other alterations. In 2003 plans were
approved for the construction of
a lift. Plan No.035914/A shows three classes
of structure: (1) those being approved in 2003; (2) the tennis court lights,
carry a stamp reading “NOT INCLUDED IN THIS APPROVAL”; and (3)
those not annotated, including the house, garage, tennis
court and fence, and
the swimming pool. We infer that the tennis court fence was considered in 2003
to have been previously approved
since it is treated in Plan No.035914/A in the
same way as other existing approved structures such as the house and swimming
12. The applicants submitted that as the 1975 Certificate of Occupancy and
Use did not in text specifically refer to the tennis court
but only to the
house, the fence had not been approved. We note however that it did refer to
both sets of plans on which the tennis
court, the fence lines and poles are
illustrated. The applicants relied upon
Eames and ACT Planning and Land
[2003] ACTAAT 43
(24 September 2003) to argue among other things,
in favour of a reduction in the size of the fence, but that case was different
significant respects.
dealt with a development application under
Division 6.2 of the Land Act dealing with a proposed development, rather than an
under Division 6.3. It was therefore subject to quite different legal
requirements. Moreover
may be distinguished from this case on its
13. As the tennis court fence was approved at that time, it is not open to a
decision-maker to issue an Order retrospectively for
its demolition or removal,
even though it may not meet the standards for such a fence in the Territory
Plan. The respondent further
submitted that the fence had been approved a
second time in 2007 in response to the development application dealing with the
court lights but, having found the fence already approved, it is not
necessary for us to consider that later approval.
14. The decision under review is affirmed. The application for an Order is
