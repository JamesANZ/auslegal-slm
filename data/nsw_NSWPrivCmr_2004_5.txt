Disclosure of personal information to employer while trying to avoid conflict of interest [2004] NSWPrivCmr 5 (1 January 2004)
Disclosure of personal information to employer while trying to
avoid conflict of interest
N made a complaint to NSW Department of Corrective Services (DCS)
alleging that a Governor of one of the NSW Correctional Centres
disclosed her personal information to her employer in an attempt to influence
the outcome of court proceedings. This was
done without her consent. N also
alleged that the information disclosed was inaccurate. N considered the
acceptable outcome of the
complaint would be a letter of apology and payment of
legal fees and personal damages incurred.
The complaint was treated as
an Internal Review under
Protection Act 1998
(the PPIP Act) and was investigated by DCS’s
solicitor. It was confirmed during the investigation that N had applied to the
Correctional Centre to sponsor an inmate there who was eligible for day leave
(this is a voluntary community program). As part of
her application N identified
her employer as a government department. The Governor admitted he then wrote to
N’s manager advising
him of N’s application as he was unsure how
appropriate the sponsoring arrangement would be given N’s place of
employment.
The Governor was concerned about potential conflict of interest.
Following the letter, a general inquiry was made by the government
department concerning the requirements for persons wanting to sponsor
Sometime after that, the Governor received a telephone call from an insurance
company employee attempting to obtain information
attendance at the Correctional Centre. The Governor declined to provide any
information.
The review found that Information Protection Principle 11
"Limits on disclosure of personal information" clearly applied in this instance
and was breached. Notwithstanding the Governor’s good intentions he had,
by his own admission, disclosed personal information
to the government
department for which the complainant worked. This was unauthorised and the
information was disclosed for a purpose
unrelated to the purpose for which it
was collected (the information was collected to conduct a criminal record
check). The review
also found that there was no evidence to support the
contention that it was the Governor who disclosed the information to the
In addition there was no evidence that the information was divulged
deliberately in order to influence the complainant’s court
proceedings.
The Governor stated that he was not aware of N’s court proceedings until
probable than not that this information was
disclosed to the insurer by the complainant’s employer. The complainant
specify how it was that the information provided was inaccurate. The
only information divulged by the Governor related to the complainant’s
application to become an inmate sponsor.
As a result of the Internal
Review the Department of Corrective Services apologised to N for unauthorised
disclosure of her personal
information to her employer. The Department did not
consider that payment of monetary compensation was appropriate. The Department
noted that the complainant was already represented in relation to her court
proceedings, and as she was successful in her claim,
the other party’s
insurer would have ultimately met her costs.
