ADMINISTRATION
the appointment of The Public Trustee of Queensland as administrator for BAF for
the following financial matter is revoked:
(a) The award of damages made pursuant to the order of the Supreme
Court of Queensland on 13 May 2005.
ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION HANDED DOWN AT HEARING
[1] On 29 August 2008, the Guardianship and
Administration Tribunal dismissed an application from BAF for a declaration
This decision was appealed to the Queensland Supreme Court who
set aside the decision on 2 June 2009 and remitted the proceedings
Tribunal. On 31 August 2009, the Tribunal heard the matter afresh.
[2] BAF is 50 years of age, she was born overseas and obtained a degree in Law
from University. She had been employed as a lawyer
overseas before marrying BR
and migrating to Australia in 1989. BAF had a stroke when giving birth to her
second child in 1998. She
received an award of damages in the Queensland Supreme
Court in May 2005. On April 24 2006, an application was received seeking a
declaration of capacity which was dismissed later that year.
[3] At the Tribunal hearing in August 2008, the Tribunal had reports from Dr C,
psychiatrist, and from Dr K, a psychologist. The
Tribunal was critical of these
reports in that they didn’t address issues on undue influence which had
been raised at the 2006
Tribunal hearing.
[4] For the hearing today, the Tribunal had the benefit of further reports from
Dr C and Dr K. The issue for the Tribunal today is,
does BAF now have capacity
for her financial matters, namely the management of funds representing the
balance of her damages award.
[5] Capacity is defined in the
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
(the Act). It is defined as follows:
, for a person for a
matter, means the person is capable of-
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
[6] The Tribunal must presume an adult has capacity for a matter unless the
evidence rebuts this.
[7] The Tribunal heard evidence from NB representing The Public Trustee of
Queensland that the Public Trustee presently manages approximately
$663,000 on
behalf of BAF and pays her monthly living expenses. He advised the Tribunal that
there was little contact between the
family and the Public Trustee.
[8] The Tribunal as indicated earlier received reports from Dr C and Dr K. Dr C
in his report dated 5 April 2009 expressed the opinion
that BAF has the capacity
to make complex financial decisions. In reaching this conclusion Dr C stated
“I consider that BAF has developed a good understanding of the nature
and of financial matters and of reflective decisions required
of her regarding
those finances”.
Dr C also expressed his view that BAF is not subject
to undue influence by her husband and that she is functioning autonomously.
It is my assessment that this is not a marital union involving
pathological issues of dominance and submission
”. Dr C addressed
BAF’s recovery as follows “
BAF is a glowing healthy example of
the healing capacity of the human brain based in the now unequivocally
recognised phenomenon of
plastic reassignment of activities within the brain
This is in the natural history course of BAF’s undoubted
recovery which proceeded over five years and has consolidated over
the past five
[9] Dr K stated in her report dated 23 March 2009, “
based on the
findings of Dr C in 2006 my previous findings in 2007 and the results of the
current assessment, I believe currently
BAF has capacity to make complex
financial decisions as described above and that she has the capacity to freely
and voluntarily to
make decisions about financial matters”.
[10] The Tribunal also noted BAF’s statement dated 14 August 2009 and in
particular her reference to the comments of Chief
Justice Young in
and the Protective Estates Act 1999 NSWSC456 of 1999 case. The
Tribunal considered these comments in consideration of the reports
of Dr C and
Dr K and noted that the comments in the above case were that remarkable
improvement in behavioural and cognitive estimates
have been made and these are
in the Tribunal’s view relevant to BAF’s case.
[11] The Tribunal also heard oral evidence from BR and BAF. The Tribunal accepts
that BAF found the Tribunal’s processes daunting
and that she was
distrustful of the Tribunal given her past perceptions of it.
[12] BAF could state the funds that she had available in her superannuation fund
not under the Public Trustee control. She advised
the Tribunal that she was
aware of the yearly payments made to her from both superannuation funds and was
accurate in this regard.
BR advised the Tribunal that he played no role in his
wife’s finances.
[13] The Public Trustee advised the Tribunal that it had no submissions to make
regarding capacity.
[14] BAF advised the Tribunal that the living expenses of her family were
approximately $64,000 per year and she indicated from whom
she would receive
advice in order to provide for some of these funds.
[15] The Tribunal makes the following findings of fact.
suffered a catastrophic stroke in 1998 and has made an exceptional recovery, the
process of which continues today;
(b) BAF has a
good understanding of her asset base and of the means by which she will manage
in the future utilising appropriate professional
(c) She had a
good understanding of her annual expenses and the areas for which expenditure
was required; and
demonstrates an understanding of prioritising of expenses and the Tribunal is
satisfied that BAF is able to make financial
decision independently and without
undue influence from her husband.
[16] The Tribunal finds that the evidence establishes that BAF can understand
the nature and effect of decisions about her financial
matters, that she is
capable of making decisions freely and voluntarily and that she is capable of
communicating decisions. The Tribunal
therefore determines that BAF has capacity
for all financial matters.
[17] The orders of the Tribunal are that BAF has capacity for all financial
matters and that the appointment of The Public Trustee
of Queensland as
administrator for BAF for managing the following financial matters, that is, the
award of damages made pursuant
to the order of the Supreme Court of Queensland
on 13 May 2005 is revoked.
