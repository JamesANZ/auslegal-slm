Victorian Pay-roll Tax liability for wages paid by an employer (PT-120) [2005] VICSROPT 8 (1 December 2005)
Revenue Rulings
Victorian Pay-roll Tax liability for wages paid by an employer
Revenue Ruling PT.120
Replaces PT.096
Section 6(1) of the
Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
(the Act) specifies the type of wages that are
subject to Victorian Pay-roll Tax. Liability
depends on two factors: where the wages are
paid and where the work is performed.
As there are several possible combinations of
these factors, employers may experience
difficulty in determining their Pay-roll Tax
liability where wages are paid or payable by
employers outside Victoria, or where wages
are paid in respect of work performed outside
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to clarify
the type of wages that must be declared in
Victoria for Pay-roll Tax purposes and to clarify
the liability for wages paid for services
performed in another country (or countries).
This Revenue Ruling takes effect from 1
January 1998.
Replacing Revenue Ruling PT.096, this
Revenue Ruling further clarifies section 6(1) of
the Act and explains Pay-roll Tax implications
on work performed outside any State or
Territory (as defined under the respective State
or Territory Pay-roll Tax legislation) but not in
another country. References to "Victoria" in this
Revenue Ruling include the coastal waters of
Victoria as defined in the Act.
Pay-roll Tax is payable when an employer's
total Australian wages exceed the general
exemption level. Australian wages comprise
Victorian wages and all interstate wages.
Victorian wages are the wages subject to tax
under the Act. Interstate wages are those
wages subject to tax in the other States and
Territories under their equivalent Pay-roll Tax
legislation.
To determine whether the wages paid or
payable in respect of each monthly return
period are subject to Victorian Pay-roll Tax, two
factors need to be considered:
� the place where the wages are paid or
payable; and
� the place where the services are performed.
Wages are deemed to be paid at the place of
receipt by the employee.
The following table shows the circumstances
in which wages are taxable in Victoria. It is
important to note that the liability for Victorian
Pay-roll Tax must be considered separately for
each calendar month.

Where an employee is working outside any
State or Territory (as defined under the
respective Pay-roll Tax legislation of the
relevant State or Territory), but not in another
country, the wages are taxable under the Act if
they are paid in Victoria. Employees working
on an oil rig would not be considered as
working in another country unless the oil rig is
physically located in another country.
Employees working in another country
10. Where services are performed by an employee
in another country whose wages are paid in
Victoria, the following points need to be
considered:
� Wages are exempt only if the employee has
worked in another country for a continuous
period of more than six months (wages for
the first six months will be taxable and any
wages paid after the six-month period will
not be subject to Pay-roll Tax);
� The six-month period does not have to be
within the one financial year but must be a
continuous period;
� Where an employee, working in another
country, returns to Australia in the following
circumstances, it will not be considered to
be a break in continuity;
for a holiday; or
to perform work exclusively related to
the overseas assignment for a period of
less than one month;
and in either case, the employee
immediately returns to that country to
perform further work on the assignment.

law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
