Re Wallace & Ors & Evans
[2006] QLRT 93
COUNSEL: N/A
SOLICITOR/S: N/A
Terrence Edwards (the miner)
currently holds ML3807. The mining lease was originally granted on 1 February
1974 for a period of 6
years. On 1 February 1980 the mining lease was renewed
for a further term of 6 years, and on 1 February 1986 the mining lease was
renewed, this time for a term of 21 years. On 22 January 2007 the miner lodged
an application for another renewal of the mining
lease for a term of 20 years
with the Mining Registrar, Mareeba
This determination of
compensation relates to access to the mining lease which includes access over a
property owned by
Dianne Calmsden, Matthew J. Mauloni, Robert T Mauloni,
Thomas J Mauloni, and Thomas S Mauloni (the landholders).
Tribunal Practice Direction
On 10 May 2007 the Tribunal
sent letters to the miner and the landholdes bringing the referral of this
matter to the Tribunal by the
Mining Registrar to their attention, and advising
them of their obligations under Practice Direction 1 of 2003. Timeframes for
submission of relevant material were provided to each party. The
landholders have made no submissions to the Tribunal. The miner
has submitted
that there should be no or minimal compensation as the access is an ungazetted
mining road which has been in existence
for at least 40 years; the landholders
conduct low intensity grazing; no grazing land will be impacted on by the road
that the existing access is poor, with any upgrading work undertaken
by the miner improving not diminishing the value of the land.
Unfortunately,
the miner’s submissions do not include any details of the length of the
access over the landholders’
It is not an uncommon
occurrence for either or both parties in a compensation matter before the
Tribunal to fail to comply with Practice
Direction 1 of 2003. The absence of
detailed, or any, compensation evidence clearly makes the task of the Tribunal
in determining
compensation very difficult. In the circumstances, I adopt the
analysis of the legislative provisions, compensation principles and
methodology
applied by Mining Referee Windridge in
Re Wallace & Ors & Evans
[2006] QLRT 93.
Determination
Taking into account all
heads of compensation in
subsection 3
Mineral Resources
(the Act), and absent any details of the area of land required for
access, and taking into account the miners submissions, I
compensation
for access in the minimal sum of $5.00 per annum for the term of the lease,
which equates to $100.00. Pursuant
s 281(4)(e)
of the Act, I award the
additional sum of $10.00.
Taking all relevant factors
into account, I order that the miner pay the total compensation of $110.00 to
the landholders within two
months from notification of the renewal of the mining
lease by the Mining Registrar.
