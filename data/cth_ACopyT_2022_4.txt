REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
PERRAM J (DEPUTY PRESIDENT):
parties remain in dispute about the terms of the summonses to be issued to Apple
Pty Ltd (‘Apple’), Netflix, Inc (‘Netflix’),
Network Ten
All Access Pty Limited (‘Paramount+’), Stan Entertainment Pty Ltd
(‘Stan’), and The Walt Disney
Company (Australia) Pty Ltd
(‘Disney’). Many of these disputes have been resolved by agreement.
Some have not. These
reasons deal with the disputed paragraphs of the proposed
summonses. During the course of the exchange of the parties’ submissions,
the Applicants, the Australasian Performing Right Association Limited and the
Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners’ Society
Limited (‘APRA
AMCOS’), varied some of the disputed paragraphs to address some of the
concerns. These reasons deal with
the disputed paragraphs in their final form.
SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE ISSUING OF SUMMONSES
present proceeding is a determination of a reference under
(Cth) (‘the Act’).
Section 154(4)
Act relevantly provides:
(4) The Tribunal shall consider a scheme referred under this section and,
after giving to the parties to the reference an opportunity
of presenting their
cases, shall make such order,
confirming or varying the scheme or substituting for the scheme another scheme
proposed by one of the parties, as the Tribunal considers reasonable in the
circumstances.
the scheme which has been referred to the Tribunal is a licencing scheme
proposed by APRA AMCOS. Two of the Respondents to
the proceeding, Netflix and
Stan, have proposed alternative schemes. The question for the Tribunal is
therefore whether it should
confirm or vary APRA AMCOS’ proposed scheme or
whether it should substitute for that scheme either of the schemes proposed
Netflix and Stan.
exercising the power under
, the Tribunal is not sitting as a court. It
is sitting as a price fixing tribunal which produces a determination which is
quasi-legislative
in nature. There are no pleadings and no formally defined
issues. Whilst the Tribunal must hear the parties on their cases and
them procedural fairness, it is not bound by the cases which they put. So much
is inherent in the power of the Tribunal to
vary a scheme. It is open to the
Tribunal, so long as it affords the parties procedural fairness, to do something
quite different
to what they propose. It also within its power to adopt a
scheme but for different reasons to those which are advanced in its support.
For example, the Tribunal might, in appropriate cases, consider the economic
analysis to be largely a thought experiment underpinned
by no real data and to
conclude instead that some other, more transparent, method of arriving at a
price was warranted.
power to require the production of documents is contained in
(3) A member or the Registrar may summon a person to produce
specified documents or articles to the Tribunal by producing the
documents or
articles to a specified person at a specified time at a specified place.
this power is not at large. It may be exercised only if it may be seen as
having a proximate connection with the exercise
of the power in
deciding whether a document sought by a summons has a sufficiently proximate
connection with the exercise of the power in
, the concept of relevance
is a useful one. However, in the determination of what is relevant for the
purposes of 154(4), two considerations
should be borne in mind.
in a reference proceeding such as the present, it is not the case as I have just
explained that the perceived issues between
the parties exclusively define the
scope of what is relevant to the exercise of the power in
flows from the fact the Tribunal is entitled to reject the pricing methodologies
put forward by them subject only to the
requirements of procedural fairness.
the question of what is relevant to the determination of the reference is likely
to be affected by the stage to which the
proceedings have progressed. As the
matter gets closer to a hearing, there will be an increased focus on the nature
of the dispute
between the parties. At the outset, however, it will generally
be more difficult to be dogmatic about what is relevant and what
is not. The
fact that the relevance inquiry tends to narrow over time is a well-known
phenomenon in ordinary civil litigation and
has frequently been remarked upon in
the context of attempts to set aside subpoenas: see
Gloucester Shire Council
v Fitch Ratings, Inc
[2016] FCA 587
per Wigney J.
combination of these two matters together widens further the caution with which
the Tribunal should approach relevance debates
in a context such as the present.
It will rarely be likely at this stage of the proceedings that it will be
appropriate to reject
the issue of a summons which seeks the production of
documents on a rigid view of what must be relevant or irrelevant. That degree
of forensic precision will rarely be present. For example, it was put by
Netflix that production of documents throwing light on
the approach its
management took to an earlier fee it agreed to pay APRA AMCOS could not be
relevant to the question of whether the
latter exercised monopoly power which
was instead to be determined by reference to the objective circumstances. It is
possible to accept that kind of dogmatism at this level. In my view,
it is possible that such material may be relevant to the exercise
of the power
I do not accept that it is appropriate to determine at this stage
that the Tribunal could not as a matter of law accept that the
Netflix’s management when negotiating the fee with APRA AMCOS were
relevant to whether APRA AMCOS was exercising monopoly
A Specified Document
is constrained by the need for the summons to seek an
identified document. Netflix submits that this requires the document to be
identified. If that is correct then it follows that a summons seeking a
document which ‘evidences’ or ‘relates
to’ some matter
would not be within the power conferred by
expression ‘to produce specified documents’ refers to documents
having the quality of having been specified. To specify
something, according to
the Macquarie Dictionary, is ‘to mention or name specifically or
definitely’ or ‘to state
in detail’. I therefore accept
Netflix’s submission that a summons requiring production of documents
which are not identified
lies outside the power in
It also follows
that a summons which is unclear in what it seeks production of will fail to
identify a specified document.
power under
is discretionary. Once satisfied that it is being asked to
seek the production of a specified document which has the requisite proximate
connection with the discharge by the Tribunal of its functions under
the Tribunal may still to refuse to issue the summons. The category of
situations in which that may occur is not closed. One situation,
concerns the situation where the Tribunal is satisfied that to require the
respondent to comply with the summons would be
unduly burdensome. Resistance to
the issue of the summons will require evidence of the existence of an identified
burden. If the
Tribunal accepts that the burden exists it must then weigh that
burden against its assessment of how necessary the documents sought
arrives at this question having already concluded that the proximate connection
is present. Necessarily, an assessment
of whether the burden is one which is
undue will be impressionistic and involve a degree of speculation about the
ultimate relevance
of the material. For the reasons I have given, considerable
circumspection is necessary at this stage of a proceeding such as the
Non-existent Documents
fact that a document does not exist is not a reason for not issuing a summons
for its production. The fact the summons is answered
with the response
‘There are no documents produced’ is a formal act which, if false,
has criminal consequences under
Further, it may be relied on by
another party subsequently to prove that there are no such documents. By
contrast, the same statement
made in a submission to the Tribunal to persuade it
not to issue a summons, has no such consequences. The proposition that there
are no documents to produce is therefore not generally a reason not to issue a
Sabre Orders
AMCOS has sought the issue of summonses containing what is effectively an order
that the recipient make a request of its parent
(or other members of its group)
to produce documents. This practice overcomes the difficulty that often enough
a subsidiary will
not have possession of all of the documents. Such orders are
made in curial proceedings: see
Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Russ
Kalvin’s Hair Co
[1993] FCA 557
(1993) 46 FCR 428
at 431-432 per Lockhart J
’). Generally, a
order is not made
unless there is reason to believe that the third party will comply with the
request. In the case of intra-group
requests, this will usually be
straightforward because the failure to produce the document may lead to the
drawing of a
Jones v Dunkel
inference: see
Jones v Dunkel
[1959] HCA 8
101 CLR 298

Respondents dispute the power of the Tribunal to make such an order. APRA AMCOS
which provides:
In proceedings before the Tribunal:
(a) the procedure of the Tribunal is, subject to this Act and the
regulations, within the discretion of the Tribunal;
(b) the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence; and
(c) the proceedings shall be conducted with as little formality, and with
as much expedition, as the requirements of this Act and
a proper consideration
of the matters before the Tribunal permit.
were a blank canvas I would read the reference to ‘the procedure of
the Tribunal’ in
as a reference to the procedure adopted
during the ‘proceedings’ referred to in the first line.
Section 164
clearly applies to the actual hearing of a reference under
also accept that it applies to any interlocutory hearings before that final
hearing. Overall, I would read
as specifying how the Tribunal is to
conduct its hearings. The power to determine in its own discretion what its
procedure is would
not in my opinion extend to an order requiring a party to do
something outside of the context of a hearing.
the Tribunal has previously adopted a broader view of the operation of
Reference by Phonographic Performance Company of Australia Ltd
, it was held by Emmett P that the power in
extended to empowering the Tribunal to order the person seeking the issue of a
summons to pay the expenses of a person required to
comply with that summons.
At [10], Emmett P reasoned that the power was ‘implied from or are
incidental to’ the power
to issue the summons, citing a decision of
Lockhart P sitting in the then Trade Practices Tribunal (now the Australian
Competition
Tribunal) in
Re John Dee (Export) Pty Ltd
(1990) ATPR 41-006.
It would appear to follow from this that any power which can be implied from or
be seen as incidental to, the power in
will be within the power
conferred by
P’s interpretation of
is broader than the one I favour. Although
the Tribunal is not bound by its own decisions, there is a public interest in
decision making. The decision has stood for 13 years and I do not
think it would be appropriate to depart from that interpretation.
I therefore
conclude that if a power can be seen as incidental to the exercise of another
power which the Tribunal has, then
confers that power on the Tribunal.
is a power to require a person to produce a document. In my
view, it is incidental to that power to require a party before the Tribunal
ask another person to produce a document. The power in
fruitless if the person to whom a summons is addressed does not have possession
of a document although it is in the possession
of a parent entity. To make the
power to order production efficacious it is therefore incidental to that power
to order a party
before the Tribunal to request another party for the document.
Consequently,
I accept that
order to be made against a
respondent. Before such an order is made, the Tribunal should be satisfied that
there are reasonable grounds
for thinking that the request will be complied
with. Where the parties of whom the requests will be made are parent or related
of one of a parties before the Tribunal, I am satisfied that such
grounds exist. They exist because of the possibly adverse inferences
arise if the request is not complied with.
then to the particular complaints made by each of the Respondents:
disputes concern paragraphs 1(c), 1(h), 1(i) and 2.
Paragraph 1(c)
current form of the disputed paragraph is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(c) For the period 2019 to date, one or more documents, recording the total
costs, and the total costs under the following items,
incurred in relation to
conducting the Service in Australia (wherever those costs are incurred) for each
financial year:
(i) content costs (broken down by acquisition and commissioned spend);
(ii) music costs;
(iii) variable costs (eg. delivery and billing); and
(iv) fixed costs (eg. distribution costs, marketing, technology, staff,
submitted that it would onerous for it to comply and that 1(c) was not clear.
As to the first of these contentions, it submitted
that identifying the
documents that recorded the costs referred to in (c) would be a very complicated
exercise because it does not
record such costs by country. It would therefore
be required to search for and examine primary documents such as emails and
An additional problem would be that the costs might be attributable
to more than one service.
was no evidence to this effect and hence no way of determining whether the
suggested burden is undue. Even if there had been
evidence to the effect eluded
to by Apple, I would not have accepted that the burden was undue. I am far from
persuaded at this
stage that Apple’s costs are irrelevant to the exercise
by the Tribunal of its function under
do I accept the second contention. Apple initially submitted that its problems
were compounded by the words ‘
in relation to
conducting the Service
in Australia’ (emphasis added). Its complaint was that it was unclear
whether, for example, it picked
up a catering cost. This led APRA AMCOS to add
subparagraphs (i)-(iv) to the summons. Apple then submitted that it was now too
broad because of the words ‘wherever those costs are incurred’. I
do not accept Apple’s submission. It is clear
what 1(c) requires.
Paragraph 1(c) is therefore appropriate. For completeness, Apple did not submit
that 1(c) did not seek a ‘specified’
Paragraph 1(h)
paragraph is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(h) Any documents authored or created by, for, or on behalf of, senior
management or executives of Apple, or board papers or minutes,
recording or
evidencing Apple’s consideration of, and/or reasons for agreeing to or
resisting the licence fee payable to APRA
AMCOS for the communication and
reproduction of musical works on the Service in the period 6-months prior to the
entering into of
any licence with APRA AMCOS.
submitted that this paragraph was excessive because it would have to search its
records including internal emails and text and
chat messages. There is no
evidence of how burdensome this is for Apple and therefore no occasion to
consider the matter further.
Apple also took issue with the words
‘recording or evidencing Apple’s consideration of’. It was
said that ‘evidencing’
might capture fleeting references. I do not
accept this submission. Consequently, I will permit 1(h). Again, it was not
that the paragraph lay outside the requirement that the document be
Paragraph 1(i)
paragraph is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(i) Any documents authored or created by, for, or on behalf of, senior
management or executives of Apple, recording or evidencing
consideration of, and/or reasons for agreeing to or resisting the licence fee
payable to a collecting society for the
communication and reproduction of
musical works on the Service in the period 6-months prior to the entering into
of any licence with
that collecting society in each of the following
territories:
(i) the Czech Republic;
(ii) Finland;
(iii) France;
(iv) Germany;
(v) Hong Kong;
(vi) the United Kingdom, or any part thereof;
(vii) the Republic of Ireland; and
(viii) Sweden.
submitted that it had not been explained why Apple would have such documents.
Since there was no reason to think that it had
any such documents, it would be
wasteful to require Apple to comply with it. I reject this submission for the
reasons I have already
given. It was also said to be overbroad and vague. I do
not agree – it was clear.
Paragraph 2
paragraph is as follows:
To the extent that any of the documents answerable to 1(g) and 1(i) above are
not in the power, custody or control of Apple, Apple
is to take all reasonable
steps available to it to obtain the documents, or copies thereof, and produce
those documents. If the documents
are not produced by 4:00pm on 31 April 2022,
Apple, by a representative having knowledge of the facts, is to file and serve
an affidavit
as to Apple’s efforts made pursuant to this
submitted that: (a) this was not a category of document; (b) it was in the
nature of a
order; (c) the Tribunal lacked power to make a
order; and (d) if it did have power, it ought not to exercise it. I accept
(a) and (b). However, a
order has no place in a summons. I reject
(c) and (d) for the reasons I have given.
those circumstances, the summons may be issued with paragraphs 1(c), (h) and
(i). I will not grant leave to include the
order in the summons.
I will however make such an order separately upon APRA AMCOS furnishing a draft
to my chambers.
disputed paragraphs are 1(c), 1(e), 1(g), 1(h), 1(i) and 2.
Paragraph 1(c)
is essentially the same as paragraph 1(c) for Apple. However, unlike Apple,
Netflix submits that the documents sought are not
relevant to an issue before
the Tribunal. The documents sought would appear to be directed at ascertaining
what the costs are for
Netflix in conducting the Netflix service in Australia.
APRA AMCOS explained the relevance of 1(c) as follows: APRA AMCOS seek by
reference the imposition of a fee calculated as a percentage of Netflix’s
Australian revenues. Netflix by contrast proposes
a per subscriber per month
(PSPM) fee or a fee based on a percentage of revenue with the minimum and
maximum fee payable capped by
reference to the number of subscribers per month.
APRA AMCOS submits that Netflix’s costs are relevant because its expert
evidence may show that one justification for an increase in the percentage rate
may be that a licensee’s costs have decreased
or that its profits as a
proportion of revenue have increased. For the reasons I have given it would be
inappropriate to uphold
this objection at this stage.
Paragraph 1(e)
1(e) is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(e) For the period 2015 to date, all reports made to Australian Communications
and Media Authority in respect of the service.
again objects on the basis of relevance. As above, APRA AMCOS says the
relevance is that the expert evidence may reveal that
the costs of Netflix may
be relevant to the calculation of the fee. I reject Netflix’s objection
for the same reason as I
reject its objection to paragraph 1(c).
Paragraph 1(g)
is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(g) Insofar as they have not been previously produced in the proceedings, all
licence agreements (both current and historical) for
the reproduction and
communication of musical works on the Service with collecting societies in the
following territories:
(i) the United Kingdom, or any
part thereof;
(ii) the Republic of Ireland;
(iii) Canada;
(iv) France;
(v) Germany;
(vi) Sweden;
(vii) Brazil;
(viii) Korea;
(ix) Chile;
(x) Finland;
(xi) Columbia;
(xii) Peru;
(xiii) Portugal;
(xiv) Czech Republic;
(xv) Hong Kong;
(xvi) Ecudaor; and
(xvii) Uruguay.
has already produced these documents immediately prior to the date that it began
providing the service in Australia, and as
at 3 November 2021. APRA AMCOS
wishes to see whether the rates have changed over that period. Objection is
taken to the fact that
17 countries are involved. I do not accept this
Paragraph 1(h)
is as follows:
are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on 31
April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(h) Any documents authored or created by, for, or on behalf of, senior
management oir executives of Netflix, or board papers or
minutes recording or
evidencing Netflix’s consideration of, and/or reasons for agreeing to or
resisting the licence fee payable
to APRA AMCOS for the communication and
reproduction of musical works on the Service in the period 6-months prior to the
into of the licence with APRA AMCOS on 24 March 2015.
(error in original).
submits that its subjective assessment of its APRA AMCOS fee is irrelevant to
the question of whether it had ‘no choice’
other than to enter into
a licence with APRA AMCOS and was thus subject to monopoly power. The argument
was that the subjective
understandings of Netflix’s management were not
relevant to the objective question of whether APRA AMCOS was exercising monopoly
power. I am not prepared to accept this argument at the summons stage. I see
no issue with clarity in relation to this paragraph.
accept Netflix’s contention that the words ‘evidencing’ means
that 1(h) does not ‘specify’ a document
as required by
I reject the same argument in relation to the word ‘recording’. I
reject paragraph 1(h) in its current form but
would issue it with the word
‘evidencing’ removed.
Paragraph 1(i)
is as follows:
are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on 31
April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(i) Any documents authored or created by, for, or on behalf of, senior
management or executives of Netflix recording or evidencing

territories:
(i) the Czech Republic;
(ii) Finland;
(iii) France;
(iv) Germany;
(v) Hong Kong;
(vi) the United Kingdom, or any part thereof;
(vii) the Republic of Ireland; and
(viii) Sweden.
reject Netflix’s relevance objection for reasons already given. Nor am I
persuaded that it is unduly burdensome.
Paragraph 2
to it being clarified that the steps to be taken by Netflix relate only to
seeking the documents from members of its own group
of entities, I accept that
order should be made (but not in the summons).
objects to notes (a) and (d) and paragraphs 1(b), 1(h), 1(i) and 2 of the
proposed summons.
is as follows:
(a) A reference to Paramount+ includes a reference to any of its related bodies
corporate, aside from paragraph 1(e) and 2 below.
do not read note (a) as having the effect that the summons is addressed to all
of its related bodies. This is because it does not
say such a thing and because
it would entail that the summons, whilst appearing to be addressed to one entity
was, in fact, addressed
to a number of unidentified entities. This would be
procedurally irregular and I do not read the draft summons this way. That being
so, I read note (a) as being intended to apply to the body of the summons.
that assumption, the carve out for 1(e) makes no sense since Paramount+ is not
referred to in that paragraph. I think it would
be unlikely that that Paramount+
had possession of the documents sought insofar as they were the documents of the
related entities.
The likely purpose of this definition is to work with the
order in paragraph 2. As I shortly conclude, the
order should not be in the summons. Since it is to be excised, this
definition should be too.
is as follows:
(d) Production pursuant to categories 1(a); 1(b); 1(c); and 1(f) will be deemed
sufficient by the provision of a summary statement
on underlying business
records in lieu of the records themselves. However, APRA AMCOS reserves the
right to inspect the underlying

This debate has no place in the form of the
summons. Note (d) will be deleted.

is as follows:
are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on 31
April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(b) For the period 2018 to date, one or more documents evidencing the total
revenue for each Quarter generated directly or indirectly
by operation of the
Service in Australia.
submits that it is unclear what indirectly generated revenue means. In
correspondence, APRA AMCOS has indicated that indirect
revenue refers to
‘revenue received other than from subscription fees, and is therefore not
reported under the current licensing
arrangements’. The wording suggested
by APRA AMCOS will be incorporated into 1(b).
Paragraph 1(h)
is as follows:

first objection is relevance which, for reasons already given, I reject. The
second objection is burden which I also reject.
The third is a lack of clarity
which I reject.

objections are breadth, oppression and relevance. I reject each.

(a) A reference to Disney includes a reference to any of its related bodies

objection is that this definition extends the service to its provision in every
country where the service is provided. APRA AMCOS
confirms that this was its
intent. The word ‘Service’ appears in 1(a), 1(b) and 1(f) in terms
which make clear that
the service being discussed is the service in Australia.
It is referred to in paragraph 1(c) which also make clear that it is the
providing the Service everywhere that is being examined so that allocation to
Australia can be determined. I see no problem
with note (b) in that context.
It is also referred to in paragraph 1(e) where the context makes plain that it
is the Australian
service which is being discussed. Paragraph 1(h) is as
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles

resisting the licence fee payable to APRA
AMCOS for the communication and
reproduction of musical works on the Service in the period 6-months prior to the
entering into of

it would be deliberately obtuse to read this as applying to anything but the
Australian service I accept that it can be read
that way. The definition in
note (b) will remain but paragraph 1(h) will be amended to make the obvious
Paragraph 1(b)
is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if

(b) For the period 2019 to date, one or more documents evidencing the total
revenue for each Quarter generated directly or indirectly
by operation of the
Service in Australia.

limited. I reject the vagueness and oppression challenges.
Paragraph 1(c)
is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if
available):
(c) For the period 2019 to date, one or more documents, recording the total
costs, and the total costs under the following items,
incurred in relation to
conducting the Service in Australia (wherever those costs are incurred) for each
Quarter, or if unavailable
on a quarterly basis, for each financial year:
(i) content costs (broken down by acquisition and commissioned spend);
(ii) music costs;
(iii) variable costs (eg. delivery and billing); and
(iv) fixed costs (eg. distribution costs, marketing, technology, staff,

complaint. I reject the oppression argument.

You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on

Paragraph 1(i):
is as follows:
You are summoned to produce to the Copyright Tribunal of Australia by 4:00pm on
31 April 2022, the following document or articles
(in electronic form if

(i) Any documents authored or created by, for, or on behalf of, senior

(iii) France;
(iv) Germany;
(v) Hong Kong;
(vi) the United Kingdom, or any part thereof;
(vii) the Republic of Ireland; and

Paragraph 2
Tribunal has the power to make an order of this nature although not in the form
of a summons. Disney correctly submits that as
drafted the form of paragraph 2
requires Disney to request the documents from the whole world. Plainly, it
should be limited to
Disney entities.
AMCOS should now prepare appropriate orders and summonses for issue within 7
days which give effect to these reasons. They are
to be sent to my chambers
where they will be made and issued respectively.
