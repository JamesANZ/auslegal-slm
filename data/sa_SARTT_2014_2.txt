Faisal v Maio [2014] SARTT 2 (30 January 2014)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 30 JANUARY
Hearing 30 January 2014 at Adelaide
FAISAL v MAIO (RT14/0002)
Application by tenants for compensation and return of goods.
RTT finds that any claims by the tenant that the landlord has disposed of his
possessions which are worth > $30,000 must be taken
in the Magistrates Court.
The tenant abandoned the property at a point after he moved out and his
sub-tenants also moved out. At
that point noone was paying rent and the landlord
was therefore entitled to deal with his belongings as abandoned goods. Property
stored there by someone other than the tenant but with the tenant’s
permission, could also be treated as abandoned goods by
the landlord. Therefore
landlord was entitled to arrange for storage of car (belonging to tenant’s
friend) and the tenant (or
the tenant’s friend) was obliged to pay the
operator of the storage facility in order to retrieve the car. Landlord to
tenant with details of storage facility and reasonable access to the
garage to retrieve items still remaining at the property.
On 21 January 2014 the Tribunal received an application from the tenant
seeking orders from the Tribunal for compensation and the
return of goods due to
the landlord’s failure to comply with the order of the Tribunal made on 3
January 2014.
The details of the tenancy are contained in the Tribunal order made on 3
January 2014 and I will not repeat them here except to note
that the order
incorrectly refers to the tenants as Don Priyangani Jayasinghe and Javid Faisal
but in fact Javid Faisal only is the
The order made on 3 January 2014 was apparently by agreement. At this hearing
the parties both stated that they did not agree with
what was recorded in the
Tribunal order.
The Tribunal order was that:-
tenants’ goods stored at the property be released to them on Saturday 4
January 2014 at 12.00 noon;
The landlord was
to arrange for the tenant’s motor vehicle to be returned to the tenant on
or before Tuesday 21 January 2014;
The tenants must
pay the landlord $550.00 per week until the total amount of $1,240.00 is

He did not rent
out the property again until January 2014 (but he did not have a copy of the new

their belongings on that day.
The tenant gave evidence that:-

property in October 2013 but his sub-tenants remained in the property until
December 2013 and continued to pay rent;
The landlord was
lying in his evidence about rent;
Ms Jayasainghe
left a significant number of valuable items in the shed which have been
destroyed or disposed of by the landlord, the
total value of those items is
approximately $30,000.00 and she has witnesses who will give evidence in support
of her claim;
The car which
has been removed from the property by the landlord belongs to Ms Jayasainghe and
as she is not a tenant, the landlord
is not entitled to remove it and should be
required to return it;
This matter has
been reported to the police;
The police have
advised the tenant not to retrieve the remaining items in the shed.
Conclusions and findings
As I explained to the tenant at the hearing, if the tenant has a claim for
goods which he says have been stolen or destroyed by the
landlord and the total
value of those goods is approximately $30,000.00, then that claim must be
pursued in the Magistrates Court.
I also explained to the tenant at the hearing that if the police decide to
press criminal charges against the landlord, then the criminal
proceedings can
proceed at the same time as any proceedings brought by the tenant in the
Magistrates Court for compensation.
I consider that there was a tenancy for a fixed term until the expiry of that
term, and then the tenancy became periodic. In about
October the tenant ceased
to reside in the property but the tenancy continued because sub-tenants remained
in the property with his
permission. At some point the sub-tenants abandoned the
property and ceased paying rent. According to the landlord this occurred
October. According to the tenant this occurred in December. In any event, I find
that the tenancy terminated when the sub-tenants
abandoned the
There may well have been property belonging to Ms Jayasainghe stored at the
property but it was stored there with the consent of the
tenant. Therefore once
the tenancy terminated I consider that the landlord was entitled to deal with
the property as abandoned goods
in accordance with the provisions in the
In the circumstances I will make an order that the landlord will contact the
operator of the storage facility and instruct the operator
to release Ms
Jayasinghe’s car to her or the tenant upon them paying the storage fee of
$900.00 (to the operator). I will also
make an order that the landlord provide
the tenant with access to the shed in order to remove any of their belongings
from the shed.
As I explained at the hearing, if the landlord has placed his own
items or rubbish in the shed then the tenant is under no obligation
I will make one final observation about this matter and that is that I find
it very unusual that the landlord would not make the necessary
arrangements for
a new tenant to move into the property for approximately 3 months after the
tenant and the sub-tenants vacated the
property. Therefore I will require the
landlord to provide to the Tribunal a copy of the tenancy agreement with the new
I set aside the order of the Tribunal made on 3 January 2014 and
substitute the following orders instead.
landlord must provide to the Tribunal a copy of the agreement with the new
tenant within 7 days of the date of this order.
landlord must inform the operator of the storage facility that the car which has
been stored at that facility by him and which
belongs to Ms Jayasinghe, must be
released to Ms Jayasinghe or the tenant subject to them paying the operator the
storage fee of
landlord must provide the tenant with access to the garage/shed on the property
between the hours of 9.00am and 5.00pm on Saturday
8 February 2014 and Sunday 9
