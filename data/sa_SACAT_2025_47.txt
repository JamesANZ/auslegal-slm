2024/SA000824
The Tribunal considered the appropriate consequential orders resulting from
the setting aside of a decision made by the respondent
upon making the finding
that a delegate decision-maker did not have the authority to make the decision
to remove a child from the
care of an approved carer.
The applicant applied for an award of costs which was opposed by the
respondent on the basis that the decision-maker’s error
deliberate.
Held, remitting the decision back to the respondent for reconsideration
pursuant to s 37(1)(c)(ii) of the SACAT Act, making an order
for costs in the
applicant's favour and allowing an application for confidentiality with regard
to an affidavit submitted by the
respondent:
circumstances of the impugned decision being made beyond power were within the
control and knowledge of the respondent, and
the manner in which the decision
was documented obscured the decision, and that the decision-making process did
not comply with the
respondent’s own policy guidelines, were all relevant
to the question of whether the applicant should bear the cost of undertaking
contested hearing to establish the factual circumstances of the decision.

Findings of the Tribunal
10 June 2025, I set aside the respondent’s purported decision dated on or
proceedings were called back on for consideration of further orders.
parties made submissions in respect of the Tribunal’s powers pursuant to
South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
(‘SACAT Act’).
substantive merits of the application for review have not been ventilated.
Further, significant time has now elapsed since the
purported decision was made
and implemented, and events relevant to what would now be the correct or
preferable decision have occurred.
The Tribunal is not in a suitable position to
make a substituted order without commencing afresh.

decision to the respondent for reconsideration.
In so doing, I make no finding
and express no legal conclusion as to whether the respondent is entitled to
delegate the decision-making
on a remittal.
Tribunal declines to issue directions or recommendations, as they are not apt
where the decision failed due to having been made
beyond power in circumstances
that are fully described in the Tribunal’s decision of 10 June 2025.
decline to make ancillary orders, if I am empowered to do so, as to where the
child is placed before a further decision is made.
Such a decision would
inevitably entail receiving contested evidence. Given that the Department is in
a position to make a reconsidered
decision within 21 days, it would not be
expedient to embark on a course of taking evidence for an interim decision.

error was not deliberate and the Department’s
case was not unarguable.
There being no relevant provision governing costs in respect of this particular

Tribunal is obliged to take into account certain matters listed in s 57(2). The

circumstances of the impugned decision being made beyond power were
circumstances within the control and knowledge of the Department.
The date on
which the decision was purported to have been made was the subject of differing
evidence by the decision-maker. The manner
in which the decision was documented
obscured the decision. The decision-making process did not comply with the
Department’s
own policy guidelines. These are relevant to the question of
whether the applicant should bear the cost of having had to undertake
contested hearing to establish what the decision was, when it occurred, and
whether it was within power. It is appropriate to award
the applicant her costs
of the proceedings, on the standard basis, to be agreed or taxed. Costs are to
be calculated in accordance
with r 101 of the South Australian
Administrative Tribunal Rules 2014
as amended.

affidavit was filed in anticipation of its use in today’s hearing. I have
considered the affidavit

paragraphs 1 and 2 of the interlocutory application, but I do not consider
