Multicard: Own motion investigation report
[2014] AICmrCN 2
(1 May 2014)
Timothy Pilgrim, Australian Privacy Commissioner
11 February 2013, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)
opened an own motion investigation into Multicard
Pty Ltd (Multicard). This was
in response to information received from the Office of Transport Security (OTS)
that personal information
of a large number of Multicard applicants was publicly
accessible online.
The Commissioner’s investigation focused on whether Multicard took
reasonable steps to protect customer information from misuse
and loss and from
unauthorised access, modification or
disclosure.
After considering the facts of the case, submissions from Multicard and the
relevant provisions of the
(Privacy Act),
the Commissioner came to the view that Multicard had breached the
failing to take reasonable steps to secure the personal information it held. The
Commissioner also found that Multicard had unlawfully
disclosed personal
information.
16 January 2013, the OAIC received information from OTS that personal
information collected by Multicard for the purpose of assessing
and granting
applications for a Maritime Security Identity Card (MSIC; the MSIC information)
had been made publicly accessible online
(the data breach).
The following elements led to the data breach:
Multicard stored
information about MSIC applicants in a folder labeled ‘uploads’
(uploads folder) on a publicly accessible
web server.
Multicard stored
the MSIC information in randomly named sub-folders in the uploads folder.
incorrectly configured the MSIC website to allow directory browsing, including
of the uploads folder and its sub-folders.
Multicard did
not configure its website to request search robots not to index the parts of the
MSIC website that were not intended
to be publicly accessible, including the
uploads folder and its sub-folders.
Google indexed
the uploads folder on and from 23 September 2012, making photos of MSIC
applicants and other information discoverable
via Google search between 23
September 2012 and 16 January 2013 (when Multicard responded to the
The data breach resulted in the following personal
information about MISC applicants being made publicly accessible online:

NPP 4 (Data security) and NPP 2 (Use and disclosure) are the
provisions relevant to this incident. In particular:
NPP 4.1 required
organisations to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information they
hold from misuse and loss and from
unauthorised access, modification or
disclosure, and
NPP 2.1 provided
that an organisation may only use or disclose personal information for the
primary purpose of collection, unless
an exception
Security of personal information (NPP 4.1)
assessing whether Multicard took reasonable steps to comply with NPP 4.1, the
Commissioner considered information from Multicard
in place relating to the MISC information contained in the uploads folder, and
what steps would have
been reasonable in the circumstances to protect the
personal information held. The Commissioner also had regard to the guidance set
out in the OAIC’s
Guide to information
Multicard stated that prior to the data breach, it had taken the following
measures to protect the breached data:
access to the MSIC website (which included the uploads folder) to authorised and
authenticated users
obscured file
names with random data, to ensure they were not guessable, and
implemented
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security.
Restricted access to the MSIC website
stated that access to the MSIC website was restricted to authenticated users.
However, the Commissioner found that this
was not the case. Access to the
uploads folder was not restricted to authorised users; Multicard allowed access
to the uploads folder
without requiring a password, username or other
authenticator to establish the identity of the user. As a result, the MSIC
information
was able to be accessed by unauthorised third parties, including
The Commissioner noted that restricting access to non-public content is a
basic security step to protect information hosted on web
servers. Restricting
access to authorised and authenticated users of the uploads folder would have
prevented access to the MSIC information
by unauthorised third parties,
including search robots.
File names and directory browsing
Multicard’s
security steps included storing the MISC information in randomly named
sub-folders within the uploads folder. Multicard
stated that the intention was
that an unauthorised third party would not be able to guess the sub-folder
names, and so would not
be able to locate the MSIC information.
Multicard indicated that prior to the data breach, directory browsing was
inadvertently enabled on its web servers. Enabling directory
browsing caused the
web server to automatically generate an index page listing all files in the
uploads folder. This negated any
need for unauthorised third parties to guess
sub-folder names in order to discover the MSIC information, and thus eliminated
security value of implementing ‘non-guessable’ sub-folder names.
In the absence of other security measures such as access
restrictions (see
above), this allowed search robots to access and index the uploads folder. The
indexing of the uploads folder by
Google facilitated discoverability of the MSIC
information.
The Commissioner noted that disabling directory browsing is a standard
security step available when configuring web servers, and a
fundamental security step when hosting content not intended for public access.
Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
advised that prior to the breach, it had secured its website using SSL, and that
access [to the MSIC website] was unable
to occur without
However, during the course of the investigation, the Commissioner found that
access to the uploads folder did not require authentication,
and that SSL was
not implemented on that part of the MSIC website.
The Commissioner noted
that using cryptographic protocols such as SSL may in some circumstances be a
reasonable step to secure information
while it is being transmitted over the
internet. However, the end point of the transmission must also be secure. This
securely transmitting information to an insecure location will not
produce a reasonable security outcome.
Appropriate instructions to search robots
Commissioner found the indexing of the upload folder by Google indicated that
Multicard did not configure its website to request
GoogleBot (via the robots.txt file) not to index, archive or cache the uploads
Configuring websites to provide appropriate instructions to search robots is
a basic element of website security. Had Multicard configured
its website
appropriately it would have prevented the indexing of the uploads folder by
GoogleBot. This would have significantly
limited the discoverability of the
uploads folder, and may have prevented access by unauthorised third parties.
NPP 4.1 conclusion - whether reasonable steps were taken to secure the personal
information
Commissioner found that Multicard failed to implement a number of basic website
security measures which would have been reasonable
in the circumstances to
protect the personal information contained in the upload folder, including:
restricting
access to the uploads folder to authorised and authenticated users
directory browsing, and
configuring its website to request search robots not to index the uploads
Therefore, the Commissioner found that Multicard contravened
NPP 4.1 by failing to take reasonable security steps to protect the personal
information it held from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access,
modification or disclosure.
Disclosure of personal information (NPP 2.1)
part of the investigation, the Commissioner considered whether there had been a
breach of NPP 2.1 in relation to the publication
of the MISC information online
by Multicard. NPP 2.1 regulates the use and disclosure of personal information
and states that organisations
may only use or disclose personal information for
the primary purpose of collection, unless an exception applies.
In general terms, an organisation ‘discloses’
information when it releases information, whether purposely or accidentally, to
others outside the organisation.
The Commissioner found that:
Multicard made
the uploads folder publicly accessible online, and
the personal
information contained in the uploads folder was accessed and acquired by
unauthorised third parties.
Accordingly, the Commissioner found that
Multicard had ‘disclosed’ the MSIC information within the meaning of
The primary purpose for the collection of the MSIC information was to enable
Multicard to process applications for and issue MSICs.
Multicard advised that
the MSIC information was made accessible as the result of a ‘configuration
error’. The Commissioner
found that the purpose for that disclosure was
not related to the primary purpose of the collection of the information, or a
permissible
secondary purpose.
Accordingly, the Commissioner found that the online public accessibility of
the MSIC information was a disclosure in breach of NPP
Rectification
Commissioner found that the steps that Multicard took to contain the breach were
appropriate. After being notified of the breach,
Multicard temporarily disabled
the MSIC website, restricted access to the uploads folder, and requested Google
to clear all relevant
However, the Commissioner expressed concerns about the sufficiency of
Multicard’s initial internal investigation into the breach
(see below).
During the course of the investigation, Multicard took or committed to a
number of steps to prevent further breaches. In June 2013,
Multicard advised the
Commissioner that it had taken the following steps:
directory browsing as a default on all its web servers.
Implemented
access controls so that the MSIC information can only be accessed by authorised
Implemented an
automatic alert notification system to inform the Multicard system administrator
of unusual or anomalous traffic on
the Multicard website.
also advised that it was in the process of separating its public website and the
MISC system onto separate servers, with
the MISC system available only to
authenticated users, and subject to higher security.
In January 2014, Multicard advised that it had undertaken additional
remediation steps, including:
extensive website scanning, penetration testing and remediation over the course
of September 2013 – January 2014
establishing
regular website security scans
undertaking a
major corporate restructure to increase levels of control, and
engaging an
Australian-based privacy consultancy firm to guide Multicard in responding to
the data breach, including mitigating any
harm to affected
individuals.
Multicard will also take the following steps:
Commission an
external privacy/security auditor to conduct an independent audit of
Multicard’s information holdings and security
systems, including the steps
already taken to rectify and improve security (independent auditor).
Put in place
policies and frameworks to guide the regular conduct of audits of
Multicard’s IT security framework.
Develop and
implement a data breach response plan.
Increase privacy
awareness amongst Multicard staff by providing privacy training, especially in
relation to the reforms to the
that came into force on 12 March
Recommendations
the Commissioner found that Multicard’s immediate response to contain the
data breach was adequate, the Commissioner expressed
concern that
Multicard’s initial internal investigation into the breach, and the pace
of that investigation, was insufficient.
In particular, the Commissioner noted
that Multicard’s communications with the OAIC suggested that Multicard did
understand its obligations under the
. Further, Multicard
did not demonstrate to the OAIC that its investigation addressed major questions
regarding the breach, even after
they were raised by the OAIC. Multicard took
almost 12 months to provide clear information on the personal information that
was compromised
by the data breach, and the number of individuals affected.
However, the Commissioner noted that, in December 2013, Multicard significantly
changed its attitude to the investigation, taking a more positive and
cooperative approach.
The Commissioner also expressed concern that Multicard did not appropriately
investigate who and why third parties downloaded or otherwise
accessed the
uploads folder. This information would have informed Multicard’s risk
assessment of the breach and facilitated
the mitigation of that risk.
The Commissioner recommended that Multicard undertake this investigation as
part of finalising its rectification steps, and that it
provide the OAIC with a
copy of its final investigation report.
The Commissioner has requested that the independent auditor engaged by
Multicard certify Multicard has implemented the planned remediation
provide to the OAIC the certification and a copy of the independent
auditor’s report on Multicard’s information
holdings and security
systems by 30 June 2014. This will help ensure that Multicard is well placed to
comply with its obligations
, including the Australian
Commissioner found that Multicard:
failed to take
reasonable steps to ensure the security of the personal information that it
held, in contravention of NPP 4.1, and
personal information other than for a permitted purpose, in contravention of NPP
Multicard acted appropriately to contain the data breach by
immediately disabling its website and restricting access.
However, the Commissioner was concerned that Multicard’s initial
internal investigation did not address major questions regarding
the breach and
did not respond to the OAIC’s requests in a timely fashion.
Since the data breach, Multicard has taken a number of steps to improve its
information security and is in the process of addressing
many of the
OAIC’s recommendations.
Based on the information from Multicard about its remediation of the data
breach, and Multicard’s ongoing implementation of
recommendations made by
the OAIC, the Commissioner decided to close the investigation.
