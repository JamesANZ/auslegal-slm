Electricity; Unlawful
The landlord’s application is dismissed because it is lacking in
substance for two independent reasons:
on a finding of fact that the only
agreement between the parties was for an extra $10 per week for electricity to
be paid by the tenant,
which was paid:
the lease was unlawful in its inception to the knowledge of the landlord and is
therefore unenforceable by the landlord against
the tenant.
REASONS FOR DECISION
This case concerns an oral lease of a
garage at the rear of a house occupied by the landlord. The garage had been
renovated to contain
its own showers, stove and hot water but otherwise drew its
power from the supply to the house. The garage had not been approved
occupancy by the Shoalhaven City Council and had not been approved for
residential purposes. There was no dispute between
the parties on these matters
and written advice from the Council was received into
The agreed rent was $70.00 per week with
a further $10 per week towards electricity which was paid by the tenant. The
relationship
between the landlord and the tenant deteriorated and the landlord
served a Notice of Termination on the tenant who duly vacated.
The landlord
asserted that the tenant was liable to pay a greater sum then $10 per week for
his share of the electricity and the
agreed $10 per week was an interim
agreement only until it became apparent what the actual level of use
The landlord lodged an application on 2
November 2001 seeking the payment of outstanding electricity charges to the flat
for the period
12 July to 16 October 2001 being $401.87 less the amount of
$150.00 paid by the tenant in the form of his $10 per week contributions,
leaving a balance of $251.87. The application alleged that the tenant occupied
the converted garage from 12 July to 24 October 2001.
There was no disagreement
as to the existence of the electricity accounts or the term of the
tenant’s occupation.
The matter was listed for hearing before
a differently constituted Tribunal at Nowra on 28 November 2001. Ms Crane
appeared for the
landlord and the tenant appeared in person. Prior to the
hearing the landlord had sent to the Tribunal a copy of an electricity account
from Integral Energy for the period 17 October – 13 November 2001 in the
sum of $114.70. The Tribunal adjourned the matter
annotation:
Landlord to provide evidence that
tenant’s former premises are separately metered from main house on the
same block."
The matter was then re-listed for hearing
at Nowra before the presently constituted Tribunal on 13 December 2001 and the
agent affirmed the above factual matters and pressed the claim
for the additional electricity charges. The tenant said that the electricity
charges demanded of him were excessive and that the agreed $10.00 per week was a
fair estimate and was consistent with the electricity
use by the previous tenant
of the flat. He said he did not know why the electricity was of the order
demanded by the landlord or
whether it fact it was due to his usage or the usage
in the main house. The tenant said he was away for substantial periods of
and little electricity would have been used at these times. The
landlord’s agent advanced the hypothesis that the tenant must
have left an
electrical heater on or something equivalent in power use. There was no evidence
to support this conjecture on the landlord’s
The tenant said that the landlord in fact
cut off the power to the garage prior to his vacation of the premises. The
agent admitted this and said it was done by the landlord
personally on advice from the Department of Fair Trading. No evidence was
support this assertion.
The Tribunal was satisfied that the
landlord purported to confer on the tenant a right to the exclusive occupancy of
the garage for
a determined rent and thus had purported to create a residential
tenancy agreement within the meaning of the Act. The absence of
any written
agreement does not operate to deny to the existence of the residential tenancy
agreement (see the definition of "residential
tenancy agreement" in section 3
and authorities on the point at [2.3.4] "
Residential Tenancies Law and
Practice in NSW
" Anforth, Thawley and Christensen, 2001
Initially this matter had been listed for
hearing on the issue of whether the tenant was liable for electricity charges in
circumstances
where the garage was not separately metered from the house. If the
matter were to be determined on this issue then the Tribunal would
find that the
landlord had no right to levy these charges. The tenant’s obligation to
pay for electricity is to be found in
clause 5.1 of the prescribed residential
tenancy agreement which applies to oral agreements by virtue of sections 8 and 9
Residential Tenancies Act 1987
and Schedule 1
Residential Tenancies
(Residential Premises) Act 1995.
The Tribunal has consistently interpreted
this obligation as being limited to electricity consumed by the tenant in the
leased premises
and has taken the view that if it is not possible to determine
the extent of the tenant’s consumption of power then no obligation
on the tenant by virtue of clause 5.1. Thus if the premises are not separately
metered such that the tenant’s consumption
cannot be ascertained by
anything other than an estimate, then the landlord’s right to
reimbursement is not to be found in
clause 5.1 (see the cases annotated at
Residential Tenancies Law and Practice in NSW
" Anforth, Thawley
and Christensen, 2001 ed). This does not mean that the landlord may not acquire
a right to levy a charge for electricity
from another source, namely by an
express agreement with the tenant on the issue. Section 19
Residential
Tenancies Act 1987
provides that electricity charges are not charges which
must be paid by the landlord and thus an agreement with the tenant for the
tenant to pay some monies towards electricity would not be inconsistent with
or clause 5.1 (
Kaye –v-P.L. Dyce P/L RT
. In the present case such an agreement existed and required the
tenant to pay $10 per week towards the joint power account, which
he did. The
Tribunal did not accept the assertion by the landlord that this was to be an
interim arrangement only. At best this was
the landlord’s unilateral
understanding or intention and it was never one shared by the tenant. The only
common understanding
which existed was that the tenant pay $10 per week towards
power. The sum of $10 per week was admitted to be consistent with the
the previous tenant of the garage and even if the joint accounts for the garage
and house during the present tenant’s
occupation were found to be higher
than those of the previous tenancy, it would be pure speculation as to who or
what was responsible
for this increase.
The tenant raised the issue of the
landlord’s conduct in disconnecting his power. The landlord’s agent
admitted this conduct
and said that the action was carried out on the advice of
the Department of Fair Trading. On the assumption that a residential tenancy
agreement existed, a disconnection of power by a landlord is a flagrant breach
of the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment
(section 22
Residential
Tenancies Act 1987
) which sounds in damages pursuant to
Residential Tenancies Act 1987
On this particular occasion there was no
application by the tenant before the Tribunal for such an order and so no
compensation was
awarded. The Tribunal totally rejects the assertion that the
officers of the Department of Fair Trading proffered such advice. The
frequently hears assertions by wrong doers (both landlords and tenants) that
their actions were based on advice from the
Department of Fair Trading. Such
assertions have extended to rent strikes, forced lockouts, seizure for goods for
rent distress and
other patently unlawful activity. Even if such advice were
given by the Department (which is totally rejected) it would not constitute
defence in proceedings inter parties.
In the alternate to the finding at
paragraph 8 above to the effect that the garage and house were not separately
metered and that
the only agreement between the parties was for the $10.00per
week which the tenant in fact paid, the Tribunal dealt with the case
Residential Tenancies Act 1987
It is a term of every residential tenancy
agreement on the part of the landlord that there is not any legal impediment (of
landlord had or ought reasonably to have had knowledge at the time of
entering into the agreement) to occupation of the residential
premises as a
residence for the period of the tenancy.
The landlord’s agent admitted that
the landlord was aware that the garage had not been approved by the local
council for occupation
as a residence. For the reasons set out at [2.16.13]
Residential Tenancies Law and Practice in NSW
" Anforth, Thawley and
Christensen, 2001 ed the Tribunal took the view that the lease was unlawful in
its inception to the knowledge
of the landlord and was therefore unenforceable
by the landlord against the tenant. If the lease is unenforceable by the
against the tenant then so is each term of the lease including any
alleged agreement that the tenant would pay the higher electricity
contended for by the landlord.
The Tribunal rejected the
landlord’s claim on two independent bases:
on a finding of fact that the only
agreement between the parties was for an extra $10 per week for power to be paid
by the tenant,
which was paid:
lease was unlawful in its inception to the knowledge of the landlord and is
therefore unenforceable by the landlord against
the tenant.
The Tribunal would add the observations
that if the landlord’s claim had not been dismissed for the above reasons
then it was
bound to afford the tenant the opportunity to lodge and pursue his
own claim for breach of quiet enjoyment which, on the admission
landlord’s agent, was bound to succeed. It is most likely that the measure
of damages the tenant would have recovered
from his action by reason of the high
handed and unlawful actions of the landlord would have exceeded the $251.00 the
landlord sought
for additional electricity. In the circumstances the dismissal
of the landlord’s claim may in fact have been in the landlord’s
interest in bringing the total litigation process to an
