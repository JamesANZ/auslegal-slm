[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
The applicant, Daniel Bredal, was convicted after a trial by jury of using a
carriage service to transmit communications to a person
whom he believed was
under 16 years, intending to facilitate sexual activity, contrary to s 474.27(1)
of the Criminal Code (Cth).
He appealed against his conviction and sought an
order for acquittal.
The appeal alleged that Allen DCJ misdirected the jury on the element of
belief as to age. The issue had been authoritatively resolved
[2025] NSWCCA 38.
The Crown accepted that the appeal ought be allowed and
the conviction quashed, but submitted that a re-trial should be ordered rather
than an acquittal.
The Crown case relied on undercover police posing online as an underage
teenage girl. The applicant engaged in sexualised chats over
several weeks and
arranged, but later cancelled, a meeting. He gave evidence that he believed the
chats were adult roleplay, ended
underage, and denied any intention to meet.
He was convicted on 24 May 2023 and sentenced to 1 year and 7 months
imprisonment, released immediately on a three-year recognisance
Crimes Act 1914
(Cth). A Crown appeal against sentence was
dismissed. The applicant filed his notice of appeal on 22 May 2025. The only
issue was whether the Court should order a re-trial or direct an
The Court held
(Adamson JA, Chen and Coleman JJ agreeing)
the appeal:
(1) The entry of an acquittal and the ordering of a new
trial are true alternatives. A direction for acquittal necessarily usurps
discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions: [21].
(2) A direction for acquittal may be ordered where a
sentence has been fully served or where a fair trial is no longer possible,
where the evidence is sufficiently cogent to justify conviction, a re-trial
should be ordered unless the interests of justice
require otherwise:
(3) Whether an acquittal or re-trial should be ordered
depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case: [24].
(4) The jury’s verdict was not unreasonable, the error
did not affect the quality of the Crown case, and there was no undue
offence and its consequences, including reporting obligations under the
Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000
(NSW), were significant:
(5) Whether the applicant ought be subjected to a re-trial
is a matter for the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions
interests of justice do not favour a direction of an acquittal by this Court:

: Daniel Bredal (the applicant) was convicted of an offence of using a
carriage service to transmit communications to someone whom
he believed to be
under 16 years of age, with the intention of making it easier to procure the
recipient to engage in sexual activity
with himself, contrary to
s 474.27(1) of the Criminal Code
(Cth) (the offence). He seeks an
extension of time for leave to appeal against that conviction, that the appeal
be allowed, that his
conviction be set aside and that an order be made directing
his acquittal of the offence.
basis on which the applicant’s conviction was challenged was that
Allen DCJ (the trial judge) misdirected the jury as to
the element that the
appellant believed the recipient was under the age of 16 years. It was common
ground that the legal issue raised
had been authoritatively resolved in
[2025] NSWCCA 38
). Accordingly, the Crown accepted
that time ought be extended, leave to appeal granted and that the appeal against
conviction ought
be allowed. However, the Crown submitted that this Court ought
order a re-trial of the applicant for the offence rather than direct
Crown case was based on evidence obtained by the NSW Police Force’s Child
Exploitation Internet Unit (the Unit). Officers
of the Unit assumed online
identities (AOI) with a view to engaging in internet chats for the purpose of
detecting exploitation of
children on the internet.
evidence in the prosecution case was that the particular AOI created by police
when communicating with the applicant used the
name “CF”. The
applicant used the name “Wellhello” on Chatiw on 26 November 2021
and “Dan” on
communications on Skype between 26 November 2021 and 14
December 2021. The AOI purported to be an underage teenage girl and sent
photograph of a female image to the applicant. The “chats” between
the AOI and the applicant were sexual in nature.
The communications which
comprised the chats were tendered in the Crown case. They showed that, although
a meeting had been arranged,
the applicant called off the meeting and the chat
15 December 2021, the police arrested and charged the applicant with the
offence. They seized devices on the applicant’s
premises but did not find
any child abuse material or other evidence of sexual interest in children.
defence case, based on the applicant’s evidence, was that he had engaged
in the online internet chats because he was lonely,
having been separated from
his former partner, although they still lived in the same residence with his
three children. He worked
for the Department of Communities and Justice. He said
that he used Chatiw in 2021 because he was looking for friendship and was
the impression that it was an adult-oriented site. He said that he was not
guided by a user’s stated age as such information
was “generally not
factual”. There were instances on Chatiw where he engaged in fantasy or
to his conversations with the AOI, the applicant said that he never intended to
meet up with her or any other underage teenage
girl and said that he did not
find their chats particularly sexually arousing although there was a
“level of excitement”.
He said that he believed that the AOI was
actually an adult who engaged in role play. He said that, on about 9 December
began to suspect that the AOI was in fact an underage teenage girl and
cancelled the meeting which they had been discussing. The
Crown challenged that
version in cross-examination.
applicant was convicted of the offence on 24 May 2023 following a 6-day trial by
jury. On 20 June 2023, the applicant filed a
notice of intention to appeal his
conviction.
17 November 2023, the trial judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 1
year and 7 months but ordered, pursuant to
Crimes Act 1914
(Cth), that the applicant be released immediately upon entering into a
recognisance, for a period of 3 years. In addition, the applicant
was ordered to
comply with conditions including that he be subject to supervision by a
probation officer and that he participate
in rehabilitation programs as
directed. He was also subject to a restriction on travelling outside the State.
Each of these restrictions
had a duration of 2 years.
Crown appeal against sentence on the ground of manifest inadequacy was

The Crown’s application for
special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused on 8 August 2024:

applicant filed his notice of appeal against conviction on 22 May 2025 (and thus
needed an extension of time).
The relief sought
only remaining issue in the appeal is whether this Court ought order a re-trial
or direct an acquittal.
Woods, who appeared for the applicant, submitted that, in circumstances where
the applicant had served much of his sentence, this
Court ought direct an
acquittal rather than order a re-trial. He relied on affidavit evidence, in
which the applicant deposed as
to the stress and cost of the proceedings to date
(including the Crown’s unsuccessful application for special leave to
to the High Court against the dismissal by this Court of the Crown appeal
against sentence). He relied on the applicant’s affidavit
evidence that he
suffered extreme stress as a result of the Crown appeal against sentence, is no
longer employed, cannot secure a
job and is relying on “rapidly dwindling
savings”. The applicant deposed that he has lost his social standing and
no longer participate in the activities in which his children engage. As a
result of his mental state, he has contemplated suicide
and been admitted to a
psychiatric ward for a 24-hour monitoring period. He shares the care of his
children, each of whom have been
diagnosed with a mental condition.
Woods submitted that, in all the circumstances, it would be oppressive, not be
in the interests of justice and serve no good purpose
for the applicant to have
to be brought to trial again. He also submitted that if the Court were not to
order a re-trial, this would
not usurp the discretion of the Director of Public
Prosecutions (Cth) (the Director). For the reasons given below, I reject this
submission.
The relevant statutory provisions
Criminal Appeal Act
(NSW) confers a right of appeal
against conviction on a question of law alone
(s 5(1)(a))
or otherwise, if leave
is granted.
Court’s power to make orders when it allows an appeal against a conviction
derives from
Criminal Appeal Act
relevantly provides for a situation (unlike this case) where an appeal against
conviction is allowed because the verdict is unreasonable:
that is, that it was
not open to the tribunal of fact to find the accused guilty beyond reasonable
relevantly provides:
6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases
(1) The court on any appeal under
(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that
the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground
unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence ...
(2) Subject to the special provisions of this
Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under
section 5(1)
conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal
to be entered.
Woods confirmed that he did not seek to argue that the jury’s verdict of
guilty was unreasonable. Indeed, there is no such
ground of appeal.
Criminal Appeal Act
relevantly provides:
8 Power of court to grant new trial
(1) On an appeal against a conviction on
indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of
the appellant,
order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court
considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having
all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately
remedied by an order for a new trial than by
any other order which the court is
empowered to make.
entry of a verdict of acquittal under
and the ordering of a new trial under
are, in respect of a single charge, true alternatives. In
Spies v The
(2000) 201 CLR 603
[2000] HCA 43
, the High Court (Gaudron, McHugh,
Gummow and Hayne JJ) said at [104]:
Unless the interests of justice require the entry of an acquittal, an appellate
court should ordinarily order a new trial of a charge
where a conviction in
respect of that charge has been set aside but there is evidence to support the
charge. In the present case,
given the competing considerations, it cannot be
said that the interests of justice require that the appellant be acquitted of
s 229(4) charge. That being so, it is a matter for the prosecuting
authority to determine whether in all the circumstances there
should be a
further trial of the s 229(4) charge.
proposition that the Court must either order an acquittal or order a new trial
was approved in
The Queen v A2
(2019) 269 CLR 507
[2019] HCA 35
(Kiefel CJ and Keane J) as follows:
, Ipp A-JA, referring to
(1), said that these
provisions “do not empower the court to order that no new trial should be
held. Nor do they empower the
court to quash the conviction and make no other
order.” The view that these provisions present the only alternatives where
an appeal against conviction on indictment is allowed is consistent with
statements by members of this Court in
R v Taufahema
that “[t]he
question is whether an order for a new trial is a more adequate remedy for the
flaws in that trial than an order
for an acquittal” and in
Spies v The
that “[i]f this Court were now to refuse to order a new trial of
that charge, the appellant would be acquitted of all charges”.
(Footnotes omitted.)
follows that the direction of an acquittal necessarily usurps the discretion of
the Director. I reject Mr Woods’ submission
to the contrary.
direction of an acquittal is not limited to circumstances where a verdict of
guilty is unreasonable. An acquittal has been directed
in other circumstances,
(1) where a sentence has been fully served: see the summary of authorities in
R v Pedrana
[2001] NSWCCA 66
(2001) 123 A Crim R 1
AJA, Wood CJ at CL agreeing (ordering an acquittal); Simpson J
who would have ordered a re-trial); and
(2) where a fair trial is no longer possible: see the discussion of the
authorities in
Mokbel v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth)
[2021] VSCA
(2021) 289 A Crim R 1
(Beach and Osborn JJA) (where the
majority ordered a re-trial in circumstances where the Director of Public
Prosecutions indicated
that she did not propose to prosecute the appellant
as in the present case, the evidence is sufficiently cogent evidence to justify
a conviction, a re-trial ought be ordered unless
it is in the interests of
justice to order an acquittal:
[2012] NSWCCA 131
(2012) 224 A
) at [648]–[660] (McClellan CJ at CL) (in which
McClellan CJ at CL would have ordered a re-trial but, the majority, Fullerton
and Garling JJ, ordered an acquittal). The statement of principles in
was applied in
(2020) 102 NSWLR 467
[2020] NSWCCA 142
where a re-trial was ordered by majority (Beech-Jones J at [93]-[96], N Adams J
agreeing, Payne JA
, who would have ordered an acquittal).
decisions of this Court indicate that the question whether an acquittal ought be
directed or whether a re-trial ought be ordered
(thus leaving it to the Director
to determine, in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion whether to bring the
applicant to trial
again) depends on the facts and circumstances of the subject
case and that minds can reasonably differ as to the outcome.
my view, this is not a case where it would be appropriate for this Court to
direct an acquittal. As Mr Woods accepted, the jury’s
verdict was not
unreasonable. The nature of the error (a direction which was in a form
subsequently found by this Court in
to be erroneous) did not affect
the nature or the quality of the evidence in support of the Crown case. There is
no suggestion of
the Crown improving its position on a re-trial since its
evidence can be expected to be the same as in the first trial. Nor is there
undue delay, although I accept that, to the applicant, the period over which
this has been hanging over his head must seem very
no custodial sentence was imposed, the restrictions to which the applicant is
subject as a result of the sentence would, but
for the quashing of the
conviction, continue until 16 November 2026. Further, the fact of a conviction
of the offence is of considerable
importance. Apart from other consequences, it
is a Class 2 offence under Sch 1B of the
Child Protection (Offenders
Registration) Act 2000
(NSW) and therefore a conviction for that offence
attracts reporting requirements. This matter is significant for the purpose of
the community.
ceiling principle would apply, which means that, if the applicant were re-tried
and convicted, a sentence more serious than the
one which was imposed could not
be imposed:
[2023] NSWSC 611
, referring to
(1979) 1 A Crim R 416
at 419-420. Thus, the applicant would not be
subjected to the risk of a custodial term being imposed were he to be convicted
the applicant ought be subjected to a re-trial is, in my view, pre-eminently a
matter for the discretion of the Director.
None of the factors to which I have
referred ought be construed as an attempt to influence the Director in deciding
whether to re-try
the applicant, since this is a matter which, in my view, falls
entirely within the Director’s discretion in the circumstances
present case. I am not persuaded that the interests of justice favour the
direction of an acquittal by this Court.
Proposed orders
the reasons given above, I propose the following orders:
(1) Extend the time for filing of the notice of appeal to 22 May 2025.
(2) Grant leave to appeal.
(3) Allow the appeal against conviction.
(4) Set aside the conviction.
(5) Order that there be a re-trial.
(6) The matter is remitted to the District Court arraignment list on 14 November
2025 at 9.30am.
