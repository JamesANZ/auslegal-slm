REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is a preliminary jurisdiction hearing in a joint application filed under the
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003
(“the MHRPA”)
by residents of Nestle Inn Tourist Village, Tingalpa (“the Park”),
who own eight dwellings respectively
which are positioned in the Park. The
applicants seek the provision to them by the park owner of site agreements under
The respondent park owner, Mariner Leisure Management Limited (Under
External Admininstration), pleads in its defence that the applicants’
hear the application.
The evidence
parties have agreed that the question of jurisdiction should be determined on
the papers on the basis of reports as to the physical
characteristics of the
applicants’ homes provided by Ms Demaj, an investigator from the Office of
Fair Trading, and by Mr Soden,
a consulting engineer; and on the basis of
Inspection Certificates provided to the Brisbane City Council by Mr Hoskins, an
Mr Hoskins has stated, and the Tribunal accepts, that Mr Hoskins has
no familiarity with the definition of “
manufactured home
under the MHRPA and his inspections and subsequent reports were for the purpose
of assessing the subject structures against
Building Act
Amendment Act
and the Building Code of Australia. Ms Demaj has attached to her
reports detailed photographs of the exterior, interior and underneath
each subject structure taken during her inspections in January 2009.
Hoskins’s Inspection Certificates provide detailed measurements and
descriptions of all except one (site 2E) of the subject
structures. He found in
each case that there was an integrated structure consisting of a caravan
connected to an “
annex built framed construction
Demaj’s conclusion in each of her assessment reports was that one section
of the integrated structure which constitutes each
applicant’s home
appeared to be a “
” as defined under the
Residential Tenancies Act 1994
(“the RTA”), and that another
” meet the definition of “
manufactured
of the MHRPA. She recommended in each case that
an independent engineering report be obtained. The reports of Mr Soden, whom
Tribunal accepts as an independent expert, were subsequently obtained.
Soden found that the tie-downs and connections of the integrated structure in
each case indicated that the structure was relocatable;
and he reached the
conclusion that the integrated structure in each case contained a combination of
a caravan and an annex which

in addition, a carport.
Relevant statutory provisions
manufactured home
” is defined in
of the MHRPA in
the following terms:
“10 What is a manufactured home
manufactured home
is a structure, other than a caravan or tent,
(a) has the character of a dwelling house; and
(b) is designed to be able to be moved from one position to another;
(c) is not permanently attached to land.”
” is defined in Schedule Two of the MHRPA by
reference to the definition in the RTA.
of the RTA is in the
following terms:
“3A Caravan
(a) designed principally for residential purposes; and
(b) designed to be attached to and towed by a self-propelled vehicle;
(c) that, as originally designed, was capable of being registered under a
law of the State about the use of vehicles on public roads.
(a) not fitted with wheels; and
(b) not designed for permanent attachment to land but designed for
attachment to a motor vehicle and for use for residential purposes.
In addition, a
self-propelled vehicle—
(i) is designed to be used both as a vehicle and for residential
purposes; or
(ii) was designed to be used solely as a vehicle but has been modified to
be suitable for use both as a vehicle and for residential
purposes; and
(b) that, as originally designed, was capable of being registered under a
law of the State about the use of vehicles on public roads.”
Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr Hoskins and Mr Soden as to the physical
characteristics of each subject structure. Each structure
includes a section,
which was originally a caravan, connected to an annex, with both the caravan
section and the annex being relocatable
and not permanently attached to land.
Each dwelling in the Tribunal’s view is no longer a trailer or a caravan,
but has become
functionally one structure. The Tribunal therefore finds that
each subject structure is an integrated residential structure which
the requirements in parts (a), (b) and (c) of the
definition of
manufactured home

respondent argues however that each subject structure cannot fall within the
definition of “
manufactured home
” because a manufactured home
is a structure “
other then a caravan
”, whereas here each
subject structure is, in part, a modified caravan. The respondent claims in
effect that if a structure
which would otherwise fall within the definition of
manufactured home
” has a modified caravan attached to it,
then the structure ceases to fall within the definition.
respondent’s argument gives rise to the question as to whether each
subject structure is a “

the RTA. Each structure is not “

of the RTA, and in the light of the District Courts

structure does not fall within that category of the definition. The remaining
issue is whether the structures are “
” in terms of
the definition in
section 3A(1).

originally a caravan together with an
annex attached to the side of the caravan,

his judgment, with which Justices Jerrard and Holmes agreed, Justice Keane said
at paragraphs [7]-[16]:
“[7] The premises in which the respondents have lived for
many years comprise a section which was originally a caravan and other
which include an annexe and a deck. The annexe is attached to the side of the
caravan. It is of about the same floor area
as the caravan. The annexe is tied
down by chains to stakes in the ground. The evidence before the Tribunal was to
the effect that
“large structural openings” had been made in the
“north wall” of what was the caravan, so that “the
the [annexe] would... render this caravan non structural for
[8] The Tribunal found as a fact that the annexe and deck have been
integrated into one structure. It held that this structure does
not answer the
definition of a caravan in the MHRP Act. On appeal to the District Court, the
decision of the Tribunal was upheld.
[9] The applicant submitted in this Court that the Tribunal and the
District Court erred in law in failing to conclude that the respondents’
[10] By virtue of the statutory definition of “manufactured
“manufactured home” for the purposes of the regime established by
that legislation. The applicant pointed to the
definition of caravan in
section 3A(1)(c)
Residential Tenancies Act 1994
(Qld) (“the
RTA”) which provides that “a caravan is a trailer... that, as
originally designed, was capable of being
registered under a law of the State
[11] The applicant submitted that “the error of law at the heart of
the appeal is whether the relevant home structure properly
fell within the
definition of a ‘manufactured home’ under the MHRP [Act] or a
‘caravan’ under the [RTA]”.
The applicant urged the
proposition “once a caravan always a caravan irrespective of the
modifications” to it. The
applicant emphasised that the caravan which has
been incorporated into the structure was, as originally designed, a trailer
of being registered as a caravan. For that reason, so the applicant
argues, the respondents’ home cannot be regarded as a
manufactured home.
[12] It is important that the question which the applicant seeks to
agitate before this Court is considered in its factual context
rather than in
the abstract. The dispute between the parties has arisen because of the
respondents’ assertion that they are
entitled to the provision of a site
agreement in respect of their home. It is in the context of this dispute that
one must address
the question whether the structure in which the respondents
live, and in respect of which they assert their claim for a site agreement,
“manufactured home”, that is to say, “a structure other than a
caravan” and which has the other characteristics
required by section 10 of
the MHRP Act. Those other characteristics are not presently in controversy.
The question, therefore,
is whether “the structure” in which the
respondents dwell is a “caravan” under section 3A of the
[13] Crucial to the argument which the applicant sought to advance is the
contention that the learned District Court judge erred in
having regard to the
evidence of the structural changes to the caravan. The applicant stressed that
the structure was originally
designed as a caravan. The applicant argued that
the answer to the question whether a trailer is a caravan is to be determined by
reference to its original design, and that the answer to this question cannot be
affected by “submissive assessments”
of the effect of modification
to a caravan. But the question, having regard to the facts of this case, is not
of one element of the structure in respect of which
the respondents seek a site agreement. It is about the proper description of
the structure.
[14] The MHRP Act does not invite a notional dismantling of the structure
in question, nor does it require some form of historical
inquiry into the
provenance of the components of the structure. The inconvenience of either
approach is obvious, but is not necessary
to have resort to arguments from
inconvenience. It is clear from the language of the statute that the MHRP Act
operates by reference
to the structure
as it exists on site
effect of the legislation fails to be considered.
[15] The applicant’s argument fails to surmount the obstacle that
both the Tribunal and District Court proceeded on the basis
that, as a matter of
fact, the respondents’ home was found to be one integrated residential
structure. There was nothing “subjective”
fact. It was an objective appraisal of the construction and function of the
structure. Considered as one
structure, the respondent’s home does not
meet the definition of a “caravan” within the meaning of the MHRP
As the learned District Court judge held, the structure “is no
longer a trailer at all because of what has happened to it...
Functionally, it
has become one structure...”. This finding of fact is fatal to the
applicant’s argument.
[16] There being no basis for a challenge to the finding of fact which
forms the basis of the decisions below, there is no prospect
that an appeal will
subject dwellings in this case are essentially identical with the dwelling under
consideration in
Monte Carlo

Tribunal finds that the subject dwellings as they exist on site are not

definition of “
