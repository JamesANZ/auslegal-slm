RESIDENTIAL PARK AGREEMENT DETAILS

Roslyn Woodfield

14 March 2014
$102.50 per week

$720.00 was paid by the tenant and lodged with the Commissioner of Consumer
and Business Services (Bond No. 7001642-X)
Sworn or affirmed evidence was given by
The owners: Robert Browney & Karen Browney
The resident: Roslyn Woodfield
The resident’s witnesses: Mr Woodfield, Ray Young, Anthony Smith &
Sue Osborne
Ms Woodfield is a resident in the Kadina Caravan Park (the Park) and has
lived there since December 2012. She rents a site in the
Park and has placed her
own dwelling on that site. The agreement for the rental of the site is an
agreement under the
Residential Parks Act 2007
On 19 October 2014 Ms Woodfield received a notice of termination which gave
her 90 days’ notice to vacate the Park.
Ms Woodfield would prefer to stay in the Park and seeks an order from the
Tribunal permitting her to remain.
The basis of her application is that the notice of termination served by the
park owners is invalid because it was served in retaliation
for her taking
action to stand up for her rights as a park resident.
The application is disputed by the park owners.
The evidence and submissions of the parties at the hearing
The evidence and submissions of the resident
Ms Woodfield gave evidence that:-
She has lived in
the Park for some time without any problems;
Once the park
owners took over the running of the Park from the previous park owner, they
started harassing her and “made her
life hell”;
The park owners
are in breach of the Act in a number of respects;
They have banned
a friend of hers from visiting the Park and that was unreasonable and
Letters from
various other residents in the Park state that they have no complaint against Ms
She had been
involved in a number of disagreements with the park owners and on one particular
occasion she said that they were responsible
for her right to “peace
comfort and privacy” which was denied;
Shortly after
that she was served with the notice of termination;
She has not been
engaged in the kinds of activities accused of by the park owners;
She is concerned
whom are elderly);
unreasonable to expect her to sell her dwelling within the time permitted.
Ms Woodfield called other residents of the Park who gave evidence
generally in support of her statements to the Tribunal.
The evidence and submissions of the park owners
Mr and Mrs Browney gave evidence that:-
The notice was
not retaliatory and Ms Woodfield had never “taken action” to secure
or enforce her rights – they
denied that she had ever used words to them
such as said that they were responsible for her right to “peace comfort
and privacy;
There had been a
number of complaints about Ms Woodfield’s conduct in the Park;
They submitted a
letter from the former park owner about the disruptive behaviour of Ms
They referred to
a diary of incidents concerning Ms Woodfield since they had been the park
Conclusions and findings
Although Ms Woodfield raised issues relating to the relationship between
other park residents and the park owners, the only application
being considered
by me is her application. If other residents wish to have the Tribunal deal with
any dispute they may have with
the park owners, then they must bring their own
application in the Tribunal.
The park owners have not brought any application to the Tribunal to terminate
the resident’s right to reside there on the basis
of her conduct.
Therefore I will not deal with those issues as part of this application except
as they may be relevant to a consideration
of the resident’s
application.
Is the notice of termination valid?
of the Act allows a park owner to serve a notice of termination to
terminate a site agreement (which is periodic) without giving
any reason for the
termination provided that the notice is in writing and gives 90 days’
notice of the termination
(Section 60
allows a park owner to serve a notice of
termination to terminate a tenancy agreement which is periodic without giving
for the termination provided 60 days’ notice in writing is
of the Act states that if a resident applies to the Tribunal for
relief where the resident has been served with a notice of termination
Tribunal is satisfied that:-
the park owner was wholly or partly motivated to make the
application or give the notice of termination (as the case may be) by action
the resident to complain to a government authority or secure or enforce the
resident’s rights as a resident..”
then the Tribunal may make an order to reinstate the agreement.
Ms Woodfield has a periodic site agreement with the park owners. The notice
of termination served on her by them complies with the
requirements of
of the Act.
The question is whether or not that notice of termination is retaliatory
within the meaning of
of the Act.
My assessment of the evidence is that Ms Woodfield and the park owners have
had a number of disagreements on various occasions. She
may have referred to her
right to quiet enjoyment or used words to that effect.
However, in my view that is not enough for
to apply. Ms Woodfield
has taken no “action” to secure or enforce her rights. She has
merely complained to the park owner.
I consider that in order for Ms Woodfield
to claim the benefit of
she would have had to initiate positive
action to “secure or enforce” her rights such as contacting her
local Member
of Parliament, arranging a petition or a meeting or residents or
engaging a solicitor to negotiate with the park owners on her behalf.
consider that merely complaining to the park owners constitutes taking such
Therefore I find that the notice of termination is not retaliatory and I
conclude that it is valid.
The final outcome
After making this view known to the parties at the hearing there was some
discussion about the fairness of the vacation date in the
notice. I informed the
parties that t despite the strict compliance of the notice with the requirements
of the Act, I did not consider
it was fair for Ms Woodfield to have to remove
her dwelling with only 90 days’ notice.
After some discussion it was agreed that Ms Woodfield would vacate the Park
by 30 January 2015 but the dwelling could remain on the
site up to Tuesday 31
March 2014 (if not sold beforehand).
The parties were unable to agree about rent.
I have decided that I will exercise my powers under
Section 116(1)(d)
Act to modify the agreement so as to reduce the rent for the period from 30
January 2015 until the first to occur of the removal
of the dwelling from the
site or Tuesday 31 March 2015. I consider this to be fair in all the
circumstances.
