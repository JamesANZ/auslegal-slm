[2021] SASCFC 39
Judgment of The Full Court
(ex tempore)
(The Honourable President Livesey, the
Honourable Justice Bleby and the Honourable Justice S David)
21 September 2021
PROFESSIONS AND TRADES - LAWYERS - COMPLAINTS AND DISCIPLINE -
The Commissioner seeks an order that the respondent’s name be struck
off the roll of practitioners pursuant to s 89(1b) or
Practitioners Act 1981
(SA). While the respondent retired from practice on 30
June 2017, his name remains on the roll of practitioners.
The application is made with the consent of the respondent on the basis of
medical evidence which demonstrates that the respondent
is no longer fit to
practise the profession of the law. The medical evidence was provided to the
Commissioner in support of the respondent’s
application to stay
disciplinary proceedings brought against him by the Commissioner in the Legal
Profession Disciplinary Tribunal.
Held (by the Court), allowing the application and striking the
respondent’s name from the roll of practitioners:
1. Whilst this Court retains a discretion to proceed on the papers in
private, striking off is a matter of public interest and transparency
Court’s determination of matters such as these is important.
2. While the Court possesses an inherent jurisdiction to strike a legal
practitioner’s name from the roll on a practitioner’s
application, the Court may decline to make that order where the public interest
requires that the Court exercise its disciplinary
3. It is undesirable to proceed on a practitioner’s application for
removal where there remain unresolved proceedings in the
Legal Practitioners
Disciplinary Tribunal.

LEGAL PROFESSION CONDUCT COMMISSIONER v
[2021] SASCFC 39
Full Court: Livesey P, Bleby and David JJ
(ex tempore)
1 The Commissioner seeks an order that the name of the practitioner,
Janusz Kaminski, be struck off the roll of legal practitioners
pursuant to
Legal Practitioners Act 1981
2 The application is made with the consent of the practitioner on the basis
of medical evidence which demonstrates that the practitioner
is no longer fit to
practise the profession of the law.
3 The Court convenes today as the Full Court rather than the Court of Appeal
pursuant to r 11.1(6)(b) of the
Uniform Civil Rules 2020
4 This application arises out of various Tribunal proceedings which
commenced in 2016 in which allegations were made to the effect
practitioner had misappropriated trust monies. In one of those matters, the
practitioner admitted certain facts and accepted
that the conduct constituted
unsatisfactory professional conduct, but not professional misconduct. Speaking
generally, however,
the Tribunal has not conducted an inquiry into any of these
matters and no findings have been made.
5 During 2019, the practitioner sought an order permanently staying
the Tribunal proceedings on the basis of medical evidence which
demonstrated very severe impairment of general intellectual functioning, likely
the result of moderately advanced Parkinson’s
dementia, described as a
progressive disorder possibly associated with concurrent vascular dementia.
Further deterioration is expected.
In response to this evidence, the
Commissioner questioned the practitioner’s fitness to practice.
6 During the latter part of 2019, the practitioner’s then solicitors
advised the Commissioner that the practitioner would be
prepared to consent
to his name being struck from the roll of legal practitioners on the basis of
the medical evidence. There were
then further delays whilst the
practitioner’s instructions were formalised and, earlier this year,
medical evidence was obtained
to demonstrate that the practitioner retained the
capacity to consent to his name being struck from the roll of legal
practitioners.
The practitioner is no longer represented.
7 The practitioner is now 73 years of age and was first admitted to practice
in South Australia on 1 May 1989. He retired from practice
on 30 June 2017 and
now resides in Victoria.
8 Whether a disciplinary proceeding under s 89 of the Act, or the exercise
of the Court’s inherent jurisdiction recognised
by s 88A of the Act,
proceedings such as these are commenced pursuant to r 261 of the
Civil Rules 2020
(SA). By r 261.2, the Court has a discretion to
determine an application and make orders in chambers on the basis of affidavit
and written submissions. Alternatively, it may convene a hearing. By
r 261.3(4), a similar procedure applies where a strike off
order is by
9 Whilst this Court retains a discretion to proceed on the papers in
private, striking off is a matter of public interest. Transparency
Court’s consideration and determination of matters such as these is

11 A legal practitioner’s name may be struck from the roll for reasons
other than proved misconduct. Where a practitioner
is suffering from a mental
illness or has lost intellectual faculties by reason of
or physical
it may be appropriate to
strike a practitioner’s name from the roll if the practitioner is no
longer fit to practise.
12 The primary objective of the Commissioner and
of this Court is the protection of the public. For so long as the
practitioner’s
name remains on the roll, he is effectively held out as
being fit to practise the profession of the law. Though he has retired,

practitioner’s name from the roll on a practitioner’s
application, for example because the practitioner wishes to
the Court may decline to
make that order if the public interest requires that the Court exercise its
disciplinary jurisdiction, particularly
where this may result in additional or
other orders.
In addition, it is, in our view, undesirable to
proceed on a practitioner’s application where there remain unresolved
proceedings, as in this case.
14 Having considered the affidavit material and submissions, we are
satisfied that the practitioner is no longer fit to practise
the profession of
the law. The interests of the public and the administration of justice will
best be served by acceding to the
Commissioner’s application and by this
Court making an order. As mentioned, the practitioner does not oppose the
15 Accordingly, the practitioner’s name will be struck from the roll
of legal practitioners kept by this Court. The Commissioner
is to have costs in
the amount of $3,000.
