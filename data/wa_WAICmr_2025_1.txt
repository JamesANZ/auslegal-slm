internal review decision dated 29 February 2024, the agency confirmed its
decision to refuse access to the requested documents.
On 24 April 2024,
the complainant applied to the Information Commissioner (
Commissioner
) for external review of the agency’s
During the external review, the agency gave the complainant an
amended notice of decision, and identified three documents within the
the access application, namely the requested section 58 statement and
attachments (collectively,
the disputed documents
). The agency decided
to give access to an edited copy of the section 58 statement (
), deleting information it claimed was exempt under clause 4(3) of
Schedule 1 to the FOI Act and full access to the attachments to

The agency informed the complainant that,
following consultation under section 33 of the FOI Act, a third party objected

the third party
applied to be joined as a party to this matter, pursuant to section 69(2) of the
FOI Act, and was so joined.
Section 76(1)(b) of the FOI Act provides that
the Commissioner may decide any matter in relation to an access application that
have been decided by the agency. On 8 August 2024, after considering the
material before her, the Commissioner provided the parties
with her preliminary
view. It was the Commissioner’s preliminary view that all information in
the disputed documents is outside
the scope of the complainant’s access
application and that access should be refused to those documents in their
entirety on
that basis.
The complainant did not accept the
Commissioner’s preliminary view and made further submissions. The agency
and third party
also made further submissions.
The complainant advised
in their further submissions that they were not pursuing access to the
attachments to the statement. Therefore,
the Commissioner did not consider the
attachments further and only the statement remained in dispute

Commissioner’s determination.
The Commissioner observed that the
terms in which an access application is framed set the parameters for an
agency’s response
under Part 2 of the FOI Act, and in particular, set the
parameters for the agency to identify which documents come within the scope
the access application and, what information in those documents comes within the
scope of the access application. The Commissioner
noted that an agency is
entitled to delete information from documents that is outside the scope of the
relevant access application:
Re G and Department for Community
Development
[2002] WAICmr 28
, at [15]-[16]. Further, if information is
outside the scope of an access application, it is not necessary to consider
not that information is exempt: see for example,
Re Michel and
Office of Health Review
[2009] WAICmr 33.
The Commissioner had
regard to the terms of the access application and the complainant’s
agreement to the deletion of all commercial
information from the disputed
document. The Commissioner considered that, because of that agreement, all
commercial information
in the disputed document was outside the scope of the
access application and the agency was entitled to refuse access to all
information
of that kind on that basis.
The complainant contended that
the entirety of a section 58 statement does not contain commercial information
and that prescribed
headings in those documents do not consist of commercial
information. Based on her examination of the disputed document, the
Commissioner
was of the view that it was comprised entirely of commercial
information. The Commissioner considered that the document as a whole,
nature, contains commercial information and the headings are part of the context
of the document. The Commissioner also noted
that disclosure of only the
headings in the disputed document would result in the disclosure of a
meaningless document.
As a result, the Commissioner was of the view that
all information in the disputed document fell outside the scope of the
complainant’s
access application. Accordingly, the Commissioner found
that access should be refused to the disputed document in its entirety on
basis and varied the agency’s decision.
