ANTI-DISCRIMINATION TRIBUNAL
No. 42 of 1995
Graziella Ciciulla - COMPLAINANT
Kathleen Curwen-Walker - FIRST NAMED RESPONDENT

REASONS FOR DECISION ON AN APPLICATION FOR COSTS
15 July 1998
Ms Yolanda Klempfner -
How does this matter come before the Tribunal?
On 8 April 1998 this Tribunal handed down its Reasons for Decision on the
hearing of the complaint. It ordered:-
That the Respondents pay to the
Complainant $3,000.00 as compensation for loss of quiet enjoyment in her
employment suffered by the
Complainant in consequence of the acts of
discrimination found by this Tribunal to have been committed by the Respondents.
That the Respondents are jointly and
severally liable for the amount referred to in paragraph
That the sum of $3,000.00 be paid within
30 days of the date of this order.
question of costs is reserved with the liberty to apply.
April the complainant filed a written submission with the Tribunal concerning
the question of costs. On 21 April the Respondents
filed with the Tribunal a
written submission in response.
This complaint is governed by the
Equal Opportunity Act 1984
by virtue of
Section 217 of the
Equal Opportunity Act 1995
. This matter was considered at
length in the Tribunal's Reasons for Decision dated 8 April 1998. Following the
Tribunal's Reasons
for Decision as to costs in the case of
Murphy v Colorific
Lithographics Pty Ltd
(22 January 1997, unreported), the awarding of costs
is part of "dealing" with the complaint and is also governed by the
Opportunity Act 1984
The Legislation
Set out below is the provision of the
relevant to this case.
(1) In any inquiry or proceeding before the Board, the Board may order the
payment of costs fixed by the Board.
(2) In making an order under this section, the Board must, unless there are
special circumstances, fix a sum which reflects the costs
reasonably incurred by
the person in favour of whom the order is made and any other pecuniary loss
incurred by that person because
of the proceedings.
The Tribunal's power to award costs.
The scope of s47 of "the
" was considered in detail in
, cited above. In its Reasons for Decision on an application for costs
Steicke v Swan Hill Rural City Council
(3 April 1998, unreported) the
Tribunal re-iterated that the decisions of the Tribunal and its predecessor, the
Equal Opportunity
Board, are authority for the following propositions.
"The Tribunal has a clear discretion to award or not to award costs. In this
the event. However,
the Tribunal will award costs if the party seeking them can point to a
circumstance (apart from the mere fact
of having won) to justify them. These
circumstances may include (but are not limited to) a situation where a complaint
is vexatious,
or where a complaint, on its face, is not maintainable and the
complainant could have no reasonable ground to believe that it would
succeed. If
costs are awarded, those costs would normally be on a party/party basis,
although in special circumstances a lower (or
perhaps a higher) amount may be
(See generally
Sinnapan v State of Victoria
, EOB of Vic, 24 April
Murphy v Colorific Lithographics Pty Ltd,
ADT of Vic, 22 January
Delmonaco v NRU Worklife Pty Ltd
, ADT of Vic, 3 April 1997;
Spencer v Dowling & Anor
, [1997] 2VR 127).
While the Tribunal clearly has discretion to award costs to a successful
party, it is the well established view of the Tribunal that
this discretion must
be exercised within the spirit of the legislation which has a clear focus on the
protection of human rights
and the encouragement of the disputes being resolved
by conciliation. An order for costs should be made only in cases where such
order is clearly justified in the given circumstance.
Is an order for costs justified in this case?
It is submitted for the complainant that an award of half the costs is
justified because "this was the approximate time dealt with
the issue of the
number of employees employed by the Respondents and that it was unreasonable for
the Respondents to persist in the
The Respondents' submission states that they "always held a bona fide and
strongly held belief that the various businesses used by
them were not
independent contractors within the meaning of the
. It is further submitted
"that given the paucity of precedent in this regard this was not
unreasonable".
The Tribunal acknowledges that prior to the hearing of this case the term
"independent contractors" in section 4(1) of "the
" had received little
interpretation by the Tribunal. The Tribunal is also conscious of the fact that
during the course of the hearing
the Respondents were subjected to unwelcome,
but not unexpected, publicity and close examination of their religious beliefs
and practices
and that conciliation of the matter would have been attractive to
them. The Tribunal accepts that the Respondents' defence was based
on an honest
belief that they had a defensible case.
The Tribunal concludes that no order for costs should be made.
