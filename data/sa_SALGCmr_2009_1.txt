APPLICATION FOR A RESTAURANT LICENCE
PRELIMINARY POINT
This is an application made by
OUTBACK JACKS BAR & GRILL PTY LTD
seeking a restaurant licence in respect of premises situated at
MARINA PIER, GLENELG 5045
, and to be known as
OUTBACK JACKS BAR &
GRILL GLENELG
The application attracted a Notice of Objection from Community Corporation
020425 Inc which was resolved in terms of agreed trading
times in accordance
with the by-laws of the Community Corporation ie:
Cease trade on a Sunday - 11.30 pm
At the request of the applicant, I set down the application for a preliminary
point on the question of whether or not the use of “
the manner proposed in this instance is acceptable to the licensing
I have considered the remarks made by His Honour Judge Hume in the Licensing
Court Decision of
Belair Taverna
delivered on 16 October 1987, at page
“.... The second point is that the name under which a business
holding a liquor licence trades should not be such as to create
an expectation
in the minds of the public that it was able to trade in a manner in which it was
not legally able to trade - for example,
that it is appropriate in the public
interest to allow the holder of a restaurant licence to trade under the name
Bar”. As a matter of broad commonsense there is some
force in this point. .....”
Having regard to the above, this authority has generally taken the position
that use of “
” in respect of restaurant licences is
inappropriate, excepting in circumstances where “
in conjunction with a non-liquor activity for instance “
Sandwich Bar
”, or the like.
Turning to the evidence and submissions presented in support of the
application, the applicant in this instance is the franchisor
of a franchise
restaurant chain, which currently has 10 licensed restaurants operating in
NSW, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.
The advertising and promotion
of the restaurant chain is common.
During the course of the hearing of the preliminary point, the
applicant’s representatives produced the restaurant chain’s
advertising material in the form of photographs of signage of both existing and
the proposed restaurant, being the subject of this
application, menus and also
photographs of various badged merchandise associated with the restaurant
The applicant’s representatives submitted that the expense of removing
” from the advertising, and promotional material in
respect of South Australia alone would be “
prohibitive
Furthermore, uniformity of advertising, promotions and operation of the chain
are fundamental to the viability of this expanding
chain of franchised
restaurants.
I accept the applicant’s evidence that the restaurant chain specializes
in steaks, seafood and generally with an Australian
outback theme with a family
orientated style of operation.
I also accept that there is little likelihood that “
as proposed in this instance would create confusion in the minds of the public
having regard to the intended physical appearance
of the proposed restaurant and
” appearing last in the proposed premises name.
The likelihood of any confusion will also be diminished by a requirement that
Family Restaurant
” signage or similar be prominently
displayed at or near the entrance to the premises.
At the request of the applicant, I sought the views of the Australian Hotels
Association in relation to the proposed use of the word
as sought in this instance. The Association provided a written response that it
had no issue with the proposal.
I note that a written submission was received from legal representatives of a
local licensee submitting that the proposed use of bar
does not comply
Liquor Licensing Act
and will be misleading to the public as it
contains the word “Bar” .....’
Having considered the evidence and submissions in respect of this
application, I find that the use of the “
”, as sought,
will not be an obstacle to the grant of a restaurant licence, however, subject
to the following conditions, which
I intend to impose on the grant of a
restaurant licence:
1. Consumption of liquor at or adjacent to any bar or servery shall not be
2. There shall be no stools placed at the liquor servery.
licensee shall comply with any direction or requirement of the Liquor and
Gambling Commissioner in relation to signage or promotion
of the restaurant.
This matter has been determined on its merits having regard to the
particular facts and should not be taken generally as a precedent.
” in a different context may well be found to be
inappropriate.
I note that the application is adjourned for Callover on 22 May 2009 at 9 am
pending receipt of all required Council approvals, further
noting that the
applicant has liberty to apply in the event that such approvals are obtained
prior to that date.
