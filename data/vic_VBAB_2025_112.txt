CONSIDERATION
Legislative framework
97(1) of the Act provides:
The owner must pay to the adjoining owner
all costs and expenses necessarily incurred by the adjoining owner in assessing
protection work and in supervising the carrying out of protection work
in respect of the adjoining property and—
(a) agreed between the adjoining owner and the owner; or
(b) in the absence of an agreement, determined by the Building Appeals Board
under Part 10.
155 (which is in Part 10) of the Act provides:
If an owner and
adjoining owner cannot agree in relation to a matter arising under Part 7, and
the Building Appeals Board does not
have jurisdiction to deal with that matter
under any other provision of this Part, either of them may refer the matter to
the Building
Appeals Board.
Recoverable costs
note a difference between the provisions of s 97 of the Act and the
Applicant’s submission.
Act refers to the ‘costs and expenses necessarily incurred ... in
assessing proposed protection work’, and the Applicant

(addressed to Tim Landy of TDL Legal):
(a) commences:
We have reviewed the structural engineering drawings of Farrar D consulting
engineers and the geotechnical report prepared by Intrax.
(b) and concludes:
In our view the structural design available to us is insufficiently
developed, and there is insufficient information to reasonably
engineering aspects of the proposed excavation and attendant shoring design.
are satisfied that the engineering expenses charged by Drew Rudd Engineers
($1,716.00 plus GST) were wholly related to assessing
the proposed protection
work and were necessarily incurred.
Accordingly,
we are satisfied that the Applicant ought to be reimbursed the full amount
charged by Drew Rudd, that is,
‘memo’ from Shane Leonard of Phillip Chun to Mr Landy
I have reviewed the documentation provided and I make the
following observations and recommendations in regard to the Protection Works
the memo, Mr Leonard makes observations about deficiencies in the proposed
protection work, however, at least one of those
observations does not (in Mr
Leonard’s own words) relate to the Applicant’s land.
Furthermore,
some of the matters identified by Mr Leonard duplicate findings of the engineer
and some of them do not involve an assessment
of the proposed protection work,
The agreement of protection work does not authorise
trespass for the purposes of carrying out building work. Whilst practically the

of the above matters, we do not think that

consider there to be a need for us to exercise judgement as to what is
reasonable in these circumstances.
Accordingly,
we will order the Respondent to pay two thirds of the amount claimed in respect
of the Phillip Chun invoice, that is,
noted above, the first communication to the Respondent from the
Applicant’s solicitor focussed on procedural matters (lack
of a Form 7 and
the narration accompanying the first line item on the second invoice from TDL

those circumstances, we do not accept that the legal fees in the first invoice
from TDL Legal reflects costs necessarily incurred
in assessing proposed
protection work.
Accordingly,
we will not make any orders regarding the first invoice from TDL Legal.
we have not seen any communication to or from TDL Legal, it appears to us that
their main role was to obtain the input of both

– two consultants who have the technical expertise to assess proposed
protection work.
TDL Legal have charged $920.00 for:

work appears to be either an assessment of the protection work notice (as
opposed to an assessment of the proposed protection
work) or duplication of the
work carried out by the engineer and the building surveyor.
Accordingly,
we do not think that this amount should be included in the amount to be
reimbursed.
remainder of the fees appear to us to be fees that were necessarily incurred in
assessing the proposed protection work.
Accordingly,
we will order the Respondent to reimburse the Applicant $1,588.00 in respect of
the legal fees incurred,
consider that amount of $5,064.00 to be costs that were necessarily incurred in
assessing proposed protection work and will make
orders requiring the Respondent
to reimburse that amount to the Applicant.
