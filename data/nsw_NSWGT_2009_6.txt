REASONS FOR DECISION
Date of order
September 2009
What the Tribunal decided
1. The Tribunal dismissed the application
for a guardianship order.
Tribunal directed Mrs EAI, as attorney, to lodge accounts and other records with
the Tribunal and adjourned the application for
review of Power of Attorney for
further hearing.
TKX is an 88 year old woman with dementia who lives at a Nursing Home in Sydney.
Prior to March 2009 she had been living with
her daughter Mrs EAI and Mrs
EAI’s family. Mrs EAI held an Appointment of Enduring Guardian and
Enduring Power of Attorney,
signed by Mrs TKX in October 2005.
TKX has six other children who are step-siblings to Mrs EAI. They are the
applicants in this matter and Mrs GAE. The applicants
felt excluded from their
mother’s life by Mrs EAI. The five children had applied for review of the
Enduring Power of Attorney.
Mrs QAQ also made a guardianship application.
Guardianship
was clear that Mrs TKX’s dementia makes her unable to make important life
decisions, so that the Tribunal could have made
a guardianship order if one was
appropriate in her interests.
Mrs TKX is now living at a Nursing Home and there was no dispute about the
appropriateness of her accommodation and care
five children felt that their access to their mother was impeded whilst she was
living with Mrs EAI, and that they had not been
kept informed in relation to
their mother’s situation.
now that Mrs TKX is in the nursing home, her children did not envisage
difficulties with visiting her. They were keen for
one of them to be informed
in relation to changes in their mother’s situation. Sister Z from the
nursing home said that,
as well as Mrs EAI, the nursing home would be willing to
have another family member whom they kept informed about significant changes.
It was agreed that Mrs QAQ would be this person.
the absence of a guardianship order, Mrs EAI would be “person
responsible” for her mother under the Appointment of
Enduring Guardian (or
even if this was not valid, due to her being the carer of her mother prior to
the nursing home). This mean
she is the person to provide consents to medical
treatment. Other family members did not have a problem with this.
all of these circumstances, Mrs QAQ was open to the Tribunal dismissing the
guardianship application. In light of the common ground
reached in the hearing,
the Tribunal felt that a guardianship order would have been an unnecessary
circumstances change and a guardianship order is required in Mrs TKX’s
interests, a further application can be made to the
Review of Power of Attorney
12. In October 2005, Mrs TKX
signed an Enduring Power of Attorney appointing
her daughter, Mrs EAI. The rest of Mrs TKX’s children, except for Mrs
GAE, now asked the Tribunal to review the Power of Attorney.
In the application
they said that Mrs TKX would not have fully understood the Power of Attorney.
They said that Mrs TKX had expressed
concerns about Mrs EAI “being her
boss”. They said they would like to see an outside party oversee Mrs
TKX’s affairs.
first question for the Tribunal was whether or not it should conduct a review of
the Power of Attorney.
the time of Mrs TKX signing the Power of Attorney, she was living for some
months with her daughter Mrs NAN. Mrs NAN told the
Tribunal that at that time
her mother was complaining about not recalling things, and was good on some days
and not on others. Mrs
NAN did not pick up that she may have dementia.
Tribunal had a report from Mrs TKX’s longstanding General Practitioner, Dr
Y. Dr Y had not seen Mrs TKX from July 2004
until June 2006. It was in July
2006 that Mrs EAI first brought to Dr Y’s attention that Mrs TKX was
becoming quite forgetful.
She scored 15 out of 30 on a Mini Mental State
Examination and was diagnosed with vascular dementia. She was generally lucid
the day but had difficulties at night. Dr Y believed that she was still
capable of managing her life decisions and financial affairs
during daytime.
Subsequently,
Mrs TKX’s cognition deteriorated further and Dr Y felt that, in the first
half of 2007, she lost her ability to
manage life decisions and financial
affairs. While she was still able to make decisions, it was apparent to Dr Y
that she wished
to have Mrs EAI look after her affairs. Dr Y had only ever
witnessed caring interactions between Mrs TKX and members of the I family.
were other very positive reports concerning the relationship between Mrs EAI and
application stated that Mrs TKX owned a property at Sydney, had an ANZ Bank
account and a pension.
the hearing, Mrs EAI told the Tribunal that Mrs TKX now had a pension and about
$26,000 to $27,000 in the bank. The 25 acre Sydney
property had been sold in
December 2007 for $250,000. This was a private sale to someone introduced by a
neighbour. Mrs EAI had
worked out an appropriate price by checking valuations
on the internet and contacting a few real estate agents.
Tribunal asked where the $250,000 had gone. Mrs EAI said it had gone

the Sydney sale Mrs TKX had been on a part pension for a time, but was back on a
full pension by late 2008.
EAI said that Mrs TKX was not showing any memory loss at the time when the Power
of Attorney was made.
QAQ expressed great concern that $200,000 had gone from the Sydney sale. She
said that the money should still be there for her
mother’s benefit. Mr
XAC said that he had been paying the rates on the Sydney property.
EAI emphasised that her mother’s needs were all being met. It also
appeared that Mrs EAI had provided a very high level
of support to Mrs TKX over
many years.
view of the depletion in the Sydney sale proceeds, and the question raised in
relation to Mrs TKX’s capacity at the time
the Power of Attorney was
signed, the Tribunal decided that it should conduct a review of the Power of
Tribunal was inclined to think that it should direct Mrs EAI to provide an
accounting for Mrs TKX’s finances with a view
to a further hearing when
this accounting had been provided. Mrs EAI and Mrs QAQ were agreeable to this
Tribunal has made directions in relation to Mrs EAI providing an accounting by
30 November 2009. In order to provide the accounting,
the Tribunal would expect
Mrs EAI to seek out documentary evidence to substantiate expenses, for example,
obtaining receipts from
service providers and suppliers of materials and work.
To any extent that Mrs EAI is unable to provide substantiating material,
should provide a written explanation with the accounting. This includes

as stated in the report of Loretta Rosicky, Case Officer with the Tribunal, the
applicants feel that an independent financial
manager should take over
management of Mrs TKX’s affairs, they should lodge an application for a
financial management order
by 21 December. The Tribunal would consider this
application on its merits at the adjourned hearing. (Now that the Tribunal has
made orders on the Application to Review Power of Attorney, it is not open to it
to treat that application as an application for
a financial management order.)
