APPEARANCES
Mr. E. Zagami, town planning consultant, appeared for the applicant.
Mr. P. Connor of Counsel, appeared for the responsible authority.
1. This is an application to review the decision of the responsible authority
to refuse permission for the construction of a building
at the rear of the
existing shop building on the land for use as a garage/storage area.
2. The land is part of a subdivision of small lots on the west side of McNamara
Street, Macleod. What appears to have been intended
to be a local shopping
centre no longer functions as such. There is a milk bar and a large two-storey
office building but the other
buildings are either vacant or are used for a mix
of non-retail purposes. There is a bakery towards the northern end of the
and a number of motor vehicle oriented activities as well as a cabinet
maker at the southern end at the corner of Jacka Street.
Rear access to the
commercial premises is available via a lane off Jacka Street. The lane appears
to have been widened at some time
to about 5m to facilitate access.
3. The land has a frontage of 6.19m and depths of 55.19m and 54.3m on its
southern and northern boundaries respectively. The land
rises towards the west
(rear) with the difference in levels between the east and west ends of the site
being 3.35m.
4. The building on the land has been used until quite recently as a light
industry - making wooden toys - and dwelling. No permits
have been issued for
these uses as required in the Restricted Business Zone. The existing building
has a floor area of 163m
and the proposed building has a floor area
. It is to be built to both side boundaries and would have a
height of 6.32m at the eastern end but reduces to 4.05m at the rear.
roller shutter door is to be provided at the rear so that car parking and
loading/unloading can occur within the building.
The timber used in the
activity is to be stored in racks.
5. The provisions of the Restricted Business Zone and the proposed Business 1
Zone of the new planning scheme were set out in some
detail in the submissions
of Messrs Connor and Zagami. A shop is an as-of-right use while light industry
and dwelling are uses for
which a permit may be granted in the current planning
6. Mr Zagami referred the Tribunal to the Council's Municipal Strategic
Statement which forms part of the new planning scheme at
page 19 where the
future of local commercial centres such as this is discussed. The strategy for
these centres is to :
"Encourage the transition of small unviable shopping centres to non-retail
uses - including office, service business and residential
appropriate".
7. When the proposal was advertised, no objections were received. The
responsible authority decided to refuse to grant a permit
for the reasons set
out earlier.
REASONS FOR ORDER
8. After hearing and considering the submissions, the Tribunal had a general
discussion with the parties. It appears the applicant
now has indicated that
he wishes to display and sell toys from the front section of the building and
continue to manufacture them
in the existing building. The dwelling at the
rear is not used on a regular basis but still is required. The toys currently
sold at shopping centres in Ivanhoe and Canterbury. The new building will
provide extra space for the storage of timber together
with loading/unloading
under cover and car parking. Some sawing of timber to required lengths will be
required to be carried out
in the new building. The difference between the
floor levels of the buildings is related to the slope of the land.
9. The responsible authority has threatened the applicant with enforcement
proceedings and the uses have ceased pending the making
of an application for
permission which Mr Zagami said would now be made.
10. The Tribunal was provided with an excellent series of photographs of the
site and surrounds and other useful written material.
11. Having considered the material, the Tribunal said that, in principle, there
was good reason to support the planning permit application.
accepted that this shopping centre has undergone changes and its use for other
than retailing is its new function. The
proposal in this case to introduce a
shop front and retailing, albeit of somewhat specialised items, ought to be a
welcome addition
to the centre.
12. The problem with this application is that the building and use are
ancillary to the uses which have ceased because they have
not been authorised
by a planning permit. The Tribunal does not consider it should grant the
permit sought in the absence of an
authorised use. In any event, the Tribunal
would not wish to hinder the proper consideration of an application for the
activities on the site.
13. Mr Zagami indicated that it would be desirable for a new application to be
made incorporating the entire proposal for the site.
The Tribunal supports
that as being the proper way for the uses and development to be handled.
14. The Tribunal suggested that the application for review should be adjourned
sine die pending the making and consideration of the
new application for a
planning permit. If required, this application for review can be listed for
hearing at short notice. Any
application for review arising from the new
planning permit application can be listed for hearing at the same time. This
was acceptable
to the parties.
The order of the Tribunal is that the application for review is adjourned sine
