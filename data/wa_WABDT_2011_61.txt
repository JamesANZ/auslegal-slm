Damages for breach of building contract,
Introduction
21 May 2010 Yong Cheng (“
the Complainant
”) lodged a complaint
form at the Tribunal in relation to a building contract entered into between
himself and Gemmill Homes
the Respondent
construction of residential premises at 3 Kapara Place, Quinns Rocks. The
contract price was $192,114.00. The contract
was signed on 8 April
Complainant’s claim is in relation to what he alleged was a breach of
contract by the Builder. He sought damages arising
from that breach. Full
particulars of his claim were annexed to the complaint form and appear at Folios
5 and 6 of the Book of Documents
used at the hearing.
circumstances giving rise to the Complainant’s complaint was that he
entered into a building contract with the Respondent
and that the Respondent
breached that contract prior to the building commencing. The Complainant’s
complaint was based on a
letter dated the 12
May 2010, signed by
the Respondent’s Administration Manager Travis Glossop in which he
“It has been determined that we will not be offering you a contract
to build your home”
which was a clear indication that the Respondent did not intend to proceed
with building the house and accordingly a breach of the
building contract
entered into between the parties, referred to above. He ought be entitled to
damages and he claimed a sum of $59,736.21
a nutshell, the Respondent’s response was that at no time was there a
contract between it and the Complainant and therefore
there could be no issue of
any contract being breached. Therefore, any claim for damages arising from a
breach were ill founded.
Essentially,
the dispute before the Tribunal was in two parts. First, it was necessary for
the Tribunal to establish whether or not
a contract had been entered into
between the parties. Secondly, if that was in fact the case, the issue for the
Tribunal to then
determine was the amount of damages appropriate to be awarded to the
Complainant arising from the Respondent’s breach of contract.
Tribunal has taken into account the final written submissions of the
Complainant in coming to its finding.
Was there a breach of contract?
issue of the existence of the building contract, which was strenuously denied by
the Respondent Builder, was the subject of a
hearing at the Tribunal on 3
November 2010.
that hearing, evidence was taken from both the Complainant and Mr Mark Stewart,
who was the sales manager at Gemmill Homes Pty
Ltd and who dealt with the
Complainant in the negotiations leading up to the alleged building contract
being entered into. He was
called by the Respondent to give evidence as to the
negotiations and documentation leading up to what the Complainant says is the
contract entered into. Mr Stewart’s evidence was that there the
negotiations between him and the Complainant had resulted in
a contract being
entered into between the parties.
hearing thus was adjourned after Mr Stewart had finished his evidence. A further
hearing on the quantum in relation to the damages
arising from the breach of
contract was listed with the issue of whether there had been a contract in
existence to be decided by
the Tribunal.
next hearing was held on 28 April 2011. At the commencement of this hearing the
Respondent’s legal representative advised
the Tribunal that the issue of
whether or not a contract existed with the Complainant was no longer an
Respondent conceded that there
a contract, and therefore the only
issue for the Tribunal to determine was that of damages arising from the breach.
The hearing was
thus focussed on the evidence from the Complainant to support
the heads of damages that he was seeking. Each of these will be dealt
separately.
Complainant was very emotional in giving his evidence. The Tribunal sought, at
all times, to ensure that his inability to articulate
his position was not going
to, and did not, prejudice his case. He was dealt with with patience and
Complainant’s claims for damages were under the following
Complainant’s claim for interest is as particularised at Folio 139 of the
Book of Documents. The amount totalled $4,104.78.
The table at Folio 139
identifies the basis of the calculation, the amount borrowed upon which the
interest became due and owing
being $231,000.00. The Complaint spoke to these
documents. The interest was calculated from 2 February 2010, which was the date
which the Complainant alleged that he began negotiations with the sales
representative to build the house. The calculation for the
interest sought
ceased on 12 May 2010 being the date upon which the Complainant alleges that the
Respondent advised that they would
no longer build the home (therefore the date
of the conceded breach of contract). The Complainant’s claim is thus based
“wasted interest”.
amount is referred to again at Folio 100 of the Book of
Respondent’s submission was that the Complainant suffered no loss. As
clearly indicated in the evidence, the Complainant,
upon the breach of contract
occurring, sought an alternative builder to build a house for him. This was
successfully achieved and
in fact a house built on the property for the
Complainant by the “Second Builder” was completed before the hearing
(being the end of April 2011).
building contract entered into between the Complainant and the Respondent
provided for completion date 240 working days after
analysis of time frames within the building contract between the Complainant and
the Respondent would have had completion of the
residence occurring towards the
end of June 2011.
the breach of contract has resulted in the residence in fact being completed
than the time allowed for in the Gemmill
to a determination by the Tribunal in relation to interest charges is the
fundamental proposition that the Complainant is
entitled to be put back into
position that he would have been in had the contract not been breached. The
evidence before the Tribunal is that the Complainant was
in the same, if not a
better position than he would have been, if the breach had not occurred. This
claim is dismissed.
The loss of value
Complainant’s claim in relation to the loss of value is that, because of
the breach, the Complainant had to engage an alternative
builder and build a
different residence. The Complainant alleges that the breach of contract
resulted in him being unable to enjoy
the architecture aesthetics of the Gemmill
said that the 296 square metre house the subject of his contract with the
Respondent could not be duplicated by any other builder,
and no other builder
had a equivalent sized design. As a result, the Complainant had to compromise in
his choice of replacement house
and built a different style and size house. This
resulted in a loss of value.
Complainant provided no evidence at the hearing as to the cost of the
replacement house,
that which that was the subject of the
building contract. A diminution of value claim would require the Complainant to
give evidence
as to the to the value of the “replacement house” and
show that that value was less than that which was to be enjoyed
had the original
house been completed.
Complainant, relying on:
his background
as a civil engineer familiar with the cost estimate
as a builder of
six houses prior to the Gemmill contract with the associated connections with
valuers, and cost estimators,
his experience
as a sales representative with a real estate and business agent
gave evidence that the diminution of value was
$30,000.00.
Tribunal was not persuaded by the Complainant’s evidence in relation to
the calculations of the loss of value. Given that
no independent evidence was
brought to establish the diminution of value, and that no costings were made
available on the replacement
house as built comparative to that which would have
been built by Gemmill Homes and its associated costs, the Tribunal finds that
damages should be awarded.
Loss of rental income
Complainant sought loss of rental income for $7,071.43. This he alleged would be
the rental based on $500 per week which was supported
by comparable market data
from the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia website which he produced at
the hearing.
contractual date for completion (albeit if the full contract time was taken to
build the residence) would not have been until
June 2011. As stated above, the
house the Complainant built following the termination of the contract by Gemmill
was completed towards
the end of April 2011.
is no evidence before the Tribunal to support a claim that the complainant has
lost rental income. This claim is simply not
supportable in logic, fact, or
Loss of income
Complainant alleges a loss of $1,275.00 being time spent dealing with the
Respondent in relation to the contract prior to it being
terminated. He based
this loss at a rate of $150.00 per hour which was that which he alleged,
supported by a by self- serving document
written by himself, was the income that
he was earning per hour at the time that he was engaging in these
negotiations.
Tribunal is not satisfied that the hourly rate alleged to be his income has been
established. Nor is there evidence that the Complainant
did in fact suffer a
loss of income for the number of hours or at the hourly rate
balance, the Tribunal is not satisfied that this amount ought be
the complainant’s claims are all dismissed.
The Complainant’s complaint is
