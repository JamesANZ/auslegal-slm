Reasons for Decision
Background to review
Applicant made a request to the Agency for access to certain documents.
Following consultation with the Agency, the Applicant
clarified the initial
request and sought access to:
report prepared by a third party]
report prepared by another third party]
interviews]
Workcover report and related documents]
[Complaints
and documents relating to the complaints]
Resources/personnel documents relating to the Applicant].
Applicant, in their clarified request, also confirmed they:
(a) seek access to draft documents, but they seek only the last draft if there
is no final version of the document;
(b) do not seek access to duplicate documents;
(c) seek access to commercial information relating to third parties; and
(d) seek access to the personal affairs information of third parties in relation
to Items 1, 2, 4 and 4a of the request, but do not
seek access to personal
affairs information of third parties in relation to the balance of the request
the course of the review, the Agency advised that the incorrect number of pages,
‘789’, was noted in its decision
letter to the Applicant. The
correct number of pages is 769.
Agency identified 769 pages falling within the terms of the Applicant’s
request and refused access to some pages in full
and some pages in part,
exempting certain information under sections 30(1), 33(1), 35(1)(a), 35(1)(b)
and 36(2)(b). The Agency also
determined that certain information is outside the
terms of the Applicant’s request and deleted this information as
information under section 25.
Agency’s decision letter sets out the reasons for its
Review application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under section 49A(1) of
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
have examined a copy of the documents subject to review.
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section
49H(2) in relation to the review.
the review, OVIC submitted that the information on the following pages, which
the Agency previously determined is irrelevant
information, is within the scope
of Item 7 of the Applicant’s clarified request:
(a) pages 168 to 171;
(b) page 214;
(c) page 224;
(d) page 237; and
(e) pages 642 to 668.
Agency agreed with OVIC staff’s view that those pages fall within the
scope of point 7 of the request and provided OVIC
with marked up documents for
the above listed pages, reflecting the information the Agency considers exempt
from release under section
Agency also submitted that redactions were omitted incorrectly in relation to
certain information on pages 566 to 589. The Agency
provided OVIC with marked up
pages reflecting the information the Agency considers exempt from release under
section 33(1).
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
conducting a review under section 49F, section 49P requires that I make a new or
‘fresh decision’. Therefore, my review
does not involve determining
whether the Agency’s decision is correct, but rather requires my fresh
decision to be the ‘correct
or preferable
This involves
ensuring my decision is correctly made under the FOI Act and any other
applicable law in force at the time of my decision.
Section 30(1) – Internal working documents
be exempt under section 30(1), three conditions must be satisfied:
(a) the document or information is matter in the nature of:
(a) opinion, advice or recommendation prepared by an agency officer or a
Minister; or
(b) consultation or deliberation that has taken place between agency officers or
Ministers; and
(b) the matter was created during the deliberative process of an agency,
Minister, or the government’s functions; and
(c) disclosure of the matter would be contrary to the public interest.
exemption does not apply to purely factual material in a
Deliberative information
term ‘officer of an Agency’ is defined in section 5(1). It includes
a member of the agency, a member of the agency’s
staff, and any person
employed by or for the agency, regardless of whether they are subject to the
Public Administration Act 2004
(Vic) or not.
am satisfied the consultants who prepared the reports relevant to Items 1 and 2
of the Applicant’s clarified request are an
‘officer’ of the
Agency for the purposes of
section 30(1).
I am satisfied most of the information determined exempt under
section 30(1)
throughout the documents contain the opinion, advice or recommendations of
Agency officers.
I also consider the Agency has exempted a small amount of factual information in
the documents that is not exempt under
section 30(1)
due to the operation of
section 30(3).
Deliberative process
I am satisfied the information is not purely factual, I am also satisfied the
information was created during the deliberative
processes of the Agency, being
in relation to the management of staff and workplace
Would disclosure of the documents be contrary to the
public interest?
deciding whether the information exempted by the Agency would be contrary to the
public interest, I have given weight to the following
(a) the right of every person to gain access to documents under the FOI Act;
(b) the sensitivity of the issues involved and the broader context of how the
documents were created;
(c) the stage of a decision or policy development at the time the communications
(d) whether disclosure of the documents would be likely to inhibit
communications between agency officers that are essential for
the agency to make
an informed and well-considered decision or for those officers to properly
participate in a process of the agency’s
functions (such as an audit or
investigation, regulatory or law enforcement function);
(e) whether disclosure of the documents would give merely a part explanation,
rather than a complete explanation, for the taking
of a particular decision or
the outcome of a process, but only where the agency would not otherwise be able
to explain upon disclosure
of the documents;
(f) the impact of disclosing documents in draft form, including disclosure not
clearly or accurately representing a final decision
by an agency or Minister;
(g) the likelihood that disclosure would inhibit the independence of officers,
including their ability to conduct proper research
and make detailed
submissions;
(h) the public interest in the community being better informed about an
agency’s deliberative, consultative and decision-making
(i) the public interest in government transparency and accountability by
enabling scrutiny or criticism of decisions and the decision-making
process and
building the community’s trust in government and its decision making
processes; and
(j) whether there is controversy or impropriety around the decision or the
decision-making process.
note the Agency’s decision letter setting out the reasons it considers
disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.
note the following in relation to the exempted information:
(a) the information is sensitive, as it relates to difficult circumstances and
interpersonal relationships in the workplace;
(b) some of the information appears in emails, which usually, by their nature,
include an Agency officer’s early considerations
of a matter;
(c) while Agency officers are required to provide professional advice, I
consider the disclosure of such sensitive information may
inhibit future
communications;
(d) managers and human resources officers are required to handle sensitive
information and must be able to provide their frank advice
in a timely manner;
(e) such information is deliberated on by Agency officers in the interests of
workplace safety for all employees.
weighing the above factors, I have carefully considered where the public
interest lies in this matter. I have determined the public
interest weighs
against disclosure. In my view, disclosure of most of the information would have
a detrimental impact on the Agency’s
ability to manage its staff and
provide for workplace safety. Certain information is therefore exempt under
section 30(1).
I have determined disclosure of certain information would not be contrary to the
public interest in the following circumstances:
(a) where it is less sensitive or general in nature;
(b) where it relates to the Applicant only, that is, it is severable from the
personal affairs of others;
(c) where it relates to the advice and opinion of the consultants employed by
the Agency, that is, it does not reflect the opinions
of other Agency officers,
and I do not consider they could be identified from that information; and
(d) given the above, I do not consider disclosure will have any impact on the
Agency, including in receiving and investigating workplace
such, certain information is therefore not exempt under section
Section 33(1) – Documents affecting personal
document or information is exempt under section 33(1) if two conditions are
(a) the document or information relates to the ‘personal affairs’ of
a natural person (living or deceased); and
(b) disclosure of that personal affairs information is unreasonable in all the
circumstances.
determining whether disclosure of the personal affairs information would be
unreasonable in the circumstances, I have considered
the following
(a) the nature of the personal affairs information;
(b) the circumstances in which the information was obtained;
(c) the extent to which the information is available to the public;
(d) the Applicant’s interest in the information;
(e) whether any public or important interest would be promoted by release of the
information;
(f) whether the individuals to whom the information relates object, or would be
likely to object, to the release of the information;
(g) whether disclosure of the information would or would be reasonably likely to
endanger the life or physical safety of any
Applicant seeks personal affairs information in relation to documents falling
within Items 1, 2, 4 and 4a of the request. I have
located the following in the
documents in relation to these items:
(a) for item 1, the ‘[third party] report, is Document 10;
(b) for item 2, the ‘[third party] report, is Document 25;
(c) for item 4, the ‘Workcover report’, I could not locate any
documents; and
(d) for item 4a, Workcover documents related to two named parties for a
particular timeframe, are Documents 30, 32 and 33.
above documents contain the personal affairs information of individuals other
than the Applicant, this includes their names, information
their opinions on the workplace and other staff members, as well as other
information that could identify them.
note the personal circumstances of the Applicant and their relationship to the
above documents.
note the Agency consulted with several individuals named in the documents, a
majority of whom objected to the release of their information.
into consideration the above factors, I have decided it would be unreasonable to
release most of the personal affairs information
in the documents for the
following reasons:
(a) the information is personal and sensitive, as it relates to the third
parties’ relationships with their colleagues in the
context of workplace
culture and complaints made about the conduct of staff members;
(b) I consider the individuals concerned would object to disclosure, as they
provided the information to the Agency with the expectation
that it would remain
confidential;
(c) disclosure would therefore have a negative impact on the Agency as staff
could conclude that the Agency is not able to protect
the privacy of its
(d) in relation to the reports of workplace investigations, if such information
were to be disclosed, I consider staff would be less
likely to provide similar
sensitive information about their views of their workplace and their colleagues
in the future;
(e) the effect of this would be that the Agency would likely receive less frank
advice in relation to similar matters and in turn
disclosure would have a
negative impact on its ability to provide a safe workplace;
(f) in relation to Workcover documents relating to individuals other than the
Applicant, I consider there is a strong community expectation
documents are disclosed only where necessary and remain between the individual
concerned and their employer;
(g) having considered the above likely effect of disclosure, I consider the
public interest weighs against disclosure of the personal
affairs sought by the
Applicant; and
(h) while there is nothing before me to suggest that the Applicant would further
disseminate the information in the documents, I
must consider that I cannot
place any restrictions on further disclosure once it is released under the FOI
Act and the impact that
further disclosure may have on the privacy of third
acknowledge that some of the personal affairs information is intertwined with
that of the Applicant. Where I cannot exempt information
without rendering the
sentence or passage meaningless, I have decided to exempt the whole passage on
the basis it would be unreasonable
to disclose the personal affairs of the other
parties involved.
also acknowledge that some of the documents contain personal affairs that would
be known to the Applicant. However, primarily for
the reasons set out in
paragraph 34 (h) above, I have decided it would be unreasonable to release
Accordingly,
most of the personal affairs information in the identified documents is
therefore exempt under section 33(1).
in certain circumstances, where the information does not relate to a single
individual, or where it is less sensitive, and
where it mostly relates to the
Applicant, I have determined that it would not be unreasonable to release it and
it is not exempt
under section 33(1).
Section 35(1)(a) –
Information communicated in confidence to an agency that would be exempt if
generated by an agency
document is exempt under section 35(1)(a) if two conditions are satisfied:
(a) disclosure would divulge information or matter communicated in confidence by
or on behalf of a person or a government to an agency
or a Minister; and
(b) the information would be exempt matter if it were generated by an agency or
Agency considered certain information in the documents was exempt under section
35(1)(a). As I consider the information was prepared
by Agency officers it is
more appropriate to consider the application of section 30(1) to that
information.
some of the information claimed exempt under section 35(1)(a), I have determined
different exemptions apply and it remains exempt.
the remainder, I have determined that, while the information may have been
provided in confidence, it is not exempt under section
30(1) for the reasons set
out above in paragraph 27.
Section 35(1)(b) –
Information obtained in confidence
document is exempt under section 35(1)(b) if two conditions are
(a) disclosure would divulge information or matter communicated in confidence by
or on behalf of a person or a government to an agency
or a Minister; and
(b) disclosure would be contrary to the public interest as it would be
reasonably likely to impair the ability of an agency or a
Minister to obtain
similar information in the future.
Was the information obtained in confidence?
information communicated by an individual to an agency was communicated in
confidence is a question of
very limited circumstances, section 35 may apply to particularly sensitive and
confidential information communicated to an agency
For example, in the
context of internal complaints and investigations, or where misconduct or
corruption is reported. In these situations,
the officer’s position is
analogous to that of an outside
note the Agency consulted with a number of individuals named in the documents, a
majority of which objected to the release of their
information on the basis it
was provided confidentially.
am satisfied the information exempted by the Agency was provided by its own
officers, and because it appears in the context of internal
complaints or
investigation, and the individuals themselves advise the information was
provided in confidence, I am satisfied the
information was provided to the
Agency in confidence.
Would disclosure of the information be
contrary to the public interest?
term ‘impair’ is not defined in the FOI Act. However, case law
(a) the degree of impairment must go beyond a trifling or minimal
impairment;
(b) there must be an actual impairment to the ability of the agency to obtain
similar information in the
(c) it is not enough that individuals would be less candid than they otherwise
or would feel
resentment at having their confidence
(d) the necessary level of impairment will be made out if a significant minority
of persons in the relevant group would be firmly
resistant to providing similar
information in the future;
(e) it is the agency that must be impaired from receiving information, not
simply a reluctance on the part of a supplier to provide
information;
(f) the existence of a statutory duty to provide information does not
necessarily exclude the possibility that disclosure would be
reasonably likely
to impair an agency’s ability to obtain similar information in the future,
particularly where disclosure
might impact the quality and quantity of any
future information provided.
comparison, an agency will not be impaired from obtaining a specific type of
information in future, if there is legislation which
compels a person to provide
this type of information to the
am satisfied disclosure of the information would impair the Agency from
obtaining similar information in the future because:
(a) I am satisfied there would be an actual and significant impairment to the
Agency receiving important information about the workplace,
should it be
disclosed in this instance;
(b) I consider this would have a significant impact on the individuals concerned
and on the ability of the Agency to carry out similar
investigations of
complaints in the future; and
(c) the Agency relies on the provision of similar information to provide a safe
am therefore satisfied certain information is exempt under section
I am not satisfied all information to which the Agency claimed section 35(1)(b)
is exempt. For example, where the information
is general in nature, does not
disclose the source of the information, or is the generalised opinion or
recommendation of the consultants
employed by the Agency.
Section 36(2) – Disclosure contrary to public
section 36(2)(b), a document is an exempt document if—
in the case of a document of a council, its disclosure under this Act would
be contrary to the public interest by reason that it would
disclose instructions
issued to, or provided for the use of guidance of, officers of a council on the
procedures to be followed or
the criteria to be applied in negotiation,
including financial, commercial and labour negotiation, in the execution of
in the defence, prosecution and settlement of cases, and in similar
activities relating to the financial property or personnel management
assessment interests of the council.
Agency claimed certain information exempt under section 36(2)(b). For some of
that information, I have decided a different exemption
I have determined another exemption does not apply, I have also decided section
36(2)(b) does not apply. That is, I am not satisfied
that the documents contain
procedures regarding personnel management, rather, they contain more specific
information about the complaints
and investigations specific to the
Section 25 – Deletion of exempt or
irrelevant information
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
Determining
what is ‘practicable’ requires consideration of the effort and
editing involved in making the deletions ‘from
a resources point of
effectiveness of the deletions. Where deletions would render a document
meaningless, they are not ‘practicable’
and release of the document
is not required under section
have considered the information the Agency deleted from the documents as
irrelevant. In some cases, I agree it falls outside the
scope of the
Applicant’s request. However, I find certain information deleted in the
documents by the Agency as irrelevant
falls within the scope of the request.
These documents have therefore been assessed under the FOI Act and are listed in
have considered the effect of deleting irrelevant and exempt information from
the documents. In my view, it is practicable for the
Agency to delete irrelevant
and exempt information from certain documents because it would not require
substantial time and effort,
and the edited documents would retain meaning.
However, I have decided certain documents cannot be
the information before me, I am satisfied certain information in the documents
is exempt from release under sections 30(1), 33(1)
and 35(1)(b). However, I am
not satisfied all the information exempted by the Agency is exempt under those
provisions, or sections
35(1)(a) or 36(2)(b).
it is practicable to provide the Applicant with an edited copy of the documents
with irrelevant and exempt information deleted
in accordance with section 25,
access is granted in part. Where is not, access is refused in full.
