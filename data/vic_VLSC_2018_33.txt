Commissioner Determination (Overcharging) [2018] VLSC
Date of Determination:
29 June 2018
to section 290(2)(e) of the Uniform Law, I make the following order –
Under section
308(3) of the Uniform Law, the Law Practice must
repay $2,257.03
Complainant
within 45 days
I have made this order
in relation to legal costs charged by the Law Practice to the Complainant
regarding the following bills –
Invoice dated 30

Invoice dated 21

(collectively, ‘the Bills’).
I consider the amount of legal costs that are fair and reasonable in relation
to these bills, pursuant to section 292 of the Uniform
(GST inclusive). The Complainant has already paid a sum of
to the Law Practice.
STATEMENT OF REASONS
26 June 2016, the Complainant engaged the Law Practice to assist her with a
Family Law matter. The total legal costs were estimated
as being $60,000.00
December 2016, the Respondent Lawyer assisted the Complainant with a
contravention hearing where she was the defendant. She admitted
the charges,
accepting a financial penalty.
27 February 2017, the Respondent Lawyer and the Complainant attended Court to
attempt to mediate the family custody arrangements.
Respondent Lawyer and the Complainant had a disagreement about the direction for
the matter and the Complainant ceased the retainer
on 28 February 2017.
6 March 2017, my office received the Complainant’s complaint about the
Respondent Lawyer raising issues relating to costs
and the conduct of the
Respondent Lawyer.
Complainant and Respondent Lawyer were unsuccessful in their attempts to resolve
the dispute informally.
Issues under investigation
Complainant raised the following allegations in her complaint, which have been
under investigation –
the costs incurred are fair and reasonable. The Complainant believes that the
Respondent Lawyer did not demonstrate the level
of expertise to justify the
costs incurred;
the Respondent Lawyer failed to act in accordance with the Complainant’s
instructions – in particular, by not
obtaining a psychological report;
the Respondent Lawyer was unprofessional and
Investigation
Fair and reasonable
legal costs
costs review has been undertaken of the Law Practice’s client file and
finalised by my office on a question of the validity
of the Costs Agreement and
Disclosure Statement. As the Costs Agreement was found to be valid, the Law
Practice’s client file
was assessed in accordance with the Costs Agreement
dated 20 June 2016 relevant at the time the Bills were issued. I consider that
(including GST) represents fair and reasonable legal costs,
which amounts to a reduction of
from the Bills.
have reduced the amount the Law Practice is able to charge for the following
notes were not accurately kept. In particular, the Respondent Lawyer’s
notes did not include the length of conversations
or the time. The Costs Court
of the Supreme Court of Victoria would normally allow one unit in those
circumstances for the attendance;
proving some attendances were missing.
follow instructions
an email dated 3 March 2017, the Complainant states that the Respondent Lawyer
failed to correctly submit documents to the Court
relating to the defence of her
contravention matter. In particular, she says a psychologist report was not
provided in affidavit
form. The Complainant says her instructions to have the
psychologist and her general practitioner subpoenaed to provide evidence
also disregarded.
file notes in the Law Practice’s client file shows the Respondent Lawyer
discussed obtaining a report from the Complainant’s
psychologist. The
psychologist’s report was obtained on 1 April 2016. The
psychologist’s report was an appendix to the
affidavit in response to the
Complainant’s contravention application. There was no requirement to have
the psychologist report
submitted as a separate affidavit.
response to the Complainant’s claim that she requested various medical
professionals to be subpoenaed for her family law
matter, the Respondent Lawyer
has said that there was one discussion about medical professionals. This
discussion was limited to
the children’s psychologist. Having reviewed the
Law Practice’s client file, there are notes that show discussions between
the Respondent Lawyer and Complainant about various medical professionals. There
is no evidence within the file notes to show these
discussions include a
subpoena request or to provide evidence for the medical professionals to provide
evidence for the Complainant.
Professional Conduct
her email dated 6 March 2017, the Complainant said that during the mediation,
the Respondent Lawyer advised her to give in on every
detail. When she
disagreed, the Complainant says the Respondent Lawyer threw her glasses on the
table and yelled at her, left the
room and slammed the door on her way out. The
Complainant said that she terminated the retainer the following day.
3 May 2017, the Principal of the Law Practice wrote to the Complainant providing
an explanation as to the Respondent Lawyer’s
conduct. The Principal
explained that the Respondent Lawyer had become irritated with the Complainant
late in the afternoon on 27
February 2017. The Complainant had revised her
instructions, which could have hampered negotiations with the
Complainant’s
ex-partner. The letter, dated 3 May 2017, states that the
Respondent Lawyer not only apologised that afternoon, but also emailed
Complainant the following day.
the Respondent Lawyer has acknowledged the incident on 27 February 2017 was
inappropriate, I do not consider the conduct complained
of amounts to
unsatisfactory professional conduct. The Respondent Lawyer is remorseful and
provided an apology verbally and in writing.
I have reminded the Respondent
Lawyer that this conduct should not be repeated.
of fact on issues under investigation
investigated the matter, I have found –
Respondent Lawyer has failed to comply with section 172 of the Uniform Law. The
costs that the Law Practice has billed to the
Complainant are not fair and
reasonable. A costs review has reduced the Law Practice’s costs and found
fair and reasonable
costs to be –
1 - $853.42;
2 - $4,693.83;
3 - $2,048.20; and
4 - $3,253.14
Respondent Lawyer has not failed to act in accordance with the
Complainant’s instructions relating to submitting psychologist
reports and
subpoenaing other medical professional
Respondent Lawyer has not acted in a manner that constitutes unsatisfactory
professional conduct.
Relevant law
290(2)(e) of the Uniform Law states that in determining a consumer matter, my
office may make a compensation order against
the respondent in accordance with
308(3) of the Uniform Law provides that a compensation order may include an
order that the respondent lawyer or law practice
must repay the whole or a
specified part of the amount charged to the aggrieved person by the lawyer or
law practice in respect of
specified legal
Determination
considered all of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I determine
that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the orders detailed above.
in making a determination as to costs, I have determined that the amount is fair
and reasonable in all the circumstances
having regard to section 200 of the
Uniform Law, and the following matters. I have also considered the principles in
section 172
of the Uniform Law.
I am satisfied that the prerequisites for making a compensation order (pursuant
to section 309 of the Uniform Law) have been
Non-compliance
be aware that a failure to comply with a determination in a consumer matter may
amount to conduct capable of constituting unsatisfactory
professional conduct or
professional misconduct.
