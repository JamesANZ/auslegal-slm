Sawden v Queensland Racing [2009] QRAT 20 (15 July 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
15 July 2009
Andrew George Sawden
RESPONDENT:
Queensland Racing
APPEARANCES:
Mr Andrew Sawden on his own behalf and Mr N Torpey on behalf of the
respondent Queensland Racing
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
Mr Leo Williams AO – Chairman
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
The appellant Andrew George Sawden was an employee of trainer Brian Wakefield
and at the relevant date of this offence he had allowed
registration of his
licence with Queensland Racing to lapse. The issue relative to the licence has
little relevance other than a
suggestion was raised during the course of the
original inquiry that the stewards may well have had no power to impose any
on a person who was not at the relevant time licensed under the Rules of
Racing. The Tribunal makes no finding in respect to that
issue but simply
opines that at the relevant time Mr Sawden did come within the confines of the
Rules of Racing and was at that time
the stable foreman for trainer
It is apparent from the transcript that a complaint was made to Queensland
Racing by Ms Eraina Temple. She was also, at the time
an employee of
trainer Wakefield. The complaint is contained in Exhibit 1 which is an email
submitted to the Administrator at Queensland
Racing and detailed that there had
been verbal and physical abuse towards herself and also cruelty towards her cat.
It was alleged
that the incident happened on Friday 23 January at approximately
3.15 pm at the stables registered to trainer Wakefield and acknowledged
appellant was at the relevant time in charge of those stables and the staff for
the week while trainer Wakefield was absent
in New Zealand.
Upon receipt of the complaint an investigation was undertaken by stewards
acting on behalf of Queensland Racing and various people
were interviewed and
statements obtained from them during the course of an Inquiry. The first
interview was conducted by senior
steward Mr B Turner in company with Ms J Pick
of Integrity Services on Friday 30 January 2009 when stablehand and complainant
E Temple was questioned. Subsequently on 30 January (after conclusion of the
first interview) a second interview by those same persons
was conducted of the
appellant Andrew Sawden. It is not relevant to embark on a protracted
discussion on what was said other than
to identify that at no point in time was
Ms Temple present whilst Mr Sawden was being interviewed. A third interview was
on 4 February by Mr B Turner when a stablehand Chris Chandler was
interviewed by way of a phone conversation.
As a result of this interview process the stewards opened an Inquiry into the
incident in question which Inquiry commenced on 12 February
2009 at which Mr
Sawden and Mr Wakefield were questioned. The Inquiry was reconvened on Thursday
26 March when a charge was laid
against Mr Sawden under Australian Rule of
Racing 175(q) which stipulates
The Committee of any Club or the Stewards may punish:
(q) Any person who in their opinion is guilty of any misconduct, improper
conduct or unseemly behaviour
The stewards identified improper conduct as being the significant element of
the charge in that on the day in question Mr Sawden acted
improperly in that
after entering into a verbal altercation with fellow employee Ms Eraina Temple
you did then make physical contact with Ms Temple by grabbing her on the
upper arms and pushing her away.
That Inquiry became somewhat heated as it
was alleged initially that there was no evidence of any attack, assault or other
other than an admission by Ms Temple that she had thrown a bucket at Mr
Sawden. Eventually there was an acknowledgement that some
verbal attack had
been entered into between the two parties and that, by his own admission, the
appellant had pushed Ms Temple.
There was no evidence that she had been injured
however she did make a complaint to the police which did not proceed.
On 8 April 2009 Mr Wade Birch provided written confirmation of the charge
that had been levelled at the Inquiry hearing on 26 March.
The letter again
identified the basis of the improper conduct charge and offered Mr Sawden the
opportunity to defend the charge
and suggested that submissions in defence could
be in a written form to be forwarded to the stewards by close of business on
24 April. Mr Sawden responded in writing on 23 April and confirmed that
the primary submission related to the fact that he was not
at the relevant time
a person licensed under the Rules. He did make some submissions relevant to the
event in question and confirmed
that there had been no witness to the event and
no evidence produced that favours Ms Temple’s version of events over that
Mr Sawden. On Friday 29 May the Inquiry resumed when the Chairman of
Stewards telephoned Mr Sawden and confirmed that by letter
of 1 May the stewards
had determined:
After taking into account all the relevant evidence, we hereby find you
guilty of the abovementioned charge for the following reasons
The letter dated 1 May identified a number of other issues. One of those was
summarised on page 2 in the following manner:
In regard to the evidence relating to the event, Stewards have found that
your conduct in “pushing” Ms Temple was improper.
You admit in your
evidence on 12 February 2009 that you did in fact “push” Ms Temple.
Taking into account your physical
stature and the fact, that as Mr
Wakefield’s foreman, in his absence, you were Ms Temple’s
supervisor, we believe your
conduct was improper in relation to racing.
The stewards in the letter also determined that in fact Ms Temple did throw a
bucket at Mr Sawden and found that they could not be
satisfied that the actions
of Sawden were proportional to those of Ms Temple. The letter then embarked
upon an issue concerning
procedural fairness and invited subsequently written
submissions from Mr Sawden in respect to a penalty that may be imposed.
That penalty was imposed during the phone enquiry resumption of 29 May when
Mr Sawden’s licence was disqualified for a period
of three months.
This appeal was lodged as a result of that determination.
The incident occurred in January and a finding of guilt was imposed on
29 May. It appeared from all of the evidence in the transcript
supporting exhibits that the Inquiry itself was somewhat convoluted and
disjointed. Of concern to the Tribunal was the apparent
lack of opportunity
afforded to Mr Sawden to enable him to actually confront his complainant and
cross-examine her. It is accepted
that she was telephoned during the course of
his evidence being given but that, in our opinion, is not appropriate.
There is no doubt that Mr Sawden acted in a manner contrary to accepted
principles. Had he simply not entertained a disputation process
with Ms Temple
and left the matter to abide the return of Mr Wakefield then that would have
been the end of the issue altogether.
He elected however to take matters into
his own hands and he did, as the stewards subsequently found, act improperly in
circumstances.
The matter raised considerable difficulty for the stewards to determine. In
reaching the penalty that was imposed the perception
was that there was no doubt
that Mr Sawden was the sole aggressor and it was completely overlooked that
there had been a personal
relationship between Sawden and the complainant, that
the complainant had contributed to the exacerbation of the dispute. It is
that reason that this Tribunal considers that the penalty of three months
disqualification was not appropriate. The penalty
more appropriately should
have been two months and that period of time is substituted by way of penalty
together with an order that
the deposit be refunded to Mr Sawden.
