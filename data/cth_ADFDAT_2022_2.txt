REASONS FOR
(REVISED FROM TRANSCRIPT)
THE TRIBUNAL:
reasons which will be elaborated and published in due course, and in
circumstances where the appellant no longer presses the grounds
conviction was unreasonable or unsafe and unsatisfactory, the Tribunal is of the
view that the Defence Force Magistrate
erred in the application of the
Liberato v The Queen
[1985] HCA 66
(1985) 159 CLR 507
direction in that he did not
address the second limb and did not disbelieve the accused, as distinct from
finding his evidence unconvincing,
before proceeding to the third limb. The
Tribunal is, therefore, satisfied that the appeal must succeed, at least on that
and that there ought to be a new trial. In so doing, it records that
this does not reflect the slightest on the credibility of the
complainant.
