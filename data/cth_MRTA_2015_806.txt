for Immigration on 20 August 2014 to refuse to
grant the applicants Business
Skills (Residence) (Class DF) Subclass 892 visas under
applicants applied for the visa on 17 March 2014. The application was made on
the basis of the first named applicant’s (the
applicant’s) interest
and involvement in L&F Best International Pty Ltd as a ‘main
business’. The delegate
refused to grant the visas on the basis that the
applicant did not satisfy cl.892.211 of Schedule 2 to the
Migration Regulations
(the Regulations). The delegate found that the applicant did not meet
cl.892.212 because the delegate was not satisfied that the
net value of the
business and personal assets of the applicant and his spouse were at least
$250,000. Neither was the delegate satisfied
that the assets owned by the
applicant and his spouse in the main businesses had a net value of at least
$75,000 throughout the relevant
12 month period.

present arguments. The Tribunal hearing was conducted with
the assistance of an
interpreter in the Mandarin and English languages.
the following reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the matter should be
remitted for reconsideration.
CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE
issue in the present case is whether the applicant meets the requirements in
cl.892.212. These provisions state as follows:

6 March 2014, the Victorian Department of State Development, Business and
Innovation, being the appropriate regional authority
in this case, approved the
applicant’s application for State Sponsorship. On the relevant form (form
949), it was indicated
that there were no exceptional circumstances that applied
and it had decided not to waive the requirement under cl.892.212 of the
Regulations. The applicant must therefore provide evidence that two of the three
requirements set out above are met.
applicant is not claiming to meet the employment requirements needed to satisfy
cl.892.212(a), being one of three alternative
pathways, two of which must be
established. Accordingly, in order to meet cl.892.212, the applicant must have
the minimum net value
of business and personal assets required under
cl.892.212(b); and also the minimum net value of assets owned in the main
in Australia requirements cl.892.212(c).
The visa application and evidence before the Department
visa application was lodged on 17 March 2014. The applicant included his spouse
and child in the application. The applicant nominated
L&F Best International
Pty Ltd (L&F) as his ‘main business’. An extract from the
Australian Securities and Investment
Commission (ASIC) establishes that the
applicant held all the shares in the business as at the date of the search. The
company was
registered on 1 April 2011.

and ended on 16 March 2014.

had net assets in the business of $336,840.00
in 2014. The net assets in the
business for this point in time was stated to comprise the balance of loans
advanced to the business
by the applicant in the sum of $311,278, together with
a figure of 100% ownership share by the applicant and his spouse in the business
of $25,562.
the point in time one year prior to the visa application, the net assets in the
business was stated to comprise the balance of

by the applicant
and his spouse in the sum of $8,109.

delegate initially had regard to evidence provided by the applicant in the form
of financial statements for the main business,
L&F as at 28 February 2014
and 28 February 2013, indicating net assets of the business as $25,562 a time of
application and $8,109
at the time 12 months prior to application.
Claim in relation to “Other Receivables”
statement of financial position (SALP) dated 28 February 2014 listed
“other receivables” in the sum of $93,239 at time
of application and
$150,054.12 months previously.
8 July 2014 the delegate requested further information from the applicant. This
included additional evidence concerning the amount
claimed as other receivables
in addition to a ledger provided by the applicant. The delegate requested
evidence of the claimed receivables
at both points in time capable of being
substantiated by evidence such as contracts, evidence of shipment or tax
invoices issued.
1 August 2014 the applicant provided a table of accounts receivable listing 19
total items. The table set out a total of 10 receivables
relevant to the period
immediately prior to application in the sum of $93,239.28. The delegate
determined that of this amount, it
was only prepared to accept transaction
number 19, being a receivable concerning the period immediately prior to the
application
in the sum of $13,041.60, which had been properly evidenced by a
Bill of Lading, as evidence of shipment, and a contract with the
buyer, as well
the relevant tax invoice. However, in relation to other receivables claimed the
applicant failed to provide any other
evidence which had been requested such as
contracts and shipment evidence. The delegate determined that the tax invoices
were not sufficient evidence of the claimed receivables.
relation to Receivables claimed for the period of 12 months prior to the
application, listed as $150,054.34, the delegate determined
that tax invoices
alone were insufficient in the absence of corroborative evidence such as
contracts or evidence of shipment. In
addition, a receivable listed in the sum
of $63,660.46, being a personal loan to an individual concerning a property
settlement was
determined not to be relevant as part of the activities of the
main business in providing goods and/or services connected with
Claim in relation to the applicant’s loans to
the business
delegate also had regard to the applicant’s claim to be relying upon loans
made by the applicant to the business in order
to meet both the net business
asset requirement of $75,000 and the net business and personal asset requirement
of $250,000.
delegate noted policy indicating that the legislation allows for the value of
any loans the applicant has made to the main business
to be added to the net
value of the business.
general ledger provided by the applicant indicated a loan to the business of
$311,278.28 at the point immediately prior to the
application and a loan to the
business in the sum of $188,585.26 in relation to the period 12 months before
the application.
noting both a loan ledger and bank statements for the business showing credit of
funds for the entries lodged in the loan ledger,
the delegate requested
supporting evidence such as corresponding transfers from the applicant’s
account for 14 particular transactions
identified on the loan ledger provided by
the applicant.
evidence provided by the applicant to the Department on 1 August 2014 was
satisfactory in relation to the claimed loans by the
applicant to the business
in the sum of $188,585.26 as at 28 February 2013.
although all but one of the claimed loans on the ledger were accepted as
satisfactory evidence of the applicant’s loans
to the business, item
number 30 in the sum of $20,000 in the ledger against the date 27 September 2013
was not accepted, because
the corresponding record was not supported by evidence
of a bank statement identifying the year of the statement (Part 4, f.92).
figure of $20,000 was accordingly discounted for the purposes of evidence of the
applicant’s loan to the business as at
28 February 2014, reducing the
figure from $311,278.28 to $291,278. (Amongst the additional evidence provided
to the Tribunal, discussed
below was evidence establishing that this figure of
$20,000 was indeed referable to the relevant 12 month period concerning the
applicant’s
loan to the business).
Accordingly,
the delegate found that the applicant’s net assets in the main business as
at 28 February 2013 including the net
business assets and the loan to the
company was $46,640.26. The delegate further found that as at 28 February 2014
the applicant’s
net assets in the main business was $236,643.
net business assets was below the required amount of $75,000 and net business
and personal assets below the required amount of
$250 000, the delegate found
the applicant did not meet cl.892.212(b) or (c).
The application before the Tribunal
to the hearing in the review, the applicant through his representative provided
an extensive array of further materials. This
included a legal submission

Applicant’s
individual bank statement and company bank statement dated 27 Sep
submissions relevantly stated the following:
The main reason [for
the delegate’s decision to refuse] was...[the fact that the] nominated
main business...was unable to "provided
contracts with the claimed Australian
and overseas buyers and there is no evidence of sending the goods overseas".
[The delegate]
was "not satisfied that the applicant has supplied the goods to
the buyers or was providing a service to the claimed clients". As
accounts receivable of $150,054 as at 28 Feb 2013 and $80,197.68 as at 28 Feb
2014 was disregarded from Mr. Li's business
assets, leading his failure to
satisfy Clause 892.212(b) & (c).
However [the Delegate] disregarded the fact that Mr. Li personally visited
his suppliers, made orders on the spot and he had made
arrangement for his
purchased goods delivered to his buyers. Purchase & supply invoices were in
place to sufficiently represent
the occurrence of business international trading
transactions, demonstrating the trading activities have actually happened and
not be disregarded. Nowadays e-Commerce and express post are common
practice in international trading industry. Mr. Li has spent
numerous time and
effort to liaise with his Chinese buyers and source their products. Adapting a
new logistic method should not be
the reason to prejudice Mr. Li from supplying
his goods to buyers.
Furthermore, Mr. Li was able to recover first year's account receivable by
the end of 30 Sep 2013, as well as his second year's account
receivable as at
the end of 30 Jun 2014. According to the
as long as the
accounts receivable was recovered it should not be disregarded. Therefore, Mr.
Li's account receivable was not bad
debt and should be regarded as part of his
accountant in his letter dated 27 May 2015 further opined:
Explanation of Net Asset, Account Receivable and Bad
As...for the explanation of Account Receivable, Bad Debts and Net Asset as at
28 February 2013 and 28 February 2014, I am writing
to explain your concern over
the items above in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards Board
(AASB)'s regulations.
Account Receivable:
According to AASB 101.59,
'Current assets include assets (such as
inventories and trade receivables) that are sold, consumed or realised as part
of the normal
operating cycle even when they are not expected to be realised
within twelve months after the reporting date.
'. Money owed by customers
(individuals or corporations) to another entity in exchange for goods or
services that have been delivered
or used, but not yet paid for. Receivables
usually come in the form of operating lines of credit and are usually due within
a relatively
short time period.
In accordance with AASB 139.14,
'An entity shall recognise a financial
asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when, and
the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
In this case, only $63,660.46 should not be recognized as account receivable,
because it is actually the director's personal loan
from the company. The loan
has been fully paid with interest on 28 Feb 2013. Account Receivables of
$150,054 as at 28 February 2013
would be $913,93.54 after the director's
According to AASB 1032,
'Bad debts are written off when identified. If a
provision for impairment has been recognised in relation to a loan, write-offs
bad debts are made against the provision. If no provision for impairment has
previously been recognised, write-offs for bad debts
are recognised as expenses
in the profit and loss account'.
An expense is classified as transactions to
the extent they are it is mutually agreed, otherwise they are it is classified
economic flows. The account receivables have been collected from buyers
within 12 months, therefore bad debts are not existed in
According to AASB 1004.A, the definition of contributions by owners is that
'Future economic benefits that have been contributed to the entity by parties
external to the entity, other than those which result
in liabilities of the
entity, that give rise to a financial interest in the net assets of the entity
(a) conveys entitlement both to distributions of future economic benefits
by the entity during its life, such distributions being
at the discretion of the
ownership group or its representatives, and to distributions of any excess of
assets over liabilities in
the event of the entity being wound up;
(b) can be sold, transferred to redeemed.'
Net Asset is total assets minus total liabilities shown on Statement of
Financial Position. Net assets are virtually the same as shareholders'
equity--both reflect the difference between what the company owns and what it
owes. Net asset presented on the financial statements
can be referred as
contributions by owners.
Result after reconciliation
Net Asset + Director Loan as at 28 Feb 2013 = $8,109 + $129,424.8 =
Net Asset + Director Loan as at 28 Feb 2014 = $25,562 + $311,278.28 =
$336,840.28
As the calculation above, Account Receivables and Director Loan as at 28 Feb
2013 minus $63,660.46 respectively. Therefore Account
Receivables as at 28 Feb
2013 should be $91,393.54. The outcome of reconciliation is that Company's asset
would be decreased by $63,660.46
and personal asset would be increased by
$63,660.46 in the meanwhile.
Net value of business and personal assets
the core of the concern for the Delegate was what weight could be attributed to
claims made in relation to Accounts Receivable
over the relevant period.
Fundamentally, the applicant’s claim to satisfy the relevant criteria in
cl.892.212 (b) and (c) stands
or falls depending on whether the requisite amount
of assets claimed by reference to Accounts Receivable over the relevant period
is made out.
the Tribunal’s view, although the claims in relation to Accounts
Receivable were not supported by evidence provided to the
Department that was
sufficiently clear or capable of substantiation, the Tribunal has had the
benefit of a significant volume of
further material both going to provide an
explanation as to how the applicant has been conducting and operating the main
and to substantiate the monies claimed in relation to Accounts
Receivable. The Tribunal in this regard has given weight to the subsequent
evidence of receipt of monies by the main business that were listed in the
category of Accounts Receivable. The Tribunal notes the
decision of
Immigration Review Tribunal
[1991] FCA 755
in which O'Loughlin J quoted
Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Pochi
[1980] FCA 85
(1980) 4 ALD 139
at 160, and indicated that the Tribunal may have regard to the subsequent
history (relevantly here, of a spousal relationship) for
the purpose of testing
or determining whether the relationship was genuine at the time of application.
The Tribunal considers this
relevant to the question of determining whether
Accounts Receivable were indeed receivable even if not received during the
12 month period, but where subsequent evidence "tends logically to show
the existence...of facts relevant to the issue to be determined".
Tribunal has also in particular considered and given weight to the evidence
provided by the Accountant engaged by the applicant,
who is a member of the
National Institute of Accountants Australia. The Tribunal accepts on the basis
of the accountant’s explanation
coupled with the documentary materials
provided to the Tribunal that in the relevant 12 month period prior to the
application of
the net value of the business and personal assets in Australia of
the applicant was $261,392 at the start of this period and $342,883
of this period. As the Tribunal is satisfied that the net value of business and
personal assets in Australia was at all
relevant times above $250,000, the
Tribunal finds that the applicant thereby satisfies the requirements of
cl.892.212(b)(i) and (ii).
to whether the relevant assets of the applicant have been lawfully acquired, a
large number of banking records, tax invoices, and
other documents were provided
indicating funds generated as a product of legitimate trade and commerce. There
is nothing before the
Tribunal to suggest that the assets have not been lawfully
acquired. Given this, the Tribunal is satisfied that the assets have been
lawfully acquired by the applicant and/or his spouse for the purposes of
cl.892.212(b)(iii).
Tribunal is accordingly satisfied that the requirements of cl.892.212(b) are
Net value of assets owned in the main business in Australia
Furthermore,
the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence referred to above that the assets
owned by the applicant in the main business
were $137,534 at the start of the
relevant 12 month period and were $336,840 at the time of application. As the
Tribunal is satisfied
that the net value of the assets owned by the applicant in
the main business was at all relevant times at least $75,000, the Tribunal
that the applicant satisfies the requirements of cl.892.212(c)(i) and (ii).
relation to lawful acquisition, the Tribunal refers to and repeats its findings
above and is satisfied that the assets have been
lawfully acquired by the
applicant and/or his spouse for the purposes of cl.892.212(c)(iii).
Tribunal is accordingly satisfied that the requirements of cl.892.212(c) are
applicant therefore meets cl.892.212 in its entirety. In these circumstances,
the Tribunal will remit the application to the Department
to consider the
remaining visa criteria to be met by the first named applicant and the secondary
applicants joined as members of
his family unit.
Tribunal remits the applications for Business Skills (Residence) (Class DF)
visas for reconsideration, with the direction that
the first named applicant
meets the following criteria for a Subclass State/Territory Sponsored Business
Owner (Residence) visa:
