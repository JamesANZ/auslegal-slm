REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
dispute arises as to the date on which the present application was filed. It is
an application signed by the applicant on 17 February
2013. It was faxed by her
to the Registry of the court at 17:40 on 18 February 2013. The Registry stamped
it as filed on 26 February
2013. The applicant contends that it was filed no
later than 19 February 2013. The respondent contends that it was filed on 26
February 2013.
application itself applies to set aside a Bankruptcy Notice dated 21 December
2012 served on the applicant on 29 January 2013.
It is common ground that the
last date for compliance is 19 January 2013. It is also common ground that the
last date for the applicant
to apply to extend the time for compliance, or to
set aside, the Bankruptcy Notice is 19 January 2013.
applicant resides in Trundle, NSW. It is uncontentious that Trundle is a small
town in the Parkes Shire of the Central West of
NSW and is about 420km west of
Sydney. The applicant is self-represented, describes herself as undertaking
an intelligent and articulate person.

a bankruptcy notice:
proceedings to set aside a judgment or order in respect of which the bankruptcy
notice was issued have been instituted by the
an application has been made to the Court to set aside the bankruptcy notice;
power to extend time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice under
the Act is expressly disallowed, and thus the authorities state that failure to
comply with

“fatal to jurisdiction”: Re Shaddock;
Shaddock v Commonwealth Bank of Australia

Australia, Goldberg J, 9 April 1998). In other words this court lacks the power
to set aside the bankruptcy
notice unless the application was filed before the
expiration of the time fixed for compliance with the requirements of the
respondent contends that pursuant to r.2.05(2)
Federal Magistrate Court Rules
the application was not filed until 25 February 2013 being the date
that it was sealed. Rule 2.05(2) states:
is filed when it is accepted for filing by a Registrar and sealed with the seal
of the Court or marked with a Federal
Magistrates Court stamp as required by
Division 2.4.
applicant contends that, pursuant to r.2.05(3) the application was

court may dispense with compliance with its rules. In this regard r.1.06(1)
may in the interests of justice dispense with compliance, or full compliance,
with any of these Rules at any time.
court declines to do so, however, on the facts of this case. As indicated
above, failure to comply with s.41(6A) is not a procedural
irregularity, it goes
to the question of whether the court’s jurisdiction has been validly

the application has been filed on time therefore stands to be determined by
reference to
Federal Magistrate Court Rules 2001 rr.2.05(2) and (3)
respondent accepts that the application was filed by facsimile, but argues that
r.2.05(2) is clear on its terms ie. filing
occurs when the court’s seal is
affixed to the document, and thus it was filed on 26 February 2013.
application is supported by the applicant’s affidavit sworn 15 March 2013
in which she annexes some documents that provide
some explanation as to why
there was a delay between the date of faxing, and the date of sealing. It is
clear, for example, that
the court received the application no later than 19
February 2013. It is also clear that the applicant submitted an Application
Exemption from Paying Court Fees – Financial Hardship which is dated 18
February 2013. That application was granted on
26 February 2013. The precise
reason for the delay is not clear, but there is some suggestion that the
registry sought further information
from the applicant, and that there was a
delay in communication and in the provision of that information.
2.06 of the
Federal Court and
Federal Magistrates Court Regulations
deals with persons exempt from paying a fee and states:
a fee mentioned in Schedule 1 is payable by an individual in relation to a
proceeding; and
in the opinion of the Registrar or authorised officer of the relevant court at
the time the fee is payable, the payment of
the fee would cause financial
hardship to the individual;
Registrar or authorised officer may exempt the individual from paying the fee.
In considering whether payment of a fee would cause financial hardship to an
individual, the Registrar or authorised officer
must consider the individual's
income, day-to-day living expenses, liabilities and assets.
Application for Exemption form itself gives notice to the applicant about what
needs to be demonstrated in order to establish
financial hardship. Relevantly
the form states
“where possible provide documentary evidence to support
general claims...”.
It also warns the applicant that the Registrar
“may ask you to provide additional documentary evidence to support your
and the form itself contains a
“Notice of request for
more information”.
The document attached to the applicant’s
affidavit suggests such a request was made, presumably on or after 19 February
before the time of filing on the 26
February 2013.
The applicant submits that it is important to note that immediately below the
“Notice of request for more information”
there appears the
printed words:
“The documents listed above should be provided within 14
days of the date on which this notice was issued”.
The applicant thus
contends that, as a self-represented litigant, she was under the impression that
filing took place once she sent
the application by facsimile, and that the date
of filing could not depend on how long the registry took to process her
application
for exemption from fees. Indeed her assertion was that the
exemption form itself in effect lulled her into a false sense of security

is a deeming provision.
Note to sub-rule (3) expressly contemplates the possibility of a delay between
transmission by electronic communication and the
time the document is filed.
The court does not, however, read the Note as limiting the interpretation of the
sub-rule to just the
situation of computer security firewalls. The Note in this
regard is no more than an example for the purposes of s.15AD

documents. Thus

respondent submits that the application was not
for the purposes of r.2.05(3) until 26 February 2013 when it was stamped in
accordance with r.2.05(2). The difficulty with this interpretation
renders meaningless the deeming provisions

regard to the above, and based on the facts of the present case, the application
that was sent by facsimile on 18 February
2013 must be deemed pursuant to
Federal Magistrates Court Rules
r.2.05(3) to have been filed on 19
February 2013, even though the court’s stamp was not affixed until 26

on a future date.
