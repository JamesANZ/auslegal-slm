Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding) Bill
This bill seeks to establish the regulatory framework to facilitate
crowd-sourced funding offers by small unlisted public companies,
provides new
public companies that are eligible to crowd fund with temporary relief from
reporting and corporate governance requirements
that would normally apply and
creates new exemption powers to provide emerging financial markets with a more
tailored regulatory
and licencing framework
House of Representatives on 24 November 2016
This bill is a similar to a bill introduced in the previous
Delegation of legislative
Schedule 1, item 14, paragraphs
738G(1)(c) and 738G(1)(f)
This bill seeks to amend the
Corporations Act 2001
to facilitate
crowd-sourced funding (CSF) by small, unlisted public companies. The bill will
establish eligibility requirements for
a company to fundraise via CSF, including
disclosure requirements for CSF offers.
Proposed new
subsection 738G(1)
provides that CSF offers may be made if,
among other things:
• ‘the securities are of a class specified in the
regulations’ (proposed new paragraph 738G(1)(c)); and
• ‘any other requirements specified in the regulations are
satisfied in relation to the securities or the offer’
(proposed new
paragraph 738G(1)(f)).
In relation to proposed new paragraph 738G(1)(c), the explanatory memorandum
(at p. 16) states that it is necessary to allow the class
of securities eligible
for crowd-funding to be specified in the regulations because ‘the CSF
regime is new and is expected
to evolve quickly’ and therefore
‘there is a need to have flexibility to quickly adjust the type of
securities that are
eligible for crowd-funding’. Furthermore, it is
suggested that the power is necessary so that ‘the Government can quickly
amend the types of securities available on crowd-funding platforms to prevent a
systematic issue from arising and maintain investor
confidence’. The
committee thanks the Minister for including this additional information in the
explanatory memorandum which
was provided in response to the committee’s
comments on a similar version of this bill introduced in the previous Parliament
Second Report of 2016
at pp 64–72).
In light of this
explanation, the committee makes no further comment in relation to the
delegation of legislative power in proposed
new paragraph 738G(1)(c).
However, the committee takes this opportunity to note that there appears to
be no information in the explanatory memorandum in relation
to the broad power
in proposed new paragraph 738G(1)(f) which, as noted above, allows the
regulations to prescribe other requirements
in relation to the securities or the
CSF offer. The committee consistently expects that where important matters are
left to be specified
in regulations (rather than being included on the face of
the primary legislation) the explanatory materials should clearly explain
rationale for the delegation of legislative power.
The committee therefore
seeks the Treasurer’s advice as to the rationale for allowing the
regulations to prescribe other requirements
in relation to the securities or the
CSF offer, including examples of circumstances in which it is envisaged that
this power may
Pending the Treasurer’s advice, the committee draws Senators’
attention to the provision, as it may be considered to delegate
legislative
powers inappropriately, in breach of principle 1(a)(iv) of the committee’s
terms of reference.
