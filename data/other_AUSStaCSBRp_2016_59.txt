Attorney-General responded to the committee’s comments in a letter dated
22 November 2016. A copy of the letter is attached
to this report.
Alert Digest No. 8 of 2016 - extract
Trespass on personal rights and
liberties—reversal of evidential burden of
Schedule 1, items 8–11
Items 8 to 11 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 each introduce
a defence of proportionality to a number of existing offences. The defences will
apply if the relevant death or injury results from an attack on a military
objective, launched in circumstances where the perpetrator
reasonably did not
expect that the attack would cause excessive incidental civilian death or
injury. In a note to each of the proposed
subsections in these items it
indicates that a defendant will bear an evidential burden in relation to
establishing the matters to
make out this defence.
While the defendant bears an evidential burden (requiring the defendant to
raise evidence about the matter), rather than a legal burden
(requiring the
defendant to positively prove the matter), the committee expects, as a matter of
routine, any such reversal of the
burden of proof to be justified. The
committee’s consideration of the appropriateness of a provision which
reverses the burden
of proof is assisted if it explicitly addresses relevant
principles as set out in the
Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences,
Infringement Notices and Enforcement Powers
(see in particular pp
As neither the statement of compatibility nor the explanatory memorandum
address this issue the committee seeks a justification from
the Attorney-General
as to why the items propose to reverse the evidential burden of proof which
addresses the principles set out
Guide to Framing Commonwealth
Offences, Infringement Notices and Enforcement Powers
Attorney-General’s response - extract
The items in question introduce a defence to a number of war crimes offences
Criminal Code Act 1995
(the Code), which are engaged by conduct
which causes the death of, or injury to, a person not taking an active part in
hostilities
in a non-international armed conflict (subsections 268.70(1),
268.71(1), 268.71(2) and 268.72(1)).
The introduction of the defence aligns Australian domestic law with the
international humanitarian law principle of proportionality,
as applied to
non-international aimed conflict. It provides that the relevant offence will not
apply if death or injury results from
an attack on a military objective,
launched in circumstances where the perpetrator reasonably did not expect that
the attack would
result in the incidental death of or injury to civilians that
would have been excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military
advantage anticipated.
The relevant war crimes offences specified above are contained in Division
268 of the Code, which was enacted in 2002 to create offences
in Australian law
that are the equivalent of the international crimes provided for in the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal
Court (the Rome Statute). The elements of
those offences are closely modelled on the Elements of Crimes for the
corresponding crimes
in Article 8(2)(c)(i) of the Rome Statute. It would not be
appropriate to specify an additional element for the proof of these offences
under Australian domestic law, which required the prosecution to
‘disprove’ compliance with the principle of proportionality.
I also consider it appropriate for the burden to rest on the defendant to
point to evidence establishing the elements of this defence,
as they relate to
matters peculiarly within the defendant’s knowledge. In particular,
consistent with the requirements of the
principle of proportionality at
international law, a central element of the defence concerns the
‘expectation’ of the
perpetrator at the time of launching the attack
(that is, the defence requires that, at that time, the perpetrator did not
that the attack would cause excessive incidental civilian death or
injury). This must be a question for the defendant.
Further, in line with Australia’s Declaration in relation to Articles
Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949,
military commanders and others responsible for planning, deciding upon, or
executing attacks, must necessarily reach their decisions
on the basis of their
assessment of the information from all sources that are available to them at the
relevant time. These persons
will be best placed to raise evidence of matters
including the objective of the attack and the concrete and direct military
that was anticipated. It would be significantly more difficult for the
prosecution to disprove these matters beyond reasonable doubt.
Committee response
The committee thanks the Attorney-General for this response.
The committee notes the Attorney-General’s advice that the elements of
the offence ‘relate to matters peculiarly within
the defendant’s
knowledge’ as it relates to what the defendant expected would occur. The
committee also notes the Attorney-General’s
advice that the defendant is
best placed to raise evidence of these matters, including the objective of the
attack and the anticipated
military advantage, and that it would be
‘significantly more difficult for the prosecution to disprove these
Finally, the committee notes the Attorney-General’s advice
that the elements of the offence are closely modelled on the terms
international treaty and it would not be appropriate to specify an additional
element of proof for these offences under Australian
domestic law.
The committee requests that the key information be included in the
explanatory memorandum, noting the importance of these documents
as a point of
access to understanding the law and, if needed, as extrinsic material to assist
with interpretation (see
section 15AB
Acts Interpretation Act
In light of the explanation provided the committee leaves the
appropriateness of reversing the evidential burden of proof to the consideration
of the Senate as a whole.
