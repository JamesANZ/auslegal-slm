[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
Volkswagen Australia (VW) supplied to consumers in Australia various models
of Volkswagen vehicles manufactured by its German parent
company Volkswagen
Aktiengesellschaft (VW AG) fitted with driver side airbags manufactured by
Takata Corporation or its related entities
(Takata). Those airbags were designed
by Takata to be inflated by gas generated by the ignition of a propellant inside
inflator known as phase stabilised ammonium nitrate (PSAN).
In February 2016, VW AG commenced an empirical analysis program, involving
some 20,000 airbags retrieved from the field worldwide
for the purpose of
investigating whether the PSAN used in the airbags in Volkswagen vehicles posed
a safety risk. VW AG determined
that there was no systemic safety risk
associated with the Takata airbags installed in Volkswagen vehicles that would
warrant their
recall. However, following a recall notice issued in February 2018
by the Assistant Minister to the Commonwealth Treasurer in relation
class of vehicles, including some Volkswagen vehicles, VW initiated a recall
program of its models in Australia containing
the affected Takata airbags and
progressively replaced the airbags in those vehicles, at no cost (subject to a
small number of exceptions
where VW had applied to the Australian Competition
and Consumer Commission for an exemption).
The appellant, Prof Dwyer, acquired a VW Passat vehicle for approximately
$40,000 in 2013. He commenced representative proceedings
against VW on behalf of
members of a group consisting of some 83,000 persons who purchased various
models of new and second-hand
Volkswagen vehicles in Australia between 2007 and
2018 (the VW Vehicles). The appellant claimed that his vehicle was not safe and
free from defects, given the installation of the Takata airbag, and therefore
did not comply with the consumer guarantee of “acceptable
of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). He claimed that the use of PSAN as
the propellant in the Takata airbags installed in the VW
Vehicles created a risk
of mis-deployment or rupture of the airbag, and that risk was present at the
time of purchase. The risk was
said to arise because PSAN has a propensity to
degrade over time when exposed to moisture and temperature fluctuations and, if
PSAN degraded sufficiently, it could burn so aggressively that the airbag
inflator could rupture in a life-threatening way. The appellant
accepted that
the alleged risk was unquantifiable in that it cannot be predicted when and in
what circumstances the PSAN in the airbags
in the VW Vehicles might degrade to a
functionally significant degree.
The appellant sought damages for himself and on behalf of relevant group
members under
of the ACL for any reduction in the value of his vehicle
resulting from the failure to comply with the consumer guarantee and for
consequential loss. He also sought damages under s 74D of the
Trade Practices
(Cth) on behalf of group members who purchased their vehicles
before 1 January 2011 for alleged breach of the warranty of “merchantable
The primary judge rejected the appellant’s claim. His Honour found that
the appellant had not established any link between the
propensity of PSAN to
degrade and any relevant, functionally significant, propensity of the PSAN to
degrade in the particular airbag
installed in the appellant’s vehicle so
as to cause it to rupture or malfunction. His Honour also made contingent
that if the acceptable quality guarantee had been breached (i) VW would
have the benefit of the defence in s 271(2)(a) of the ACL,
as the assumed
failure to comply with the acceptable quality guarantee occurred “only
because of” “an act, default
or omission of ... any person other
than the manufacturer”, relevantly, Takata; and (ii) the appellant had not
established
an entitlement to damages as referred to in s 272 of the ACL. The
common questions in the proceedings were answered adversely to
the appellant and
group members and the proceedings were dismissed with costs.
On appeal, Prof Dwyer limited his case on breach of the acceptable quality
guarantee to the alleged risk of rupture of the airbags
in the VW Vehicles.
The Court held
(Gleeson JA, Leeming and White JJA agreeing),
dismissing the appeal:
As to the acceptable quality guarantee
(1) There was no error by the primary judge in finding that
the results of VW AG’s empirical analysis program suggested, very
strongly, that there was no reason to predict that the airbag inflators
installed in Volkswagen vehicles will become critical or
dangerous: [127].
(2) Although unacceptable quality may be demonstrated on the
basis of an inherent risk associated with a product without that risk
having materialised, it is first necessary to establish that the product carries
the inherent risk alleged: [146].

(2003) 130 FCR 182
[2003] FCAFC 151
Protec Pacific Pty Ltd v Steuler Services GmbH & Co KG
[2014] VSCA
, considered.
(3) The appellant failed to prove that the airbags in the VW
Vehicles carried the inherent risk alleged. The appellant’s expert,
Mr Renz, accepted that he could not say that degradation would reach a
point of functional significance at any identifiable point
in time, let alone
within the service life of any of the VW Vehicles: [100], [147].
(4) The primary judge did not err in finding that the
appellant had failed to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the
or risk of PSAN to degrade in the presence of moisture and
temperature changes would materialise at any identifiable point in time
VW Vehicles: [148].
(5) The appellant’s contention that there was an
unquantifiable risk of serious harm because the risk of rupture had not been
excluded for the realistic life of the good reversed the onus of proof. There
was no error in the primary judge’s finding that
the appellant had not
sought to demonstrate that the alleged risk could eventuate during any
meaningful timeframe: [153].
(6) His Honour was correct to conclude that the appellant
had failed to establish a breach of the acceptable quality guarantee in
A merely speculative theoretical possibility of a risk of rupture of the
airbag, not within any meaningful timeframe, would not be
regarded as
unacceptable by a reasonable consumer: [151], [154]-[156].
As to the applicability of the defence in s 271(2)(a)
(7) The phrase “only because of” in s 271(2)(a)
is a relational term. The manufacturer’s defence in s 271(2)(a)
attention to the fact or facts which made the goods of unacceptable quality
under the consumer guarantee. Having identified
the fact or facts, the question
is whether the goods were not of acceptable quality
an act, default or omission of any person, other than the manufacturer,
or an employee or agent of the manufacturer. If the sole
cause of what made the
goods non-compliant with the consumer guarantee is an act, default or omission
of a third party supplier of
a component of the goods who is not the agent of
the manufacturer, there is no reason to deny the defence to the manufacturer:
[172]-[186].
(8) The reference to the “manufacturer” in
s 271(2)(a) should be read distributively to include both the actual
manufacturer
of the vehicles located overseas (here, VW AG) and the importer of
the vehicles (here, VW) at a time when the actual manufacturer
did not have a
place of business in Australia: [176]-[182].
(9) Assuming a breach of the consumer guarantee had been
established, the acts of VW AG in choosing Takata as a third party supplier
the airbags, installing the airbags as manufactured by Takata and releasing the
vehicles in that state for supply to consumers
were not what made the VW
Vehicles of unacceptable quality (assuming breach of the consumer guarantee had
been established). That
argument confused those steps taken by VW AG, which are
a necessary precondition of liability for any failure to comply with the
consumer guarantee of acceptable quality, with the question of whether the
vehicle was non-compliant with the consumer guarantee
because of an
act, default or omission of any person other than the manufacturer:
[188]-[195].
As to damages under s 272(1)
(10) Since it was common ground that the time for the
assessment of any reduction in value of the goods under s 272(1)(a) is the
of supply, it is not necessary to consider whether a departure from the time of
supply as the time of the assessment of damages
may be required in some cases:

(11) Given the resemblance between the two components of
damages referred to in s 272(1)(a) and (b) and compensatory damages available
common law for breach of contract, it is appropriate to draw upon general law
notions of compensation, by way of analogy, when
assessing statutory damages
under s 272(1): [227], [230]-[232], [240].

(12) By analogy with common law principles, subsequent
events which illuminate, indicate or reflect the true value of the good,
time of supply, may be taken into account under s 272(1)(a) when assessing any
reduction in value, at the time of supply.
However, subsequent events as a
consequence of independent, extrinsic, supervening or accidental factors must
not be taken into account.
Whether a subsequent event truly illuminates or
indicates or reflects the measure of loss earlier suffered depends on all the
circumstances:

(13) To disregard subsequent events which illuminate,
indicate or reflect the true value of the good, at the time of supply, would
inconsistent with the “universal rule” that a plaintiff cannot
recover more than he or she has lost. There is no reason
to consider that s 272,
like similar remedial provisions within
of Ch 5 of the ACL, was intended
to be inconsistent with that “strong principle”: [237]-[239].

, considered.
(14) A motor vehicle is a mechanically complex product that
requires maintenance in order to remain safe for use, and frequently
repaired or replaced during its lifetime. Given that a vehicle should remain
safe for use, it is inherent in the nature
of a vehicle that upon recognising a
latent defect, the defective part will be repaired or replaced as necessary.
Assuming the airbag
in the appellant’s vehicle was a latent defect, that
is what occurred in this case. On the assumption that there was a breach
acceptable quality guarantee, that was an event that arose from the nature of
the vehicle: [241]-[244].
(15) There was no error by the primary judge in taking into
account the replacement of the airbag, at no cost, when assessing damage
reduction in value of the appellant’s vehicle, at the time of supply, as
referred to in s 272(1)(a). In any event,
the appellant had not established his
claim for any reduction in value damages under s 272(1)(a): [245], [255],
[260]-[261].
(16) The appellant’s alternative claim for damages
based on the “left in the hand” approach did not fall within
terms of s 272(1)(a). To the extent that this claim was made under s 272(1)(b),
it was not pressed in oral submissions, and had
this claim been pressed, (i) it
should not be permitted as a new point on appeal as it could possibly have been
met by calling evidence
at the hearing, and (ii) such a claim is not within s
271(1)(b) because it assumes a no transaction case, contrary to the premise
272(1), and, by reason of s 272(3), a claim based the reduction in value can
only be made under s 272(1)(a) and not s 272(1)(b):
[267]-[275].
(17) The appellant’s claims for excess financing costs
(interest) and excess taxes (GST and stamp duty) under s 272(2)(b)
were not run
at trial, pleaded, or specified in the common questions. The appellant should
not be permitted to advance these claims
as new points on appeal: [281],
[289]-[293].
(18) In any event, insofar as the claim for excess interest
was based on the difference between the purchase price and the
value of the appellant’s vehicle, at the time of
supply, the claim could not succeed because the appellant had failed to
that his vehicle’s true value was less than what he paid for it,
at the time of supply. Insofar as the claim was for interest
on the cost of
repair, that claim could not succeed because the appellant was never “out
of my money”, nor were any of
the group members, as the airbags had been
replaced by VW, at no cost: [282]-[283].
(19) The appellant’s contention that the common
questions can now be amended to include the new claims is unsound because
ignores the effect of
Civil Procedure Act 2005
(NSW). Group
members are bound by a statutory estoppel on the issues raised by common
questions 17, 19 and 20A, which concerned loss
and damage under s 272(1)(a) and
(b): [294]-[298].

(20) Moreover, the appellant made no application at trial or
following the primary judgment to amend the common questions, and there
ground of appeal contending that the primary judge erred in not amending the
common questions. Although
Supreme Court Act
(NSW) provides that this Court on an appeal by way of rehearing has the same
powers as the primary judge, and this includes the power
of amendment, there is
no occasion to consider amending the common questions following the trial and
dismissal of the proceedings.
The appellant did not make an application in this
Court for leave to amend the common questions to include the new claims for GST
and stamp duty: [303]-[306].
This appeal concerns a representative proceeding brought by Prof Philip
Dwyer as a representative plaintiff against Volkswagen Group
Australia Pty Ltd
(VW) claiming damages for himself and on behalf of group members in respect of
the supply of Volkswagen motor vehicles
which were alleged not to be of
acceptable quality or, in some cases, merchantable quality, because the airbags
fitted to the vehicles
carried a risk of mis-deployment or rupture. Following
delivery of his principal judgment on 18 June 2018 and a second judgment on
September 2021, the primary judge made final orders on 16 September 2021
determining the common questions in the proceedings adversely
to the plaintiff
and group members and dismissed the proceedings with costs. Prof Dwyer appeals
against those orders and the answers
to some of the common
Nature of the case
imported into Australia various models of Volkswagen vehicles manufactured by
its German parent company, Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft
(VW AG). In October
2013, Prof Dwyer (the appellant) purchased a Volkswagen Passat from VW for
approximately $40,000. Some 83,000
group members in the representative
proceeding purchased various models of new and second-hand Volkswagen vehicles
in Australia between
2007 and 2018 (the VW Vehicles). The VW Vehicles were
fitted with driver side airbags manufactured by Takata Corporation or its
entities (Takata). Those airbags contained a propellant known as phase
stabilised ammonium nitrate (PSAN).
appellant commenced a representative proceeding against VW under
Civil Procedure Act 2005
(NSW). He sought damages for himself and on
behalf of group members claiming that the VW Vehicles supplied from
1 January 2011, including
his own, failed to comply with the consumer
guarantee of acceptable quality in
Australian Consumer Law
(ACL) because the vehicles were not safe and free from defects, given the
installation of the Takata airbag. He also claimed that
the supply of the VW
Vehicles to group members prior to 1 January 2011 was a breach of the
statutory warranty of merchantable quality
in s 74D the
Trade Practices Act
(Cth) (TPA). It was common ground that any distinction between the
concepts of “merchantable” and “acceptable”
quality was
not material for the purpose of the proceedings.
questions for determination at the trial before Stevenson J were all those
arising on the appellant’s claims and the questions
common to the
appellant’s and group members’ claims identified in consent orders
made by Sackar J on 21 June 2019, as
varied on 22 May 2020.
appellant’s case was that the use of PSAN as the propellant in the airbags
created a risk of mis-deployment or rupture of
the airbag, and that risk was
present at the time he purchased his vehicle. He contended that:
(a) the PSAN propellant had a propensity to degrade over time when exposed to
moisture and temperature fluctuations; and
(b) if the PSAN degraded sufficiently, the PSAN could burn so aggressively that
the inflator housing could rupture in a life-threatening
appellant accepted at trial that the risk of mis-deployment or rupture of the
airbags in the VW Vehicles is unquantifiable in
that it cannot be predicted when
and in what circumstances the PSAN in the airbags might degrade to a
functionally significant degree.
On his case, this is what made the VW Vehicles
of unacceptable quality.
appellant and each group member had used their vehicle since purchase without
incident. In the circumstances explained below,
VW replaced the airbag in the
appellant’s vehicle at no cost during a routine service in 2019. By the
time of the trial (in
May 2021), VW had replaced the airbags in each group
member’s vehicle, subject to some exceptional cases: see [28] below.
primary judge rejected the appellant’s claim (
Dwyer v Volkswagen Group
Australia Pty Ltd t/as Volkswagen Australia
[2021] NSWSC 715).
principal judgment, his Honour concluded (at [14]) that the appellant had not
established any link between the propensity
of PSAN to degrade and any relevant,
functionally significant propensity of the PSAN to degrade in the particular
airbag installed
in his vehicle so as to cause it to explode or malfunction.
Therefore, the appellant had not established that his vehicle was not
acceptable quality when he purchased it.
the possibility that this conclusion was wrong, his Honour went on to deal with
two further issues. Assuming breach of the
guarantee of acceptable quality, his
Honour found that the defence relied on by VW under s 271(2)(a) of the ACL
applied, because
the assumed failure to comply with the consumer guarantee
occurred “only because of” the act, default, or omission of
person, relevantly, Takata. His Honour also found that the appellant had not
suffered any damage by reason of the installation
of a Takata airbag in his
vehicle, not least because VW had without charge replaced the Takata airbag with
an airbag that is undoubtedly
sound and, in any event, damage had not been
proved by the appellant.
his second judgment, the primary judge dealt with the question of costs and the
answers to the common questions (
Dwyer v Volkswagen Group Australia Pty Ltd
t/as Volkswagen Australia (No 2)
[2021] NSWSC 1137).
are three parts to the appeal. To the extent that it relates to questions common
to the claims of group members, the appeal
is brought as a representative
proceeding on behalf of group members:
Civil Procedure Act
s 180(1)(a).
first concerns a challenge to the findings that the appellant had failed to
establish that the VW Vehicles were not of “acceptable”
quality, or
in some cases of “merchantable” quality. The case on appeal is
limited to the alleged risk of rupture of
the airbags in the VW Vehicles; the
appellant did not press his case below concerning the alleged risk of
mis-deployment of the airbags.
second part concerns whether his Honour erred in his contingent finding that the
exception in s 271(2)(a) of the ACL would apply
to defeat the appellant’s
claim for damages, assuming that the appellant’s vehicle was not of
acceptable quality.
third part concerns whether his Honour erred in his contingent finding that the
appellant had not suffered any damage and the
adverse answers given to the claim
for damages on behalf of group members.
the reasons that follow, the appeal should be dismissed.
Structure of these reasons
structure of these reasons is:
briefly state the factual background to the proceedings;
identify the applicable legislative provisions;
explain the standard of appellate review;
provide an overview of the technical and expert evidence, and summarise his
Honour’s key findings with respect to
that evidence;
fifth, to deal
with the issues on liability relating to the asserted
of rupture of
the airbags, including the challenge to some of his Honour’s findings
concerning the technical and expert evidence
as to the propensity or risk of
PSAN to degrade in the airbags installed in the VW Vehicles so as to cause
them to rupture;
sixth, to deal
with the defence relied upon by VW under s 272(2)(a) of the ACL that any failure
to comply with the statutory guarantee
(if established) occurred
“only because of” the act, default, or omission of another person
namely, Takata; and
seventh, to deal
with the issue of damages, including the new damages claims which the appellant
sought to raise on appeal.
Factual background
primary facts are not in dispute. The following outline is largely taken from
his Honour’s unchallenged summary in the principal
judgment, supplemented
by some additional matters which provide context for the appellant’s
Takata airbags
frontal driver side Takata airbags installed in Volkswagen vehicles contained
four major subsystems: (a) an inflator; (b) a fabric
bag that inflates; (c) a
cover that matches the car’s interior and tears open in a controlled way
when the bag is inflating;
and (d) a sensor system that detects rapid
deceleration that is consistent with a crash scenario. A diagrammatic
representation of
these components, given by Mr Robert Renz, the
appellant’s expert, in Figure 2a of his report appears below.
airbag was designed to inflate upon a relevant impact by igniting the booster
and then the main PSAN propellant to produce a controlled
explosion that
generated a hot gas (a “gas generant”) to fill the airbag with
pressure within approximately 50 milliseconds
schematic cross-sectional diagram of such an inflator contained in Figure 9 of
an affidavit provided by Mr Andreas Schade, a technical
expert employed by VW
AG, appears below.
location and operation of the Takata airbags fitted in the VW Vehicles was
described by his Honour at [29]-[33]:
The Takata airbags in question were fitted to the front driver side of the
vehicles, within the steering wheel boss.
Airbags are comprised of several different components. Those components include
the inflator which, in this case, was a particular
driver airbag inflator known as a “Smokeless Driver Inflator”
The purpose of an airbag inflator is to cause gas to be generated rapidly when
there is a collision.
In the event of a collision, an ignitor within the airbag produces hot gasses.
These gasses ignite propellant tablets that cause
the propellant, here the PSAN,
to ignite and produce gas for inflating the airbag cushion.
These steps need to occur within milliseconds of the initiation of the process
by the airbag control unit.
appellant’s vehicle was manufactured by VW AG and fitted with a Takata
driver side airbag which contained PSAN as the propellant:
at [34]. Takata
manufactured the airbag installed in the appellant’s vehicle pursuant to a
contract with VW AG: [35]-[36].
The specifications given to Takata by VW AG did
not specify the propellant to be used in the airbags: at [38].
Recall of other vehicles in the United States
3 November 2015, the United States Department of Transportation National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration published a Coordinated
Remedy Order which imposed
recall and remedy obligations on certain vehicle manufacturers (not Volkswagen)
in respect of Takata airbags
installed in those vehicles. That report
As of October 30, 2015, there have been 99 confirmed incidents in the United
States where a ruptured Takata airbag inflator allegedly
caused death or injury.
Notwithstanding
the occurrence of such incidents, the appellant accepts that there has been no
reported instance of injury from a
rupture of a driver side Takata airbag
installed in a Volkswagen vehicle.
VW AG empirical analysis
February 2016, VW AG commenced an empirical analysis program for the purpose of
investigating whether the PSAN gas used in the
airbag inflators in Volkswagen
vehicles constituted a safety risk. This involved the collection and testing of
some 20,000 airbag
inflators from the field from vehicles manufactured from 2005
onwards and from various climatic zones around the world: at [67]-[68].
details of this testing program and analysis are summarised at [56]f below.
AG’s product safety committee determined that there was no systemic safety
risk associated with Takata smokeless driver inflator
(SDI) airbag inflators
installed in Volkswagen vehicles that would warrant their recall. The Court was
also informed that no European
regulator has required a recall of Volkswagens
fitted with Takata airbags: at [75]. Nevertheless, VW AG and its related
conducted recalls of vehicles fitted with Takata SDI airbag inflators
in those countries where recalls were required by relevant
authorities, including in Australia.
Recall of vehicles in
February 2018, the Assistant Minister to the Commonwealth Treasurer issued a
recall notice styled
Consumer Goods (Motor Vehicles With Affected Takata
Airbag Inflators and Specified Spare Parts) Recall Notice 2018
(Cth), which
came into effect in March 2018: at [54]. The recall notice applied to a wide
class of motor vehicles, including the VW
Vehicles, and required the recall of
“Affected Takata Airbag Inflators” including driver side airbags
that used PSAN
as a propellant to activate the airbag upon a collision: at [55].
The notice stated that it had been issued after a detailed investigation
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) into possible risks
involved in using vehicles containing Takata airbags
manufactured by Takata
Corporation of Japan: at [56].
the recall notice, VW initiated a recall program. The VW Vehicles were recalled
and the airbag inflators in them progressively
replaced by the time of trial,
subject to minor exceptions where VW had applied to the ACCC for an allowable
exemption (for example,
where the vehicle has been stolen, scrapped or where the
owner has not been able to be contacted): at [64], [66]. As of 31 December
the oldest VW Vehicle containing a Takata airbag was approximately 14 years old.
All other relevant VW Vehicles were no more
than 12 years old.
The appellant’s case
appellant’s case is that his vehicle was not as safe and free from defects
as the hypothetical reasonable consumer would
regard as acceptable because a
safety device in the vehicle for the stated purpose of minimising the risk of
injury upon collision
– the airbag – itself carried a
causing injury or death which was not present in airbags that used other
propellants.
appellant accepts that his vehicle is, by reason of replacement of the airbag,
as valuable today as it would have been had it
been supplied originally with
non-defective airbags. The appellant’s complaint is that his vehicle, at
the time of supply,
was worth less than the price he paid for it by reason of
the defective airbag installed in it. It is said that notwithstanding the
replacement of the airbag some six years after purchase, the appellant has still
suffered loss and damage.
The statutory provisions
appellant’s claim for damages for himself and on behalf of the group
members who purchased their VW Vehicles from 1 January
2011, was based on a
statutory cause of action conferred by s 271 of the ACL. The damages claim
advanced on behalf of group members
who purchased their VW Vehicles prior to 1
January 2011, was based on a statutory cause of action conferred by s 74D(1) of
The applicable statutory provisions are set out below.
Australian Consumer Law
Australian Consumer Law
commenced on 1 January 2011 and is set out in Sch
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth). Section 54 provides a
consumer guarantee of acceptable quality:
54 Guarantee as to acceptable quality
(a) a person supplies, in trade or commerce, goods to a
consumer; and
(b) the supply does not occur by way of sale by auction;
there is a guarantee that the goods are of acceptable quality.
in relation to goods, as defined in
, includes “supply (including
re-supply) by way of sale, exchange, lease, hire or hire-purchase”.
as defined in
, includes “(a) ships, aircraft
and other vehicles; ... (f) second-hand goods; and (g) any component part of, or
is no dispute that these provisions were satisfied in the present case,
relevantly:
(1) the appellant and at least some group members were “consumers”
within the meaning of ACL,
(2) the VW Vehicles are “goods” as the inclusive definition of that
includes “vehicles”, which are expressly
referred to in sub-par (a) of the definition (“ships, aircraft and other
vehicles”); and
(3) VW admitted on the pleadings that the VW Vehicles were supplied in trade or
commerce, other than by way of sale by auction.
54(2) and (3) define the concept of “acceptable quality” for the
purpose of the guarantee:
(2) Goods are of acceptable quality if they are as:
(a) fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are
commonly supplied; and
(b) acceptable in appearance and finish; and
(c) free from defects; and
(d) safe; and
(e) durable;
as a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the state and condition of the
goods (including any hidden defects of the goods),
would regard as acceptable
having regard to the matters in subsection (3).
(3) The matters for the purposes of subsection (2) are:
(a) the nature of the goods; and
(b) the price of the goods (if relevant); and
(c) any statements made about the goods on any packaging or
label on the goods; and
(d) any representation made about the goods by the supplier or
manufacturer of the goods; and
(e) any other relevant circumstances relating to the supply of
first part of this definition of “acceptable quality” contains a set
of quality elements in s 54(2). The present case
concerns whether the goods are
free from defects and safe: s 54(2)(c) and (d). The second part of the
definition contains a reasonable
consumer test which applies an objective
evaluation of the quality elements, in accordance with the expectations of a
hypothetical
reasonable consumer who is fully acquainted with the state and
condition of the goods, including any hidden defects: s 54(2), taking
account the factors specified in the third part of the definition referred to in
s 54(3), which include any other relevant circumstances
relating to the supply
of the goods: s 54(3)(e).
hypothetical question of whether the reasonable consumer would have regarded the
quality of the goods as acceptable is to be determined
at the time of supply.
However, as Wheelahan J observed in
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v Jayco Corporation Pty Ltd
[2020] FCA 1672
... the reference in s 54(2) to hidden defects has the consequence that for the
purposes of determining that question, the reasonable
consumer may be acquainted
with information known at the time of trial: cf,
Medtel Pty Ltd v
[2003] FCAFC 151
130 FCR 182
(Branson J, Jacobson J
agreeing). The standard of acceptable quality prescribed by s 54(2) is not
absolute, or a standard of perfection.
It is tempered by what a reasonable
consumer would regard as acceptable having regard to the several matters in s
54(3). These matters
render the standard of acceptable quality elastic, and
context specific:
[2009] 2 NZLR 830
(Miller J). The significance of the components of the guarantee of acceptable
quality will therefore vary with the circumstances
of each case.
of the ACL (“Remedies relating to guarantees”) contains Div 1
(“Action against suppliers) and Div 2 (“Action
for damages against
manufacturers of goods”). Subdivision A of Div 1 concerns actions by a
consumer against suppliers of goods
if a consumer guarantee, including under s
54, is not complied with. The remedies available to a consumer depend on whether
the failure
to comply with the guarantee is a major failure or not: s 259(2) and
present case involves Div 2 of
which concerns action by an affected
person against the manufacturer of goods if the consumer guarantee under
s 54 is not complied
271(1) is the remedial provision which entitles consumers to claim damages
against a manufacturer for breach of the consumer
guarantee in s 54:
271 Action for damages against manufacturers of goods
(a) the guarantee under section 54 applies to a supply of goods
to a consumer; and
(b) the guarantee is not complied with;
an affected person in relation to the goods may, by action against the
manufacturer of the goods, recover damages from the manufacturer.
“affected person” who may claim damages under s 272(1) is defined by
as including: (a) a consumer who acquires the goods; (b) a person
who acquires the goods from the consumer (other than for the purpose
resupply); or (c) a person who derives title to the goods through or under the
admitted on the pleadings that it is a manufacturer of the VW Vehicles by
operation of ACL,
which provides that a manufacturer includes “a
person who imports goods into Australia if, (i) the person is not the
manufacturer
of the goods, and (ii) at the time of importation, the manufacturer
of the goods did not have a place of business in Australia”.
entitlement to claim damages is qualified by s 271(2) which provides that s
271(1) does not apply if the consumer guarantee is
not complied with “only
because of” one of three specified circumstances:
(a) an act, default or omission of, or any representation made
by, any person other than the manufacturer or an employee or agent
manufacturer; or
(b) a cause independent of human control that occurred after
the goods left the control of the manufacturer; or
(c) the fact that the price charged by the supplier was higher
than the manufacturer’s recommended retail price, or the average
price, for the goods.
272 specifies the type of the damages recoverable against a manufacturer of
goods for breach of a consumer guarantee:
272 Damages that may be recovered by action against
manufacturers of goods
(1) In an action for damages under this Division, an affected
person in relation to goods is entitled to recover damages for:
(a) any reduction in the value of the goods, resulting from the
failure to comply with the guarantee to which the action relates,
whichever of the following prices is lower:
(i) the price paid or payable by the consumer for the goods;
(ii) the average retail price of the goods at the time of
supply; and
(b) any loss or damage suffered by the affected person because
of the failure to comply with the guarantee to which the action
relates if it
was reasonably foreseeable that the affected person would suffer such loss or
damage as a result of such a failure.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1)(b), the cost of inspecting
and returning the goods to the manufacturer is taken to be a reasonably
foreseeable loss suffered by the affected person as a result of the failure to
comply with the guarantee.
(3) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply to loss or damage suffered
through a reduction in the value of the goods.
Trade Practices Act
to 1 January 2011,
of the TPA (“Consumer Protection”)
included Div 2 (“Conditions and Warranties in Consumer
Transactions”)
and Div 2A (“Actions against Manufacturers and
Importers”). Division 2A contained s 74D which conferred on consumers
direct right of action against a corporate manufacturer of goods which were not
of merchantable quality:
74D Actions in respect of goods of unmerchantable
(a) a corporation, in trade or commerce, supplies goods
manufactured by the corporation to another person who acquires the goods
(b) a person (whether or not the person who acquired the goods
from the corporation) supplies the goods (otherwise than by way
auction) to a consumer;
(c) the goods are not of merchantable quality; and
(d) the consumer or a person who acquires the goods from, or
derives title to the goods through or under, the consumer suffers
loss or damage
by reason that the goods are not of merchantable quality;
the corporation is liable to compensate the consumer or that other person for
the loss or damage and the consumer or that other person
may recover the amount
of the compensation by action against the corporation in a court of competent
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply:
(a) if the goods are not of merchantable quality by reason of:
(i) an act or default of any person (not being the corporation
or a servant or agent of the corporation)
(ii) a cause independent of human control;
occurring after the goods have left the control of the corporation;
(b) as regards defects specifically drawn to the
consumer’s attention before the making of the contract for the supply of
the goods to the consumer; or
(c) if the consumer examines the goods before that contract is
made, as regards defects that the examination ought to reveal.
(3) Goods of any kind are of merchantable quality within the
meaning of this section if they are as fit for the purpose or purposes
goods of that kind are commonly bought as it is reasonable to expect having
(a) any description applied to the goods by the
corporation;
(b) the price received by the corporation for the goods (if
relevant); and
(c) all the other relevant circumstances.
will be apparent from s 74D(2), the entitlement to claim damages under
s 74D(1) is qualified by s 74D(2) which relevantly provides
that s 74D(1)
does not apply if the warranty of merchantable guarantee is not complied with
“by reason of” one of two
specified circumstances, occurring after
the goods have left the control of the corporate manufacturer.
it is not in dispute that at least some of the group members who acquired a VW
Vehicle prior to 1 January 2011 satisfied s
74D(1), being a consumer within the
definition of that term in the TPA, s 4B, who acquired a “good”
being VW Vehicles
and that VW is a deemed “manufacturer” by reason
of the operation of the extended definition of “manufacturer”
TPA, s 74A(4) which was in similar terms to the definition of manufacturer in
see [42] above.
The common questions
questions for determination at the trial were all those arising on the
appellant’s claims and the questions common to the
appellant’s and
group members’ claims as identified in Annexure A to consent orders made
by Sackar J on 21 June 2019
(following a judgment delivered by Sackar
J on 11 December 2018:
Takata Airbags Class Action – Common
[2018] NSWSC 1868)
, together with an additional common question,
Q20A, identified in the consent orders made by Sackar J on 22 May 2020.
is not necessary to reproduce in full the common questions. To the extent that
the appellant challenges the answers to some of
the questions, those questions
and answers given by his Honour are set out in the Schedule to these reasons.
Standard of appellate review
appeal to this Court is an appeal by way of rehearing under
Supreme Court Act 1970
(NSW). Before this Court can interfere with the
findings made by the primary judge, error must be established:
Scenic Tours
Pty Ltd v Moore
[2018] NSWCA 238
(2018) 361 ALR 456
Scenic Tours
at [255], citing
Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v SZVFW
(2018) 264 CLR 541
[2018] HCA 30
(Gageler J).
party directed submissions to the standard of appellate review which applies to
the challenge to the finding that there was
no breach of the guarantee of
acceptable quality in ACL,
Although the determination of this question
involved the exercise of an (objective) evaluative judgment, the test for
establishing
error with respect to whether the appellant’s vehicle was of
acceptable quality is the general “correctness” standard
Warren v Coombes
(1979) 142 CLR 531
[1979] HCA 9
, rather than the
“deferential standard” which tolerates a range of outcomes.
is because the question of whether the appellant’s vehicle was of
acceptable quality must be answered in accordance with
the expectations of a
hypothetical reasonable consumer applying the express statutory criterion in
and (3), and calls for a decision where there is one correct
answer, or adopting the language of Gageler J in
“unique outcome”; see also
Scenic Tours
[2022] NSWCA 132
, [114]-[117] and [189].
whilst due respect is to be paid to the conclusions reached by the primary
judge, this Court must make its own judgment as
to the proper inferences to be
drawn from the established facts and give effect to its own conclusions if they
differ from those
of the primary judge:
Scenic Tours
at [254], citing
at [18] (Kiefel CJ), [27], [48]-[50] (Gageler J). Although his
Honour heard evidence from the appellant, neither party submitted
appellant’s evidence informed his Honour’ evaluative judgment in a
manner that justifies this Court in giving
his Honour’s assessment a
significant degree of respect for that reason:
Scenic Tours
at [33] (Gageler J).
LIABILITY: WHETHER
BREACH OF GUARANTEE OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY
trial, the appellant’s case on liability was that the VW Vehicles
necessarily carried a risk of airbag mis-deployment or
rupture through PSAN
degradation in the presence of moisture and temperature changes. The appellant
characterised the risk as “unquantified
and unquantifiable”. His
case was that:
... it is irrelevant whether the airbags installed in the plaintiff’s car,
or the car of any particular group member, in fact
showed degradation to have
occurred to any level or at all. It is sufficient that the propellant used in
the Takata airbags had a
risk of degradation not present in alternatives.
appellant sought to prove his case on liability by reference to the empirical
analysis program conducted by VW AG and expert evidence
from Mr Renz. It is of
assistance first to refer to this evidence and his Honour’s findings
before summarising the findings
on acceptable quality.
technical and expert evidence on liability issues
Schade was a technical expert employed by the Product Analysis Department within
the Technical Development Department of VW AG.
He had been involved in the
design and implementation of the empirical analysis program and the analysis of
its results since its
inception in February 2016.
indicated, some 20,000 airbag inflators were collected from the field from
Volkswagen vehicles manufactured from 2005 onwards and
from various climatic
zones around the world. As of 2020, the airbags retrieved from the field
represented vehicles of up to 15 years
in age. The airbag inflators were
subjected to several tests: (i) physical examination of the inflated module;
(ii) investigation
of the chemical and physical properties of the propellant;
(iii) computerisation tomography scans (CT scans); (iv) deployment tests
tank tests; and (v) closed vessel analysis of pressure/time curves. Mr Schade
gave evidence that there were approximately 7,000
deployment tests, 5,000 tank
tests (in fact 5,423) and 7,000 closed vessel tests (in fact 7,492).
expert evidence was given as to the risk of mis-deployment or rupture of the
airbags in the VW Vehicles. Mr Renz was called
for the appellant; he was a
chemist with mechanical engineering technology expertise and much experience
working on automatic airbag
ignitors, inflators and micro gas generators.
Prof Thomas Klapötke was called by VW; he was a Professor of Chemistry
Maximilian University in Munich, Germany.
the evidence of the real-world experience of airbags in Volkswagen vehicles, his
Honour made the following general findings:
inflators using
PSAN had been installed in 20 million Volkswagen vehicles worldwide: at [47];
some 440,000 of
those vehicles had been involved in a collision that had resulted in the
deployment of an airbag: at [48];
although many of
those vehicles were relatively new, 50,000 of them were nine years or older, and
therefore of an age where any problem
with the airbags would likely materialise:
there was no
evidence of any mis-deployment of a Takata airbag in any Volkswagen. This fact,
while not determinative, raised a serious
question as to whether there is any
link between PSAN’s propensity to degrade as a matter of generality, and
the likelihood
of any functionally significant propensity of PSAN degradation in
the airbags fitted to Volkswagen vehicles, including the appellant’s
vehicle: at [52];
the geographical
and age spread of the inflators used in the empirical analysis program was
important because PSAN degradation observed
in other brands of vehicles and in
other airbags (such as passenger side frontal airbags) was thought to be more
likely to occur
in hot and humid conditions and in aging vehicles: at [69];
Mr Renz agreed
that the empirical analysis program had involved ample testing across different
climate zones and of inflators of different
ages: at [70];
VW AG concluded
from the empirical analysis program that SDI inflators installed in Volkswagen
vehicles “did not show any functionally
relevant anomalies and no material
manufacturing faults ... that would lead to rupture”: at [72];
the empirical
analysis program revealed that airbag inflators for Volkswagens were different
from the inflators in other vehicles
in ways that might meaningfully affect
their performance: at [74];
product safety committee determined that there was no systemic safety risk
associated with Takata SDI airbag inflators
installed in Volkswagen Vehicles
that would warrant their recall: at [75];
the analysis was
the only empirical evidence before the Court concerning how the airbags are or
were likely to perform: at [76]; and
whilst VW did
not have to show that the airbags are safe, rather it was for the appellant to
show that the airbags are unsafe, the
results of the empirical analysis program
suggest that the airbags are safe: at [77].
to the specific testing as part of the empirical testing program, the evidence
and his Honour’s findings may be summarised
as follows.
Physical examinations and CT scans
Schade gave evidence that the physical examinations of the retrieved airbags
involved visual examination to identify signs of changes
in inflator behaviour
and internal examination by deconstructing the inflator into constituent parts.
The CT scans involved a non-invasive
examination of the inflator and used
two-dimensional, cross-sectional images, which can be combined to produce a
three-dimensional
image of the inflator.
Honour found that the physical examinations and the CT scans showed differences
between airbag inflators fitted to Volkswagen
vehicles and those fitted to other
vehicles: at [80]. As his Honour said (at [81]):
Such differences included:
(a) the number of outflow openings;
(b) the size of the propellant tablets;
(c) the use of a ceramic, rather than a wired, propellant
(d) the use of a thicker base plate;
(e) a design to deploy with larger output pressure;
(f) absence of what Mr Schade described as
“anomalies” in the base of the generators that in other brands
excessive moisture over time; and
(g) use of 60 gm filter compared to a 70 gm filter in SDI
inflators installed in other vehicles.
noting at [82] that Mr Schade gave unchallenged evidence that as a result of
this testing, the airbag inflators fitted to the
Volkswagen Vehicles did not
show any functionally relevant anomalies and no material manufacturing faults
that would lead to rupture,
his Honour found at [83] that this provided support
for the submission made on behalf of VW that airbag inflators for Volkswagen
vehicles are different from the inflators in other vehicles in ways that
meaningfully affect their performance.
Closed vessel
Schade explained that the “closed vessel” testing involved the
removal of the PSAN propellant from retrieved inflators,
a sample of which was
then placed in a reinforced closed vessel and ignited. The burn rate of the
propellant and the pressure generated
by the burning of the propellant (which
produces the gas which inflates the airbag cushion) was calculated. The closed
vessel allowed
the measurement of much higher pressures generated by the
propellant, once ignited, than pressures which are reached within an inflator
during a typical deployment of an airbag. The burn rate of the propellant is
derived from the pressure over time curves that are
produced in the closed
vessel test. The derived burn rate is then compared to the normal burn rate and
a predetermined “critical”
integrated burn rate which is the burn
rate that produces the maximum pressure that the inflator housing is designed to
If the derived burn rate indicated exceeds the desired inflator
housing pressure, then inflator rupture can occur. A burn rate that
produces the
pressure at levels at which the housing can rupture is known as the
“critical burn rate”.
of 1 April 2021, there were 7,493 closed vessel tests. The results of the closed
vessel testing were shown in Figure 21 to Mr Schade’s
affidavit, which was
reproduced as an attachment to the principal judgment. Mr Schade gave evidence
that the closed vessel analysis
confirmed that the inflators from Volkswagen
vehicles did not reveal any critical anomalies in the burn rate of the inflator.
explained that: (i) the normal or expected integrated burn rate for PSAN was
between 1,700 to 1,800 MPa*mm/s, (ii) the pressure/time
curves plotted in pink
and purple in Figure 21 indicated that certain older SDI field inflators
retrieved from Volkswagen vehicles
from hot and humid climates (Zone 1 and 2)
exhibited slightly elevated burn rates, (iii) the highest recorded integrated
for the SDI inflators returned from Volkswagen vehicles was measured
by the closed vessel test to be 2051 MPa*mms, and (iv) the pressure/time
results demonstrate that the SDI inflators installed in the Volkswagen vehicles
exhibited integrated burn rates in the non-critical
Honour observed that the closed vessel testing involved subjecting the PSAN in
the airbag inflators retrieved from the field to
pressure in a reinforced closed
vessel in order to determine whether its integrated burn rate or IBR measured in
megapascals per
millimetre per second, exceeded a “normal” or
“expected” rate of between 1,700 and 1,850 MPa*mm/s or a critical
rupture rate determined by Takata to be 3,000 MPa*mm/s: at [84], [91], [97]. His
Honour found that the evidence established that
the airbags are designed with an
industry standard 150 per cent safety margin above the normal or expected burn
rate, which would
imply a rupture pressure of 2,775 MPa*mm/s: at [103],
[137]-[138]. His Honour noted that the two measures were broadly consistent
one another: at [138]. The evidence was that the highest test result observed
was 2,051 MPa*mm/s: at [94]. His Honour accepted
that this was well below
the critical rupture rate, whether that figure was approximately
2,775 MPa*mm/s as suggested by Mr Renz,
or 3,000 MPa*mm/s calculated by
Takata: at [102], [103], [140].
further findings in relation to the closed vessel tests should be noted: (i) the
results as recorded in Mr Schade’s Figure
21 showed the PSAN was subjected
to pressures up to 90 MPa, being much higher than would normally be experienced
in the field as
the airbags are designed so that when pressure reaches 40 to 50
MPa vent holes open and the airbag inflates: at [90], and (ii) Prof
Klapötke agreed that the experiments conducted by Volkswagen show a
progressive deterioration in the PSAN that exceeds the normal
or expected
parameters set by Volkswagen by about 8 per cent, for the older inflators, not
for the new ones, and agreed that said
that this was “statistically
relevant, though it’s not dangerous”: at [93].
“tank” tests involved the inflator as a unit being placed in a
sealed tank and sensors measured the internal and external
pressure during the
firing of gas generators: at [104]. Mr Schade gave evidence that the burn rate
of the propellant is inferred
from the tank pressure observed during the tank
test. High tank pressure indicates excessively rapid burn-off behaviour.
Klapötke gave evidence that tank pressure and inflator chamber pressure
provide additional information on the propellant
burning behaviour inside the
inflator because it measures the pressure which occurs inside the inflator
housing and in the tank upon
deployment of the inflator being tested. He said
that, as a result, the performance of the propellant as it burns within the
is measured, as opposed to the burn rate of the propellant alone, as is
measured in closed vessel testing.
of 1 April 2021, 5,423 inflators were subjected to the tank tests. There was a
single incident of rupture of an airbag inflator
in a tank test. Mr Renz
accepted in cross-examination that the single incident was an anomaly as
compared to the rest of the data.
Mr Schade described this incident as an
“outlier”. He said that “it was not something that our data
showed at the
time in 2019, or its shows today”, “it is so far out
that it is an outlier by the data”, that the assumed burn
rate for this
test was well above 3,000 (MPa*mm/s) and, “we see that all the other burn
rates that we have are far away from
that”. He proffered the view that
“this one outlier can be due to manufacturing issues at the time of its
production”.
observing that little attention was paid to the tank tests in final submissions,
save that it was emphasised on behalf of the
appellant that during one of these
tests, one inflator ruptured (at [105]), his Honour made the following findings:
only one rupture
occurred in the entire empirical analysis program which involved some 20,000
airbags: at [106]; and
Mr Renz accepted
that the single incident in the tank tests as an anomaly as compared with the
rest of the data: at [107].
The appellant challenges what
it says is his Honour’s implicit finding as to the anomalous nature of
that one rupture in the
tank tests.
The expert evidence concerning the use of PSAN as an inflator in the
their joint report, Mr Renz and Prof Klapötke agreed that the empirical
testing conducted by VW AG was done using sound scientific
and acceptable
practices. They also agreed that the empirical testing shows an increase in the
integrated burn rate or IBR, as the
inflators age, with Prof Klapötke
qualifying his agreement as follows:
I agree that 10-15 year old inflators (VW, SDI) show an increase burn rate,
which is, however, critical still well below the level
at which may give any
cause for concern, as stated in report par 111. If the normal IBR for an SDI
inflator ranges from 1700 to 1850
MPa mm/s and some older inflators show IBR of
1850-2000 MPs mm/s, this is still well below the 3000 MPa mm/s threshold that
has given as being critical.
noting at [120] that PSAN absorbs moisture from the air, his Honour made the
following findings with respect to PSAN’s
propensity to degrade:
Mr Renz and
Prof Klapötke agreed that generally speaking:
(a) the root cause of the degradation of PSAN in the Takata
airbag inflators was thermal fluctuation with moisture being present;
(b) the rate of such degradation increases as the moisture
level increases; and
(c) the degradation of the PSAN will lead to an increase in
surface area of the PSAN which leads to faster burning of the propellant
tablets. This then causes increased pressure inside the inflator, which in turn
causes the airbag inflation to occur faster and at
a higher peak pressure than
would otherwise be the case: at [121];
the experts
diverged as to whether such degradation was progressive, irreversible and
inevitable, being the opinion of Mr Renz, or
whether the position was more
nuanced, being the opinion of Prof Klapötke, which his Honour accepted,
finding that PSAN
exposed to moisture and
temperature fluctuations: at [124];
the rate at
which the PSAN within an airbag inflator will degrade varies significantly
according to a variety of factors which differ
from manufacturer to
manufacturer, and it is not possible to make generalisations between airbags
fitted to different manufacturers’
vehicles or even between different
models of vehicles made by the same manufacturer: at [126];
Mr Renz and Prof
Klapötke agreed that the differences between inflator design and vehicles,
as well as other variables, impacted
upon the level of moisture ingress into an
inflator, being the critical factor associated with degradation of PSAN: at
Mr Renz gave
evidence in cross-examination that “it’s not scientifically valid to
assess PSAN degradation independently
of the particular type of inflator and the
particular vehicle model into which it’s installed” (at [130]), and
that the enquiry as to the safety of the airbag inflators in question
must be vehicle and airbag inflator type specific: at [131];
Klapötke gave evidence in cross-examination that the timing and speed over
which degradation of PSAN will occur is “unknowable
on the basis of
theoretic model of prediction”, however “fierce testing” on
many examples returned from the field
can create a model to be in a position to
predict the time when it becomes critical or dangerous: at [134];
VW had engaged
in “fierce testing” of “many examples returned from the
field” so as to be “in a position
to predict the time when the
airbags become critically dangerous”: at [135]; and
the testing by
VW AG “strongly” suggests that there is no reason to predict that
the airbag inflators actually installed
in Volkswagen vehicles will become
critical or dangerous: at [136].
The primary judge’s
reasons on acceptable quality
is no dispute as to his Honour’s concise statement of the concept of
“acceptable quality” in
It is convenient to reproduce the
reasons at [21]-[24] in full (citations omitted):
The question as to whether goods are of acceptable quality is an objective one,
to be determined on the basis of relevant information
known at the time of the
The test posed by
is not absolute, nor is it a standard of perfection.
Rather, it is a test of what a reasonable consumer would regard as acceptable
having regard to, relevantly here, any relevant circumstances relating to supply
of the goods.
The relevant expectation is that of a reasonable consumer in the position of the
actual consumer. The question is to be answered
on the basis of what was
objectively reasonable to expect at the time of supply.
The answer will always depend on the circumstances.
Honour found that the results of the empirical analysis program could not lead
to a conclusion that the tested airbags were unsafe:
at [110]. On the contrary,
he found that the results suggested that the airbag inflators installed in the
VW vehicles were safe and
that increased integrated burn rates revealed by the
tests were unlikely to translate to aggressive or unsafe deployment of the
is not necessary to summarise all of his Honour’s detailed findings at
[137]-[146] on the propensity or risk of explosion
case, as much of these
reasons have already been referred to at [66] above. It is sufficient to refer
to the following further findings:
the appellant
had failed to show any connection between possible degradation in the PSAN (in
the presence of moisture and temperature
fluctuations) and airbag performance in
VW Vehicles: at [141]-[142];
the appellant
had not established that, on the balance of probabilities, "the alleged
propensity or risk has been present in any Volkswagen
vehicle" or that "the
alleged propensity or risk would have materialised in any Volkswagen [vehicle]
at any identifiable point in
time": at [143];
rather, the most
the appellant can say relying on the evidence of Mr Renz, is that there was
no more than a
theoretical possibility
that at some
[un]identified
in the future, if a vehicle was left in the right environment for long
enough, the alleged propensity or risk might develop at some
future time: at
[144]. (There is an obvious typographical error in the word
“identified” at [144], given Mr Renz’s
evidence referred to at
[100] below.);
the appellant
has not sought to demonstrate that this risk could eventuate within any
meaningful timeframe: at [145], and
the risk that
the appellant asserts remains no more than a speculative possibility: at
is not necessary to refer to the detailed findings at [147]-[151] in relation to
the appellant’s “risk of mis-deployment”
case, since the
appellant did not press this case on appeal. His Honour summarised conclusion on
the “risk of mis-deployment”
case at [152]-[153]:
In substance, the plaintiff’s case is that there is a theoretical
possibility that at some unidentified time in the future
there may be a risk of
misdeployment in an airbag inflator fitted to a Volkswagen vehicle.
I am not satisfied that there is any evidence that any such possibility was real
or would develop in a way that was meaningful to
a consumer.
Finding on acceptable quality
appellant’s case on acceptable quality was that the state and condition of
the goods must be assessed in light of six facts,
which his Honour set out at
a. The PSAN propellent used in the affected airbags has a
propensity to degrade over time given the presence of moisture and changes
temperature;
b. Volkswagen’s own testing shows that propensity is
manifesting in the field. That indicates, that by whatever means, sufficient
moisture is entering the system in the real word to cause measurable degradation
of the PSAN;
c. As PSAN degrades, the risk of the airbag mis-deploying (ie
deploying too quickly) or rupturing increases. This process is inevitable
progressive;
d. If the airbag deploys too quickly, the risk is that it will
not protect the occupant in an accident either at all or to the
extent designed,
leading to an increased risk of injury. If the airbag ruptures, the risk is that
metal fragments are sprayed inside
the cabin and cause injury or death;
e. That process of degradation, culminating in the risk of
misdeployment and rupture, is inevitable in the sense that given temperature
fluctuations and moisture,
those outcomes will happen at some stage
f. No time frame can be given for when the risk of
misdeployment and/or rupture arises for any given car and the risk for any given
car at any given point in time cannot be quantified, other than to say that the
risk increases over time. (Emphasis added in original.)
Honour concluded at [159] that he was not persuaded that the appellant’s
vehicle was not of acceptable quality, nor persuaded
that VW had failed to
comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality in
He summarised his
reasons at [156]-[158]:
But, for the reasons I have set out, a reasonable consumer in this hypothetical
circumstance would also be acquainted with the fact
that there was no reason to
think that, probably, “those outcomes will happen at some stage”
[see [155e] set out above]
in any Volkswagen and thus in the plaintiff’s
This reflects the link or integer that is missing from the plaintiff’s
case, namely between the propensity of PSAN to degrade
and any relevant,
functionally significant propensity of PSAN to degrade in Volkswagens.
Further, the reasonable consumer in the hypothetical circumstance posed by
would also be acquainted with the fact that motor vehicles are
complicated pieces of machinery that may develop problems, even problems
to the safety of the vehicle, that may require rectification by the manufacturer
during the vehicle’s lifetime.
Grounds 1-10
1-10 contend:
1. The primary judge erred in failing to hold that the
appellant's vehicle was not of acceptable quality at the time of supply
appellant within the meaning of
of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL).
2. The primary judge ought to have found that the appellant's
vehicle was not of acceptable quality under
of the ACL by reason of the
matters recorded at J[155] together with the following facts, which were
established on the evidence
and ought to have been found:
(a) A substantial portion (circa 30%) of Volkswagen vehicles
still remain on the road after 15 years;
(b) The oldest of the inflators the subject of the closed
vessel and tank tests carried out by the respondent as part of its Empircal
[sic] Testing Program was 12 years;
(c) The results of the burn closed vessel tests showed that the
incidence of integrated burn rates for phase stabilised ammonium
nitrate (PSAN)
propellent retrieved from used vehicles exceeding the baseline integrated burn
rates for new PSAN increased with the
age of the vehicle; and
(d) Alternative propellants existed and were in use at all
material times which did not have a propensity to degrade over time
presence of moisture and temperature changes.
3. To the extent that the primary judge did not make findings
in terms of the matters at J[155], his Honour ought to have made
such findings
and erred in not doing so.
4. The primary judge erred in holding that:
(a) in addition to the matters at J[155], the reasonable
consumer in the hypothetical circumstance posed by
of the ACL would also be
acquainted with the fact that there was no reason to think that, probably,
misdeployment or explosion will
happen at some stage in any Volkswagen or in the
appellant's vehicle;
(b) if such knowledge was to be imputed to the reasonable
consumer, it produced the result that the affected vehicles were of acceptable
5. The primary judge erred in finding that the results of
Volkswagen's Empirical Analysis Program:
(a) suggest that the airbags are safe;
(b) suggest that there is no reason to predict that the airbag
inflators actually installed in Volkswagen vehicles will become
critical or
(c) could not lead to a conclusion that the airbags were
6. The primary judge erred in failing to hold that the defect
lay in the vulnerability of the PSAN propellent to ordinary real
conditions under which moisture could be present in, or enter, the inflation
unit, including humidity at the manufacturing
plant, error in affixing seals,
baseline permeability or leakage of seals, and ordinary wear and tear.
7. The primary judge erred in disregarding the single instance
of rupture in the tank tests carried out by Volkswagen. His Honour
ought to have
found that it demonstrated that the vulnerability at ground [6] above could lead
to rupture of the airbag inflator
and the risk of explosion or misdeployment.
8. The primary judge erred in holding that it was necessary for
the appellant to establish that the risk of misdeployment or rupture
from the accepted propensity of PSAN to degrade over time in the presence of
temperature cycling and moisture would have
materialised in any Volkswagen
vehicle at any identifiable point in time.
9. The primary judge erred in taking into account, or
considering it relevant to the analysis under
of the ACL, that motor
vehicles are complicated pieces of machinery that may develop problems, even
problems going to the safety
of the vehicle, that may require rectification by
the manufacturer.
10. The primary judge erred in answering in the negative each
of common questions 3, 4, 10 and 11. The primary judge ought to have
each of these questions, yes.
1-4, 6 and 8 contend in various ways that his Honour ought to have found that
the appellant’s vehicle was not of acceptable
quality. It is common ground
that the outcome of the challenge to the finding on acceptable quality governs
the question of merchantable
quality. Ground 5 challenges the findings in
relation to the significance of the empirical testing program. Ground 7
challenges the
specific finding in relation to the single instance of rupture of
the airbag inflator in the tank tests. Ground 9 challenges the
concerning the nature of motor vehicles. Ground 10 challenges the answers to
some common questions and depends on the outcome
of the other grounds.
indicated, the references in grounds 4, 7 and 8 to the appellant’s case
based on the risk of mis-deployment can be ignored,
as this case was not pressed
The appellant’s argument on appeal
appellant’s submissions addressed grounds 1-10 compendiously under three
headings: Volkswagen’s testing, Expert evidence,
and Unacceptable quality.
Not all the grounds were the subject of submissions. It is said that sub-pars
(e) and (f) of [155] of the
principal judgment (set out at [78]
encapsulates the way the appellant puts his case on appeal.
is convenient to address the grounds as advanced in the appellant’s
submissions in the following order: (1) the closed vessel
testing, (2) the
single tank test result, (3) the empirical testing program, (4) the nature of
motor vehicles, and (5) whether the
VW Vehicles were of unacceptable
The closed vessel testing
is common ground that the closed vessel test involves observing the PSAN burning
in conditions that do not exist when an airbag
is ignited in the field. Airbag
inflators are designed so that once the propellant is ignited and starts
generating gas, the pressure
within the inflator will start to stabilise once it
reaches a certain point, approximately 45-50 MPa, as gas is released from the
vent openings. By contrast, in a closed vessel test the propellant continues to
burn to conditions where the pressure significantly
exceeds 50 MPa. The closed
vessel tests subjected the PSAN in the inflators to pressures of up to
90 MPa, which his Honour found
was much higher than would normally be
experienced in the field as airbags are designed so that when pressure reaches
40-50 MPa vent
holes open and the airbag inflates: at [90].
8 per cent of the closed vessel test results exceeded the “normal”
or “expected” range of the integrated
burn rate. The appellant
referred to the “normal” or “expected” range as the
“accepted” range
as determined by Takata and adopted by Volkswagen.
VW submits that it does not follow that a test result above this level was
unacceptable
or to be deemed dangerous. It said that the relevant comparator was
the critical rupture rate, which as his Honour observed at [100],
was the rate
at which there was the possibility of rupture of an airbag on inflation.
appellant made two related complaints in relation to his Honour’s findings
in relation to the closed vessel testing. The
first is that although his Honour
recognised that the testing showed that the integrated burn rate of PSAN from
retrieved airbag
inflators exceeded Takata’s “normal” or
“expected” range of between 1,700 and 1,850 MPa*mm/s in 8 per
of results, his Honour focused on the fact that all the results were
substantially below the “critical rupture point”
of 3,000 MPa*mm/s
as determined by Takata: at [100]-[103]. The second is that his Honour focused
on the margin between the highest
observed closed vessel test result of 2,051
MPa*mm/s and either the 3,000 MPa*mm/s critical rate calculated by Takata, or
MPa*mm/s rate implied by applying a 150 per cent safety margin to the
expected range: at [138]-[139].
is said that (i) the true significance of the closed vessel testing was that it
showed that the PSAN in the airbag inflators fitted
to the VW Vehicles had the
propensity to degrade in the presence of moisture and temperature change, and
(ii) the closed vessel testing
showed that degradation of PSAN, which is a
progressive and irreversible process, was occurring in Volkswagen vehicles.
support of these submissions, the appellant selectively quoted from the evidence
of Prof Klapötke who accepted that the 8
per cent result was statistically
significant and showed a progressive deterioration in the PSAN. This omitted
reference to Prof
Klapötke’s full answer, that although 8 per cent is
statistically relevant, “it’s not dangerous”, as
recorded in the passage of cross-examination extracted at [93].
appellant also selectively quoted from the evidence of Mr Schade. It is said
that he accepted that the closed vessel test results
showed “that our
propellant does degrade. It changes compared to what it was when it was
produced”. This omitted reference
to Mr Schade’s full answer,
“[i]t has a slight change”, and his explanation in relation to
Figure 21 concerning
the closed vessel test results that the pressure rate of
45 MPa to 50 MPa is the “designed pressure” in the field (or
any tank test), so that the “important” results are the IBR to the
“left of 45 [MPa]” in Figure 21.
was no evidence that an integrated burn rate in excess of the
“normal” or “expected” range indicates
an adverse impact
on function. At trial, the appellant accepted that the observed integrated burn
rate for the closed vessel tests
at pressure levels of 45 or 50 MPa:
... doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ve proved a real or appreciable
risk. Because I can’t prove at what level the
real or appreciable risk
comes in, unless you pick the 3,000. And I’m talking about deployment less
short of rupture, ....
I can’t prove that.
The reference to 3,000 was a reference to the critical rupture rate as
determined by Takata of 3,000 MPa*mm/s.
appellant’s submissions ignore the critical point which his Honour
recognised at [101], when addressing the implications
of the integrated burn
rates being above Takata’s normal or expected range: none of the closed
vessel tests approached the
critical rupture rate or established an adverse
impact on the function of the airbag. As his Honour found, the results of the
vessel testing did not show that any degradation in PSAN would occur to
such an extent or within such a timeframe as to affect the
performance of the
airbag inflators in a manner that had practical consequences for the
vehicles’ owners: at [140], [142],
is a further point. Mr Schade explained that the IBR is calculated using the
data about the rate at which the propellant burned
when the pressure within the
closed vessel was between 10 MPa and 65 MPa. He said that the increased pressure
in the closed vessel
has an impact on the burn rate of the propellant, and the
burn rate will accelerate even more as the pressure increases beyond 50
This evidence was unchallenged. VW submits that given the nature of closed
vessel testing, the observed burn rate in the closed
vessel testing at pressure
levels above 50 MPa is higher than that which would be generated if the same
PSAN was ignited in real
world conditions. The appellant said that “whilst
the actual pressure at any point in time in an inflator in the real world
be lower than the integrated burn rate
, that fact does not support a
contention that there is a greater gap between actual pressure and rupture point
than that suggested
by comparison of the integrated burn rates” (emphasis
appellant misstates and misunderstands VW’s submission. The point is not
one of comparison of the actual pressure in an
inflator in the real world and
the integrated burn rate, rather, the point is that the actual pressure in the
closed vessel tests
above 50 MPa is higher than would be experienced in the real
world and this has an effect on the observed burn rates above 50 MPa*mm/s.
Mr Schade’s unchallenged evidence that the burn rate will accelerate even
more as the pressure in the closed vessel increases
beyond 50 MPa, VW is correct
to submit that even the highest observed integrated burn rate of
2,051 MPa*mm/s is not proof the if
PSAN in an airbag of equivalent age and
conditions were ignited in the real world, it would reach that burn rate. The
burn rate would
in fact be lower than the rate observed in the closed vessel
is said that two circumstances demonstrate error in his Honour’s finding
that the closed vessel tests did not suggest that
the critical rupture rate was
reached. Each is considered below.
Whether the closed vessel
tests captured vehicles up to 12 years old or 15 years old
first matter is Takata’s investigations unrelated to Volkswagen vehicles
which suggested that the minimum field exposure
for problems with the airbags
was seven years and the majority of field ruptures occurred after ten years or
more. It is said that
Volkswagen's closed vessel testing was only capturing the
early part of the likely period of heightened risk because this testing
vehicles that were between 5 and 12 years old. This submission was based on
Figure 23 in Mr Schade’s affidavit but
ignored that the summaries and
tables in Mr Schade’s affidavit are effectively points in time.
Mr Schade explained, the testing was ongoing and the database maintained by
VW AG was constantly being updated (monthly as of January
2021) as more tests
were conducted. The evidence at trial captured all relevant tests, including
closed vessel tests, as of 1 April
2021; this is evident from the content of the
electronic spreadsheets that were provided by VW’s solicitors to the
appellant’s
solicitors on 7 April 2021. Documents extracted from those
electronic spreadsheets made good VW’s submission that the closed
tests included vehicles manufactured in 2006.
can the results obtained by Takata for other manufacturers’ vehicles be
translated to Volkswagen vehicles. The evidence
was that there had been no such
rupture in a Volkswagen vehicle anywhere in the world. As his Honour noted at
[51], 50,000 of the
440,000 Volkswagen vehicles involved in accidents were nine
years or older, and thus of an age where any problem with the airbags
likely materialise. Further, there is an unchallenged finding at [74] that the
airbag inflators for Volkswagen vehicles were
different from the inflators in
other vehicles in ways that might meaningfully affect their performance.
One third of Volkswagen vehicles still on the road at 15
second matter is that some one third of Volkswagen vehicles in Australia were
still on the road at 15 years. It is said that the
VW AG testing does not
establish what happens after that. But this ignores several important matters.
the appellant had the onus of proof that the airbags in the VW Vehicles were
unsafe. Mr Renz accepted that he could not say
that degradation of PSAN
would reach a point of functional significance at
identifiable point
in time, let alone within the service life of any of the VW Vehicles. When asked
vessel test results which exceeded the
“expected” integrated burn rate and the highest test result of 2,051
which exceeded the “expected” integrated burn rate by about
either 11 per cent, or 15 per cent on Mr Renz’s implied
Mr Renz agreed that he did not have any data to indicate that that level of
exceedance will affect the process of the airbag
deployment in a way that
impacts on its safe operation.
the closed vessel testing did not disclose unacceptable results, even for
vehicles up to 15 years old. The testing established
that the degree of
degradation of PSAN in the 8 per cent of observed cases did not interfere with
their safe and effective operation.
As his Honour found, none of the results
came anywhere near Takata’s critical rupture point: at [102]. The results
of the testing
were inconsistent with the appellant’s case that PSAN
degradation is inherently dangerous.
nor did the closed vessel testing establish the appellant’s contention
stage in the life of the Volkswagen vehicles, the
degradation would reach the point where rupture would occur” (emphasis
The appellant did not demonstrate that there is degradation to such an
extent as to have an adverse impact on functionality of the
airbags within any
meaningful timeframe. The submission about the situation getting worse at some
time in the future was merely speculation.
is no basis to infer from the results of the closed vessel testing that the
critical rupture point would have been reached within
the lifespan of the
VW Vehicles. As his Honour found at [140], the appellant did not establish
any connection between the possible
degradation in the PSAN and the airbag
performance in Volkswagens.
challenge in grounds 2 and 3 to the findings in relation to the closed vessel
testing should be rejected.
The single tank test result
7 contends that his Honour erred by disregarding the single instance of rupture
of the inflator that occurred in the tank tests
conducted on some 5,000
inflators as part of the empirical testing program. The airbag inflator had been
retrieved from a 2007 Volkswagen
Polo located in Queensland, being XTLU00902851.
to the appellant’s submission, his Honour did not disregard this result.
It was expressly considered at [105]-[107],
together with the evidence given by
Mr Renz, who conceded in the passage of his cross-examination extracted by his
Honour at [107],
that the single result was an anomaly.
is said that the one ruptured inflator during tank testing demonstrates that
there was in fact a breach of the guarantee of acceptable
quality. Being a
destructive test, by the time of trial all that was available was the data. This
was reproduced in Mr Renz’s
report in reply at par [82] in a graph which
is set out below:
Figure 2: Plot of Ruptured Inflator XTLU00902851
his report, Mr Renz attributed significance to the initial rise in pressure in
the airbag inflator over the first two milliseconds,
followed by a brief pause
and then approximately 10 millisecond exponential rise in internal pressure,
before bursting. Mr Renz said
that this reflected the shape of the curve
produced by mapping pressure over time in reports which concerned vehicles other
Volkswagen vehicles: the Orbital-ATK report of September 2016 and the first
report of Exponent Inc of July 2016. Based on the similarities
between the
pattern of pressure seen in relation to the inflator retrieved from the 2007
Polo and his views as to the propensity
of PSAN to degrade, Mr Renz considered
that this rupture was due to the degradation of PSAN-based propellant in the
observations can be made in relation to Figure 2 in the Renz report. The
unlabelled X axis is time in milliseconds. The Y
axis is labelled
“Pressure” but does not give a unit, however, by comparing the graph
in Figure 2 with that in the Orbital-ATK
report, to which Mr Renz referred, the
Y axis seems to be in atmospheres. Normal atmospheric pressure is about 101,325
pascals (Pa)
or 101.325 kilopascals (kPa). By comparing the graph in Figure 6 in
the Orbital-ATK report with the graph in Figure 2 prepared by
Mr Renz, it
would seem that the peak on Mr Renz’s graph at “900”,
would, if it is measured in atmospheres, correspond
to 90,000 kPa, which is
consistent with the peak “runaway pressure” on airbags with degraded
PSAN shown in the Orbital-ATK
specific submission was made at trial based on the graph in Figure 2 of the Renz
report. There is, however, a deal of potential
inaccuracy in Mr Renz’s
graph. It shows that the pressure in the inflator (grey line) increased
dramatically
the pressure in the tank (orange line) increased at
all. This was not explored in the evidence or in submissions. (Given the nature
of the tank test, a possible explanation might be the small delay between the
rise in pressure observed in the inflator after ignition
and the rise in
external pressure observed in the tank, once the vent holes in the inflator
open.) It also shows negative pressure
for the inflator (grey line). The
appellant did not address this matter, despite it being drawn to counsel’s
attention in oral
argument in this Court. It also refers to the “Inflator
pressure” (grey line) as “Mpa”, presumably, megapascals,
the Y axis seems to be in kilopascals.
is said that Mr Renz was not cross-examined on his opinion in his report in
reply (at par [84]) that this rupture was due to the
degradation of PSAN-based
propellant in the inflator. That misstates the position. Mr Renz was
cross-examined, assuming the PSAN
had degraded, as to what might have caused the
PSAN to have degraded to the point of causing rupture in the particular
He accepted that a production fault affecting that particular inflator
that led to moisture ingress is “possible” but
said that probability
was “not very high”. Upon further cross-examination, Mr Renz
ultimately accepted that the single
instance of rupture in the tank tests was an
“anomaly”. As his Honour noted at [105], little attention was paid
tank tests in final submissions, save for Mr Renz’s acceptance
that the single result was anomalous.
appellant sought to diminish Mr Renz’s answer as being
“ambiguous”. But there was no ambiguity in the proposition
by Mr Renz in cross-examination. Having agreed with the cross-examiner that
there was a “large body of data, including
a large number of airbags from
2007 that have been tested and shown burn rates nowhere near the rupture
level”, Mr Renz accepted
the proposition that “[v]iewed in that
light, this single result you would view as an anomaly as compared to the rest
data”. The evidence did not stop there. Mr Schade gave evidence
that the single instance of rupture in the tank tests was an
outlier is something which is not regarded as probative of the conclusion sought
to be drawn from a statistical analysis because
it is to be inferred that the
data is corrupted or distorted in some way. Although challenged in
cross-examination, Mr Schade maintained
his view that it was correct to exclude
this result because it “doesn’t fit into the data. It is an outlier
statistic”.
There was no error by his Honour in not finding that the
single instance of rupture in the tank test demonstrated that the asserted
vulnerability of the PSAN propellant to degradation could lead to rupture of the
airbag inflator (grounds 6 and 7).
is said that the tank testing disclosed a 1:5,000 chance of failure and that his
Honour’s reference to the entire empirical
analysis program in which some
20,000 airbags were tested reveals a misunderstanding of the evidence. This
misstates his Honour’s
finding at [106]. His Honour did not say that the
testing disclosed a 1:20,000 chance of failure. He merely observed that there
only one such occurrence of failure out of some 20,000 airbags that were
tested in various ways.
is also said that whether the correct ratio is 1:5,000 or 1:20,000, it must be
unacceptable from the standpoint of the reasonable
consumer. That ignores that a
single failure observed in a sample does not
necessarily
probability of failure in the population. As VW correctly submits, to determine
a probability, it would be necessary to
at least generate a statistically
significant number of failures and then consider that number against the total
number of failures.
Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, the single
instance of rupture in the tank tests could not be regarded as probative
conclusion sought to be drawn by the appellant from a statistical analysis.
is said that “the only test in which a rupture could occur was a tank
test”. To the extent that this submission implied
that the tank test was
the only test indicating the likelihood of rupture, that is incorrect. The
closed vessel testing involved
measuring the integrated burn rate for PSAN in
various igniters retrieved from the field and comparing the burn rates to the
rupture pressure. None of some 7,000 tests even approached that
pressure level.
is said that the manufacturing defect explanation suggested by Mr Schade
for the single instance of rupture occurring in the tank
test “proves the
appellant’s case”. According to the submission, unless VW has a
perfect manufacturing process
that eliminates such flaws, the lack of acceptable
quality flows from the inevitable vulnerability to such flaws in a mass-produced
product when compared to alternatives. But no finding was made by his Honour
concerning any manufacturing defect in the single inflator
that ruptured in the
the state of the evidence, that is unsurprising. Mr Schade’s
suggestion of a manufacturing issue was no more than that,
a possibility. Mr
Renz said that the probability of a production fault was not very high. He also
acknowledged that, being a destructive
test, analysis of what caused the PSAN in
this particular inflator to degrade was “impossible”.
as VW submits, even if a different defect at the time of manufacture allowed
moisture to enter the airbag inflator that ruptured,
that does not establish
that all airbags that use PSAN have the alleged propensity or risk of rupture.
The appellant did not suggest,
nor did the evidence establish, that a different
defect was present in all VW Vehicles. Ground 7 should be rejected.
Reliance on the VW AG empirical testing program
5 contends that his Honour erred in finding that the results of the empirical
testing program by VW AG (i) suggest that the
airbags are safe, (ii) suggest
that there is no reason to predict that the airbag inflators installed in the VW
Vehicles would become
critical or dangerous, and (iii) could not lead to a
conclusion that the airbags were unsafe. This ground can be dealt with
briefly, given that the matters relied upon in support of this ground
have been largely addressed above.
is no challenge to his Honour’s finding at [78] that there is nothing in
the evidence to suggest that the empirical analysis
program was not a genuine
attempt by VW AG to ascertain whether there was any problem with Takata airbags
installed in Volkswagens.
is there any challenge to the methodology adopted by VW AG. As his Honour found
at [70], Mr Renz, the appellant’s expert,
agreed that the program involved
ample testing across different climate zones and of inflators of different ages.
is said that the testing was confined to airbags and PSAN retrieved from
vehicles that were no more than 12 years old, and that
the testing could not
predict, nor did it even purport to predict, whether, and if so when, the
airbags will become critically dangerous.
This submission has been addressed
above. As his Honour found at [68], the empirical testing program involved
airbags retrieved from
Volkswagen vehicles from 2005 onwards. Contrary to the
appellant’s submission, the closed vessel tests captured vehicle up
years old: see [96]-[97] above.
balance of the submission ignored the matters referred to at [100]-[103]
above. The fact that the closed vessel tests recorded that, for vehicles up
to 15 years old, the burn rate observed in the closed
vessel testing never
approached the critical rupture rate, was consistent with the real-world
experience. There had been no such
rupture in a Volkswagen vehicle anywhere in
the world and no meaningful degradation had been found in testing on inflators
from Volkswagen
vehicles up to 15 years old.
is not in issue that Prof Klapötke did not attempt to model the risk of
when the PSAN might become unsafe. So much is accepted
by VW. But contrary to
the appellant’s contention that the predictive exercise of when PSAN might
become critical or dangerous
in “unknowable”, his Honour accepted
Prof Klapötke’s evidence that whilst the timing and speed of the
degradation
process with respect to PSAN is “unknowable on the basis of
theoretical model of prediction”, it is possible to model
when the PSAN
might become unsafe: at [134]. As his Honour found at [145], the appellant has
not sought to demonstrate that this
risk could eventuate within any meaningful
is said that his Honour erred in referring to the empirical testing as
“fierce”. This is a misreading of his Honour’s
reasons. His
Honour was simply making the point that the testing conducted on over 20,000
airbags, involving both observations from
the actual tests and the trend
observable across those tests, put VW AG in a position to conclude that there
were no systemic safety
risks in relation to the VW Vehicles. His Honour did not
find that the empirical testing was determinative. Rather, he rejected the
appellant’s submission that the empirical analysis program could lead to a
conclusion that the tested airbags were unsafe:
was no error in finding that the empirical testing suggests, very strongly, that
there is no reason to predict that the airbag
inflators actually installed in
Volkswagen vehicles will become critical or dangerous: at [77], [136]. Ground 5
should be rejected.
The nature of motor vehicles
9 contends that his Honour erred at [158] by considering it relevant to the
analysis of acceptable quality under
“that motor vehicles are
complicated pieces of machinery that may develop problems, even going to the
safety of the vehicle,
that may require rectification by the manufacturer during
the vehicle’s lifetime”.
writing, the appellant acknowledged that his Honour’s observation was
“self-evidently correct”. In oral argument,
the appellant accepted
that the observation does not seem to have impacted his Honour’s decision
on liability. To the extent
that the appellant said that it is not apparent what
his Honour’s observation was intended to suggest, this is immaterial.
that no error has been identified, ground 9 should be
Unacceptable quality
contention that the appellant’s vehicle was not of acceptable quality was
put in two ways. In chief, the appellant said
that his vehicle was not safe and
free from defects as the hypothetical reasonable consumer would regard as
acceptable because his
vehicle was manufactured with a particular physical
feature, PSAN propellant in the airbag inflator, that is responsible for a risk
of rupture (because PSAN is subject to progressive degradation over time in the
presence of temperature changes and moisture), which
in turn translates into
“increased” risk of death or injury.
reply, the appellant said that it is not necessary to establish that the good
has a “relevant quality or characteristic”
that makes the good of
unacceptable quality, rather, the “relevant characteristic” can be
“an unquantifiable risk
of serious harm”, at least where (i) the
risk is not fanciful, (ii) arises from the application of physics and common
in respect of a physical-chemical process which is shown to occur in real
world conditions, and (iii) has not been excluded for the
realistic life of the
good or otherwise dealt with by appropriate disclosure and/or safeguard
different way in which the argument was put in reply reflected the evidentiary
difficulties confronting the argument in chief.
Each argument is addressed
Whether a physical feature of the VW Vehicles was
responsible for a risk of rupture
the first way the unacceptable quality argument is put, the appellant
characterised the PSAN propellant as a latent defect in the
airbag inflators.
appellant does not challenge the finding at [156], insofar as it concerns the
appellant’s vehicle, that the hypothetical
reasonable consumer would "also
be acquainted with the fact that there was no reason to think that probably,
'those outcomes' [(ie
rupture or mis-deployment)] will happen at some stage in
any Volkswagen and thus in the [appellant’s] vehicle". The appellant
accepts that “it cannot be said that it is more probable than not that
rupture ... will happen in respect of [his] vehicle”.
But it is said that
is not an answer because:
Sackville J had inferred on the balance of probabilities that
had Mr Courtney's pacemaker remained
it would not have
ceased to function prematurely by reason of battery depletion:
[16]. At the risk of repetition, the point is that the physical feature of the
vehicle (PSAN propellant) increased the risk of
such outcomes.
Pty Ltd v Courtney
(2003) 130 FCR 182
[2003] FCAFC 151
involved pacemakers
which were found not to be of merchantable quality because of the increased risk
of premature failure. It is
said by analogy with
that Volkswagen's
testing suggested that the conditions required for degradation of PSAN were
occurring in about 8 per cent of Volkswagen
vehicles tested, which is comparable
to the 5.5 per cent of pacemakers in
(which had been returned to
the manufacturer).
suggested analogy with
there was evidence of an inherent risk associated with the
pacemakers supplied to consumers without the particular product purchased
Courtney having actually failed. The pacemakers were shown to be of greater risk
of failing by reason of accelerated battery
depletion than other pacemakers
manufactured by the same manufacturer. The accelerated battery depletion was the
consequence partial
short circuits because the yellow spool solder used in the
manufacturing process tended to give rise to dendritic growth:
[10]-[13]. The dendritic growth had been observed in 5.5 per cent of the
pacemakers which had been returned to the manufacturer:
J (Jacobsen J agreeing) observed at [60] that the trial judge had found at that
the use of yellow spool solder in the manufacturing
process led to a
“superadded risk of premature failure” by reason of partial short
circuit. Her Honour rejected the notion
that it would be absurd to consider
a product unmerchantable where it carried “a slight but appreciable
risk” of toxicity
Honour emphasised that the conclusion by the trial judge that
Mr Courtney’s pacemaker was unmerchantable in breach of the
in TPA, s 74D was not based upon its simply being a member of a class that had a
statistically significant risk of failure
but was, rather, based upon its
exhibiting a particular physical characteristic (the yellow spool solder) that
carried the risk of
premature failure (at [77]). Her Honour continued at
... As a consequence of its method of manufacture it was itself at added risk
because of the white residue, when compared with pacemakers
not so manufactured,
of premature battery depletion caused by dendritic growth. That is, his Honour
concluded that, because it had
been manufactured with yellow spool solder,
Mr Courtney’s pacemaker was not as fit for the purpose for which
pacemakers are
commonly bought as it was reasonable to expect for the reason
that its method of manufacture gave it the quality of carrying a risk
premature failure which was higher than it was objectively reasonable to expect
in a pacemaker.
the risk of premature failure of the battery was not a theoretical
or speculative possibility. By contrast, in this case, there was
no demonstrated
risk of rupture (or mis-deployment) of the airbags in any of the VW Vehicles.
His Honour, relevantly, found that
(i) the appellant failed to establish any
connection between the propensity of PSAN to degrade in the presence of moisture
and temperature
changes and airbag performance in Volkswagens, (ii) the
appellant did not demonstrate that the asserted risk of rupture could eventuate
within any meaningful timeframe, and (iii) the asserted risk was no more than a
speculative possibility: at [142]-[146]. No error
has been shown in these
is said, unlike
Protec Pacific Pty Ltd v Steuler Services GmbH & Co
[2014] VSCA 338
, that the appellant “has established on
the balance of probabilities that there is a risk of rupture ... in Volkswagen
and that a physical feature of the vehicle (the use of PSAN as
propellant) is responsible for that risk”. The submission continued:
It is not to the point that the appellant did not show that an integrated burn
rate sufficient to rupture the airbag ... having a
particular physical
consequence would be generated at identifiable point in time. The very fact that
no identifiable point in time
can be predicted for any given vehicle is part of
what makes the vehicle of unacceptable quality.
does not assist the appellant.

and Kyrou JJA) concluded in

Without having first established that it was a physical feature of HDPE that was
responsible for the risk of premature failure, no
reliance could be
appropriately placed upon the analysis in
Medtel v Courtney
to conclude
that the owner of a solvent extraction plant would not be prepared to run the
risk of using HDPE lining. While it follows
that it is permissible to demonstrate unsuitability on the
basis of an inherent risk associated with a type of product, without the
particular product purchased having actually failed, it is first necessary to
establish that the type of product carries the inherent
risk alleged. In our
opinion, this is what BHP has failed to do.
appellant contends that a possibility of a quality that would render the good
unacceptable, is sufficient to establish a contravention
describe the process of degradation of the PSAN propellant, if exposed to
temperature changes and moisture, as one which is
known to be “progressive
and irreversible”, does not demonstrate that a risk of rupture is present
in the airbags in
the VW Vehicles or the nature of such risk. As indicated,
there was no materialisation of the asserted risk of rupture within the
timeframes tested by VW AG, which included vehicles up to 15 years old. That
accorded with the real-world experience that there had
been no such rupture in a
Volkswagen vehicle anywhere in the world.
to the appellant’s submission, the closed vessel tests and the tank tests
did not establish the “relevant, functionally
significant propensity of
PSAN to degrade in Volkswagens”. His Honour found at [136] that the
testing by VW AG suggests very
strongly that there is no reason to predict that
the airbag inflators installed in the VW Vehicles will become critical or
Further, in the summary of his conclusions at [14], his Honour found
that “the appellant has not established any relevant,
functionally
significant, propensity of the PSAN to degrade in the airbag installed in the
appellant’s vehicle so as to cause
it to explode [ie rupture] ...”.
No error has been shown in these findings.
that it follows from
that it is permissible to demonstrate
unacceptable quality on the basis of an inherent risk associated with a type of
product, without
the risk having actually materialised, it is first necessary to
establish that the type of product carries the inherent risk alleged.
is then necessary to consider the comparison required by
this case, the inherent risk alleged concerns the functional impact of the
airbags on use and safety of the VW Vehicles; it is
said that there is an
increased risk of rupture of the airbags in the VW Vehicles. But the appellant
failed to prove that the airbags
in the VW Vehicles carried the inherent risk
alleged. Mr Renz accepted that he could not say that degradation of PSAN would
a point of functional significance at
identifiable point in
time, let alone within the service life of any of the VW Vehicles: see [100]
above. Nor does it assist the
appellant’s case to describe the alleged
risk as “unquantified and unquantifiable”.
was no error in the finding at [143] that the appellant failed to prove, on the
balance of probabilities, that the alleged propensity
or risk of PSAN to degrade
in the presence of moisture and temperature changes would have materialised in
any Volkswagen vehicle
at any identifiable point in time.
unquantifiable risk of serious harm
argument that a “relevant characteristic” which makes the good of
unacceptable quality can be an “unquantifiable
risk of serious
harm”, proceeds on the basis that:
(1) the appellant did not show that an integrated burn rate sufficient to
rupture the airbag having a particular physical consequence
would be generated
at an identifiable point in time;
(2) the very fact that no identifiable point in time can be predicted for any
given vehicle is part of what makes the vehicle of
unacceptable quality; and
(3) it does not matter that the appellant did not prove if and when the airbag
in his vehicle would rupture or mis-deploy.
to (1) and (2) above, it is not in dispute that PSAN may absorb moisture and
that this may contribute to a process of degradation
which increases the burn
rate for PSAN. At trial, the parties diverged as to whether the appellant had
shown anything more than the
theoretical potential for a form of aggressive
burning of PSAN that can cause rapid inflation of an airbag in such a way as to
a rupture. As indicated, Mr Renz accepted that he could not say that
degradation of PSAN would reach a point of functional significance
identifiable point in time, let alone within the service life of any of the
VW Vehicles.
did the empirical testing conducted by VW AG prove the appellant’s
contention that the degree of moisture absorption that
affected Takata airbags
in Volkswagen vehicles gave rise to the alleged propensity or risk that the
airbags would rupture in a manner
that causes harm to vehicle owners. As his
Honour found at [142], the appellant failed to establish any connection between
degradation in PSAN and airbag performance in Volkswagens. The
contention that the “unquantifiable risk of serious harm”
fanciful should be rejected. As his Honour found at [146], the risk that the
appellant alleged was no more than a speculative
possibility.
to (3) above, the appellant sought to prove that his vehicle was of unacceptable
quality because it was manufactured with a particular
feature (PSAN propellant
in the airbag inflators) that was responsible for an increased risk of rupture
compared with airbags not
manufactured using PSAN. For the reasons given above,
the appellant failed to do so.
is said that the unquantifiable risk makes the appellant’s vehicle of
unacceptable quality because “the risk has not
been excluded for the
realistic life of the good”. This reverses the onus of proof. It was for
the appellant to demonstrate,
on the balance of probabilities, that his vehicle
was of unacceptable quality. As his Honour found at [145], the appellant had not
sought to demonstrate that the alleged risk could eventuate during any
meaningful timeframe.
is said that contrary to his Honour’s finding at [153], there was evidence
that the risk of rupture/mis-deployment was real
and meaningful to a consumer.
requires an assessment of whether there is an aspect of the good that
a reasonable consumer would regard as making the good not of
acceptable quality.
The focus on the factors in
and (3), which direct attention to the use
and nature of the goods, emphasises that the inquiry is directed to the extent
the goods in fact fulfil the reasonable expectations of a reasonable
consumer. Relevantly, in this case,
directs attention to the practical
consequences for a consumer of the functional impact of the airbags on the use
and safety of the
reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the state and condition of the goods
(including any hidden defects of the goods), would
regard as acceptable having
regard to the matters in
, that the functionality of the airbag for the
use and safety of the appellant’s vehicle was the same as compared with
airbags. A merely speculative theoretical possibility of a risk of rupture
of the airbag not within any meaningful timeframe, would
not be regarded as
unacceptable by a reasonable consumer.
was no error by his Honour in finding at [156] that the hypothetical reasonable
consumer would also be acquainted with the fact
that there was no reason to
think that, probably, the outcomes of rupture or mis-deployment “will
happen at some stage”
in any Volkswagen and thus in the appellant’s
vehicle. His Honour was correct to conclude that the appellant had failed to
establish a breach of the consumer guarantee of acceptable quality in
1-4, 6 and 8 should be rejected.
Answers to common questions
the conclusions on grounds 1-9, the contention in ground 10 that his Honour
erred in answering questions 3, 4, 10 and 11 in
the negative should be rejected.
Other grounds
above conclusions are decisive of the appeal. While not strictly necessary to
consider the other grounds relating to the defence
under s 271(2) and damages,
this is a case which in accordance with

Explanatory Memorandum to the
Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer
Law) Bill (No 2) 2010
(the 2010 Explanatory Memorandum) states at par 7.126 that
s 271(2) “ensures that manufacturers are not held liable for issues
goods that are beyond their control”. The three exceptions in
s 271(2) address different subject matters: sub-par (a)
deals with the
acts, defaults, omissions or representations by persons, other than the
manufacturer, that might affect compliance
with the statutory guarantee; sub-par
(b) deals with events independent of human control provided they occurred
the goods left the control of the manufacturer; and sub-par (c)
deals with the price charged by the supplier, that might affect compliance
the statutory guarantee.
The pleaded defence
pleaded the exception in s 271(2)(a) in answer to the claims of the appellant
and group members for any non-compliance with the
consumer guarantee in s 54
(which was denied). The particulars of this defence included that Takata was
responsible for the design,
development and production of the Takata airbags
installed in the VW Vehicles.
relied on Mr Schade’s evidence that airbag inflators are a complex
subsystem within a vehicle and require specialist expertise
to design, develop,
manufacture and test, and in acquiring these systems from third party suppliers,
VW AG relied on their expertise
and also required suppliers of airbag systems to
meet quality and safety requirements for the systems specified by VW AG. Mr
gave evidence that:
development phase for the production of a vehicle, VW AG sends to the relevant
supplier a “Book of Requirements”
and specification drawings under
the cover of a “nomination letter” which sets out the requirements
that the supplier
needs to meet when developing the airbag module under its
contract with VW AG for the supply of those systems. (An example of a Book
Requirements in respect of a Polo A5 was in evidence);
constraints under German law pertaining to the handling of explosives (the
“Sprengstoffgesetz”) apply to the handling,
production and testing
of the pyrotechnic components of an airbag system. Neither VW AG nor any of its
employees has the necessary
approvals required by the Sprengstoffgesetz to
engage in all necessary activities for the handling, production and testing of
pyrotechnic
material that is used in airbag inflators;
developed airbag systems to be supplied to VW AG must undergo testing at the
supplier's facilities, to satisfy the specifications
notified by VW AG;
once a supplier
provides to VW AG a prototype of an airbag system, it has been VW AG’s
practice for a prototype to be installed
in a vehicle and subjected to further
testing by VW AG. The nature of the testing is: (a) combined steering wheel and
airbag component
tests (specifically for frontal driver airbags), (b) sled
testing and, (c) vehicle crash tests; and
practice at VW AG that these tests are conducted before it approves an airbag
system for series production. Once series
production has commenced, the system
supplier will conduct additional periodic conformity of production tests of the
airbag modules
during the production period of the particular model. VW AG also
undertakes its own full vehicle crash testing of production series
The submissions at trial
said that neither VW AG nor VW was responsible for the design of the airbags,
and they both relied on Takata. To the extent that
the use of PSAN in the Takata
airbag inflators constituted a relevant defect, it was said that defect with the
goods only arose because
of the acts of Takata in designing and building the
airbag inflators using PSAN.
appellant submitted that the exception in s 271(2)(a) did not apply because:
Where the good is not fit for purpose before it leaves the manufacturer’s
control, the non-compliance cannot be only because
of someone else. This is so
even where primary responsibility for the defective part lies with a third party
supplier; if nothing
else, the non-compliance must be at least partially because
of the manufacturer’s decision to release the good for sale, as
its selection of the supplier and/or selection and policing of specifications
and quality standards (even if the manufacturer
exercised reasonable care and
skill). The fact that Takata manufactured the airbags on contract for the
defendant does not exonerate
the defendant from liability.
The primary judge’s reasons
Honour made the following findings concerning the design and manufacture of the
airbags in the VW Vehicles at [35]-[38]:
VW AG did not manufacture the airbags. Airbag systems are complex and require
specialist expertise to design, develop, manufacture
and test. Indeed, VW AG
does not hold the German legal approvals necessary to produce airbag systems.
VW AG gave Takata specifications in respect of the airbags in a “Book of
Requirements”. The Book of Requirements contained
specification drawings,
under cover of a “nomination letter”, setting out certain
requirements that Takata was required
to meet when designing the airbag system.
The specifications that VW AG gave Takata included performance specifications
for the inflators, including that, at room temperature,
inflation should occur
within the range of 24 to 33 milliseconds.
However, and critically, VW AG did not specify what propellant should be used in
the airbags. Takata chose to use PSAN as the propellant.
of these findings are challenged on appeal.
the assumption that the appellant’s vehicle was not of acceptable quality,
his Honour found at [173] that the guarantee under
s 54 does not apply by reason
of the exception in s 271(2)(a). It is convenient to set out in full his
Honour’s reasons at
[162]-[170]:
In this hypothetical circumstance, the reason that VW did not comply with the s
54 guarantee is because the airbag in the plaintiff’s
vehicle used PSAN as
the propellant and because PSAN has a propensity to degrade.
VW AG did not design the airbag and did not specify what propellant should be
used, let alone specify that PSAN should be used. Only
Takata was responsible
for the design and manufacture of the airbag and for the decision to use PSAN as
the propellant.
But for Takata’s decision to use PSAN as the propellant, there would have
been no breach by VW of the s 54 guarantee of the
kind contended for by the
plaintiff. There is no other circumstance that, in this hypothetical scenario,
has led to VW being in breach
of the guarantee.
It is true that VW AG installed the airbag, but there is no suggestion here that
the manner of airbag installations was causative
of the plaintiff’s
vehicle not being of acceptable quality.
It is also true that VW “supplied” the vehicle to the plaintiff for
the purpose of s 54.
But the guarantee under s 54 only arises when there has been such a supply. The
exemption in s 271(2) can only arise if there has
been such a supply. Otherwise,
there could be no guarantee “not complied with”. The exemption in s
271(2) presupposes
that the manufacturer in question has “supplied”
the goods and then posits a circumstance where the breach of the guarantee
thereby arising occurs “only because” of the conduct of another.
The fact that, on this hypothesis, the plaintiff’s vehicle was not
“acceptable” from the time of its manufacture
takes matters no
further. Subsection 271(2)(b) deals expressly, and alternatively, with causes
“after the goods left the control
of the manufacturer”. This makes
clear that the legislature did not intend that the exception in s 271(2) be so
The plaintiff also submitted that VW’s non-compliance with s 54 in this
hypothetical circumstance was not “only”
because of Takata’s
acts, defaults or omissions but also because of VW’s own selection of
Takata as its subcontractor
and VW’s “selection and policing of
specifications and quality standards” even if it “exercised
care and skill”.
In effect, the submission was that the mere fact that VW chose Takata as its
airbag supplier was itself a reason for its failure
to comply with the s 54
guarantee. But that reading of s 271(2)(a) would leave it having no work to do.
That subsection is clearly
directed to acts, faults and omissions of parties
other than the manufacturer itself. If the mere engagement by the manufacturer
of such a third party was sufficient to exclude the subsection’s
operation, I find it hard to see what operation the subsection
could have.
Grounds 11-14
11-14 contend:
11. The primary judge erred in failing to hold that s 271(2) of
the ACL did not apply.
12. The primary judge erred in effectively importing a
negligence or fault standard into what is a strict liability regime.
13. The primary judge ought to have held that on the proper
construction of s 271(2) of the ACL, non-compliance with the guarantee
“only because of” the act, default or omission of another if the
manufacturer had no control over the good between
the relevant act, default or
omission and the supply.
14. The primary judge erred in answering common question 18,
yes. His Honour ought to have answered it, no.
11 is a general ground. Grounds 12 and 13 challenge his Honour’s
construction of s 271(2). Ground 14 incorrectly states
that the answer given to
question 18 was “yes” when the answer was “[g]iven the answers
to Questions 3, 4 and 11,
it is not necessary to answer this question”.
Ground 14 depends on the outcome of the preceding grounds.
is convenient first to address the causal relationship required by the phrase
“only because of” in s 271(2).
“only because of”
phrase “only because of” is a relational term. The approach to
construing relational terms is explained by French
R v Khazaal
(2012) 246 CLR 601
[2012] HCA 26
. In s 272(2), the phrase refers to
a causal connection between the non-compliance with the guarantee of acceptable
quality and the
specified matter in the three exceptions under s 271(2). The
requisite nexus between the non-compliance with the consumer guarantee
acceptable quality and the specified matter in s 271(2) is that the latter must
be the “only” reason for the failure
of the good to comply with the
consumer guarantee. Relevantly, in this case, s 271(2)(a) requires that an act,
default or omission
of any person, other than the manufacturer or its employee
or agent, must be the “only” reason for the failure of the
comply with the consumer guarantee.
is to be contrasted with the phrase “by reason of” in the
predecessor provision in TPA, s 74D(2)(a), which is an
expression that
generally requires a causal connection between two matters, but it need not be
direct or proximate: see, for example,
in other statutory contexts,
Public Transport Corporation
[1991] HCA 49
(1991) 173 CLR 349
[1991] HCA 49
Republic of Croatia v Sneddon
(2010) 241 CLR 461
(French CJ), [53], [69] (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ).
temporal limitation applies to the exception in s 271(2)(a) for an act, default
or omission of another person, unlike TPA, s 74D(2)
which explicitly imposed a
temporal limitation on the specified matters in sub-pars (i) and (ii) of
s 74D(2) ((i) an act or default
of any person, or (ii) a cause independent
of human control “occurring
the goods have left the control
of the manufacturer” (emphasis added)). By contrast, this temporal
limitation continues to
apply to the exception in s 271(2)(b) for a cause
independent of human control, and it also applies the same exception in s 259(5)
for a supplier of goods.
absence of any temporal limitation in s 271(2)(a) compared to s 271(2)(b) and s
259(5), together with the drafting change to sub-par
(i) of TPA, s 74D(2)
strongly suggests that it is not possible to read the qualification in s
271(1)(b) and s 259(5) into the exception
in s 271(2)(a). The exception in s
271(2)(a) is satisfied where the only cause of non-compliance with the consumer
guarantee in s
54 is an act, default or omission of any person, other than the
manufacturer or its employees or agents, occurring before or after
left the control of the manufacturer.
Who is the manufacturer in
obligation under s 271 is imposed on the manufacturer of the goods.
“Manufacturer” has an extended definition in s
7(1): see [42] above.
As the 2010 Explanatory Memorandum states at par 2.37:
The meaning of manufacturer encompasses a wide range of activities that
represent the first point in the chain of distribution of
a product into an
Australian market, whether directly by a person, or in that person’s name
is common ground that both VW AG and VW is a manufacturer. VW AG is “a
person who ... produces ... or assembles goods”
within s 7(1)(a). And, as
the importer of the VW Vehicles into Australia at a time when VW AG did not have
a place of business in
Australia, VW is taken to be a manufacturer within s
7(1)(e). No point was taken by VW at trial that the definition of
“manufacturer”
in s 7(1)(e) does not expressly state that the
importer is taken to be the manufacturer for
purposes of the ACL,
such as in s 271(2).
this Court, VW said that there may be a distinct question of construction of
s 271(2)(a) in an action against the importer, who
is taken to be a
manufacturer by operation of s 7(1)(e), if the act, default or omission that
made the goods non-compliant with the
consumer guarantee includes that of the
actual manufacturer located outside Australia. VW said that it is not necessary
to determine
this question as it does not arise in this case because neither
VW AG nor VW was relevantly responsible for the defect in the VW
in oral argument, VW implicitly conceded that in an action against the importer,
who is taken to be a manufacturer by operation
of s 7(1)(e), the reference
to the “manufacturer” in s 271(2) included both the actual
manufacturer located overseas
and the importer of the goods. That should be
accepted. In the circumstances of this case, the reference to the
“manufacturer”
in s 271(2)(a) should be read distributively to
include both the actual manufacturer, VW AG, and the importer, VW. That is for
the same meaning should be given to the same words appearing in different parts
of a statute unless there is reason to
do otherwise:
The King v Jacobs Group
(Australia) Pty Ltd (formerly known as Sinclair Knight Merz)
[2023] HCA 23
, referring to
Registrar of Titles (WA) v Franzon
[1975] HCA 41
(1975) 132 CLR
at 618 (Mason J);
[1975] HCA 41.
Neither party suggested that there was a
reason to do otherwise in s 271(1) and (2) with respect to the word
“manufacturer”.
word manufacturer in s 271(2) is to be construed in light of the context, the
general purpose and policy of s 271 which is to
give consumers rights and
protections that previously (prior to the TPA) were not available against a
manufacturer. The extended
definition of manufacturer in s 7(1) is flexible
enough to refer in s 271(1) and (2) to both the actual manufacturer located
Australia and the importer of the goods, where the circumstances
mentioned in s 7(1)(e) are satisfied.
should strive to read provisions of a statute in a harmonious way:
Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority
(1998) 194 CLR 355
. A narrow meaning of the word “manufacturer” in
s 271(2) which excludes the actual manufacturer located outside Australia,
the importer satisfies the extended definition of manufacturer, would not be
consistent with the purpose of s 271(1) which is
to make “the”
manufacturer liable to compensate the consumer for the failure to comply with
the consumer guarantee of
acceptable quality in s 54.
Application of the “other person” exception in s
appellant relies upon two reasons which are said to demonstrate error in his
Honour’s finding that the assumed defect only
arose because of the act of
Takata in deciding to use PSAN as the propellant: at [164].
12, as explained in written submissions, contends that the effect of his
Honour’s construction of s 271(2)(a) is to transform
manufacturer
liability for breach of consumer guarantees from strict liability into
fault-based liability, if and to the extent that
subcontractors are engaged. It
is said that this would allow an easy means for manufacturers to circumvent the
consumer guarantees.
ground misstates the exception in s 271(2)(a). The exception directs attention
to the fact or facts which made the goods of unacceptable
quality under s 54.
Having identified that fact or facts, the question is whether the goods were not
of acceptable quality
because of, relevantly, an act, default or
omission of any person, other than the manufacturer or an employee or agent of
the manufacturer.
exception in s 271(2)(a) draws the line at the conduct in respect of which the
manufacturer is strictly liable as its own conduct
and that of its employees or
agents. It was not suggested that Takata was an agent of VW AG. It was common
ground at trial that Takata
was a third party supplier to VW AG. The words in s
271(2)(a) are clear and must be given effect according to their terms without
the unwarranted gloss suggested by the appellant. If the sole cause of what made
the goods non-compliant with the consumer guarantee
in s 54 is an act, default
or omission of a third party supplier to the manufacturer, there is no reason to
deny the operation of
the exception to a manufacturer. Ground 12 should be
13 contends that non-compliance with the guarantee could be “only because
of” the act, default or omission of another
if the manufacturer had no
control over the good between the relevant act, default or omission and the
supply. The matter was put
a little differently in writing. It is said that the
exception in s 271(2)(a) only applies when the breach of the consumer guarantee
is triggered
by matters in respect of which the manufacturer had
no “involvement or responsibility” in what made the goods
non-compliant
with the consumer guarantee.
appellant said that the “manufacturer” had at least the following
“involvement” in the non-compliance
with the consumer guarantee in
respect of the Takata airbags: (i) it arranged for Takata to manufacture the
airbags and permitted
Takata to select the propellant (and presumably accepted
proof from Takata that the airbag module was designed so as to ensure consistent
functional safety over the service life of the vehicle); (ii) it installed the
airbags so manufactured into the vehicles; and (iii)
it released each vehicle
for supply.
“release” argument was put in these terms in the appellant’s
submissions in reply:
... it is impossible to see how a failure to comply with the acceptable quality
guarantee could be “only because of”
the act or omission of another
person where the reason for noncompliance was a defective component in the good
when it was
by the manufacturer. It is said that, at the very
least, the noncompliance would be partially because the manufacturer
to have the particular component installed in the good and
the good in that state. Obviously, the appellant does not suggest
that the act of release of a non-defective good is a "but for"
cause of any
non-compliance that arises from supervening events [Emphasis added].
argument is based on the acts of VW AG in “choosing” Takata to
manufacture the airbags, in “installing”
the airbags as manufactured
by Takata, and in “releasing” the VW vehicles in that state. But the
argument confuses the
steps taken by VW AG in obtaining and installing
components manufactured by third party suppliers and releasing the goods in that
state for supply to consumers, which are a necessary precondition of liability
for any failure to comply with the consumer guarantee
of acceptable quality,
with the question of whether the vehicle was non-compliant with the consumer
because an act, default or omission of any person, other
than the manufacturer. A similar distinction was drawn by Gummow J in
Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No
[1987] FCA 230
(1987) 16 FCR 410
at 419 between necessary preconditions
and an effective cause in the context of claims for “loss or damage”
was no error by his Honour in rejecting the “choice” or
“selection” of third party supplier argument
at [170]. The
circumstance that VW AG “chose” Takata as its airbag supplier was
not what made the VW Vehicles of unacceptable
quality, assuming it constitutes a
relevant defect in the Takata airbags to have used PSAN as the propellant.
was there an error by his Honour in rejecting the installation argument at
[165]. The circumstance that VW AG installed the Takata
airbags is not what made
the VW Vehicles of unacceptable quality, on the present assumption. As his
Honour noted at [165], there
was no suggestion that the manner of airbag
installations was causative of the appellant’s vehicle not being of
quality. The related argument that VW AG “chose” to have
the particular component (the airbag module) installed in the
vehicle, is
another way of putting the installation argument.
there was no error by his Honour in rejecting the “supply” argument.
The circumstance that VW AG released the
goods to VW for supply to consumers is
not what made the goods non-compliant with the consumer guarantee, on the
present assumption.
As his Honour observed at [167], the premise of the
exception in s 271(2)(a) is that the manufacturer has supplied goods to a
argument that VW AG “permitted” Takata to select the propellant was
not put in those terms at trial. But in any event,
this ignores the unchallenged
findings at [38] that the use of PSAN as the propellant was not specified by
VW AG, and the design
choice to use PSAN was made by Takata.
is said that VW AG had “involvement or responsibility” in what made
the goods non-compliant with the consumer guarantee
“presumably” accepted proof from Takata that the airbag module was
designed so as to ensure consistent functional
safety over the service life of
the vehicle, as required by the “lifetime requirements”
specification. This was a reference
to the “lifetime requirements”
specification in relation to the airbag module contained in the Book of
Requirements which
VW AG gave Takata. But it was not put to Mr Schade in
cross-examination that VW AG omitted to take any relevant step in this regard.
Nor was it suggested in submissions that there was any default or omission by VW
AG in accepting proof from Takata that the airbag
was designed to meet the
“lifetime requirements” specification.
error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s contingent finding that the
exception in s 271(2)(a) applied. Grounds 11 and
13 should be rejected. Ground
14 challenging the answer to question 18 should also be
questions 17, 19 and 20A articulated the damages claimed on behalf of group
members under two heads of damage:
(1) Questions 17 and 19 asked, “can the Group Members have suffered any
loss or damage, in the form of a reduction in the ‘true
the vehicle] as at the date of purchase, attributable to the [vehicle] not being
of” “merchantable quality”
(Q17) or “acceptable
quality” (Q19), in circumstances in which the airbag has been or can be
replaced at no cost to the
Group Member?
(2) Question 20A asked, “can the Group Members have suffered any loss or
damage, in the form of disappointment/ distress and/
or anxiety”, in
circumstances in which the airbag has been or can be replaced at no cost to the
Group Member?
final written submissions at trial, three potential approaches to the
appellant’s claim for damages under s 272(1) were identified:
(1) reduction in value
: award the appellant the difference between the
price paid and the “true value” at the time (of supply);
left in the hand
”: award the appellant the difference
between the price paid and the current value of the vehicle; and
do the best
”: the Court should “do the best”
to arrive at a damages figure by an award of either:
(1) a portion of the difference between the price paid by
the appellant for his vehicle and its “true value”, being
the number of years that the vehicle was “defective” over the total
number of years from purchase to judgment,
(2) interest at an appropriate rate on the difference
between the price paid and the “true value” over the period during
which the vehicle was “defective”.
is not necessary to refer to his Honour’s reasons for rejecting the
appellant’s claim under s 272(1)(b) for damages
for disappointment,
distress or anxiety, as there is no challenge to this finding.
The primary judge’s reasons
Honour rejected the appellant’s claim under s 272(1)(a) on two bases.
the appellant was only entitled to damages for loss actually suffered because
the question posed by s 272(1)(a) is what damage
the appellant has now suffered
“for” any reduction in value below the purchase price
“resulting from” any
failure by VW to comply with the s 54
guarantee. Reference was made to
Kizbeau Pty Ltd v WG & B Pty Ltd
[1995] HCA 4
(1995) 184 CLR 281
[1995] HCA 4
this approach, his Honour concluded at [195] that the appellant has not suffered
any financial loss, giving five reasons:
(i) the airbag has since been replaced
at no cost; (ii) the appellant has had full use of the vehicle since he acquired
there has never been any performance issue with the airbag associated
with the alleged defect; (iv) the appellant has not been involved
accident so as to trigger deployment of the airbag; and (iv) the appellant
continues to own a vehicle that is as valuable
as an ordinary car of that age
and type: at [196]-[201]. His Honour found that “[t]he effect of such
replacement [of the airbag]
is that such defect, as may hitherto have affected
the vehicle’s value, has been removed”: at [205].
the appellant had not proved damage in any of the three ways in which the
appellant put his claim in final submissions: (1)
reduction in value, (2)
“left in the hand”, or (3) the court should “do the
best” to arrive at a damages
figure: at [184]-[187].
to (1), the appellant’s case was that a discount of about 30 per cent to
the purchase price should be applied, had the true
facts been known. This
discount was based on Prof Michelle Baddeley’s survey-type evidence that
the market price of affected
new Volkswagen vehicles would have been about
30 per cent lower than the actual price, had the risks associated with the
Takata airbags
been disclosed to the market.
Honour gave detailed reasons for finding at [223] that no weight could be given
to the discrete choice experiments conducted by
Prof Baddeley, including
the fundamental flaws in her work (at [230]), and the methodological problems
which caused the surveys to
be “confusing” (at [249]-[251]), none of
which reasons were challenged on appeal. His Honour concluded at [252] that
experiments were “deeply flawed”, of no value to the task at hand,
and cast no light on the “true value”
of the appellant’s
vehicle at the time he purchased it.
to (2), his Honour rejected the “left in the hand” claim because:
(i) it would put the appellant in the same financial
position as he was when his
vehicle was a brand new car, (ii) the argument was first raised in closing
submissions, was not pleaded,
was not opened on and was not the subject of any
evidence, and (iii) the framework of s 272 is not apt to accommodate damages
this way: at [259]-[262].
to (3), his Honour rejected each of the suggested “do my best”
approaches because they did not take account of the
fact that such
“defect” as may have been present in the appellant’s vehicle
had been remedied, and the approaches
assumed that the appellant is now in a
position of having suffered financial loss when he had not: at [265]-[267].
Grounds 15-20
appellant did not press ground 15 which contends that his Honour erred in his
approach to the award of damages under s 272(1).
16-20 contend:
16. The primary judge erred in rejecting and placing no weight
on Professor Baddeley's discrete choice experiments as evidence
of the value of
the appellant's vehicle, having regard to:
(a) the findings on liability which his Honour ought to have
(b) the fact that the respondent would not have offered a
vehicle with a defective airbag for sale, such that a sale transaction
appellant's vehicle would not have taken place.
17. Alternatively, given 16(b), the primary judge ought to have
held that the value of the appellant's vehicle for the purposes
of s272(1) was
18. The primary judge ought to have held that the appellant was
entitled to damages under s272 of the ACL, calculated on the basis
(a) The full amount of the purchase price paid for the vehicle,
on the basis that the value of the vehicle was nil;
(b) Alternatively, a proportion of the purchase price paid for
the vehicle, on the basis that the value of the vehicle was greater
than nil but
less than the price paid, placing some weight on the discrete choice
experiments;
(c) Alternatively, the difference between the purchase price
paid for the vehicle and the value of the vehicle at the time of hearing
"left in the hand" approach);
(d) Alternatively, some proportion of (a), (b) or (c) to
reflect the fact that the appellant had a vehicle that was of unacceptable
quality for some six years, until airbags were replaced; and/or:
(e) Interest on (a), (b) or (c), or the additional
interest/financing costs that the appellant paid under which financing facility
based on (a), (b) or (c);
(f) GST on (a), (b) or (c);
(g) stamp duty on (a), (b) or (c).
19. The primary judge ought to have held that damages in
accordance with ground 18 are available notwithstanding that the defective
airbags have now been replaced at the respondent's cost.
20. The primary judge ought to have answered each of common
question 17, 19 and 20A, yes.
grounds fall into two categories. Some grounds challenge the rejection of the
appellant’s individual claim. In this category,
grounds 16, 17 and 18(a)
and (b) challenge the rejection of the reduction in value claim, alternatively,
ground 18(c) challenges
the rejection of the “left in the hand”
claim, ground 18(d) was not the subject of specific submissions, and grounds
18(e), (f) and (g) advance a new claim for consequential loss under s 272(1)(b)
for excess financing costs and excess taxes.
grounds are relied upon in support of both the appellant’s individual
claim and the claims of the group members. Ground
19 raises an issue of
construction as to whether subsequent events may be taken into account in
assessing any reduction in value
under s 272(1)(a). Grounds 18(e), (f) and
(g) relating to the claim for consequential loss under s 272(1)(b) are also
relied upon
on behalf of group members. Ground 20 challenges the answers to
questions 17, 19 and 20A, and depends on the outcome of the preceding
is convenient to address these grounds in the following order: (1) the proper
approach to the assessment of reduction in value
damages under s 272(1)(a), (2)
the appellant’s individual claim, and (3) the new damages claim under
s 272(1)(b).
The proper approach to the assessment of
reduction in value damages
271(1) creates a statutory cause of action. It entitles affected persons to
damages from the manufacturer for non-compliance
with the consumer guarantee of
acceptable quality in s 54. Section 272(1) states the type of damages a consumer
is entitled to claim
under s 271, being any reduction in value of the goods
“resulting from” the failure to comply with the statutory guarantee
(s 272(1)(a)) and any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage,
including consequential loss (s 272(1)(b)).
word “damages” in ss 271 and 272 is used in the sense of statutory
compensation. Two issues of construction arise
in relation to s
(1) the point in time for assessing damages for any reduction in the value of
the goods; and
(2) whether events or information obtained after the time of supply can be taken
into account.
Time for assessment of any reduction in value
was and is common ground between the parties that any reduction in value of the
goods is to be assessed by reference to the time
of acquisition of the goods,
that is, the
time of supply
. That is consistent with the statutory
language in s 272(1)(a), given that each of the integers by which reduction in
the value of
the goods is assessed is a price referable to the time of supply.
It also accords with views expressed in:
[880], where Perram J said that “[t]he correct question is what the value
was when the [claimant] purchased it”;
Vautin v By
Winddown, Inc (formerly Bertram Yachts) (No 4)
[2018] FCA 426
, where Derrington J said at [229] in obiter that
“presumably” reduction in value is measured at the date of supply
a claim under s 259(3) and took the same view at [340] for a claim under s
272(1)(a); and
Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd
(Initial Trial)
, where Lee J concluded at [309] that the point in time for assessing damages
for any reduction in the value of the goods is the time
this Court reserved judgment on the appeal, the Full Federal Court expressed a
qualification to the time for assessment of reduction
in value damages in
Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Williams
[2023] FCAFC 50
408 ALR 582.
Although Moshinsky, Colvin and Stewart JJ
accepted that
“generally” or in “most cases” it will be appropriate to
assess damages for any reduction in
the value of the goods by reference to the
time of supply
(at [98], [100]), their Honours said that, depending on
the circumstances, the assessment of whether the claimant has suffered loss
damage “may require” “a departure from the time of supply or
an adjustment to avoid over-compensation”
main reasons were given why this may be necessary. One is that the word
“damages” in s 272 imports a requirement that
the applicant for
relief must have suffered loss or damage, and this requirement is not to be
displaced by the “explicit or
implicit reference to the time of
supply” in s 272(2)(a)(i) and (ii) (at [99]). The other is that, like
the cases involving
general law damages, the overarching consideration to award
appropriate compensation may require flexibility in applying the general
that damages are assessed as at the time of supply (at [102]-[103]).
is not necessary to consider the qualification stated in
that a “departure” from assessment of damages under s
272(1)(a), at the time of supply, is appropriate in some cases.
Although the
decisions in the
cases were drawn to this Court’s attention
by the appellant (with the consent of VW), neither party sought leave to
their submissions, which were common ground, that the assessment of
damages for any reduction in the value of the goods is by reference
time of supply
Whether subsequent events can be taken
into account
the use of PSAN in the airbag inflator was a latent defect, the parties diverged
as to whether his Honour erred in having
regard to the subsequent replacement of
the airbag, at no cost, when assessing whether the appellant had suffered damage
272(1)(a). The essential difference between the parties is whether in
assessing statutory damages of the kind referred to in s 272(1)(a)
of the ACL,
it is an error to have regard to common law principles for the assessment of
Submissions
appellant accepted that to take account of the replacement of the airbag at no
cost would be fatal to his case. In resisting that
approach, which the primary
judge adopted, the appellant said that the language of s 272(1)(a) does not
permit an assessment of any

having been being “fixed”.

s 272 by the use of the word “damages”
in that provision; (ii)
disregarding subsequent events coheres with s 271(6); (iii) any reduction in
value “can happen theoretically”;

submits that the analysis of the primary judge was plainly correct: any notional
reduction in value based on abstract propositions
could not be shown to have
caused the appellant any loss in circumstances where the appellant had
experienced no detrimental impact
of any supposed defect and the defect had been
wholly rectified, at no cost, before any risk of manifestation had arisen.
is said, by analogy with the High Court’s approach in
assessing damages under s 82 of the TPA, that the primary judge was right to
take into account the subsequent replacement of the
airbag at no cost in
analysing whether the appellant was entitled to damages under s 272(1)(a).
is well-established that “[t]he primary task is to construe the relevant
statutory provisions, rather than to draw an analogy
with claims under the
general law”:

(Leeming JA, Bathurst
CJ and Meagher JA agreeing), referring to the joint judgment in
Overton Investments Pty Ltd

(McHugh J) and
GIO Australia Holdings Ltd
(1998) 196 CLR 494
[1998] HCA 69
(McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ).
Nevertheless,
the assessment of damages for the relevant statutory purpose may be informed by
a consideration of common law principles
for the assessment of damages,
particularly where those principles relate to a claim with a close analogy to
the claim being considered.
In such circumstances, general law principles may
provide “useful guidance” or be an “appropriate guide”:
Henville v Walker
(2001) 206 CLR 459
[2001] HCA 52
(Gleeson CJ),
[130] (McHugh J). As Gleeson CJ explained at [18], in the context of claims for
damage under s 82 of the TPA, general
law analogies may provide useful
... for the reason that they have had to respond to problems of the same nature
as the problems which arise in the application of
the Act. They are not
controlling, but they represent an accumulation of valuable insight and
experience which may well be useful
in applying the Act.
statutory cause of action in ACL, s 271 and its predecessor TPA, s 74D(1), does
not operate on any contract. However, as Perram
by reference to the observations of Edelman J in
Moore v Scenic Tours Pty
(2020) 268 CLR 326
[2020] HCA 17
in relation to the
similar provisions of the ACL (s 267(3) and (4)), s 272(1)(a) and (b) resemble
the two components of compensatory
damages available at common law for breach of
contract: (1) compensation directly for the performance interest, and (2)
compensation
for consequential losses. Perram J observed in
[891] that this might suggest that the point of an award of damages is to put
the claimant “in the position she would have
been in if the [thing
acquired] had been of acceptable quality”. The appellant did not argue to
the contrary.
task of the Court under statutory provisions such as 272(1) “is to select
a measure of damages which conforms to the remedial
purpose of the statute and
to the justice and equity of the case”:
Henville v Walker
(Gleeson CJ). The 2010 Explanatory Memorandum at par 7.120 notes that the
primary contact point for consumers when they buy
goods is the supplier (against
whom remedies are provided in Div 1 of Pt 5-4 of the ACL). The purpose of the
statute in Div 2 of
Pt 5-4 of the ACL, so far as presently relevant, is to
provide consumers with a remedy against the manufacturer of goods when goods
fail to meet the standard required by the guarantee of acceptable quality.
272(1)(a) entitles an affected person to recover compensation directly against
the manufacturer for the performance interest
that the goods meet the standard
required by the guarantee of acceptable quality. By analogy with contract
damages, the aim of this
component of damages is to provide the consumer with
the difference between the value of what was promised under the consumer
of acceptable quality and the value of what was received:
Scenic Tours
at [64] (Edelman J).
measure of damages under s 272(1)(a) is the difference between the true value of
the good as at the time of supply (resulting
from the failure to comply with
consumer guarantee) and the price paid for it, or the average retail price,
whichever is lower. Given
this comparison between the price paid and the true
value, as distinct from market value, subsequent events are potentially relevant
because they may illuminate or indicate or reflect the true value at the time of
consideration of subsequent events in the assessment of damages is not unusual
or novel. In
HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd
217 CLR 640
[2004] HCA 54
, the joint judgment observed at [39] that
at 291-296 (Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)
pointed out that, in many fields of law, assessments of compensation or
one date are commonly made taking into account all matters known by the later
date when the Court’s assessment is
being carried out. That included, as
noted at 291, that in an action in deceit, “subsequent
events that arise from the nature or use of the thing itself”
looked at “insofar as they illuminate the value of the thing as at [the
date of acquisition]”.
endorsed that approach in relation
to s 82 of the TPA when the Court is assessing damages by comparing the price
and the real value
of the asset at the date of the acquisition.
is no reason why the same approach should not be taken in relation to ACL, s
272(1). However, not all subsequent events will
be relevant. Subsequent events
as a consequence of inherent factors present in the thing itself at the
acquisition date, which “illuminate”
or indicate or reflect the true
value as at the acquisition date, must be taken into account. Subsequent events
as a consequence
of independent, extrinsic, supervening or accidental factors
must not be taken into account:
HTW Valuers v Astonland
at [40]. Whether
a subsequent event truly illuminates or indicates or reflects the measure of
loss earlier suffered depends on all
the circumstances:
HTW Valuers v
at [40], citing
Potts v Miller
[1940] HCA 43
(1940) 64 CLR 282
[1940] HCA 43

(1985) 157 CLR 215
(Gibbs CJ);
[1985] HCA 68.
of the arguments advanced by the appellant for the contrary view is compelling.
word “damages” in s 272(1) makes clear that the provision is
concerned with compensation for loss or damage:
at [99]. There is no inconsistency between assessing damages for
any reduction in value, at the time of supply, and taking into account
subsequent events which illuminate or indicate or reflect the value of the good
at the acquisition date.
to the appellant’s submission, s 271(6) is not determinative that
subsequent events must be disregarded in an action
under s 271(1). These
provisions deal with different subject matters: (i) s 271(1) is concerned with
the manufacturer’s failure
to comply with the consumer guarantee of
acceptable quality in s 54, and (ii) s 271(6) is concerned with the
manufacturer’s
refusal or failure, within a reasonable time, to repair or
replace the goods if the consumer has required the manufacturer to do
an express warranty. That the subject matter of s 271(6) concerns an express
warranty by a manufacturer to repair or replace
goods, says nothing of the
circumstance that in an action under s 271(1) to recover damages of the kind
referred to in s 272(1)(a),
the replacement of the goods at no cost may
illuminate or indicate or reflect the true value of the goods at the date of
in assessing damages under 272(1)(a).
appellant frankly acknowledged that the consequences of disregarding subsequent
events under s 272(1)(a) are a “little bit”
odd. Thus, it is
accepted that to disregard such events would have the consequence that an
affected person would be entitled to damages
for any failure to comply with the
consumer guarantee of acceptable quality, even if their vehicle was sold
the latent defect was discovered. Further, given the broad
definition of an “affected person” in s 2(1) includes a person
acquires goods from a consumer (other than for the purpose of re-supply), that
entitlement to damages would extend to a similarly
unaware purchaser in the
entire chain of persons who purchased the vehicles second-hand before the defect
was identified. Such consequences
would be inconsistent with the overarching
consideration that the amount of compensation for any reduction in value be
appropriate:
Toyota v Williams
to disregard subsequent events which illuminate or indicate or reflect the true
value of the good at the time of supply would
be inconsistent with the
“universal rule” that a plaintiff cannot recover more than he or she
Baxter v Obacelo
(2001) 205 CLR 635
[2001] HCA 66
(Gummow and Hayne JJ).
Kirk JA (Ward P agreeing) said of the circumstance in
Scenic Tours Pty
[2023] NSWCA 74
that some claimants against a
supplier of services had been awarded compensation under ACL, s 267(3) and (4)
for a necessary cost
of the contract being fulfilled (being expenditure on
airfares to travel to the cruise destination), whilst also obtaining
compensation
to put them in a position as if the consumer guarantees had been
...by obtaining compensation for a necessary cost of the contract being
fulfilled [relevantly, airfares to travel to the destination
of the cruise],
whilst also obtaining compensation to put them in a position as if the consumer
guarantees had been fulfilled, the
relevant claimants are placed in a superior
position to what they would have been in had the consumer guarantees been
fulfilled by
Scenic Tours. That is a form of double recovery, to which the law
has an abhorrence, reflecting in turn “the ‘universal’
that a plaintiff cannot recover more than he or she has lost”:
Obacelo Pty Ltd
(2001) 205 CLR 635
[2001] HCA 66
. There is no
reason to consider that s 267 was intended to be inconsistent with that
strong principle.
at [294], Derrington J said that double recovery is not
permissible in a claim against a supplier of goods for compensation under
259(4). There is no reason to consider that s 272, like similar remedial
provisions within Pt 5-4 of Ch 5 of the ACL, such
as s 267 and s 259, was
intended to be inconsistent with that “strong principle” referred to
Scenic Tours v Moore
the resemblance between the two components of damages referred to in s 272(1)(a)

analogy, when
assessing statutory damages under s 272(1):
HTW Valuers v
at [39]. If the replacement of the airbag in the appellant’s
vehicle is as a consequence of intrinsic or inherent factors in
the nature of
the vehicle, it is an event which must be taken into account in assessing under
s 272(1)(a) any reduction in value
damages at the time of
Application to the facts
is not in dispute, as VW submits, that the appellant acquired a mechanically
complex product – a vehicle – that requires
maintenance in order to
remain safe for use, and frequently has parts repaired and even replaced during
its lifetime. Given that
a vehicle should remain safe for use, it is inherent in
the nature of a vehicle that upon recognising a latent defect, the defective
part will be repaired or replaced as necessary. Assuming the airbag in the
appellant’s vehicle was a latent defect, that is
what occurred in this
to the appellant’s submission, this is not a question of quantifying a
mitigating benefit the appellant has received.
Whether there is
“any” reduction in the value of the appellant’s vehicle, at
the time of supply, directs attention
to the nature of the failure to comply
with the consumer guarantee. Here, the asserted problem with the
appellant’s vehicle
that is said to have reduced its value, at the time of
supply, has been fully rectified, at no cost, in a manner that a reasonable
consumer would have always expected given the nature of goods of this kind, if
the vehicle contained a latent defect. On the present
assumption, that was an
event that arose from the nature of the vehicle.
is said that the fatal flaw in VW’s submission is “assuming away
breach to get to a conclusion of no damage”.
This misunderstands the
submission. The premise of the submission is that the appellant’s vehicle
is not of acceptable quality
at the time of supply because the use of PSAN as a
propellant is a latent defect. The submission points to the rectification of the
assumed latent defect in a manner which a reasonable consumer would always have
expected, given the nature of the goods, as a subsequent
event which illuminates
or reflects or indicates the value of the appellant’s vehicle at the time
is it an answer for the appellant to say, as he does, that any reduction in
value “can happen theoretically”. Aside
from the obvious difficulty
in assessing damages based on a “theoretical” reduction in value, to
award damages on that
basis would be unprincipled. It would place the appellant
in a superior position to that which he would have been in had the guarantee
acceptable quality been fulfilled by VW, assuming a failure to comply with the
consumer guarantee in s 54. The appellant would
have received a vehicle
which he has used without incident and, which he accepts is, by reason of
replacement of the airbag, as valuable
today as it would have been had it been
supplied originally with non-defective airbags. The appellant cannot recover
more than his
actual loss such that “double recovery” is
impermissible. Nothing in s 272(1) suggests otherwise.

at no cost, when assessing damage for any reduction
in value of the
appellant’s vehicle as referred to in s 272(1)(a). Ground 19 should be
The appellant’s damages claim in this
writing, the appellant advanced the three claims for damages under s 272(1)
(see (1), (2) and (3)(a) below). In oral argument,
a further claim was advanced
(see (3)(b) below):
(1) reduction in value
: a claim under s 272(1)(a) for the difference
between the purchase price (about $40,000) and the “true” value of
vehicle at the time of supply;
(2) “left in the hand”
: a claim based on what was “left
in the hand”, which is said to be a proxy for damages under s 272(1)(b),
being a loss
of $15,000 calculated as the difference between the purchase price
(about $40,000) and the current value of the appellant’s
vehicle at trial
which is said to be $25,000; and/or
(3) consequential loss
: a claim under s 272(1)(b) for (a)
“excess” financing costs (interest) and “excess” taxes
(GST and stamp
duty) on the difference between the purchase price and the
“true” value of the vehicle at the time of supply; and (b)
on the cost of repair.
oral argument in reply, senior counsel for the appellant conceded that “a
lot of the methodology that we float in our written
submissions falls foul of
the statutory definition, and I accept that”. Given this concession, some
of the appellant’s
claims can be dealt with relatively briefly.
Reduction in value
writing, the appellant contended that the true value of his vehicle, at the time
of supply, was either: (i) nil, (ii) a value as
assessed by reference to
Prof Baddeley’s discrete choice experiments, or (iii) a value
assessed by the Court as a matter of
impression.
“Nil” value
is said, by application of market theory, that the appellant’s vehicle had
no value at the time of supply, and therefore
he should recover his full
purchase price. As the appellant acknowledged, this submission was not put at
trial. Indeed, in final
submissions at trial, senior counsel for the appellant
expressly disavowed this argument stating, “I’m not putting a
submission, as tempting as it is, that the car was worth zero”.
short answer to the “nil” value argument is that it was not pressed
in this Court in oral submissions. Senior counsel
for the appellant frankly
acknowledged that the argument was “too artificial” and said nothing
in support of it. Grounds
17 and 18(a) should be taken not to have been pressed.
it been necessary to determine VW’s objection to this claim as a new point
on appeal, the objection should be upheld. This
claim could possibly have been
met by calling evidence at the hearing:

30 per cent discount of purchase price
critical issues at trial were whether it was possible to reason from the
discrete choice experiments of Prof Baddeley and, if
so, what conclusions
might properly be drawn as to any reduction in value of the appellant’s
vehicle, at the time of supply,
assuming a failure to comply with the guarantee
of acceptable quality. It is said that his Honour erred in placing no weight on
Prof Baddeley’s evidence (ground 16), and that he should have placed
“some” weight on that evidence (ground 18(b)).
appellant accepts that there were imperfections in the discrete choice
experiments of Prof Baddeley, which could have been done
better. However,
it is said that it is obvious (by recourse to common sense or basic economic
theory) that the appellant’s
vehicle was worth less at the time of supply
than he paid for it.
attempt was made in oral argument to sustain the broad challenge in ground 16 to
the finding that no weight should be given to
the evidence of
Prof Baddeley. Nor did the appellant challenge the findings that there were
fundamental flaws in Prof Baddeley’s
work (at [230]), that she had
“allowed herself to become something of an advocate for” the
appellant and group members
(at [227]), and that there were methodological
problems with the surveys (at [249]-[251]).
the extent that the appellant urged the Court to give “a tiny bit of
weight” to what Prof Baddeley said in relation
to the discrete choice
experiments, the appellant did not identify any error in his Honour’s
findings. Grounds 16 and 18(b)

Inconsistently
with the submission that this Honour should have chosen a figure “as a
matter of impression”, the appellant
said that if VW had not fixed the
airbag, the “obvious” measure of any reduction in value under s
272(1)(a) is how much
it would cost to fix the airbag in the appellant’s
vehicle. The appellant acknowledged that this was not the way the case was
at trial, however, such an approach to assessing any reduction in value was
at [300]-[302], Derrington J treated the repair cost of
the good (a vessel) as the
prima facie
amount of the reduction in value.
course, had the appellant claimed loss for himself and on behalf of group
members based on the cost of repair, the claim would
have faced substantial
difficulties, given that the airbags have been replaced, at no cost to the
appellant and group members, and
the appellant and each group member had used
their vehicle since purchase without incident. But that does not undermine the
that the appellant failed to adduce precise, or reasonably precise
evidence of loss, being the cost of repair, when he was able to
do so. It simply
highlights that VW would have had a ready answer to such a claim.
is there is an analogy between this case and
where Perram J said at
[883]-[884] that it was “obvious” that Ms Capic’s vehicle was
worth less at the time of
its acquisition than she had paid for it, and that
“[t]he process of assessing what the value of a chattel was 9 years in the
past when the defects it suffered from are risks not actualities is inherently
impressionistic”.
is distinguishable on the basis that there
was expert evidence in that case, which Perram J accepted, that the
claimant’s vehicle
was worth less at the acquisition date than she paid
for it (at [883]).
statement in
that this was “obvious” reflected the
particular findings in that case that the transmission in the claimant’s
vehicle posed certain risks related to components within it, which were found to
be “real” risks (at [887]) based on
proven component failures (at
[884]) and a “high” risk of problems with normal operating
characteristics of the vehicle
(at [888]) in relation to gear rattling and a
slight shudder at low speeds. By contrast, in this case, the appellant framed
the asserted
risk of rupture as “unquantifiable”, there was no
proven rupture in the real-world experience, and there was no expert
that the appellant’s vehicle was worth less at the acquisition date than
he paid for it.
18(b) should be rejected.
“Left in the hand”
appellant accepted that his Honour’s conclusion at [254]-[255] that the
“left in the hand” measure of loss did
not fall within s 272(1)(a)
“appears to be correct”. That concession was properly made. The
enquiry as to the true value
at the date of supply is conceptually distinct from
enquiring into the current value of the relevant good, which is the wrong
for the purpose of s 272(1)(a):
writing, the appellant said that the “left in hand” approach is a
proxy for assessing the loss or damage suffered by
the affected person because
of the failure to comply with the guarantee in s 54 and therefore falls within
s 272(1)(b). By analogy
with the “no transaction” cases, such
HTW Valuers v Astonland

in the position he would have been in had he not spent his money on acquiring a
vehicle by receiving the purchase price that he would not have paid
and bringing to account the value of his vehicle that he still
appellant did not mention the “left in the hand” approach in oral
argument in chief, nor in reply after VW stated
in oral argument that it assumed
that this claim was not pressed. This claim should be taken not to have been
the claim had been pressed, it should be rejected for two reasons.
Pleading objection
appellant’s contention that VW was not prejudiced by the late notice of
this unpleaded claim cannot be accepted. When the
claim was first raised in
closing submissions, the appellant conceded that there was “no direct
evidence of sales in 2021”,
and pointed to the highest prices from the
eleven sales recorded in the Pickles sales data covering 2015-2018 for
second-hand Volkswagen
Passats manufactured on the same date as the
appellant’s vehicle at trial. This is the precise prejudice referred to by
Honour at [260]-[261].
was the belated “offer” by the appellant on the last day of trial (1
June 2021) that VW appoint an expert who would
inspect the vehicle and prepare a
report on its market value an adequate solution to the prejudice occasioned to
VW. There is no
reason not to accept senior counsel’s statement at trial,
which was repeated in this Court, that had the appellant claimed
this loss at
some point before closing submissions, VW would have put on evidence going
directly to the question of the vehicle’s
current value.
appellant should not be permitted to advance a new point on appeal which could
possibly have been met by calling evidence at the
Suttor v Gundowda
Coulton v Holcombe
“left in the hand” claim is not within s 272(1)
“left in the hand” claim assumes a “no transaction”
case, which is inconsistent with the rights given
in s 272(1) which are premised
on the transaction having taken effect:
at [891]. So much was
correctly accepted by the appellant in oral argument.
the premise of this claim under s 272(1)(b) is that the appellant acquired a
vehicle that was less valuable than the purchase
price. But this is inconsistent
with s 272(3), which indicates that any claim for loss or damage alleged to have
been “suffered
through a reduction in the value of the goods” must
be made under s 272(1)(a), not s 272(1)(b). As noted, the appellant accepts
the “left in the hand” claim does not come within s 272(1)(a).
18(c) should be rejected.
Consequential loss: interest, GST and
claim for “excess” financing costs (interest) and
“excess” taxes (GST and stamp duty) is put as a claim
consequential loss under s 272(1)(b). The appellant acknowledged that no
claim was made at trial for GST and stamp duty but said
that a claim for
interest was made.
is said that the appellant should be permitted to advance the claims for
interest and GST on appeal, as these claims “depend
on resolution of a
question of principle, not on any factual matter not debated at trial”.
The appellant pointed to documentary
evidence that he financed the purchase of
his vehicle, paying $6,133 in interest over five years and GST of $3,617.
is also said that whilst the appellant did not press his claim for stamp duty on
appeal, given the absence of evidence that he
paid stamp duty on the purchase,
the group members might be able to claim stamp duty after this Court
“resolve[s] the question
of principle” concerning whether those
amounts “are recoverable”.
claim for interest was put differently at trial. As his Honour observed at
[265(b)], the appellant contended in final submissions
that one “potential
approach” to the “do my best” assessment of damages was that
the court should award “interest”
at an appropriate rate on the
difference between the price paid and the true value “over the
period” during which the
vehicle was defective, being the period 2013 to
2019, before the airbag in the appellant’s vehicle was replaced.
stated premise of this approach was that replacement of the airbag in the
appellant’s vehicle in 2018 reduces, but does
not fully offset, that part
of the appellant’s loss that comprises the difference between the purchase
price and true value,
and some allowance should be made for the fact that for
most of the period of the appellant’s ownership, he has not had the
paid for. That claim was not pressed on appeal. In this Court, the
“interest” claim was put in two ways; neither
was run at trial, nor
pleaded, nor specified in the common questions.
financing costs
: It is said that the appellant and group members are
entitled to damages referable to the interest on the difference between the
purchase price and the “true” value of the vehicle, at the
time of supply. This assumed that the appellant had established by evidence
that his vehicle’s value was less than what he paid
for it, at the time of
supply, by reason of the defective airbags, and that he sustained detriment
arising from that state of affairs.
That is not so, for the reasons given above
in rejecting the reduction in value claim.
on the “cost of repair”
: It is said that fixing the airbag is a
proxy for paying reduction in value damages, and the appellant and group members
are entitled
to damages under s 272(1)(b) for consequential loss for being
“out of my money” for the period the airbag was not fixed.
premise of this claim is unsound. The appellant was never “out of my
money” for the cost of repair, nor were any
of the group members. There
can be no consequential loss for interest on the cost of repair of the airbag,
given the replacement
of the airbags was at no cost to the appellant and group
GST and stamp duty
is said that the appellant’s failure to contend at trial that the
available damage under s 272(1)(b) included “excess”
GST and stamp
duty paid in respect of the purchase is not fatal for three reasons: (i) a
distinction must be drawn between the appellant’s
individual claim and
claims on behalf of group members, (ii) the new claims sought to be raised on
appeal involve questions of law,
and (iii) the common questions can now be
amended to reflect the legal issues actually common to the appellant and group
to the first matter, the distinction between a plaintiff’s role as a party
advancing an individual claim and the representative
role of a plaintiff in
representative proceedings under
Civil Procedure Act
not contentious: see, for example,
BHP Group Ltd v Impiombato
[2021] FCAFC 93
. As observed in
Commonwealth
of Australia
(2019) 100 NSWLR 55
[2019] NSWCA 127
(Bell P, Bathurst CJ and Basten JA agreeing):
The representative proceedings regime [in Pt 10 of the CP Act] is concerned with
the common determination of
questions only. The regime directly
attends to the inevitability in representative proceedings that parts of the
proceedings will
not be common. (Emphasis in original.)
this distinction is no explanation for the appellant’s failure to make a
claim for himself and on behalf of group members
for GST and stamp duty.
to the second matter, even if it be assumed that the new claims only involved a
question of law, “[a] party does not have
a right to insist that a new
point be decided on appeal simply because all of the facts having been
established beyond controversy
or the point is one of construction or of
Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v Federal Airports Corporation
(1997) 47 NSWLR 631 at 645 (Mason P, Gleeson CJ and Priestley JA agreeing). It
always remains a question of whether it is “expedient
and in the interests
of justice” to entertain the point:
at 645 (Mason P),
Water Board v Moustakas
(1988) 180 CLR 491
[1988] HCA 12.
considering that question, it has been said that “the finality of
litigation and the importance of parties being bound
to the cases they make at
trial should never be overlooked”:
Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No
(2001) 117 FCR 424;
[2001] FCA 1833
(Allsop J, Drummond
and Mansfield JJ agreeing), referring among others to
Metwally v University
of Wollongong
[1985] HCA 28
; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71. See also:
Ltd v Shuetrim; Metlife Insurance Ltd v Shuetrim
(2016) 91 NSWLR 439
(Leeming JA, Beazley P and Emmett AJA agreeing).
this case, it would not be “expedient” or “in the interests of
justice” to permit the appellant to advance
for himself and on behalf of
group members new claims for GST and stamp duty which were not run at trial, nor
pleaded, nor specified
in the common questions. This is for several reasons.
is that there is no explanation for why these new claims were not advanced at
trial, including for the delay in raising the new
Aon Risk Services
Australia Ltd v Australian National University
(2000) 239 CLR 175
, [102]-[103] (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ). The
appellant has not identified any sufficient reason why he and group
should not be bound by the forensic choices made at trial, including as
representative plaintiff as reflected in the common
Water Board v
is that there is no reasoning by his Honour on the complex question of whether
and how damages for GST and stamp duty payments
fit within s 272(1) of the ACL.
The complexity is apparent from
at [891]-[898], [909]-[916], where
Perram J dealt with a similar claim for consequential losses.
reason relates to the third matter relied upon by the appellant. The premise of
the submission that the common questions can
now be amended is unsound. This
ignores the effect of
Civil Procedure Act
which is addressed
in the next section below.
even if the appellant was permitted to advance his new claim for GST on appeal
(noting that he did not pursue his individual
claim for stamp duty), for the
reasons already given at [282]
above, the premise of the
appellant’s claim for GST has not been established.
Amendment to the common questions
appellant said that VW’s criticism – that the common questions as
framed by the parties and adopted by the primary
judge do not raise the
questions of GST and stamp duty – treats the procedural device of common
questions as the master rather
than the servant. This submission overlooks that
Civil Procedure Act
creates its own kind of “statutory
estoppel” in
, as the similar provision in
Supreme Court Act 1986
, was described in
Finance Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Collins
(2016) 259 CLR 212
[2016] HCA 44
(French CJ, Kiefel, Keane and Nettle JJ).
179 requires that a judgment given in representative proceedings must describe
or otherwise identify the group members affected
by it and provides that the
judgment “binds all such persons” (subject to s 162 which is not
presently relevant, concerning
any person who has opted out of the proceedings).
It is established that group members in a representative proceeding are only
by the determination of the claims giving rise to the common questions,
but not with respect to the plaintiff’s individual
way the statutory scheme works to bind group members (as non-parties) to an
order made by the Court in proceedings under
Civil Procedure
is by operation of
Dyczynski v Gibson
(2020) 280 FCR 583
[2020] FCAFC 120
(Murphy and Colvin JJ) and [391] (Lee J);
Sàrl v Gill
(2021) 288 FCR 338
[2021] FCAFC 29
Murphy and Lee JJ). This is one of the reasons why it is critical for the
orderly conduct of a representative proceeding
to an initial
trial there is specificity in what common questions are being determined at
Gill v Ethicon Sàrl (No 3)
[2019] FCA 587
(2019) 369 ALR
(Lee J). This occurred in the present case. The interlocutory
decision and orders of Sackar J made on 21 June 2019, as varied on
22 May 2020,
identified the common questions for determination at trial.
is not in dispute, as VW submits, that questions 17, 19 and 20A articulated in
detail the damages claimed on group members’
behalf, and were carefully
framed to facilitate a determination, on a common basis, of the heads of loss
that were or were not claimable
by the group members. The framing of the common
questions in this case is to be distinguished from
Scenic Tours
where Appendix C records that common question 12, relevantly, posed the broader
question: “What heads of damage are recoverable
for a claim for
compensation under s 267 of the ACL?”.
is it in dispute, as VW submits, that the effect of
Procedure Act
is that the group members (as non-parties) are relevantly
bound by the statutory estoppel on the issues raised by questions 17, 19
at [249], [391];
Sàrl v Gill
appellant’s sole response to the statutory estoppel on the issues raised
by questions 17, 19 and 20A, is to suggest that
the common questions as framed
can now be amended “to reflect the resolution of the legal issues actually
common to the appellant
and group members”.

relevantly involved an unsuccessful application by the Commonwealth for leave to
appeal against the discretionary decision of the
trial judge declining to answer
common questions 22 and 23 in the negative or at all: at [238]. That was in
circumstances where,
although no formal order had been made by the trial judge
amending the terms of the common questions to reflect the way in which
representative party had ran the case at trial, the trial judge had found Mr
Searle’s abandonment of negligent misrepresentation
and deceit claims had
the effect of withdrawing questions 22 and 23 from determination in the hearing
but did not effect an abandonment
of those claims on behalf of all group
members: at [233].
the terms of the common questions was not in issue in
, given the concession on appeal by the Commonwealth. The Court
(Bell P, Bathurst CJ and Basten JA agreeing) held at [237] that it
only within power for the trial judge to decline to answer questions 22 and 23,
but entirely appropriate. As Bell P said
Senior counsel for the Commonwealth could not point to any authority in support
of his contention that the primary judge lacked power
to decline to answer a
common question which had been formulated for determination at a hearing of
representative proceedings. That
was not surprising, and the submission as to
lack of power is wholly inconsistent with the flexible nature of the statutory
relating to class actions generally and to discontinuance of claims
more specifically. It was also entirely inconsistent with senior
acceptance that there existed power to
the terms of common
questions. (Emphasis in original.)
is the trial judge’s power to amend the common questions in issue in this
case. As said in
Ethicon Sàrl v Grill
at [56] (Jagot, Murphy and
Lee JJ) in relation to
Federal Court of Australia Act 1976
(Cth) which is, relevantly, in similar terms to
Civil Procedure
A routine misconception is that the common questions specified in the
originating application or supporting documentation define
the common questions
for the balance of the proceeding. This cannot be the case. For one thing,
issues which are common may narrow
considerably upon a joinder of issue by way
of pleadings. Similarly, issues which are common to the claims may arise by way
positive averment made in a subsequent pleading, whether it be a defence, a
reply, a rejoinder or so on. Further common issues of
fact may arise upon the
filing of lay or expert affidavit evidence.
contrast, the task of an appellate court by way of rehearing pursuant to
Supreme Court Act 1970
(NSW) is the correction of
at [22], [30]. In this case, (i) there is no challenge to
the interlocutory decision and orders of Sackar J made on 21 June 2019,
varied on 22 May 2022, identifying the common questions for determination at
trial, (ii) the appellant did not make any application
during the trial or
following delivery of the principal judgment for leave to amend the amended
statement of claim and the common
questions to include the new claims now sought
to be raised regarding GST and stamp duty, and (iii) there is no ground of
contending that the primary judge erred in not amending the common
did the appellant apply before the primary judge to set aside the final orders
made on 16 September 2021 on the ground that the
Court below “has
apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the
relevant law and that this misapprehension
cannot be attributed solely to the
neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing”:
Autodesk Inc v
Dyason (No 2)

at 303 (Mason CJ);

this Court on an appeal by way of rehearing has the same powers as the primary
judge, including concerning amendment:
Supreme Court Act
there is no occasion to consider amending the common questions following the
trial and dismissal of the proceedings. The appellant
did not make any
application for leave to amend the notice of appeal to seek such relief in
respect of a matter which the appellant
for himself and as the representative
run at trial, nor pleaded.
from the absence of a formal amendment application, no circumstances were
identified by the appellant that would justify this
Court reopening the damages
issues based on the common questions following the trial and judgment below.
That would constitute a
marked departure from the way the parties conducted the
trial with respect to the common questions. This is not a case where the
appellant for himself and on behalf of group members was not afforded an
opportunity of being heard on the common questions which
proved to be decisive
in the determination of the proceedings before the primary judge:

(a) have a propensity to explode or a risk of exploding;
(b) have a propensity to malfunction or a risk of malfunctioning on

As a result of the answer to Question 3 above, in respect of each model
of the Recalled Vehicles:
are or were they not safe to drive; and/or
if driven, do or did they expose the driver or any passengers to
unnecessary danger and harm,
attributable to their construction with at least one Takata
No. The fact that each model of the Recalled Vehicles was constructed with
at least one Takata Airbag:
(a) does not make any of those Recalled Vehicles not safe to drive and does
not expose the driver or any passengers to any unnecessary
danger or harm;
(b) did not in the past make any of those Recalled Vehicles not safe to
drive and did not expose the driver or any passengers to any
unnecessary danger
Was any Recalled Vehicle acquired by a Group Member not of merchantable
quality within the meaning of section 74D of the TPA at the
time of supply to
the Group Member by reason of the answers to Questions 3 to 5?
No. By reason of the answers to questions 3 to 4, the Recalled Vehicles
acquired by Group Members were of merchantable quality within
the meaning of
section 74D of the TPA at the time of supply to each Group Member.
Whether a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the state and
condition of the Recalled Vehicles at the time of supply would not
Recalled Vehicles as:
acceptably fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are
commonly supplied?
free from defects?
for the purposes of
of the ACL.
No. Given the answers to Questions 3 and 4, a reasonable consumer fully
acquainted with the state and condition of the Recalled Vehicles
at the time of
supply would regard the Recalled Vehicles as:
(a) acceptably fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are
commonly supplied;
(b) free from defects; and
for the purposes of
of the ACL.
If the answer to Question 10 is “Yes”, can the Group Members
have suffered any loss of damage, in the form of a reduction
in the “true
value” of that Recalled Vehicle as at date of purchase, attributable
the Recalled Vehicle not being of merchantable quality, in
circumstances in which:
the Group Member has had the Recalled Takata Airbag in their
Recalled Vehicle replaced at no cost for the replacement; or
the Group Member is able to have the Recalled Takata Airbag in their
Recalled Vehicle replaced at no cost for the replacement?
Given the answer to question 10, it is not necessary to answer this
question. But given the answer to Questions 3, 4 and 10, Group
Members have not
suffered any loss or damage. In circumstances where the Takata Airbag in a
Recalled Vehicle has been replaced at
no cost, there is no difference between
the purchase price of the Recalled Vehicle and the “true value” of
that Recalled
Vehicle at the time of purchase.
If the answer to Question 11 is “Yes”, was any
non-compliance with
section 54(1)
of the ACL only because of any act, default or
omission of Takata Corporation (or its related entities, including TK Holdings
and not because of any act, default or omission of the Defendant?
Given the answers to Questions 3, 4 and 11, it is not necessary to answer
this question.
If the answer to Question 11 is “Yes”, can the Group Members
have suffered any loss of damage, in the form of a reduction
in the “true
value” of that Recalled Vehicle as at date of purchase, attributable to
the Recalled Vehicle not being of
acceptable quality, in circumstances in
the Group Member has had the Recalled Takata Airbag in their
Recalled Vehicle replaced at no cost for the replacement; or
the Group Member is able to have the Recalled Takata Airbag in their
Recalled Vehicle replaced at no cost for the replacement?
Given the answer to question 11 it is not necessary to answer this
question. But given the answers to Questions 3, 4 and 11, Group
Members have not
suffered any loss or damage. In circumstances where the Takata Airbag in a
Recalled Vehicle has been replaced at
no cost, there is no difference between
the purchase price of the Recalled Vehicle and the “true value” of
that Recalled
Vehicle at the time of purchase.
Can the Group Members have suffered any loss or damage, in the form of
disappointment, distress and / or anxiety, attributable:
If the answer to question 10 is yes, to the Recalled Vehicle not
being of merchantable quality;
If the answer to question 11 is yes, to their Recalled Vehicle not
being of acceptable quality;
If the answer to question 15 is yes, to the misleading or deceptive
conduct of the defendant;
in circumstances in which:
the Group Member has had the Recalled Takata Airbag in their
Recalled Vehicle replaced at no cost for the replacement; or
the Group Member is able to have the Recalled Takata Airbag in their
Recalled Vehicle replaced at no cost for the replacement?
No. Given the answers to Questions 3, 4, 10, 11, 14 and 15, it is not
possible for any Group Members to have suffered any loss or
damage of the kind
described in this question.
