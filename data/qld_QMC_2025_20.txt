Defendant – No appearance
REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] The applicant plaintiff seeks a substituted service
order pursuant to r 116 of the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld) (UCPR).
[2] The applicant seeks to proceed ex parte, that is without the application
being served, which is obviously understandable in light
of the relief sought.
[3] The application seeks a decision without oral hearing pursuant to r 489.
[4] The applicant has complied with the requirements of r 490 UCPR including
attaching a notice in the approved form and accompanying
the application with a
draft order and written submissions in support.
[5] His honour Judge Porter
KC DCJ has again recently reminded solicitors and the court of the need to
properly prepare and consider
applications of this kind.
[6] In Lumi Finance
Pty Ltd v Porrent
[2025] QDC 67
His Honour, in refusing an application for
substituted service said –
[7] Substituted
service applications are ex parte applications made to a Court. They should be
properly prepared having regard to
the law of substituted service and the law of
evidence on interlocutory applications. This application failed on both counts.
[8] I dismiss the application. To be clear, no order as to costs has been made,
so there is no entitlement to costs of this application
in the plaintiff.
[9] Finally, I want to emphasise that it is not the purpose of this judgement to
embarrass. Substituted service applications are
frequently done poorly, and
sometimes by practitioners who should know better. Rather, it is hoped this
judgement will lead to a
better appreciation by those involved in this
application of what is required in properly bringing such an application.
[7] These comments are apposite to the current application. The hopes expressed
by His Honour Judge Porter in the final paragraph
of his decision, have alas not
been realised in the approach taken by the applicant’s solicitor, for the
reasons that follow.
PREVIOUS APPLICATION
[8] This is in fact the second
attempt by the plaintiff to obtain an order for substituted service.
plaintiff has filed an application on 11 October 2024 (an application sought
also to be decided without oral hearing).
[10] That application was
supported by –
- Affidavit of Lina Rahim filed 11 October 2024.
- Affidavit of Mathew Winley (as to attempted service) filed on 16 August
[11] That application was considered by Magistrate Cameron McKenzie
who made orders on 14 January 2025 that ‘the application
for substituted
service is dismissed with no order as to costs.’
[12] His Honour did
not give reasons for that decision. The reasons, to the extent they are capable
of being considered such were,
in their totality, in these terms –
consider the affidavit of Ms Rahim in support of the application for substituted
service and am not satisfied it provides for a
means by which the claim and
statement of claim will come to the attention of the defendant.
is an obligation on courts when deciding matters, including applications without
oral hearing, to give adequate reasons.
A long line of authorities speak to the
need to give adequate reasons.
[14] That requirement that reasons be given
was, in my respectful opinion, well expressed by McHugh JA in the following
Soulemzis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd
[1987] 10 NSWLR 247
When parties submit their dispute to a tribunal for adjudication, they do so
on the assumption that the dispute will be decided in
accordance with rules.
They assume that the adjudicator will decide the dispute according to the rules
or principles which governed
their conduct and that he will ascertain, so far as
he reasonably can, what are the facts of the dispute. To give effect to these
assumptions a judicial decision must be a reasoned decision arrived at by
finding the relevant facts and then applying the relevant
rules or principles. A
decision which is made arbitrarily cannot be a judicial decision; for the
hallmark of a judicial decision
is the quality of rationality: cf Lord Denning,
Freedom Under the Law (1949) at 91. However, without the articulation of
a judicial decision cannot be distinguished from an arbitrary decision.
In my opinion the giving of reasons is correctly perceived
as ‘a necessary
incident of the judicial process’ because it enables the basis of the
decision to be seen and understood
both for the instant case and for the future
discretion of the law.
[15] In expressing the rationale underlying the
statutory duty to give reasons, adopting the language used by Woodward J in
Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Wraith [1983] FCA 187; 48 ALR
500 with reference to the unsuccessful party who is appraised
of the reasons
Even though I may not agree with it, I now understand why the
decision went against me. I am now in a position to decide whether that
has involved an unwarranted finding of fact, or an error or law which is worth
challenging.
[16] The Full Court in Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration
and Ethnic Affairs
[1996] FCA 182
referred with approval to observations of Sheppard J in Cth v Pharmacy Guild of
[1989] 91 ALR 65.
There, Shephard J said –
A purpose of
requiring reasons is to enable the question whether legal error has been made by
the tribunal to be more readily perceived
than otherwise might be the case. But
that is not the only important purpose which the furnishing of reasons has. A
prime purpose
is the disclosure of the tribunal’s reasoning process to the
public and the parties. The provision of reasons engenders confidence
community that the tribunal has gone about its task appropriately and fairly.
The statement of bare conclusions without the
statement of reasons will always
expose the tribunal to the suggestion that it has not given the matter close
enough attention or
that it has allowed extraneous matters to cloud its
consideration...
[17] The reasons for dismissing the plaintiff’s
application on 14 January 2025 do not assist in ascertaining the basis for the
refusal and ,when considering this second application, to assist to discern what
in fact has changed.
SUBSTITUTED SERVICE
[18] The application is
pursuant to r 116 UCPR which provides:
1) If, for any reason, it is
impracticable to serve a document in a way required under this chapter, the
court may make an order substituting
another way of serving the document.
2) The court may, in the order, specify the steps to be taken, instead of
service, for bringing the document to the attention of the
person to be served.
3) The court may, in the order, specify that the document is to be taken to
have been served on the happening of a specified event
or at the end of a
specified time.
4) The court may make an order under this rule even though
the person to be served is not in Queensland or was not in Queensland when
proceeding started.
[19] The threshold question is that the applicant
demonstrate that it is impractical to personally serve the proceedings on the
[20] That test has been described in these terms –
Furthermore the question is not whether reasonable effort has been shown by
the plaintiff over a particular period but whether at
the date on which the
application for substituted service is made the plaintiff, using reasonable
effort, is unable to serve the
personally.
[21] Once the threshold
question is established, the courts discretion under r 116(2) is enlivened. The
discretion must be informed
by the purpose of substituted service which is to
bring the proceedings to the attention of the other parties. Substituted service
is not a way to meet the formal requirements of service without affecting actual
notice of the proceedings. If a party cannot be
found, or if no reliable form of
communication of the documents to the defendant is established, then the
proceedings cannot progress.
must be a high degree of probability proved on the evidence that the proceedings
will come to the attention of the other
party by method of substituted service
It is not proper to substitute service of process in a court of law
when there is no belief that the service will bring the proceedings
knowledge of the person in question or any person representing his
ADMISSIBLE HEARSAY –
provides as follows –
1) Except if these rules
provide otherwise, an affidavit must be confined to the evidence the signatory
for the affidavit could give
if giving evidence orally.
2) However, an
affidavit for use in an application because of default or otherwise for relief,
other than final relief, may contain
statements based on information and belief
if the signatory for the affidavit states the sources of the information and the
for the belief.
[24] The requirements of the rule are –
i) The source of the statement must be able to give admissible original
evidence of the fact asserted.
ii) The deponent must sufficiently identify
the source of the statement.
iii) The deponent must state their belief in
the statement.
[25] In respect of the affidavit of Ms Hodgson, key parts of
the evidence relied upon on this application are inadmissible including
basis that –
- The deponent fails to properly identify the source of
much of his evidence.
- Either because the source is not properly identified
or even allowing for identity of the source, the evidence appears to be hearsay
from that source.
THE APPLICANT’S EVIDENCE
[26] The applicant has
filed and relies upon the following affidavit –
- Ms Sarah Hodgson
filed 15 July 2025
[27] The plaintiff’s submission (also filed 15 July
2025) seeks to identify the material read (to be relied on) as ‘Affidavit
in support (form 46).’ It does not identify the deponent nor a filing
date. I presume this to be a reference to the affidavit
of Ms Hodgson above.
[28] The affidavit of Ms Hodgson purports to rely on evidence in this
substituted service application which has been given on an information
belief basis (that is evidence comprising admissible hearsay evidence from the
[29] There are no affidavits as to attempted service.
Hodgson does not evince any evidence of an address for service for the
defendant. In paragraph 2 of her affidavit, she purports
to set out the source
of knowledge, outside her personal knowledge. However, paragraphs 3 and 4 do not
comply with the requirements
of r 430(2). In paragraph 5, she deposes to
‘primus law’ calling the defendant and conducting an
for the belief are not identified. Whatever a ‘CASPAR search’
not identified. The deponent purports to rely on and include a report and on the
face of that document it is unclear how it
is admissible for the truth of its
Rule 430(2)
UCPR permits such evidence to be adduced but only
if certain requirements pursuant to the rule are met.
[32] Indeed, Ms
Hodgson’s affidavit is in effect, evidence of nothing.
Hodgson, it appears, seeks to refer to prior attempts at personal service upon
the defendant by annexing the earlier and same
affidavit of Mr Winley.
Paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b) are inadmissible. A deponent cannot annex an affidavit
of another to seek to prove
a fact. There is also not, even taking the
plaintiff’s position at its highest, any recent evidence demonstrating an
to personally serve the defendant. The attempts of Mr Winley were now
more than one year ago. There is not any admissible evidence
to establish that
it is impracticable to personally serve the defendant.
[34] As Wilson J said
in Kendall v Sweeny & Ors
[2002] QSC 404
may well be that the method of service proposed would be effective in bringing
the proceeding to the attention of those respondents.
However, that is not
enough to justify the making of an order for substituted service. It must first
be shown that it is impracticable
to serve the documents in a way required by
chapter 4 of the UCPR. This has not been shown – indeed, there does not
to have been any attempts to serve the respondents in the usual way. In
these circumstances I refuse to make orders for substituted
[11] The interlocutory application is dismissed. There is no reason why costs
ought not follow the event.
[35] There is no admissible evidence in the affidavits relied upon by the
applicant to satisfy the threshold condition, that is that
the applicant can
demonstrate that it is impracticable to personally serve the proceedings on the
[36] The application for substituted service must therefore fail
and is dismissed.
[37] There is no order as to costs.
[38] This is now
the second failed attempt by the plaintiff’s solicitors to obtain an order
for substituted service. By publishing
what are hopefully adequate reasons on
this occasion, the wish expressed by Porter KC DCJ above that ‘it is hoped
this judgement
will lead to a better appreciation by those involved in this
application of what is required in properly bringing such an application’
will be achieved, such that any further such application will enliven the proper
exercise of the court’s discretion.
