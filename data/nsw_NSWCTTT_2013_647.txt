REASONS FOR DECISION
APPLICATION
is an application by the landlord pursuant for payment of money or compensation
by the tenant at the end of the tenancy for breach
of the agreement by failing
to return the premises in good order, fair wear and tear

amount in dispute is within the monetary jurisdiction set out in the
Residential
Tenancies Regulation 2010
(RTR) r 23 of $30,000.00 for a rental bond and

am satisfied on the evidence that there was a residential tenancy agreement, the
premises are residential premises, a Rental Bond
was paid, and the application
is brought within time.
relevant facts are:
parties entered into a residential tenancy agreement dated 1 February 2011 for a
fixed term of 12 months (the Agreement) with
a rent of $650.00 per week for
premises in a secured strata building;
Agreement was in the standard form set out in the Regulations Schedule
was an ingoing and outgoing condition report completed. A reconciliation of
those reports shows a discrepancy at the end of
the tenancy (summarised):
premises dirty, carpets dirty, walls scratched and marked;
tenant had paid rent up to and including 18 February 2013;
tenant was evicted by the Sheriff on 19 February 2013 (owing one day’s
landlord has had the works completed to put the premises back into good repair
and tendered invoices to prove the cost. The landlord
also claims for other
matters such as arrears of rent, loss of rent, hearing fees, sheriff fees and
break fees;
landlord has received the whole of the Bond monies including interest in the sum
of $ 2,320.50.
landlord carries the burden of proving the claims.
tenant has an obligation to put the premises in repair at the expiration or
sooner determination of the term: see RTR Schedule
1 (Standard Form Agreement)
clause 17 (concerning the tenant’s obligations at end of tenancy
agreement), and McGregor on Damages
ed Sweet & Maxwell
London 1988 at [990]. The failure of the tenant to do so is a breach of the
tenant’s covenant which
gives the landlord a remedy in damages: see RTA s
166 (Matters that may be subject of rental bond claim) and s 187(1)(c) and
of a claim by the landlord requires proof of a loss and a discharge of the
landlord's obligation to mitigate (or reduce) his
loss and damage by reasonable
conduct: see RTR Schedule 1 (Standard Form Agreement) clause 36 (Mitigation of
the case of rent arrears the landlord proves the claim by the rent ledger, which
in this matter shows that the rent was paid up
to 18 February 2013, leaving one
day unpaid including the date of eviction. The claim of $8,288.16 is dismissed
and the landlord
is allowed one day at $87.14.
landlord claimed loss of rent for 28 days being from 20 February 2013 to 19
March 2013 (the date of the new tenancy agreement)
in the sum of $2,527.15,
which should have been $2,439.92. In any case the claim for either amount is
dismissed as the tenancy was
brought to an end by the Tribunal’s order on
the landlord’s application for termination and does not arise because
was no unexpired fixed term, and the tenant has not abandoned the premises
(RTA s 107). In addition, the landlords have not proved
that all reasonable
steps were taken to rent the premises and that the 28 days loss of rent was as a
consequence of the tenant’s
conduct. In this regard I also note that the
landlords recovered the premises on 20 February 2013 but did not complete the
wall repairs
and repainting until sometime later as the tax invoice (exhibit B)
is dated 29 May 2013.
landlord claimed a break fee consisting of rent (the agent’s commission)
of $715.00, advertising fee of $100.00 and preparation
fee for new agreement of
$33.00. These claims are dismissed as they are claims for amounts which in due
course the landlord would
have had to pay the managing agent, and these amounts
have been brought forward for payment rather than being additional
the case of a breach of the obligation to return the premises in good order and
condition (fair wear and tear excepted) the landlord
may make claims, under RTA
s 166(1)(a),(c),(d) and (e) for the reasonable cost of:
(a) repairs to or restoration of the premises and good leased with the
premises as a result of damage cause by the tenant, occupants
and invitees;
(c) cleaning, having regard to the ingoing condition report;
(d) replacing locks and other security devices altered, removed or added by
the tenant without the landlord’s consent;
and RTA s 166(2) any other claims under the Agreement.
landlord proves his claims by a reconciliation of the Ingoing Condition Report
(ICR) and the Outgoing Condition Report (OCR),
and proof of the monetary claim
for that loss and damage subject to reasonable efforts to mitigate the loss
(Standard Form clause
36), allowing depreciation of the goods damaged in
accordance with the depreciation rates allowed by the Australian Taxation
McGregor at [1001] to [1003] sets out the common law rule as
“...such a sum as will put the premises into the state of repair in
which the tenant was bound to leave them”
and cites the authorities at
fn s 83 and 84. McGregor at [1002] refers to the cost of repairs as including
allowance for loss of
rent or occupation during the repair and some deduction
where there is a substitution of new for old, which is another way of referring
to an allowance for depreciation.
of the landlords’ claims were evidenced by lump sum tax invoices
describing the work in a general way, which were not transparent
and did not
itemise the value of materials used up in the work, the hours the work took or
the hourly rate. These did not satisfy
the landlord's obligation to mitigate his
loss. They do not establish that the cost claimed was reasonable or that the
not have been done for less.
cleaning fees were itemised into three claims, the rubbish removal was conceded
by the tenant $40.00; the cleaning cost of $280.00
which is allowed; and steam
cleaning ‘all carpet’ at $120.00. Steam cleaning does not allow for
fair wear and tear over
the two years (or thereabouts) of the tenancy. The
tenant’s evidence was that he regularly vacuumed the carpets. There was
special condition requiring steam cleaning at the end of the tenancy. This claim
is dismissed as the steam cleaning is to return
the carpet into the same
condition as at the commencement of the tenancy.
landlord claimed $1,000.00 for supply and install carpets “throughout the
bedroom in downstairs and stairs”. There
is no mention in the outgoing
condition report (OCR) of damage to the carpet on the stairs and this part of
the claim fails. The
OCR identifies a burn mark in the bedroom carpet, which is
partially allowed on the basis of $1,000.00 depreciated 20% (2 years)
then allowed 50% at $400. The other $400 is apportioned to the unsuccessful
claim for the carpet on the stairs.
patching and painting claim is for $2,860.00. This shows a lump sum charged for
various rooms, and includes claims for work which
is not identified in the OCR:
skirting boards, and hallway. The claim for the lounge at $1,000.00 was to
repair a scratch on the
wall of about 0.5 m. This is an excessive amount for
patching and repainting. Similarly for the walls in the bedrooms. The wall
was relatively new (about 2 years) and the repainting could have been to the
repaired portion of the wall and ‘feathered
in’ so it was not
noticeable. The practice of developers in recent years is to provide the owner
with details of the paint
brand, colour and finish type to enable repainting. If
the landlord wished to repaint the whole wall or all the walls in the rooms,
which appears to have been what has happened, that is a claim which is not
proved. The repainting of the kitchen wall was along a
bench near the oven top.
It is well know that walls in this location should be tiled as the paint is
otherwise subject to food splashing
and marks which is fair wear and tear. The
amounts allowed are lounge room $300.00, bedroom 1 $500.00, bedroom 2 $300.00
and stairway
rail $100.00; total
landlord claimed $330.00 as the cost of replacing the locks after eviction of
the tenant. This was not a claim arising from the
tenant’s unauthorised
change of the locks: see RTA s 166(1)(d). The evidence is that the strata
building is a secured building
which requires an electronic access card. The
landlord could have changed the access code and the cost of changing the locks
unnecessary. This claim is dismissed.
were claims for the Tribunal filing fee of $74.00 and the Sheriff’s fees
of $307.00. The filing fee claim is dismissed
as this is a cost of the
proceedings which is not recoverable unless there are special circumstances
proved. There are no special
circumstances. The Sheriff’s fees are a cost
of enforcing the Tribunal’s orders and are not recoverable. Both claims
are dismissed.
find on the facts that the applicant is entitled to the above Order for payment
of $313.36 (bond received $2,320.50 less claims
$2,007.14).
