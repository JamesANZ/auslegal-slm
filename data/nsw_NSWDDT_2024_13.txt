Introduction
16 October 2024 judgment was delivered on the plaintiff’s application for
leave to commence and continue proceedings against
the first defendant Coal
Mines Insurance Limited (CMI) in relation to claims arising from the employment
of the plaintiff by deregistered
companies –
Franklin v Coal Mines
Insurance Limited & Ors
[2024] NSWDDT 11
(the primary judgment).
requested by the parties, I reserved the costs of the plaintiff’s
application for leave to proceed against CMI. This judgment
concerns the costs
of the application.
plaintiff filed two further affidavits:
(1) Affidavit of J Wade dated 9 October 2024 (PX 12).
(2) Affidavit of J Wade dated 23 October 2024 (PX 13).
filed an affidavit of R Brewster dated 6 November 2024 (DX 2).
following written submissions on costs were filed:
(1) Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 23 October 2024 (MFI 14).
(2) CMI written submissions dated 6 November 2024 (MFI 15).
affidavits of Ms Wade set out the history of correspondence between the parties,
much of which was directed towards requiring
CMI to produce copies of insurance
policies issued to the deregistered companies, or correspondence concerning
insurance so issued.
The affidavit of Ms Brewster set out the procedural history
of the matter.
summary, the hearing of the Motion proceeded in a piecemeal fashion, with the
plaintiff requesting further documents from CMI,
and CMI producing further
documents from time to time.
end result of this protracted process was that the plaintiff was able to
establish that there was a CMI policy in force on the
alleged last date of
employment with all of the deregistered companies except Alminco – primary
judgment at [70].
need for the plaintiff to serve several Notices to Produce upon CMI, which
resulted in fragmentary production of insurance related
documents, was most
unfortunate. On 7 June 2024 a lawyer for CMI swore an affidavit (PX 6) setting
out, on her instructions, the
polices of insurance which had been issued by CMI
to certain of the deregistered companies. In the end the plaintiff established
more extensive insurance than was contained in the CMI lawyer’s
Submissions for the Plaintiff
plaintiff relied upon the following chronology of events:
(1) Ms Wade wrote to CMI on 6 June 2022 and 7 March 2023 seeking information
regarding the existence of relevant insurance policies
in respect of the
deregistered employers. CMI did not respond to these requests.
(2) On 16 March 2023 the plaintiff filed his Motion seeking leave to proceed
against CMI.
(3) On 2 May 2023 the solicitor for CMI wrote to Ms Wade stating that CMI did
not concede that it was the workers compensation insurer
for the deregistered
employers. The letter requested that the Motion be withdrawn.
(4) On 13 November 2023 Ms Wade wrote to the solicitors for CMI requesting the
same information she had requested a year earlier.
No response was ever
(5) On 5 February 2024 the solicitors for CMI sent an email to Ms Wade providing
details of some CMI policies. Those details were
ultimately found to be
incomplete. No documents were provided. This incomplete information was the same
as that set out in the affidavit
of the lawyer for CMI (PX 6).
(6) Ms Wade then served three Notices to Produce on 12 June 2024, 5 July 2024
and 31 July 2024 in order to obtain further insurance
documents from CMI.
Production was given “in a piecemeal fashion of these documents”
– MFI 14 par 11.
(7) The documents which were produced disproved the assertion made by CMI and
its lawyers that there was no policy in respect of
the deregistered employers
Colrok, Allied Mining and Allied Mining Services. There was never any
explanation provided for the disconnect
between the denial of insurance for
these companies and the discovery, because of the diligence of the
plaintiff’s solicitor,
that insurance cover did exist.
(8) On 21 August 2024 and 18 September 2024 Ms Wade wrote to the solicitors for
CMI, referring to the documents produced, and asked
CMI to admit that it was on
risk for all of the deregistered employers other than Alminco. No responses were
ever sent to Ms Wade.
for the plaintiff submitted that while the plaintiff was required to file the
Motion seeking leave, the approach of CMI, summarised
in the correspondence
annexed to the affidavit of Ms Wade (PX 12), meant that the plaintiff was put to
the time and expense of obtaining
documents by a lengthy process, when such
documents should have been produced by an insurer at a very early stage of the
proceedings.
for the plaintiff submitted that it would not be just to make an order that the
costs of the Motion be costs in the cause,
and that the appropriate order was
for costs to follow the event, so that CMI was ordered to pay the
plaintiff’s costs of and
incidental to the application for leave to
Submissions for CMI
for CMI submitted that costs of the plaintiff’s Motion should be reserved
until after the proceedings against CMI was
determined. I reject that
submission. I have all of the evidence I need to deal with costs now, not later.
In the alternative, CMI
submitted that an order should be made that costs of the
application be costs in the cause.
submitted as follows:
(1) There are still active issues to be determined on a final hearing, including
whether the plaintiff was employed by the deregistered
employers as alleged, the
periods of any such employment and whether or not any policy issued by CMI
responds to the plaintiff’s
(2) The plaintiff has amended his proceedings from time to time, culminating in
a Second Further Amended Statement of Claim filed
on 22 August 2024. This
amended pleading now makes allegations by reference to policy documents which
the plaintiff obtained under
Notices to Produce. Amendments to the Notice of
Motion were made during the hearing of the application.
(3) If any of the allegations made as to the plaintiff’s employment with
any of the deregistered corporations are not made
out, then the plaintiff will
have obtained the relief granted in the primary judgment on an incorrect
Consideration
Applications
for leave to sue the insurer of a deregistered corporate employer are common in
the Dust Diseases Tribunal. Such applications
are usually made in claims for
asbestos-related diseases. Workers compensation insurers regularly and promptly
produce evidence of
the existence of a policy, thus expediting urgent claims
made for dying plaintiffs.
relating to coal mine dust lung diseases are appearing more and more frequently
in the Monday Dust Lists. CMI has been the
monopoly insurer of NSW coal mines
since 1948. It is disappointing that CMI was not able to give firm and timely
answers to reasonable
requests made by the plaintiff’s solicitors to
confirm insurance coverage for the deregistered employers. This case
demonstrates
that CMI needs a much better system to record the past issuance of
coal mines insurance, and to provide prompt and accurate responses
raise by solicitors acting for claimants with coal mine dust lung diseases.
CMI submits, the entitlement to a grant of leave does not equate to a finding
that the plaintiff will succeed against CMI in relation
to his alleged periods
of employment with deregistered employers. They are matters which will have to
be proved by the plaintiff
on a final hearing.
there is no doubt that the plaintiff has been put to considerable and
unnecessary expense in issuing Notices to Produce,
obtaining documents pursuant
to those Notices, and analysing and tendering those documents for the purpose of
the application for
leave to proceed against CMI. In my view CMI should have
been able to provide that information long ago.
am of the view that the appropriate order for costs in relation to the
application made by the plaintiff is that CMI should pay
the costs of the
order of the Tribunal is:
(1) Order that the first defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of and
incidental to the plaintiff’s application for leave
to proceed against the
first defendant.
