REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 24 January 2025)
[1] These are
three separate proceedings variously before the Court of Appeal and the Full
Court which have been heard together because
they involve facts, issues and
questions in common.
principal matter (AP 13/22 (2237775)) is an appeal from a decision of the
Supreme Court delivered on 10 November
That decision, and the
grounds of appeal, involve the application of
Residential
Tenancies Act 1999
) to the appellants’ tenancy
agreements; and the operation of
Housing Act 1982
Housing Act
of the RTA concerning rent
increases for those tenancies. The principal question is whether three
Determinations of Rent Payable
for Dwellings made in purported pursuance of
Housing Act
on 23 December 2021, 29 April 2022 and
2 September 2022 were made beyond or outside the power conferred by the
[3] The second
matter (2023-01110-SC) is an adjunct to the appeal in the first matter. In its
original form, it is an application
for judicial review seeking, amongst other
relief, a declaration that a fourth Determination of Rent Payable for Dwellings
1 February 2023 made in purported pursuance of
ultra vires
by operation of
of the RTA and
cl 2(2) of Sch 2 of the
Residential Tenancies Regulations 2000
RT Regulations
). In essence, this is a challenge to the
validity of a fourth Determination made after the delivery of the decision of
the Supreme
Court which is presently the subject of appeal in the principal
matter. The clear purpose of the challenge is to ensure that any
decision on
appeal is not rendered nugatory by the continuing operation of the Determination
subsequently made. By consent, that
particular claim for relief was referred for
determination to the Full Court, to be heard together with the other
[4] The third
matter (2023-01346-SC) is in its original form an application for leave to
appeal from a decision of the Northern Territory
Civil and Administrative
) made on 29 March 2023. The substance of the
decision is that NTCAT lacks jurisdiction to determine applications made by the
(as tenants) for declarations under s 42 of the RTA. By consent,
that question was referred for determination to the Full Court,
to be heard
together with the other matters.
Factual and statutory
[5] The four
appellants/plaintiffs/applicants (referred to in these Reasons as
) are tenants in public housing in remote communities in the
Northern Territory. Due to changes in the Administrative Arrangements
the relevant period, the four Determinations in question in these proceedings
were made variously by the Minister for
Territory Families and Urban Housing and
the Minister for Housing and Homelands (referred to in these Reasons as
responsible Minister
23 December 2021, the responsible Minister made a Determination under
Housing Act
that affected the mechanism by which rent
payable by the appellants was to be assessed, and, ultimately, the amount of
payable by the appellants with respect to their various leased
the First Determination
responsible Minister then made a Determination in similar terms on 27 April 2022
which revoked part of the First Determination
the Second Determination
September 2022, the responsible Minister made a further Determination in similar
terms to that made on 27 April 2022, but
revoking part of the Second
Determination (
the Third Determination

the Second and Third Determinations postponed the commencement date for the new
rent from that set in each of the
earlier Determinations. (The First, Second and
Third Determinations are referred to collectively in these Reasons as
Determinations
appellants brought an application for judicial review seeking the following
declaration of right pursuant to
section 18(1)
Supreme Court Act
(a) the three Determinations do not give rise to an increase in the
plaintiffs’ rent having regard to
Residential
Tenancies Act 1999
(NT) (the RTA) (the first declaration); and
(b) any rent increase by way of an increase in the percentage of the
plaintiff’s income is unlawful having regard to
of the RTA (the
second declaration).
declaration of right pursuant to
section 18(1)
Supreme Court Act
(NT) that the plaintiffs as tenants of “public housing
premises” as defined in
Housing Act 1982
Housing Act
) can seek a declaration that the rent payable under their tenancy
agreement is excessive under
of the RTA because such agreements are
not a “tenancy under the
Housing Act
” as defined in
order quashing those parts of the three Determinations which give rise to rent
increases because of a failure to afford procedural
fairness and for legal
unreasonableness.
[11] The general
factual background to the matter is not in dispute. That background is
conveniently set out in the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the following terms
(subject to a number of assertions of factual error which are dealt with in the
course of these
It is accepted that each of the plaintiffs
occupy residential dwellings in a remote community pursuant to a lease which
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) (the CEOH) as the landlord. The
first and second plaintiffs jointly lease residential premises
in Gunbalanya
(also known as Oenpelli). The third plaintiff leases different residential
premises in Gunbalayna. The fourth plaintiff
leases residential premises in
The written lease signed by the first and second plaintiffs does not specify
within the document the rent that is payable. A clause
Remote Public
Housing Tenancy Rules
[clause 5.1], which purported to be part of the terms
of the lease, gave the CEOH, as landlord, the right “to vary the Rent
time to time in accordance with any determination made pursuant to
Housing Act
”. As the copy of the lease before the Court has not
been executed by or on behalf of the CEOH, the first and second plaintiffs
submitted that the terms of the lease are the default terms set out in Schedule
Residential Tenancies Regulations 2000
Residential
Tenancies Act
(RTA),[s 19(4)]). The default terms do not contain a
clause equivalent to clause 5.1. Nothing turns upon this point. The only
of clause 5.1 is as demonstrating that the first and second plaintiffs
were on notice that determinations made by the Minister under
Housing Act
may result in an increase in base rent for the premises they
were occupying.
A similar situation existed with regard to the lease signed by the third
The lease signed by the fourth plaintiff specified the rent payable as
$140.00 per week, but included a note to the effect that “the
subject to adjustment in accordance with
Housing Act
(NT).” The terms of the fourth plaintiff’s lease are ...
identical to the default terms.
The provisions of the
Housing Act
govern aspects of the provision of
public housing in the Northern Territory. The
Housing Act
establishes an
entity by the name of the CEOH. This entity is a body corporate sole and is
capable, in its corporate name, of acquiring,
holding and disposing of real,
leasehold and personal property [the
Housing Act
The CEOH has
power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done for or in
connection with or incidental to the performance
of its functions in the
exercise of its powers [the
Housing Act
The CEOH is,
however, subject to Ministerial direction [the
Housing Act
One of the functions of the CEOH is to provide, and to assist in the
provision of, residential accommodation [the
Housing Act
To that end, and without limiting the generality of
, in carrying
out its functions the CEOH may let premises and may acquire, hold and dispose of
real property, or any interest therein.
A dwelling for the purposes of the
Housing Act
means a house acquired
and retained by the CEOH.
Housing Act
addresses the
rent payable for dwellings to which the
Housing Act
applies. The section
Rent payable for dwellings
(1) The Minister may, from time to time, by
notice determine
the rent to be paid for a dwelling or a class of dwelling.
(2) A determination under this section may be subject to conditions that the
Minister thinks fit.
(3) A determination under this section is to specify the date on which the
rent will become payable for the dwelling or the class
of dwelling.
(4) The rent to be paid for a dwelling is the rent determined from time to
time under subsection (1) and the rent is to be paid despite
anything to the
contrary contained in the tenancy agreement entered into in respect of the
dwelling or in any arrangement or agreement,
or alleged arrangement or
agreement, between the tenant of the dwelling and any other person (including
the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing), the former Commission, the Territory or
their employees or agents).
It is apparent from the provisions of
that the base rent payable
for occupation of remote dwellings falling within a class of dwellings to which
a determination under
that section applies is not set by agreement between the
parties as recorded in the lease agreement. It is set by statute as the
determined from time to time by the Minister ... [base rent]. The base rent is
not necessarily the rent paid by a tenant,
as there exists a rebate system which
permits a rebated rent to be charged based on household income. The claim now
made by the plaintiffs
is that any rent increase, either in base rent or rebated
rent, is only permissible if the provisions of the RTA are satisfied, and
particular, that the provisions of
of the RTA are satisfied. I will
the basis on which
the CEOH held an interest in each of the dwellings so as to
be able to lease the dwellings to the plaintiff.
In an affidavit made on 22 August 2022, Brent Aaron Warren, the Deputy Chief
Executive of Housing Operations in the Department of
Territory Families, Housing
and Communities stated:
townsite of Gunbalanya lies within Northern Territory Portion 1646 (NT 1646), as
identified in Survey Plan CP 004181;
and 699, Town of Gunbalanya, where the first, second, and third plaintiffs
reside, are contained within NT 1646;
is Aboriginal land within the meaning of
section 3(1)
Aboriginal Land
Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976
(Cth) (ALRA). The Arnhem Land
Aboriginal Trust holds an estate in fee simple over NT Portion 1646;
August 2009, the Arnhem Land Aboriginal Trust, Northern Land Council, CEOH and
the Commonwealth of Australia entered
into an agreement through which the Arnhem
Land Aboriginal Trust granted to the CEOH a lease under
of the ALRA
(the Gunbalaya lease); and
Gunbalaya lease remains in force.
... [T]he parties agree that the
residential dwelling occupied by the first and second plaintiffs, and that
occupied by the third
plaintiff, are premises that were part of the land leased
to the CEOH by the Gunbalaya lease.
In the same affidavit, Mr Warren stated:
is an Aboriginal community living area which was excised from the Napperby
pastoral lease in 1992 under
Pastoral Land Act 1992
(NT). It comprises NT Portion 4069 over which the Laramba Community Incorporated
(LCI) holds an estate in fee simple, subject to
various statutory conditions and
restrictions which cover the use and occupation of Aboriginal community living
Town of Laramba, where the fourth plaintiff resides, is situated within NT
Portion 4069;
July 2014, LCI, the Central Land Council and the Executive Director of Township
Leasing (the EDTL) entered into a head
lease concerning certain land in Laramba,
including Lot 51, to facilitate the provision of public housing; and
July 2018, the EDTL entered into a sublease with the CEOH to facilitate the CEOH
providing public housing in Laramba.
This sublease included the land comprising
Prior to December 2021, the Determination setting out base
rent payable for remote dwellings included a Table which specified the
payable depending upon whether the dwelling was [a] 1, 2, 3 or 4 bedroom
dwelling and whether the dwelling was classified
rebuilt”, “refurbished” or an “existing house”.
Acknowledging that tenants in public
housing were often poor, a safety net
system existed such that rent for public housing could be set at the lesser of
the base rent
determined in accordance with the Table or rent calculated based
on a percentage of household income (rebated rent). This safety
implemented as a matter of policy.
Over time, this system was considered to be inefficient, complex and
difficult to administer. As household income frequently changed
for tenants in
remote public housing, due to factors such as changes in Centrelink entitlements
and changes to the number of persons
occupying a dwelling, the rent payable by
the tenant required frequent reassessment and was subject to change. The
Northern Territory
Government determined to implement a simplified and
consistent scheme that was easy to administer, easy to understand, and
for all parties. To that end, a new framework for determining rent
for remote dwellings was developed throughout 2018. This process
included the
formation of the Stakeholder Advisory Group (the SAG), comprising
representatives from:
(a) the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency;
(b) Aboriginal Housing Northern Territory;
(c) NT Shelter;
(d) the Northern Land Council;
(e) the Central Land Council;
(f) Yili Rreung Aboriginal Housing Corporation;
(g) Kalano Community Association;
(h) the Tangentyere Council;
(i) the Central Australian Affordable Housing Company;
(j) the Julalikari Council Aboriginal Corporation;
(k) Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory;
(l) North Australian Aboriginal Family Legal Service; and
(m) Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory.
The SAG considered a number of different methodologies for determining base
rent for remote dwellings. A record of the meeting of
the SAG on 9 November 2018
reveals that all members of the SAG agreed that the operational cost per bedroom
model was the best model.
This model was approved by Cabinet in December 2021.
The model approved by Cabinet provided for base rent for a remote public housing
dwelling to be determined based on the number of the bedrooms the dwelling
contains and to be set accordingly by the Minister pursuant
Housing Act
. The model approved by Cabinet contained a safety net by way
of a policy allowing the CEOH to only charge a portion of the full rent
by a tenant on a temporary basis, if the tenant would encounter rental stress
due to being required to pay the full rent
payable pursuant to the
Determination. The government policy is for the CEOH to require such tenants to
pay an amount equivalent
to 25% of the total household income of the relevant
dwelling, initially for up to 6
[12] It was
against that background that the responsible Minister made the three
Determinations which were the subject of the original
application for judicial

Determinations were purportedly made, is extracted in that part of the judgment

of the RTA, the
operation of which the appellants say precluded the rent increases effected by
the three Determinations, provides:
Increases in rent
(1) A landlord may increase the rent payable under a tenancy agreement only
(a) the right to increase the rent; and
(b) the amount of the increase in rent or the method of calculation of the
increase in rent,
is specified in the agreement.
(2) A proposal to increase the rent payable under a tenancy agreement is of
no effect unless at least 30 days written notice is given
to the tenant of:
(a) the amount of the increase; and
(b) the date from which the increase is to take effect.
(3) The date fixed for an increase in rent in relation to a tenancy must not
be earlier than 6 months after:
(a) the day on which the tenancy agreement commences; or
(b) if there has been a previous increase of rent under this section in
relation to one or more of the same tenants and the same
premises – the
last increase.
(4) If the rent payable under a tenancy agreement is increased under this
section, the terms of the agreement are varied accordingly.
(5) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) do not apply in relation to:
(a) a provision of a tenancy agreement in relation to a tenancy under which the
rent payable changes automatically at stated intervals
on a basis set out in the
agreement or by a determination under the
Housing Act 1982
minister administering that Act; or
(b) an increase in the amount of rent payable by a tenant because of the
cancellation or adjustment of a rent rebate.
of the RTA, which the appellants say governed the form of the tenancy
agreements, relevantly provides:
Tenancy agreements to be
(1) If a landlord enters into a written tenancy agreement the agreement is
(a) contain the name of the tenants and the name and address for service of the
landlord's agent, if any;
(b) contain the full name and address for service of the landlord;
(c) clearly identify the premises to which the agreement relates;
(d) contain each term, or a term to the same effect as each term, that is
specified by or under this Act to be a term of a tenancy
(e) include terms as to the amount of rent payable and how the rent is to be
payable; and
(f) if the agreement is for a fixed term tenancy – specify the duration
of the agreement.
(4) If a tenancy agreement is not in accordance with subsection (1) or is
not signed by all parties to the agreement, a tenancy agreement,
prescribed for the purposes of this section is to be taken to be the agreement
between the parties for the purposes of this
[14] Regulation
10 of the RT Regulations provides that for the purposes of s 19(4) of the
RTA, ‘the tenancy agreement set out
in Schedule 2 is prescribed’.
Clause 2(2) of the default tenancy agreement prescribed by Sch 2 of
RT Regulations provides:
The tenant must pay, before each
rental payment period in respect of the premises to which this agreement
relates, the amount of rent,
if any, agreed at the beginning of the tenancy
between the landlord and the tenant to be payable in respect of the rental
[15] The third
declaration sought by the appellants in the original application for judicial
review was that as tenants of ‘public
housing premises’ as defined
Housing Act
they can seek a declaration that the rent
payable under their tenancy agreements is excessive under
because such agreements are not a ‘tenancy under the
’ as defined in
of the RTA.
[16] The term
‘public housing premises’ is defined in
to mean (so far as is relevant for these purposes):
(a) premises that are owned or leased by the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)
or the Territory for the purpose of being let to eligible
persons by the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing) or the Territory under a prescribed housing scheme,
whether or not the premises
have been let;
[17] The term
‘tenancy under the
Housing Act 1982
’ is defined in
of the RTA to mean:
(a) a social housing tenancy; or
(b) any other tenancy granted under the
Housing Act 1982
(i) in relation to premises that are owned or leased by the CEO (Housing) or
the Territory; or
(ii) under which the CEO (Housing) or the Territory is the landlord.
of the RTA provides:
Tribunal may declare rent excessive
(1) The Tribunal may, on the application of the tenant, declare that the
rent payable under a tenancy agreement is excessive.
(2) The Tribunal must not make a declaration under subsection (1) unless
(a) has given 14 days notice to the landlord of the application; and
(b) has invited the landlord to make submissions to the Tribunal in relation to
the application before the date specified in the

(c) has considered any submissions made by the landlord.
(3) The Tribunal may only make a declaration under subsection (1) if the
rent paid in respect of the tenancy agreement is, in the
opinion of the
Tribunal, excessive:
(a) having regard to the general level of rents for comparable premises in the
same or similar localities and the cost of any services
provided in connection
with the tenancy agreement by the landlord or the tenant; or

extent, having regard to
the cost of any services provided in connection with the tenancy agreement by
the landlord or the tenant.
(4) If the Tribunal makes a declaration under subsection (1), it may by
(a) specify the rent payable for the premises and vary the agreement by
reducing the rent payable under the agreement accordingly;
(b) specify a date (which is not to be before the date of the application) from
which the variation takes effect; and

The decision of the Supreme Court
[19] Against
that factual and statutory background, the trial judge dismissed the
appellants’ application for the declarations
[20] In relation
to the argument that
of the RTA precluded the rent increases effected
by the three Determinations, the trial judge proceeded on the assumption that
of the leases contained clauses that satisfied the requirements of
of the RTA. Even accepting that contention for the purpose of the
argument, the trial judge found that the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) was
the ‘landlord’ for that purpose, and that the landlord had not
purported to increase the rent. The term
‘landlord’ was relevantly
of the RTA to mean ‘the person who grants the right of
occupancy under a tenancy agreement’. As neither the responsible
nor the Northern Territory of Australia granted any of the appellants a right of
occupancy under a tenancy agreement, neither
was restricted by
RTA in relation to any increase in rent or the method of calculation of an
increase in rent.
[21] To the
extent that there was any apparent conflict between the responsible
Minister’s power to determine rents under
Housing Act
and the facility to fix rents at a different level under
RTA, the trial judge determined that the RTA had been later enacted and the
legislature had made a clear choice to allow the
Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) to grant a right of occupancy for tenancies under the
Housing Act
while leaving the Minister responsible for determining rents. That intention
was consistent with the obvious purpose of
of the RTA to redress
inequality of bargaining power in a market-based residential lease system, and
the inapplicability of that
mechanism to a social housing system which involves
quite different obligations and considerations. So much was also apparent from
the fact that
of the RTA, to the extent that it permits a declaration
that rent is excessive, is entirely unconcerned with the financial position
the lessee, and the fact that rent determinations under the public housing
system permitted the grant of rebates to the base rent
on the basis of financial
circumstance and need.
confinement of
of the RTA to a rent increase imposed by a
‘landlord’ also reflected the infeasibility of setting an
individualised market
rent for each of the 5000 dwellings in remote communities
which were subject to the Determinations under the
Housing Act
express grant of power in
Housing Act
determinations for ‘a class of dwelling’. In the opinion of the
trial judge, the absence of a reference in
of the RTA to
of the RTA as one of the provisions specified not to apply to a tenancy under
Housing Act
did not indicate a legislative intention that
was to apply. The inclusion of an express exemption was determined by the trial
judge to be unnecessary in a scheme under which the
rent payable for public
housing tenancies is fixed by determination under
[23] In relation
to the argument that the appellants could seek a declaration from NTCAT that the
rent payable under their tenancy
agreements was excessive under
RTA, the trial judge declined to determine that issue in circumstances where the
appellants had not at that stage sought to
invoke the jurisdiction of NTCAT in
that respect. As described at the commencement of these Reasons, the appellants
subsequently
brought an application for that purpose before NTCAT, which
determined as a preliminary issue that it lacked jurisdiction to make
declarations under
of the RTA in relation to public housing tenancies.
The application for leave to appeal against that determination forms the third
matter under consideration (2023-01346-SC) in the subject
proceedings.
[24] In relation
to the argument that the appellants were denied procedural fairness, the trial
judge adopted the respondents’
distinction between the exercise of a power
to make a decision which directly affects a person individually and that which
affects an individual as member of the public or of a class of the
That latter category of
decision includes the exercise of statutory powers to regulate prices in the
public interest, which does
not attract an entitlement to a prior hearing before
the exercise of the power.
trial judge ultimately determined that the responsible Minister was not obliged
to provide procedural fairness to the appellants
as part of a class of tenants
to whom the Determinations applied, but that even if there was such an
entitlement it was satisfied
by the consultation process undertaken through the
[25] Finally,
the trial judge rejected the argument that the Determinations were legally
unreasonable because they applied to all
public housing premises in town camps
and remote communities regardless of condition or location. That determination
was made largely
on the basis that

grounds of appeal in AP 13/22 (2237775)
appellants’ grounds of appeal may be summarised as
trial judge erred in concluding that
of the RTA did not apply to
the appellants’ tenancy agreements by concluding that:
(a) the legislature did not intend for it to apply,
(i) especially having regard to
of the RTA and
Housing Act
(ii) having regard to the trial judge’s incorrect understanding that a
determination of rent with application to the appellants
had been made prior to
the Determination dated 23 December 2021, and that there was a legal concept of
‘base rent’, when
the only relevant concept under both the RTA and
Housing Act
was ‘rent’;
(b) the responsible Minister was not the ‘landlord’ for the purposes
of the RTA in circumstances where each was either,
(i) acting as an agent of the Commonwealth pursuant to

(c) the responsible Minister was not the

trial judge erred by failing to conclude that those parts of the First, Second
and Third Determinations which gave rise to rent
increases, and/or applied to
classes of two, three and/or four bedroom dwellings, were legally unreasonable
in that each took no
account of:
(a) the extent of non-compliance by the landlord with the requirements of the
RTA in respect of each affected premises, and especially
those requirements set
of the RTA;
(b) the proximity of each affected premises to government, health and education
services, especially when compared with determinations
Housing Act
in relation to urban premises; and/or
(c) the departure of each of the First, Second and Third Determinations from the
model endorsed by the SAG consultation.
[27] The issue
of principle which the appellants say underlies the challenge to the trial
judge’s determination is that the
relevant legislation should not be
construed on the assumption that different considerations apply to private
tenants, on the one
hand, and social housing tenants of limited means, on the
other hand. The appellants say the only relevant point of distinction for
purposes is that members of the latter category of tenant are entitled to the
benefits which a public housing scheme affords
because they are at relative
disadvantage in terms of economic resource and power. Otherwise, they should
enjoy the protections of
general tenancy law equally with other categories of
tenant without any assumption of differential treatment informing the process
construction.
applicability of
appellants’ first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in
concluding that
of the RTA did not apply to the appellants’
tenancy agreements. As already described,
of the RTA provides that
a landlord may increase the rent payable under a tenancy agreement only if the
right to increase the rent
and the amount of the increase in rent or the method
of calculation of the increase in rent is specified in the agreement. The trial
judge concluded that the increases effected by the Determinations were not made
by the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) as ‘landlord’.
Rather, the
increases were effected by the Determinations made by the responsible Minister,
who was an entity quite separate from
the ‘landlord’ as relevantly
of the RTA to mean relevantly ‘the person who grants
the right of occupancy under a tenancy agreement’.
appellants’ challenge to the trial judge’s conclusion in that
respect is put on a number of bases. The first
is that it was erroneous to
conclude that the legislature did not intend
of the RTA to apply to
the appellants’ tenancy agreements, particularly having regard to the
operation of
of the RTA and
. As an adjunct to that argument, the appellants say that the trial judge
also incorrectly understood that a determination of rent
with application to the
appellants had been made prior to the First Determination, and that there was a
legal concept of ‘base
rent’, when no prior statutory determination
had been made and the only relevant concept under both the RTA and
Housing Act
was ‘rent’. The second basis for the
challenge to the trial judge’s conclusion is that it was erroneous to
that the responsible Minister was not the ‘landlord’ for
the purposes of
of the RTA in circumstances where the responsible
Minister was either acting as an agent of the Commonwealth pursuant to
Housing Act
, and/or an emanation of the same Crown
as the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) and/or the Commonwealth. The third
basis for the
challenge to the trial judge’s conclusion is that the
responsible Minister was the
‘landlord’ for the
purposes of
of the RTA having regard to
ss 16(2)(h)
Housing Act
Operation of
Housing Act
appellants’ principal contention under this ground of appeal is that there
is no conflict between the limitation in
of the RTA on a
landlord’s right to increase the rent payable under a tenancy agreement
and the power of the Minister under

determine the rent to be paid.
Any apparent or potential conflict is said to be resolved in favour of the RTA

and general import, such that the RTA is
afforded primacy over the relevant
provisions of the

with no exclusion of the application of subs 41(1) to a tenancy of that
extent it may be required,
of the RTA contains a mechanism
which empowers the Minister to exempt specified classes of tenancy agreement
from all or any of the
provisions of the RTA, subject to a notice and
consultation process.
[33] The trial
judge found that the omission from
of the RTA of
specified provision which does not apply to a tenancy under the
was not indicative of a legislative intention that
was to have
such application. That is because the mechanism permitting the rent payable by a
tenant in public housing to be fixed
by determination under
Housing Act
rendered express exemption
unnecessary.
The appellants
submit that the effect of that interpretation would be to allow those procedural
fairness protections in
to be circumvented by the ‘stroke of a
Ministerial pen’ and to subvert the way in which the
Housing Act
intended to be read with the RTA.
appellants’ further or alternative submission is that the two provisions
are capable of harmonious operation if the
is taken to permit only the reduction of rent, with an increase in rent
available only if the requirements of
of the RTA are satisfied. The
appellants say that construction would not operate to make a determination under
Housing Act
inoperative, but only to subject it to the
limitations imposed by the RTA in the manner contemplated by
Housing Act
. That is said to be consistent with a scheme under which rent
increases are permitted only if the criteria stipulated in
satisfied, but the manner in which rent may be reduced is not limited under the
terms of the legislation to the means permissively
specified in
RTA. That difference in approach is said to be explicable from a policy
perspective to ensure that tenants are afforded transparency,
clarity and
predictability in how their financial obligations under the tenancy agreement
may increase in the future.
appellants say that the consequence of that constructional approach is that
Housing Act
, which provides that the rent to be paid
is the rent determined by the Minister under subs (1) despite anything to
the contrary contained
in any other arrangement or agreement, operates only to
the extent it gives rise to a rent reduction or, alternatively, a rent rise
authorised by the specific terms of the tenancy agreement. That is because
Housing Act
would otherwise have the effect of
overriding the legislature’s clear expression of intent in
the RTA that any rent increase is authorised ‘only if’ and to the
extent contemplated by the terms of the tenancy
answering these questions it is necessary so far as is possible to construe the
RTA consistently with the relevant provisions
Housing Act
because the two pieces of legislation are clearly interrelated (not least
because they make express reference to each other),
and are clearly intended to
operate as part of a broader scheme for the regulation of tenancies and the
provision of housing in the
Northern Territory. As was stated in
Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd
the hypothesis ... that there is a rational integration of the legislation of

endeavour to so construe

inefficient, conflicting or unjust
submissions made by the appellants in relation to the operation of
of the RTA and
Housing Act
do not directly
engage with the fact that
of the RTA, in its terms, restricts the
capacity of a ‘landlord’ to increase the rent for a tenancy. The
challenge to
the trial judge’s characterisation of the Chief Executive
Officer (Housing), rather than the responsible Minister, as the
within the meaning of
of the RTA forms the
basis of the second and third grounds of challenge and is discussed further
below, including whether there is
some contrary intention which would warrant
the displacement of the statutory definition of ‘landlord’ appearing
of the RTA.
appellants’ first ground of challenge is, in effect, that it was erroneous
on the part of the trial judge to conclude
that the legislature did not intend
of the RTA to apply to the appellants’ tenancy agreements
given that its application to public housing tenancies was not expressly
That resolves to the
contention that, on proper construction, the scheme created under the RTA and
Housing Act
precludes any increase to the rent payable in respect of
the lease of a dwelling under the
Housing Act
other than in compliance
with the limitations imposed by
of the RTA, regardless of how or by
whom that rental increase is effected.
addressing that contention, the respondents submit that the RTA creates a
general framework regulating the relationship of
landlords and tenants under
residential tenancy agreements. Under that framework,
contemplates that a landlord and tenant may enter into a tenancy agreement
provided it contains certain terms and is signed
by both parties. If a tenancy
agreement does not contain those conditions, or is not signed by all parties,
the tenancy agreement
prescribed in Sch 2 to the RT Regulations is taken to
be the agreement between the
The relevant tenancy
agreements in this case were either taken to be those in Schedule 2 to the RT
Regulations or mirrored the language
of cl 2(2) of Schedule 2.
[40] Clause 2(2)
of the RT Regulations relevantly provides that a tenant must pay the amount of
rent, if any, agreed at the beginning
of the tenancy between the landlord and
the tenant to be payable in respect of the rental payment period. Section 35 of
the RTA provides
that it is a term of a tenancy agreement that the tenant must
pay the rent specified in or under the agreement in the manner and
at the place
specified in the agreement or otherwise agreed in writing. It is as part of that
scheme that s 41(1) of the RTA provides
that a landlord may increase the
rent payable under a tenancy agreement only if (a) the right to increase the
rent, and (b) the amount
of the increase in rent or the method of calculation of
the increase in rent is specified in the agreement. The respondent submits
those incidents demonstrate that the RTA creates a scheme for the regulation of
tenancies between landlords and tenants which
limits the manner in which
landlords may alter rent payable under tenancy agreements.
respondents submit that, conversely, the
Housing Act
creates a different
and more particular framework for the provision of public housing.
That Act and the housing schemes operated under it are administered in
large part by the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) as landlord.
The power of
the responsible Minister under
Housing Act
relevantly to determine the rent to be paid for a dwelling or a class of
dwelling. A ‘dwelling’ is defined in
as a house built or otherwise acquired, and retained, by the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing), or a house in the control of the
Chief Executive
Officer (Housing) as agent for the Territory or the Commonwealth. The
respondents say that under those arrangements,
and quite consistently with the
operation of a public housing scheme,
Housing Act
expressly and unambiguously requires that the rent to be paid for a
‘dwelling’ is the rent determined by the Minister
from time to time,
‘despite anything to the contrary contained in the tenancy agreement
entered into in respect of the dwelling
or in any arrangement or agreement, or
alleged arrangement or agreement, between the tenant of the dwelling and any
other person
(including the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)’.
respondents say that this arrangement affords the RTA and the
Housing Act
harmonious operation, and that the appellants have mischaracterised the trial
judge’s reasoning and finding in this respect
as predicated upon the
existence of a conflict between the two provisions. Rather, the assertion of
conflict was one prosecuted by
the appellants and which the trial judge
addressed in the following terms:
When it is accepted that the
legislature in the RTA, a later enactment to the
Housing Act
provide that the CEOH could be the entity granting the right of occupancy
(effectively the landlord) while retaining the
Minister as the person
responsible for setting rents, the apparent conflict between the provisions
falls away.
respondents also say that the trial judge did not find that
RTA ‘did not apply’ to the appellants’ tenancy
agreements.
Rather, the trial
judge found that
of the RTA effected no constraint upon the
exercise of the Minister’s power under
Housing Act
because of a deliberate decision on the part of the legislature to establish the
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) as the legal person
which granted the right of
occupancy under public housing tenancy
agreements.
It was for that
reason unnecessary for
of the RTA to exclude the operation of
to public housing tenancies only ‘[t]o the extent that’
rent is fixed by the Minister.
Section 41(1)
of the RTA otherwise has application to those tenancies and would
prevent the Chief Executive Officer (Housing), as landlord, from
increasing the
rent unless there was an express term to that effect.
respondents’ submissions in this respect should be accepted. That the RTA
has application to premises under the
Housing Act
is not in dispute. The
relevant question is whether the limitation imposed by
upon what a landlord may do controls and limits the Minister’s power under
Housing Act
to determine rents. The provisions of
Housing Act
are entirely inconsistent with the
appellants’ contention that the Minister is somehow constrained by the
operation of
of the RTA. It may be noticed in this respect that
of the RTA imposes obligations with exclusive reference to tenancy
agreements, and that
Housing Act
in its form at the
material time was enacted after the promulgation of
of the RTA.
[45] It cannot
be said that this stipulation operates only to the extent it gives rise to a
rent reduction or, alternatively, a rent
rise authorised by the specific terms
of the tenancy agreement. Rather, it is this stipulation requiring the rent
determined by the
Minister for a public housing dwelling to prevail over any
other agreement or arrangement. That conclusion is not altered by the
the Minister had made no statutory determination in relation to the relevant
premises prior to the First Determination.
specific stipulation in
Housing Act
, together with
the fact that the Minister is not the ‘landlord’, obviates the need
for any express exemption of the operation
of the general provision in
s 41(1) of the RTA in the
Housing Act
, and explains why it was
unnecessary for
of the RTA to disapply
terms. Conversely, subss 41(2), (3) and (4) would, but for
application to a rent increase irrespective of the circumstance that it was not
imposed by the landlord.
We respectfully agree with the trial
judge’s observation that the relationship between
of the RTA and
Housing Act
reflects a legislative intention that
of the RTA has application to redress inequality of bargaining
power in a market-based residential lease system, and
Housing Act
has application to a social housing system which involves
quite different obligations and considerations.
respondents have filed a Notice of Contention pleading that the trial judge
erroneously decided
that none of
the appellants’ leases contained a provision which satisfied the
requirements of
of the RTA, in circumstances where the lease
between the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) and the fourth appellant dated 20
specified that the
rent was subject to adjustment in accordance with
in a manner that satisfied the requirements of
of the RTA.
[48] It is not
necessary to determine this matter given the finding we have made in relation to
the relationship between
of the RTA and
. Moreover, the argument operates only in relation to the fourth
appellant. However, the matter was the subject of considered submissions
parties and it is appropriately determined.
[49] In order
for a provision to satisfy the requirements of
of the RTA it must
specify both the right to increase the rent and either the amount of the
increase in rent or the method of calculation
of the increase in rent. The
provision in this case forms part of the tenancy agreement by its incorporation
in Schedule 1 headed
‘Public Housing Tenancy Agreement – Periodic
Tenancy’ and signed by the fourth appellant. The provision states
that rent may be adjusted in accordance with
, which grants the Minister the power to determine rents. It may be
accepted that the reference to the adjustment of rent is sufficient
constitute the specification of a right to increase rent, notwithstanding the
level of generality in that formulation. As the
respondents submit, it is
unnecessary for the clause to specify the Minister’s future intentions,
and the language used is
sufficient to convey the necessary information in
relation to the right to increase rent. The reference to adjustment comprehends
the fact that a determination under that provision may entail the rent being
adjusted to a higher or lower amount than the rent currently
[50] Accepting
that to be so, the clause manifestly does not specify the amount of the increase
in rent. Accordingly, in order to
satisfy the requirements of
the RTA it is necessary to characterise the provision that rent may be adjusted
in accordance with
Housing Act
as the specification of
the method of calculation of the increase in rent. The term
‘specify’ carries with it the requirement
that the clause in
question must identify the relevant matter ‘definitely or
explicitly’, ‘in detail’ or
with ‘unambiguous
clarity’. A formulation which identifies matters in general, indefinite
and non-specific terms will
not meet the requirement of
specification.
The adjustment
provision in this case in no way specifies the method of calculation of the
increase in rent. A reference to a singular
power on the part of the responsible
Minister to increase rent outside the scheme of the RTA does not amount to a
method of calculation
in the relevant sense.
[51] The Notice
of Contention is dismissed.
Whether responsible Minister
[52] The second
basis for appellants’ challenge under this ground of appeal asserts that
the responsible Minister was properly
characterised as the
‘landlord’ for the purposes of
of the RTA because the
responsible Minister was acting as an agent of the Commonwealth pursuant to
Housing Act
, and/or was an emanation of the same
Crown as the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) and/or the Commonwealth. The
following findings
of fact made by the trial judge in relation to the tenancy
arrangements are not subject to any challenge on appeal.

the material times, is Aboriginal land within

The Arnhem Land Aboriginal Trust (

over NT Portion 1646, which includes the township of Gunbalanya. On 26 August
2009, the ALAT, the
Northern Land Council, the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)
and the Commonwealth of Australia entered into an agreement through
ALAT granted the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) a lease over the township of
Gunbalanya under
of the ALRA. The residential dwellings occupied by
the first, second and third appellants form part of the land leased to the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing), and the tenancy agreements pursuant to which the
first, second and third appellants occupy the residential
dwellings in question
name the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) as the landlord.
[54] Laramba is
an Aboriginal community living area which was excised from the Napperby pastoral
lease in 1992 under
Pastoral Land Act 1992
comprises NT Portion 4069 over which the Laramba Community Incorporated holds an
estate in fee simple. The residential dwelling
occupied by the fourth appellant
at the material times is situated within NT Portion 4069. On 18 July 2014,
Laramba Community Incorporated,
the Central Land Council and the Executive
Director of Township Leasing (
), a Commonwealth employee, entered
into a head lease concerning certain land in Laramba, including the dwelling
occupied by the fourth
appellant, to facilitate the provision of public housing.
Then, contemporaneously with the grant of the head lease, the EDTL entered
a sublease of the housing stock on that land to the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) to facilitate the provision of public
housing in Laramba by the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing). The residential dwelling occupied by the fourth
appellant formed part
of the housing stock leased to the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing), and the tenancy agreement pursuant to which the fourth appellant
occupied the residential dwelling in question named the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) as the landlord.

Jack v Chief Executive Officer (Housing) (No
The relevant issue in
that matter was whether the Territory should be joined as a defendant to
proceedings seeking payment of compensation
pursuant to s 122 of the RTA
for an alleged breach by the ‘landlord’ of the habitability
obligation imposed by
of the RTA. The plaintiff’s application
to join the Territory was made on the basis that it was either the party which
him the right of occupancy, or that party’s agent, under the terms
of the definition of ‘landlord’ in
of the RTA. The
distinction between a body politic and a statutory body created by that body
politic with separate legal personality
was described in
Jack v Chief
Executive Officer (Housing) (No 2)
in the following terms (footnotes
I turn then to consider the legal personality of the
Territory, and the particular legal personality and function of the CEO in
to public housing. The Territory is the body politic established under
the Crown by the name of the ‘Northern Territory of
Australia’.
Leaving aside purely geographical connotations, the designation ‘Northern
Territory of Australia’
is used variously to mean either the whole body
politic or the executive branch. A government Department is not a body with
juridical personality. A government Department is a unit of
administration with responsibility for an area of government of and
body politic, and has no legal personality of its own. A legislature, including
the Legislative Assembly of the Northern
Territory, may also incorporate or
establish an entity with separate juridical personality to the body politic
which has created
it. Statutory bodies with separate legal personalities are
established to carry out specific functions which may be more effectively
performed outside a traditional departmental structure. A statutory body is
generally created and used when there is a need: for
some operational
independence from government; to accommodate funding arrangements separate to
the annual appropriations processes;
and/or for specific expertise on a
governing board.
A legal entity created for that purpose may take the form of a corporation
sole or a body corporate. Such bodies, when created by
the legislature, are
not the ‘Territory’ or the ‘Crown’, as they have
separate juridical personality. In
the ordinary course, they will hold
property, enter into contracts and conduct litigation in their own names, even
allowing for the
fact that they may also be instrumentalities or agents of the
Territory depending upon the specific provisions of the legislation,
functions of the statutory body in question and the degree of governmental
control to which it is subject. However, that characterisation
determinative of matters such as whether the body enjoys Crown immunities or
whether it is subject to regulatory laws and
legislation with specific
application to the public sector. It does not deny or deprive the body of its
separate legal personality.
[57] For the
reasons given in that passage, and having regard to the terms of
Housing Act
, there is no doubt that the Territory has established the
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) as a corporation sole with quite separate
legal personality. As the Court in
Jack v Chief Executive Officer (Housing)
went on to describe,
the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) is constituted by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Agency responsible for the administration
The functions of the
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) are to provide and to assist in the provision
of residential, office, industrial
or other accommodation for Territory or
Commonwealth public purposes.
The Chief Executive Officer (Housing) is specifically empowered to do such
things as acquire, hold and dispose of real or personal
property; build on land;
maintain, manage and control premises; let premises; sell dwellings; provide
financial and other assistance
for the acquisition of land or buildings for
accommodation; and sell, lease or otherwise dispose of real or personal property
is surplus to its own, the Territory’s or the Commonwealth’s
Most relevantly for
present purposes, the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) is empowered to
‘act as agent for the Territory
or Commonwealth in administering a
Territory or Commonwealth housing
[58] In the
exercise of those powers and the performance of those functions the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing) is subject to the
directions of the
but in the absence of
any countervailing direction it exercises those powers and performs those
functions autonomously. So much is
apparent, by way of example, from the fact
that it is the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) which determines the criteria
person must meet in order to be eligible for a social housing
The moneys for the
performance of those functions are comprised by such moneys as are appropriated
to the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) by the Legislative Assembly; the moneys
received by the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) in the performance of its
and the exercise of its powers; moneys lent to the Chief Executive
Officer (Housing) by the Territory, a statutory corporation or
institution; and advances made by the
[59] The Court
Jack v Chief Executive Officer (Housing) (No 2)
then went on to
describe the practice under which Australian governments have created separate
legal entities to conduct their public
or social housing functions to better
accommodate the conduct of operations of that
The Court then described
the legislative history and the administrative arrangements in the Northern
Territory in the following terms:
In conformance with those usual
arrangements, the entity responsible for public or social housing in the
Northern Territory prior
to self-government was constituted in 1960 as the
Housing Commission. That entity continued in existence under the same name
self-government, and following the commencement of the
in 1982. With the passage of the Housing Amendment Bill in 1998, the
constitution of the Housing Commission was changed from that
of a body corporate
to a body corporate sole, and the name of the entity was changed to the
‘Chief Executive Officer (Housing)’.
It has remained the case
throughout that period that public or social housing functions in the Northern
Territory have been conducted
by an entity with legal personality separate to
that of the ‘Territory’, which is not subject to the requirements
strictures imposed by public sector financial legislation.
Under the current Administrative Arrangements Order, the Minister for
Territory Families and Urban Housing is given responsibility
for the areas of
government constituted by the ‘Chief Executive Officer (Housing)’
and ‘NT Home Ownership’.
However, the ‘Chief Executive
Officer (Housing)’ is not nominated as an Agency for the purposes of
Financial Management Act 1995
(NT) or the
Public Sector
Employment and Management Act 1993
(NT). Accordingly, the CEO is not
subject to the requirements and strictures of that legislation, and particularly
the financial
legislation. Similarly, the NT Home Ownership scheme is also not
nominated as an Agency for the purposes of the
Public Sector Employment and
Management Act
; although it is nominated as an Agency for the purposes of
Financial Management Act
and is subject to the strictures of that
legislation. While the officer constituting the CEO also holds office as the
Chief Executive
Officer of the Department of Territory Families, Housing and
Communities, the establishment and functions of the CEO under the
stand quite separately to the other activities of that Department and,
as can be seen from the establishing legislation extracted
above, the CEO is
expressly created with separate juridical
personality.
[60] Titles
aside, that remains the case under the current Administrative Arrangements Order
and legislative structure. The Minister
for Housing, Local Government and
Community Development is given responsibility for the areas of government
constituted by the ‘Chief
Executive Officer (Housing)’ and ‘NT
not nominated as an Agency for the purposes of either the
Management Act 1995
(NT) or the
Public Sector Employment and Management
[61] Against
that historical and legislative background, the term ‘landlord’ is
used with particularity in
of the RTA. Unless there is plain reason
not to, the term must be given the meaning ascribed to it in
RTA. That section provides:
(a) the person who grants the right of occupancy under a tenancy agreement;
(b) a successor in title to the tenanted premises whose title is subject to the
tenant's interest,
and includes:
(c) a prospective landlord or a former landlord; and
(d) an agent of the landlord, prospective landlord or former landlord.
[62] The use of
the expression ‘means’ to qualify that definition indicates that it
is intended to be exhaustive in scope,
rather than simply enlarging the ordinary
meaning of the word. That usage also tells against the appellants’
submission that
the definition is broad and inclusive, rather than exhaustive.
It may also be noted in this respect that the definition of
is not qualified by any formulations such as
‘unless the contrary intention appears’ or ‘except where
clearly intended’. Although it may be accepted that even in the
absence of express words to that effect such a qualification
is implied as a
natural feature of the constructional
the definition in
of the RTA must be read into the substantive enactment in
the RTA if there is nothing in the text or purpose of the legislation indicating
that the definition is expressly or impliedly
[63] This is not
a case in which the statutory definition of ‘landlord’ is either
expressly or implicitly excluded from
application to
of the RTA by the
text and terms of the legislation. It fits comfortably into the substantive
enactment without logical or grammatical
infelicity. The appellants suggest that
some significance should be attached to the fact that
adopts the formulation ‘a landlord’ when dealing with an increase of
rent, whereas
of the RTA adopts the formulation ‘the
landlord’ in relation to the reduction of rent. The appellants say this is
suggestion that there might be more than one legal entity capable of
characterisation as landlord at any given time. A review of
throughout the RTA does not suggest any significance to the use of the definite
and indefinite articles beyond the fact
that the use of the indefinite article
is used conventionally to indicate membership of a class, which class is still
circumscribed
by the statutory definition. To take just one example, the
requirement in
of the RTA that ‘a landlord’ must provide a
receipt for a cash payment of rent necessarily undermines the appellant’s
submission that the phrase ‘the landlord’ is properly taken to refer
to the landlord named on the lease, whereas the
phrase ‘a landlord’
has some different and more expansive meaning.
[64] That leaves
the question whether the subject matter, purpose and context of the legislation
evince an intention on the part of
the legislature that the definition should
not apply. The onus of showing a contrary intention is on the appellants. As
in the frequently cited passage from
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation
(NSW) v Mutton
there is no
simple formula for determining whether the legislature has evinced a
‘contrary intention’. The circumstances
which might lead to such a
conclusion include where the definition is plainly inconsistent with the
substantive provision, where
the context clearly indicates that the definition
is not to apply, where the application of the definition would render the
substantive
provision unworkable and where the application of the statutory
definition would lead to confusion. To those circumstances may be
situation where the application of the definition would result in the operation
of the substantive provision in a manner
which the legislature clearly did not
None of those
circumstances apply in the present case. Moreover, there is nothing in the
context to suggest that the defined term
is not intended to apply. The
proposition that public housing tenants should have the same rights and
protections as tenants under
commercial arrangements is an appeal to sentiment,
rather than the identification of a contextual factor demonstrating contrary
[65] On the
uncontested findings of fact made by the trial judge, it was the Chief Executive
Officer (Housing) who granted the rights
of occupancy to the appellants under
the relevant tenancy agreements. Having regard to the legislative and
administrative arrangements
concerning the establishment and character of the
Chief Executive Officer (Housing), neither the responsible Minister nor the
may be characterised as the ‘landlord’ on the basis that
either was the legal person who granted the relevant rights
of occupancy. That
is a very different question to whether the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)
might be characterised as the ‘alter
ego’ or emanation of the Crown
for the purpose of determining the application or disapplication of a regulatory
[66] It is also
not possible to characterise the responsible Minister as the
‘landlord’ for the purposes of
of the RTA on the basis
that the responsible Minister was acting as an agent of the Commonwealth
pursuant to
Housing Act
. That provision allows
that the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) may ‘act as agent for the
Territory or Commonwealth in administering
a Territory or Commonwealth housing
scheme’. That provision has nothing to say about any agency arrangement
between the responsible
Minister and the Commonwealth, and no bearing on the
separation of legal personality between the Territory and the Chief Executive
Officer (Housing).
[67] Similarly,
and for the reasons already described, the fact that the responsible Minister
might be described as an emanation or
officer of the same Crown as the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing) in no way sustains a legal conclusion that the
responsible Minister
was the person who granted the rights of occupancy under
the relevant tenancy agreements. The Legislative Assembly has expressly
constituted the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) as a separate legal
personality with the function of providing residential accommodation
purposes, and to act as agent for the Territory or the Commonwealth in
administering a housing scheme. The Legislative
Assembly has made that provision
in circumstances where the Territory has executive authority to administer
public and social housing
schemes on its own account should it determine to do
so; but it has not. To find in that statutory and functional context that the
responsible Minister is indistinguishable from the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) for the purposes of administering tenancy arrangements
for public or
social housing would be to ignore the legislative arrangement, and to proceed on
the basis that the legislature does
not mean what it
appellants’ alternative proposition that the responsible Minister is an
emanation or officer of the Commonwealth Crown
also provides no basis on which
to conclude that the responsible Minister was therefore the
‘landlord’ for the purpose
of the RTA. Leaving aside
esoteric arguments about the divisibility of the Crown, and whether a Northern
Territory Minister might
be characterised as an ‘officer of the
Commonwealth’ for the purpose of
Constitution
Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978
Self-Government Act
) established the Northern Territory of Australia as a
separate body politic under the Crown (s 5), the Legislative Assembly
the office of the Administrator (s 32) and the Executive
Council of the Northern Territory comprising the persons for the time being
holding Ministerial office (s 33); and conferred duties, powers, functions
and authorities upon the Legislative Assembly and these
institutions.
[69] As part of
the establishment of the self-governing body politic, s 6 of the
Self-Government Act
confers on the Legislative Assembly the power
‘to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the
Territory’.
The exercise of legislative power by the Legislative Assembly
is not an exercise of the Commonwealth Parliament’s legislative
Section 35 of the
Self-Government Act
confers executive authority on the Ministers of the
Territory with reference to specific heads of executive authority prescribed in
reg 4 of the
Northern Territory (Self-Government) Regulations 1978
(Cth). Those heads of executive authority include ‘Housing’.
Under those constitutional arrangements, the exercise of
those heads of
executive authority by Ministers of the Territory is not an exercise of
Commonwealth executive authority.
[70] Even if it
were to be accepted for the sake of argument that the responsible Minister was
an emanation of the Commonwealth Crown,
that would not sustain any conclusion
that the Commonwealth was the legal person which granted the rights of occupancy
relevant tenancy agreement, or any conclusion that the Chief Executive
Officer (Housing) does not have a legal personality distinct
and separate from
that of both the Territory and the Commonwealth. As the respondents submit, that
proposition proceeds from the
logical fallacy that ‘the Crown’ is a
form of juridical entity so that all entities which are associated with it may
be treated as a single person or that each emanation may be treated identically.
Neither is the executive government of the Northern
Territory a single juristic
entity. It is a politically organised group of entities comprising the body
politic of the Territory
(as a legal person), its unincorporated agencies and
instrumentalities, and its agencies and instrumentalities which have their own
legal personalities (such as the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)). It is wrong
to treat those distinct entities as the same legal
person merely because they
may each be classified for some purposes as emanations of the
Whether responsible Minister
[71] Finally
under this ground of appeal, the appellants assert that the responsible Minister
‘landlord’ for the purposes of s 41 of
the RTA. The basis for that assertion would appear to be that in increasing the
rent to be paid to the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) by determination under
Housing Act
, the responsible Minister was necessarily
acting as ‘landlord’ in the relevant sense. Alternatively, the
appellants say
of the RTA is concerned with the source of the
obligation to pay, not the source of the amount to be paid. Accordingly, the
Executive Officer (Housing) is properly taken to have increased the rent
payable under the tenancy agreement within the meaning of
by requesting and collecting increased rent, notwithstanding that the increase
was consequent upon a determination made
alternative proposition may be dealt with in short order. A landlord does not
increase the rent payable under a tenancy
agreement by collecting rent in a
particular amount. Moreover,
Housing Act
plain in its terms that
is the source of both ‘[t]he rent to be
paid for a dwelling’ and the obligation to pay ‘despite anything to
contrary contained in [a] tenancy agreement’.
[73] So far as
the appellants’ primary proposition is concerned, the meaning of
‘landlord’ is a matter of statutory
construction. As already
described, the term ‘landlord’ is given a specific and technical
meaning for the purposes of
the RTA. The question of who is properly
characterised as the ‘landlord’ for the purpose of the RTA is a
question of
law. The question whether the facts as found satisfy a relevant
definition contained in a statutory enactment properly construed
question of law. The appellants’ proposition that the responsible Minister
‘landlord’ for the purposes of
the RTA does not engage with the statutory definition and the process of
construction involved in determining whether the responsible
Minister fell
within the definition of ‘landlord’ in the RTA.
appellants say that this
characterisation also follows from the
provisions of
ss 16(2)(h)
Housing Act
already described,
Housing Act
allows that the
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) may ‘act as agent for the Territory or
Commonwealth in administering a Territory
or Commonwealth housing scheme’.
There is nothing in the factual findings to sustain the further finding that the
Chief Executive
Officer (Housing) was acting as the ‘agent’ of the
Territory in the administration of the relevant tenancy arrangements.
‘agent’ is imprecise and protean in scope, and the meaning to be
ascribed to the term as it appears in a statute
will depend upon the language,
context and purpose of the statute. As used in
the term means that the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) may act on
behalf of the Territory or Commonwealth for the purpose of administering
housing scheme, including in the technical legal sense of having authority to
create legal relations between the Territory or Commonwealth
and a tenant under
such a scheme. However, even if it is accepted that the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) was acting as an agent
of either the Territory or the Commonwealth in
the provision of social housing in the townships of Gunbalanya and Laramba in
general sense contemplated by
Housing Act
that in no way sustains a conclusion of either fact or law, or mixed fact and
law, that it was the responsible Minister, or even
the Territory, which granted
the rights of occupancy under the relevant tenancy agreements.
Housing Act
provides that the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) is
subject to the directions of the responsible Minister. There is no evidence
sustain the conclusion that the Minister provided any direction to the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing) in relation to the administration
of the scheme
generally, or in relation to the relevant tenancy arrangements specifically. In
any event, while it is no doubt the
case that directions may be given in
relation to broad strategic and financial matters, the deployment of the power
of direction
by the responsible Minister would not as a matter of legal
characterisation supplant the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) as the
entity which granted the rights of occupancy under the relevant tenancy
agreements. For reasons which have already been described,
the fact that a power
of Ministerial direction is an indicium which may assist in the determination of
whether a particular body
might be characterised as the ‘alter ego’
or emanation of the Crown for the purpose of determining the application or
disapplication of a regulatory regime, whether a corporation conducts its
operations by legal personality distinct from the Crown
is a quite different
[76] That result
is not altered by the fact that the moneys of the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) may be derived by appropriation
or loan from the Territory in
accordance with
Housing Act
, and that under
Housing Act
the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) may only administer
prescribed housing schemes or those approved by the responsible Minister.
appellants say the facts that
Housing Act
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) to be a creature of statute, that
makes the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) subject to ministerial direction,
establishes a financial relationship with the Crown, and that
demonstrates further subjection to Ministerial control, demonstrate
the ‘unitary’ nature of these emanations of the Crown
notwithstanding their different legal personalities. Whatever the rhetorical
force of that submission might be, it does not alter
the separate juridical
personality of the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) and the definition of
‘landlord’ in the RTA.
[78] To the
extent that the appellants’ assertion in this respect extends to the
proposition that the responsible Minister was
the ‘landlord’ for the
of the RTA as ‘an agent of the landlord’ within
placitum (d) of the definition in the RTA, that proposition must be rejected
the reasons given in
Jack v Chief Executive Officer (Housing) (No
‘agent’ as it appears in the definition of ‘landlord’
denotes a person or other entity having the
landlord’s authority in
relevant respects concerning the control and management of the tenancy. An
one within whose authority and power it is to discharge
the landlord’s statutory obligations and exercise the landlord’s
statutory rights under the RTA and the relevant tenancy agreement. On that
construction, neither the Territory nor the responsible
Minister is capable of
characterisation as the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)’s agent for the
purposes of the management
of these premises specifically, or the provision of
public or social housing generally.
[79] For these
reasons, this ground of appeal must fail.
The application of
uncodified policy
appellants’ second ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in
concluding that an uncodified policy could lawfully
increase the rent payable by
the appellants despite
of the RTA and/or
. This is a reference to the trial judge’s findings in the
following terms:
The SAG considered a number of different
methodologies for determining base rent for remote dwellings. A record of the
the SAG on 9 November 2018 reveals that all members of the SAG agreed
that the operational cost per bedroom model was the best model.
This model was
approved by Cabinet in December 2021. The model approved by Cabinet provided for
base rent for a remote public housing
dwelling to be determined based on the
number of the bedrooms the dwelling contains and to be set accordingly by the
Minister pursuant
Housing Act
. The model approved by
Cabinet contained a safety net by way of a policy allowing the CEOH to only
charge a portion of the full rent
payable by a tenant on a temporary basis, if
the tenant would encounter rental stress due to being required to pay the full
payable pursuant to the Determination. The government policy is for the
CEOH to require such tenants to pay an amount equivalent
to 25% of the total
household income of the relevant dwelling, initially for up to 6 months.
The second way in which the interests of the lessee in public housing are
protected is by the adoption by the government of a policy
of granting
exceptions to the base rent as determined by the Minister in cases where
requiring the lessee to pay the determined rent
would lead to rent stress. This
is referred to as a rental rebate. The content of that policy and how it is
administered are also
matters upon which the government is answerable to the
legislature and to the people of the Northern
[81] This second
ground of appeal is brought in relation to the second declaration sought in the
original application for judicial
review in terms that:
increase by way of an increase in the percentage of the plaintiff’s income
is unlawful having regard to
of the RTA.
appellants’ submission is that the ‘safety net’ policy was
contrary to both
of the RTA and
Housing Act
and quite distinct from the Determinations in terms of their time of
promulgation, manner of administration and legal source. In
particular, the
Determinations calculated rent by reference to the number of rooms of the
dwelling, were promulgated by the responsible
Minister and published in the
. In contrast, the policy was calculated by reference to household
income, subject to amendment by the unilateral act of a single
public servant
and published on a website.
appellants say that the application of the ‘safety net’ policy
purported to increase the rent to be paid by tenants
from either 18 percent of
the pension entitlement or 23 percent of household income to 25 percent of the
same income by which rents
were previously calculated. The appellants say that
in the case of the third appellant, by way of example: (a) at the time of the
hearing before the trial judge the relevant tenancy agreement contained no
provision for a rental amount; (b) the third appellant’s
total household
income was constituted by a $443 disability support pension; (c) in the
application of the safety net policy the
third appellant’s rent under the
Determinations ought to have been $79.74 per week, being 18% of his household
income, but
he was in fact being charged a rental amount of $99 per week; (d) by
the application of the safety net policy the third appellant’s
rent was to
be increased with effect from 6 February 2023 to 25 percent of the same
household income, being $109.75 per week; (e)
on 20 December 2022 the relevant
government functionary wrote to the third appellant advising that for a period
of six months his
rent would be 25 percent of total household income, resolving
to $114 per week; and (f) at the conclusion of that six-month period,
appellant’s rent would be fixed at $140 per week under the terms of the
applicable Determination.
appellants say that series of circumstances and directives operated to increase
rent in a way which did not comply with
of RTA given that none of
the relevant tenancy agreements provided for increases in rent or specified a
mechanism by which departmental
policy might lead to increases in rent. At the
same time, the application of the policy set rents at a rate inconsistent with
Determinations under
Housing Act
(assuming their
validity and applicability) and contrary to the dictate in
Housing Act
[85] At the
material time, and now, reg 4 of the
Housing Regulations 1983
relevantly provided that the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) may let a
dwelling to an eligible person, and that a letting ‘must
be ... subject to
regulation 5
, at the rent of the dwelling determined under section 23 of the
[Housing] Act for that dwelling’.
Regulation 5
provided that ‘[t]he
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) may, in its discretion, grant a rebate of the
whole of the rent payable
in respect of a dwelling by an eligible person, or of
such portion of that rent as it thinks fit, and for such period as it thinks
appellants say that provision provided no support for the purported application
of the safety net policy. First, they say
that reg 5 is inconsistent with
the stipulation in
Housing Act
, and therefore
invalid, to the extent that it purports to authorise rent other than as
determined by the Minister. Second, only a
person who meets the definition of
‘eligible person’ qualifies for a rebate under reg 5. At the
material times that term
was defined in reg 3 to mean a person who in the
opinion of the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) was ‘of limited means;
not adequately housed’. The appellants submit there is no evidence the
Chief Executive Officer (Housing) ever held that opinion
of any of the tenants.
Third, the safety net policy was not a Ministerial direction under
Housing Act
, was not otherwise binding on the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) in whom the rebate power is vested and could not constitute the
exercise of the rebate power.
[87] On the
appellants’ characterisation, the purported application of a
‘rebate’ under the safety net policy is,
at law, a rent reduction
of the RTA. Unlike
, that provision requires no specific
term in a tenancy agreement, and the landlord can reduce rent at any time by any
the tenant’s agreement, temporarily or otherwise. Once reduced,
it may only be increased in compliance with the limitations
of the RTA. On this argument, it would follow that the rent payable
by each of the appellants was the rent last agreed by them prior
to any attempt
to increase it contrary to
of the RTA.
[88] As the
respondents submit, the trial judge did not conclude that the safety net policy
could increase the rent payable by law
by the appellants. The trial
judge’s only relevant finding or order in this respect was that the
plaintiff’s application
for relief, including in terms of the second
declaration sought, was dismissed. That claim for relief in terms of the second
declaration
was premised on the basis that the move from the rebates applied to
remote public housing under the previous framework to the rebates
applied under
the safety net effected an increase in rent.
[89] What the
evidence disclosed in that respect, and what the trial judge found so far as was
necessary for the purpose of the judicial
review application, was that prior to
December 2021 rent was calculated for remote public housing properties so that
it would not
exceed a maximum limit fixed by reference to the number of
As part of that
previous framework, tenants could apply for a rebate under reg 5 of the
Housing Regulations
so that they paid either the maximum limit or a
specified percentage of their household income (ordinarily 23 percent),
was less. That framework was adopted in May 2010 as a policy of the
Chief Executive Officer (Housing), rather than pursuant to a
determination under
Housing Act
, but neither that distinction nor the trial
judge’s labelling of the maximum limit as ‘base rent’ is
determinative
of any of the issues on appeal.
[90] In March
2018, the Northern Territory Cabinet requested a review of the remote public
housing rent framework with a view to establishing
a simplified and consistent
scheme in which any uncertainty in relation to rental obligations was ultimately
addressed by making
the Determinations under
In response to
Cabinet’s request for a review, the relevant agency convened the SAG
constituted by representatives from 13
peak bodies in Northern Territory
Aboriginal land, housing, justice and medical services which are listed in the
trial judge’s
reasons for
The model adopted by
SAG was a dwelling-based, operational cost recovery model in which rent was
based on the number of bedrooms
in a dwelling and set at a level intended to
defray the cost of providing remote public housing. That model was subsequently
by Cabinet and the Determinations were
[91] Under the
Determinations, between 2 May 2022 and 5 February 2023 the rent payable was the
same as the maximum limit under the
previous framework. From 6 February 2023
rent was calculated at a fixed rate of $70 per room. In addition to the
Determinations,
the Cabinet approved a policy by which a tenant in financial
stress – the benchmark for that being when rent exceeded 25 percent
household income – could apply to the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)
for rent relief. Under the policy, the Chief Executive
Officer (Housing) could
apply a safety net to reduce the rent payable to 25 percent of household income.
In the application of that
policy, the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)
identified tenants in financial stress and applied the safety net to
[92] Against
that background, it is instructive to consider by way of example the assertions
made by the appellants in relation to
the application of the safety net policy
to the third appellant’s rent. It is asserted that the third
appellant’s rent
was increased by the application of the safety net policy
with effect from 6 February 2023 to 25 percent of household income. On
assumption that the Determinations were valid, the position obtaining prior to
6 February 2023 was that the third appellant’s
rent was fixed by
determination at $175 per week. The application of the safety net policy in fact
reduced that amount by reference
to total household income. Similarly, the
position obtaining from 6 February 2023 was that the third appellant’s
rent was fixed
by determination at $140 per week. The application of the safety
net policy also reduced that amount by reference to total household
the conclusion of the six-month period from 6 February 2023 for which the policy
was expressed to apply, the third appellant’s
rent would be fixed at $140
per week under the terms of the applicable Determination. That did not
constitute the increase of rent
by the operation of the safety net policy. It
simply meant that the safety net policy would no longer be applied to provide
from the full measure of rent payable under the applicable
Determination.
[93] If, as we
have already found, the Minister was not precluded by the operation of
of the RTA from effecting an increase in rent by way of the
Determinations, on proper characterisation it was the Determinations
operated to increase the rent payable under the relevant tenancy agreements
beyond the levels payable under the previous framework.
The effect of the
application of the safety net policy was only to reduce the rent otherwise
payable under the Determinations. That
is so regardless of whether the safety
net policy is characterised as an uncodified policy or a rebate under reg 5
Housing Regulations
, and regardless of whether the policy or
rebate so characterised is invalid for inconsistency with
Housing Act
or the strictures on the application of reg 5 of the
Regulations
The safety net policy operated only with respect to the
Determinations, and without that application the rents payable by the appellant
would be as set out in the Determinations.
[94] It may be
noted in that respect that the relevant relief sought in the appellants’
application for judicial review was
a declaration that any rent increased by way
of an increase in the percentage of the appellants’ income was unlawful.
has been no such increase by way of the application of the safety net, and
there was no application for a declaration that the application
of the safety
net was unlawful on some other ground.
[95] For these
reasons, this ground of appeal must fail.
Denial of procedural
appellants’ third ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by
failing to conclude that those parts of the Determinations
which gave rise to
rent increases, and/or applied to classes of two, three and/or four-bedroom
dwellings, were infected by jurisdictional
error on the basis of a denial of
procedural fairness to those persons whose rights or interests were affected,
including the appellants.
After conducting an extensive review of the
authorities, the trial judge made the following finding in that
... In making the Determinations under s 23, the defendant
was required to balance the interests of both tenants, and prospective
against the interests of the general public in the expenditure of public funds.
Minds may legitimately differ on where the
balance should be set, but the fact
that the legislature has made the Minister the repository of the power to make a
determination
is indicative that the legislature understands that the exercise
of the power is in the nature of a policy or political decision.
The evidence
establishes that in setting a base rent the defendant has adopted a model based
on the operational cost of maintaining
the dwelling, but with the understanding
that it is almost inevitable that some public monies will need to be expended
even if base
rent is paid. This methodology for ascertaining base rent is
overlaid by a policy of rental rebates intended to assist individual
avoid rent stress. It may be expected that many tenants of remote dwellings
will, from time to time, be entitled to a rebate.
This will lead to the need to
expend further public funds.
The nature of the power being exercised (being a power of a policy or
political nature), the number of people as a class potentially
affected by the
exercise of the power and the fact that the exercise of the power does not
affect the plaintiffs other than as members
of an affected class convince me
that the legislature did not intend that the exercise by the defendant of the
power to make the
present Determinations under
Housing Act
regard to a class of dwellings was conditioned on the Minister affording the
plaintiffs a right to be heard before any Determination
The fact that a Determination under
may be made regarding an individual
dwelling, as opposed to a class of dwellings, does not alter this position. The
same considerations
which influence me to find that the defendant was not
required to provide the plaintiffs with a hearing before making the present
Determinations will very probably not arise with regard to an exercise of the
power granted by
to make a Determination concerning a single dwelling, and
procedural fairness may imply different obligations on the defendant in
Medway v Minister for Planning
(1993) 30 NSWLR 646].
however, unnecessary to determine that issue in the present
proceeding.
appellants submit that the operative questions under this ground of appeal are
whether the power conferred by
Housing Act
conditioned by an obligation to afford procedural fairness, and, if so, what the
content of that obligation was. They say those
questions are answered by the
unassailable propositions that
Housing Act
is qualified
by an obligation to afford at least a degree of procedural fairness to tenants
of dwellings and that none at all was
given in respect of any of the
Determinations the subject of this appeal.
[98] In putting
the first proposition, the appellants say there is an unusually strong
interpretative presumption that when a legislature
confers powers that affect
the rights and interests of persons, it does so on the condition that the
repository of the power must
afford those persons procedural fairness unless the
requirement to afford procedural fairness is ‘extremely, unambiguously
unmistakeably’ removed by
Parliament.
The appellants say
that the trial judge fell into error by allowing the facts and circumstances of
the power’s application
in this particular case, which were relevant only
to the content of any obligation, to obscure the threshold question of whether
the legislature intended the power to be conditioned by an obligation of
procedural fairness. That is said to be illustrated by the
trial judge’s
reasoning that the exercise of power concerning a class of dwellings tended
against any requirement of procedural
fairness, despite the fact that the power
is capable in its terms of exercise in relation to a single tenant and dwelling.
the trial judge is said to have reasoned that the manner in which the
power had previously been exercised in accordance with government
political considerations illustrated that it was not amenable to any constraints
of procedural fairness.
appellants say that the statutory text and context clearly do not exclude the
entitlement of those potentially affected by
the exercise of power under
Housing Act
to be heard before its exercise. That is so
notwithstanding that the power is exercisable by a Minister, that the power may
be exercised
in respect of a class of dwellings (and therefore tenants as a
class of persons), and that the exercise of the power involves the
consideration
of matters outside those which an individual affected by the power could be
expected to know.
[100] So far as
the first of those matters was concerned, the appellants say that Ministerial
powers are regularly, if not routinely,
subject to obligations of procedural
fairness. To the extent it might be said that imposing an obligation to provide
procedural fairness
on a Ministerial officer would have oppressive effect, the
process of providing procedural fairness could have been delegated to
functionary. By way of illustration, the appellants submit that the responsible
Minister could have delegated the conduct
of that process in respect of each
potentially affected community to each Housing Reference Group, which are
standing bodies made
up of remote tenants in each community and designed
specifically for such kinds of consultation. The appellants note in that respect
that the Housing Reference Groups met on 182 occasions during the course of 2020
and 2021, which was the time leading up to the making
of the First
Determination.
[101] So far as
the second of those matters is concerned, the appellants say that it is not
relevantly significant that the power
was exercisable in respect of a class of
dwellings. Both the classes to be affected and their members were identifiable
prospectively
by reference to resources such as tenancy agreements and rental
payment arrangements already in the possession of the Chief Executive
(Housing). Affording an adequate degree of procedural fairness to each class was
not impracticable. Even putting that to
one side, the legislature also intended
that the power could be exercised in respect of a single dwelling, which would
not give rise
to the same theoretical inconvenience in affording procedural
fairness. Accordingly, the implication that procedural fairness was
excluded is not open.
[102] So far as
the third of those matters is concerned, the appellants say that even if it is
accepted that the reasons or considerations
underlying an otherwise valid
exercise of the power may be of such a nature that there would be nothing on
which a person affected
could realistically have anything to say, that may not
always be the case.
respondents’ position at the hearing of the appeal was to accept that the
exercise of the power conferred by
Housing Act
subject to the requirement to afford procedural fairness ‘in a general
sense’. The respondents say that the focus
of the specific inquiry must be
whether the individual appellants were entitled to a hearing in relation to the
exercise of the responsible
Minister’s power, and that no complaint can be
levelled by the individual appellants on the basis that procedural fairness
owed and not accorded to other persons who may have been members of remote
social housing tenants as a
The respondents’
analysis in that respect commences with the decision of the High Court in
Bread Manufacturers of New South Wales v
which determined that
the exercise of a power to fix the price of bread was not conditioned on giving
affected sellers advance notice
of any proposed change and an opportunity to be
heard. Chief Justice Gibbs stated (footnotes omitted):
v. Randwick Municipal Council
, Barwick CJ said:
"The common law rule that a statutory authority having power to affect the
rights of a person is bound to hear him before exercising
the power is both
fundamental and universal ... But the legislature may displace the rule and
provide for the exercise of such a
power without any opportunity being afforded
the affected person to oppose its exercise. However, if that is the legislative
it must be made unambiguously clear."
As a general statement this is correct. There is no doubt that, in the
absence of a clearly expressed legislative intention, no one
can be dismissed
from office, penalized, or deprived of or prejudiced in relation to his property
without being afforded an adequate
opportunity to be heard. It may be said that
an order fixing the maximum price at which goods may be sold affects the
existing right
of the seller to sell them at whatever price he chooses. Such an
assertion seems rather artificial when the price of the goods is
already fixed,
and the order that is challenged increases the maximum price. But the question
whether a seller who will be affected
by an order under
of the Act must be
given an opportunity to put his case against the making of the order before it
is made should not be answered
in the negative only for the reason that an order
increasing the price does not adversely affect his rights. It is necessary to
the nature of the power in question in deciding whether the observance
of the principle audi alteram partem is a condition of its
[104] In the
respondents’ submission, a finding that the exercise of a statutory power
may attract an obligation to afford procedural
fairness in the nature of a right
to be heard in some circumstances does not lead to the conclusion that the
obligation to afford
procedural fairness attends every exercise of the power.
That is said to be consistent with the distinction drawn by Mason J (as
Honour then was) in
Kioa v West
between the exercise of a power to make a
decision which directly affects a person individually and that which simply
individual as member of the public or of a class of the public. In
the latter case, the decision is of a ‘policy’ or
‘political’ character to which a duty to afford a hearing before
exercising the power does not
The statement by Gibbs CJ
Bread Manufacturers
concerning the conditional application of the
audi alteram partem
principle is also said to be consistent with the
conclusion drawn by Mason J in
Kioa v West
to the effect that a power may
be exercised for different purposes or reasons and requiring a hearing for some
of those purposes
or reasons but not others. The duty to provide a hearing does
not necessarily attach to every decision made in exercise of the
[105] The fact
that a decision may be characterised as of a ‘policy’ or
‘political’ nature, although not necessarily
determinative, is also
relevant to the assessment of whether a person affected by a decision must be
afforded natural justice. While
it is true, as the appellants submit, that
Gleeson CJ observed in
Jarratt v Commissioner of Police
that the very breadth
of the statutory power under consideration in that case was ‘an argument
for, rather than against, a
conclusion that it was intended to be exercised
fairly’, that observation needs to be qualified by reference to the nature
of the power in question. In that case, the power was one which permitted the
Governor to remove a police officer from office. Although
open-textured and
unconstrained by express limitation, it was a power of very narrow compass which
could only be exercised in relation
to an individual and only with adverse
effect. Leaving aside that particular type of power, it has been long recognised
fact that a power is conferred quite unconditionally is a circumstance
that suggests, although not conclusively, that the principles
of natural justice
are not intended to apply.
South Australia v
decided two years after
Kioa v West
, the High Court considered the
operation of a legislative scheme which empowered a judge to declare a person
convicted of sexual
offences against young children to be incapable of
exercising proper control over his sexual instincts, and to order that
indefinite detention. Under that scheme, the Parole Board could
recommend to the Governor in Council the release of a declared person
medical practitioners had examined him or her and were of the opinion that he or
she was fit to be released. In the case in
question, the Parole Board had
recommended release, the Governor in Council declined to act on that
recommendation and the declared
person sought review of the decision on the
ground that he had been denied procedural fairness. The majority determined that
declared person was not entitled to any further hearing before the Governor
in Council exercised the relevant discretion. Justice
Brennan (as his Honour
then was) stated in that respect:
The public interest in this
context is a matter of political responsibility (see Lord Greene MR in
Johnson & Co v Minister of Health
([1947] 2 All ER 395 at 399) and
the Minister is not bound to hear an individual before formulating or applying a
general policy
for exercising a discretion in the particular case by reference
to the interests of the general public, even when the decision affects
individual’s interests. When we reach the area of ministerial policy
giving effect to the general public interest, we enter
the political field. In
that field a Minister or a Cabinet may determine general policy or the interests
of the general public free
of procedural constraints; he is or they are confined
only by the limits otherwise expressed or implied by
[107] While that
case accords a special position to determinations of general policy, the finding
that the Minister was not obliged
to afford procedural fairness to the declared
person when considering the recommendation of the Parole Board was made in
circumstances
giving rise to a number of qualifications. First, the declared
person had been provided with a hearing before the recommending body
the decision-making process, when viewed in its entirety, had provided a
sufficient opportunity for the declared person
to present his case. Second, had
the Governor in Council intended to take into account new matters adverse to the
declared person
which did not appear in the report of the recommending body, and
which the declared person had previously had no opportunity of dealing
there would be an entitlement to be heard on those new matters.
distinction drawn by Mason J in
Kioa v West
between acts which directly
affect a person individually and acts which affect a person simply as a member
of a class of the public
was drawn from the reasons of Jacobs J in
Justice Brennan
(as his Honour then was) drew a similar distinction in saying:
the legislature is more likely to intend the exercise of a statutory power of an
executive, administrative or quasi-judicial nature
to be so conditioned if an
exercise of the powers singles out individuals by affecting their interest in a
manner substantially different
from the matter in which the interests of the
public at large are
[109] Chief
Justice Gibbs had also adverted to that same distinction, from the same source,
Bread Manufacturers
, which distinction was subsequently picked up by
the Full Court of the Federal Court in
Comptroller-General of Customs v
Kawasaki Motors Pty Ltd (No 1)
in the following passage:
determining whether the rules of natural justice apply, high authority warns
that the classification of the power as executive
or legislative “seems
only to introduce a distracting complication into the process of its
decision”: see
Bread Manufacturers of New South Wales v Evans
[1981] HCA 69
(1981) 56 ALJR 89
at 94, per Gibbs CJ. In similar vein, Mason and Wilson JJ
commented (at 101) that “the question of the application of the rules
natural justice is not to be determined merely by affixing a label to describe
the character of the task which is under consideration”.
But there are nevertheless features characteristic of the legislative process
which, if present where a statutory power is under consideration,
towards a conclusion that Parliament did not intend exercise of the power to be
conditioned on the exercise of the rules
of natural justice. Speaking of the
authority whose orders were under consideration in
Bread Manufacturers
(supra), Gibbs CJ said (at 94):
“Its function, at least in the present case, was to make a general
decision of a discretionary character which affected all
consumers and sellers
of bread. In
Salemi v MacKellar (No 2)
(1977) 137 CLR 396
at 452 Jacobs J
drew a distinction between an act which directly affects a person individually
and one which affects him simply as
a member of the public or a class of the
public, and an executive or administrative decision of the latter kind is truly
or “political” decision and is not subject to
judicial review. Although it is unsafe to generalise, I respectfully agree
the significance of the
distinction.”
[110] A similar
distinction was subsequently drawn by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in
Medway v Minister for
That case involved
the power of the Minister for Planning to direct the relevant development
consent authority to refer a particular
development application, or development
applications of a particular class or description, to the Minister for
determination. The
appellants argued that a direction which had the potential to
affect their environmental interests could not be given unless they
informed of the case to be made against them and given an opportunity of
replying to it. Justice of Appeal Mahoney (with whom
Sheller and Cripps JJA
concurred), stated:
There is a further matter of relevance in this
regard. The direction given was in respect of development applications of a
That class included future applications and would extend to
applications of or by different people. Where the persons relevantly
affected by
the exercise of the statutory power are numerous or difficult to identify, or
identify in advance, it may more readily
be inferred that it was not the
legislative intention that, before the exercise of the power, the case sought to
be made be formulated
and notified.
I am conscious that s 101(1) may be used in the case of “a
particular development application” as well as to a class or
description
of applications. It may be that, in the case of a single application affecting
only one person or several identifiable
persons, different considerations may
arise. What procedural fairness requires in the instant case is affected by the
circumstances
of that case. But here, those who, within the
Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act
, could object were a wider and more amorphous
class. And, I think, the evidence shows that others also saw themselves as
entitlement (“a legitimate expectation”) to be
Taking all of these matters into consideration, I am of the opinion that it
was the legislative intention that it was not necessary
for the Minister, before
giving a direction, to formulate “the case sought to be made
against” those whose environmental
interests were apt to be affected by
what he did and to give them an opportunity of making representations before the
direction was
I do not mean by what I have said that no implications are to be drawn as to
procedural fairness in relation to the exercise of the
power under
s 101(1). The principle illustrated in
Kioa v West
and the cases to
which I have referred is a general principle and a beneficial one. But what it
will require to be done in a particular
case will depend upon the circumstances
and context of that case. It is, in my respectful opinion, wrong to treat the
its requirements as fixed and
inflexible.
determination obviously contemplated that the exercise of a statutory power in
some circumstances may attract a requirement
to afford natural justice and in
other circumstances may not. The question whether the circumstances require
natural justice to be
afforded is informed by considerations such as whether the
persons relevantly affected by the exercise of the statutory power are
or difficult to identify.
appellants say that the respondents’ reliance on these authorities fails
to take into account more recent developments
concerning the obligation of
procedural fairness and the powers to which that requirement attaches. The
appellants say that the recent
decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in
Brisbane City Council v
reflects and applies
the contemporary understanding of the obligation of procedural fairness, and
deals with what was said in
accordingly. The power under
consideration by the Queensland Court of Appeal was one which permitted the
appellant Council to approve
the construction of a sign with an electronic
display area of 48 square metres which could be elevated as much as 12 metres
ground level. There was a requirement under the Council’s
regulations that an advertising sign of that type should not block
or compromise
a view or vista of high scenic amenity, and should not obscure, dominate or
overcrowd the views on neighbouring properties.
The first respondent was the
owner of residential premises contiguous to the land on which the sign was
erected. He was not provided
with any notice in relation to the construction
proposal or the Council’s intended consideration of that proposal. He made
application for a review of the Council’s decision on the ground that it
had failed to afford him procedural fairness, and
the primary judge found that
[113] Against
that background, the Court of Appeal observed that the principles of natural
justice may only be excluded by plain words
or necessary intendment, by
reference to the following statement by the plurality in
The presumption that it is highly improbable that
Parliament would overthrow fundamental principles or depart from the general
of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness,
derives from the principle of legality which, as Gleeson CJ
observed in
Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers’ Union
‘governs the relations between Parliament, the executive and the
[114] The Court
of Appeal then stated (footnotes omitted):
Where the decision in
question is one for which provision is made by statute, the application and
content of the doctrine of natural
justice or obligation of procedural fairness
depends to a large extent on the construction of the statute. Neither the Local
nor the Subordinate Local Law expressly excludes the principles of natural
justice. Those principles therefore may only be excluded
by necessary
intendment, noting that the intention must be expressed “with irresistible
clearness”. On a proper construction
of both the Local Law and the
Subordinate Local Law, the fact that a decision to approve the exhibition of a
sign may affect the
interests of various classes of persons in different ways
does not, of itself, evince an intention to exclude the principles of natural
The authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action and Government
Liability (7th ed, LawBook Co, 2022), by reference to
Minister for Local
Government v South Sydney City Council
(“South Sydney City
Council”) and
Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield
City Council
(“Vanmeld”), state at [8.110]:
“If the affected people cannot be identified, fairness may not apply.
But where it is difficult rather than impossible to identify
those people,
fairness may apply with diminished content.”
[115] The Court
of Appeal considered that in the absence of a clear intention to exclude the
principles of natural justice, the question
then becomes what the duty to act
fairly requires in the particular circumstances of the particular case, and any
examination of
the statutory provisions and the affected interests is directed
to that question. That was said to be consistent with the observation
Spigelman CJ in
Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council
that where a power is capable of
application to both large classes and to individuals the inquiry will not be
whether an obligation
to afford procedural fairness exists at all, but what the
content of that obligation is in the specific context. In that analysis,
fact that the identity of all those people who form part of a class affected by
the exercise of a particular statutory power
is difficult to establish does not
necessarily sustain a conclusion that procedural fairness is somehow excluded by
circumstantial
implication.
[116] The Court
of Appeal also had regard to the decision in
Greyhound Racing NSW v Cessnock
& District Agricultural Association
, in which Basten JA
Vanmeld Pty Ltd
involved the promulgation of a local
environment plan under the
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
(NSW). The majority (Meagher and Powell JJA) held that compliance with the
statutory scheme was sufficient to satisfy the requirements
of procedural
fairness. In
South Sydney City Council
, the Court was concerned with
consultation with parties who might be affected by recommendation of the
Boundaries Commission, operating
Local Government Act 1993
(NSW). Again, the statutory context was of importance. In any event, the broadly
stated principles derived from the passages [in
Sydney City Council
] relied upon by the Appellant are not directly
applicable in the present case. It became apparent early in the
Appellant’s
deliberations that, although various other cost saving devices
were contemplated, to make savings in the order of $3.5 million in
a financial
year required reductions in prize money payable at TAB club meetings, a
reduction in the number of race meetings conducted,
or a combination of those
two approaches. Once a reduction in the allocation of dates was identified as a
real possibility, the parties
who would be most directly affected were readily
identified as the twelve TAB clubs. Consultations with those clubs was required
prior to any operative decision being taken...
[117] Those
decisions were taken by the Court of Appeal as illustrating that the preferable
approach is to have regard to the nature
of the interest which may be affected,
but in light of the relevant legislative framework, in order to determine the
nature and extent
of the obligation to afford procedural
The Court of Appeal
then went on to discuss and distinguish three further New South Wales Court of
Appeal cases, including
Gardner v Dairy Industry Authority of New South
a scheme allocating
quotas and fixing production levels for dairy producers affected thousands of
persons involved in the dairy industry,
and on that basis it was found that the
rules of natural justice did not apply. That is because the legislature must
have appreciated
that the powers would have become unworkable if the rules of
natural justice had to be applied in exercising them. Hutley JA stated
‘[t]he rules of natural justice are really only applicable to alterations
of rights of single individuals or small groups,
that is numbers which be
adequately handled by an adversary system of
litigation’.
Those rules
are impliedly excluded where the number of persons affected by a particular
order, act or decision is so great as to
make it manifestly impracticable for
them all to be given an opportunity of being heard by the beforehand. The Court
of Appeal in
distinguished the case before them on the basis that
only a small number of people were affected by the decision, namely the owners
and occupiers of neighbouring properties whose views might be obscured,
dominated or overcrowded by the advertising
[119] In dealing
, the Court of Appeal in
noted the finding that

difficult to identify, or identify in advance’, such that ‘it may

be inferred that it was not the legislative intention that, before
the exercise of the power, the case sought to be made be formulated
In that case,
the question was whether the statute required procedural fairness to be afforded
to identifiable members of an affected
class that was large and predominantly
unidentifiable. However, it is clear that the Court in
saying that the obligation to provide procedural fairness could not attach to
the exercise of the power at all. So much was
apparent from the qualification
that in the case of an application affecting only one or several identifiable
persons different considerations
would arise.
[120] The final
New South Wales case considered by the Court of Appeal in
Castle v Director-General State Emergency
That decision
involved the exercise of a statutory power to revoke the registration of an
emergency services unit, with the consequence
that the local controller’s
appointment was terminated. The Court in that case accepted that although there
may be a general
obligation to afford procedural fairness, the content of that
obligation would depend upon the size of the class affected and the
the affectation. Justice of Appeal Basten stated:
limitation on the operation of the duty to accord procedural fairness arises
from the need to identify the obligation by
reference to an individual or class
of persons. The obligation must be capable of identification and fulfillment, in
a reasonable
and practical sense, prior to the making of the decision. Some
guidance may be obtained by asking whether it was reasonable to expect
officer exercising a particular power to identify, in advance, the applicant as
a person whose rights or interest may be affected
and the way in which the
proposed affectation would occur. The larger the class of persons reasonably
expected to be affected, the
less the likelihood that procedural fairness will
be attracted and, if it is, the lower the likely content of the duty. Similarly,
even though the class of those effected may be small, the duty is less likely to
be attracted if membership of the class is variable
and not readily
ascertained.
[121] Against
that background, the appellants say that there must be a clear delineation
between the distinct questions of whether
an obligation of procedural fairness
is owed and, if so, its content.
It is said that any attempt to collapse the two questions ‘can only be
productive of confusion and potential error’.
That may well be the case
where the power is of narrow compass in that it may only be exercised for a
single purpose and in respect
of a single applicant, as is the case with the
power to grant or refuse a visa. Even with a power of that limited ambit, the
observations
made by Mason J in
Kioa v West
comprehend that a power may
be exercised for different purposes or reasons, some of which will require an
opportunity to be heard
and others of which will not. The duty to provide a
hearing does not necessarily attach to every decision made in exercise of the
proposition that a rigid delineation exists between the analysis of whether
there exists an obligation to provide procedural
fairness, on the one hand, and
the assessment of the content of the obligation to provide reasonable fairness,
on the other hand,
is at odds with the authorities discussed above. Those
authorities, including those commended by the appellants, approach the analysis
in terms of whether the effect of the exercise of the power in the particular
circumstances under consideration is such that the
content of procedural
fairness required a person aggrieved to be given opportunity to be heard. Those
authorities simply echo Mason
J’s observation in
Kioa v West
effect that the critical question in most cases is not whether the principles of
natural justice apply, but what does the
duty to act fairly require in the
particular circumstances of the particular case. It does not follow that because
the exercise of
a power is conditioned in a general sense by a requirement for
procedural fairness that some form of hearing is always required.
[123] Properly
characterised, the trial judge’s finding was not that there was a clear
intention on the part of the legislature
to exclude the principles of natural
justice from the exercise of power under
Housing Act
was that having regard to the nature of the interests which might be affected,
viewed in light of the relevant legislative framework,
the nature and extent of
the obligation to afford procedural fairness did not in the circumstances extend
to require the Minister
to afford the appellants a right to be heard before any
Determination was made. The trial judge accepted that the appellants’
rights and interests might be, and in fact were, affected by the Determinations;
that a statutory power to affect such interests
is ordinarily conditioned by a
requirement to accord procedural fairness; that procedural fairness ordinarily
requires that an affected
person be given an opportunity to be heard; and that
the implication can only be ousted by clear words to that effect. The trial
judge then made particular reference to the fact that the content of the
obligation to accord procedural fairness depends on the
statutory context, and
the decision was directed to whether that content included the right to a
[124] So much is
apparent from the trial judge’s observation that a determination under
Housing Act
in relation to an individual dwelling might
give rise to different considerations concerning the nature and extent of the
to afford procedural fairness. The appellants say that position finds
no support in the text of the legislation. That is not the
case. The different
framework, and give rise to distinctions
concerning the identification of
persons affected and the nature of the rights affected. Consistently with the
reasoning in
(per Spigelman CJ) and
those distinctions include the one properly drawn between the exercise of a
power directed towards the rights and expectations of
a particular individual or
individuals and the exercise of that same power in a manner which affects the
community at large or a
large class within the community. The former type of
exercise will ordinarily attract a right to be heard but the latter type of
exercise may not, particularly where the decision is made by reference to
considerations of policy rather than considerations personal
to an affected
[125] When seen
in this light, it was not in error for the trial judge to have regard to the
circumstances in which the determinations
were made, instead of focusing solely
on the terms of the statute. As the respondents submit, there is no inflexible
rule about what
procedural fairness requires, and the answer to that question
requires consideration of both the statutory context and the facts
circumstances of the particular case. As Basten JA stated in
Whether or not the decisions made in the present case
attracted an obligation to accord the applicant procedural fairness will depend
in part upon the correct analysis of the decisions themselves and the grounds on
which they were made, including the circumstances
in which the power came to be
similar vein, in
Day v Harness Racing New South
Leeming JA observed
that the ‘question whether the valid exercise of... power is conditioned
upon the obligation to accord
procedural fairness does not depend on the
particular facts of a case, but upon the nature of the power’, but that
particular facts of a case do, of course, impact on the content of
any obligation to accord procedural fairness’.
[127] As at the
time of trial, there were 5433 dwellings subject to the
Determinations.
Many of those
dwellings had multiple tenants, each with a separate legal obligation to pay
rent. The operation of the Determinations
extended to unidentified and
unidentifiable persons who in the future might take up a tenancy in one of those
dwellings and/or assume
an obligation to pay rent for one of those dwellings.
This was clearly an exercise of the power in which the persons relevantly
by the exercise of the statutory power were numerous or difficult to
identify. The suggestion that the obligation to afford procedural
fairness could
be reasonably and practicably fulfilled by engagement of the Housing Reference
Groups runs counter to the appellants’
contention, pursued principally in
the ground asserting administrative unreasonableness, that each of the tenancies
required individual
consideration in the fixing of rents with reference to
matters such as the state of repair and proximity to
[128] To those
considerations may be added the fact that the general exercise of power did not
have a particular effect on a limited
class of those people who might be
generally affected by the determination (unlike the situation which presented in
Greyhound Racing NSW
), and any determination
of rent levels for a large class of tenancies under a social housing program is
one overlaid by public finance
and political considerations. The decision here
involved a policy shift from an income-based rent model to a dwelling-based
operational
cost model for remote communities and town camps, affecting more
than 5000 dwellings. It was formulated over the course of four years
regard to the relative benefits of competing policy options, endorsed by Cabinet
and implemented by a succession of responsible
Ministers. It was the type of
determination which did not cast any obligation on the Minister to afford a
hearing to individual public
housing tenants before adopting that policy through
the instrument of the Determinations.
Determinations were fixed by reference to matters of public policy rather than
considerations personal to either the appellants
or to the general class of
which they formed part. As Brennan J observed in the passage from
which is extracted earlier in these reasons, when one
reaches the area of ministerial policy giving effect to the general public
interest, one enters the political field. In that field a Minister may determine
general policy or the interests of the general public
free of procedural
constraints. As the trial judge stated, the fact that the legislature has made
the Minister the repository of
the power to make a determination is indicative
of the policy or political nature of the considerations which may inform the
of the power.
[130] That is
consistent with the High Court’s observation in
Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v
that the ‘whole
object’ of a statutory provision placing a power into the hands of a
Minister ‘is that he may exercise
it according to government
policy’. As the respondents submit, while the repository of the power is
not determinative of the
question whether procedural fairness is required or the
content of that requirement, it is a relevant factor to be taken into account.
Although the power is delegable, it was exercised by the Minister in this
particular case. In any event, an exercise of the power
by a delegate would be
taken to be that of the Minister and therefore would remain one for which the
Minister would be politically
accountable.
[131] As stated
at the outset, this ground of appeal contends that the trial judge erred by
failing to conclude that those parts of
the Determinations which gave rise to
rent increases, and/or applied to classes of two, three and/or four-bedroom
dwellings, were
infected by jurisdictional error on the basis of a denial of
procedural fairness to the appellants. For the reasons we have given,
ground of appeal is dismissed.
The SAG consultation
appellants’ fourth ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in
concluding that procedural fairness was afforded
to the appellants in respect of
the Determinations made in 2021 and 2022 on the basis of the SAG consultation in
2018. That error
is said to arise in circumstances where the rent rates the
subject of the consultation were not replicated in the Determinations;
no evidence on which to conclude that the persons attending the consultation
were, or represented, the people who would
be affected by any future
determination made under
Housing Act
consultation did not include any consideration of the timing or effect of the
Determinations.
relevant finding by the trial judge was in the following terms:
the event that I am wrong in determining that the defendant was not obliged to
provide procedural fairness to the plaintiffs as
part of a class of tenants to
whom the Determinations applied, I will add my satisfaction that the
consultation process undertaken
by the defendant through the SAG was all that
was reasonably required of the defendant in the
circumstances.
[134] As with
the third ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the content of any
obligation of procedural fairness (and thus
the assessment of whether it has
been fulfilled) is informed by the statutory context, and will depend on matters
such as the nature
of the decision to be made, the complexity of the issues,
other demands on the decision-maker, and the significance of the decision
person affected. The submission follows that while the matters of statutory
context go some way to attenuating the content
of the obligation of procedural
fairness, particularly when the power is exercised in respect of a class, even
then what is required
is that a potentially affected person have an opportunity
for meaningful participation in the decision-making process.
appellants submit that the evidence before the trial judge clearly established
that no such opportunity was afforded to
the tenants in this case, even though
this was the first occasion on which the power in
had been used to determine rent under the public housing framework. The
evidence was that communication with tenants around the new
remote rent
framework commenced after the decision was made. In the appellant’s
submission, procedural fairness could not have
been afforded to tenants
concerning decisions made in December 2021, April 2022 and September 2022 by
reason that someone other than
the Minister or an authorised delegate of the
Minister met with various peak indigenous representative bodies in 2018. The
say that quite apart from that temporal dislocation, there was no
evidence that any of the persons who attended the SAG consultations
were remote
public housing tenants.
addition, the appellants submit that the rent rates in the Determinations were
never put to SAG. The public servants who
conducted the consultations advised
the representatives of the various peak bodies that a rent rate per room between
15% (for one
bedroom) and 20% (for four bedrooms) was being considered. There
was also no evidence that SAG met after 2018 or that the representative
were consulted at all in relation to the decisions to make the Second, Third or
Fourth Determinations. Those determinations
deferred the second stage of rent
changes with an adverse financial effect on at least one of the appellants, and
removed 21 communities
from those covered by the Determinations without
affording other communities the opportunity to also press for exemption. The
say that it was unnecessary to satisfy the requirements of procedural
fairness to speak to tenants individually. As already described
consideration of the third ground of appeal, the appellants say that it may have
sufficed for a delegate of the Minister,
or the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) under the direction of the Minister, to consult at the appropriate
stages with a representative
group from each community.
[137] Given the
findings we have made in relation to the third ground of appeal, it is
unnecessary to consider this ground of appeal.
That is because we have found
that having regard to the statutory context and the particular circumstances of
the case, it was unnecessary
for the responsible Minister to afford the
appellants an opportunity to be heard, or anything else in respect of procedural
before making the Determinations.
[138] Subject to
that qualification, had we found that the appellants were entitled to an
opportunity to be heard, it is difficult
to see how that requirement was
satisfied or how that opportunity was afforded on the basis of the SAG
consultations in 2018. Although
the relevant government agency made a laudable
attempt to consult with various peak Aboriginal justice, housing, land
and medical organisations, there is no evidence that any of those
organisations were representing the appellants in any relevant
sense, or that by
consulting with those organisations the appellants were accorded a right to be
Unreasonableness
appellants’ fifth ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by
failing to conclude that the Determinations were
legally unreasonable to the
extent that they purported to effect rent increases and have application to
classes of two, three and/or
four bedroom dwellings. That unreasonableness is
said to arise from the fact that in those respects the Determinations took no
of either any individual failure on the part of the landlord in relation
to the statutory requirements concerning habitability and
security set out in
of the RTA, having particular regard to
of the RTA; or the
proximity of the premises to government, health and education services, in
contradistinction to determinations
in relation to urban premises. Further, or in the alternative, the
appellants say that legal unreasonableness is apparent from the
fact that the
Determinations are inconsistent with the model endorsed by the SAG
consultation.
considering assertions of administrative law unreasonableness (which is
sometimes described as ‘legal irrationality’),
the essence of the
question is whether the statutory decision-maker has exceeded the limits on the
grant of statutory power. The
focus of that analysis is on whether the decision
was ‘within a range of possible [and] acceptable outcomes which are
in respect of the facts and
The threshold for
that form of legal unreasonableness is high, and the test is necessarily
stringent and confined.
Ultimately, the result will turn on whether the decision was illogical or not
based on findings or inferences of fact supported on
logical grounds such that
it was not possible to reach on the available
relevant principles are not controversial and there is no suggestion that the
primary judge misdirected himself concerning
the principle of legal
unreasonableness. As the respondents submit, that principle does not provide a
vehicle for a court to remake
the particular determination under challenge in a
manner which the court might consider to be reasonable, and thereby to find any
contrary determination unreasonable by implication. It is not enough to persuade
a court on review that another rational decision-maker
might have come to a
different determination or approached the matter differently.
[142] However, a
breach of the ‘legal standard of reasonableness’ is not limited to
what is in effect an irrational or
bizarre decision. Where there are no written
or oral reasons for a decision, a claim of legal unreasonableness directs
to the outcome. In that analysis, the outcome will show the decision
to be legally unreasonable where the decision in question lacks
evident and
intelligible justification.
Allsop CJ stated in
Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v
The boundaries of power may be difficult to define.
The evaluation of whether a decision was made within those boundaries is
by reference to the relevant statute, its terms, scope and purpose,
such of the values to which I have referred as are relevant and
any other values
explicit or implicit in the statute. The weight and relevance of any relevant
values will be approached by reference
to the statutory source of the power in
question. The task is not definitional, but one of characterisation: the
decision is to be
evaluated, and a conclusion reached as to whether it has the
character of being unreasonable, in sufficiently lacking rational foundation,
an evident or intelligible justification, or in being plainly unjust, arbitrary,
capricious, or lacking common sense having regard
to the terms, scope and
purpose of the statutory source of the power, such that it cannot be said to be
within the range of possible
lawful outcomes as an exercise of that power. The
descriptions of the lack of quality used above are not exhaustive or
definitional,
they are explanations or explications of legal unreasonableness,
of going beyond the source of
appellants say in the application of that approach that the assessment of legal
unreasonableness is an ‘evaluative
process’ judged as at the time
the administrative power was
The bounds of
reasonableness are informed by the statutory context such that a justification
that might be intelligible in some respects
might nevertheless be legally
unreasonable in a particular statutory context. In illustrating this submission,
the appellants point
to the hypothetical situation in which a decision to raise
a person’s rent because they are not a member of the military would
provide an intelligible justification for the decision of a statutory agency
tasked with housing military personnel, but it would
not provide an intelligible
justification for an exercise of the power under
, which contains no textual or contextual indicator of a preference for
military personnel.
[144] Applying
those principles to the case at hand, the appellants submit that the starting
point for the analysis is the fact that
the Determinations purported to operate
such that all premises across all remote communities and town camps were
required to pay
the same rent per bedroom regardless of the state of that
premises or its location. The appellants say that ‘a particular
of that approach is its lack of responsiveness to access to services
from each location, in circumstances where the Ministerial approach
determining urban rent (on the ‘factor principle approach’) is the
fact that ‘service availability and general
amenity’ inevitably
impact property value, and thus rational rent. The appellants say that in the
application of that approach,
increments of as little as five dollars, and
variations of as little as three kilometres, are used to inform other exercises
Housing Act
. In the appellants’
submission, a failure to take into account the state of the premises and the
proximity to services is necessarily
unreasonable given the objective factual
salience of those considerations.
[145] It should
be noted in this respect that the appellants’ assertion of non-compliance
by the Chief Executive Officer (Housing)
in respect of the premises is
irrelevant to the assessment of reasonableness, beyond the proposition that
administrative rationality
required the state of each premises to be taken into
account for the purpose of fixing rent. Even leaving aside the fact that the
trial judge made no finding of non-compliance, the question of non-compliance by
landlord is a matter which is addressed under the
mechanisms of the RTA,
including the power to order compensation for breach, rather than one which
operates as a limiting factor
on the exercise of the power under
Housing Act
appellants submit further that the adoption of classes in the Determinations was
‘based on an unwarranted assumption’
of uniformity which does not
exist. The appellants seek to illustrate this lack of uniformity through a
comparison of the respective
locations of Laramba in central Australia and
Gunbalanya in west Arnhem Land, and the different defects apparent in the three
premises. In the appellants’ submission, those differences should
rationally have borne on the assessment of reasonable rent,
and the fact they
did not rendered each Determination ‘plainly unjust, arbitrary,
capricious, or lacking common sense’.
[147] The trial
judge was satisfied that the ‘operational cost model – cost per
bedroom’ recommended by the SAG
provided a sufficient justification for a
class-wide determination of rent without reference to differences dwelling
condition, location,
proximity to services or other variables. In making that
finding, the trial judge had particular regard to the fact that the power
Housing Act
was expressly available in respect of
‘a class of dwelling’, and considered that the submission made by
the appellants
would ‘either render nugatory the power thus provided to
the [responsible Minister], or would make its exercise dependent upon
identification of classes of dwelling with similar
attributes’.
appellants say that alternative result would both allow the power meaningful
operation and permit the calibration of rents by
reference to an individual
dwelling or a class of dwellings. The appellants say that result is to be
preferred over one in which
individual circumstances are elided by class-wide
determinations for the sake of administrative convenience.
leaving those matters aside, the appellants assert that the ‘operational
cost approach – cost per bedroom’
was not ultimately implemented in
the Determinations. That model produced a bedroom-based flat rent rate of around
(and often less
than) $60 in 2018. By the time the First Determination was made
in 2021, and when the Second and Third Determinations were made in
original model had been replaced by a scheme which adopted a bedroom-based flat
rent rate of $70. The appellants say this
resulted in an increase in rent of up
to 20 percent per household more than that under discussion during the SAG
consultation. The
appellants say that to the extent the respondents’
affidavit evidence seeks to attribute this increase to ‘increases
Centrelink entitlements during the period between 2018 and 2021’, that
rationale was irrational because:
(a) an ‘income based rent’ model had been rejected by
‘stakeholders’ during the SAG consultation and not
pursued by the responsible Minister; and
(b) a significant proportion of remote tenants were not reliant on Centrelink,
including two of the appellants, and whose income
may have been reduced between
2018 and 2021 (for example, as a result of the impact on the pandemic on the
tourism industry).
appellants say on this basis that even if the ‘operational cost approach
– cost per bedroom’ was capable
of furnishing an evident and
intelligible justification for a determination that accurately implemented that
approach, the departure
from that approach deprived the Determinations of that
justification.
[150] A number
of observations may be made in relation to the proposition that the model
adopted during the course of the SAG consultation
was not ultimately
implemented. While it is correct to say that the Determinations adopted a rate
of $70 per room when the SAG had
adopted a model based on a rate of $60 per
room, there is nothing to suggest that a rate of $60 per week would have been
reasonable but $70 per room would not. Moreover, both the SAG and
Cabinet were briefed about the proposed
which was modest
taking into account inflation across the four year period between the
consultation and the implementation. There
is no evidence that the responsible
Minister adopted the increased rate on the basis that there had been an increase
in Centrelink
entitlements, and no basis for any conclusion that the responsible
Minister was thereby adopting an income-based rent model. Even
responsible Minister’s decision was informed by an increase in Centrelink
entitlements, the model remained bedroom-based
and it could not be said that the
capacity of a class of tenants to pay for a social housing service was an
irrelevant or irrational
consideration in the fixing of rent for that
[151] Against
that background, the respondents submit that close attention must be given to
the relevant features of the particular
statutory framework within which the
authority arises because ‘the question to which the standard of
reasonableness is addressed
is whether the statutory power has been
abused’. Because there were no limiting criteria and no obligation to
provide a statement
of reasons for the Determinations under
Housing Act
, the Court’s inquiry is ‘outcome focussed’.
In the assessment of outcome the Minister had a degree of ‘decisional
freedom’ within which ‘reasonable minds may reach different
conclusions about the correct or preferable
Accordingly, it
may only be concluded that the Determinations were unreasonable if they lay
outside the zone of rational choices
available to the responsible Minister. In
the application of those principles, the respondents make the following
submissions.
[152] First, the
conferral of power under
Housing Act
determination in relation to a class of dwelling contemplates that although
there will be individual variations within
a class consisting of dwellings with
a uniform number of bedrooms, the application of a uniform rent across those
variations does
not constitute an abuse of power. Moreover, the Determinations
were consistent with the longstanding practice of determining maximum
rents by class rather than individual attributes or characteristics. There is no
textual basis for the implication of a
limitation on the power which would
operate to require the responsible Minister to adopt classes constituted only by
dwellings with
similar attributes or characteristics. The relevant criterion of
class or commonality adopted by the responsible Minister was the
bedrooms, and the assertion that different criteria should have been adopted is
essentially a merit-based criticism rather
than a matter demonstrating
unreasonableness in the relevant sense. That is because there is nothing
self-evidently controlling or
determinative about the relationship between
reasonable rent and criteria such as the proximity to services or non-compliance
the landlord.
[153] Second,
market factors are not the only ‘legally reasonable’ criteria for
fixing rent for public housing, any more
than they are the only reasonable
criteria governing the other aspects of a social housing system. There is
nothing in the text of
Housing Act
which limits the
policy which the responsible Minister may pursue in determining rents, and it
was quite open, as the trial judge
found, for the responsible Minister to adopt
a cost-based model. There is nothing arbitrary or capricious about the rent
to public housing tenants bearing a relationship with the cost of
providing (including maintaining) that housing, or with the adoption
number of rooms in a dwelling as a rough measure for that cost. Although the
concept of ‘market value’ may limit
the capacity of the Chief
Executive Officer (Housing) to sell publicly owned properties (
s 37(2)(c))
similar limitation is imposed in respect of fixing rent.
[154] Third, the
evidence disclosed a course of policy formulation and decision-making which
provided an intelligible justification
for the Determinations. That process has
already been described briefly in the context of the second ground of appeal.
a Cabinet determination that the previous framework was in need of
reform and a determination to set up a new policy
The SAG was convened
to evaluate replacement models, and considered a number of models including
cost-recovery, market rent and the
factor principle approach now urged by the
appellants as the only rational basis for fixing rent. Different stakeholders
for different models during the course of the consultation. That
process culminated in the SAG resolving that the best model was
a dwelling-based
operational cost model which comprised a flat rent on a per bedroom basis. The
basis for that determination was
essentially because an income-based model
yielded increased rent with any increase in the number of tenants in a dwelling,
was important to ensure that rent remained affordable and that the scheme
remained sustainable.
remote rent framework was considered and adopted by the SAG without objection at
a meeting conducted on 9 November
The endorsement of this
model by the SAG, and subsequently by Cabinet, militates against proposition
that the model adopted in the
Determinations fell outside the ‘range of
possible [and] acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts
law’ or lacked ‘evident and intelligible
justification’.
[155] Fourth,
the discretion conferred by
Housing Act
is broad and
textually unconfined. That is particularly so where the repository of the power
is a Minister of the Crown and the exercise
of the power is legitimately
informed by considerations of
Those considerations
include such matters as fiscal, economic and social policy, involving a
‘polygenic exercise’ which
also militates against any finding that
the Determinations were not within the range of available outcomes available to
the responsible
respondents also draw attention to the contextual fact that the maximum rents
for all classes of dwellings covered by the
Determinations are substantially
lower than those for all other classes of public housing in the Territory. In
the period between
2 May 2022 and 5 February 2023, remote maximum dwelling rents
were set in line with the lowest public housing urban full rent in
2010. Urban
full rents have since increased, with the lowest being those in Pine Creek at
$200 (1 bedroom), $245 (2 bedroom/duplex),
and $310 (3 bedroom). Those rents are
substantially and significantly higher than the rents payable for properties
covered by the
Determinations, and substantially and significantly lower than
rents in the private market.
respondents’ submissions in that respect should be accepted. As Gageler J
(as his Honour then was) observed in
this ground of
review is particularly difficult to satisfy where the decision is made by an
administrative decision-maker and influenced
by matters of public policy. The
successful invocation of legal unreasonableness is rare and the more recent
developments in this
field do not necessarily encourage any greater frequency in
relation to policy determinations, even allowing for the fact that this
of review now has broader operation in relation to the decisions of tribunals.
There was in this case no failure on the part
of the responsible Minister to
consider a mandatory consideration. At the other end of the process, it cannot
be said that this particular
outcome was unreasonable in the sense that it fell
outside the boundaries of the responsible Minister’s decisional freedom.
There was an evident and intelligible justification for the adoption of the new
framework represented in the Determinations, even
allowing for the fact that it
might be legitimately criticised on policy grounds or that another reasonable
decision-maker might
have come to a different result.
adoption of a uniform cost-based model for the fixing of rent for remote social
housing was plainly justifiable by reference
to the principles that underpinned
the assessment of the various options and models which were considered. The fact
that administrative
convenience and ease of implementation formed part of that
justification did not render the determination in any sense unreasonable,
illogical or irrational. Nor does the fact that the application of a cost-based
model to a class which may include members with different
salient features
necessarily lead to a conclusion of legal irrationality in the context of a
social housing program. Almost any determination
made with reference to a class
will be susceptible to that criticism, because a class by its very nature
involves a grouping by reference
to a particular standard which in real life
application will fall short of uniformity. To say that too much weight was
accorded to
the cost of public housing and insufficient weight accorded to the
particular amenity of each dwelling and the circumstance of each
tenant invites
the review court to conduct a merits-based review and usurp the
decision-maker’s policy and operational function.
In this particular
context, that intervention would only be warranted if it could be concluded that
the Determinations were antithetical
to the ‘public interest sought to be
protected and enhanced’ by the statutory scheme, which they were not. That
does not follow from the fact that the Determinations adopted a
cost-based model on policy and political grounds rather than by reference
individual tenants and premises.
[159] For these
reasons, this ground of appeal is also dismissed.
The reference
in 2023-01110-SC
[160] As stated
at the outset, the second matter to be determined is an adjunct to the appeal
from the decision of the trial judge.
It is an application for judicial review
seeking, amongst other relief, a declaration that the fourth Determination of
Rent Payable
for Dwellings dated 1 February 2023 made in purported pursuance of
Housing Act
ultra vires
by operation of
of the RTA and cl 2(2) of Sch 2 of the RT Regulations. It
raises the same issues as have been determined above for the purpose of
appeal, and attracts the same findings.
The application for leave
to appeal in 2023-01346-SC
[161] The third
matter to be determined is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of
the NTCAT made on 29 March
The substance of the
decision is that NTCAT lacks jurisdiction to determine applications made by the
applicants (as tenants) for
declarations under s 42 of the RTA. That
section provides:
Tribunal may declare rent excessive
(1) The Tribunal may, on the application of the tenant, declare that the
rent payable under a tenancy agreement is excessive.
(2) The Tribunal must not make a declaration under subsection (1) unless
(a) has given 14 days notice to the landlord of the application; and
(b) has invited the landlord to make submissions to the Tribunal in relation to
the application before the date specified in the
notice; and
(c) has considered any submissions made by the landlord.
(3) The Tribunal may only make a declaration under subsection (1) if the rent
paid in respect of the tenancy agreement is, in the
opinion of the Tribunal,
(a) having regard to the general level of rents for comparable premises in the
same or similar localities and the cost of any services
provided in connection
with the tenancy agreement by the landlord or the tenant; or
(b) because the level of services provided under the agreement has, in the
opinion of the Tribunal, been reduced to a significant
extent, having regard to
the cost of any services provided in connection with the tenancy agreement by
the landlord or the tenant.
(4) If the Tribunal makes a declaration under subsection (1), it may by
(a) specify the rent payable for the premises and vary the agreement by reducing
the rent payable under the agreement accordingly;
(b) specify a date (which is not to be before the date of the application) from
which the variation takes effect; and
(c) specify the period of not more than 12 months that the order is to remain in
(5) The Tribunal may, on the application of the landlord, vary or revoke an
order under this section as the Tribunal thinks fit.
[162] The matter
proceeded on the agreed position that s 7(5) of the RTA does not exclude
the application of s 42 of the RTA, on the
basis that none of the tenancy
arrangements in question are ‘a tenancy or proposed tenancy under the
Housing Act 1982
’. That is because the term ‘tenancy under
Housing Act
’ was at the material time defined in
the RTA not to include a tenancy relating to premises not owned by the Territory
or a statutory authority, unless the landlord

issue for determination was whether the NTCAT was precluded from making an order
of the RTA where rent for a dwelling has been set by the
Minister pursuant to

determined that
of the RTA had application to ‘rent payable
under a tenancy agreement’, and that descriptor did not extend to rent

review of the Minister’s determination, in circumstances where the NTCAT

, Division 3 of the
Northern Territory Civil and
Administrative Tribunal Act 2014
(NT), and any declaration made by the NTCAT
would have no legal force having regard to the operation of
Housing Act
. That decision was necessarily made on the premise that the
Determinations made under
Housing Act
were valid.
[164] The appeal
for which the applicants seek leave to prosecute is an appeal restricted to a
question of law. The ordinary principles
which govern an appeal of that nature
have application. The proposition that an appeal of this nature is somehow
equivalent to an
application for judicial review should not be
except in the
limited sense that jurisdictional errors of law may be amenable to judicial
review. However, the question whether the
NTCAT was precluded from making an
order under
of the RTA where rent for a dwelling has been set by
the Minister pursuant to
Housing Act
is ultimately
one of law.
[165] In seeking
to establish error of law on the part of the NTCAT, the applicants submit that
on existing appellate authority the
Tribunal’s power in
the RTA in relation to ‘the rent payable under a tenancy agreement’
is properly construed to mean rent a tenant has
a legally enforceable obligation
to pay by virtue of, pursuant to or under the authority of an agreement to
occupy premises.
legislature chose that formulation rather than, for example, ‘rent payable
in accordance with a tenancy agreement’.
The formulation selected by the
legislature is said to implicate the tenancy agreement as the source of the
obligation to pay rent,
rather than the means by which the quantum of rent is
calculated. The applicants seek to illustrate that principle by reference to
circumstances of the first and second applicants, whose tenancy agreements were
silent as to the rent rate. Despite that, each
of them paid rent at a rate later
agreed with the Chief Executive Officer (Housing). Those payments were properly
characterised as
‘rent payable under a tenancy agreement’ because
the agreement remained the source of the obligation to pay.
conclusion that
of the RTA operates in relation to the
applicants’ tenancy agreements is said by the appellants to be reinforced
by the fact
that at the material times
Housing Act
expressly provided that the RTA applies to and in relation to premises let under
Housing Act
, subject only to the exceptions and exemptions in
of the RTA. The applicants say that conclusion is further
reinforced by the fact that
Housing Act
overrides rent determined by way of any agreement or arrangement ‘between
the tenant of the dwelling and any other person’.
A declaration of the
NTCAT under
of the RTA does not satisfy the description
‘agreement or arrangement’, and the Tribunal is not a

operation of
of the RTA, by which the NTCAT may couple a
declaration with an order specifying the rent payable, because a declaration

Housing Act
as originally enacted empowered and required the
Minister to determine the rent to be paid for each dwelling to be let under the
Housing Act
subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister deemed
fit. Under the previous housing legislation, rents were based on the actual
of constructing and maintaining dwellings. The purpose underlying the enactment
Housing Act
was to vest the responsible Minister with
what was described in the course of the parliamentary debates as ‘complete
discretionary
powers in the matter of rental determination’. The purpose
of vesting that power was to require the Housing Commission to comply
intergovernmental funding agreements and ‘purely Northern Territory policy
initiatives’. The power was subsequently
amended in 1987 to make it clear
that the responsible Minister could also in the exercise of that power make
determinations for a
class of dwellings.
Housing Act
was re-enacted in substantially its present form in 2000. There is nothing
in that re-enactment which suggests that the legislative
intention was to
displace the conferral of complete discretionary powers on the Minister in the
matter of rental determination. Rather,
the enactment of
Housing Act
at the same time made it plain that the responsible
Minister’s determination was to prevail over any tenancy or other form of
Housing Act
relevantly provided that, with certain exceptions and
express disapplications, the RTA ‘applies in relation to premises let
Housing Act
]’. So far as the sequence of enactment is
concerned, the RTA commenced operation on 1 March 2000 and
Housing Act
was repealed and re-enacted from that same date so that it
made reference to the RTA rather than the former tenancies legislation.
Housing Act
was then further repealed and re-enacted with
effect from 31 January 2001 with the express purpose of making it clear that a
determination
under that section prevailed as the terms of a tenancy agreement.
Housing Act
is not determinative of this issue. The operative
question is whether the powers of the NTCAT under
are engaged in
relation to a Ministerial determination under
. Although the legislative scheme in this respect is lacking in clarity,
we cannot accede to the submission that a coherent reading
of the scheme created
by the two pieces of legislation leads to the conclusion that the NTCAT has
power to strike down a determination
made by the Minister with responsibility
for social housing of the rent payable for social housing dwellings.
arriving at that result, it is unnecessary for
to provide expressly that a determination made under that provision
overrides or is not amenable to a determination of the NTCAT
pursuant to
of the RTA.
of the RTA is concerned with the modification
of tenancy agreements in circumstances where the rent payable is excessive
having regard
to market considerations. That is a very different field of
operation to
Housing Act
, which provides for the fixing
of rents for social housing schemes. Such a determination is necessarily based
upon a multiplicity
of considerations which are not amenable to a form of merits
review by a quasi-judicial tribunal in the same manner as a market-based
residential leasing arrangement would be. That anomaly is reflected in the fact
that the declarations and orders sought by the applicants
included that the rent
determined by the responsible Minister is excessive and that the rent to be paid
should reflect the ‘market
value’ of the premises. The provision of
social housing is the antithesis of a market-based system.
[171] The fact
that the power in
of the RTA is conferred in relation to ‘the
rent payable under a tenancy agreement’ is not determinative of the issue.
The meaning and effect of the word ‘under’ must be determined having
regard to the particular legislative scheme in question
and the subject matter
of the inquiry. Depending upon the context, ‘by’ and
‘under’ are commonly used to
mean ‘in accordance with’,
‘pursuant to’ or ‘covered
When considered in
that light, the contrast sought to be drawn by the appellants between
‘rent payable under a tenancy agreement’
and ‘rent payable in
accordance with a tenancy agreement’ is of little moment.
of the RTA is directed to the level or amount of the rent payable. It is not
primarily concerned with the fact that rent is payable
or the source of the
legally enforceable obligation to pay that rent. To say that the tenancy
agreement is the source of the legal
obligation does not lead inexorably to the
conclusion that
of the RTA has application to rents determined by the
Minister pursuant to
Housing Act
, or that such a
determination does not itself give rise to a legal obligation on the part of a
person occupying premises subject
to such a determination. The seminal source of
the obligation is the determination rather than the tenancy agreement, and
Housing Act
provides that rent in accordance with
that determination is to be paid despite anything to the contrary in (or under)
the tenancy
agreement. It is not to the point that in the absence of a
declaration under
Housing Act
the source of the
obligation to pay rent will lie elsewhere.
conclusion receives some textual support from
and (5) of the RTA.
Those provisions confer procedural rights only on a ‘landlord’ in
relation to an application and
order made under
of the RTA. For the
reasons already given in the context of the appeal in proceeding AP 13/22
(2237775), it is the Minister who makes
the determination of rent under
Housing Act
but it is the Chief Executive Officer
(Housing) who is the ‘landlord’ in the relevant sense under the
legislative scheme.
That tells against any construction which would bring
determinations by the Minister within the ambit of
of the RTA while
denying the procedural rights otherwise available under the provision.
[174] The fact
that a bare declaration under
of the RTA need not be coupled with
an order specifying the rent payable does not lead to the conclusion that there
is no conflict
between the power reposited in the NTCAT to declare rent
excessive and the singular power of the responsible Minister to fix the
be paid for a dwelling or a class of dwelling in a social housing scheme. Even
allowing for the ordinary presumption that
the Crown will act consistently with
a declaration without need for a coercive order, the effect of the declaration
is still to override
the Minister’s determination. That inconsistency is
not obviated by the fact that the NTCAT has power to make an order varying
tenancy agreement to reduce the rent payable under that agreement. In any event,
whatever speculation there might be about the
NTCAT making a declaration and
adjourning the proceedings to allow the parties opportunity to reach agreement
as to the appropriate
rent, the reality is that in the absence of an order a
declaration by itself does not specify how much the rent should be in a manner
which would allow the parties to give effect to or comply with the NTCAT
determination. It is for that very reason that the appellants’
relief in the proceedings before the NTCAT included an application for an order
specifying the rent payable.
[175] There is a
particular aspect of the potential conflict between a declaration and order
pursuant to
of the RTA and the operation of a determination under
Housing Act
. Until 2018,
(6) of the RTA
provided that it was an offence for a landlord to ask for or receive rent
exceeding the amount fixed by an order made
That provision
was repealed with effect from 1 July 2018 on the basis that
Northern Territory Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2014
created the offence of failing to comply with an order of the NTCAT. That gives
rise to a situation in which in the face of
an order under
RTA having application to a determination under
, the Chief Executive Officer (Housing) would be placed in the invidious
position of having to ignore the direction of the responsible
Minister in order
to avoid criminal liability. It would seem unlikely that the legislature
intended the scheme to have that operation.
[176] The review
by the NTCAT of rent payable for social housing premises pursuant to a
Ministerial determination would, contrary
to the appellants’ submissions,
permit something in the nature of a merits review of the Minister’s
determination. In
order to make a declaration in those terms, the NTCAT would
need to form the opinion on the basis of evidence that the rent is excessive
having regard to the general level of rents for comparable premises in the same
or similar localities and the cost of services provided
by the landlord in
connection with the tenancy agreement; or because the level of services provided
under the tenancy agreement has
been reduced to a significant extent having
regard to the cost of the services provided in connection with the tenancy
It would be impossible in the present circumstances to make either of
those determinations without gainsaying the Minister’s
determination as to
the rent properly payable for social housing premises, and the policy basis on
which that rent is properly determined,
including in remote communities. That
reality is not altered by the fact that the NTCAT is not ‘standing in the
shoes of the
decision-maker’ in terms of making the same type of decision,
or that the NTCAT determination is made in respect of an individual
rather than a class of dwellings.
[177] Contrary
to the appellants’ submissions, the exercise of the two powers are quite
incompatible. Rather than providing
a ‘protective backstop’ to the
operation of a determination under
Housing Act
application of
of the RTA to such determinations would bring into play
limitations and market-based considerations which do not find voice in the
Housing Act
. There is, in any event, no correlation
between the general level of rents for comparable premises in the same or
similar localities
and a social housing tenant’s financial circumstances.
To take the present circumstances by way of example, a declaration on
could only be made in the application of a factor principle approach, which
would undermine the operational cost model
reflected in the Minister’s
determination. Similarly, any application on the basis that the level of
services provided under
the tenancy agreement had been reduced could only be
directed to the issue of non-compliance by the landlord in relation to
habitability
obligations. The question of non-compliance by landlord is a matter
which is addressed under quite different mechanisms of the RTA,
including the
power to order compensation for breach, rather than one which is properly
addressed under
of the RTA.
[178] In this
matter, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal
Disposition
[179] For these
reasons, the appeal in proceeding AP 13/22 (2237775) should be dismissed, and
the same consequence follows in relation
to the application for judicial review
of the Fourth Determination the subject of proceeding 2023-01110-SC. In
proceeding 2023-01346-SC
we have determined that leave to appeal should be
granted and the appeal dismissed. We will hear the parties in relation to the
form of the orders which should be made consequent upon those findings,
and as to costs.

obliges the Minister administering that Act to consult with potentially affected
persons before exempting certain classes
of tenancy agreements from all or any

submits that the
responsible Minister was able, and in fact obliged, to afford
procedural fairness in the same manner, those obligations arise under
different statute and attach to a different Minister. Had the legislature
intended a similar procedural requirement should apply

, similar provision could have been made.
