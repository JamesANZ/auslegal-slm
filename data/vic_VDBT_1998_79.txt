HIH WINTERHUR
CASUAL AND GENERAL INSURANCE LIMITED

REASONS FOR RULING
The Applicant in this proceeding who is represented by Mr Settle of Counsel
has made an application by Summons dated 18 December 1997
to join, HIH
Winterthur Casualty and General Insurance Ltd ("HIH") the Respondent builders
insurer and as an additional Respondent
pursuant to s56 of the Domestic Building
Contracts and Tribunal Act 1995 ("the Act").
The Applicant took the somewhat unusual course in this proceeding of serving
HIH with notice of the application and as a consequence
of which HIH appeared
and was represented by Ms Pettigrew of Counsel. No question of leave to appear
was raised and the proceeding
was dealt with on the basis that such leave was
assumed by all parties. No doubt this procedure was adopted with a view to
unnecessary delay to the proceeding and to reduce the number of
preliminary hearings. Indeed I believe the course taken probably
has achieved
that objective. In any event both the Respondent builder represented by Mr
Schwarz of Counsel and HIH opposed the application.
Mr Schwarz contended that HIH would have no part to play in the hearing, and
that no issue could arise between the owner and HIH until
a determination had
been made in the dispute between the the owner and builder. It was common
ground that no claim had been made
at this point upon HIH by the builder and it
would also appear that at this point of time the Owner has no right to make any
upon the HIH seeking an indemnity or compensation for the cost of
rectifying the allegedly defective work. Ms Pettigrew submitted
that HIH was
not in the circumstances a necessary or proper party and having regard to the
various decisions that have already been
made to the Tribunal in relation to the
operation of s56 of the Act an order for joinder should not be made (see
Gunther v HGFL & ors
(Judge Davey 22 August 1997 and
Zettl V Jolin
Holdings and anor
(Dr Cremean 12 March 1997). It was conceded by all
parties that s63 the other section permitting orders for joinder of additional
parties can only operate in a proceeding seeking a review of an insurer’s
decision and does not apply in the present circumstances.
Although the policy
of insurance in this case was not exhibited it was conceded that the policy was
an annual builders’ policy
and the builder was the only insured party
although the policy was also expressed to be for the benefit of the owner. This
of policy would (in any event) appear to provide little scope for s61 of
the Act to have any operation.
I indicated to the parties at the end of submissions that I had come to the
conclusion that in the present circumstances the insurer
should not be joined
even though s56 mentions "insurer" as one of the classes of persons who may be
joined by the Tribunal as additional
parties to a proceeding. In my view HIH
was not a person having a sufficiently proximate interest in these
proceedings.
One purpose of providing written reasons for my ruling in this case is that
it would appear that the new system of insurance has created
a degree of
confusion and it may be beneficial to attempt to throw some light on the
The amendments that were made to the
Building Act 1993
which were introduced
as part of the Act resulted in the Government sponsored approved guarantee
system which was formerly provided
to registered builders carrying out domestic
building work being replaced by a regulated private insurance scheme. The
former scheme
was administered by the House Contracts Guarantee Fund Ltd ("the
Fund"). Because initially the Fund heard and determined disputes
builders and owners internally by setting up its own appeal procedure from the
Fund’s initial decision, the Fund was
normally directly involved in
disputes between owners and builders and it was a party to such disputes when
the Appeal Committee’s
decisions were appealed to the AAT.
Building Act 1993
introduced a new system of insurance for domestic
building practitioners. In addition
empowered the Minister to publish an
order requiring building practitioners carrying out domestic building work to be
specified insurance and sets out a number of terms and conditions
that must be included in such insurance contracts. A ministerial
order was made
on 1 October 1996 specifying two different types of policies of insurance. The
first type of policy was a policy
issued in the name of the builder and second
in the name of the owner, the latter being a policy limited to a specified
project ("project policy") and the former being an annual policy
covering all domestic building projects commenced by the builder
in the relevant
insurance period. Each of the policies provide an indemnity to the building
owner. However, where the policy is
in the name of the builder it must include
a clause requiring the insurer "to comply with any order made by the Domestic
Tribunal against the insured in respect of risks otherwise covered by
the policy upon default by the insured (the builder) in complying
with such an
order." The ministerial order goes on to provide that in the event of conflict
between the ministerial order and the
terms of a policy then the ministerial
order prevails.
It is clear from the ministerial order and from the standard HIH policy a
copy of which appears in "Domestic Building Building Legislation
& Practices" by Pamela Jenkins that with that type of policy the owner has
no entitlement to make a claim on the insurer
except in very limited
circumstances which have not arisen in the present case. However in the event
of the Tribunal making an order
against a builder then the insurer, in the event
of the builder defaulting, is under an obligation to indemnify the owner. It is
true that the insurer in limited circumstances may be entitled to rely on
Insurance Contracts Act 1984
and seek to avoid its liability to indemnify
the owner but it does not appear that it would have any entitlement to go behind
decision of the Tribunal. This is particularly so in the present case where
the insurer has now successfully argued before the Tribunal
that it should not
be joined in the present proceedings between the owner and builder. The
position may well be otherwise when a
policy has been procured in the name of
the owner. The situation in that case would appear to be much more closely
analogous to
that which formerly existed under the House Contracts Guarantee
Act. That situation is not this case. It would be inappropriate
for me by this
ruling to express any opinion in those circumstances on the appropriateness of
otherwise of joining the insurer as
On the basis of the above analysis it seems clear that no useful purpose
would be served in joining HIH as a party to this proceeding.
Accordingly the
application to join HIH is dismissed.
Both HIH and the builder made an application for an order for costs against
the builder in respect of this summons. My powers to
award costs are of course
limited by the provisions in the Act. S92 does give a Member limited power to
award costs on an interlocutory
basis. However costs under s92 may only be
awarded where the Member is satisfied that the proceedings have been conducted
that unnecessarily disadvantages another party. I am not satisfied
that s92 applies in the present circumstances. S93 only empowers
the Tribunal
to award costs at the end of a proceeding. I am not satisfied that an
application to join an additional party under
s56 can properly be regarded as a
proceeding. In the circumstances therefore I propose to reserve the question of
costs to the presiding
member who ultimately hears this claim. There appears to
be no reason why the builder should not be entitled to an award of moderate
costs based on the scale appropriate to the quantum claimed. However this must
be a matter ultimately for the discretion of the
presiding member. There is
another matter however which was raised by Mr Settle. Technically HIH has never
become a party to the
proceeding. In those circumstances I am unable to see how
any costs can be awarded in its favour. If HIH had been joined as a party
then sought to have itself struck out it would of course have been potentially
entitled to costs at the conclusion of the proceeding
against it. For these
reasons I do not propose to reserve the costs of HIH but only the costs of the
