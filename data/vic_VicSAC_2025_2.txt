Sentencing Younger Children’s Offending in Victoria
Acknowledgement of Country

dual aims of this report are to investigate cases sentenced in Victoria
offences by
aged 10 to 11
, to understand the types of cases that will no
longer have a sentencing response once the age of criminal responsibility has
raised to 12 years old, and to inform the development of an alternative
services model for those children; and

, to better
understand offending by, and sentencing of, those who will now be in the
youngest age group that can be sentenced in Victoria,
and to consider how the
provisions of the
Youth Justice Act 2024
(Vic) might operate in
responding to their offending.
We analysed court data for all cases sentenced in
Victoria’s criminal courts between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2021 (10 years)
where at least one charge in the case was committed when the person was aged 10
to 11, aged 12 or aged 13. The reference period ended
on 30 June 2021 because
later data was not available when the analysis for this project was undertaken
due to some unintended consequences
Spent Convictions Act 2021
For each case, we examined children’s age and gender, their offence
earliest offence in
the case and sentencing. Our analysis included cases finalised in the
Magistrates’ Court and County Court;
however, our primary focus was cases
finalised in the Children’s Court, where 98% of cases involving offences
by younger children
were sentenced or diverted. No offences by children aged 10
to 13 were sentenced in the Supreme Court in the 10-year period.
Key findings
The findings in this report are consistent with other
research on younger children (aged 10 to 13) who offend. Sentenced younger
are more likely than sentenced older children to be male, most
sentenced younger children are aged 13 (not younger), and Aboriginal
and children living in rural and regional Victoria are disproportionately
represented among sentenced younger children.
What the findings in this report also show are that younger children make up
a very small proportion of sentenced offenders (0.3%);
for most children aged 10
to 13, more than half a year passes between their earliest offence and
sentencing; and the group is not
homogenous – 13-year-olds offend more
prolifically and more seriously than 12-year-olds do. In terms of sentencing
only a very small fraction of younger children who offend ever receive
a custodial sentence (0.3% of alleged offenders, and 2.6%
of sentenced younger
children), with the vast majority receiving less severe outcomes, such as
diversion and good behaviour bonds.
This report also identified 55 cases involving offending by younger children
that were sentenced in the adult jurisdiction (Magistrates’
County Court) years, if not decades, after the offending. In many of those
cases, the court commented on the difficulty
of sentencing an adult for offences
committed aged 10 to 13.
Introduction
Across Australia, the
approach to problematic behaviour by the youngest children – those who
offend aged under 14 – has
been of significant interest in recent years.
In the Victorian context, a suite of reforms in the new
Youth Justice Act
Youth Justice
substantially changes the
approach to this cohort of children. Reforms in the
Youth Justice Act
raising the age
of criminal responsibility from 10 (where it has remained for decades) to 12
(section 10)
, with an alternative services model under development for children
aged 10 and aged 11; and
reshaping the
approach to children aged 12 or aged 13, including:

apply to children aged 12 or aged 13
(section 11)
out the matters to which police must have regard in deciding whether to charge a
child aged 12 or aged 13
(section 12)
and providing for the review of such
charges by the prosecutor if a summary proceeding is commenced in the
Children’s Court
(section 14)
out a hierarchy of options, including pre-court diversionary options that do not
lead to criminal prosecution
(section 92)
introducing
early diversion group conferences
(sections 116
established process which aims to divert eligible children out of the criminal
justice system before charges are
a mandatory obligation for police to refer a child aged under 14 to an early
diversion group conference if satisfied that
there is sufficient evidence to
charge the child, and other diversionary responses further up the hierarchy
(such as a police caution)
are ‘clearly inappropriate in the
circumstances’
(section 117).
This report is
intended to contribute to the evidence base that informs the implementation of
the above changes. The dual aims of
this report are to:
examine cases
involving offending by children aged 10 to 11, to better understand the
offending behaviour that will no longer have
a sentencing response once the age
of criminal responsibility is raised to 12 years old. The findings in relation
to children aged
10 to 11 are intended to assist with the continued
implementation of the alternative services model; and
examine cases
involving offending by children aged 12 and aged 13, who, once
Youth Justice Act
commences, will comprise the youngest age group
eligible to be charged, prosecuted and, if found guilty, sentenced in Victoria.
Understanding
the profiles of children aged 12 and aged 13 is intended to inform
the implementation of the new
Youth Justice Act
, and act as a baseline
for monitoring the Act’s operation.
This report discusses each
key age group separately, examining all cases in Victoria involving children who
offended aged 10 to 11,
aged 12 or aged 13 and were sentenced or diverted in the
10 years from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2021. The report includes data from
courts – primarily the Children’s Court but also some cases in the
adult jurisdiction (Magistrates’ Court and
County Court, with no Supreme
Court cases involving offences by children in these age
The reference period ended
on 30 June 2021 because the Council was unable to access certain court data for
a period of time (as an
unintended consequence of the
Spent Convictions Act
(Vic)), and as a result later data was not available when the analysis
for this project was undertaken.
The report includes people who offended aged 10 to 13 but were sentenced as
adults, sometimes decades after the offending. In this
report, children aged 10
to 11, aged 12 or aged 13 at the time of their offending are collectively
referred to as
younger children
, reflecting their status as the youngest
children in the justice system during the 10-year reference period. At times we

. However, we
know that people sometimes are not sentenced until considerable time has passed
after their offending. This can be for
numerous reasons: the time to identify
and charge younger children; the time to obtain legal representation and ensure
other necessary
legal safeguards are put in place; the time to consolidate cases
when a child has multiple charges; difficulties in obtaining instructions

In the context of sex offences, sometimes reporting does not occur until

From a sentencing
perspective, the passage of time between offending and prosecution can make the
sentencing exercise particularly
difficult, especially in the handful of cases
where children who offended aged 10 to 13 were not sentenced until decades after
offending, requiring their case to be heard in the adult jurisdiction.
Focusing on age at sentencing risks omitting people such as
these from the study
of younger children’s offending.
In this report, therefore, we have changed our usual focus from age at
. By focusing on the age at which
children committed their offence, we have been able to produce one of the first
reports in Victoria
to provide a comprehensive overview of both offending by and
sentencing of the youngest children in the Victorian justice system.
As a caveat to the data discussed in this report, younger children in the
criminal justice system are mostly dealt with by police
(for example, by police
cautions), with only around 1 in 10 ultimately sentenced or diverted in
This report examines the
1 in 10 cases involving offences by younger children that are prosecuted and
sentenced (or diverted in court).
For children who offend aged 10 to 11,
understanding the nature and volume of sentenced offending will assist in
designing responses
to these behaviours now that the age of criminal
responsibility has been raised. Similarly, the new
Youth Justice Act
makes considerable changes to the way in which children aged 12 and aged 13
will be dealt with for alleged criminal behaviour. Examining
the sentenced
offending of children aged 12 and aged 13 in the period before the new
Justice Act
commences operation provides an important baseline for the
future examination of the effectiveness of the new measures for the youngest
children who are eligible to be sentenced under the new Act.
Legal framework for sentencing younger children
Most children who face court for offending behaviour
are sentenced in the Children’s Court. The parameters around sentencing
younger children include the following:
minimum age of criminal responsibility
during the 10-year reference
period, the age of criminal responsibility was 10 years
with children aged 10 and
older able to be prosecuted for their behaviour, subject to the principle of
doli incapax
. The age of criminal responsibility has since been raised to
12 years old.
Once the provision
raising the age commences,
children younger than 12 will no longer be able to be prosecuted.
doli incapax
legal principle that translates as
‘incapable of deceit’. Children below the age of criminal
responsibility (previously
10, now 12) are
; in other words, they are seen as incapable of forming the necessary
criminal intent and cannot be prosecuted for their actions.
Children at or above
the age of criminal responsibility but aged under 14 are
doli incapax
. That is, they are presumed to be incapable of crime unless
the prosecution successfully rebuts the presumption by pointing ‘to
evidence from which an inference can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt that the
child’s development is such that he or she knew
that it was morally wrong
to engage in the conduct’, as opposed to the child being naughty or
mischievous.
Particularly
relevant to the youngest children in the youth justice system is the question of
morality, which ‘directs attention
to the child’s education and the
environment in which the child has been raised’ as well as ‘the
intellectual and
moral development of the particular
‘The rationale for the presumption of

view that a child aged under 14 years is not sufficiently intellectually and
morally developed to appreciate the difference
between right and wrong ... the
presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the child knew that it was morally
wrong to engage in
the conduct that constitutes the physical element or elements
of the offence.’

pathway for children who exhibit sexually abusive behaviour

Court for children who exhibit sexually

If the Family Division
makes a therapeutic treatment order, the Criminal Division must adjourn the
criminal proceedings to enable
the child to complete the program (providing that
the Criminal Division has ‘not yet made a finding in the criminal
proceedings’).
‘satisfied that the child has attended and participated in the therapeutic
treatment program’, the Criminal Division
must ‘discharge the child
without any further hearing of the criminal
proceedings’.
Therapeutic
treatment orders were available for children up to the age of 14 before 29 March
2019 and are available for children
up to the age of 17
thereafter.

offences by children aged 10 to 13 usually do not appear on
their criminal record – a conviction imposed on a person for an
committed aged under 15 is considered
‘if a court imposes a penalty with a condition attached for the
conviction’, the offender must complete all
conditions attached to the
penalty before the conviction becomes spent, regardless of their age at the time
of offending.
What do we know about younger children in the justice
There is a significant
body of research in Australia about children who are alleged to have committed
criminal offences. Most of that
research, however, examines
(aged 10 to 17). There is relatively limited research that exclusively focuses
on – or even separately examines –
the offending of younger children
(those aged 10 to 13). Given the policy significance of this distinct age group,
it is important
to analyse younger children separately, as done in our previous
research on youth reoffending and on ‘crossover children’
with dual justice system and child protection
involvement).
Recent research by us and others that has focused on the youngest children in
the justice system suggests that:
children are
more likely to be a victim
of a serious offence (such as
murder, an assault resulting in hospitalisation, or a sexual assault) than to be
a perpetrator of such
younger children do offend, their most common offence types are
(such as theft) and
offences against the person
example, a study by Baidawi et al. of 1,369 children aged 10 to 13 who allegedly
offended in 2017 (272 of whom ultimately came
before the Children’s Court)
found that property offences and offences against the person constituted 59.6%
and 28.9%, respectively,
of their alleged
children are
rarely perpetrators of the most serious crimes
recent study by Flannery et al. found that in the five years to 30 June 2022,
107 Victorian children aged 10 to 13 committed ‘serious
Further, in the
past 25 years there hasn’t been a single child in Victoria sentenced for a
murder or manslaughter charge committed
when the child was aged under 14 (or at
age 14 for that matter);
children who offend are a particularly vulnerable group, for example, most are
known to child protection
. We previously found that 54% of children first
sentenced aged 10 to 13 were the subject of at least one child protection
33% had experienced out-of-home care, and 26% had experienced
residential care;
younger children who offend have
experienced or witnessed family
The Baidawi et al. study of 1,369 alleged younger offenders
found that 659 children (48.1%) had a prior intervention order in which
were the protected person.
our study of children with dual child protection and justice involvement found
that over 80% of children with dual involvement
who were first sentenced or
diverted aged 10 to 13 were the subject of a report raising concerns about
physical harm to them;
children are overrepresented
among younger children in the justice
For example, in Freeman
and Donnelly’s recent study of New South Wales children aged 10 to 13 with
legal proceedings against
them by the New South Wales police force, the
proportion of Aboriginal children among those with finalised proceedings in 2023
six times higher than the proportion of Aboriginal children in the general
population;
from rural and regional Victoria are overrepresented
among justice-involved
younger children. For instance, we previously found that 5% of children
sentenced in metropolitan courts were
aged 10 to 13, but that increased to 15%
of children sentenced in regional
younger children who offend
are 13 years old
when they commit their
offence. For instance, the Baidawi et al. study of 1,369 alleged younger
offenders found that 63.3% were aged

Baidawi and Piquero’s 2021 study of
children with dual youth justice and
child protection involvement found that almost ‘one-half ... had a
neurodisability’
and that this group tended to be younger at first offence
than dual-involved children without a
neurodisability;
younger children who offend are
disengaged from education
instance, the Baidawi et al. study of 1,369 alleged younger offenders found that
48.8% of children aged 10 to 13 undergoing
doli incapax
assessments were
not engaged in education (with one-quarter of children not
younger children with alleged offences
don’t go to court
Crime Statistics Agency data shows that only 9% of alleged offenders aged 10
to 13 in the six financial years to 30 June 2023 were
dealt with through the
sentencing process (including Children’s Court youth
) (Figure 1). And the
Baidawi et al. study of 1,369 alleged younger offenders found that only 19.8%
had their matter finalised in
court (including cases where the matter was struck
out or dismissed and cases that resulted in youth
diversion);
younger children who do have their charges finalised in court, often a
substantial amount of time passes between their offending and sentencing
For example, the Baidawi et al. study examined 272 children aged 10 to 13 who
appeared in court in 2017 for alleged offending, and
found that the average time
from the alleged offence to a court outcome was 406 days for children whose
offence was struck out due
doli incapax
, 337 days for children whose
offence was struck out for other reasons, 255 days for children sentenced to a
probation order or youth
supervision order, and 249 days for children who
received youth diversion;
sentenced for offences aged 10 to 13 are more likely than older children to
remain in the justice system
. Our youth reoffending research found that the
younger children are when first sentenced or diverted in court, the more likely
are to ‘reoffend generally, reoffend violently, continue offending
into the adult jurisdiction, and be sentenced to an adult

(less than 1% of alleged younger offenders – see

Prevalence of younger children in sentenced cases
This section places
offending by younger children in context, examining their cases:
as a proportion
of all sentenced or diverted cases;
over time to see
if the number of cases each year is changing; and
Younger children are responsible for only 0.32% of sentenced
In the 10 years to 30 June 2021, almost one million
cases were sentenced or diverted in Victoria, involving people of all ages (as
well as corporations). Only 0.02% of all cases included at least one offence
committed by a child aged 10 to 11 at their offence
(222 cases across the 10
years) (Figure 2), and children aged 12 or aged 13 at their offence were
responsible for only 0.08% and
0.25% of cases, respectively (697 and 2,302
cases). Overall, only 0.32% of sentenced or diverted cases in the 10 years to 30
2021 included an offence by a child aged 10 to 13 (2,949 of 927,514 cases).

These findings, together with other recent research and analysis, show that,
as younger children progress through the justice system,
they make up a
progressively smaller proportion of the total justice system population. The
Crime Statistics Agency Victoria found
that children aged 10 to 13 were
responsible for a very small proportion of
alleged offender incidents
in the 10 years to 30 June
This is generally
consistent across Australia, with younger children representing only a tiny
fraction of alleged offenders.
By the sentencing stage, we found that younger children were responsible for
only 0.32% of all sentenced or diverted cases finalised
in Victorian courts in
the 10 years to 30 June 2021. This decrease (from 1% of alleged offender
incidents to 0.32% of all sentenced
or diverted cases) most likely reflects the
approach to younger children in the justice system, including the greater use of
diversionary
initiatives (such as cautioning) and the applicable legal
framework, especially the presumption of
doli incapax
. As Figure 1 shows,
most younger children who had contact with police in Victoria do not progress
into the court system. Only 28%
of younger children with alleged offences were
charged (1,816), and even fewer (less than 1 in 10) were ultimately sentenced in
(609 of 6,541 alleged younger offenders). Instead, more than half of
children aged 10 to 13 received a police caution (54%) and 18%
received another
police outcome, such as a penalty infringement
The number of sentenced cases involving younger children is
As well as amounting to a very small proportion of
sentenced or diverted cases in the 10 years to 30 June 2021, the annual
of sentenced or diverted cases involving younger children
decreased substantially over that time period (Figure
In 2011–12, there were
452 sentenced or diverted cases with at least one offence by a child aged 10 to

Some of the decrease in the two most recent years of our reference period may
be due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s
policing practices and court operations. But even prior to the pandemic, the
number of sentenced or diverted cases involving
younger children more than
halved between 2011–12 and 2018–19. This finding contrasts with the
Queensland Sentencing
Advisory Council’s finding that the number of
sentenced cases involving children aged 10 to 13 steadily

The decrease in
sentenced or diverted cases
involving younger children
in Victoria outpaced the decline in the number of
offenders who came into contact with police, the latter dropping from 1,760 in
2012–13 to 1,267 in 2021–22 (a
This suggests that
one of the reasons for the decrease in sentenced or diverted younger children is
an increase in the use of police
diversionary options, such as police cautions.
The use of police cautions for younger children was fairly consistent for most
the 10 years to 30 June 2022. However, in the last year there was a notable
increase in the number of children aged 10 to 13 receiving
cautions (from 53% in
2020–21 to 67% in 2021–22) and a decrease in the number of children
aged 10 to 13 being charged
by police (from 27% in 2020–21 to 15% in
The decrease in sentenced or diverted cases was also noticeable in each
separate age category. For example, the number of sentenced
or diverted cases
decreased for children with at least one charge aged 13: from 339 in
2011–12 to 185 in 2018–19 and
falling further to 81 in 2020–21
(during the pandemic). A downward trend was also apparent for both male and
female children:
an 81% decline (from 345 to 67) in the number of boys sentenced
or diverted each year for offending committed when aged 10 to 13,
decline (from 107 to 26) in the number of girls.
There was a noticeable reversal of the downward trend midway through the
10-year period (in 2015–16 and 2016–17). A possible
explanation for
this reversal, at least in part, is that it was an unintended consequence of the
introduction of Children’s
Court youth diversion in
Although youth diversion
was intended to create an alternative to sentencing for justice-involved
children, it is possible that the
initial use of youth diversion included
children who agreed to diversion but might have otherwise had the benefit of the
doli incapax
presumption or the withdrawal of charges on another basis.
Consultation for a previous project on crossover children revealed that
sometimes children can agree to a diversion because they want ‘to end the
court process quickly and by whatever means necessary’,
rather than the
court process being prolonged to have the issue of
doli incapax
determined, particularly when children don’t have family support in court
to encourage them to properly consider the ramifications
Recent research found
that, for children aged 10 to 13, the
doli incapax
processes take longer
(406 days on average from alleged offence to court outcome) than
Children’s Court youth diversion (249
days on average from alleged offence
to court outcome).
The data in Figure 4 supports the view that, at least in the beginning,
diversion was used in cases that might have been withdrawn
or not proven due to
doli incapax
. Figure 4 shows the number of sentenced or diverted cases
involving children aged 10 to 13 each year, isolating the cases with a
outcome. While the number of sentenced cases continued to steadily decrease, the
number of cases surged overall in 2015–16
and 2016–17. This surge
appears to be explained, primarily, by cases resulting in diversion.
Participants at our stakeholder
roundtable agreed that the overuse of diversion
in its early years was the most likely explanation for this initial surge in
but they also pointed out that the diversion system has since
‘matured’, with greater awareness about whether a case
doli incapax
We also heard that it
may be possible that, in some cases, Children’s Court youth diversion had
replaced other less formal
forms of diversion, like the ROPES program (police
diversion).

Total people aged 10 to 13
After 2016–17, the number of cases involving children aged 10 to 13
once again started decreasing. A possible contributor to
this shift could be the
High Court’s 2016 judgment in
which clarified the
approach to be taken in deciding whether a child is
doli incapax
Participants at our stakeholder roundtable suggested that this decision may have
caused an increase in the number of cases where
the child was found to be
doli incapax
(and also the number of cases where charges were withdrawn
on the basis of
), leading to a reduction in the

several practical changes that may have contributed to the decrease in the
number of sentenced younger children,
including the introduction of specialist

introduction of a diversion matrix (more recently replaced
by diversion
guidelines) for youth prosecutors; and, most recently, a move to ensuring that
all children in metropolitan Melbourne
have their cases heard in specialist
Children’s Court locations, and younger children must have their matters
heard in a specialist
list at the Melbourne Children’s Court (with limited
exceptions).
Offences by younger children are rarely sentenced in adult
The overwhelming majority of cases involving younger
children were sentenced or diverted in the Children’s Court (98%, or 2,894
of 2,949 cases) (Table 1). During the 10-year reference period, only a handful
of cases involving offences by younger children were
sentenced in the
Magistrates’ Court (23 cases, only 4 of which involved children aged 10 to
11) and in the County Court (32
none were sentenced in
the Supreme Court. Those cases finalised in the adult jurisdiction represent
just 0.003% of all cases sentenced
in the Magistrates’ Court
(approximately 1 per 37,935 cases) and 0.2% of cases sentenced in the County
Court (approximately
1 per 534 cases). Cases involving children aged 10 to 13
comprised 7.8% of cases sentenced or diverted in the Children’s Court.
This is around half the proportion (14.9%) found in similar research in
Queensland.
In each of the 55 cases sentenced in the adult jurisdiction, the
offender’s age at sentencing was 19 or older. This suggests
that the cases
were heard in the adult jurisdiction not because the seriousness of the
offending made it unsuitable for the matter
to be heard in the Children’s
Court, but instead because the Children’s Court no longer had jurisdiction
to finalise
the matter.
consistent with the policy intent that the Children’s Court ‘only
relinquish its jurisdiction with great
reluctance’,
with research showing that children aged 10 to 13 rarely commit serious

children aged 10 to 13 very rarely
commit homicide offences,
children aged 10 to 13 have been sentenced for a homicide offence in Victoria in
the past 25 years.

least one offence committed when the child was aged 14 or older: 87% (20 of 23
cases) in the Magistrates’ Court and
69% (22 of 32 cases) in the County
Court. It is possible that in some cases, a younger child’s matter was
heard in the adult
attention for more recent offending committed as an older child or as an adult,
and during the investigation, the police identified older offences committed
when the person was aged 10 to 13.
Characteristics of younger children who offend
This section examines
the characteristics of younger children who are sentenced or diverted in
Victoria, including their age at offence,
their gender, how many are Aboriginal
children, and how many are from regional Victoria. In this section, we discuss a
groups that are overrepresented in the justice system; our discussion
is based on data available to the Council and does not represent
an exhaustive
account of overrepresented groups.
Number of children, cases and charges
Table 3 shows the total number of unique children
sentenced or diverted in the 10 years to 30 June 2021 for at least one offence
when the child was aged 10, aged 11, aged 12 or aged 13. The table
includes the number of cases involving sentenced or diverted younger
and the total number of charges committed at each age (the table does not
include co-sentenced offences in the same case
for offences committed when the
person was aged 14 or older).

Table 3 shows that 1,891 unique people were sentenced or diverted during the
10-year period to 30 June 2021 for offending committed
aged 10 to 13. They were
sentenced or diverted in 2,949 cases (an average of 1.6 cases per person)
involving 16,913 charges committed
when aged 10 to 13 (an average of 8.9 charges
per person). They were sentenced or diverted for an additional 7,710 charges
when aged 14 or older (not shown in Table 3).
Most younger children are aged 13 when they offend
Of the 16,913 sentenced or diverted
committed by younger children, three-quarters were committed by a child aged 13
(12,680 of 16,913 charges), 20% were committed by
a child aged 12 (3,362
charges), and only 5% were committed by a child aged 10 to 11 (170 charges at
age 10 and 701 charges at age
11) (Table 3). These findings are consistent with
research elsewhere.
Breaking these figures down by jurisdiction, children aged 13 at their
offence date were responsible for:
75% of charges
in the Children’s Court involving children aged 10 to 13 at offence date
(12,605 of 16,784 charges);
57% of charges
in the Magistrates’ Court involving children aged 10 to 13 at offence date
(31 of 54 charges); and
59% of charges
in the County Court involving children aged 10 to 13 at offence date (44 of 75
On average, less than 25
a year in Victoria
involved offending by children aged 10 to 11 (22 cases a year). A further 70
cases per year, on average, involved
offences committed by children aged 12, and
230 cases involved offences committed by children aged 13.
These results are consistent with the Crime Statistics Agency’s recent
findings that, in the 12 months to 30 June 2022, 61%
of alleged younger
offenders were aged 13 at the time of offending, 27% were aged 12, 9% were aged
11 and just 3% were aged 10.
findings also suggest that there is a higher attrition rate for the youngest
children (aged 10 to 12) in the justice system.
The rate for children aged 10 to
12 dropped from 39% of
alleged young offenders
aged 10 to 13 (in Crime
Statistics Agency data) to 29% of
sentenced or diverted
cases involving
children aged 10 to 13 at offence (in court data). This drop is most likely due
to a combination of increased use
of pathways out of the justice system for the
youngest children and the need for the prosecution to rebut the presumption of
doli incapax
for children aged under 14, which may be especially
difficult in cases involving the youngest children.
Most younger children who offend are boys
Boys were substantially overrepresented among
children who were sentenced or diverted for offending committed when aged 10 to
comprising 74% of the 1,891 younger children in our study. The gender
disparity was especially apparent for younger children who
offended aged 10 to
11 – more than 90% were male. Boys were responsible for 74% of all
sentenced or diverted cases involving
younger children in the 10 years to 30
June 2021 (2,196 of the 2,949 cases in the Children’s Court,
Magistrates’ Court
and County Court).
Magistrates’ Court and County Court
In the adult jurisdiction, boys were responsible for
55 sentenced cases involving offending by a child aged 10 to 13 (all
23 cases in the Magistrates’ Court and 32 cases in the
County Court).
Children’s Court
In the Children’s Court (where almost all
cases involving younger children are sentenced), boys were responsible for 79%
charges involving younger children (13,265 of 16,784 charges). Boys were
particularly overrepresented in the youngest age categories.
responsible for:
97% of sentenced
or diverted offences committed by children aged 10 (160 of 165 charges);
93% of offences
aged 11 (647 of 693 charges);
81% of offences
aged 12 (2,699 of 3,321 charges); and
77% of offences
aged 13 (9,759 of 12,605 charges).
In comparison, boys were
responsible for 82% of offences involving children and young people aged 14 or
older in the Children’s
Court (152,137 of 186,063 charges).
These findings are consistent with prior research that has found that most
younger children who enter the justice system are male,
and the gender disparity
is most pronounced for the youngest
For instance, the
Baidawi et al. study of Victorian children aged 10 to 13 who allegedly offended
in 2017 found that 70.9% were male,
and the proportion of males was largely
consistent in police data and Children’s Court
Similarly, the Queensland
Sentencing Advisory Council recently found that 73.1% of children aged 10 to 13
at offence (and 83.7% of
those aged 10 to 11 at offence) were
These findings also
reflect the overrepresentation of males in the justice system more
Aboriginal children are substantially overrepresented
Aboriginal children were not identified in court
data for the reference period. However, a data linkage exercise conducted by the
Crime Statistics Agency (see Table 4) shows that Aboriginal children were
substantially overrepresented among children sentenced
or diverted for offences
committed when aged 10 to 13, comprising 22.5% of sentenced or diverted younger
children. This rate was:
more than double
the rate of Aboriginal children sentenced or diverted for offending committed
when aged 14 or older (10.3%); and
times the rate of Aboriginal children aged 10 to 13 in the Victorian population
(2.2% as at 30 June
younger children were at the time of their offence, the higher the proportion of
Aboriginal children in the group. Aboriginal
children comprised:
children who offended aged 10 to 11 (46 of 143 children);
children who offended aged 12 (122 of 444 children); and
children who offended aged 13 (301 of 1,427 children).
comparison, Aboriginal children comprised 2.2% of all children in Victoria in
each of the age categories (aged 10 to 11, aged 12
so the differences by age
are not explained by the underlying distribution of Aboriginal children within
the general population.

The overrepresentation
extends to children:
children aged 10 to 13 are more likely than their non-Aboriginal counterparts to
be arrested,
more likely to have
their case progress to court,
and more likely to be in detention or subject to youth
supervision.
Our findings
further highlight the extent to which that overrepresentation is magnified for
the youngest children sentenced or diverted
in the justice system in Victoria.
Children in regional Victoria are overrepresented
Children’s Court
Recent research, including
by this Council, has found an overrepresentation of younger children sentenced
in regional Victoria.
example, we previously found that 15% of sentenced children in regional courts
were aged 10 to 13 at sentencing, compared with
just 5% in metropolitan
Younger children in regional Victoria were twice as prevalent in the
justice system, involved in:
11% of cases in the Children’s Court in regional Victoria (1,710 of
15,438 cases)
5.5% of cases in the Children’s Court in metropolitan Melbourne
(1,184 of 21,655 cases)
Our findings in this report are consistent with past findings illustrating an
overrepresentation of younger children in regional areas,
with younger children
involved in 11% of Children’s Court cases in regional Victoria compared
with 5.5% of cases in metropolitan
As shown in Figure 6 we also found that regional overrepresentation is
especially magnified for the youngest children:
children aged 10
to 11 at their earliest offence were involved in 1.0% of Children’s Court
cases in regional Victoria compared
with 0.3% in metropolitan Melbourne. The
highest rates of children aged 10 to 11 were in Gippsland and Loddon Mallee
(1.3% each),
where the proportion of children aged 10 to 11 was more than double
the state average and more than quadruple the rate in metropolitan
children aged 12
at their earliest offence were involved in 2.8% of Children’s Court cases
in regional areas compared with 0.9%
in metropolitan Melbourne (especially in
Gippsland, Loddon Mallee and Barwon South West); and
children aged 13
at their earliest offence were involved in 7.4% of Children’s Court cases
in regional areas compared with 4.2%
in metropolitan Melbourne (especially in
Gippsland, Hume and Loddon Mallee).

Looking at the relationship in reverse, of the 2,894 cases involving children
who were sentenced or diverted in the Children’s
Court for offences
committed aged 10 to 13, more than half were in regional Victoria (59%, or 1,710
cases) while the remaining 41%
were in metropolitan Melbourne (1,184 cases).
Focusing on each younger age group, children from regional Victoria
69% of cases

68% of cases

55% of cases
involving children aged 13 at their earliest offence.
In comparison,
40% of cases involving children aged 14 or older at their earliest offence were
in regional Victoria.
To put these proportions in context, of all Victorian children aged 10 to 19,
children aged 10 to 14 comprise 50% of children in metropolitan
(303,555 of 603,613 children aged 10 to 19) and 51% of children in regional
Victoria (105,733 of 207,721 children aged
Therefore, the higher
proportions of younger children sentenced or diverted in regional Victoria do
not appear to be related to the
general distribution of children in those
It also seems that the overall decrease in Children’s Court cases
involving children aged 10 to 13 at the time of offending
(Figure 4) is a result
of decreases in
regional and metropolitan courts (Figure 7). The
proportion of Children’s Court cases involving children aged 10 to 13 at
halved from 6.2% to 3.1% in metropolitan Melbourne, and more than halved
from 13.4% to 5.8% in regional Victoria.

The same was true for County Court cases. Of the 32 cases involving children
aged 10 to 13 at the time of offending, almost half (47%,
or 15 cases) were
finalised in regional Victoria. In comparison, 17% of
County Court
cases were finalised in regional Victoria.
Time from offence to sentence
This section examines
the length of time between the earliest offence committed by younger children
and the sentence imposed in the
Children’s Court, Magistrates’ Court
and County Court for their offending.
Younger children wait longer to be sentenced after
Figure 8 shows that, in the Children’s Court,
10-year-old children experienced the longest period between their earliest
and sentencing (43 cases):
sentenced 11.1 months or more after their earliest offence (the median);
one-quarter were
sentenced three years or more after their earliest offence date (the 75th
percentile); and.
the longest time
between earliest offence and sentencing for a child aged 10 was 9 years and 10
months (though this case is an outlier).
Further, the median
decreased as age increased. The median period between earliest offence and
sentencing fell from 11.1 months for
children aged 10 at offence to 7.9 months
for children aged 13 at offence (Figure 8). In comparison, the median period
between earliest
offence and sentencing was 7.1 months for children aged 14 at
offence and 7.7 months for children aged 17 at offence.

How to read the box plots in Figure 8
The box plots use ‘box and whiskers’ to show key points in the
amount of time between younger children’s earliest
offence in their case
and the date of their sentence. These key points are:
(the horizontal line midway across the box), which shows the period between
offence and sentencing that half of the cases fall below
and half of the cases
are at or above;
(the top line of the box), which shows the period between offence
and sentencing that 75% of cases fall at or below;
(the bottom line of the box), which shows the period between
offence and sentencing that 25% of cases fall at or below;
(the lines extending above and below the box),
which show the minimum and maximum period between offence and sentencing;
statistical
(the dots above and below the box plot), which show the periods
between offence and sentencing that were so far beyond the normal
distribution
of the data that they fall outside the range of the box and whiskers. The
difference between younger and older children
was particularly stark at the 75th
percentile, which was 3 years for children who offended aged 10, compared with 1
year for children
To enable comparison with other research,
we looked at younger children as a combined group. Figure 9 provides a more
detailed distribution
of the time from younger children’s earliest offence
to sentencing. Most children who offended aged 10 to 13 were sentenced
diverted six months or more after the earliest offence in their case (64%), with
9% sentenced or diverted two years or more after
their earliest offence. The
median time from their earliest offence to sentencing or diversion was 8 months.
As children aged 13
are the largest group in our sample, however, Figure 9
largely reflects their experience.

These findings are consistent with Baidawi et al., which looked at 240
younger children who received court diversion, probation or
youth supervision
orders. Baidawi et al. found that the average period between an alleged offence
and the end of court proceedings
was approximately 8 months (249 days for
diversion, and 255 days for probation and youth supervision
In contrast, for
children whose matters resolved with a finding of
doli incapax,
period between alleged offending and the matter being finalised was over a year
(406 days),
reflecting in part
the additional time required for
doli incapax
Our analysis further revealed that the median time from earliest offence to
sentence was relatively stable over the period, with the
exception of a longer
median time in the final year during COVID-19 (Figure 10).

Median (months)
In the County Court, most younger children were sentenced 20
years or more after their earliest offence
In the 32 County Court cases involving offences by
younger children, the offending was not reported to police until the offender
older – in some cases it was not reported for years or even decades.
As a result, the cases appear to have been sentenced in
the County Court only
because the offender was too old for the Children’s Court jurisdiction by
the time the case commenced.
This was reflected in the time it took for these
cases to be sentenced – most younger children were sentenced 20 years or
after their earliest offence, and only 3 were sentenced within 10 years of
their earliest offence (Figure 11).

Offence types of younger children
This section examines
the nature of offending by younger children who were sentenced or diverted in
the Children’s Court, County
Court or Magistrates’ Court in the 10
years to 30 June 2021.
It begins with an analysis of all Children’s Court cases that involved
offending by younger children, including:
identifying the
principal (most serious) offence in the case (see below);
determining
whether younger children’s most serious offences were different to older
children’s most serious offences;
examining all
offences in their cases (including offences that were
serious offence);
determining
whether offending varied by age and gender; and
establishing
whether offending changed over time.
This section then examines
offences in the small number of Magistrates’ Court and County Court cases
that involved offending
by younger children.
Steps to determine the principal (most serious) offence in a

Younger children’s offences in the Children’s Court
Younger children’s most common principal offences
Table 5 shows the
principal offence types in all cases involving children sentenced or diverted in
the Children’s Court during
the 10-year reference period. In the table,
children are grouped by their age at the time of their principal offence: aged
11 (172 cases), aged 12 (520 cases), aged 13 (1,784 cases) and aged 14 or
older (over 34,000
Because there are processes in place to reduce the number of younger children
in the court system (for example, police cautions),
it was expected that only
younger children with more serious offences or prolific offending would be
sentenced or diverted. Consistent
with that expectation, the most common
principal offence type for children aged 10 to 11 was assault/cause injury
offences (66 cases,
comprising 38% of the 172 cases involving children aged 10
to 11). Even then, the majority of those cases involved less serious assault
offences under the
Summary Offences Act 1966
(Vic) (50 of the 66
assault/cause injury cases). The next 3 most common principal offence categories
for children aged 10 to 11 were
theft (32 cases), burglary (32 cases) and
property damage (19 cases). Those four offence categories accounted for almost
90% of principal
offences in the small number of cases involving children aged
10 to 11 at the time of their most serious offence.
Children who offended aged 12 had similar principal offence profiles to
children who offended aged 10 to 11. The most common principal
offence for
children aged 12 was assault/cause injury (38%, or 198 cases) and the second
most common principal offence was theft
(18%, or 96 cases). Again, most of these
assault/cause injury offences were under the
Summary Offences Act
(Vic) rather than under the
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic) (120 cases,
or 61% of 198 cases). Overall, the principal offence profiles of children aged
12 were similar to the offence profiles
for children aged 10 to 11 (for example,
38% of both groups had an assault/cause injury principal offence), although
there were also
differences (for example, the proportion with burglary offences
(13%) was more similar to children aged 13 (14%) than to children
aged 10 to 11

Children who offended aged 13 had the same 4 most common principal offence
categories as children aged 10 to 11 and aged 12 (assault/cause
injury, theft,
burglary and property damage). Offences under the
Summary Offences Act
again made up most of the assault/cause injury offences (349 cases, or 59%
of the 591 cases of this offence type). Children aged 13
also had slightly more
diverse offending, such as robbery (7% of cases) and traffic/vehicle offences
As a point of comparison, offending by children aged 14 or older was more
diverse: 8% of cases involved traffic/vehicle offences and
2% (803 cases)
involved drug offences (in contrast, just 6 cases (0.2%), in the entire cohort
of children aged 10 to 13 involved
drug offences).
There are stark differences between the volume of cases for younger children
and older children. Children aged 10 to 11, aged 12 and
aged 13 were responsible
for only a small proportion of Children’s Court cases involving
assault/cause injury offences (0.6%,
1.9% and 5.7%, respectively), while
children aged 14 or older were responsible for 92% of Children’s Court
cases involving
assault/cause injury (9,428 of 10,283 cases) (Figure 12).
There was relatively little change in younger children’s principal
offence types over the 10-year reference period. Assault/cause
injury was the
most common principal offence each year (between 31% and 40% of cases involving
offending by children aged 10 to 13),
followed by theft (between 13% and 26%
each year).

The above findings are broadly consistent with other research in
which shows that

offences) are the two most common offence
categories among children aged 10 to

raised concerns about the link between out-of-home care and

police are involved to manage problematic behaviour by children in care,
resulting in children being charged with offences
such as assault, burglary and
criminal damage, whereas police most likely would not have been involved had the
behaviour occurred
in the child’s family
The Victorian
Aboriginal Legal Service also observed that offences that initially look quite
serious, such as burglary, could sometimes
reflect behaviour such as a child
entering the staff office at their residential care home without
permission.
Age and gender
Table 6 shows the most serious offence types in
cases involving children aged 10 to 11, aged 12, aged 13 and aged 14 or older,
the data for boys and girls. The table shows that an overwhelmingly
small proportion of Children’s Court cases involved children
13, compared with children aged 14 or older. The table also shows that a higher
of girls (but a higher
of boys) had a principal
offence of assault/cause injury, although the relatively small number of cases
involving girls requires
caution with interpretation. Assault/cause injury was
the principal offence in:
42% of cases
involving girls aged 10 to 11 (5 of 12 cases) compared with 38% of cases
involving boys aged 10 to 11 (61 of 160 cases);
45% of cases
involving girls aged 12 (61 of 136 cases) compared with 36% of cases involving
boys aged 12 (137 of 384 cases);
43% of cases
involving girls aged 13 (218 of 508 cases) compared with 29% of cases involving
boys aged 13 (373 of 1,276 cases); and
34% of cases
involving girls aged 14 or older (2,633 of 7,832 cases) compared with 25% of
cases involving boys aged 14 or older (6,795
of 26,774 cases) (Table

the child’s age and/or gender was unknown.
Looking at all offences (not just the most serious in the
case), theft and property damage were more common than assault/cause injury
As mentioned, there is a risk in focusing only on
the most serious offence in cases involving children, because it can create a
misperception
that most offending by children is violent. The following analysis
shows that this is unfounded.
Table 7 examines all
(rather than cases) for which younger
children were sentenced or diverted in the 10 years to 30 June 2021. It shows
the number of
charges that children aged 10 to 11, aged 12, aged 13 and aged 14
or older were sentenced or diverted for in a particular offence
their case. It shows that younger children’s most common offence type was
theft, which accounted for 23% of
the charges for children aged 10 to 11 (201 of
858 charges), 29% of the charges for children aged 12 (951 of 3,321 charges),
31% of the charges for children aged 13 (3,870 of 12,605 charges). Looking
at younger children as a group, theft accounted for 30%
of their charges in the
10-year period (5,022 of 16,784 charges). The next three most common offence
assault/cause injury and justice offences.

Assault/cause injury offences
Of the 2,200 assault/cause injury charges committed
by younger children, most were less serious offences under the
Offences Act 1966
(Vic) rather than more serious offences under the
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic). The most common offences (1,707 of the 2,200
charges) were:
unlawful assault
(1,209 charges:
Summary Offences Act 1966
causing injury (352 charges:
Crimes Act 1958
assault with a
weapon or instrument (146 charges:
Summary Offences Act 1966
Of children sentenced for assault/cause injury offences,
there appeared to be an association between age at offence and the seriousness
of the assault/cause injury charge. The youngest children (aged 10 to 11) were
far more commonly sentenced for assault/cause injury
offences under the
Summary Offences Act 1966
(Vic), accounting for 89% of their
assault/cause injury charges, with 11% of offences under the
(Vic). Conversely, 75% and 74% of assault/cause injury offences
committed by children aged 12 and aged 13, respectively, were offences
Summary Offences Act 1966
(Vic). The proportion of assault/cause
offences under the
Summary Offences Act 1966
decreased to 67% for children aged 14 or older.
Overall, younger children committed less serious assault/cause injury
offences than older children
Burglary offences
Of the 1,245 burglary charges that involved younger
children, most charges involved burglary, rather than aggravated
The most common
specific offences for younger children were:
burglary (1,075
charges under
Crimes Act 1958
and attempted burglary (51
charges under
Crimes Act 1958
) – together
accounting for 90.4% of burglary offences;
burglary (112 charges under
Crimes Act 1958
charges were committed by children aged 13; and
other burglary
offences, including home invasion (4 charges under
Crimes Act 1958
and attempted aggravated burglary (3 charges under
Crimes Act 1958
Robbery offences
Relatively few armed robbery offences were among
younger children’s robbery charges (14%, or 74 of 533 robbery charges).
most common robbery offences for each age group of younger children were:
: robbery (4 of 10 robbery charges under
Crimes Act 1958
and attempted robbery (4 charges under
Crimes Act 1958
). There were no charges of armed robbery, carjacking or aggravated
carjacking for children aged 10 to 11.
robbery (36 of 64 robbery charges under
Crimes Act 1958
attempted robbery (12 charges under
Crimes Act 1958
). There were 9 charges of armed robbery but no charges of carjacking or
aggravated carjacking for children aged 12.
robbery (267 of 459 robbery charges under
Crimes Act 1958
armed robbery charges (65 charges under
Crimes Act 1958
There was one charge each of carjacking, aggravated carjacking and attempted
aggravated carjacking for children aged 13.
Sex offences
In the 10 years to 30 June 2021, the
Children’s Court sentenced 58 cases (involving 146 charges of sex
offences) that included
at least one sex offence committed by a younger child.
Those 58 cases involved:
18 charges of
sex offences committed by children aged 10 to 11 (across 8 cases);
36 charges of
sex offences committed by children aged 12 (across 20 cases); and
charges of sex offences committed by children aged 13 (across 37 cases) (Table
The principal offence in those cases
Of the 58 cases involving sex offences by younger
in 48 cases, the
principal offence was a sex offence committed by a younger child (the child was
aged 10 to 11 in 6 cases, the child
was aged 12 in 13 cases, and the child was
aged 13 in 29 cases);
in another 8
cases, the principal offence was a sex offence committed when the child was
aged 14 or older
but at least one co-sentenced sex offence was committed
when the child was younger (aged 12 in 2 cases and aged 13 in 6 cases –
none of these cases involved children aged 10 to 11);
in 1 case, the
principal offence was a sex offence but the age of the child was unknown, but
there were co-sentenced sex offences
that the child committed aged 10 to 11);
in 1 case, the
principal offence was not a sex offence (the principal offence was recklessly
causing injury), but the child had at
least one sex offence in the case
(committed when the child was aged 13).
Gender of children in cases where the principal offence was a
sex offence
Of the 48 cases involving younger children where
the principal offence was a sex offence, 46 cases involved boys and 2 cases
girls. In the 2 cases involving girls, in 1 case the principal offence
was indecent assault (the child was aged 12) and in the other
case the principal
offence was publishing child pornography (the child was aged 13). In the 46
cases involving boys, the principal
offences were:
(6 cases): indecent act with a child aged under 16 (2 cases) and
rape, indecent assault, sexual assault, and sexual penetration with
a child aged
under 16 (1 case each);
(12 cases): indecent act with a child aged under 16 (4 cases), sexual
assault (3 cases), incest with a sibling (2 cases), and indecent
assault, sexual
penetration with a child aged under 16, and attempt to procure a minor for child
pornography (1 case each); and
(28 cases): indecent act with a child aged under 16 (10 cases),
indecent assault (5 cases), sexual penetration with a child aged
under 16 (3
cases), incest with a sibling (3 cases), sexual assault (2 cases), and rape,
assault with intent to rape, wilful and
obscene exposure in public, visually
capture a person’s genitals (upskirting), and intentionally distribute an
intimate image
of another person (1 case each).
Of the 2 children
aged 10 to 13 (both boys) who committed a rape offence, one child was sentenced
to probation without conviction
for 4 charges of rape. Two charges were
committed when the child was aged 11, one charge was committed when the child
was aged 12
and one was committed when the child was aged 13, with no other
offences in the case. The other child was sentenced to a youth supervision
with conviction for 3 charges of rape, 3 charges of theft, 2 charges of arson,
and 2 charges of dealing with suspected proceeds
of crime (all committed when
the child was aged 13).
What if the new
Youth Justice Act
In the 10 years to 30 June 2021, 146
Children’s Court cases
had offences involving children aged
10 to 11 (5% of the 2,894 cases involving younger children, and 0.4% of all
37,093 Children’s
Court cases). This number of children aged 10 to 11
suggests that, with the age of criminal responsibility raised to 12 years old,
around 14 children per year, many of whom are likely to have experienced severe
trauma and disadvantage,
no longer have a sentencing response in the Children’s Court and will need
to have their behaviour addressed through the
alternative services
A further 1,940 cases solely had offences involving children aged 12 and aged
13 (67% of the 2,894 cases involving younger children,
and 5.2% of all 37,093
Children’s Court cases). While children aged 12 and aged 13 can still be
sentenced or diverted in the
Children’s Court, the new provisions in the
Youth Justice Act
will apply. Given that the new provisions include a
specified hierarchy of responses that police must consider before charging a
child aged 12 to 13, it may be that the number of sentenced or diverted children
aged 12 to 13 will reduce over time.
The remaining 756 cases involving younger children had a combination of
offences committed aged 10 to 13 and aged 14 or older (26.1%
of cases involving
younger children, and 2.0% of all Children’s Court cases). Once the new
Youth Justice Act
comes into effect, people are still likely to face
sentencing for offences committed aged 14 or older but offences committed aged
10 to 11 will not, and offences committed aged 12 to 13 might not, form part of
their sentenced case.
Younger children’s offences in the County Court
There were 32 County Court cases involving offences
committed by younger children during the reference period. In all of those
the principal offence was a sex offence. And most cases also included
offending beyond age 13:
10 of the 32
involved offences committed when the child was aged 10 to
22 cases also
included charges committed when the person was aged 14 or older:
cases, the principal offence was committed when the child was aged 10 to
cases, the principal offence was committed when the person was aged 14 to 18;
remaining 7 cases, the principal offence was committed when the person was aged
19 or older.
All 32 County Court cases involved sex
offences, and most cases also included offending beyond age 13
Looking at the specific offences in the 32 County Court cases:
the 19 cases where the
principal offence
was committed when the child was
aged 10 to 13
(either with or without offences committed aged 14 or
older), the specific offences were sexual penetration with a child aged under
indecent act with
a child aged under 16 (6
incest with a sibling
indecent assault
of a female (2 cases)
indecent assault of a male (1
Of this group, 12
children were aged 13 when they committed their principal
5 were aged
and the remaining 2 were

group were aged 10); and
the 13 cases where the
principal offence
was committed when the child was
aged 14 or older
, the specific offences were incest with a sibling (2
incest by a parent (1
sexual penetration
with a child aged under 16 (2
sexual penetration
with a child aged under 10 (1
indecent act with a
child aged under 16 (3
maintaining a sexual
relationship with a child aged under 16 (1
and indecent assault
Although the
offenders were aged 14 or older at their principal offence, each of these 13
cases also had a co-sentenced offence committed
when the child was younger. The
offender had a co-sentenced offence at age 13 in 8 of the 13
at age 12 in 6
at age 11 in 2
and at age 10 in one
case (the co-sentenced offence in that case was indecent assault of a male).
No sentenced charges of rape in the County Court were committed by children
aged 10 to 13 at the time of the offence; all rape offences
were committed by
people aged 14 or older.
What if the new
Youth Justice Act
In the 10 years to 30 June 2021, only two people
were sentenced (as adults) in the County Court
for offences
committed aged 10 to 11. One of these two people was aged 22 at sentencing and
the other was aged 41 (see
Case Study 1
). Such cases will no longer have
a sentencing response with the age of criminal responsibility raised to 12 years
old. The other
30 cases involved one or more offences committed by children aged
12 or older, and would still be subject to a potential sentencing
albeit within the new framework established by the
Youth Justice Act
Case Study 2
). The latter case raises questions about how the new
provisions of the
Youth Justice Act
should apply to offences committed
years or decades earlier, including the difficulties in establishing (as
required by
section 11)
that the person knew at the time – years or
decades ago – that what they were doing was seriously wrong.
Case Study 1
The offender pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual
penetration with a child aged under 10, representing four separate occasions on
which the victim performed oral sex on the offender. The offending occurred when
the victim visited a rural property where the offender
lived. The prosecution
was unable to specify the exact ages of the offender and victim at the time of
the offending. The court sentenced
the offender on the basis that he was about
age 11 at the time of the offending, and that the victim was aged under 10.
years after the offending, the victim, having spoken to police, phoned
the offender and asked why he did ‘those things’
to her. He replied
that ‘it was just, you know, we were sort of kids back then’. He
said that he did not have a reason
and was terribly sorry for doing it. The
offender was then interviewed by police, and he admitted to the conduct.
The offender was aged 41 at sentencing, had no further convictions, had a
partner and child, and was employed in a management position.
It did not appear
that any similar conduct had occurred since and there appeared to be no risk of
reoffending. The court noted the
difficulty in sentencing the offender as an
adult given that if he had been sentenced at age 11, he would have been
sentenced in
the Children’s Court where general deterrence would not have
been a sentencing purpose, and the outcome would likely have prioritised
rehabilitation rather than punishment. The court also noted, however, that the
consequences to the victim were ‘dramatic
and [had] been
longstanding’ including post-traumatic stress disorder, feelings of guilt
and blame, difficulties with intimate
relationships and fears for her own
The court sentenced the offender to a 12-month adjourned undertaking without

Case Study 2
The offender pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual
penetration with a child aged under 16. There was some uncertainty about the
but he was sentenced on the basis that he was aged 13 at the time and
the victim was aged 7. The offender had not offended before
or in the 15 years
since. The sentencing judge found that the offending had severe and long-term
consequences for the victim and
the victim’s family.
In the 15 years between the offence and sentence, the offender had qualified
as a teacher. After being charged, the offender informed
his employer, and he
was suspended by the Teachers Registration Board. His suspension was posted on
the Registration Board website
and was able to be ‘viewed by the world at
large’. Because he pleaded guilty to a sex offence involving a child (even
though he was a child himself at the time of the offence), his teacher’s
registration was automatically cancelled, and his
‘chosen vocation of a
teacher ... [was] now lost forever’. The principal of the school where the
offender taught provided
a reference to the court, stating that ‘she was
shocked when [the offender] told her about being charged... [and] considered
that the alleged offending was totally out of character with the person that she
had known in a professional context for several
Considering myriad factors, including the offender’s age at the time of
the offence, his subsequent good character, his remorse
and the loss of his
teaching career, the sentencing judge did not record a conviction, placing him
on an adjourned undertaking. The
judge said:
‘In my view the discretion to not order a conviction should be exercised
in your favour. In coming to that conclusion, it is
necessary to emphasise again
that sexual offending against children is most serious indeed. However, I take
into account your age,
your character and past history and I accept the
contention of your counsel ... as to the impact of the recording of a
conviction.’
Sentencing remarks provided to the Council
Younger children’s offences in the Magistrates’
In the 10 years to 30 June 2021, 23
Magistrates’ Court cases included offences committed by younger children.
Ten of those 23
cases included at least one sex offence committed by the child
when they were aged 10 to 13.
In the Magistrates’ Court, younger children were sentenced for a
variety of offending, and most cases also included co-sentenced
committed aged 14 or older
Three cases included only offences committed at age 10 to 13. The other 20
cases included a range of offences committed both before
and after the person
turned 14. In 10 of those cases, the principal offence was committed when the
child was aged 10 to 13; in the
other 10 cases, the principal offence was
committed when the child was aged 14 or older, with co-sentenced offences
committed aged
10 to 13. Focusing on the principal offences:
in the 3 cases
where all offences in the case were committed at age 10 to 13, the principal
offences were indecent assault of a female,
burglary, and theft of a motor
vehicle (in each case the child was aged 12 at the time of the principal
in the 10 cases
where the principal offence was committed by children aged 10 to 13 but
co-sentenced offences were committed when
the children were aged 14 or older,
the principal offence mainly involved sex offences – indecent act with a
child aged under
16 (6 cases) and incest with a sibling (1 case). The principal
offences in the remaining cases were burglary (2 cases) and criminal
case). Most of these offenders were aged 13 at the time of their principal
offence (8 cases), and the rest were aged 12
(2 cases); and
in the remaining
10 cases, the principal offence was committed by children aged 14 or older (with
co-sentenced offences committed
when the children were aged 10 to 13). The
principal offences in those cases were burglary (5 cases), aggravated burglary
drive at a dangerous speed (1 case), possess cocaine (1 case),
indecent act with a child aged under 16 (1 case), and indecent assault
female (1 case). The most common co-sentenced offences committed by children
aged 10 to 13 were theft (11 charges), indecent
act with a child aged under 16
(6 charges), burglary (6 charges), and indecent assault of a female (3 charges).
What if the new
Youth Justice Act
All children involved in the 23 Magistrates’
Court cases would still potentially face sentencing under the new
Justice Act
no children
committed offences aged 10 to 11 only (below the new age of criminal
responsibility);
13 children
would still potentially face prosecution for principal offences committed aged
12 or aged 13, subject to the new provisions

Sentencing offences by younger children
This section looks at
the sentencing orders imposed in the Children’s Court, County Court and
Magistrates’ Court in the
2,949 cases involving offences committed by
younger children.
In this section, children’s age is their age at the time of principal
offence, whereas children may have been somewhat or significantly
older at the
time of sentencing. For the purposes of this report, Children’s Court
youth diversion is discussed as a type of
sentencing order, although youth
diversion is not a
‘sentence’.
supervision orders, youth attendance orders and youth control orders have been
grouped together as
supervised community orders
because they were rarely
imposed on younger children. Although also a supervised order, probation is kept
separate in the analysis
as it was more common in sentencing cases involving
offending by younger children.
Sentence severity increased as age at offence increased
Figure 13 shows the sentencing outcomes for cases
sentenced or diverted in the Children’s Court where the principal offence
was committed by a child aged 10 to 11, aged 12, aged 13, or aged 14 or older.

Sentence types increased in severity with age at time of principal offence.
Children aged 10 to 11 at the time of principal offence
tended to receive the
least severe sentencing outcomes, including diversion (31.4% of cases involving
children aged 10 to 11), dismissal
(6.4%) and undertakings (20.9%). The most
severe sentence imposed on a child aged 10 to 11 at principal offence was
probation (16.3%,
or 28 of 172 cases); no other supervised community orders or
youth detention orders were imposed in cases involving children aged
10 to 11 at
principal offence in the 10-year period. In contrast, children aged 12, aged 13
or aged 14 or older at their principal
offence also received other supervised
community orders (youth supervision orders, youth attendance orders or youth
control orders).
Supervised community orders were imposed in 4.6% of the 520
cases involving children aged 12 at principal offence, 7.5% of the 1,784
involving children aged 13 at principal offence, and 10.7% of the 34,606 cases
involving children aged 14 or older at principal
offence. Probation was also an
important option for children aged 12 and aged 13 at principal offence, with
almost one in four children
aged 12 (24% of 520 cases) and aged 13 (22.9% of
1,784 cases) receiving probation.
Fines were also a very rare outcome for children who committed their most
serious offence at a younger age, imposed in 1.2% of cases
involving children
aged 10 to 11 at principal offence (2 of 172 cases), 0.4% of cases involving
children aged 12 (2 of 520 cases)
and 1.0% of cases involving children aged 13
(18 of 1,784 cases). Participants at our stakeholder roundtable expressed
surprise at
the use of fines for younger
commented, ‘I’m shocked by the use of fines especially for the
youngest children’, although the participant
acknowledged that the
children may have been older by the time they were
participant also noted that the use of fines has declined significantly as a
sentencing outcome for all children, including
Justice Act
now provides that courts may only impose a fine on a child aged
15 or older at sentencing
(section 249)
(currently fines can be imposed on
children aged under 15, but the maximum fine amount is less for younger
Fines would,
though, continue to be available for children who offend aged under 15 but who
are aged 15 or older at sentencing.
In the 10-year period, youth detention was imposed in 30 cases involving a
child aged 10 to 13 at principal offence. None of these
cases involved a child
aged 10 to 11 at principal offence, 3 cases involved a child aged 12 (0.6% of
the 520 cases involving children
aged 12 at principal offence) and 27 involved a
child aged 13 (1.5% of the 1,784 cases involving children aged 13 at principal

causing injury and theft of a motor vehicle (4 cases each);

cases each);
attempted armed robbery, and assault with a weapon or instrument (2 cases each);
criminal damage,

deception, assault police, common assault,
and possess a controlled weapon (1

The 30 cases receiving youth detention comprised 1.6% of
the 1,892 Children’s Court cases where youth detention was imposed
our 10-year reference period (Figure 14).

Use of Children’s Court youth diversion has increased
dramatically for younger children
Following a successful pilot in 2015, court-ordered
diversion became available statewide in the Children’s Court in
Since then,
Children’s Court youth diversion has made up an increasingly large
proportion of all outcomes in the Children’s
Court (54% in 2022–23,
or 1,215 of 2,242 cases).
can be seen in Figure 15, that increase has been even starker for younger
children. Overall, in the last five years of our study
(2016–17 to
2020–21), diversion was imposed in:
75% of cases
where the principal offence was committed by a child aged 10 to 11 (51 of 68
55% (97 of 176
cases) and 53% (362 of 685 cases) where the principal offence was committed by a
child aged 12 or aged 13, respectively;
33% of cases
where the principal offence was committed by a child aged 14 or older (5,136 of
15,499 cases).
Figure 15: Proportion of Children’s Court
cases resulting in youth diversion, by age at time of principal offence,
Principal offence aged 10 to 11 (88 cases)
Principal offence aged 12 (238 cases)
Principal offence aged 13 (916 cases)
Principal offence aged 14 or older (18,970 cases)
For younger children, the use of Children’s Court youth diversion
appears to have largely replaced the use of probation, good
behaviour bonds and
undertakings, which was relatively stable until 2015 but then dramatically
decreased after youth diversion was
introduced (Figure 16). In contrast, the use
of other sentencing orders, such as youth detention, youth control orders, youth
orders, youth supervision orders and dismissals, remained relatively
rare and stable. To highlight the distinct reductions in the
use of the three
sentencing orders for younger children:
good behaviour
bonds decreased from 42% in 2011–12 to 18% in 2020–21 of outcomes in
Children’s Court cases involving
offending by children aged 10 to 13;
decreased from 31% to 8%; and
undertakings
(predominantly
accountable
undertakings) decreased from 16% to 1%.

Figure 17 shows the rate of youth diversion in each justice region in
Children’s Court cases involving children sentenced or
diverted for
offences committed aged 10 to 13. The justice region with the lowest rate of
youth diversion was Gippsland, where 13.1%
of cases involving children aged 10
to 13 resulted in youth diversion. In contrast, the South Eastern metropolitan
region had the
highest rate, with just over 35% of cases involving children aged
10 to 13 resulting in youth diversion.

Sentencing outcomes in the County Court
In the 32 County Court cases involving offences by
younger children (only 5 of which included offences by children aged 10 to 11),
the sentences most commonly imposed were adjourned undertakings (10 cases, 7
without conviction), imprisonment (8 cases) and wholly
suspended sentences (8
cases) (see Figure 18 and Table 8). The remaining outcomes were community
correction orders (4 cases) and
partially suspended sentences (2 cases).
Suspended sentences were phased out in the higher courts but remain available
for some historical
As discussed above, the 32 County Court cases involved:
19 cases where
the principal offence was committed by a child aged 10 to 13 (either with or
without other offences committed when
older); and
13 cases where
the principal offence was committed by a child aged 14 or older (with at least
one co-sentenced offence committed aged
There was a
noticeable difference between the most severe sentences imposed in cases
involving children aged 10 to 13 at principal
offence and the most severe
sentences imposed in cases involving children aged 14 or older at principal
offence (with co-sentenced
offences aged 10 to 13). For example, all the prison
sentences were imposed in cases involving children aged 14 or older at principal
offence, whereas all of the adjourned undertakings were imposed in cases
involving children aged 10 to 13 at principal offence (Figure
18 and Table

There are several possible explanations why these County Court cases may have
received less severe sentencing outcomes where the principal
offence was
committed by a child aged 10 to 13.
‘Had you been dealt with soon after the offending ... it is most
likely ... you would have been sentenced in the Children’s
child for that offending. Had that occurred, it is likely you could have
expected a non-custodial disposition, having
regard to sentencing principles
applicable in that jurisdiction where rehabilitation of child offenders is a
guiding principle.’
Sentencing remarks provided to the Council
First, an offender’s age is a relevant consideration at
sentencing.
Had these younger
children been sentenced as children in the Children’s Court, they would
have been sentenced under the principles
in that jurisdiction, where
rehabilitation is a guiding principle, including the importance of reducing the
risk of stigmatising
Second, as discussed earlier, most of these cases took years or decades to
reach court. For offenders who did not reoffend after their
childhood offending,
there was arguably little need to give significant weight to the sentencing
purposes of community protection
or specific deterrence.
Third, given the significant passage of time in these cases, it would have
been extremely difficult for the prosecution to rebut the
presumption of
. As a result, the offenders’ guilty plea (in 17 of the 19
cases) arguably would have carried greater weight than usual, both
as evidence
of remorse and in terms of utilitarian value.
Finally, there may be some recognition that had these offenders been
sentenced as children, at least some of them would have been
eligible for a
therapeutic treatment order, an option no longer available once a child reaches
Therapeutic
treatment orders have been available in the Family Division of the
Children’s Court since 2007 as an alternative

offenders ... In assessing the nature and gravity of your offending and your
moral culpability,
I must take account of the fact that in relation to the
charges you were a young person of immature years. If the charges had been

part in the sentencing process. The court would
have made orders that focused on
your rehabilitation. Had these matters proceeded in the Children’s Court,
it is most likely
that you would have been placed on a therapeutic treatment
order in the family division or been released on a supervisory order in

Sentencing remarks provided to the Council
Sentencing outcomes in the Magistrates’ Court
In the 23 Magistrates’ Court cases involving
offending by younger children, the most severe sentence in the case was
imprisonment
(5 cases), a community correction order (6 cases) and an adjourned
undertaking (6 cases). The most severe sentences imposed in the
remaining cases
were a fine (3 cases), a partially suspended sentence (2 cases) and diversion (1
case). Only 4 Magistrates’
Court cases involved a child aged 10 to 11 at
the time of the offending.
As with prison sentences in the County Court cases, prison sentences in
Magistrates’ Court cases mostly involved children who
committed their
principal offence aged 14 or older (and also had co-sentenced offences committed
aged 10 to 13 in their case) (see
Figure 20 and Table 9). The one exception was
a prison sentence imposed in a case involving 2 charges of sex offences
committed by
a child aged 13, which were sentenced alongside 3 charges committed
when the offender was aged 31 (2 charges of failing to comply
with reporting
obligations as a registered sex offender (
Sex Offenders Registration Act 2004
charge of failing to answer bail).

Findings, implications and conclusion
In this report, we
examined sentenced or diverted cases involving younger children (those aged 10
to 13 at the time of offending).
To contextualise our findings, it’s important to note that only about
9% of alleged offences by children aged 10 to 13 are ever
finalised in court;
more commonly younger children are (appropriately) funnelled out of the justice
system through police cautions,
other diversionary initiatives, and the
application of
doli incapax
(the presumption that children aged 10 to 13
are incapable of crime unless the prosecution can prove beyond reasonable doubt
the child knew that their conduct was morally
With the pending implementation of the new
Youth Justice Act 2024
(Vic), it is important to understand the profiles of children who offend
aged 10 and aged 11 to inform the approach to their behaviour
now that the age
of criminal responsibility has risen to 12 years old, and a criminal justice
response will no longer be available.
Equally important is understanding the
profiles of children who offend aged 12 and aged 13, to consider how the
provisions of the
Youth Justice Act
might operate in responding to their
offending and to provide a baseline for future comparison.
This final section discusses some of the key findings in this report and the
potential implications of the new
Youth Justice Act

compared with 2,302 cases for children aged 13.
the profiles
of children aged 12 are noticeably different
to the profiles of children
aged 13. Differences between children aged 12 and children aged 13 were evident
in relation to gender,
the overrepresentation of Aboriginal children, offence
aged 12 and children aged 13 should be considered as two distinct age groups in
policy development;
younger children
were overrepresented in
rural and regional Victoria
Children’s Court cases sentenced or diverted in regional Victoria involved
one or more offences committed by
children aged 10 to 13, compared with 5.5% of
Children’s Court cases in metropolitan Melbourne. However, the proportion
younger children in both regional and metropolitan Melbourne Children’s
Court locations halved in the 10 years to 30 June 2021
(from 13.4% to 5.8% in
regional Victoria);
overrepresentation of
Aboriginal children
in the justice system is
acutely magnified for younger children – the younger children were at
their offence, the higher the
proportion of Aboriginal children in the group.
Aboriginal children accounted for 32.2% of children who were sentenced or
for offences committed aged 10 to 11, compared with 27.5% of children
who were sentenced or diverted for offences committed aged
12, 21.1% of children
aged 13, and 10.3% of children aged 14 or older. For context, 2.2% of all
Victorian children aged 10 to 13
(as at 30 June 2021) were Aboriginal

most common principal offence
younger children were assault/cause injury, theft, burglary and property damage.
But looking at all
for which younger children were sentenced or
diverted in the 10 years to 30 June 2021 (rather than just the most serious
in each case), younger children’s most common offence type was
theft, which accounted for 30% of their charges. In the 10 years
2021, 58 of the 2,894 cases in the Children’s Court involved at least one
sex offence
committed by a child aged 10 to 13;
in 55 cases,
younger children’s offending was not sentenced until they were
– 32 cases in the County Court and 23 cases in the
Magistrates’ Court. Almost all of these cases (42 cases) had at least
sex offence charge in the case;
younger children
tended to receive
less severe sentencing outcomes
than older children.
Children aged 10 to 11 at the time of their offending received the highest rates
of diversion, dismissals and
undertakings in the Children’s Court, whereas
children aged 12 and then aged 13 received increasingly severe sentencing
overall. This likely reflects the different offending profiles,
vulnerabilities and culpability levels of the youngest children;
younger children
very rarely sentenced to youth detention
. No child aged 10 to 11 at

become an increasingly common outcome of criminal proceedings involving
children, especially
for younger children (representing 63.2% of all outcomes
for younger children in 2020–21).
Children in regional Victoria
This report, like previous
found that children
from regional Victoria were overrepresented among younger children in the
justice system. This overrepresentation
is not explained by a greater number of
younger children in regional Victoria. The primary explanation for the
overrepresentation
is usually a lack of comprehensive support services for
at-risk children and families in regional
A participant at our
stakeholder roundtable noted that ‘under-serving regional areas usually
goes hand-in-hand with the overrepresentation
of vulnerable
Other contributors to this overrepresentation may include a lack of
specialist practitioners in regional courts (which, for example,
can affect the
consideration of
and a lack of
separation between court facilities for adults and court facilities for
children, resulting in fewer magistrates who
sit exclusively in the
Children’s Court in regional
This landscape is
rapidly changing, however. In 2016, the High Court clarified the approach to
doli incapax
and since then the test has been codified in the new
Youth Justice Act
(Vic). The new
Youth Justice
also introduces early
diversion group conferences, which aim ‘to divert eligible children out of
the criminal justice system
before charges are
and creates a
mandatory obligation for police to refer a child aged under 14 to an early
diversion group conference.
Sentencing does not provide a ‘swift’ response to
younger children’s behaviour
Younger children sentenced in the Children’s
Court had a median time of 8 months between the earliest offence in their case
and their sentence. The younger children were at their earliest offence, the
longer their median time from earliest offence to sentencing.
The time between offence and sentencing is likely to, at least partly,
reflect the operation of necessary safeguards, such as adjourning
a case for a
child to obtain legal representation, or to determine whether the child has
criminal capacity (or whether
doli incapax
applies). In some cases, the
delay may be a result of the child having offended prolifically, requiring the
case to be adjourned
so that cases can be consolidated. In other instances, the
time taken may reflect a child’s lack of a stable home and support
network, for example, missing court dates because the adult responsible for the
child’s care and wellbeing does not ensure
the child’s presence in
court. Other reasons for the passage of time between offending and sentencing
include the time taken
to identify and charge younger children and the
difficulties in obtaining instructions from children, particularly those not
with their family of origin and/or experiencing instability in their home
life and schooling. And in cases involving sex offences
against other children,
‘[t]he nature and dynamics of sexual offending against children mean that
the passage of considerable
time between offending and its disclosure is not
For example,

Whatever the reason, it is not ideal for a relatively young child to receive
a response to their problematic behaviour months, or
years, after the fact. It
is well documented that for a consequence to be an effective response to a

The passage of time between younger children’s offending and the

For example,
a three-year gap between offending and sentencing for a child who offends aged
10 means that a high-school-aged child
faces the consequences for actions taken
when they were a primary-school-aged child. In 2017, Armytage and Ogloff made
several recommendations
designed to address the delay between the offending and
sentencing of children and young people and increase opportunities for

to have involved serious violence or injury. No murder or manslaughter offences
were committed by a child aged
10 to 11 (or aged 12 or aged 13 for that matter).
There were 8 Children’s Court cases involving sex offences committed by
aged 10 to 11 (including 1 case with 2 rape charges). A further 5
people were sentenced as adults in the County Court for sex offences
aged 10 to 11, and one person was sentenced in the Magistrates’ Court for
one sex offence committed aged 11.
Children aged 12 or aged 13
Children aged 12 or aged 13 at their offence still

Youth Justice Act
subject to the test for criminal capacity. However, the additional protections
and measures in the
Youth Justice Act
make a reduction likely in the
number of children aged 12 or aged 13 who face sentencing under that Act.
In the 10 years to 30 June 2021, 1,940 Children’s Court cases involved
offences committed solely by children aged 12 or aged
There were also 50 cases involving children who offended aged 12 or aged 13

involved people sentenced in the County Court for offences committed aged 12 or
aged 13 (all sex offences), and
21 cases involved people sentenced in the
Magistrates’ Court for offences committed aged 12 or aged 13 (a mix of sex
and non-sex offences). Of these 50 cases, 12
offences committed when the child was aged 12 or aged 13 (8 cases in the County
Court and 4 cases in the Magistrates’
Youth Justice Act
sets out additional measures for children
who offend aged 12 or aged 13. Consideration will need to be given to how these
apply to offences committed by children aged 12 or aged 13 but not
reported or prosecuted until after the child reaches adulthood.
For example, the
matters that the police must consider in deciding whether to charge a child aged
12 or aged 13
appear to apply
even if the person is older (even an adult) by the time the offending behaviour
is reported or investigated. In contrast,
prosecutors are required to review a
charge against a child who allegedly committed an offence aged 12 or aged
but this requirement only
applies to summary procedures commenced in the Children’s Court and does
not apply if the charge
is prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions
(although all prosecutors have a general duty to only prosecute a person if

matters including ‘all the admissible evidence’

In the 10 years to 30 June 2021, 30 children received youth detention in the
Children’s Court for a principal offence committed
aged 12 (3 cases) or
aged 13 (27 cases). One person received a prison sentence (at age 32) in the
Magistrates’ Court for a
principal offence committed aged 13 – he
was the only person sentenced to an immediate prison term for a principal
committed aged 10 to 13. He was sentenced for 2 sex offences committed
when he was aged 13 and an additional 3 charges committed
when he was aged 31.
He was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment (with 173 days reckoned as time
served) and a 24-month community

The new provisions of the
Youth Justice Act

Children’s Court from imposing a sentence of detention on a child aged
under 14 at the time of the offence except
in certain circumstances relating to
the seriousness of the offences and the seriousness of the risk posed by the
child to the community
(section 324).
This provision does not seem to apply
where a person offends aged 12 or aged 13 but is not sentenced for the offences
until adulthood.

future sentencing of younger children in Victoria.
Younger children’s offending was sentenced in adult
courts because they ‘aged out’ of the Children’s Court
The vast majority of younger children’s cases
were finalised in the Children’s Court (98%, or 2,894 cases), with the
55 cases finalised in the Magistrates’ Court (23 cases) and
County Court (32 cases). There were no cases involving offending
by children
aged 10 to 13 in the Supreme Court. Based on the charge type and age of the
offender at sentencing, all these cases were
sentenced in the adult courts
because the Children’s Court no longer had jurisdiction to hear the matter
(that is, the offenders
had reached adulthood), not because the offending was
considered too severe to be dealt with in the Children’s Court.
Sentencing adults for offences committed when they were
younger children
The findings of this report raise questions about
the circumstances in which younger children’s offending is not prosecuted
before those children reach adulthood and are no longer eligible for their
proceedings to be heard in the Children’s Court.
Most of the 32 younger
children sentenced in the County Court were aged 30 or older by the time they
were sentenced: 10 were in their
30s, 7 in their 40s, 5 in their 50s, and one
person (the oldest) was aged 67. Participants at our stakeholder roundtable

not only to prove you did the acts, but that
you knew the conduct was wrong. What this reveals is that the law recognises the
of a child as impacting on all aspects of culpability, most
importantly in this case, your moral culpability.’
Sentencing remarks provided to the Council
In several of the County Court cases, the court commented on the difficulty
of sentencing an adult for offences committed aged 10
to 13 when years, or
sometimes decades, had passed since the offences. There is a difficult balancing
required between acknowledging
that the person being sentenced is no longer the
same person that committed the offences and recognising that the offence has had
long-term and significant effects on the victim.
As discussed above, the new
Youth Justice Act
contains a range of
protections for children who offend aged under 14. Section 4(1) of the Act
defines a ‘child’ as ‘a
person who is under 18 years of
age’, but the Act does not define or limit the stage in proceedings at
which the person must
be under 18. And sections 4(2) and (3) add that the
definition of
‘includes, in the case of a person who commits
an offence or is alleged to have committed an offence, a person who’ was
aged under 18 ‘at the time of the commission or alleged commission of the
offence’, and is aged under 19 ‘at the
time of the commencement of
the proceeding for the offence or alleged offence’.
Therefore, the provisions relevant to the stage before proceedings commence
appear to apply regardless of the person’s age when
the provisions are
being applied. On this basis, the following protections
apply to people who offend aged under
but are not prosecuted for
those offences until they are adults:
the provision
that raises the age of criminal responsibility to age 12 (section 10);
the codified
test for criminal capacity (section 11);
the requirement
that police have regard to particular matters (relating to criminal capacity) in
deciding whether to charge a child
aged 12 or aged 13 (section 12);

applies to prosecutions in the Children’s Court. However, prosecutors in
all courts have a general duty
to only prosecute a person if ‘there is a

the admissible evidence’ and ‘the reliability and
credibility of the evidence’, which would include an assessment

Youth Justice
provides that a ‘sentence imposed on a child should give the
highest priority to the rehabilitation and positive development
(section 203)
and that the ‘common law principle of general
deterrence does not apply to the sentencing of a child under this Act’
(section 202(3)).
If a child ages out of the Children’s Court jurisdiction
and is sentenced in the adult jurisdiction, the principles in the

employment.

ensure that no such behaviour occurred again.’
Sentencing remarks provided to the Council
Spent Convictions Act
The Victorian spent convictions scheme allows
convictions for certain offences to be withheld from a person’s police
(spent) in certain
circumstances.
The way that
the scheme works depends on the type of offence, the sentence imposed and the
person’s age at the time of the
offence. Spent convictions do not appear
on a person’s record, and the person is not required to disclose a spent
conviction.
There are, however, exemptions to non-disclosure of spent
convictions, and these exceptions allow spent convictions to be disclosed

and does not appear on their police record unless there is an

conditions are
In effect, this
means that during the operational period of the order, the child has a
disclosable criminal record.
A person’s age when their charges are determined may affect the
application of the spent convictions scheme, even if the person
is aged under 15
at the time of the offence. For example, the broader availability of pre-trial
diversionary measures in the Children’s
Court (such as the therapeutic
treatment program) may result in a child not having a criminal record at all. If
criminal proceedings
are not commenced until the child is an adult, those
diversionary options may no longer be available, which may result in the person
having a disclosable criminal record. Even if the person is sentenced to an
adjourned undertaking without a recorded conviction,
their conviction will not
be spent until the conditions of the adjourned undertaking are complete. Even
once spent, the conviction
remains disclosable for certain purposes under the
exemptions.
Therefore, although the provisions of the
Spent Convictions Act 2021
(Vic) refer to a child’s age at the time of the
whether a younger child ends up with a criminal record can be directly
influenced by their age when criminal proceedings commence.

of the data used in this report was extracted from the Courtlink Case Management
System (Children’s Court and Magistrates’
Court) and the Higher
Courts Conviction Returns database (County Court and Supreme Court). Offence
dates for the County Court and
Supreme Court were obtained through a combination
of additional data requests as well as a review of sentencing remarks, while
dates for the Children’s Court and Magistrates’ Court were
already present in Courtlink. Children’s age at offence
determined by calculating the difference between the relevant offence date or
dates and the child’s date of birth.

Court youth diversion is a ‘pre-plea option’ that gives children an
opportunity to accept responsibility
for the offence and complete a diversion
plan, and if they do so allows for their charges to be discharged without a
criminal record.

and an offence committed

noted above n 1, from 30 September 2025 (unless proclaimed earlier),
Youth Justice Act 2024
(Vic) will commence, raising the age of
criminal responsibility from 10 to 12:
Youth Justice Act 2024
(see chapter 19.1 of the Act for transitional provisions). Once section 10
commences (raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility
to 12), the
provisions in the Act specific to children aged under 14 will in effect apply to
children aged 12 and 13.
a child is alleged to have committed an offence, a police officer may decide
‘to take no action under [the
Youth Justice Act
] or any other Act
or law against the child for the alleged offence’ (section 92(1)(a)). The
police officer may only move to
the next option in the hierarchy (a youth
warning) if taking no action against the child is ‘clearly
inappropriate’.
Therefore, if a child is alleged to have committed an
offence, before a police officer can commence a criminal proceeding against
child, the police officer must have first determined that taking no action,
giving a youth warning or a youth caution, or referring
the child to an early
diversion youth conference are ‘clearly inappropriate’ (section
92(1)(e)). For each pre-trial option,
the Act sets out a list of matters that
affect a child’s eligibility (sections 96, 104 and 118(3)),
and for early diversion group conferences, the Act also sets out
matters that
affect a child’s eligibility (section 118(1)). A child’s
age at the time that the decision is being made is not included
matters that do or don’t affect eligibility.
Justice Act 2024
–(2). if a police officer is satisfied
that there is sufficient evidence to charge a child with an offence (and decides
taking no action, giving a youth warning or a youth caution are clearly
inappropriate) and ‘at the time of the alleged offending
... the child is
under 14 years of age’, the police officer ‘must decide to refer the
child to an early diversion group
conference in respect of the alleged
offence’. The requirement is also subject to
section 118
which sets out
eligibility requirements, including that there must be ‘a suitable
approved service provider to conduct the
early diversion group
conference’:
Youth Justice Act 2024
s 118(1)(a).
further above n 21. Therapeutic treatment orders provide for a child to be
discharged from criminal proceedings if they ‘attend
and participate in a
therapeutic treatment program’. The orders are available for children up
to the age of 14 before 29 March
2019 and up to the age of 17 thereafter:
