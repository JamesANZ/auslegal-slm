The Critical Criminology Companion
Edited by Thalia Anthony and Chris Cunneen
Reviewed by Christopher Beshara
The ‘critical’ in this book’s title is not a buzzword
unthinkingly added by the publisher as the manuscript went
to press. Rather, it
characterises a radical approach to the study of crime control and social policy
advocated by this compilation’s
manifold contributors. Whereas
administrative criminologists at the coalface of criminal policy formulation are
often insensitive
to just how politicised and value-laden their vocation is,
these self-styled ‘critical’ criminologists are anything but
disengaged.
The editors’ stated intention is twofold: to showcase the intellectual
ferment of critical and theoretically informed criminologists
among cutting-edge
academics in Australia and New Zealand, and to expose students and experts alike
to compelling policy alternatives
to run-of-the-mill criminology.
What, then, is critical criminology? For good reason, the editors of this
compilation are loath to limit an inclusive fi eld of study
by constructing an
exclusionary defi nition. Nonetheless, it would be fair to say, as Robert van
Krieken points out in his own chapter,
that what sets ‘critical’
criminology apart from its garden-variety equivalent is a turn to social theory
and its constituent
discourses. This is something to which
the Critical
Criminology Companion
certainly aspires.
Each of the 26 essays contained in this work is grouped under one of fi ve
distinct themes: ‘Theories and Methodologies of Critical
Criminology’, ‘Critical Theory in Action’, ‘Broadening
Defi nitions of Crime and Criminology’, ‘Responses
and ‘Future Directions in Critical Criminology’. As these broad
thematic concerns indicate, the editors
are conscious of the mutually
reinforcing relationship between theory and practice. While intellectually
driven, the
retains its relevance beyond the confi nes of the
ivory tower.
Among other things, these essays grapple with gendered and racialised
understandings of crime, the uncertain place of international
criminal law in a
politicised world order, the intractability of populist ‘law and
order’ politics, the deleterious effects
of excluding Aboriginal customary
law from the mainstream criminal justice system, masculinised subcultures within
law enforcement
agencies, the potentialities (and limitations) of restorative
justice, and the revivifi cation of class analysis in criminological
Collectively, these essays are nothing short of an intellectual tour de
What makes this compilation truly unique, however, is its willingness to turn
its critical gaze onto its own deep-seated assumptions.
By virtue of this
hypercritical approach, the contributors eschew the constraints of dogma and
ideology in favour of open-ended inquiry
and rigorous scholarship.
A few examples will suffi ce. In his broadbrush analysis of social theory as
it applies to criminology, van Krieken suggests that
critical criminologists
might seriously consider as an object of critique not just the omnipresence of
state oppression, but also
the paucity of social control and government
regulation in riskladen spheres of activity. In her re-evaluation of feminist
criminologies,
Kerry Carrington suggests that sexual assault prevention
campaigns must move beyond simplistically typecasting all men as depraved
perpetratorsin- waiting and all women as choiceless damsels in distress. On the
international front, Mark Findlay argues that the
legitimacy accorded to global
institutions—too often considered a ‘good thing’ by
progressives and internationalists—is
marred by the overt politicisation
of international criminal law, which in turn makes it practically impossible to
keep global governance
just. This is just a small selection of the many
path-breaking and provocative insights to be found in this book.
Like all good works of critical theory, these essays are unapologetically
erudite. At times, their well-considered use of jargon and
terminology can be overwhelming. While the editors of
the Companion
contend that newcomers to the fi eld of criminology have much to learn from
the essays therein, this is a work whose insights can
only be fully appreciated
by criminologists with a sound grasp of their discipline’s core
principles.
On the other hand, there is much to be said for exposing students to critical
criminology at an early stage of their intellectual
development, before the
anodyne assumptions of traditional criminology have come to be taken for
granted. As the editors suggest,
aspiring students will benefi t from reading
this stimulating work alongside an introductory text.
The Companion’s
editors and contributors are to be commended for their willingness to push
beyond the boundaries of tried-but-not-so-true criminology.
scholarship is self-avowedly radical and counter-discursive is
unproblematic— indeed, the periphery has an uncanny
habit of infl uencing
the centre. When the next law and order auction rolls around, we would do well
to take stock of their input.
