Relevant Legislation
“75 Who represents party at pre-hearing conference
Unless the tribunal considers it appropriate in the interests of justice
to allow a party to be represented by a lawyer or other person,
a party must
represent himself or herself at a pre-hearing conference.
76 Who represents party at other proceedings
(1) Subject to
the provisions of an empowering Act or subsection
(2) or (3), in a
proceeding—
(a) a party, other than an individual, appearing before the tribunal may
be represented only by a person who is not a lawyer; and
(b) an individual appearing before the tribunal must represent himself or
(3) An individual appearing before the tribunal may be represented by a
person who is not a lawyer if the tribunal directs that representation
person is appropriate having regard to all the
circumstances
Applicants’ submissions
applicants allege that it is in the interest of justice that they be represented
by Mr Way at all future directions hearings and
the final hearing. They say he
is better equipped to bring to the attention of the Tribunal all relevant
matters; he will be able
to assist in identifying and eliminating irrelevant
material and he should be able to reduce any time wasting.
say the respondent is able to engage Mr Bloomfield as its representative rather
than Mr Surtie thus providing a representative
who is better equipped to conduct
the defence and counterclaim.
applicants submit that it would be unfair if they could not likewise be
permitted to use a representative who could present their
case more ably than
themselves. They submit that Mr Way has provided advice to them as to the
requirements of sections 102 and 103
of the Act and he has conversed by
telephone with Mr Bloomfield as to these relevant matters.
also allege Mr Bloomfield has been belligerent and antagonistic towards
Respondent’s Submissions
respondent says that it is not in the interests of justice to allow another
person to represent the applicants at the pre-hearing
conference, directions
hearing or the hearing. It submits that the applicants are well acquainted with
the procedures especially
Ms Haywood, who has conducted previous applications
without representation; Mr Way does not have any interest in the application,
does not reside at the park; and it is not appropriate having regard to all the
circumstances of the case for Mr Way to represent
them. With respect to the
comment that Mr Bloomfield represented the respondent, it is submitted that this
is proper as he is the
resident manager, has the day to day care of the village
and is referred to in the written material.
respondent objects to the submission that Mr Bloomfield has bullied and used
overbearing tactics and denies that he has so conducted
In summary, it is submitted that there are no special circumstances justifying
the appointment of Mr Way as the representative.
Observations and Findings
individual appearing before the Tribunal may be represented by a person, who is
not a lawyer, if the Tribunal directs that representation
by the person is
appropriate having regard to all the circumstances.
applicants seek an order with respect to the interpretation of section 102 and
103 of the MHRP Act and this is the only order
being sought. The
applicant’s submissions as to the meaning of these sections are based on
the advice given by Mr Way.
Haywood has appeared before the Tribunal in earlier applications and is familiar
with its processes and proceedings.
When this proceeding commenced Ms Haywood was the agreed representative of the
applicants and I am not satisfied there are good reasons
for Mr Way to represent
the four applicants in lieu of Ms Haywood.
Further, both the applicants and the respondent should provide written
submissions on the issues that are raised with respect to
sections 102 and 103
and Mr Way can, if he is so instructed, have an input into the preparation of
these submissions.
is not a case involving complex factual issues and I also doubt whether the
legal issues are complex.
this jurisdiction the parties should be not be discouraged from representing
themselves and it is proper that Mr Bloomfield, the
park manager represent the
corporate respondent.
In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that it is an appropriate case for Mr
Way to represent the four applicants.
application is dismissed.
