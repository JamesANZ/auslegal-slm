REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Helen, Mark and Sharon Frankel (“the applicants”) seek an order to
confirm a proposed rental increase in accordance
with a notice dated 24 November
2008, issued pursuant to
section 71(2)
Manufactured Homes (Residential
Parks) Act 2003
(“MHRP Act”) and forwarded to homeowners Paul
and Sharon Goodwin, Ray and Vilma Plumb and Allan Pickering (“the
respondents”).
application is made pursuant to sections 71(7)-(9) of the MHRP Act.
applicants are the owners of a manufactured home park located at 295 Boat
Harbour Drive, Hervey Bay, known as “The Australiana
Top Tourist
Park” (“the park”) and are park owners as defined in section
11 of the MHRP Act. The park is a residential
park as defined in sections 12 and
the respondents are home owners as defined in section 8 of the MHRP Act.
park contains 106 sites including 32 manufactured home sites, 54 caravan and
other sites and 20 cabins. The park is a mixed use
respect to the 32 manufactured home sites there are two different versions of
site agreements that are in operation but they
all, except one, contain an
identical annual CPI rental adjustment clause.
24 November 2008, the applicants caused a notice to be forwarded to 29
and given outside
the terms of the site rental agreements. The notice was not given to three
the applicants: one site was vacant and one
site was occupied by a new tenant who was paying the higher rent.
The existing rents paid by the 29 home owners varied slightly and it was the
intention of the applicants to increase all site rents
to an equal rent of
$115.00 per week. With respect to the respondents the rents paid were:
Existing Rent: p/w
New Rent: p/w
the 29 home owners, 26 agreed to the proposed increase and the three did
5 February 2009 the applicants filed an application seeking an order affirming
the proposed rental increase with respect to the
respondents. A defence was
filed denying the applicants’ right to increase the rent.
Applicant’s submissions
applicants submitted that there was no provision for a market review rental
increase in the site agreements so the notice was
issued outside the terms of
the site agreements and pursuant to section 71 of the MHRP Act.
It was also submitted that all site agreements contained a CPI rental increase
only and there had never been a market review increase
for the park with the
consequent effect that the rents have fallen below the market rent.
respect to the market rent, the applicants submitted that; Mr Stanaway said the
market rent was in the range of $115.00 to $125.00
per week; the new home owner
was paying the increased rent of $115.00 per week; 89.7% of the owners have
agreed to pay the new rental
of $115.00 per week as and from February 2009; none
of these homeowners are in arrears, none have said they are unable to pay the
rent and none had had to adjust their lifestyle. They also submit that there
has never been a market review rental increase, even
though residential rents in
the locality have increased.
was submitted that I should accept the evidence of the expert as he gave his
evidence honestly and the rental range of between
$115.00 and $125.00 was within
the market parameters as set out in his report. Also they maintain that the
applicants decided to
keep the increase to the lower end of the range.
submitted that significant improvements have been made to the facilities; the
value of the park has increased; the local government
charges have increased
over the last three year period and the increase is fair and equitable in all
the circumstances and is more
than reasonable.
also submitted that I should reject the evidence of the respondents as they have
not provided an expert valuation report of any
alternative market valuation;
filed no evidence of their own financial circumstances showing an inability to
pay or no documentary
evidence to support the claim that they could not afford
the increase.
With respect to the submission that there were two increases in one year or
three increases in one year and one day, the applicants
submit that the new
rental was well below the market rent; the respondents had the advantage of a
low market rent for some period
of time; the applicants chose the lower end of
the range as they knew the CPI increase in July would bring the amount payable
$118.50 still below the market rental or still within the range of market
rental outlined by Mr Stanaway.
submit that 26 other people were paying the rent without objection and it would
be inequitable if an exception were given to
the respondents. They submit that
the rental increase as at 1 July 2008 was 3.04%; the market review in 1 February
2009 was to increase
each party’s rental to $115.00; the amount of
increase varied per the owners as they started from a different base; and the
CPI increase as at 1 July 2009 was 3.1% or $3.50.
Respondents’ submissions
respondents gave separate submissions though Mr Goodwin gave his submissions
first and the others substantially adopted them.
respondents submitted that all site agreements, except one, contained a rental
CPI increases term only; the form two did not provide
a date when the CPI
increase was to take place but it was adjusted every July.
was submitted that; if the applicants were trying to catch-up the low rent, it
should be undertaken gradually; the other residents
agreed to the increase
because of the conduct of the previous owners who wanted to demolish the park
and build townhouses and this
placed enormous pressure on these home owners. In
these circumstances, the other park owners would agree to anything.
It was submitted that not everybody in the park gets rent assistance.
submit Mr Stanaway’s report should be rejected as Lazy Acres and Happy
Wanderers are not comparable parks. It was suggested
that the market rent was
only $110.00 per week as this was the rent payable by the caravan operators
within the park. They submit
the increase from $103.50 to $115.00 or a $12.50
increase was excessive. Furthermore, from July 2006 the increase was from
to $115.00, a 24% increase and with the recent CPI increase the increase
is 27.8%. It was submitted that this increase was excessive
circumstances.
The respondents conceded that there have been minor improvements or changes to
the facilities at the park but these were only in
the tourist areas and not in
the manufactured homes area of the park. The improvements to the pool and other
areas were used by
the tourists only. It was also suggested that the frailty of
the residents means that they do not use these facilities.
The respondents submitted that facilities were removed. They maintain that the
night security was withdrawn by the previous owner
just prior to the new owner
(applicants) taking over. They argue this is a serious problem as Hervey Bay is
a fast growing area
with a crime problem and the park is vulnerably located next
to a four lane highway. Also it was said that the boom gate was not
during the day but was closed with the previous owners. It was submitted that
the security should be tightened up.
respect to the suggestion of a change in operating costs it was submitted that
there was no costings provided and there was
no evidence of these issues.
respondents say it was not fair and equitable to increase the rent by the amount
that is being sought. The market rent is only
an estimate; three increases in
one year and a day is excessive and an increase to $110.00 per week is more
is also submitted that there are 13 single pensioners, they have to rely on
rental assistance and the pension is increased by
a CPI only and is not subject
to a market review.
Pickering said that he couldn’t afford the increase as he had lost money
on the stock market and this has placed him under
financial hardship. Also his
electricity and other costs have gone up recently.
was also submitted that the rental increases and the amounts paid for houses and
units and other properties outside the park was
irrelevant. It was submitted
that the rents paid for houses and units was not a real comparison with what is
being paid by homeowners
in the park.
Observations and Findings
was not argued that the applicants are not entitled to seek a rental increase
pursuant to section 71 of the MHRP Act. Since the
decision of
Palmpoint v The
Residents of Bribie Island Residential Park
[2007] QDC 130
the issue is not
whether an increase can lawfully be made outside the terms of the site
agreements, but after a consideration of the
factors listed in section 70(3),
the amount, if any, of the proposed increase.
find that the applicants did deliver a notice of rental increase pursuant to
section 71 of the MHRP Act 2003, the respondents did
not agree to the proposed
increase and the applicants have applied to the Tribunal for an order affirming
the proposed increase.
In considering this application the Tribunal must have regard to the matters
listed in section 70(3) of the MHRP Act.
The first issue is the range of site rents usually charged at comparable sites
in comparable residential parks in the locality of
the park. Mr Stanaway has
outlined the rents paid at parks located in the Hervey Bay area, including
Torquay Waters Home Park, Happy
Wanderers Village, Lazy Acres Caravan and
Camping Village (“Lazy Acres”), Sugar Coast Village, Hazelmere
Village and
Forest Glen Holiday Resort. The rentals listed in his report were
obtained from the managers at these parks except for the Lazy
Acres as the
manager refused, on the ground of privacy, to disclose the rentals that were
being paid. Mr Stanaway said the rent
paid at Lazy Acres, and disclosed in his
report, of between $103.00 and $120.50 per week, was obtained from the
applicant’s
office staff. To the contrary, Mr Frankel says that the rent
paid at Lazy Acres was $130.00 per week. The respondents sought to
as a credibility issue against Mr Frankel. However, it was acknowledged that it
was not Mr Frankel who provided the information
to Mr Stanaway but an office
staff member or another member of the Frankel family. Due to the uncertainty
surrounding the evidence
of the rent paid at Lazy Acres, the evidence given is
subject to doubt. Mr Stanaway said that the current rental for the Happy
Village was $122.00 per week including GST and he listed the rent paid
at the other parks. According to Mr Stanaway, Happy Wanders
and Lazy Acres were
described as mixed use parks as is the applicants’ park, and I accept this
evidence. By mixed use it means
that there are caravans, manufactured home
sites and other types of sites located at the park.
I accept the evidence of Mr Stanaway that these two parks are comparable, and
even though there is doubt as to the rent payable at
Lazy Acres, I also accept
his evidence that the market rents for the park would be between $115.00 and
$125.00. During cross-examination
I inquired of Mr Stanaway what would be the
figure that could be described as the actual market rent for a site at this park
he said $120.00 per week. I accept his evidence on this issue. To the
contrary, Mr Goodwin said that the market rent should be
$110.00 per week as
this was the rent paid by tourist caravan occupants. I do not accept this
evidence and his submission on this
issue. Section 70 (3) (a) of the MHRP Act
requires an assessment of the rents paid for comparable sites in comparable
residential
parks and the rent paid at a caravan site in the park is not the
rent paid at a comparable site in a comparable residential park
as required by
the section. The rent paid for a caravan site is not comparable to a
manufactured home site. A caravan site may or
may not have toilet, shower and
other facilities attached to the caravan. These bathroom and toilet facilities
may be at the caravan
or may be elsewhere. I am not satisfied that the rents
payable by a caravan occupier is comparable to the rents payable by a homeowner.
I am satisfied that the market rent for the sites at the park would be between
$115.00-$120.00 per week and more particularly $120.00
next issue is the increased site rents compared to the previous site rents. The
prior site rents paid by Mr and Mrs Goodwin,
and by Mr and Mrs Plumb was $99.07,
and by Mr Pickering was $99.60. It was accepted that the rentals paid by the
slightly and it was the intention to increase the rentals so
that all the homeowners were paying the same rent even if the size of
increase varied by only a small amount and the size of each site varied
next issue concerns the frequency and amount of past increases in the site rent
payable under the agreement. It was accepted
that the previous owner did not
seek a CPI increase in 2006. The reason why the then park owner did not claim
an increase was speculative
but it was said that it was due to the fact they
were proposing to demolish all the existing homes and construct townhouses.
that time the rent has been increased by the CPI only. In July 2008 it
was increased by 3.4% and recently as of 1 July 2009 by 3.1%.
next issue concerns the amenity or standard of the common areas and common
facilities. It was submitted by the applicants that
there were improvements to
the park. However, it was conceded that most of these improvements were
maintenance issues and they were
undertaken by the previous owners. A good
example is the pool tiling. Some of the tiles had fallen off and were replaced.
Furthermore,
it was argued that most of these improvements occurred in the
tourist areas and I accept the respondents’ submission with respect
this fact. However, the facilities that were offered were available for use by
all members of the park including the manufactured
accepted that many of the home owners do not use these facilities that are
next issue concerns the question of whether there has been any withdrawal of
facilities or services. The respondents maintain
that security had been removed
in that the night security was taken away by the previous owners and was not
replaced by the applicants
and that the boom gates are now not opened during the
day. Mr Frankel said that he was not aware that the previous owners had night
time roaming security and it was never suggested to him that it be reinstated.
Furthermore, with respect to the boom gates, Mr Frankel
said that the raised
boom gates, allowed for a more eased flow of access to the park and anybody who
visited the park attended the
park office first. He was not aware of any
unwanted visitors entering the park by vehicle and a closed boom gate did not
strangers from walking into the park including persons with a devious
and unlawful intent. I accept that the homeowners are elderly
and security is a
significant issue to them, however night time security and the fact that the
boom gates are open during the day
is not a significant issue to take into
account in assessing the rental increase. If the residents as a group wish that
these services
be reinstated, it should be raised with the applicants.
next issue is the operating costs for the park during the site rent period. The
applicants stated that Government charges have
increased by 38% over the last
three years but there is no evidence of any other cost increases. I accept this
next issue is the just and equitable factor. This highlights many factors
including the impact of the proposed rental increase
on the respondents. I
accept that the proposed increase does have an impact on persons with fixed
incomes especially pensioners.
does impose a financial burden on her. Mr Pickering also said he could not
the increase as he lost money in the recent share crash. However, there
is no evidence of the extent of the loss, how many shares
he owns, did he have
to sell them and why, the balances of his bank accounts, his income levels and
costs of living. I accept that
any increase imposes financial burden on fixed
income pensioners. However, this is one of many factors that must be taken into
further factor is that two increases have occurred within one year or three
increases within one year and one day. This would ordinarily
be a significant
factor, but it also noted that the proposed market review increase was to
$115.00, the bottom end of the market
range of $115.00 to $125.00. And even with
the recent increase to $118.50 per week, the rental paid is still below the
market rent.
In these circumstances, this submission does not carry a
significant weight.
In these cases there is a need to consider and balance all the factors. On the
one hand, park owners must be able to run their business
at a profit and on the
other side of the equation proposed rental increases are subject to the factors
listed in section 70(3) of
the MHRP Act. Taking all these factors into account,
and especially the market rent at $120.00 per week, I am satisfied that the
proposed rental increase to $115.00 per week is reasonable in the circumstances
and should be affirmed.
proposed rental increase for Mr and Mrs Goodwin from $99.07 to $115.00 per week
is affirmed.
proposed rental increase for Mr and Mrs Plumb from $99.07 to $115.00 per week is
proposed rental increase for Mr Pickering from $99.60 to $115.00 is affirmed
