Appeal Outcome
Appeal dismissed. See [22], [105], [106].
At the time of the offences, the respondent, Mr
Bugmy, was a remand prisoner at Broken Hill Correctional Centre.[34] The
was ‘upset’ that a proposed visitor might not be able to
arrive before visiting hours ended.[35] Senior Correctional
Officer (SCO) Gould
offered to find out from Senior Officer Merton whether the visiting hours could
be extended to ‘accommodate’
the visitor’s later arrival.[35]
The offender followed SCO Gould into the wing in which the office was located.
The offender
was prohibited from entering the office and responded with various
threats, including to ‘split [him] open.’[37] SCO
Gould contacted
his superior, Assistant Superintendent Pitt and advised him that the emergency
team may be required in the wing.[38]
The offender left the wing and
made a telephone call to his girlfriend, during which the offender again
threatened to ‘split
Gould open.’[39] Officers Pitt and Donnelly
then entered the yard and Officer Pitt asked the offender at the end of the
call, ‘How did you go?’ The offender replied, ‘That
cocksucker, I’ll get him.’[39] Officer Pitt explained
that he meant
the phone call, to which the offender replied, ‘Come on, you want a piece
of me, I’ll split you c_ _ t.’[40]
The offender ran to a nearby pool
table and threw two pool balls at Officers Pitt and Donnelly, one of which
‘narrowly missed’
Officer Pitt.[41] This conduct constituted Counts
At this point, SCO Gould had entered the yard after Officers
Pitt and Donnelly called for assistance. The offender began throwing
in the direction of SCO Gould and said: ‘Gould you c_ _ t, I told you I am
going to split you open.’[43] The
offender threw two balls that struck SCO
Gould in the back. SCO Gould went into the office and attempted to close the
door, at which
point the offender threw ‘one or two’ balls at SCO
Gould, one of which hit SCO Gould in the left eye.[44] This conduct
constituted
Count 3. The ball was subsequently found ‘broken into three
pieces.’[45]
SCO Gould’s eye injury was very serious, forcing
him to have multiple operations, including a bone graft and the insertion of
metal plates into his orbital floor and cheek. He also had to be put on the
waiting list for a corneal tissue transplant.[47] In
addition, SCO Gould
suffered ongoing psychological issues and effectively lost his career.[49]
District Court of New South Wales
The offender pleaded
guilty at the earliest opportunity [28] for two offences contrary to
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) of assaulting a Corrective Services Officer and
one offence contrary to
Crimes Act 1900
causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily
The offender was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of
eight months in respect of the first two counts and a sentence of six
imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years in respect of the third
count.[3] His Honour allowed a discount of 25 per
cent for an early plea of
His Honour also recommended as a condition of release on
parole that the offender undergo full-time residential
rehabilitation.[78]
Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of
Criminal Appeal
The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against
the original sentence pursuant to the provisions of
Appeal Act 1912
(NSW). The ground of appeal was that ‘the sentence
imposed was manifestly inadequate.’[30] Three further grounds were
as follows:
(i) His Honour failed properly to determine the objective seriousness of the
(ii) His Honour failed properly to acknowledge the category of the victim as a
serving Prison Officer in the lawful performance of
his duty; and
(iii) The weight his Honour afforded the offender’s subjective case
impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence.
October 2012, the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal in
relation to Count 3 and quashed the sentence
on that count, substituting a more
severe sentence of a non-parole period of five years with a balance of a term of
two years and
six months.[5] The appeal against Counts 1 and 2 was
dismissed.[31]
In coming to this conclusion, the Court determined that
the three further grounds of appeal were made out. The Court concluded that
‘the primary judge erred in finding that the offence was at or about the
mid-range of seriousness...and should have concluded
that the offence was
somewhere between mid-range and somewhat above mid-range.’[6] The Court
also concluded that ‘[the
primary judge] erred in taking into account the
respondent’s mental illness...in circumstances where it was conceded his
illness was nothing to do with the offence.’[7]
The offender
sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia, which was granted by the
Court of Criminal Appeal.[32]
High Court of Australia
High Court described the three further grounds of appeal as ‘particulars
of manifest inadequacy’ and concluded that
the Court of Criminal Appeal
erred in resentencing without deciding whether the sentence was manifestly
inadequate.[9] The High Court
also concluded that the Court of Criminal Appeal
erred in stating that ‘the evidence of the offender’s deprived
lost much of its force when viewed in light of his previous
offences.’[9]
The Court remitted the matter to the Court of
Criminal Appeal to deal with ‘in accordance with law.’[32] The
consideration were:
(i) Whether the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly
inadequate; and
(ii) If so, whether the Court should decline to resentence the offender in
exercise of its residual discretion.[11]
to the Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal
considered the following matters on remitter.

Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background of the offender
and/or indicators of disadvantage
Bathurst CJ stated that in
reaching a decision on whether a sentence is manifestly inadequate, ‘it is
necessary to take the
respondent’s subjective circumstances into
account’ and that, in doing so, ‘weight must be given to the
deprived background.’[16] In this regard, Bathurst CJ
noted that whilst the offender’s inability to control his frustration
reduced his moral culpability in terms of understanding his inability to control
his frustration, it also highlighted ‘the
need to take into account the
protection of the community and the need for personal deterrence.’[16]
In his reasoning, Rothman J recalled remarks made by the sentencing
judge on the offender’s sentence. The sentencing judge considered
offender’s ‘subjective circumstances’ in depth,[52] including
the offender’s exposure to ‘significant
violence and alcohol
abuse’ in his early life,[53] the offender’s education being limited
to Year Seven and consequent
poor literacy and numeracy skills,[53] the
offender’s use of cannabis and alcohol at age 12 and substance
dependency,[54] a
lack of past rehabilitation,[55] the offender’s
psychiatric state,[56] the offender being of ‘Aboriginal descent’
and that the offender had grown up in circumstances of ‘social
deprivation’ in a ‘dysfunctional environment associated
with alcohol
and abuse.’[58]
The Crown raised the proposition that too much
weight had been placed on the subjective circumstances of the offender in the
process.[90] The Crown was critical of the degree to which the
primary judge took into account the offender’s psychiatric issues
‘in circumstances where the psychiatric reports referred to
“probable” and “likely” diagnoses,’
because of the
difficult conditions under which the offender was assessed.[88] However, Rothman
J said in response that the sentencing
judge was entitled to take into account
the psychiatrist’s comments in the manner in which he did, citing a
similar discussion
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (Cth) v De La
[2010] NSWCCA 194.
The Crown further submitted that the
offender’s sentencing process ‘required greater emphasis on
denunciation, deterrence
and protection of the community,’[92] regardless
of the High Court’s endorsement of
[2013] NSW SC 1940
(1992) 76 A Crim R
In response to that submission, the offender submitted that the
circumstances of disadvantage of the Aboriginal community are
because of their history of dispossession and that such
unique circumstances should also be taken into account. Rothman J determined
that this submission of the offender was not only contrary to the High
Court’s comments in
Munda v State of Western Australia
, but also ‘illogical.’[93] His Honour reasoned that even if
dispossession is accepted to be a disadvantage suffered uniquely
by persons of
Aboriginal descent, it could not, of itself, be a matter relevant to
sentencing.[94] Rothman J accepted that whilst
Aboriginal people were subject to
dispossession, others living in Australia had also previously been
dispossessed.[95] His Honour
said that, in any case, ‘[r]elevant to
sentencing is the effect of any issues or disadvantage on the offender, not its
uniqueness.’[96]
No evidence was provided before the Court to suggest that
dispossession, of itself, had an effect on the offender’s offending.
Rothman J recognised the possibility of allowing the proposition that
the offender had suffered other disadvantages ‘relevant
to his moral
culpability and inability to control violent impulses.’[97] However, no
such evidence or submissions were made
before the Court.[97]
also discussed the ‘exceptional’ nature of the sentence structure
imposed by the sentencing judge,[79] who recommended
full-time residential
rehabilitation for the offender upon release on parole.[78] In Rothman J’s
opinion, this was a reflection
of ‘His Honour’s significant
experience in criminal law and in the conditions appropriate in rural New South
Wales, particularly
for Aboriginal offenders.’[79]
The fact, if it be the fact, that dispossession is a disadvantage suffered
uniquely by persons of Aboriginal descent in Australia
cannot, without more, be
a matter relevant to sentencing. Sentencing synthesises the issues of objective
seriousness and the issues
of relevance in the subjective circumstances of the
offender.[94]
There can be no doubt that Aborigines were dispossessed (see
Queensland (No 2)
[1992] HCA 23
(1992) 175 CLR 1).
But others may have
been dispossessed from other lands and now live in Australia.[95]
Relevant to sentencing is the effect of any issues or disadvantage on the
offender, not its uniqueness. ... It is just as illogical
to take account of a
unique disadvantage solely on that basis as it is to refuse to take account of a
relevant disadvantage simply
because it is unique.[96]
Rehabilitation
The inadequacy of the non-parole period is ameliorated significantly by the
condition imposed by his Honour of full-time rehabilitation
during the parole
period. There can be little doubt that his Honour’s experience in criminal
law and in rural New South Wales
has been used to fashion a sentence that his
Honour considered most appropriate for the offence committed and the particular
circumstances
of the offender. Of itself, that condition renders the sentence
imposed exceptional.[100]
Grounds of appeal
sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.[73] The particulars included:
(i) That his Honour erred in determining ‘the objective criminality of the
offence as “slightly less serious” than
the mid-range of
seriousness’;[80]
(ii) That his Honour erred in finding that ‘the offence was committed in
the “spur of the moment;”’[85]
(iii) That his Honour ‘failed to sufficiently acknowledge the
victims’ position as law enforcement officers’;[87]
(iv) That his Honour erred in the manner in which he dealt with the
offender’s psychiatric issues;[88] and
(v) That his Honour’s sentencing placed too much weight on the subjective
circumstances of the offender.[90]
Unsuccessful
Whilst the Court was ultimately
satisfied that the sentence imposed on the offender was manifestly
inadequate,[17] [99] each judge
opted to exercise the residual discretion and
therefore dismissed the appeal.[22] [105] [106] Bathurst CJ noted that the
significant
delay in the proceedings[19] and the fact that the offender was
eligible for parole on 8 April 2015[20] were factors supporting the
exercise of
the residual discretion to dismiss the appeal. He also noted that, as the
purpose of a Crown sentence appeal is to lay
down relevant principles for the
guidance of sentencing courts[18] and such guidance had already been given by
the High Court in
this instance, there were no further reasons for this Court to
resentence.[21] Rothman J agreed that the residual discretion should
exercised, taking into account the condition imposed by the sentencing judge of
full-time rehabilitation during the parole period,[100]
the significant delay
since the offender pleaded guilty to the charges[101] and the significant
alteration in the Crown’s submissions,
noting that ‘even the
Crown’s attitude to the application of the
altered between the sentencing judge and the first Court of Criminal Appeal
hearing and altered again in the High Court.’[102]
As to the above
particulars of the appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal found:
(i) Unsuccessful
Rothman J recalled the principle in
[2009] NSWCCA 94
that ‘the assessment of objective
seriousness of an offence is one that is typically part of the role of a
sentencing judge
and this Court is extremely slow to determines such matters for
itself or to set aside the judgment made at first instance.’[84]
Honour determined that ‘the assessment of the objective seriousness of the
offence did not involve any identifiable error
of principle,’ nor did it
take into account ‘any irrelevant matter or fail to take account of any
relevant matter.’[82]
(ii) Unsuccessful
Rothman J noted that his Honour found that
‘the offence arose due to the respondent’s reaction to the inability
him visitor access’ and agreed with the sentencing judge that
this ‘is a mitigating factor pursuant to the terms of s
21A(3)(b) of the
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.’[86]
(iii) Unsuccessful
Rothman J observed that his Honour
‘described the victims’ employment and that their employment as
correctional services
officers was an aggravating factor’ and that it is
‘not clear from the Crown submission what more the Crown says his
could have done.’[87]
(iv) Unsuccessful
Rothman J determined that ‘his Honour
was entitled to take into account the comments of the forensic
psychiatrist’ in
the manner in which he did.[89]
(v) Successful
Rothman J observed that ‘it is
insufficient for this Court to come to a view, simply, that the Court would have
imposed a more
severe sentence. The sentence must be plainly unjust.’[98]
In consequence, his Honour held that the nature of the offence was
extremely serious one’ that inflicted a ‘debilitating’ injury,
and that this would ordinarily be sufficient
reason to interfere with the
original sentence imposed.[99] However, in these circumstances the Court opted
not to interfere with
the offender’s original sentence in exercise of its
residual discretion.
