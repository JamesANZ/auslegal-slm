Freedom of Information Act 1991
Application for access
application under the
Freedom of Information Act 1991
) the applicant requested access from the agency to:
the CCTV footage of my attendance in the public areas of the Murray Bridge court
on the 6/12/22.
the CCTV footage of my court attendance at Murray Bridge court on the 6/12/22.
ease of reference, procedural steps relating to the application and the external
review are set out in Appendix 1.
external review is within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman as a relevant review
authority under section 39 of the FOI Act.
Provisional
determination
provided my tentative view about the agency’s determination to the
parties, by my provisional determination dated 21 February
2023. I informed the
parties that subject to my receipt and consideration of submissions from the
parties I proposed to confirm the
agency’s determination.
email dated 21 February 2023 the applicant provided a response, stating that
because the recorded court proceedings are open to
the public, access to those
records cannot be refused. As has been explained to the applicant on numerous
occasions, a request made
under the FOI Act must be dealt with according to the
provisions of that Act. If I am satisfied that a document is exempt, I do not
have the power to determine that the document should be
this case, as was set out in my provisional determination and will be repeated
in this determination, the requested CCTV footage
from inside the courtrooms
very clearly falls within the exemption of clause 11(a). Accordingly, even
though the court proceedings
were open to the public, I am only able to
determine that the CCTV recordings of those proceedings are exempt.
applicant also submits that because the court proceedings are open to the
public, the images of people attending those proceedings
cannot be said to
concern their personal affairs. I reject this submission; the definition of
personal affairs extends to ‘matters
of private concern to an
individual’.
I am satisfied
that a person’s court appearance would be of private concern to them, even
if the court proceedings were open
to the public.
am not persuaded by the applicant’s submissions to alter the views
expressed in my provisional determination. I did not receive
a response from the
agency. Accordingly, this determination is in the same terms as my provisional
determination.
Relevant law
person has a legally enforceable right to be given access to an agency’s
documents in accordance with the FOI
FOI Act provides that upon receipt of an access application, an agency may make
a determination to refuse access where the documents
are ‘exempt’.
Schedule 1 lists various exemption clauses which may be claimed by an agency as
a basis for refusing access.
following clause of Schedule 1 of the FOI Act are relevant to my external
6—Documents affecting personal affairs
(1) A document is an exempt document if it contains matter the disclosure of
which would involve the unreasonable disclosure of information
concerning the
personal affairs of any person (living or dead).
11—Documents relating to judicial functions etc
A document is an exempt document if it contains matter—
(a) relating to the judicial functions of a court or tribunal; or
(b) prepared for the purposes of proceedings (including any transcript of the
proceedings) that are being heard or are to be heard
before a court or tribunal;
(c) prepared by or on behalf of a court or tribunal (including any order or
judgment made or given by the court or tribunal) in relation
to proceedings that
are being heard or have been heard before the court or tribunal.
section 48, the onus is on the agency to justify its determination ‘in any
proceedings’. This includes the external
review process.
39(11) provides that the Ombudsman may confirm, vary or reverse the
agency’s determination in an external review, based
on the circumstances
existing at the time of review.
Documents in
agency identified 17 documents within the scope of the application.
Issues in this review
regard to the agency’s submissions and the exemption clauses provided in
Schedule 1 of the FOI Act, it is for me to determine
whether to confirm, vary or
reverse the agency’s determination in regard to the documents in issue in
this external review.
Consideration
agency identified 14 documents as falling within the scope of part 1 of the FOI
application and submits that 1 document can be
fully released and 13 documents
can be partially released. The redactions applied to the 13 documents have been
made on the basis
of clause 6(1).
agency submits that:
The CAA is required to redact images of any person that is not Mr Woidt, a
Sheriff’s Officer, or a Police Officer in unform
[sic]. This includes any
third parties contained in the footage that have not provided the CAA with
permission to release their image.
The information is obtained involuntarily in circumstances that often the
person would not voluntarily wish to be in, and it is collected
in circumstances
which makes it impossible to consult them or allow them to inform the agency as
to why the information is sensitive
or would be an unreasonable disclosure of
personal affairs.
The location as a court is identifiable from the footage and any identifiable
person appearing on that footage contains information
concerning the personal
affairs of that person. There are numerous reasons for which a person’s
attendance at a Court may be
sensitive, and similarly many possible reasons that
the person would not want that information disclosed.
agree with the agency’s submissions. Very clearly a person’s
attendance at a court would be of private concern to that
person (unless their
attendance is in an occupational or professional
and as such I am
satisfied that footage showing a person’s image at a court location
constitutes their personal affairs.
am also satisfied that disclosure of the images of other people would be
unreasonable noting that:
the sensitivity
of the information
the fact that
there are no reasonably practicable steps that either the agency or myself could
take to undertake consultation with
those individuals
the fact that
the images can be redacted without otherwise interfering with the footage of the
circumstances in which the footage was obtained.
agency advised that three documents were identified as falling within the scope
of part 2 of the FOI application, and that all
three documents are fully exempt
on the basis of clause 11(a).
the term ‘judicial functions’ is not defined in the South Australian
FOI Act, the equivalent New South Wales
legislation defines the term as follows:
judicial functions
, in relation to a court, means such of the
functions of the court as relate to the hearing or determination of proceedings
it, and includes –
(a) In relation to a Magistrate – such of the functions of the Magistrate
as relate to the conduct of committal proceedings;
(b) In relation to a coroner – such of the functions of the coroner as
relate to the conduct of inquests and inquiries under
Coroners Act
definition has also been adopted in numerous cases and I am satisfied that it
provides useful guidance in the absence of a definition
of ‘judicial
functions’ within the South Australian FOI Act. Having formed the view
that the above definition is appropriate
in this context, I have afforded
‘judicial functions’ that definition in the context of the SA FOI
section 39(15) of the FOI Act prevents me from disclosing the content of the
documents claimed to be exempt, it is clear
from the wording of the FOI
application that these three documents consist of CCTV footage which captures
the applicant’s court
appearance on 6 December 2022.
clearly this footage relates to the judicial functions of a court as it captures
the hearing and/or determination of proceedings
before it. The documents are
therefore fully exempt on the basis of clause 11(a).
Determination
light of my views above, I confirm the agency’s determination.
