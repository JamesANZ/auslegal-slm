Happy Cruising Pty Ltd v Magistrates Court of Western Australia & Anor [2025] HCADisp 268 (6 November 2025)
HAPPY CRUISING PTY LTD
MAGISTRATES
COURT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA & ANOR
[2025] HCADisp
applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from the whole of the judgment of the Court
of Appeal of the Supreme
Court of Western Australia (Mitchell, Hall and Archer JJA), which dismissed
an appeal from the Supreme Court
of Western Australia (Lemonis J).
proposed appeal does not raise any issue of principle and has insufficient
prospects of success to warrant a grant of special
leave. It would therefore be
futile to grant the extension of time that is sought.
leave to appeal is refused with costs.
