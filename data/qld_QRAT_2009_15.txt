RACING APPEALS TRIBINAL
NOTICE OF DECISION
27 August 2009
Nathan Bryan GOODWIN
Greyhound Racing Authority
APPEARANCES
Mr Trevor Kyle, Solicitor, appeared on behalf of the Appellant
Mr Zac Bryson, Steward, appeared on behalf of the Respondent
DECISION BEING APPEALED
3 months’ suspension and $2000 fine
REASONS FOR DECISION - Amended
Mr Leo Williams AO, Chairman
This is an appeal by Mr Nathan Goodwin against the severity of a sentence
imposed on him by the Stewards following conviction for
a breach of Rule
83(2)(a)(d) in that he presented a greyhound at a meeting at a time when it had
in its system a prohibited substance,
namely Methyltestosterone. The substance
showed up on a post-race swab.
Methyltestosterone is a prohibited substance within the meaning of the Rule.
Mr Kyle, representing the appellant, pressed the Tribunal to accept the
explanation given by the appellant, namely that the process
of feeding of the
dog in question (Thanks Mick) had led to a mistake whereby it had received a
feed intended for a female dog. The
principal use of the drug in question is to
regulate female dogs. The drug in question is administered under the brand name
” Canitone” and comes in tablet form
Mr Goodwin was not able to produce the tablets to the stewards as he stated he
thrown them away

Mr Kyle was critical of the Stewards for imposing the penalty of 3
months’ suspension together with a fine of $2000 on the basis
had not sufficiently taken account of either the effects of the drug and its
potential use or of the antecedents of the
appellant in respect of his
previously good record.
Mr Goodwin’s record is indeed clean, having been a trainer for 17 years
and involved in or about various forms of the racing
industry for quite a long
Looking at the penalty as it stands and having regard to comparative
penalties for like offences, it is the view of the Tribunal that
the Stewards
have acted reasonably. They have suspended, not disqualified, the appellant for
a period of 3 months rather than 6 months,
and have imposed a fine which is not
excessive, having regard to the nature of the drug and its potential effect on
the animal in
It is therefore the Tribunal’s conclusion that the appeal be dismissed
and the deposit forfeit.
