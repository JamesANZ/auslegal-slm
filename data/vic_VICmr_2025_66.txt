Reasons for Decision
Background to review
Applicant made a request to the Agency seeking access to the following
“Documents dated/created between [dates]:
I would like the engineers/engineering reports including third party and
photos, which were provided to the Whitehorse Council by
[named person] [phone
number] of [an address in Melbourne], relating to Building Notice [reference]
[an address in Melbourne]
• Yes, I confirm the above interpretation
• Yes, I wish to exclude personal affairs information
• Yes, I give Council permission to advise third parties that I am
seeking access
• I have been requested by OVIC to make this application, Office of the
Victorian Information Commission”.
Agency identified one document falling with the terms of the Applicant’s
request and refused access to it in full under
sections 33(1) and 35(1)(b). The
Agency’s decision letter sets out the reasons for its decision.
Review application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under section 49A(1) of
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
have examined a copy of the document subject to review.
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section
49H(2) in relation to the review.
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
Initial view
[date], the Applicant was provided an initial view by OVIC staff that the
document would likely be held to be exempt in full under
sections 33(1) and
Applicant was invited to agree to withdraw their application or seek a formal
written notice of decision. The Applicant was also
invited to provide any
further information they would like to be considered prior to the decision on
review being made.
the same date, the Applicant replied that they would like to proceed with a
formal review. The Applicant did not provide any further
information for
OVIC’s consideration.
Review of exemptions
Section 33(1) – Documents affecting personal privacy of third
33(1) protects an individual’s privacy where their right to privacy
outweighs the public interest in disclosing their
information.
This will only occur
when disclosing the individual’s personal affairs information is
unreasonable.
document or information is exempt under section 33(1) if two conditions are
(a) the document or information relates to the ‘personal affairs’ of
a natural person (living or deceased)
(b) disclosure of that personal affairs information is unreasonable in all the
circumstances.
more information about section 33(1) see the FOI
Guidelines.
document contain personal affairs information of other individuals?
concept of personal affairs information is broad. Information will relate to the
personal affairs of a person if it ‘concerns
or affects that person as an
individual’.
This includes
information relating to health, private behaviour, home life, or personal or
family relationships of
individuals.
document will indirectly disclose personal affairs information if it contains
information from which any person’s identity,
address or location can
reasonably be determined. This means that a document can be exempt under section
33(1) where the document
itself does not contain personal affairs information,
but its disclosure would reveal personal affairs information.
note the Applicant agreed to exclude personal affairs information from the
document. However, having considered the content of the
document, which is a
covering email and a report on a shared fence with a third party property owner,
I am satisfied the document
in its entirety concerns the personal affairs
information of a third party. This is because as well as directly identifying
information,
it relates to information that most people would find personal and
sensitive, being their home. I therefore consider the Applicant
personal affairs information and have proceeded with the review on that
Would disclosure of the personal affairs information be
unreasonable?
determining whether disclosure of the personal affairs information would be
unreasonable in the circumstances, I have considered
the following factors:
(a) the nature of the personal affairs information
(b) the circumstances in which the information was obtained
(c) the extent to which the information is available to the public
(d) the Applicant’s interest in the information
(e) whether any public or important interest would be promoted by release of the
information
(f) whether the individuals to whom the information relates object, or would be
likely to object, to the release of the information
(g) whether disclosure of the information would or would be reasonably likely to
endanger the life or physical safety of any person.
have decided it would be unreasonable to release the document for the following
(a) The document is an email and a report prepared by a contractor engaged by a
third party. The information was provided to the
Agency in the course of
carrying out its regulatory functions in relation to building matters.
(b) As described above, I consider the information is sensitive and personal as
it relates to a third party’s home.
(c) While I note some of the information would be known to the Applicant or
other members of the public where it is visible from
the street or neighbouring
properties, I consider the information specifically sought by the Applicant is
not information available
to the public.
(d) The Applicant seeks access to the document in response to a building notice
and enforcement action issued by the Agency. The
Applicant is of the opinion
that the Agency requires them to undertake the replacement of their retaining
wall without providing
supporting evidence. I acknowledge the Applicant’s
interest in obtaining access to the information. However, this factor must
weighed against other relevant factors.
(e) While I note the Applicant’s interest in obtaining access to
information that concerns the adjoining wall with the property
next to theirs, I
do not consider the public interest would be promoted by the release of the
requested document.
(f) I consider that in similar cases the public interest may lie in favour of
disclosure of information that supports an Agency [building
notice] decision.
However, in this instance there are other factors that I must consider, such as
the sensitivity of the specific
circumstances of this matter.
(g) In this instance, weighing all the above factors, I have decided that the
third party’s privacy outweighs the public interest
in disclosure.
I consider disclosure of the personal affairs information in the document would
be unreasonable to release, the document is exempt
under section
Section 35(1)(b) – Information obtained in
document may be exempt under section 35(1)(b) if two conditions are
(a) disclosure would divulge information or matter:
(i) communicated in confidence
(ii) by or on behalf of a person or a government to an agency or a Minister
(b) disclosure would be contrary to the public interest because the
disclosure would be
reasonably likely to impair the ability of an agency
or a Minister to obtain similar information in the future.
Was the information obtained in confidence?
information was communicated in confidence is a question of
determined from the
perspective of the
communicator.
considered the content and context of the document, I am satisfied the third
party who communicated information to the Agency
did so in a voluntary basis
where confidentiality could be implied.
Would disclosure impair
the ability of the Agency to obtain similar information?
term ‘impair’ is not defined in the FOI Act. However, case law
(a) the degree of impairment must go beyond a trifling or minimal
(b) there must be an actual impairment to the ability of the agency to obtain
similar information in the
(c) it is not enough that individuals would be less candid than they otherwise
or would feel
resentment at having their confidence
(d) the necessary level of impairment will be made out if a significant minority
of persons in the relevant group would be firmly
resistant to providing similar
information in the future
(e) it is the agency that must be impaired from receiving information, not
simply a reluctance on the part of a supplier to provide
information
(f) the existence of a statutory duty to provide information does not
necessarily exclude the possibility that disclosure would be
reasonably likely
to impair an agency’s ability to obtain similar information in the future,
particularly where disclosure
might impact the quality and quantity of any
future information provided.
comparison, an agency will not be impaired from obtaining a specific type of
information in future, if there is legislation which
compels a person to provide
this type of information to the
again acknowledge the Applicant’s interest in receiving access to the
document under the FOI Act. However, I am of the view
that if such a document
was released under the FOI Act that there is a real possibility that the Agency
would be impaired from obtaining
similar information in the future, noting the
information was communicated voluntarily and with an expectation of
confidentiality.
consider there is a public interest in ensuring that people are uninhibited from
making complaints, so that the Agency can serve
its constituents and meet its
regulatory obligations.
am therefore satisfied the document is also exempt under section
Section 25 – Deletion of exempt or irrelevant
information
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
whether it is ‘practicable’ to delete exempt or irrelevant
information requires an agency or Minister to consider:
(a) the effort involved in making the deletions from a resources point of
(b) the effectiveness of those deletions – that is, whether the edited
document still has meaning.
have considered the effect of deleting exempt information from the document. In
my view, it is not practicable for the Agency to
delete the exempt information,
because deleting the exempt information would render the document meaningless
and would not contain
the information the Applicant is specifically
the information before me, I am satisfied the document is exempt from release
under sections 33(1) and 35(1)(b).
I am satisfied it is not practicable to provide the Applicant with an edited
copy of the document with exempt information deleted

25, access is refused in full.
