FERNANDA DA COSTA GOMES
MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP, MIGRANT
SERVICES AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL
JUDGE KENDALL
DATE OF ORDER:
THE COURT ORDERS THAT:
1. The application for an order pursuant to
Migration Act
(Cth) is dismissed.
REASONS FOR
JUDGE KENDALL:
1 An accurate summary of the background to this
matter is provided in written submissions filed on behalf of the first
in this matter (the “Minister”) dated 10 August 2021 at
[1] to [13]. The Court has reviewed the Court Book (“CB”)
and adopts that summary as its own. With some additions and alterations that
summary provides, relevantly, as follows.
2 The applicant is a citizen of Brazil (by birth) and a citizen of Italy (by
descent) (CB 11 & 21-22). She arrived in Australia
as the holder
of a Student visa in June 2014 (CB 27 & 29). She completed a Diploma of
Hospitality in Australia in September 2015
3 On 11 November 2016, the applicant applied for a Regional Employer
Nomination (subclass 187) visa (the “visa”) (CB 10-20).
nominated occupation was Café or Restaurant Manager with the related
employer’s name listed as Pancakes at Carillon
(CB 14-16).
4 On 6 April 2018, the Department of Home Affairs invited the applicant to
comment on the following information (CB 58-61):
Nomination refused
The nomination submitted to the department by The Trustee for Panpal Unit Trust
listing you as their Nominee has been refused. This
means that your visa
application cannot be approved.
5 The applicant did not provide a response to the invitation to comment.
6 On 8 June 2016, a delegate of the Minister refused to grant the applicant
the visa (CB 68-70). The delegate was not satisfied that
the applicant met cl
187.233 of the
Migration Regulations 1994
“Regulations”). That is, the delegate was not satisfied that the
applicant was the subject of an approved
nomination.
7 On 20 June 2018, the applicant applied to the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) for review of the delegate’s
decision. She did so with the assistance of a migration agent (CB 71-72).
8 On 25 June 2018, the Tribunal sent an email to the applicant’s
migration agent acknowledging the application and attaching
a letter to the
applicant asking her to provide any material or written arguments she wished the
Tribunal to consider (CB 73-76).
9 In a separate proceeding (on 28 September 2020), the Tribunal affirmed a
separate delegate’s decision made on 6 April 2018
that rejected The
Trustee for Panpal’s Unit Trust’s application for approval of the
nomination of a position in Australia
under reg 5.19 of the Regulations:
Trustee for Panpal Unit Trust (Migration)
[2020] AATA 4050.
10 On 18 February 2021, the Tribunal sent an email to the applicant’s
agent attaching an invitation for the applicant to attend
a hearing (CB 92-95).
The invitat
ion noted the time and date of the hearing and
asked the applicant to complete the enclosed ‘Response to hearing
invitation’
form and return it to the Tribunal within 7 days of receipt of
the letter. The letter noted that the applicant should provide all
documents she
intended to rely on at least 7 days before the scheduled hearing. The applicant
was advised that the hearing was scheduled
for 26 March 2021 and would be
conducted via telephone.
11 On 22 February 2021 the Tribunal sent a further email to the
applicant’s agent attaching another letter to the applicant
(CB 96-99).
That letter was an invitation to comment or respond to the following information
The application for approval of the nominated position
made by The Trustee for Panpal Unit Trust (the nominator) was refused by a
delegate of the Minister for Immigration. The nominator sought a review of that
decision but it was recently affirmed by the AAT.
This means that the
nominator’s application for the nominated position has not been approved.
The invitation to comment requested a response by 9 March 2021 (CB 98). The
Tribunal also advised as follows:
If we do not receive your
comments or response within the period allowed or as extended, we may make a
decision on the review without
taking any further action to obtain your views on
the information
. You will also lose any entitlement you might otherwise have
had under the
Migration Act 1958
to appear before us to give evidence and
present arguments.
12 The applicant did not provide a response to the Tribunal.
13 On 11 March 2021, the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the
applicant the visa (CB 104-107).
14 On 16 April 2021, the applicant applied for judicial review of the
Tribunal’s decision in this Court.
15 The applicant filed her application 1 day outside of the 35 day time limit
specified in
Migration Act 1958
“Act”). Accordingly, the applicant requires an extension of time to
pursue these proceedings.
16 This judgment addresses whether the applicant should be granted an
extension of time within which to file her substantive application
for judicial
review. For the reason that follow, the Court is not satisfied that an extension
of time should be granted. The materials
before the Court include the
substantive application for judicial review dated 15 April 2021 (and filed on
16 April 2021), a Court
Book numbering 108 pages (marked as Exhibit 1), and
written submissions filed by the Minister on 10 August 2021.
17 At the hearing, the applicant appeared without legal representation. The
applicant confirmed to the Court that she had received
a copy of the Court Book
and the Minister’s written submissions.
CONSIDERATION - EXTENSION OF TIME APPLICATION
Section 477(2)
of the Act provides:
The Federal Circuit Court may, by order, extend that 35
day period as the Federal Circuit Court considers appropriate if:
(a) an application for that order has been made in writing to the Federal
Circuit Court specifying why the applicant considers that
it is necessary in the
interests of the administration of justice to make that order; and
(b) the Federal Circuit is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of
the administration of justice to make the order.
19 In this matter the applicant requested an extension of time in writing and
explained why that extension should be granted.
Section 477(2)(a)
of the Act is
thus satisfied. In those circumstances, the Court must determine whether it is
“in the interests of the administration
of justice” to grant an
extension of time:
s 477(2)(b)
of the Act.
20 Noting that the applicant was unrepresented, the Court explained to her
that the matters it may consider in this regard are not
limited. However, as
outlined in the decision in
Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen
(1984) 3 FCR 344, the Court will usually consider the following factors when
determining whether an extension of time should be granted:
(a) the length of delay and any prejudice to the
(b) whether the explanation for the delay is “adequate”; and
(c) whether the proposed substantive application for judicial review has
21 The Court notes that the applicant’s affidavit (which accompanied
her substantive application) does not explain the delay
or why it was in the
interests of the administration of justice for an extension of time to be
granted. While the applicant is required
to do so pursuant to r 44.05(2)(c)
Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001
(Cth), the Court can dispense
with compliance of this requirement if deemed appropriate. The Court does so
22 The Court invited the applicant to address each of the factors outlined
above and to highlight “anything else” she
considered relevant to
her application for an extension of time. The applicant’s responses are
discussed in the consideration
that follows.
Delay and Explanation
23 As outlined above, the statutory time period
within which the applicant can seek judicial review in this Court is 35 days
the date of the decision: s 477(1) of the Act. Here, the Tribunal made its
decision on 11 March 2021 and notified the applicant of
its decision on
15 March 2021 (CB 101-108). Section 368(2) of the Act provides that
the decision is taken to be made on the day the
written statement is made. The
Tribunal made its written statement on 11 March 2021 (CB 104-108).
24 The applicant was thus required to file her application for judicial
review on or before
15 April 2021. The applicant lodged her application for
review on 16 April 2021. This is a delay of one day.
25 The delay here is minor. This weighs in favour of granting the extension
26 In relation to “why” the substantive application was filed one
day late, the applicant writes:
1. I thought the timing for appeal was based on the date
I received the information not the date of decision (from my Agent).
2. I only find out the fee structure has changed and I need to gather the
information to apply for a deduction of fees.
27 The applicant says she misunderstood that the time limit commenced from
the date of decision and not the date she received the
information. Ignorance of
the time limit itself is not an excuse regarded as a satisfactory explanation
SZSDA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
28 The applicant also suggests that her substantive application “was
delayed” because she needed to seek a reduction of
the Court fees. The
applicant has not provided any corroborating evidence that she would be unable
to pay the Court fees and, in
the absence of any further particulars, this is
arguably not a sufficient explanation for the delay in filing her application:
Plaintiff M90/2009 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
HCATrans 279.
29 While arguably “problematic”, the Court notes that the
applicant is unrepresented and, relevantly, that the Tribunal
waited four days
before sending its decision to the applicant. This clearly caused some
confusion for the applicant in determining
when she was required to file the
substantive application in this Court.
30 In the circumstances, the applicant’s reasons for the delay in
filing her substantive application are understandable.
31 This too weighs in favour of granting the extension of time.
32 There is a public interest in the finality of
litigation:
Maharjan v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection
[2017] FCAFC 23
. However, the Minister agrees that there will not
be any prejudice, per se, if the substantive application in this matter is
albeit one day late.
33 The Court agrees.
34 This weighs in favour of an extension of time being granted.
35 It is now well settled that the Court should not
grant an extension to pursue an application which has no arguable prospect of
success. To do so would be futile and would not be in the interests of the
administration of justice:
MZZIV v Minister for Immigration and Border
[2013] FCA 1203
36 When determining whether the proposed substantive application has
“merit”, the Court must do so at a reasonably impressionistic
MZABP v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection
[2015] FCA 1391.
Importantly, the applicant need only demonstrate that there is an
“arguable case” (which may not yet be fully developed)
Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error.
37 In this regard, the Court will itself remain astute and alert to whether
there is a reasonably arguable case:
MZAIB v Minister for Immigration &
Border Protection
[2015] FCA 1391.
The Tribunal’s Decision
38 In determining whether the substantive
application for judicial review has “merit”, it is useful to first
the Tribunal’s decision.
39 The Tribunal decision is five pages in length and spans 20 paragraphs. One
page consists of an extract of cl 187.233 of Schedule
2 to the Regulations.
40 The Tribunal began by identifying the visa under review (at [1]-[2]). It
then outlined the criteria for the grant of the visa and
the relevant visa
stream (at [3]-[4]).
41 The Tribunal then noted that the delegate had refused to grant the
applicant the visa because the applicant was not the subject
of an approved
nomination. That is, the nomination application made by the Trustee for Panpal
Unit Trust for the approval of the
nominated position of Café or
Restaurant manager was not approved (at [5]).
42 The Tribunal also noted that the applicant was represented by her
registered migration agent throughout the Tribunal proceeding
43 The Tribunal then identified that the issue before it was whether there
was “an approved nomination” (at [8]).
44 The Tribunal then summarised cl 187.233 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations
and detailed the criterion for the grant of the visa as
follows (at
Nomination of a position
9. Clause 187.233 as applicable in this case is set out
in full in an attachment to this decision. Essentially, it requires that
the position to which the application relates be the subject of an application
for approval of a nomination in the Direct Entry
stream, located in regional
Australia. The position must be the one that was the subject of the declaration
made as part of the current
visa application. In addition, where the associated
nomination was made on or after 1 July 2017, it must identify the applicant in
relation to the position.
10. In addition, this criterion also requires that:
the person who
will employ the applicant is the person who made nomination
the nomination
has been approved and has not been subsequently withdrawn
there is no
'adverse information' known to Immigration about the person who made the
nomination or a person 'associated with' that
person (within the meaning of reg
1.13A and reg 1.13B); or it is reasonable to disregard any such information
the position is
still available to the applicant, and
application was made no more than six months after the nomination of the
position was approved.
45 The Tribunal noted that on 19 February 2021, it had invited the applicant
(pursuant to s 359A of the Act) to provide comments in
writing on adverse
information – being a differently constituted Tribunal’s decision to
affirm the decision of a delegate
of the Minister to refuse the
nominator’s application (at [11]). As outlined by the Tribunal, the
invitation explained that
the information was relevant to the review because it
is a requirement for the visa that the applicant be the subject of an approved
nomination (at [11]). The invitation was sent to the applicant’s last
provided address and advised her that if a response was
not provided by 9 March
2021, the applicant might lose any entitlement to appear before the Tribunal (at
[12]). In that regard, the
Tribunal noted that the applicant had not provided a
response by 9 March 2021 and did not seek an extension of time within which
do so (at [13]). In the circumstances, the Tribunal determined that the
applicant was not entitled to appear before the Tribunal
and the Tribunal had no
power that would allow it to permit her to appear: the Act, ss 359C, 360(3) and
363A (at [13]).
46 In the circumstances, the Tribunal proceeded to make a decision without
taking further steps to obtain comments from the applicant
47 The Tribunal noted that the nominator’s nomination application had
been refused by the Department (at [15]). As the applicant’s
application
for the visa was related to that nomination application, the applicant did not
satisfy cl 187.233(3) of Schedule 2 to
the Regulations (at [15] and [16], citing
Singh v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection
[2017] FCAFC 105
48 The Tribunal noted that, because there was no approved nomination for the
applicant’s visa application and the nomination
was not (and could not
then be) approved, the applicant could not overcome this issue to satisfy cl
187.233 of the Regulations (at
49 The Tribunal concluded that cl 187.233(3) of the Regulations was not met
50 On the basis of the above, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s
decision not to grant the applicant the visa (at [20]).
Proposed Application for Judicial Review
51 In her proposed application for judicial review
filed on 16 April 2021, the applicant provides two “grounds of
as follows (without alteration):
1. I am appealing this decision based due to the
original decision that the delegate refused to grant the visa was incorrect.
2. I believe that under cl 187.233(3) of schedule 2 to the regulation that the
position of manager should have been approved and
did not meet guidelines.
52 Noting that the applicant was unrepresented, the Court explained to her
that the only issue before the Court was whether there
was “an arguable
case” that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error. In this regard,
the Court gave the applicant
the opportunity to explain orally what she thought
the Tribunal “did wrong”. This is the standard procedure in this
following the decision in
Bala v Minister for Immigration & Border
[2019] FCA 600
53 It was explained that the possible categories of jurisdictional error are
not exhaustive and sometimes overlap. Further, migration
decisions of this sort
most commonly include, but are not limited to, the following categories:
(a) where the decision-maker identifies the wrong issue
or asks the wrong question:
Craig v State of South Australia
(1995) 184 CLR 163
(b) where the decision-maker ignores relevant material:
(c) where the decision-maker relies on irrelevant material:
(d) where the decision-maker fails to follow mandatory procedures:
Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs &
(2005) HCA 24
(2005) 228 CLR 294
(e) where the decision-maker shows actual or apprehended bias:
Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Affairs & Citizenship
(f) where the decision is illogical, irrational or unreasonable:
Minister for
Immigration & Citizenship v SZMDS
(2010) 240 CLR 611
Minister for Immigration & Citizenship v Li
[2014] FCAFC 1
(2013) 249 CLR 332
Minister for Immigration & Border Protection v Singh
[2014] FCAFC 1
(2014) 231 FCR 437
54 It was also explained that this Court cannot review the merits of the
Tribunal’s decision when assessing whether there is
an arguable case that
the Tribunal made a material error in arriving at the decision it arrived at:
Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang
CLR 259 at 272.
55 Against this background, the applicant explained that, in effect, she had
two primary concerns. The first related to her view
that the Tribunal did not
properly assess the evidence before it in relation to the nominated position of
café manager. The
second was that her previous employer “no longer
existed” and she was now faced with a difficult (and clearly upsetting)
56 In relation to the applicant’s first concern, the Court explained to
the applicant that the Court could not assist her as
the Court had no power to
review the Tribunal’s decision in relation to the nomination. As counsel
for the Minister correctly
explained to the applicant, the applicant is, in
effect, saying that that the Tribunal should have approved the nomination under
reg 5.19 of the Regulations and the Court should find that the Tribunal erred by
not doing so. Unfortunately, that argument cannot
succeed because that decision
to refuse to approve the nomination was the subject of a
Tribunal decision (
The Trustee for Panpal Unit Trust (Migration)
and that decision is not subject to review by this Court in relation
to the current application. There is no application on foot
seeking judicial
review of the decision in
The Trustee for Panpal Unit Trust (Migration)
and, as such, there cannot be any collateral challenge to that decision in the
current proceedings: as per ss 479(a) and 486C(2)(a)
of the Act.
57 In relation to the applicant’s second concern, while the Court is,
of course, sympathetic, for the reasons that follow, the
concerns raised do not
address the issue of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.
Proposed Ground 1
58 The applicant’s first proposed ground
1. I am appealing this decision based due to the
original decision that the delegate refused to grant the visa was
59 In relation to ground 1, it is arguable that the applicant’s
concerns relate solely to a decision of the delegate. In this
regard, the Court
accepts the Minister’s position (as detailed at [26] in written
submissions dated 10 August 2021) that the
applicant has applied under s 476 of
the Act for judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision. Section 476(2) of
Act makes it
clear that this Court has no jurisdiction in relation to a primary
decision. The decision of the delegate on 8 June 2018 was a ‘primary
decision’ within the meaning of s 476(4)(a). As such, in considering the
current application for judicial review, the Court
has no power to make a ruling
on the delegate’s decision of 8 June 2018. The Court is limited to
considering whether there
was any error in the Tribunal’s decision dated
15 March 2021.
60 The applicant’s first proposed ground of review does not raise an
arguable case of jurisdictional error on the part of the
61 Ground 1 thus fails.
Proposed Ground 2
62 The applicant’s second proposed ground of
review states:
2. I believe that under cl 187.233(3) of schedule 2 to
the regulation that the position of Manager should have been approved and did
not meet guidelines.
63 Although not entirely clear, it is arguable that what the applicant is
arguing here is that the Tribunal “erred” –
in that it acted
“irrationally” or “illogically” – by not approving
the position of manager.
64 In relation to the Tribunal’s decision in
The Trustee for Panpal
Unit Trust (Migration)
[2020] AATA 4050
, the Court repeats what it said
above at [56] about what is and is not on review in this Court for the purposes
of the current application.
This Court cannot review the Tribunal’s
decision to refuse the nominator’s application for approval of the
position: the Act, s 479(a). The nominator’s decision is not
under review here. The nominator had the right to apply for review
Tribunal’s nomination decision but did not do so.
65 In relation to any concerns about illogicality the Court notes the
Minister’s written submissions as follows:
30. ... if the applicant is
asserting by this ground that the Tribunal erred in finding that cl 187.233(3)
was not satisfied, then
the ground cannot succeed because the Tribunal’s
finding and decision was a logical and rational decision open to it on the
evidence. It was, on the evidence before the Tribunal, the only decision
logically open to the Tribunal.
31. Clause 187.233(3) requires that the Minister has approved the nomination
for the position. It is a mandatory criterion. If the
Minister has not approved
the nomination the primary criteria for the visa will not be met and a decision
maker must not grant the
visa: see sub-s 65(1)(b) of the
Migration Act
32. The Tribunal found that the Minister had not approved the nomination by the
Trustee of the Panpal Unit Trust for the applicant’s
visa application [at
33. The Tribunal went onto decide that because the nomination had not been
approved the applicant could not meet the criteria of
cl 187.233. This was the
only conclusion open to the Tribunal on the facts before it. It was a logical,
rational and reasonable decision.
66 The Court agrees with the Minister in this regard.
67 As explained to the applicant at the hearing, the Tribunal was not
“reviewing” the nominator’s decision and the
nominator’s
decision is not relevant on review here. The Tribunal could not overturn the
nominator’s decision in light
of the information before it –
information that showed, unequivocally, that the sponsor’s nomination
application had
failed. Unfortunately, while the Court sympathises with the
applicant in relation to her concerns for her future, it cannot be said
that the Tribunal acted irrationally or illogically. The Tribunal took into
account all of the evidence that was necessary
for it to determine whether the
applicant met the relevant visa criteria. Unfortunately, once it was apparent
that the nominator’s
application had been denied, the Tribunal had no
choice but to affirm the delegate’s decision relating to the refusal of
applicant’s visa.
68 The Tribunal’s approach and conclusions were entirely open to it on
the evidence. Indeed, they were the only conclusions
open to it.
69 Ground 2, accordingly, fails
70 The applicant’s proposed grounds have no merit.
71 This weighs heavily against granting an extension of time.
72 The Court has also considered for itself whether any error arises in the
Tribunal’s decision. In that regard, it is noted
that the applicant has
not claimed that she was treated “unfairly” or that the Tribunal
adopted an approach to the determination
of the issues before it that
disadvantaged her. The Court accepts that to be the case. The applicant was
given ample opportunity
to present evidence that would strengthen her case. She
did not do so. No issues in relation to procedural fairness arise on the
of this case.
73 The Court has been unable to identify an arguable case of jurisdictional
error in the Tribunal’s decision or arising from
the materials before the
74 In any event, even if the Court did grant the extension of time and found
an error in the Tribunal’s decision, the applicant
would still be unable
to remedy the fact that she is not the subject of an approved nomination. On her
own evidence before this Court,
the nominator no longer exists and the Tribunal
would be bound to affirm the decision under review in any event. Clause
of Schedule 2 to the Regulations requires the applicant to be the
subject of an approved nomination relating to the position identified
visa application at the time of the decision. The application cannot be assessed
against a new nomination application subsequently
lodged by the employer:
at [88]-[90]. As the nominator’s nomination application was
refused by the delegate, the appeal of that decision to the Tribunal
unsuccessful and there is no evidence of a judicial review application being
filed, on remittal of the matter to the Tribunal,
the applicant could never
satisfy cl 187.233 of the Regulations. Remittal would thus be futile.
75 This weighs heavily against granting the extension of time.
76 In this matter the substantive application for
judicial review was filed only one day late. The explanation for that delay is,
contextually, sound and no prejudice would arise if the application were now
accepted. These factors all weigh in favour of the
Court granting the
applicant’s request for an extension of time in this matter. However, the
lack of an arguable case of jurisdictional
error on the part of the Tribunal
weighs significantly against granting an extension of time.
77 The applicant has failed to satisfy the Court that it is in the interests
of the administration of justice for an extension of
time to be granted.
78 Accordingly, the request for an extension of time is refused.
