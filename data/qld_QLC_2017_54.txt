APPEARANCES:
RE Laidely of Counsel, instructed by Websters Solicitors, for the applicant
in both matters
E Morzone of Counsel, instructed by Hede Byrne Hall, for the
respondent in both matters
[1] On 4 August 2017, I determined the amount of compensation
payable by Queensland Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd in relation to a mining
which will affect two rural properties. The Court has since received competing
applications for costs orders, with both the
landowners and QIM asserting they
are the successful party in these proceedings. This unusual circumstance arises
from arguments
to the hearing, and whether the respective offers are more or less
favourable to
each landowner than the amount determined by the Court.
[2] Before turning to
those arguments, it is appropriate to identify the legal principles which apply
to determining costs generally

Mineral Resources Act 1989
(MRA) provides the Court may order costs as it thinks
fit for proceedings such as these.
[4] Whether the Court is exercising the LCA power or, as in this case, the
power conferred by the MRA, its discretion to award costs
is unfettered. The
Court must judge each case on its own facts and circumstances. It must exercise
its discretion without caprice,
having regard to relevant considerations and
established
principles.
[5] Costs are not awarded to punish the unsuccessful party, but are intended
to be compensatory. They indemnify the successful party
against the expense to
which they have been put in the
litigation.

is a distinction between the LCA and MRA provisions in
one respect.
of the LCA provides that if the Court does not make an order for costs,
each party must bear their own. It is sometimes argued this

rule that each party bears their own costs unless the circumstances justify a
departure from that position. That
argument has been rejected by the Land Appeal

[11] Each of the offers made by the landowners were marked “without

put QIM, which was
legally represented, on notice that the principles relating to a Calderbank

were rejected. A Calderbank offer is a
without prejudice offer in which the offeror reserves the right to waive the

proceedings.
[12] Whether costs are
ordered on an indemnity basis is a matter of
discretion.
Generally two questions are posed. Was the offer a genuine attempt to compromise
the proceedings? Was it unreasonable for the offeree
Those questions will be addressed by
reference to the offers made by all parties.
The offers by the landowners
[13] The Court determined QIM must pay compensation to the
landowners prior to undertaking any activities authorised by ML80116. In
case of the Youngers, the amount determined was $2,008,700. In the case of Mrs
Ryan, the amount determined was
[14] The Youngers made 2 offers to settle. On 17 May 2016, they offered to
settle for $1,700,000. On 28 October 2017, they offered
to settle for
$1,500,000. Mrs Ryan made one offer to settle, on 31 October 2016, for $200,000.
[15] Each of the landholders’ offers sought costs as agreed or
assessed on the standard basis and interest at the Land Court
rate from the date
of the order until payment of compensation and costs. QIM did not accept any of
those offers.
[16] The Youngers seek an order for costs on the standard basis
to 1 June 2016 (the date the first offer expired) and then on an indemnity
basis. Mrs Ryan seeks an order for costs on the standard basis to 22 November
2016 (when her offer expired) and then on an indemnity
[17] The Court
must consider whether a particular offer was a genuine attempt to reach a
negotiated settlement and not just a means
of triggering a costs
I am satisfied each of the landowner’s offers were genuine attempts to
compromise the proceedings.
[18] In each case, the offers were more
favourable than the determination of compensation, an indication that they were
contemptuous.
their second offer, the Youngers reduced the amount they were prepared to settle
for, another indication of their desire to settle
the proceedings.
the outcome is more favourable to the offeror than their offer was, it is
generally accepted that a persuasive burden rests
on the offeree to demonstrate
its failure to accept the offer was “objectively
reasonable”.
key question is whether “the rejection of the offer was unreasonable in
circumstances”.
Relevant factors include:
(a) Whether there was sufficient time to consider the
(b) Whether the offeree had adequate information to enable it to
consider the offer; and
(c) Whether any conditions are attached and if so,
whether those conditions are
reasonable.
[21] Taking those factors into account, it was unreasonable for
QIM to reject the offers. All the landowners’ offers were made
advance of the hearing. The first offer by the Youngers was made more than six
months before the hearing. The second offer
by the Youngers and Mrs Ryan’s
offer were both made more than a month before the hearing commenced. For all
offers, QIM was
given adequate time to consider
was also in a position to properly consider the offers. They were made when most
of the expert evidence, compensation and
hearing statements had been filed. The
evidence filed subsequently did not materially alter the substance of the
a number of live issues between experts at that stage, however QIM was in a
position to consider the relative strengths
of its case and of the
landowners’. Further, although QIM had some success on a number of those
issues, the amounts proposed
by the Youngers was significantly less than the
amount ultimately awarded.
[23] The conditions attached to the
landowners’ offers are frequently encountered in settlement offers and
related to costs
and interest. They were not unusual or excessive and gave
certainty about the amount sought by way of compensation.
QIM’s offer
[24] Shortly before the hearing, which commenced on 12 December
2016, QIM made offers to settle to both the Youngers and Mrs Ryan.
were emailed to counsel for the landowners on 9 December; the Friday before the
hearing. It was formally made to their
solicitor on the morning of Monday 12
December; the first day of the hearing. The landholders did not accept the
[25] There is a dispute about how QIM’s offers should be
quantified. The offers provided for monetary compensation: to the Youngers,
sum of $1,500,000; and to Mrs Ryan, the sum of $200,000. That compensation was
payable by instalments over five years with interest
to accrue from the date of
grant of the mining lease. QIM also offered to pay costs as agreed or assessed,
although the costs were
not subject to interest.
[26] The offers included
proposed terms and conditions in the nature of undertakings by QIM about how,
when, and where mining would
occur and what arrangements would be put in place
to allow the landowners to access and use parts of their property not being

obvious difficulty with QIM’s submission is that the time for the offeree
to evaluate an offer is when it is
The findings on which QIM quantifies its offers were not known to the
landowners, or indeed to QIM, when the offers were made. QIM
did not attempt to
calculate their value at the time.
[31] The conceptual difference of the

offers involved payments by instalments over a five year period. That was less
favourable to the landowners than the determination
of a single payment prior to
mining commencing.
[32] Even if it was accepted that the offers qualified as
a genuine attempt to compromise the proceedings, it was reasonable for the
landowners to reject it for a number of reasons.
[33] Firstly, the offers
were made the Friday before the hearing and only formally put to the landowners
on the morning it was due
to commence. By that time the landowners had already
completed all their preparation for the hearing, which was about to commence.
The landowners were not given adequate time to consider the

for each of them. In the Youngers’ case,
I award costs on the standard

than the first, as the date indemnity costs

a significant amount of evidence after the first offer. Although that did not

award costs on the standard basis until her offer expired and then on an

[37] I make the following orders:
1. Queensland Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd must pay James
Younger, Fay Dorelle Younger and Christopher Younger’s costs assessed

2. Queensland Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd must pay Edith Elizabeth
Ryan’s costs assessed on the standard basis until 22 November
then on an indemnity basis.
