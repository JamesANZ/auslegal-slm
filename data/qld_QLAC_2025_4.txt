APPEARANCES:
RJ Anderson KC with WDJ Macintosh (instructed by HWL Ebsworth) for the
DR Gore KC with DA Quayle (instructed by Moreton Bay Regional Council)
for the respondent
August, this Court allowed an appeal on a preliminary question posed by Genamson
Holdings Pty Ltd about its entitlements
under discontinued notices to
appeal, Genamson submitted that
Acquisition of Land Act
(Qld) entitled it to claim disturbance costs similar to that available
The Council submitted that Genamson’s entitlements were
limited to legal costs and expenses.
[3] This Court
held that Genamson was not entitled to disturbance costs but might be entitled
to something more than legal costs and
expenses. The appeal was allowed.
[4] Genamson now
seeks its costs of that appeal and also the hearing below.
[5] Pursuant to
Land Court Act
(Qld) this Court has an unfettered
discretion to award costs.
that costs follow the event may inform the exercise of the
discretion.
[6] Genamson
submits that the application of this principle, alone, justifies an order for
costs in its favour.
[7] The Council
submits that the Court should have regard not only to the appeal being allowed,
but also the reasons for judgment
and the terms on which the case has been
remitted to the Land Court for further determination. By examining the decision
way, the Council submits that its success was greater than that enjoyed
by Genamson.
[8] The Council
further submits that analysis does not offend the principle that a Court should
be cautious about undertaking an issue
by issue analysis of a case unless there
is a particular issue or group of issues that is clearly dominant or separable
[9] Although
Genamson was technically successful on appeal in that the original decision was
overturned, each party enjoyed a measure
of success. The outcome could be
characterised as having been
contestable.
[10] The mixed
success of each party is a compelling reason for concluding that the discretion
as to costs ought to be exercised on
the basis that neither party be ordered to
pay the costs of the other.
[11] No order as
