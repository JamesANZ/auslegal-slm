REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered on 17 April 2024)
[1] After a
trial, a jury found the applicant guilty of one count of sexual intercourse
without consent contrary to s 192(3) of the
Criminal Code 1983
The circumstances of the offending
circumstances of the offending were that the applicant, who was 50 years old,
and the victim, who was 31, had been friends
for about a year. The applicant and
his partner had a party at their home and the victim attended. She became
significantly intoxicated,
to the point where she needed help walking. The
applicant and another person helped the victim to the spare room and put her to
where she fell asleep. Some hours later, the applicant went into the spare
bedroom. He inserted at least one finger into the victim’s
digitally penetrating her vagina whilst stimulating her clitoris with his thumb.
This lasted for at least some minutes. The
victim thought she was being
stimulated by her boyfriend and became aroused. When she woke up and saw the
applicant, she was shocked
and left. The applicant knew the victim was asleep
and therefore could not and did not consent. The victim suffered Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder as a consequence of the offending, requiring medication and
counselling. The offending detrimentally affected the
victim’s sexual
relations with her long-term partner.
The sentence
[3] As he was
convicted at trial, the applicant was not entitled to any discount on the
sentence for a plea of guilty and remorse.
As to remorse, the sentencing Judge
found that, during an interview with Police, the applicant had attempted to
shift blame towards
an innocent man. In addition, he gave evidence at the trial
denying that the offending occurred, and also told Police and gave evidence
that, if there was any touching of the victim by him, this occurred when he
tried to reposition the victim from an uncomfortable
position on the bed. The
jury clearly rejected the applicant’s account. The sentencing Judge found
the applicant had no remorse
for the offending.
applicant had no relevant criminal history and, as the sentencing Judge
observed, was sentenced on the basis that he was a
first offender, he was a
willing and hard-working employee, he had excellent work and personal references
and this conduct was out
of character for him.
applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and eight months, with a
non-parole period of four years. At the time,
the mandatory minimum non-parole
period for this offence was 70% of the head sentence, and the non-parole period
was fixed in the
minimum term.
The proposed grounds of
applicant has now made an application for an extension of time within which to
apply for leave to appeal, together with an
application for leave to appeal. The
proposed grounds of appeal are: (1) the sentencing Judge erred in crafting a
sentence on the
basis of the observations made in the decision of the Court of
Criminal Appeal in
The Queen v Nabegeyo
(2014) 34 NTLR 154
; and (2) in
all the circumstances the sentence imposed was manifestly
Misapplication of authority
[7] In relation
to proposed appeal ground 1, we consider there was no error in the sentencing
Judge’s reference to and reliance
The Queen v Nabegeyo
[8] That was a
decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in a Crown appeal against sentence on
the basis of manifest inadequacy, resulting
in the offender being re-sentenced.
Such appeals are for the purpose of laying down principles for the governance
and guidance of
courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons (see
Green v The Queen
[2011] HCA 49
(2011) 244 CLR 462
was expressly about the standards of punishment for the offence of sexual
intercourse without consent in cases involving highly
intoxicated and/or
sleeping victims who are extremely vulnerable to sexual assault (see [2]).
propriety of taking the decision in
into account is confirmed by
the reference to it as a relevant decision by the applicant’s counsel in
their submissions on
sentencing Judge’s reference to and reliance on
properly, as a useful yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence to
be imposed on the applicant (see
Barbaro v The Queen
[2014] HCA 2
(2014) 253 CLR 58
[11] Contrary to
the applicant’s submissions, the sentencing Judge did not
‘craft’ the applicant’s sentence
around the decision in
in an improper way. His Honour took into account the objective
and subjective factors relevant to the sentencing exercise of the
applicant’s individual case, expressly noting that ‘every case of
sexual intercourse without consent must be assessed
on its own facts’. No
specific error is apparent from the sentencing Judge’s reference to
, and the applicant’s submission in this respect resolves to
an assertion that
involved more serious offending and provides
support for the conclusion that the sentence imposed in this case was manifestly
[12] Proposed
ground 1 has no merit.
Manifest excess
[13] In relation
to proposed ground 2, the sentence of five years and eight months is not
manifestly excessive. It is not so far outside
the range of a reasonable
discretionary judgment as to itself bespeak error. Two particular matters must
be noted in that respect.
[14] First, the
head sentence of five years and eight months would have been reduced to four
years and three months had the applicant
pleaded guilty and taken the benefit of
the discount ordinarily applied in those circumstances. That term after the
notional discount
cannot be characterised as manifestly excessive having regard
to the established sentencing standards for this category of offence.
[15] Secondly,
the fact that the penetration in this case was digital-vaginal rather than a
penile-vaginal does not necessarily demand
a lower sentence. There is the one
maximum penalty for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. It should
not be supposed
that for the purposes of punishment one means of penetration is
more heinous than another (see
Ibbs v The Queen
[1987] HCA 46
(1987) 163 CLR 447
452). Although offences of digital penetration will often be less serious than
penile-vaginal intercourse without consent, that
will depend on the
circumstances (see
BM v The Queen
[2023] NSWCCA 68
relevant considerations will remain the nature and degree of the invasion of the
victim’s bodily integrity, any breach
of trust involved and the impact on
the victim.
[16] We do not
accept the applicant’s submission that the sentencing range for offences
of sexual intercourse without consent
involving digital penetration, in which
breach of trust and significant adverse psychological consequences for the
victim are aggravating
features, is imprisonment of between two and a half to
four years (as put in writing) or five years (as put orally at the hearing).
That range was put on the basis of sentences imposed in nine other cases.
[17] We do not
accept that those cases provide a proper foundation for the determination of
such a range, because:
(a) six of the nine cases are from 2003 to 2012, meaning they are not
contemporary, when it is well recognised that courts now have
understanding of the long-term harm done to the victims of sexual offending than
they had in the past (see
The Queen v Kilic
[2016] HCA 48
(2016) 259 CLR 256
(b) two of the nine cases involved offences for which the maximum penalty
operating at the time was imprisonment for seven years,
whereas the maximum
penalty for the applicant’s offence is life imprisonment; and
(c) cases involving the offence of sexual intercourse without consent against
adults are particularly fact-sensitive, making the
identification of a specific
range or standard difficult (see
Forrest v The Queen
[2017] NTCCA 5
[18] Even if it
were to be accepted that the applicant’s sentence is markedly different
from other sentences imposed in other
cases (which is not our view), we are not
satisfied that the difference is such that there must have been some
misapplication of
principle. We are of the view that, when the sentencing
remarks are read as a whole, the sentencing Judge properly took into account
both the objective circumstances and seriousness of the offence and all relevant
subjective circumstances of the applicant, including
his prospects of
rehabilitation and that he is a person unlikely to reoffend.
[19] Proposed
ground 2 has no merit.
