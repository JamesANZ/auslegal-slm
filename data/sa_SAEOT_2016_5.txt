STOKES (No 2)
THE TRIBUNAL DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING JUDGMENT:
Mrs Ragless’
complaint against Mr Stokes under the
Equal Opportunity Act 1984
(“the Act”) of victimisation and unlawful discrimination was
referred to this Tribunal, heard and dismissed.
application for costs was then made on behalf of Mr Stokes against both
Mrs Ragless and her husband, Mr Ragless, who was not a
party to the
proceedings before the Tribunal.
Power to award costs
Act provides, in s 26(1):-
Tribunal may make an order for costs in proceedings in accordance with the scale
prescribed for that purpose—
(a) if in the
opinion of the Tribunal the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or
(b) if in the
opinion of the Tribunal the proceedings have been instituted or prosecuted for
the purpose of delay or obstruction;
(c) if in the
opinion of the Tribunal there are other good reasons for doing
Mrs Ragless
application for costs against Mrs Ragless was made on the basis that the
proceedings were frivolous or vexatious within the meaning
of s 26(1)(a),
or that there were other reasons for making an award of costs, pursuant to
s 26(1)(c).
Frivolous or vexatious
counsel for the respondent, argued that Mrs Ragless’ proceedings
before the Tribunal were frivolous or vexatious.
The meaning of the phrase
“frivolous or vexatious” was discussed in
King v SA Psychological
The next question which has to be determined is whether,
in the circumstances of the allegations as I have described them and of the
withdrawal, the Tribunal was justified in reaching the opinion that proceedings
were frivolous or vexatious. As Toohey J pointed
Jones v Cusack
[1992] HCA 40
(1992) 109 ALR 313
at 315-316, the question is whether the proceedings
themselves were vexatious and not whether they have been instituted vexatiously.
It is not the appellant’s belief in the correctness of his arguments with
which the Court is concerned. Proceedings will be
frivolous or vexatious if the
litigation can be seen to be futile and destined to lead only to expense and
inconvenience for the
parties where there is no possibility of the action
proceeding...
Mr Ragless,
on behalf of Mrs Ragless, argued in effect that in complaining to the
Commissioner, and pursuing the matter in the Tribunal,
Mrs Ragless’
motivation had not been frivolous or vexatious. It is clear from the
authorities cited above that it is the substance
and merits of the proceedings
which are relevant to an assessment of whether the proceedings are frivolous or
vexatious, rather than
the motivation of the complainant.
proceedings in the Tribunal in this matter were dismissed on the basis that they
had no prospect of success. Detailed reasons
for that determination were
For the same reasons, I
determine that the proceedings were frivolous or vexatious within the meaning of
s 26(1)(a) of the Act.
is not necessary for me to undertake any consideration of
Mrs Ragless’ motivation at any stage of the process, and I will
Other good reasons
do not consider that any basis for an award of costs has been established under
s 26(1)(c) of the Act.
is within the discretion of the Tribunal as to whether costs should be awarded,
even after a determination that the proceedings
were frivolous and
deciding how to exercise that discretion, I have had regard to the general
purpose of the Act in so far as it can be gleaned from
the provisions of the Act
and the long title of the Act which says that it is:-
An Act to promote equality of opportunity between the
citizens of this State; to prevent certain kinds of discrimination based on
race, disability, age or various other grounds; to facilitate the participation
of citizens in the economic and social life
of the community; and to deal with
other related matters.
purpose of the Act in providing for an award of costs where proceedings are
frivolous or vexatious is to give a small measure
of protection against claims
which have no prospect of success, having regard to the cost and inconvenience
of defending a complaint.
considerations must be weighed with the evident policy behind creating a
generally cost-order free jurisdiction, which is to
encourage the making of
complaints under the Act, or at least encouraging in the making of complaints
with some prospect of success.
this matter, Mrs Ragless’ attention was drawn repeatedly to the
defects in her complaint. Those defects were set out in
the respondent’s
Answer and in the respondent’s counsel’s outline of submissions with
respect to the application
to dismiss the proceedings.
these considerations, in all of the circumstances of this matter, I consider
that the respondent is entitled to an order
that the complainant pay his costs
of this matter on a party/party basis.
Mr Ragless,
in his oral submissions, said that an award of costs would ‘punish’
Mrs Ragless. I make it clear that there
is no sense in which the award of
costs is intended to constitute punishment. It simply recognises the costs and
the inconvenience
which a respondent experiences where a complaint which cannot
succeed under the Act is pursued against him or her.
respondent applied for an order for costs against Mr Ragless,
notwithstanding the fact that he was not a party to the proceedings.
argued that, on the wording of s 26(1) of the Act, there was no basis upon
which to limit the power to award costs to an
award against a

that such orders are exceptional;
that there must be a connection or association between the party to the
litigation and the non-party against whom the order

makes it just to make the order; and
that it is not necessary to demonstrate any improper conduct, but if there is
improper conduct it will plainly be a relevant

, and by the Full Court of the Federal
Dunghutti Elders Council (Aboriginal Corporation) RNTBC v Registrar
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations (No 4)
[2012] FCAFC
, with the Full Court going on to hold:
The Court has power to make an order for costs against a non-party where the
non-party is connected with the unsuccessful party to
the proceeding, and has
caused that party to start, continue or prosecute the proceeding in
circumstances where the non-party’s
conduct makes it just and equitable
that the non-party be visited with an order for costs in favour of the
successful party either
in addition to such an order against the unsuccessful
party or in substitution for such an order.
pointed out that Mrs Ragless’ complaint arose out of the same
circumstances which have given rise to numerous actions
commenced by
Mr Ragless, in this jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions.
Ms Walker also pointed out that some of the documents
Mrs Ragless were clearly drafted by Mr Ragless, and that Mr Ragless
clearly had considerable involvement in the conduct
of the proceedings.
accept that Mr Ragless has had significant involvement in this matter.
However, I do not consider that an order for costs against
him would be
appropriate. The substance and merits of the complaint dealt largely with
Mrs Ragless’ involvement in the situation,
and its impact upon her.
Mrs Ragless argued the application to dismiss on her own behalf. This is
not an appropriate case for an
award of costs against a non-party, even if the
Tribunal has such a power.
