Reasons For Decision
1. The six applicants herein commenced proceedings on 6 September
2005 by lodging in the Registry of the Court applications for recovery
seeking orders against the respondent. The claims brought were said to rely
upon entitlements for wages and other benefits
pursuant to the
Assistants (State) Award
and pursuant to the
Annual Holidays Act
Long Service Leave Act
. It would appear from the papers that the
six applicants have all been employees of the respondent in the
respondent’s pharmacy
business and that the respondent’s control
over the business had ended when a Receiver had been appointed to the business.
Thereafter the applicants had brought claims against the respondent personally
in relation to alleged unpaid wages, annual leave
entitlements and long service
leave entitlements.
2. The proceedings have had a somewhat unusual
history. Following two mentions in the Deputy Registrar’s call over list
claims were set down for hearing on 6 February 2006. However, the
parties were granted an adjournment of the hearing by consent
in circumstances
where the Court was informed that settlement negotiations were well advanced and
appeared likely to lead to a resolution
of the matter without litigation.
Thereafter the matter was mentioned on a number of occasions usually by a Sydney
agent of the
respondent’s solicitors. In due course the Court was
informed that the substantive claims brought by the six applicants had
settled. Following negotiations which had continued for some months all
outstanding issues between the parties had been
resolved with a single exception
being the question of costs. The Court was informed that the parties had
endeavoured to resolve
the question of costs through negotiations, but the
negotiations had not been successful.
3. The Court was informed that the
general position of the Respondent was that he was content to pay the reasonable
professional costs
incurred by the applicants in pursuing their claims.
However, the amounts claimed on behalf of the applicants concerning costs
appeared to the respondent to be excessive and in those circumstances the
assistance of the Court was sought to determine the question
4. The matter was listed for hearing on 19 April 2006. Again,
the respondent was represented by a Sydney agent for the respondent’s
solicitor and there was no appearance for the applicants. The Court was
informed that the parties were content for the question
of costs to be
determined by the Court on the papers. Written submissions had been lodged in
the Registry by Macquarie Law Solicitors
acting for the respondent, whilst
submissions prepared by Mr Dorber had also been lodged representing the claims
made on behalf of
the applicants.
5. As I understand the claims made for
costs on behalf of the six applicants, the position is that the solicitor acting
for five of
the six applicants seeks no professional costs in respect of the
legal work carried out by the firm in question, namely M. J. Duffy
solicitors. It would appear that all six applicants approached that firm of
solicitors and sought legal advice in relation
to their claims against the
respondent herein. At that time the solicitors had formed the view that the
claims involved an area
of law which was outside the firm’s usual area of
practice. Consequently, the firm involved the business operated by Mr Colin
Dorber, who is an industrial advocate, to advise and assist the six applicants.
It is not entirely clear whether any relationship
was established between M J
Duffy & Son Solicitors and Mr Dorber’s business. For example, it is
unclear whether M J Duffy
& Son Solicitors believed that they were retaining
Mr Dorber in a fashion similar to a firm of solicitors briefing a barrister
act on behalf of the solicitor’s clients, or whether M J Duffy & Son
Solicitors believed that they were referring their
clients to Mr Dorber who
would thereafter act for them in a fashion similar to a solicitor referring
clients to another firm of solicitors
offering a different legal
6. Whatever the belief was on the part of M J Duffy & Son
Solicitors it is clear that Mr Colin Dorber was of the view that the
applicants had been referred to him and that he was not being retained by M J
Duffy & Son Solicitors but was, rather, entering
into a direct relationship
with the six applicants who were each required to execute a costs agreement with
7. It would appear that, at least by the time the matter came
before the Court as presently constituted for the question of costs
determined five of the six applicants were of the view that they were
represented by M J Duffy & Son whilst the second
applicant herein, Ms
Pearce, had apparently severed her relationship with that firm of solicitors and
regarded herself as being represented
in the proceedings by Mr
8. As I understand the submissions that have been filed, M J
Duffy & Son Solicitors make no claim in respect of professional costs
work performed by that firm. However, the five applicants represented by that
firm each entered into agreements to pay monies
to Mr Dorber’s company and
M J Duffy & Son Solicitors adopts the stance of supporting the proposition
that the respondent
is liable to meet the amounts payable to Mr Dorber and his
company, Employment Advocacy Solutions Pty Ltd.
9. Whilst Mr Dorber
apparently represents Ms Pearce at this stage of the proceedings the claim he
makes for payment relates to all
six applicants.
10. The submissions
filed on behalf of the respondent include as an annexure a copy of
correspondence from Macquarie Law on behalf
of the respondents to Mr Dorber
dated 2 February 2006. The letter includes at paragraph 3 the following
“Does an employee advocate stand in the same position as
a legal practitioner, in relation to costs, in this
11. The material before the Court which has been
provided by the parties as annexures to written submissions fails to disclose
response by Mr Dorber to that specific question.
12. The written
submissions forwarded by Macquarie Law to the Registrar of this Court on 10
April 2006 include precisely the same
question. The Court notes that the
respondent’s solicitor has made no specific submission in relation to this
question, but
has instead posed a question to Mr Dorber and to the
13. In the view of the Court the respondent is entitled to an
answer to such a question. It is also appropriate for the six applicants
have that issue determined. Mr Dorber has stated in correspondence that he
presses for payment for services provided to the
six applicants and “
the fee is not paid I will be compelled to commence recovery proceedings for the
full amount.”
14. In his written submissions Mr Dorber states
“Work done is only work of a kind understood to be permitted in
relation to acting as agent in industrial relations, workers’
compensation
and recovery of wages matters.”
He also states
Ltd does not and has never held itself out to be a provider of legal advice,
operated in any way as a law firm, or
engaged in activities covered by the Legal
Services Act not permitted to be done by non lawyers.”
He goes on,
“Clients are always told we are not a law firm.”
the written submissions Mr Dorber states,
“We cross refer to those
firms or clients whose work becomes, or requires, formal legal
intervention.”
15. In relation to these proceedings Mr
Dorber states
“Each client was informed that if Mr Magner did not pay
the costs, an application would be made to the Court.”
as presently constituted, is aware that over a period of years a practice has
developed whereby industrial advocates
who are not by law permitted to perform
the work of solicitors and barristers have been appearing in this jurisdiction.
they seek leave to appear and inform the Court that they are not
legally qualified but on many other occasions no such leave is sought.
would appear that a belief has grown that unqualified persons are entitled to
appear as of right in this jurisdiction.
16. It is clear that there are
distinct categories of unqualified persons who are entitled to appear as of
right. An industrial
organisation of employees or an industrial organisation
of employers may send to the Court as an advocate an industrial officer or
person to appear for the organisation even though they are not a solicitor or
barrister. Further, where a corporation is
a party to proceedings the company
may elect not to engage a solicitor or a barrister but to instead be represented
by a director
or manager authorised to represent the company even though they
are not a solicitor or barrister.
17. The question in this case is
whether an industrial advocate has the right to appear in this jurisdiction,
whether the Court has
so, whether any power exists to award costs of a quasi legal nature to
industrial advocates.
18. It is understandable how such confusion and
uncertainty could have arisen. As indicated above, it is not uncommon for
officers from unions and employer organisations to appear as of right
both in this Court and before the Industrial Relations Commission
Session. Further, there appears to be a degree of general confusion concerning
the nature of the jurisdiction of the Industrial
Relations Commission of New
South Wales. It is clear that when the Commission sits as the Industrial
Relations Commission in Court
Session it is in every sense a Court of law. In
fact it is a superior court of record and its judicial officers are entitled to
the seniority and status of Supreme Court Judges. When the Commission
exercises its jurisdiction as the Commission in Court Session
it is clearly
performing a judicial function.
19. However, the Industrial Relations
Commission also includes conciliation commissioners who do not perform a
judicial function but
instead carry out conciliation and arbitral functions.
These are not judicial functions. Whilst only the judicial officers of
Commission can perform the judicial functions of that body, the judicial
officers also exercise the conciliation and arbitral
functions of the
Commission. It appears to the Court that in circumstances where the Chief
Industrial Magistrate’s jurisdiction
is common with some of the judicial
functions of the Industrial Relations Commission in Court Session it has been
assumed by some
industrial advocates that a right of appearance before a
Conciliation Commissioner in the Industrial Relations Commission is in some
mirrored in the Chief Industrial Magistrate’s Court.
20. In this
context I note the submissions of Mr Dorber where he states “
is only work of a kind understood to be permitted in relation to acting as agent
in industrial relations, workers compensation
and recovery of wage
Whilst I am not aware of the manner in which recovery of
wage matters are dealt with in the State of Queensland where Mr Dorber
apparently based it is clear that in the State of New South Wales recovery of
wage matters cannot be determined by a Conciliation
Commissioner but can be
heard in the Chief Industrial Magistrate’s Court or, where appropriate, by
a judge in the Industrial
Relations Commission in Court Session.
is clearly appropriate for all concerned that these matters are clarified. In
this case, the six applicants agreed to be
represented by Mr Dorber in
circumstances where they were led to believe that at the conclusion of the
matter, if they were successful,
the Court would have jurisdiction to award
costs in their favour. It would appear that Mr Dorber understood that to be
It would also appear that their solicitor, at M J Duffy & Son
Solicitors believed that this would be the case. Presumably,
in that regard,
they relied on the advice of Mr Dorber. Earlier this year I handed down a
decision in the matter of
Margaret Noble v Digital Hearing Centres.
that matter the Court discovered during the running of the matter that both the
applicant and the respondent were represented
by industrial advocates who were
not entitled to practice as solicitors or barristers. After dealing with the
merits of the claim,
I indicated that before any order was made in relation to
costs I would need to be satisfied that the Court had the requisite jurisdiction
to make an order in relation to costs other than costs for the provision of
legal services. It is clear that legal services can
only be provided by
persons who are entitled to practice as solicitors and barristers and to provide
such legal services.
22. One of the parties in that matter has indicated that
they wish to present submissions in support of the proposition that the Court
does have that jurisdiction. The Court is presently awaiting the presentation
of such written submissions and when they are to
hand it is proposed that other
interested parties will be invited to make submissions to the Court. These
other parties will include
the Law Society of New South Wales, the New South
Wales Bar Association and the Industrial Registrar for New South Wales
representing
the President of the Industrial Relations Commission of New South
23. It is unfortunate for the parties in this matter that their
dispute in relation to costs arises at a time when the Court is in
the process
of giving consideration to such fundamental jurisdictional issues.
is clear that Mr Dorber has spent considerable time in endeavouring to assist
the six applicants. It is also clear that he
has incurred substantial out of
pocket expenses relating to travel and accommodation whilst providing such
assistance. Mr Dorber
clearly has much at stake in relation to the manner in
which this matter is determined. In those circumstances I do not propose
resolve the costs issue in this matter until such time as the fundamental
question is dealt with in
Margaret Noble v Digital Hearing Centres.
propose to stand this matter over for further mention on Wednesday 11 October
2006. In the meantime I propose to direct that
the parties in this matter,
including Mr Dorber, are notified of any hearing in the matter of
Noble v Digital Hearing Centres
so that they have the opportunity to
participate as intervenors should they so wish. In any event, even if the
parties herein do
not wish to intervene in the other matter it is clearly
appropriate that they are informed of the outcome of the other proceedings
will direct that such notification be provided.
25. The matter is
adjourned to 11 October 2006. In the meantime the parties shall have liberty
to apply to the Court on 7 days notice.
