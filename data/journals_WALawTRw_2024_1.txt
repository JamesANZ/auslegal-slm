EDITORS’ FOREWORD
We are thrilled to introduce you to this second volume of WALTR — the
Western Australian Law Teachers’ Review.
Since the successful
publication of the first volume in February 2023, we have made some exciting
changes to WALTR.
In particular, we have introduced a more formalised process for
double-anonymous peer review of articles. We extend our thanks to
all who made
this volume possible by voluntarily reviewing submissions.
In addition to longer-form scholarly articles, WALTR now has a new
contribution category — 'teaching notes'. Teaching notes
provide authors
with opportunities to publish writing which is not suitable as a scholarly
article, but is nonetheless of interest
to other law teachers. A wide variety of
writing may fall into this category, including short reflections on teaching and
experiences, contextualised lesson plans for other law teachers
(including those teaching political and legal studies in secondary
schools), and
opinion pieces relating to teaching and learning in law.
We have also assembled an Editorial Advisory Committee comprising local,
national and international law academics, as well as current
and former Western
Australian judges and tribunal members. The Committee will commence in their
advisory roles in August 2024.
WALTR continues to publish valuable, engaging articles on topics relating to
legal education. Ultimately seven pieces from eleven
authors are published in
this second volume. We thank everybody who has contributed to this volume for
its successful publication.
