Member: S R Carey
INTRODUCTION
1 The applicant asserts that on 12 December 2013 he was injured
in a motor vehicle accident in the vicinity of the Foreshore Tavern
Lauderdale. The applicant made a claim for scheduled benefits in relation to
his injury and such claim was rejected by the Motor
Accidents Insurance Board
(“the Board”) on the basis that a report to police had not been made
as required by s23(2A)
of the Motor Accidents (Liabilities & Compensation)
Act 1973. The applicant then made a referral to the Tribunal for a review
that determination on the basis that he asserts that he did in fact make a
report to police or in the alternative that the circumstances
at the time were
such that the applicant ought to be excused for his failure to give such
DETERMINATION
2 The reference to the Tribunal was received on 21 February
2014. Since then the reference has been the subject of a number of directions
hearing either by phone or in person with solicitors representing each party.
The parties were both in possession of statements
made by the attending police
officers to the effect that they attended the scene of a supposed motor vehicle
accident on 12 December
2013, however upon arrival there was a denial by those
persons present that there had been a motor vehicle accident. It was stated
the police officers that the applicant had in fact injured himself when he had
fallen over and cut his leg. In response to this,
the Tribunal was advised on
behalf of the applicant that there would be alternate evidence provided on
behalf of the applicant disputing
this version of events contained in the
statements made by the attending police officers. No such alternate evidence
has been adduced.
There have now been a number of teleconferences, or
directions hearing before the Tribunal during which the solicitor for the
has sought further time to obtain instructions in order to advance the
applicant’s case or has sought time in which to contact
the applicant.
The last such directions hearing was on 1 July 2014 when the solicitor for the
applicant advised that she was not
in a position to advance the
applicant’s case as she had been unable to contact her client either by
mail or by telephone.
She, however, sought further time to ensure that her
client was served with correspondence from her seeking instructions and also
detailing the likely consequences should those instructions not be provided. At
a hearing on 24 July 2014 the solicitor for the
applicant advised that personal
service had occurred of correspondence from her to her client seeking urgent
instructions and also
advising as to the consequences should those instructions
or contact with her not occur before Friday, 18 July 2014. At the hearing
July 2014 the solicitor for the applicant advised that she had received no
to advance matters on
behalf of the applicant as she considered herself without
instructions.
3 Upon confirmation of these matters, the solicitor for the
Board sought to have the referral dismissed with an order that the applicant
the respondent’s costs.
4 In support of that applicant it was submitted
that there had been little done by the applicant to prosecute his case since it
made to the Tribunal. In summary, it was submitted that:
• The applicant has failed to give instructions to his
lawyer in order to advance this referral;
• No explanation has been
provided to the Tribunal as to why those instructions could not be
• There has been a period of 5 months during which the
applicant has failed to prosecute this reference to any significant
• That the respondent is and has for some time been in a
position to proceed to hearing on this reference; and
• There will be
an unnecessary loss of time and resource for the Tribunal and also a prejudice
in costs to the respondent should
this matter now be prepared and listed for
hearing at which the applicant fails to attend.
5 The Tribunal was satisfied given the length of delay since
this reference was made to the Tribunal, the lack of any significant
the applicant to prosecute the reference, the lack of any explanation as to his
failure to prosecute the reference and
the likely prejudice to the respondent in
allowing this reference to proceed that it is an appropriate exercise of the
discretion to dismiss this reference.
6 Additionally, given
the circumstances set out above, the Tribunal also orders that the applicant
bear the respondent’s costs
of and incidental to this reference.
