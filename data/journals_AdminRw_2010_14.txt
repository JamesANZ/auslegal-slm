The Australian Government is reforming the
Freedom of Information Act
with the principal objective of promoting a culture of disclosure
throughout government. The reforms are being implemented in two
stages. In the
first stage the Government introduced legislation to repeal the power to issue
conclusive certificates under the FOI
Act and the
Archives Act 1983
Freedom of Information (Removal of Conclusive Certificates and Other
Measures) Act 2009
came into force on 7 October 2009. In his second
reading speech on the Bill, the Cabinet Secretary advised the
Parliament:
The measures in this Bill deliver on the Government’s election commitment
to abolish conclusive certificates. They also establish
a fair balance between
ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place in the review process with respect
to sensitive information,
while at the same time ensuring full independent
merits review of agencies’ decisions on FOI.
stage of the reforms is made up of a broader package of changes. The Government
introduced the
Information Commissioner Bill 2009
Freedom of Information
Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009
into the parliament on 26 November 2009,
following public consultation on exposure drafts of these Bills earlier in the
Information Commissioner Bill
will establish the office of the
Information Commissioner, which will bring together the independent oversight
functions for privacy
protection (principally regulated by the
) and for access to government information (as regulated by the FOI
Act). For this purpose, the Bill creates two new independent statutory
positions—Information Commissioner and Freedom of Information
Commissioner. It also makes provision for the appointment of
the Privacy
Commissioner in this legislation instead of under the
26 February 2010 the Government announced the appointment of Prof.
John McMillan AO as the Information Commissioner Designate.
Proposals in the
Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill
are drawn in
part from the findings of the 1995 joint Australian Law Reform Commission and
Administrative Review Council
Open Government
report. The report’s
main findings have been updated and supplemented by other measures aimed at
delivering better access to
government information.
In addition to the structural reforms, among the significant changes
envisaged for the FOI Act are the proposed agency information
publication scheme
and a change to the period for which the FOI Act will govern access to
government information. The proposed information
publication scheme establishes
a legislative framework for agencies to be proactive in the publication of
government information.
It is intended that the scheme will change the focus of
the FOI Act from one that is now largely reactive to requests being made
access to documents. The Bill will amend the
Archives Act
to bring forward the
open access period for all records (other than Cabinet note books and census
information) from 30 years to 20
years. This means the FOI Act will govern
access for 20 years instead of 30 years. The open access period for Cabinet note
is to be brought forward from 50 years to 30 years.
The Information Commissioner will be able to carry out full merits reviews of
FOI decisions made by agencies and ministers, most applications
probably being
determined on the papers. The commissioner will also take over the bulk of the
role of the Ombudsman in relation to
investigating complaints about handling of
FOI requests. The Ombudsman will still have the capacity to investigate FOI
where it would be more appropriate or effective for the Ombudsman to
do so—for example, if an FOI complaint forms part of a
wider grievance
relating to agency action or if the complaint concerns actions by the office of
the Information Commissioner.
The Bill also allows for a stronger distinction between the remedy of a
merits review function (if a person is concerned about the
correctness of an FOI
decision) and a complaints investigation function (if a person is concerned
delay or a failure to receive assistance). At
present, if a person makes a complaint to the Ombudsman about an FOI application
cannot make an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for
review of the decision. That limitation will be removed by
the Bill, with the
intention that a person’s grievance is handled under the appropriate
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reported
on the Bills on 16 March 2010. On 17 March 2010 the
circulated amendments it intended to move to the
Information
Commissioner Bill
Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill
Bills passed through the Parliament on 13 May 2010.

New South Wales
In February 2009 the New South Wales Ombudsman released a special report on
the state’s FOI regime.
Opening up Government
recommendations, the first of which was that ‘the government should
continue to actively encourage and require greater
proactive disclosure of
information by agencies’. An integral part of the Government’s
response to the Ombudsman’s
report is the overhaul of the state’s
FOI regime. The New South Wales Parliament has passed three new Acts, which were
to on 26 June 2009:
Information (Public Access) Act 2009
Information (Information Commissioner) Act 2009
Information (Public Access) (Consequential Amendments and Repeal) Act
It is expected that the new regime will become fully
operational in 2010. Until it does, the current New South Wales
Information Act 1989
Acting Information Commissioner Maureen Tangney has begun setting up the new
office of the Information Commissioner. The Government
intends to have a
permanent office holder appointed by the time the new legislation comes into
force. The Joint Parliamentary Committee
on the Office of the Ombudsman and the
Police Integrity Commission has accepted the
Attorney-General’s recommendation for the appointment of Deirdre
O’Donnell as New South Wales’ inaugural Information
Commissioner.
