expiring on 30 June 2030.[52]
for release 1 July 2025.[53]
The offending
At the date of the
offence, Mr Lewis, the offender, had been recently released from prison in
Queensland.[2] The offender met the
son of Mr Moon in gaol.[3] Subsequently,
the offender contacted Mr Moon and attended the residence of Mr Moon and his
in Tweed Heads.[2]
On 30 June 2012, the offender consumed
alcohol and drugs with Mr Moon and his girlfriend.[3] As the offender had been
in gaol, he
had not consumed drugs or alcohol for some time, resulting in
‘manifest’ effects from the consumption of alcohol and
cannabis.[3]
The following morning, the offender and Mr Moon recommenced drinking alcohol and
smoking cannabis.[4]
On 1 July 2012 at approximately 10:30am, Mr
Mitchell (the deceased) entered the kitchen where Mr Moon and the offender were
Both the deceased and Mr Moon were on the methadone
program.[5]
The deceased and Mr Moon argued, with the deceased accusing
Mr Moon of failing to wake him to collect his methadone.[5] The argument
intensified with no discussion of, or involvement from the
offender.[6]
The offender then stood up from the kitchen table and
proceeded to punch the deceased in the head, resulting in the deceased falling
to the ground.[7] The offender then continued, ‘seemingly to halt the
deceased's attempt to get up,’ punching the deceased
on the top of the
head and stomping with his foot on the deceased’s head ‘at least
three times.’[8]
Others attempted unsuccessfully to intervene and
the deceased was unresponsive and bleeding from the head. There was an attempt
stem the bleeding and the deceased was taken immediately to Tweed Heads
Hospital.[8]
The offender’s conduct was described by eyewitnesses
as ’out of the blue,’ responding to the comment ’you've
him‘ with words to the effect of ‘no one disrespects
Two hours later the police arrived at the Tweed Heads
property in response to contact from the hospital, where ‘Mr Moon was
intoxicated as to be of no assistance.’[10] The offender was found lying
asleep and face down in the backyard.[10] At approximately
2:20pm, a further two
hours later, the police returned to arrest the offender on outstanding warrants,
where he stated to the police
he had no knowledge of what had happened or of the
deceased.[10] The offender was released, and subject to witness statements,
re-arrested
at approximately 2:55pm the same day.[10]
The offender was
initially charged with ‘maliciously inflicting grievous bodily
harm.’[11] On 16 July 2012 the deceased
passed away, the cause of death
being ‘a cerebral haemorrhage caused by the stomping.’[11] The
offender was then charged
with murder.[11]
The offender’s
subjective circumstances
The offender is of Aboriginal descent and
was adopted ‘in the ordinary course’ by Caucasian parents at six
weeks of age.[26]
The offender experienced a ‘normal’ and
‘supportive’ upbringing and childhood until the age of nine, when
schoolyard comment resulted in him becoming ‘cognisant’ of having a
different colour to his parents.[27]
Following this incident, the
offender ‘commenced a rebellious period,’ where he searched for
other Aboriginal people ‘thinking
he would “fit in” with
them.’[29] He then formed ‘negative associates’ and
‘negative lifestyle
practices.’[30] The offender was
‘thereafter easily influenced by other Aboriginal youth and commenced
antisocial behaviour.’[30]
The offender continued school as
‘the only “non-white” student’ and was called names
The offender dropped out of school in Year 9.[30]
offender’s ‘quest for inclusion’ resulted in exposure to
drugs, alcohol, violence, abuse and criminal activity
previously ‘foreign
to him.’[31] The offender also had ‘limited involvement’ with
employment and what he
regarded as a ‘generally positive’
relationship with his two children and their mother.[31]
The offender has
no substantial mental health issues, excluding his ‘alcohol and drug abuse
and dependence.’[33] He has
a criminal history, and whilst in prison
finished Years 10 and 11 of schooling [34]. Prior to the offence he had remained
free for some thirteen years.’[36] The offender expressed
what the trial judge noted as ‘profound and genuine’
remorse for his
conduct.[35]

Sentencing Considerations: Comments
relating to the Aboriginal background of the offender and/ or indicators of
disadvantage:
Counsel for the offender referred to the principles
summarised in
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A Crim R 58.[37]
Rothman J stated
that ‘this is not a traditional Fernando case,’ noting that the
principles ‘are well known.’[37]
Justice Rothman stated that the
principles focus on persons ‘Aboriginal or otherwise, from
a deprived background’ where alcohol or physical abuse ‘are
norms of conduct.’[37]
He then noted that the offender’s
circumstances arose from his exclusion at school and in his neighbourhood, and
reflect his home environment.’[38] The trial judge noted
however that ‘nevertheless, there are analogies.’[38]
commented that the ‘new associations’ formed from the
offender’s attempt to find a peer group ‘led,
it seems, to his
downfall.’[32]
Note: Comments relating to social exclusion in
relation to Aboriginal disadvantage:
Rothman J then considered the
supplementary submissions from the counsel of the offender, which cited passages
focusing on factors
of social exclusion from the work of Professor
Baumeister.[39] His Honour then stated that ‘more to the point seem to be
factors of social exclusion’ referred to in the Baumeister
studies.[39]
Rothman J cited at length R.F Baumeister & C.N DeWall,
’The Inner Dimension of Social Exclusion: Intelligent Thought and
Self-Regulation Among Rejected Persons‘ (2005)
Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology
, including the passage:
Rejected or excluded people exhibit poorer self-regulation in many spheres.
They also show impairments in intelligent thought, though
these are limited to
forms of thought that are linked to self-regulation (that is, thinking processes
that depend on effortful control
by the self's executive functioning).[41]
His Honour stated that social exclusion ‘in a similar manner to
’ may be ‘used to mitigate or fashion an appropriate
sentence’ however not insofar as to ‘to impose a sentence
not reflect the seriousness of the offence.’[43]
Justice Rothman
concluded that murder is the most serious offence, noting that the particular
crime of the offender was ‘objectively
below mid-range of the range of
criminal conduct within that offence.’[44] Stating that he had considered
the matters ‘significant
and relevant’ to the sentence, of which
most are included in
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
the judge noted that the spontaneous nature of the crime and its circumstances,
the subjective elements of the offender and his
remorse were taken into
particular account.[45] The judge found for special circumstances reflecting the
‘utilitarian value’
of the offender’s guilty plea, allowing a
15 per cent reduction in sentence.[46]
‘This is not a traditional
Those principles are well known and I will not now repeat them. They largely
deal with persons, whether Aboriginal or otherwise,
from a deprived background
where abuse of alcohol and physical abuse are accepted norms of
conduct.’[37]
In a most helpful submission, aided by an equally
The Crown acknowledged its possible application, at page seven of its
supplementary Crown submissions, in the following terms:
It is accepted that the evidentiary material provides the court with some
bases to conclude that the offender did suffer social exclusion
in his formative
years. From the Baumeister Study it would appear that the offender's reaction to
social exclusion by connecting
with his cultural peers and resorting to an
antisocial lifestyle marked by alcohol and drug abuse, violence and criminality
was expected
and possibly inevitable.[40]
‘It seems, in a similar manner to
, such a factor,
as that espoused by Professor Baumeister, may be used to mitigate or fashion an
appropriate sentence, but not so
as to impose a sentence that does not reflect
the seriousness of the offence.’[43]
Not applicable
Grounds of Appeal:
applicable, decision at first instance.
Rothman J made a finding for special circumstances, allowing an approximate
15 per cent reduction in sentence for the utilitarian
value of the plea of
guilty.[46]
2. The offender was convicted of murder and sentenced to
imprisonment for a non-parole period of 13 years, commencing 1 July 2012
