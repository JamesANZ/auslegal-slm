REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Applicant applied by letter dated 8 May 2009 for the Tribunal to review the
decision originally made on 26 June 2000 by the Physiotherapy
Board of New South
Wales (Board) to remove her name from the Register.
Applicant has made numerous Applications for review of the Order removing her
name from the Register. Each Application has sought
re-registration. The details
of each Application are set out below. These Applications have all been
unsuccessful.
Background material
Applicant came before a Board Inquiry in 2000. The Complaint before the Board
Inquiry related to the conduct of the Applicant
and her impairment on the basis
of mental illness. The Board proceeded to make an Order removing the
Applicant’s name from
the Register on the basis of her mental impairment
and her professional misconduct.
August 2001 the Applicant made an Application for re-registration (an
application to review the Order removing her name from the
Register in
accordance with
section 82)
to the Board. The records indicate that the
Applicant placed no additional information before the Board in support of her
application.
The Applicant did attend upon an expert psychiatrist for the
purpose of a report being prepared. The report indicated that the Applicant
suffered from a mental illness in the upper end of the spectrum of paranoid
personality disorder to paranoid schizophrenia. This
application was
unsuccessful.
August 2003 the Applicant made a second application for re-registration. On this
occasion as the Physiotherapists Tribunal of New
South Wales had commenced
operation and therefore the application came before a Tribunal. The Tribunal
conducted an Inquiry over
three days (22 January 2004, 26 February 2004 and 14
April 2004). The Applicant was examined by Dr Samuels, psychiatrist, after the
first day of the Inquiry and he appeared before the Tribunal on 26 February 2004
to give evidence.
Dr Samuels had expressed the view that the Respondent was fit to work as a
physiotherapist provided a number of conditions
were placed upon her
Registration. Dr Samuels’ attention was drawn to a number of entries in
the large amount of documentation
tendered on behalf of the HCCC detailing
conduct of the Applicant. Dr Samuels was provided with the transcript of the
of the Inquiry and observed the Applicant giving evidence on the
morning of the second day of the Inquiry.
considering this additional information, Dr Samuels was of the opinion that the
Respondent suffered from a mental illness toward
the serious end of the spectrum
of paranoid personality disorder to paranoid schizophrenia.
length of the Inquiry was extended due to the Applicant, abruptly and without
notice or the leave of the Tribunal, leaving the
hearing room part way through
the evidence of Dr Samuels.
Orders dated 14 April 2004 the Tribunal dismissed the application for
re-registration and fixed a period of 12 months before which
the Applicant would
be entitled to make a further application. At the conclusion of the Inquiry the
Applicant indicated that she
would be leaving Australia and therefore it was
necessary for the Tribunal to fix a period of time wherein she was not entitled
re-apply for registration.
Tribunal informed the Applicant at the conclusion of the Inquiry that she would
need to provide any future Tribunal with evidence
that she had developed insight
into her mental illness, in particular she should have undertaken appropriate
treatment from health
professionals such as psychiatrists, general practitioners
and psychologists.
Applicant made a third application for re-registration in May 2005. The
Applicant again agreed to be examined by a psychiatrist
and she nominated Dr
Keith Mayne. Dr Mayne prepared two reports for the Tribunal, one dated 14
November 2005 and the other 28 February
2006. The Tribunal once again conducted
a full Inquiry. The Applicant only relied upon her statement dated 19 August
Dr Mayne expressed the opinion that the Applicant showed no evidence of
psychiatric disorder rather she had paranoid personality
over-sensitivity to criticism and a degree of suspiciousness of the motive of
others. The first report from Dr Mayne detailed
a set of conditions that the
Applicant had agreed she would comply with should her registration be restored.
number of letters written by the Applicant to Mr Morris Iemma (then the Minister
for Health in NSW), Mr Tony Abbott (then the Federal
Minister for Health) and
the CEO of her former employer (an Area Health Service) were tendered to the
Tribunal by the HCCC and accepted
in to evidence. The content of these letters
are set out in some detail in paragraph 7 of the Tribunals decision dated 4 July
The content of these letters may be summarised as bizarre.
receipt of copies of these letters Dr Mayne expressed the opinion in his second
report that the Applicant was not fit for registration
and stated that the
‘Clearly demonstrate evidence of major thought disorder,
paranoid, delusional material and mental disorganisation. Given the
availability
of this written information I would conclude that Ms Rasaiah suffers from
chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness’.
Tribunal refused to re-register the Applicant finding that she was currently
suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness
which required psychiatric
treatment. The Reasons for Decision document records that there was discussion
with the Applicant concerning
the role of the letters written to the above
mentioned politicians and officials in the findings of her unfitness. The
stated to the Tribunal that she would not write letters of this nature
if her Registration was restored.
Tribunal also found that the Applicant lacked insight into the fact that she was
suffering from a condition that required treatment.
The Tribunal further ordered
that the Applicant was not entitled to make an application for re-registration
for a period of two years.
fourth application was made on 25 October 2008. At a lengthy Directions Hearing
held on 4 December 2008 the Applicant indicated
that she would withdraw her
application. Once again the Applicant had no medical evidence to place before
the Tribunal.
fifth application for re-registration was made by the Applicant by way of a
letter dated 8 May 2009. The Applicant did not appear
before the Tribunal at
Directions Hearing on 4 August 2009. A further Directions Hearing was set for 19
February 2010 and the Applicant
duly informed. The Applicant did not appear on
19 February 2010 and the HCCC submitted that the application should be
Applicant sent a letter dated 17 November 2009 to the Registrar of the Board.
The letter stated that she wished to withdraw her
application to have her name
restored to the Register. The letter also advised that the Applicant had written
to the Federal Health
Minister, the Hon. Nicola Roxon M.P.
over the management, & settlement of my case, without
registration’
. The letter concludes
‘The case no longer
remains with the incompetent NSW Health Department’
Tribunal has the implied powers that allow the Tribunal to fulfill the
obligations placed upon it by the Act. It is incumbent
upon the Tribunal not to
allow its processes to be abused or used inappropriately. As the full Tribunal
had not convened the Tribunal
was limited as to the powers that could be
exercised and orders that could be made.
Tribunal notes that many of the documents placed before the Tribunal authored by
the Applicant indicate that she has made representations
to people such as the
state and federal Ministers for Health and the NSW Department of Health in an
endeavour to regain her registration.
This should be seen in the context of the
Applicant having had the process of making an application for re-registration
and the legislative
provisions for the restoration of her Registration being
explained in detail by the Chairpersons of each of the Tribunal Inquiries
the subsequent Directions Hearing that she attended.
Application made by the Applicant is patently hopeless. This Application has to
be seen in the context of three failed Applications
for re-registration and one
withdrawn Application extending over a period of nearly ten years. On each
occasion the Application has
been made not only without evidentiary basis but
without any evidence other than the Applicant’s assertion that she should
have her registration restored.
the Tribunal and the HCCC have limited resources which should be used for
genuine and appropriate matters. The Tribunal is of
the view that unless any
future application for re-registration is accompanied by appropriate medical
evidence that such application
should be viewed as an abuse of process.
repeated bringing of unmeritorious applications summarised above would in itself
present a difficulty for the Applicant to be
able to demonstrate that she has
overcome the impairment identified in the Board Inquiry and in evidence before
each of the two Tribunal
Tribunal notes that the Applicant withdrew the current Application for
re-registration and the Application is formally dismissed.
