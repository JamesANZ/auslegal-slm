INTRODUCTION
Panel, Sylvia Falzon, Neil Pathak (sitting President) and Richard Phillips,
declined to conduct proceedings on an application

in relation to the affairs of Vmoto Limited. The application concerned (among
other things) transactions
involving alleged transfers of Vmoto shares to
entities selected by the Board in the context of a proposed de-listing and
board spill meeting. The Panel considered that there was no reasonable
prospect that it would declare the circumstances unacceptable.

shareholder of Vmoto holding 5.83%. Vmoto’s other substantial
shareholders are its Managing Director who holds 12.03%
and three other
shareholders who hold 11.71%, 9.56% and 6.74% respectively.
13 October 2023, Vmoto announced a non-underwritten non-renounceable 1 for 4
entitlement offer at $0.15 per share to raise approximately
$10.8 million
Entitlement Offer
) to fund (among other things) the building of
manufacturing facilities in China. The Prospectus in relation to the
Entitlement Offer
stated that “
[a]ny Entitlements not taken up under
the Entitlement Offer (including the Top Up Facility) will form the Shortfall
and the Directors
reserve the right, subject to the requirements of the Listing
Rules and the
Corporations Act
, to issue the Shortfall at their discretion...
Shortfall Offer
20 November 2023, Vmoto announced that the Entitlement Offer had closed with a
shortfall of approximately 35 million shares ($5.3
million) and that the
shortfall would be offered to investors who are invited to participate in the
Shortfall Offer.
6 December 2023, Vmoto announced that it had received strong support from new
investors and existing shareholders for the Shortfall
Offer which had closed
significantly oversubscribed with applications for approximately 68 million
shares ($10.2 million) and that
to accommodate the excess demand Vmoto had
decided to undertake a ‘follow-on placement’ of approximately 32
million shares
($4.9 million) on the same terms as the Entitlement Offer.
14 March 2024, Vmoto announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire
the remaining 50% interest in the issued capital
of Vmoto Soco Italy srl and
take Vmoto’s interest to 100%.
27 May 2024, Vmoto announced that it had established an opt-out small holdings
sale facility (
Small Holdings Sale Facility
) to provide holders of Vmoto
shares with a market value of less than $500 the opportunity to have their
shares sold without incurring
any brokerage or handling costs.
on 27 May 2024, Vmoto announced that it had issued approximately 11 million
shares as consideration (
Consideration Share Issue
) for the acquisition
of the remaining 50% interest in Vmoto Soco Italy srl.
23 July 2024, Vmoto announced that it had completed the Small Holdings Sale
Facility, which had resulted in approximately 0.46%
of its issued capital being
sold at the sale price of $0.1373, reducing the total number of shareholders by
1,169 shareholders.
16 December 2024, Vmoto announced an intention to de-list from the ASX
Proposed De-listing
) subject to obtaining the required shareholder
approval by way of a special resolution to be put forward at a general meeting
to be held on or around early March 2025. The announcement also stated
(among other things):
(a) that Vmoto had received formal advice from ASX that it will agree to the
removal from the ASX on a date to be determined, subject
to satisfaction of the
relevant conditions
(b) the reasons for seeking de-listing, which included that the public share
price does not reflect its underlying value
(c) that Vmoto intended to undertake an off-market
equal access share buy-back (
) for up to 10% of the smallest
number of Vmoto shares that Vmoto had on issue over the 12 months preceding the
(d) that all Vmoto directors have confirmed that they do not intend to
participate in the Buy-back and
[d]epending on interest in the
Buy-Back, the Company may, at its sole discretion, undertake a further exit
mechanism for shareholders
before the Delisting (if approved by shareholders) by
way of a further buy-back (subject to shareholder approval) or a share sale
Buy-back was open from 2 January 2025 to 31 January 2025. The Supplementary
Buy-Back Booklet dated 2 January 2025 stated that
the price for the Buy-back had
been set at $0.12 per share, which represented a premium of 8.6% to the 20-day
volume weighted average
price of the shares traded on the ASX up to the close of
trading on 12 December 2024.
21 January 2025, Vmoto released an Appendix 2A stating that it had issued
Employee Share Issue
) 8.4 million shares to employees “
recognition of their efforts and contribution to the Company
approximately 1.3 million shares to consultants “
in lieu of cash
payment for salaries
23 January 2025, the applicant and three related entities lodged a
section 249D
notice requisitioning a meeting (
Section 249D
) to consider
resolutions to remove each of the incumbent Vmoto directors other than the
Managing Director and resolutions to appoint
two new Vmoto directors. In their
members’ statement under
section 249P
of the same date, the requisitioners
stated that their “
primary issues
” related to (among other
things) the Proposed De-listing and Buy-back, loss of market confidence and
other matters relating
to Board performance.
3 February 2025, Vmoto announced that it had received applications representing
approximately 143% of the maximum number of shares
that Vmoto could buy-back
under the Buy-back terms and that due to this demand the Buy-back would be
scaled back proportionately.
4 February 2025, Vmoto announced that the
Section 249D
Meeting had been
scheduled for 6 March 2025 and released a notice of meeting and explanatory
statement to shareholders. The notice
of meeting stated that the Board
recommends that shareholders vote against all resolutions. The notice of
meeting also included
a letter to shareholders which contained the following
statement (and other similar statements):

APPLICATION
application lodged on 17 February 2025, the applicant sought a declaration of
unacceptable circumstances. The applicant submitted
(among other things)
(a) The Proposed De-listing follows “
a number of transactions that have
involved significant oppression of minority shareholders and the transfer of
22.6% of the company’s
shares to entities selected by the board to receive
those shares in unacceptable
circumstances
Vmoto Board is “
building support for their proposals
(b) The Proposed Delisting “
will deliver the board members the benefits
that come from removing the protections that the listing rules provide
(c) The Buy-back was “
at a fraction of the depreciated value of the
company’s tangible assets, 15 days...before the end of [its] financial
shareholders were completely uninformed about the company’s
recent performance
” and was “
clearly not in all shareholders
best interests
(d) The Entitlement Offer was contrary to Guidance Note 17 including because the
Board had no intention of, and made no attempt to,
” Shortfall Shares, and having regard to Vmoto’s need for
(e) Certain substantial shareholders of Vmoto had not lodged substantial
shareholder notices.
(f) The notice of meeting in relation to the
Section 249D
Meeting contained
misleading statements concerning the requisitioners’ intentions and the
accompanying voting form was causing
applicant sought interim orders to:
(a) postpone the
Section 249D
Meeting until the matters in the application are
investigated and
(b) require Vmoto to disclose details of the recipients of shares issued in
connection with the Entitlement Offer and follow-on placement
transactions and if there are any relationships between those recipients and any
of the directors.
applicant sought final orders to the following effect:
(a) cancellation of the existing
Section 249D
Meeting and the convening of a
fresh meeting that has the alleged false and misleading statements and voting
paper manipulation removed
to the Panel’s satisfaction
(b) imposing voting restrictions on Board members and the recipients of shares

unacceptable circumstances to dispose of the shares in a manner acceptable
(d) reversing the Employee Share Issue.
have considered all the materials but address specifically only those we
consider necessary to explain our reasoning. The materials
(a) A preliminary submission from Vmoto submitting that we should decline to
conduct proceedings.
(b) An out of process rebuttal to Vmoto’s preliminary submission from the
applicant and further responses to that rebuttal
from each of Vmoto and the
applicant, each of which we decided to
(c) Three submissions made by other Vmoto shareholders as non-parties which
supported and substantially overlapped with submissions
made by the applicant in
the application, along with a rebuttal submission from Vmoto to those
submissions and a further response
from the applicant, each of which we decided
to receive.
Allegations concerning issues or transfers of Vmoto shares to supportive
shareholders
submitted that the application makes “
vague and unsupported
” that the Vmoto Board has sought to issue shares to a group
of supportive shareholders through various issues of shares dating
October 2023, and that the applicant has failed to identify any shareholders of
Vmoto who it considers to be associated or
acting in concert and does not
identify a block of voting power that is alleged to be the subject of an
association. Vmoto also
referred to the hurdle test for association
and submitted that the
applicant had failed to demonstrate any patterns of behaviour or uncommercial
dealings supporting an inference
of association, and had merely made
allegations, without evidence, in the hope that the Panel would exercise its
powers to cure deficiencies
in the application.
applicant subsequently submitted that its application was not reliant on
establishing associations. However, it appeared to us
that the applicant was,
at least in part, alleging there was some form of association or relationships
between the directors of Vmoto
and other shareholders that were unacceptable.
For example, the applicant referred to the need to “
prevent people who
were hand picked by the board to receive large numbers of shares, from voting
their shares against the spill motion
resolutions
”. It also included
references to a “
group of shareholders
” being chosen to
to receive the benefit of favourable treatment
shares being placed “
into friendly hands
”. The applicant
submitted that the Employee Share Issue placed shares “
in the hands of
supporters so the directors could benefit from their support for their
”. However, the submissions lacked specificity and were not
accompanied by any probative supporting evidence.
applicant also made submissions which appeared to allege uncommercial dealings.
For example, in relation to the Consideration
Share Issue, the applicant
submitted that the associated transaction was “
far from arms
” and that “
the reasons offered to support bringing the
transaction forward in the lead up to the proposed delisting do not make any
”. The applicant also made references in other
submissions to shares having been issued “
very cheaply
on very favourable terms with invited parties
”. Again, such
assertions, unaccompanied by supporting evidence, did not take us very far.
Dragon Mining
, the Panel has limited
investigatory powers, and as such, an applicant must do more than make
allegations of association and rely
on the Panel to substantiate them. We
considered the applicant had provided mere fragments of an association claim
which were difficult
to thread together. It fell well short of providing a
sufficient body of material to warrant us conducting further enquiries as
association or some other form of unacceptable relationship. This is
particularly so having regard to the significant timeframe
over which the
applicant has asked us to investigate issues.
applicant also made a number of submissions to the effect that the conduct of
the Board in issuing shares to supportive parties
“suppressed”
minority shareholders. We do not
consider this aspect of the allegations to be a matter for us. It is open to
the applicant to consider
bringing a shareholder oppression suit in the courts
if it wishes.
Proposed De-listing and Buy-back
applicant also made complaints in relation to the Proposed De-listing and the
Buy-back. The Panel considered (and made a declaration
of unacceptable
circumstances) in relation to a proposed de-listing and associated buy-back in
Flinders Mines Limited 02 and
where it stated as follows
The decision of a company’s board to seek
to de-list involves the exercise of business or commercial judgement, and may be
to (among other things) requirements of the applicable listing rules,
the discretions and policy of the relevant listing authority,
duties and minority shareholders remedies. It is not the Panel’s role, in
the ordinary course, to opine on
such judgements or enforce requirements for
which other regulators or the courts have primary responsibility. However, the
of such requirements does not prevent the Panel exercising its
role. In our view, where de-listing has or is likely to have an effect on
control or the acquisition of a substantial interest
in a listed company, and
appears inconsistent with the purposes in
section 602
, it is appropriate for us
to consider whether it gives rise to unacceptable
circumstances....
submitted that the Board had made a unanimous decision to pursue the Proposed
De-listing after having obtained independent financial
and legal advice, Vmoto
had obtained in-principle approval from the ASX for the Proposed De-listing, and
that there is no proper
basis to conclude that it gives rise to concerns having
regard to the purposes in
section 602.
also submitted that the Buy-back did not materially enhance or entrench any
person’s control of Vmoto and provided a table
showing the increases in
the relevant interests and voting power of Vmoto’s existing substantial
shareholders
, which it submitted
were materially below examples which the Panel has found to be acquisitions of a
substantial interest for the
purposes of

Flinders Mines Limited 02 and
applicant submitted that the Buy-back was announced at a time when the market
was waiting to be updated on annual profit forecast
and was done “
the auspices of giving shareholders who didn’t want to own shares in an
unlisted entity an opportunity to exit at a fraction
of the net asset
”. The three non-party shareholders also included as part of
their submissions complaints regarding the price of the Buy-back.
applicant further submitted that the timing of the Buy-back was unacceptable
because it “
removed 10% of shareholders who weren’t in favour of
delisting before the delisting was put to the vote. Those shareholders
allowed the opportunity of certainty in relation to the delisting before having
to accept...
submitted that the Buy-back was undertaken in an efficient, competitive and
informed market in circumstances where Vmoto was
in compliance with its
continuous disclosure obligations at all times and had prepared fulsome
disclosure through the preparation
of a buy-back booklet.
a buy-back in close proximity to Vmoto’s upcoming periodic financial
disclosure did appear to us to be unusual.
That said, participation in the
Buy-back was optional and Vmoto had foreshadowed that it may offer other exit
mechanisms for shareholders
de-listing.
We also note that
the ASX in its guidance on de-listing encourages the implementation of a
buy-back or other facility that allows
shareholders to sell or redeem their
shares for “
a nominated period up to, and/or following, the removal of

Timeliness and extended time frame of allegations
of the material referred to in the application related to matters that occurred
some time ago.
Panel application must be made within 2 months after the circumstances have
occurred or a longer period determined by the
applicant included in the application a request for an extension of time,
submitting “
[w]e request favourable consideration of an extension of
time because it is now apparent that the dominant Managing Director has been
preparing the ground over a much longer period than 2 months to achieve his
ambition to take control of the company by reducing the
number of shares in
minority hands and putting shares into friendly hands after he successfully
restructured the board
”. This submission, which we take to be an
explanation for the applicant’s delay, appeared to suggest that the
circumstances arose even earlier than the time of the Entitlement Offer.
submitted, with reference to the factors set out in
Webcentral Group Limited
, that we should not
exercise our discretion to extend time including because:
(a) matters set out in the application such as the Entitlement Offer, the
Consideration Share Issue and the Small Holdings Sale Facility
are substantially
out of time
(b) the application fails to make any credible allegations of unacceptable
circumstances
(c) no essential matters supporting the application came to light within the two
months preceding the application and
(d) the applicant has provided no explanation for the delay in bringing the
application.
do not consider it is appropriate to undertake inquiries into matters stretching
back almost 18 months ago having regard to the
nature of the allegations, the
lack of probative evidence supporting those allegations and the time and
resources involved in undertaking
such inquiries. In relation to the
Entitlement Offer, the applicant’s complaints concerning Vmoto’s
need for funds
assessment of Vmoto’s financial situation and “market factors”
at or prior to October 2023, the amount
sought to be raised and the availability
of other alternatives to raising capital at that time. As noted in Guidance
Note 17, the
Panel is likely to accept the directors’ decisions on issues
relating to a company’s need for funds where they appear
to be reasonable
unless the applicant can point to something that suggests a deeper inquiry may
be warranted.
We consider there
needs to be a very compelling reason for doing so here, and this is not apparent
to us on the materials provided.
We have similar reservations about conducting
further inquiries into decisions of the Board in relation to allocating shares
the Shortfall Offer and follow-on placement at the end of 2023 and in
relation to the Consideration Share Issue and the Small Holdings
Sale Facility
regard to our decision not to conduct proceedings, we do not consider it
necessary to reach a view on whether to formally extend
section 657C
for the making of the application.
Other matters
Substantial shareholder notices
applicant submitted that the second and third largest shareholders of Vmoto,
holding 11.71% and 9.56% of Vmoto respectively, had
failed to lodge any
substantial shareholding notices in relation to their shareholdings since first
acquiring 5% interests in connection
with the Entitlement
Vmoto submitted that it
had notified “

” to lodge an applicable substantial
shareholding notice having regard to the apparent changes in voting power
detailed in the
table it provided in relation to the
This gave us some
concerns; however, in its rebuttal the applicant noted that it had submitted a
request to ASIC to investigate
these matters. While the Panel does from time to
time make orders relating to substantial holder notice disclosure in certain
, in this instance we do
not consider there is a reasonable prospect of us making a declaration and
orders solely in relation to this
issue noting that the applicant has referred
the issue to ASIC. We also note that disclosure of the number and percentage of
shareholders’ holdings (albeit as at 8 March 2024) appeared in
Vmoto’s most recent annual report.
Complaints in relation
to the notice of meeting
applicant submitted that the letter from the Vmoto Board to shareholders in the
notice of meeting in relation to the
Section 249D
assumptions in relation to the applicants intentions and draws the false and
misleading conclusion that they are attempting
to take over the company without
making a take over bid and paying a premium

the voting form supplied with the notice of meeting, which placed the
Board’s recommendation
to vote “Against” in bold print next to
each resolution, was causing confusion and “
