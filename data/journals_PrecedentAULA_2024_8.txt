From law school to practice: Fundamentals for a successful career
By Kirsten Van Der Wal
I was the first member of my family to study law and be admitted as a lawyer.
When I started my legal journey, there was no roadmap
and no one sat me down
with advice or tips. But I realised very quickly that I loved the law and I was
determined to succeed.
In my first lecture, I recall being told that, of the people sitting in the
room, only a small percentage would become lawyers and
we would all take very
different journeys. It was explained that law students could become lawyers,
barristers, or work in government
or in various other roles. The opportunities
seemed endless.
Once I had decided that I wanted to practice as a lawyer to help
disadvantaged people, I would then get asked which area of law I
practice in. The honest answer: I didn’t know. In my second year of
university, I applied for a job in a national
law firm with the hope of getting
exposure to several practice areas before deciding. Very early on, I was
provided with the opportunity
to work in the medical negligence department and,
as they say, the rest is history.
I have continued to work in this practice area, however, I have now had
exposure to different firms and learned from different senior
lawyers, mentors
and barristers. Every experience (good and bad) has shaped my career. This
article shares my key pieces of advice
for young practitioners.
FINDING YOUR PATH
You may know early on that you want to practise as a lawyer or you may wish
to be self-employed and realise that you would be better
suited to working
independently as a barrister. A lot of people believe you need to work first as
a solicitor to decide, however,
some very successful barristers have gone
straight from university to the Bar. Others build up their connections before
considering
the Bar. It is important to remember that you are never locked in;
there are always alternative paths.
Once you have decided on your path, you need to find your edge.
FINDING YOUR EDGE
It is important to find an area of law that you are passionate about. You may
discover this on your first attempt or you may need
to trial several practice
areas. Working as a young practitioner can be taxing at times but finding an
area you have a genuine interest
in will motivate you to keep going. Find a firm
or workplace that has a great culture and one that aligns with your goals and
Once you have found your passion, you need to be prepared to make mistakes
and learn from those. This will create your edge. You can
learn lessons from
every case and more often I learn from the cases that take many twists and
turns. Take the time to seek feedback
from your supervisors and use this
CONNECTING AND LEARNING
If I had to attribute my success to one thing, it would be the mentors I had
in my early career (and still have to this day). I have
three incredible mentors
and they have acted as sounding boards and provided guidance, support,
reassurance and feedback. They offer
tips and advice on setting healthy
boundaries and creating good habits as a young practitioner. Even now that I
mentor others, I
still speak regularly with my mentors and hope to do this for
the duration of my career.
A mentor can be internal, such as a supervisor, or external, someone with
experience in the profession. Mentoring programs can be
informal or formal and
structured. Some organisations and law associations offer mentor/mentee programs
including the Women Lawyers
Association of Queensland (WLAQ).
Making meaningful connections
The only way to create true connections is to ensure your interactions are
genuine and not transactional.
Remember your friendships from university and stay in touch as there is great
comfort in sharing similar experiences with friends
in your early career.
Attending events is also a great way to meet other people in the profession and
develop your connections. The
Queensland Law Society holds early career
lawyers’ events, as do other organisations. If socialising in large groups
for you, there are still many opportunities. Every matter you work
on provides an opportunity to connect with and learn from other
lawyers and
barristers. While our work is adversarial, remember that everyone is doing the
best job they can for their client/s;
it is important to be kind and courteous.
Further education and resources
From an early stage in my career, I attended Australian Lawyers Alliance
(ALA) events and other legal seminars. It is important to
continue learning and
progressing at all stages throughout your career, however, this is especially
true in your first few years
of practice. Attending seminars on legislative
reform and case reviews is critically important as there are helpful discussions
the practical implications of the cases and/or changes. Having a great
understanding of the case law and legislation is critical
to being a technically
excellent legal practitioner. Before approaching your supervisor or asking
others for their views or help,
ensure you have first looked at the legislation,
case law and considered the options and solutions. You will get more confident
doing this if you have a good understanding of the case law and legislation
in your practice area.
I was told very early in my career that I would never stop learning and this
is true. Every day you can/will learn something new,
and you should embrace
every learning opportunity.
There are also many resources available. In my earlier years, I joined the
WLAQ committee, which provided a great opportunity to meet
people at various
stages of their careers and across many practice areas. They hold informal and
formal events and those are a great
way to meet people, make connections and
learn from others. If you have the opportunity to attend events or join
committees, I strongly
encourage this. I am a member of the Queensland Medico
Legal Society and a General Committee member of the Far North Medical and
Society Inc and I have found this to be an excellent way to learn and connect
with medical and legal practitioners throughout
Queensland.
While it can be a difficult profession and burnout is real, being a lawyer
and helping people is truly an honour. The most challenging
times can be
withstood by finding the right firm, surrounding yourself with like-minded
people and mentors, and making lifelong connections.
My final tips to share: be
kind (to yourself and others), don’t be afraid to make mistakes and
don’t forget to have fun!
