Taxation Administration Act 199
7 (TAA) came
into effect on 1 July 1997 and consolidates the
administrative provisions of the
Pay-roll Tax Act
Financial Institutions Duty Act 1982
Debits Tax Act 1990
. These Acts are defined as
‘taxation laws’ under the TAA. The purpose of the
TAA is to provide a consistent approach to the
administration of these taxes and duties in Victoria.
This Ruling outlines the circumstances and process
under which a refund will be made under the TAA.
The ruling clarifies under what circumstances the
Commissioner of State Revenue must make a refund,
the rights of a taxpayer if the Commissioner of State
Revenue refuses a refund and the requirement to
pass on a refund in certain circumstances.
Taxpayers seeking information regarding refunds
under taxation legislation not covered by the TAA
should refer to refund rulings specifically relating to
those revenue lines.
Any application for a refund received by the State
Revenue Office from 1 July 1997 must be made in
accordance with the requirements specified in
of the TAA.
An application for refund will only be considered
where the application is made by the relevant
taxpayer (as defined in
of the TAA) or
by an agent duly authorised to act on behalf of
the taxpayer.
Claims for a refund on the basis that tax has been
overpaid under a taxation law need to be in a form
approved by the Commissioner of State Revenue.
This form can be obtained from the State
Revenue Office.
An application for a refund on grounds other than
the invalidity of a provision under a taxation law
must be made within three (3) years of the payment
of the amount sought to be refunded.
Before a refund is paid in relation to overpaid duty or
tax, the overpayment will be applied to meet all
other liabilities that the taxpayer has to the Crown
under Acts administered by the Commissioner of
State Revenue. The Commissioner of State Revenue
will refund any portion of the overpayment which is
not so applied. (See TAA s.20(d)(ii))
Windfall Gains
A refund will not be paid to a taxpayer where the tax
or duty has been recovered from another person
unless the taxpayer undertakes to reimburse any
such person within 90 days after receiving the
refund. The taxpayer is then obliged to notify the
Commissioner of State Revenue in writing, within
seven (7) days of the end of this period, that the
amounts were reimbursed.
Taxpayer Rights
The Commissioner of State Revenue is required to
make a decision on any application for a refund
within three (3) months of the application being
lodged. If at the end of the three (3) months, the
Commissioner of State Revenue has not made a
refund the applicant may, within three (3) months
after that period, bring proceedings for the recovery
of the amount overpaid.
Where the Commissioner of State Revenue gives a
written determination, within three (3) months from
the date of lodgement, refusing the refund in part or
in full, the applicant may, within three (3) months
from the date of decision bring court proceedings for
the recovery of the amount refused.
Refunds (Limitations)
If a refund is claimed by reason of the invalidity of a
provision under a taxation law, recovery action is
subject to the provisions of the Limitation of Actions
Act 1958. In such cases, court proceedings for the
recovery of tax paid must begin within 12 months of
the payment of the amount sought to be refunded.

Congestion Levy Act 2005
Duties Act 2000

Payroll Tax Act 2007
Victoria has moved from a three-year period to a five-year period for refunds from 1 July 2007 as part of the

ON THE MOVE
Refunds (Objections)
A taxpayer cannot apply for a refund of an amount
paid in satisfaction of a ‘Notice of Assessment’
which the Commissioner of State Revenue has
served on the taxpayer.
A taxpayer who wishes to pursue a refund in relation
to an assessment issued by the Commissioner of
State Revenue must use the objection and appeal
provisions contained in
of the TAA.
In cases where a taxpayer’s objection is allowed in
whole or in part, or a taxpayer’s review or appeal is
upheld, the Commissioner of State Revenue must
refund any amount paid in excess of the tax payable
under the relevant taxation law.
In instances where an objection is allowed in part
or in full, or a review or appeal is upheld, the
Commissioner of State Revenue must pay interest on
the amount overpaid on a daily basis from the date
of overpayment or the date on which the assessment
was made (whichever is the later) until the date the
amount is refunded.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
