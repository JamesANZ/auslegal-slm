APPEARANCES:
Not applicable.
[1] In each of these applications
Land Valuation Act 2010
(the LVA) requires that the Court determine if
the proposed appeals may be heard and determined despite the appeal lodgement
having already elapsed.
[2] Objection decision notices in respect of
each property were issued by the Valuer-General (the respondent) on 26 March
is not in dispute, that the sixty-day appeal period expired at 4.30pm
on 26 May 2025.
[3] On Tuesday 27 May 2025 correspondence was forwarded by
the registry to SVA Property Advisory (the appellants’ agent) advising
that as the appeal notices had been received after the appeal period had
closed. This correspondence confirmed that an appeal
may be heard if the Court
is satisfied there was a reasonable excuse for not filing the notice within the
appeal period. Copies of
Land Valuation Act 2010
included with this correspondence.
[4] On 28 May 2025 directions were made
setting out a timetable for the filing of evidence and submissions by the
Legislation
Section 157(2)
of the LVA provides –

Section 158
of the LVA provides –
Late filing
section applies if a valuation appeal notice is filed after the appeal period
(2) The Land Court can hear the appeal only if—
(a) the valuation appeal notice was filed 1 year or less after the objection
decision notice was issued; and
(b) the appellant satisfies the court there was a reasonable excuse for not
filing the notice within the appeal period.
Example of reasonable
The notice of the valuer-general’s decision or the valuation appeal
notice was lost or delayed in the ordinary course of post.
Evidence and submissions on behalf of applicants
applicants rely on two
by Edwina Ryrie King, a team administrator employed by SVA Property Advisory.
One affidavit relates to the initial proposed appeals
LVA080-25 to LVA084-25,
the other relates solely to appeal LVA085-25. The distinction between the
affidavits relates to the sequence
of events and does not impact the outcome of
the applications.
[8] In each affidavit, Ms King deposes that on or about
9.00am on 26 May 2025 she prepared email correspondence attaching the six
notices of appeal for forwarding to the registry for lodgement. At approximately
9.25pm that day Ms King, after becoming aware that
no acknowledgment of receipt
had issued from the registry; checked the initial email and discovered that it
had been inadvertently
forwarded to an alternative address within SVA Property
[9] This initial email, together with the emails forwarded the
registry by Ms King at 9.25pm and 9.54pm on 26 May 2025 are all included
index of exhibits to her affidavits filed on 11 June 2025.
submissions in support of a finding of reasonable excuse are based largely on
the judgment of Muir J in Congress Community
and are set out as follows:
i. The delay in filing was slight, being less
than 6 hours.
ii. The appellant’s acted appropriately in entrusting the
appeals to agents with considerable experience in lodging appeals.
King lodged the appeals following an extended period of work.
iv. The appeals
were late because of a “slip” on the part of SVA Property
v. The appellants had done everything that could be reasonably
expected of them.
Submissions by the respondent
[11] The detailed
submissions on behalf of the respondent ultimately conclude that “the
Court should find that the applicants‘
agents administrative or clerical
error of sending the appeals to the incorrect email address and then to remedy
the errors, which
resulted in the appeals being filed the next business day
amounts to a reasonable excuse to file their appeal late under the
the agreement of the parties these applications have been able to be determined
“on the papers” without a formal
hearing. Notwithstanding the
consensus regarding a finding of reasonable excuse, the Court must still
consider the specific evidence
regarding the prevailing circumstances and
determine the issue of jurisdiction pursuant to
affidavits of Ms King comprise the only sworn evidence before the Court. The
initial email together with those subsequently
forwarded are exhibited to the
filed affidavits. Ms King has not been required for cross-examination and it is
not contended that
her evidence should not be accepted.
[14] The Court is satisfied on the evidence that the oversight
by Ms King on the morning of the final day of the appeal period is
envisaged by Muir J in Congress
and a finding of reasonable excuse must therefore follow.
[15] The Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine each of
the appeals.
1. The Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine
each appeal.
