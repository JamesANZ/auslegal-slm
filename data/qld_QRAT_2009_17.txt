Evans v Queensland Racing [2009] QRAT 17 (22 June 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
22 June 2009
Dale Andrew Evans
RESPONDENT:
Queensland Racing
APPEARANCES:
Mr Winning, solicitor for the appellant Dale Andrew Evans and
Allison Finlay on behalf of the respondent Queensland Racing
Mr Leo Williams AO – Chairman
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
The appellant is a licensed jockey who was charged with an offence under
AR175(Q) which reads:
The Committee of any Club or the Stewards may punish;
(q) Any person who in their opinion is guilty of any misconduct, improper
conduct or unseemly behaviour.
The charge was levelled by the Chairman Mr M Halliday during the course of an
Inquiry into various
against the appellant jockey. At the
Inquiry there were two charges one for improper conduct under 175(q) and another
to an issue that has not been determined by the stewards relative to
the non-payment of various cheques. The particulars of the
charge with which
this Tribunal is concerned is noted on page 2 of the transcript which was
enunciated by Mr Halliday in this regard.
The first charge is:
April 2009 you engaged in improper
conduct by conspiring with Donna Carrigg to deceive stewards, and
thereafter, creating and supplying
to Donna Carrigg an instrument
containing your urine, with a view to it being passed off to stewards as urine
supplied by Donna Carrigg.
When asked whether he understood the charge jockey Evans confirmed that he
did and indicated that he pleaded guilty and that he did
so freely and
voluntarily and of his own free will.
Jockey Evans had attended the Rockhampton Jockey Club for the purpose of
riding track work on the day in question and was notified
by stewards that he
was required to provide a urine sample as were other riders at track work on
that same day. Donna Carrigg another
track work rider and a friend of jockey
Evans was also directed to provide a urine sample and it appears that jockey
Evans provided
a means that may have availed jockey Carrigg of avoiding testing
positive. During the course of the Inquiry jockey Evans gave evidence
his opinion, jockey Carrigg on the Saturday evening prior had appeared to be
under the influence of some drug or other substance.
Donna Carrigg the other track work jockey has already been dealt with by the
stewards and by this Tribunal in matter RT008-09. The
facts leading up to her
charge and the issues also leading to the charge against jockey Evans are fully
set out in transcript of
that matter and in the Notice of Decision of this
Tribunal. It is not intended to repeat all of those issues and material facts
in these reasons but suffice to say that the appellant Evans did provide his
sample of urine in a condom with a mechanism for releasing
that condom of its
urine if jockey Carrigg so wished. It is not denied that jockey Carrigg did not
use the urine supplied to her.
Mr Halliday succinctly identified all of the steps that had been taken by
both Carrigg and Evans in his determination commencing at
page 26 of the
Transcript of the Inquiry. He was aware that Donna Carrigg had been convicted
of the offence and had been disqualified
for a period of 12 months. He was
referred by the Prosecutor Ms Finlay to a case of
which was a
decision of the Racing Appeals Tribunal in May 2007 where jockey Warrington had
attempted to use a penis device in a sample
testing exercise but was caught in
the act of attempting to utilise that device and suffered a penalty. This
Tribunal noted in the
decision of
It is commonly accepted throughout Australasia that one of the major
problems in racing is the emergence of the drug culture, both
in relation to its
administration to horses and to the use of drugs by riders. This type of case
raises a problem which goes to
the very heart of the industry
Mr Halliday used that quote and identified the comments as being apposite for
application in his determination relative to the Evans
charge. He confirmed
At the end of the day it is the function of this Inquiry to ensure that
there is a proper maintenance or proper standard of conduct
and of discipline of
licensees within the racing fraternity
Mr Halliday went further to identify that so far as Evans was concerned there
was a deliberate attempt by him to frustrate and to
nullify the Rules of Racing
and the duties of jockeys and licensees under those Rules. He determined that
an appropriate sanction
was one of a disqualification to act not only as a
personal deterrence but also to persuade other members of the racing fraternity
that conduct of this type would not be tolerated in the future. He therefore
imposed a penalty of 18 months disqualification. This
Tribunal believes that Mr
Halliday was wrong in the manner in which he came to the conclusion that
deterrents was a necessary element
even moreso in that such deterrence demanded
a penalty in excess of that handed down to the primary offender Ms Carrigg.
Ms Carrigg never used the condom and was not persuaded by Mr Evans to do so.
Mr Evans in his evidence before the Inquiry admitted
that he provided his urine
for Ms Carrigg to use if she so wished.
It is not, in the opinion of this Tribunal, reasonable to impose a penalty of
disqualification which is significantly higher than
that imposed against a
person who was positive in testing to a banned substance. Jockey Evans did not
use any substance of a banned
Throughout the course of the Appeal Mr Winning for the appellant referred to
the more recent decision in New Zealand of an action
concerning jockey Herd and
jockey Bossum. In that determination jockey Bossum, who provided the sample
received a considerably more
lenient penalty than that imposed upon jockey Herd
who used the sample from jockey Bossum to avoid a positive test. This Tribunal
believes that the arbiters of that case in New Zealand were correct.
That is not to say that what jockey Evans did was an acceptable practice. He
breached the Rules of Racing and he pleaded guilty to
a charge of improper
conduct however he did not impose his will upon anyone else and was not involved
to thwart the rules. What he did was undoubtedly wrong
and he must pay the penalty. In the Tribunal’s opinion however the
penalty is too severe. In the circumstances this appeal is upheld and in lieu
of the penalty imposed by Mr Halliday it is ordered
that Jockey Evans’ be
disqualified for a period of six months such disqualification period to be
followed by a further three
months suspension. The deposit is ordered to be
