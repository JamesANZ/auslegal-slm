REASONS FOR DECISION
On 18 October 2024, the
Commission decided to modify the draft King Island Local Provisions Schedule
(draft LPS). The King Island
LPS (as modified) became effective on 18 December
As part of its 18 October 2024 decision, the Commission found that the draft
LPS required substantial modification and accordingly,
section 35KB
Act, the Commission directed the planning authority to prepare a draft amendment
to the King Island LPS and to submit the
draft amendment to the Commission after
the LPS came into effect.
The subject draft amendment is one of five draft amendments to the King
Island LPS prepared in response to the Commission’s
direction. The King
Island Council planning authority has publicly exhibited the draft amendment in
accordance with
section 40G
and provided the Commission with its
section 40K
The draft amendment proposed to apply the
Safeguarding of Airports Code and insert the Airport Obstacle Limitation Area
overlay map.
Issues raised in representations
The draft amendment was referred to TasWater under
section 56S
Water and Sewerage Industry Act 2008
. In response
TasWater made a representation stating no objection to the draft amendment and
that TasWater did not wish to attend
any hearing.
No other representations were received in relation to the draft
Planning authority’s response to the
representations
The planning authority did not recommend any
modification to the draft amendment.

representations, statements and recommendations
contained in the planning
authority’s section 40K report and any information obtained at a
opposing representations were received, and the Commission dispensed with a
hearing in accordance with
section 40L(2)
Commission must also consider whether the draft amendment meets the LPS criteria
as set out under
section 34(2)
of the Act:
(a) contains all the provisions that the SPPs specify must be contained in an
(b) is in accordance with
(c) furthers the objectives set out in Schedule 1; and
(d) is consistent with each State policy; and
(da) satisfies the relevant criteria in relation to the TPPs; and
(e) as far as practicable, is consistent with the regional land use strategy, if
any, for the regional area in which is situated
the land to which the relevant
planning instrument relates; and
(f) has regard to the strategic plan, prepared under
Government Act 1993
, that applies in relation to the land to which the
relevant planning instrument relates; and
(g) as far as practicable, is consistent with and co-ordinated with any LPSs
that apply to municipal areas that are adjacent to the
municipal area to which
the relevant planning instrument relates; and
(h) has regard to the safety requirements set out in the standards prescribed

its approval of the draft LPS the Commission determined that it met the LPS
criteria. As part of that decision, it follows that
the Commission also
established that the directed modifications to the LPS through section 35KB were
also consistent with the LPS
further submissions were received raising any matters that warrant further
considerations against these criteria.
Commission Consideration
Commission’s decision on the King Island LPS established that it accepted
the evidence in support of the inclusion of the
Airport Obstacle Limitation Area
its decision on the King Island LPS, the Commission considered that:
the Airport
Obstacle Limitation Area overlay be included in the draft LPS to protect the
ongoing functioning of the King Island Airport
through not having buildings or
structures protruding into the airspace around the airport;
the modification
Resource Management and Planning System objective (h); and
the modification
was a substantial modification as there may be a public interest.
Commission considers that exhibition of the draft amendment has given sufficient
opportunity for any matters of public interest
to be raised. As representations
were not received in relation to the draft amendment, the Commission remains
satisfied that the
draft amendment is consistent with the LPS criteria at
section 34(2)
of the Act.
Decision on draft amendment
Commission is satisfied that the draft amendment meets the LPS criteria and
gives its approval.
