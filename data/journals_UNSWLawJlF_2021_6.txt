MATERIALITY AND JURISDICTIONAL ERROR: CONSTITUTIONAL
DIMENSIONS FOR ENTRENCHED REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE DECISIONS
EMILY HAMMOND
While the High Court of Australia has confirmed a materiality threshold
for jurisdictional error, there is ongoing debate about its
rationale. This
comment contributes to the debate by outlining a constitutional rationale for
the materiality element in judicial
review of executive decisions. Critically,
the Commonwealth
Constitution
denies Australian parliaments power to legislate a
prospective rule that rights or obligations are to be as specified in an invalid
executive decision in a federal matter. As such, a jurisdictional error by a
non-court exercising power in a federal matter engages
a significant practical
limit on legislative power. Once this is appreciated, a rationale for the
materiality threshold for jurisdictional
error becomes clear: the threshold
calibrates review to the limit on legislative power, by ensuring review is
focused on errors that
affect the decisions through which legislation

While the courts’ attention turn to more detailed issues of
implementation, questions about the rationale for the ‘practical

materiality threshold as a common law principle of statutory
interpretation.
Scholarly attention
has therefore, quite reasonably, focused on the process of statutory
construction that gives rise to the materiality
and its coherence with existing
authorities.
In this comment, I focus instead on the

of judicial power in federal matters as a basis for a materiality element. I
outline a constitutional rationale
for a materiality inquiry in review of
executive decisions in federal matters and indicate – in broad terms
may inform thinking about the precondition’s status,
content and operation.
My principal aim in this comment is to present an explanation of a
materiality threshold grounded in Chapter III of the
Constitution
That is, to outline a hypothesis that a materiality precondition plays a role in
managing an important practical limit on legislative
power associated with the
Constitution
’s separation of judicial power in federal matters. As
explained further below, the limit in question prevents Australian parliaments
from legislating a prospective rule that rights or obligations are as specified
executive decision on a federal matter – ie, a
purported decision affected by jurisdictional error. Once this limit on
legislative
power is recognised, the rationale for a materiality criterion is
revealed. The criterion serves to calibrate the impact of administrative
on the valid operation of legislation.
The comment will also briefly touch on the practical value of recognising the
constitutional premise for the materiality criterion.
My argument, in essence,
is that the
Constitution
supports an approach to the materiality inquiry
that ensures review whenever there is a risk that legal rights or obligations
treated as validly affected by legislation operating on invalid executive
decisions in federal matters. At one level, the materiality
precondition for
the separation of judicial power
in federal matters goes no further than
‘logically or practically
necessary’.
But it is important to appreciate that, in performing this role, the
precondition must
give effect to the constitutionally mandated
separation. This requires the court to adopt an approach to the materiality
in review of non-court decisions that facilitates review whenever there
is a risk that an error has affected a decision by a non-court
constitutionally
incapable of exercising judicial power. Relatedly, drawing out the
constitutional rationale for a materiality precondition
may help us to
contextualise and critique the ‘practical injustice’ threshold
applied in recent High Court authorities.
II A MATERIALITY PRECONDITION FOR JURISDICTIONAL
ERROR CONFIRMED
Judgments handed down by the High Court since 2018 articulate a materiality

executive decisions. Notably, in

applying the materiality precondition: the applicant for

the applicant meets this task of persuasion, it becomes a matter for the
to establish that the error was

discuss, the separation of powers rationale for review
of such decisions

obligations on the fact of an invalid
executive decision.
III MATERIALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENTRENCHED
It is notable that the High Court has articulated a materiality precondition
for jurisdictional error in the context of exercising
entrenched review
authority. We might therefore suppose that the precondition plays a role in
defining the boundaries of this entrenched
measure of review. Immediately, this
suggests the possibility that the precondition assists in managing limits on
legislative power
associated with entrenched review. More productively, it
suggests that the precondition reflects salient features of the constitutional
sources of entrenched review. Following this lead, we are able to see how this
precondition can operate in a principled way, to optimise
the constitutional
guarantee of legal accountability for the exercise of government powers over
legal status.
A Entrenched Review for Jurisdictional Error
As is well-known, the
Constitution
provides a minimum provision for
judicial review of
Commonwealth
public powers that cannot be denied or foreclosed by parliaments. This
entrenched provision for review covers a wide range of public
powers: any
exercise of Commonwealth non-judicial
any exercise of

The High Court has identified two sources of constitutional entrenchment for

To ascertain the precise nature of the limits on legislative power, it
necessary to examine the constitutional sources of entrenched review. When we do
this, we can isolate two dimensions of legislative
power that are denied when a
decision amenable to entrenched review is affected by jurisdictional error.
(a) Power to Legislate to Exclude or Frustrate the
Entrenched Review Jurisdiction
The first and most obvious dimension is power to legislate to exclude or
the entrenched measure for review. This limit follows directly
from the positive constitutional provision for a measure of entrenched
for jurisdictional error. That is, legislative power to oust entrenched review
for the error,
and power to
enact limits on the entrenched measure of review incompatible with the place of
that review in the constitutional

law invalidly limits review may sometimes be a difficult evaluative
However, this does not
deny the broad proposition: a finding of jurisdictional error necessarily
engages constitutional limits on legislative power over the existence, and
exercise of entrenched review.
(b) Power to Enact a Prospective Rule that Rights
Are as Specified in a Decision Made by a Repository Constitutionally Incapable
Exercising Judicial Power

executive to affect the legal rights or obligations

2 Materiality in Context of Entrenched Review and
Associated Limits on Legislative Power
To return to the main line of argument, a materiality threshold for
the limits on
legislative power associated with the entrenched provision for review. That is,
the threshold ensures that the two
dimensions of legislative power denied by the
Constitution
upon a finding of jurisdictional error are
limited any more than is practically necessary to maintain the integrity of
the constitutional scheme. This is consistent with the
orthodox approach to
drawing implications that limit legislative
In particular, the materiality threshold calibrates the impact of the strict
institutional separation of judicial power on Australian
parliaments’
power to legislate that rights or obligations are as specified in a purported
non-court decision. It is plausible
that this dimension of legislative power
should be impaired only when errors
the decision that is the
factum by which legislation operates. This is a principled point to draw the
line, given that the constitutional
concern is with the operation of legislation
on the decision
. Thus, any errors that may have occurred in connection
with the decision, but which do not affect it, ought not affect the exercise
legislative power over legal status on the fact of the decision.
As I have said, this way of articulating the rationale for the materiality
threshold is sound, and consistent with the approach to
implied limits on
legislative power. However, there is a risk that emphasising this account,
without more, would lead to an unduly
cautious or stringent approach to the
materiality inquiry. A narrow approach to ‘jurisdictional error’
cannot be justified
simply to minimise constitutional limits on legislative
power. To reason in that way might drift into an impermissible use of doctrine
to undermine the
Constitution
. There is, therefore, a need to articulate
the rationale in a way that
gives due effect
to the constitutional
matters that underpin entrenched review.
This brings us back to the underlying separation of powers rationale for
review of non-court decisions. As explained above, there
is an important
constitutional justification for review of purported
decisions by
non-courts constitutionally incapable of exercising judicial power (ie,
non-courts exercising Commonwealth powers, and
state powers in federal matters).
In this context, there is a positive rationale for review of decisions
by error. Judicial review ensures that an individual’s
legal status is not affected by force of legislation operating on decisions
without regard to a matter of fundamental constitutional significance: the
absence of inherent executive power to produce a binding
legal effect on legal
status despite jurisdictional error. This explains and requires judicial review
when a decision is affected
IV PRACTICAL VALUE OF RECOGNISING A CONSTITUTIONAL
PREMISE FOR A MATERIALITY THRESHOLD?

have noted, a lack of justification for such a significant doctrinal development
risks undermining the legitimacy of judicial
There is also an
immediate practical problem if members of the High Court are at cross-purposes
on the rationale for a materiality
element in jurisdictional error, and thus on
the appropriate approach to its application. As such, there is significant
value in providing a coherent justification for a materiality
precondition.
The constitutional basis for materiality outlined in
furnish a principled basis for its application. The constitutional premise casts
light on the counterpoised elements in
a materiality inquiry in review of
executive decisions. On the one hand, a materiality criterion ensures that
legislative power to
affect rights or obligations through administrative
decisions is not affected by immaterial administrative errors. On the other
the scheme laid down by Chapter III imposes an important
constitutional limit on legislative power to operate through executive decisions
affected by error. It is important that
elements of the materiality
inquiry are kept in view. Thinking of materiality as a tool to manage limits on
legislative power might
initially suggest a need to be sparing and cautious in
finding that an error is material. However, understanding materiality as a
characteristic that attracts a constitutional safeguard against excess of
legislative power suggests that it should operate to facilitate
unauthorised executive decisions. In principle, the materiality inquiry should
be approached in a way that ensures
review whenever there is any risk
that legislation may be attributed with an operation incompatible with the
Constitution
’s strict institutional separation of judicial power in
federal matters.
It is open to question whether the High Court’s presentation of a
‘practical injustice’ threshold for materiality
in recent decisions
strikes the right balance in this regard. A full evaluation is beyond scope for
this article. I will briefly
mention two features of the current approach that
are at odds with the constitutional rationale outlined above, before briefly
some features of the Court’s recent decisions that lay the
foundations for a more conceptually integrated approach.
One troubling feature of the current approach is of course the
majority ruling that ‘the onus of proving by admissible evidence on
the balance of probabilities historical facts necessary
to satisfy the court
that the decision could realistically have been different had the breach not
occurred lies unwaveringly on the
plaintiff’.
This ruling
does not register the importance of ensuring against excess of legislative power
to operate on rights and obligations
through executive
Placing the onus on
the decision-maker to prove immateriality, in the manner proposed by Gordon and
Steward JJ,

reflect the constitutional context:
Fundamental principles – namely, the rule of law; the constitutional
relationship between the Executive and the judicial branch;
the relationship
between individuals and the State; and, in particular, the role of the judicial
branch in the protection of the
individual against incursions of executive power
– together weigh decisively in favour of a conclusion that it is the
(the Executive) in an application for judicial review who should and
must bear the onus of establishing immateriality of
Another troubling feature of the current approach to materiality is the
impression created in the cases that a ‘practical injustice’
criterion is the default, presumptive, method of establishing materiality. This
presumption is particularly worrying for
conditions on power. In
Hossain v Minister for Immigration and Border

that statutes are ordinarily to be interpreted as incorporating a threshold of

with express or implied conditions on

This is a welcome clarification for conditions implied from the common law.
It is welcome because it recognises that the ‘practical
threshold is appropriate having regard to the nature of the conditions implied
from the common law. The ‘practical
injustice’ method of
establishing materiality suits the normative commitments underpinning those
conditions. Yet this does
not explain the Court’s elevation of
‘practical injustice’ as the presumptive method to establish
materiality for
conditions on decision-making power.
As others have pointed out, it is unclear why a separate practical injustice
inquiry is presumptively required for enacted conditions
The presumption creates a
default that jeopardises appropriate judicial enforcement of enacted constraints

think that Parliament’s provision as to who is authorised to exercise a

examples illustrate, many enacted conditions are constitutive of the
decision-making power itself. The constitutional premise
for a materiality
threshold supports review when statutory conditions that define and delimit
decision-making power are breached.
Thus, it supports further clarification that
the ‘practical injustice’ materiality inquiry is not presumptively
appropriate
for all enacted conditions on power. There would appear to be some
footholds in the current authorities for this development: the
injustice’ threshold does not seem to apply to preconditions to
nor to those enacted
conditions that go ‘to the heart’ of a decision-making
Going forward, the
Court’s approach to materiality should more clearly allow that the
‘practical injustice’ threshold
is not presumptively appropriate for
all enacted conditions. Some enacted conditions may be
central to the
legislation’s operation on rights or obligations that
must be considered material.

V CONCLUSION
illustrates, implementing a materiality precondition for
basis for the requirement can assist in navigating the complexities. At one
level, it is true that a materiality element assists
in managing the impact of
entrenched review on legislative power. It enables the courts to refine the
point at which constitutional
limits on legislative power associated with
entrenched review are engaged. At a deeper level, the materiality inquiry is an
element in securing
the constitutional foundations for
entrenched review. In particular, materiality plays a role in ensuring that
legislation does not
operate to affect rights or obligations on the fact of
invalid decisions by non-courts constitutionally incapable of exercising
power. While it is of course important that implied limits on
legislative power have a firm basis in the
Constitution
’s text and
structure, it is also imperative that the limits are maintained. For this
reason, it is critical that the courts’
approach to the materiality
inquiry enable
review whenever there is any risk that legislation may be
purporting to operate on the fact of a non-court decision in an unconstitutional
– as well as unjust – way.

purpose (compared
with a prohibited consideration) is critiqued in Mark Aronson,
Matthew Groves and Greg Weeks,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action and
Government Liability
(Lawbook, 6
ed, 2017) 324–5.
A materiality requirement was earlier
applied to statutory codes of procedure that are exhaustive statements of the
natural justice
hearing rule: see
Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v
(2009) 238 CLR 627
, 640 [35]–[36] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne,
Crennan and Bell JJ). The materiality requirement is
present in the
general approach for express enacted requirements stated in
Project Blue Sky
Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority
[1998] HCA 35
(1998) 194 CLR 355:
[91] (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) (‘
Project Blue
’). It appears in later restatements of that test, including
v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection
[2015] HCA 51
(2015) 257 CLR 22
(Gageler and Keane JJ), adopted in
[2018] HCA 34
(2018) 264 CLR 123
[29] (Kiefel CJ, Gageler and Keane JJ). This shift is noted in
commentary: see, eg, Aniulis (n 10) 94; Chiam (n 14).

Cf ibid 453 [33] (Kiefel CJ,
Gageler, Keane and Gleeson JJ), 477–8 [159]–[164] (Edelman J).
For instance, how proof of the
materiality element is inflected by locating it within an inquiry into whether a
fair-minded lay
observer might reasonably apprehend the possibility that the
decision may have been affected: cf ibid 461 [72] (Kiefel CJ, Gageler,
Keane and Gleeson JJ).

The breadth of this provision is
attributable to
sections 75(iii)
and (v) together with the
constitutional source of entrenchment – ie, the implication that
denies Commonwealth legislative power to vest judicial power
other than in a
court: see below n 30.
See authorities collated in Aronson,
Groves and Weeks (n 17) 47 n 146.
This reflects the source of
entrenchment as articulated in

While Gageler J’s reasons emphasised a
distinct inherent incapacity to
detain (at 105 [159]), this was necessary because the detention challenged in
the case occurred outside
Australian territory (at 103 [153]) and his
Honour’s comments should not be taken to cast doubt on the inherent
to dispense with the general system of law. See also
