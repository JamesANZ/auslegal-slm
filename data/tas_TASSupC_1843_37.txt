GENERAL GOAL DELIVERY.
Before His Honor Mr. Justice Montagu, and a Jury of Twelve
The Solicitor-General conducted the prosecutions; Mr. Sorell, owing to the indisposition of Mr. Lewis, acted as Clerk
of the Court.
Julia Slack
was charged with having stolen from the shop of Martin Collins, a pair of slippers. The prisoner, in her defence, alleged the property
to be her own, and it certainly appeared, even in the evidence for the prosecution, that she did not attempt to conceal the articles,
but on their having been taken from her by Collins, demanded them from him, and stated from whom she had purchased them. Verdict
- Not Guilty.
In ordering the prisoner's discharge, the learned Judge said that he hoped this might be a warning to her not again to indulge
in the use of spirituous liquors. That she had not appeared to be a bad character, and her first offence in this colony, but he hoped
she would avoid exhibiting to her little child the scope which it this morning witnessed, - a mother placed at the dock and charged
with an offence, and a serious one, against the laws of the realm. His Honor said that he had no doubt the prisoner was intoxicated
at the time she was charged with this theft, and he hoped the narrow escape would teach her to avoid that baneful, pernicious, and
destructive poison. His Honor said he called it poison, because he was convinced that it was so to the human frame, and that in a
hundred years, or perhaps less, its use would be almost unknown, and that posterity would look back with wonder at the extent of
its influence on men of the present day.
