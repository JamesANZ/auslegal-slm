Legislation

Health Professionals
Regulation 2004
Dr Javaid has been practicing Nuclear Medicine at
October 2003. Since that time Dr Javaid has held a series of conditional
registrations provided to him by the Medical
Board of the
Australian Capital Territory
(�the Board�).
Initially Dr Javaid
was granted conditional registration on the basis that he was filling an
�area of unmet need�, although
it is questionable whether the position
strictly met these requirements. Registration was later granted on the
that Dr Javaid commence the process necessary to be granted
full, unconditional registration, as the Board was of the view
registration could not be continued in such an indeterminate way.
Javaid�s most recent application to the Board was made on 18 July 2007. After
considering the application the Board ultimately
declined to grant Dr Javaid
registration. Dr Javaid subsequently applied to the Health Professions Tribunal
to review the decision
under power granted by the
Health Professionals Act 2004
(�the Act�). In
applying for review, Dr Javaid sought one of two orders from the Tribunal.
First, that the Tribunal order that
Dr Javaid be registered as a specialist medical
practitioner. Second, that the Tribunal order that Dr Javaid be granted
conditional
registration on public interest grounds.
Legislative Scheme
tenor of the
Health Professionals Act
(ACT) is set by
section 13.
Sub-section (1) provides that:
The main object of this Act is to protect the public from risk of harm by
ensuring that the people who provide health services are
competent to provide
health services and to help health professionals in professions regulated by
this Act to achieve and maintain
the required standard of practice.
Tribunal is given power to review decisions of the Board by
section 46(2)
the Act. The Tribunal may consider an application
Health Professionals
(ACT) s 62A(2). The powers granted are wide ranging, allowing it
to make any �order it considers appropriate�:
Health Professionals Act 2004
considering the application made on behalf of Dr Javaid, the Tribunal must
consider the legislative scheme that governs the
registration of health
professionals in the
Capital Territory
of the Act is the core
provision setting out the requirements that must be met for registration as a
health professional. In particular
section 37(1)
relevantly stipulates that the
following must be satisfied:
the person satisfies the suitability to
practise requirements for the profession;
Health Professionals
Regulation 2004
(ACT) (�the Regulations�) sets out the �suitability to
practice� requirements, requiring that an individual:
has the qualifications for the health
profession or specialist area set out in the schedule for the health
profession; and
has successfully completed training (which may
include an internship) set out in the schedule for the health profession or
������������������������
is generally competent.
Board may register a person conditionally or unconditionally under
of the Act. When a person does not satisfy the requirements for
unconditional registration in
of the Act,
Regulation 116(1)
the Board the power to register the person conditionally where two
preconditions are satisfied. First, registration of
the practitioner must be in
the public interest:
Regulation 116(1)(a)
; and second, registration of such
person will not endanger public safety:
Regulation 116(1)(b).
Regulation 117(1)
defines when the granting of conditional registration will be in the public
interest, although this list is not exclusive:
Regulation 117(2).
This provision
gives the Board and the Tribunal broad powers with regard to persons who do not
strictly meet the �suitability to
practice requirements�
Medicine is not a specialist area of medicine in
under the legislative
scheme. It is a sub-speciality of both Diagnostic Radiology and Adult Medicine.
As such, a practitioner seeking
specialist registration in this field must be
registered as either a specialist in Diagnostic Radiology with the Fellowship
the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists, or as a
specialist in Adult Medicine with the Fellowship of the
of Physicians:
section 2.4
, Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Dr Javaid possesses neither
qualification, nor would be entitled to a Fellowship of either of the
without undertaking further undergraduate type studies.
Dr Javaid�s
Javaid commenced his medical career in
where he was awarded a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery by the
After gaining some experience in Pakistan, Dr Javaid relocated to the United
Kingdom to undertake further studies, in particular
training in the speciality
of Nuclear Medicine at the Kings College Hospital and Medical School. He was
awarded the degree of Masters
in Science in Nuclear Medicine in 1987 after the
completion of clinical training, research programs, and the submission of
papers. He then commenced further study at
receiving a Doctor of Philosophy in Nuclear Medicine in 1992. While undertaking
these further studies Dr Javaid held the position
of Trainee Registrar (1986 �
1988) and Research Fellow (1988 � 1996).
completion of his Doctorate, Dr Javaid commenced employment with the King
Abdulaziz Hospital and Oncology Centre in
Saudi Arabia
. He was employed as a
Consultant Nuclear Medicine Physician, overseeing all examinations and
procedures performed in the area of
Nuclear Medicine. Dr Javaid held this
position from 1993 to 1996. Dr Javaid then gained employment with the
Saudi Arabia
as a Consultant and Head of the Nuclear Medicine Division. Dr Javaid left this
position to commence employment with The Canberra
Hospital in October 2003.
Registration was provided to Dr Javaid prior to arriving in Australian on the
basis that he was filling
an area of unmet need.
evidence of Dr Javaid is that he was unaware of any problems or potential
problems with his registration when taking the position
at The Canberra
Hospital. He first had cause for concern on or about 24 February 2003 when he
received an email from Vicki Oates
containing the conditions to be placed upon
his registration. Two matters in particular gave him cause for concern: first,
he would be required to practice Nuclear Medicine under supervision, and
second, that �further renewal would be limited to a period
of 13 months without
successful completion of the AMC examination or specialist pathway�. Dr Javaid
who was the Director of Medical Imaging at that
time, expressing his concerns and was assured that the conditions were the
step� towards recognition of his qualifications. Dr Javaid stated that
he was satisfied with the response given by Dr Galloway,
believing him to be a
competent source of information in this regard.
or about 12 January 2004 Dr Javaid applied to the Australian Medical Council
for recognition as a specialist in Nuclear Medicine.
This application was
subsequently referred to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of
Radiologists (RANZCR). The RANZCR
did not proceed with the application as Dr
Javaid did not possess the requisite qualifications in Radiology.
Australian Medical Council later
requested that Dr Javaid apply for specialist assessment with the
of Physicians.
This occurred on or about 5 November 2004. The College�s Board of Censors
declined the application for specialist
assessment as Dr Javaid�s training was
not comparable to an Australian trained Physician. However, the Board of
Censors found Dr
Javaid�s training in the area of Nuclear Medicine as
comparable to those of an Australian trained Physician.
Stephen Judd gave evidence on behalf of the
of Physicians
(�the College�). In his statement dated 5 June 2007 Dr Judd stated that Dr
Javaid lacks the �broader training in
Internal Medicine required to practice as
a specialist physician�. It would be a long process to rectify this problem,
Dr Judd stated that Dr Javaid would not be required to repeat his
Nuclear Medicine training as this training was comparable. Dr
Judd stated that
due to the shortfall in his clinical training, no short courses were available
to rectify this. However, it was
stated that �The College supports Dr Javaid�s
continuation in his present role on an ongoing basis as a sub-specialist who is
required to undertake broader clinical practice�. Dr Judd confirmed this at
the hearing, stating that the College only has concerns
to clinically assess patients as he not as trained as other Physicians, and
consequently cannot perform
some of the clinical aspects.
part of further assessment to practice as an area of need specialist, Dr Javaid
was required to undertake 12 months of peer review.
Two �peers� were Fellows of
the Royal College of Physicians and a third was a Fellow of the Royal
Australian College of Radiologists.
Dr Javaid was assessed as �satisfactory�
and deemed adequate for the job on completion of the peer review.
regard to his registration, Dr Javaid gave evidence that as he understood
things, he would only be required to submit an application
with his credentials
and relevant paperwork, and that such forms would then be forwarded to one of
the Colleges for approval. Dr
Javaid stated that he would not have commenced
employment with The Canberra Hospital if he understood that further training
be necessary. He told the Tribunal that he was appointed for his
credentials, qualifications and past experience. As such he did
not believe
that the Hospital thought further training would be necessary when hiring him.
Dr Javaid gave further evidence that
undertaking the required additional
training would not help him to perform his current duties at the Hospital. None
of this evidence
was challenged
was given by Dr Javaid about his interaction with patients at The Canberra
Hospital. Dr Javaid told the Tribunal that he
reports to doctors directly in
order to aid their diagnosis of a patient. Dr Javaid also stated that he has no
role in the actual
treatment of patients; patients are referred to him by a
physician, along with a request form including the patient�s clinical history,
and the current problem along with any specific questions. It is then his job
to identify the proper Nuclear Medicine tests and
imaging procedures, and to
then perform those tests and imaging procedures.
the course of the hearing a duty statement titled �Responsibilities / Job
Description� was tendered as Exhibit 5 and shown
to most witnesses. This
statement purported to be a reflection of the duties Dr Javaid performs at The
Canberra Hospital. Dr Javaid
was asked to identify what duties on that
statement were of a �clinical� nature, of which five duties were identified. These
consultation/advice to clinicians and assisting in meeting diagnostic
providing appropriate assessment of individual
patients imaging requirements;
attending and supervising patients undergoing
nuclear medicine imaging studies;
providing written reports; and
providing an on-call nuclear medicine imaging
Dr Javaid gave
evidence that these five duties take up approximately 90% of his work.
Graham Buirski is the Professor of Medical Imaging at the
and Director of Medical Imaging at the
As such he was, as at August 2008, the supervisor of Dr Javaid in his work at
the hospital. He gave evidence that the five duties
indicated by Dr Javaid
would form about 95% of a qualified Nuclear Medicine Physician�s work. He also
confirmed that the content
of the duty statement was appropriate for Dr
Javaid�s position and the work he performs at the hospital. Graham Buirski
that �without question� he had found Dr Javaid to be a competent
practitioner. Dr Javaid also gave evidence that his competence
has not been
challenged or questioned. In fulfilling these duties, Dr Judd stated that the
duties in Exhibit 5 make up the subset
of duties which a consultant in Nuclear
Medicine would perform.
that Dr Javaid is able to perform the duties in Exhibit 5 quite well, and that
such duties �are certainly within his training�
and capacities.
the hearing Dr Javaid told the Tribunal that he has no interest in practicing
in any other area of medicine. He also stated
that he intends to practice in
retirement, subject to some unforseen circumstance. He gave evidence that he is
willing to work within the confines of the
hospital duty statement. Dr Judd
stated that Dr Javaid�s training in Nuclear Medicine has been very good, and so
long as Exhibit
5 formed the Doctor�s job description there should not be any
safety issues associated with working in the confines of the statement.
Buirski gave evidence that it was �not an easy task� to attract and hire
Nuclear Medicine specialists in
and it was �probably� harder to attract Nuclear Medicine specialists to public
positions. Dr Judd, in his statement tendered as
part of the evidence,
confirmed this point, stating that this was because the private system is more
lucrative. Further Dr Bassett
commented that in September 2007 when undertaking
market testing there was only one qualified applicant although this was not
to make the position an �area of need�. Dr Javaid gave evidence that
at the time of his appointment he was the only suitable applicant,
deemed unsuitable and the other withdrew their application.
Unchallenged
evidence was given by Dr Javaid that, to the best of his knowledge, there are
two private practices in the
region that provide Nuclear Medicine services on an out-patient basis. However
he stated that they �do not really provide any on-call
which is something that he can offer
in his role at The Canberra Hospital. He also drew the Tribunal�s attention to
the difficulties
associated with having to transport some patients to
out-patient clinics should The Canberra Hospital be unable to continue to offer
Nuclear Medicine services.
respondents led evidence about a �succession plan� should Dr Javaid�s
registration not be continued. Graham Buirski gave evidence
that if Dr Javaid
was no longer able to practice at The Canberra Hospital, Dr Ngu and Dr Sullivan
may be able to step in and take
over Dr Javaid�s role. Dr Ngu has been
appointed to the areas of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine at The Canberra
Hospital as a result
of market testing. Dr Buirski gave evidence that he had
not discussed with either Dr Ngu or Dr Sullivan the prospect of them
undertaking
more Nuclear Medicine, although he believes that Dr Ngu would agree
to this. Dr Buirski told the Tribunal that he was also aware
of another person
who may be moving to the region who may be interested in the position. He
stated that he had had no discussions
with the �other person� and at this stage
their interest and availability was based upon �word of mouth�. Neither Dr Ngu
Sullivan were called to give evidence, and as such the evidence of Dr
Buirski in regard to the possibility of those practitioners
taking over the
role currently performed by Dr Javaid remains speculative.
the conclusion of the taking of evidence in the application on 7 August 2008
the Tribunal indicated its view that it was an appropriate
case for conditional
registration of Dr Javaid as a specialist in nuclear medicine. The Tribunal
requested that the parties prepare
a document identifying the duties that Dr
Javaid was performing at The Canberra Hospital with a view to restricting his
practice to those functions he performs at the hospital. Counsel for
the Board raised no objection to that course. Subsequently
the Board apparently
declined to participate in the process we envisaged. The reason proffered by
counsel for the Board for this
decision was the desire of the Board to keep
open its option to appeal the decision of the Tribunal to allow Dr Javaid
conditional
registration.
attitude taking by the Board concerning it�s participation in preparing a list
of functions undertaken by Dr Javaid at The Canberra
hospital is to be
deprecated. Assisting the Tribunal in the way we requested could not prejudice
the Board�s right to test on appeal
the decision to allow conditional
registration. The Board was requested to participate because it was in a better
position than
the Tribunal to protect the public by appropriately investigating
the work undertaken by Dr Javaid at the hospital, so that the
Tribunal could
make appropriate orders. The Board�s failure to assist the Tribunal resulted in
the necessity for the Tribunal to
reconvene on 20 February 2009 and to take
further evidence. The pointlessness of this expensive process was clearly
demonstrated
by the decision of the Board not to cross-examine the witnesses on
their further evidence, and it�s immediate acceptance that the
attached to Dr Sullivan�s affidavit produced at the reconvened hearing
accurately set out the duties being performed by
Dr Javaid at the hospital.
Applicant�s
Submissions
making submissions Ms Walker, on behalf of the applicant, withdrew so much of
the application as was relevant to unfettered
specialist registration. The
application to the Tribunal proceeded solely on the basis that registration be
conditional registration
in the �public interest�. This application was not
made on the basis of filling an area of unmet need under Regulation 117(1)(f),
instead it was made under the wide discretion granted by Regulation 117(2).
written submissions, Ms Walker referred to the balancing act required when
determining issues of �the public interest� (
Sankey v Whitlam
[1978] HCA 43
(1978) 142 CLR 1
McKinnon v Secretary, Department of Treasury
[2006] HCA 45
(2006) 229 ALR 187)
, and the importance of considering the
intention and purpose of the legislation (
v Secretary, Department of Treasury
[2006] HCA 45
(2006) 229 ALR 187).
was submitted that the objective of the Act and the Regulations was the
protection of the public. Ms Walker stated that the
discretion given to the
Tribunal is one which requires it to look at and consider all the circumstances
which cannot be addressed
by legislation.
Walker submitted that there is no evidence that granting Dr Javaid registration
in the public interest would pose a risk to the
public. This was supported by
the fact that Dr Javaid had been performing his current role since October 2003
on conditional registration
provided by the Board. It was also argued that the
Board would not have allowed registration, or allowed it to continue, if any
risk to the public were present. This was also coupled with the applicant�s
successful completion of peer review and the support
shown by the
of Physicians to
the continuation of his current role. Further, the evidence showed that Dr
Javaid was highly qualified for the
position he holds. As such it was submitted
that the granting of registration would not cause any harm or danger to the
was further submitted that Dr Javaid practices in a very specialised area of
medicine; a sub-speciality of both Radiology and
Adult Medicine. It was
submitted that this was highlighted by the fact that Dr Javaid was the only
suitable applicant at the time
of his employment. It was put to the Tribunal
that although Dr Ngu may possess �better� qualifications, meaning that his
qualifications
met requirements for registration in the
Australian Capital Territory
, they were
actually wider qualifications and it did not follow that he, nor any other
applicant, would be as qualified in the sub-speciality
of Nuclear Medicine.
Walker submitted that should conditional registration be granted, it would be
easier to police Dr Javaid than it would other
practitioners to ensure he is
acting within the ambit of conditions imposed upon him. She submitted that it
would simply require
making enquiries with those who supervise him at the
hospital to ensure first that he is still employed there, and second whether
any of the doctor�s duties have changed.
was submitted that Dr Javaid provides an important service to residents of the
Australian Capital Territory
in a speciality where there is a clear shortage of practitioners. Requiring Dr
Javaid to complete the AMC pathway is not practical.
It will not make him a
better specialist in Nuclear Medicine, or in any way assist him in his present
role. Dr Javaid was not just
an opportunist, he had no intention to try and
work around the registration system. He simply falls through the cracks.
Respondent�s
Submissions
Mr Archer argued for the respondents that in
order to rely on the public interest, such interest must be both identified and
substantiated
by evidence. It was argued that the public interest relied upon
by the applicant was amorphous, lacked identification, and must
be considered
separate from the applicant�s private interests. He submitted that Dr Javaid
does not fall within the matters specifically
provided for in Regulation 117, a
point conceded by the applicant, arguing that the applicants submissions were
akin to a de-facto
area of need argument.
Archer submitted that the public interest is a matter that must be �determined
in context, and particularly in the context of
the relevant legislation�. He
argued that the issue of public safety is an underlying feature of the
registration system: see section
13 of the Act. The process of registration provided
for in the Act ensures that medical practitioners possess qualifications to
particular standard, wherever they have been trained. This ensures the public
safety. The fact that the Board had already restricted
Dr Javaid�s practice of
medicine by the imposition of conditional registration shows the Board�s
concerns, and the evidence of
Dr Judd highlighted significant problems with his
training, particularly with regard to the exercise of clinical judgements and
Dr Javaid�s capacity in general clinical matters.
was put to the Tribunal that placing a condition that Dr Javaid practice within
the ambit of a duty statement, such as that in
Exhibit 5, would put the Board
in the situation where they cannot be satisfied that there is compliance. The
Tribunal�s attention
was drawn to Dr Javaid�s initial reluctance to practice
under supervision. Placing a requirement on the Board requiring it to police
Javaid would be quite arduous. In addition to this, the characterisation of
�clinical� and �non-clinical� duties for the purpose
of this statement would be
a significant issue.
Archer also submitted that employment should not cause registration, but
registration should cause employment. In short, the
requirements of the
legislative scheme are not satisfied by the applicant, even though he has
stable employment. It was submitted
that it should not be for the Tribunal to
correct such a situation regardless of Dr Javaid�s competency in performing his
under conditional registration as previously provided. The fact that he
has performed the position on the basis of an area of unmet
need should not
result in exemption from the suitability to practice requirements, particularly
when the designation no longer
applies to the situation.
Further, the lack of diligence on behalf of Dr
Javaid in ensuring he met the requirements of the legislative scheme should not
rewarded by registration. This process should not become a back door to
registration, especially when the Board had been urging
the applicant to remedy
the situation for almost five years. It was argued that public interest is best
served when appropriately
qualified practitioners, as required by the
legislation, are employed to fill medical vacancies.
Tribunal has been asked to conditionally register Dr Javaid on the basis that
it is in the public interest. It has been asked
to consider such registration
on the basis of the broad discretion provided by Regulation 117. Submissions
were made by both parties
concerning the public safety element of this
consideration, which is of paramount importance. The Tribunal agrees with this
submission,
and is of the view that this is reflected in the system of
registration envisaged by both the Act and the Regulations, as expressly
in Regulation 116(1)(b).
116 of the Regulation requires that before allowing conditional registration
the Tribunal must be satisfied of two things.
First, it must be in the public
interest to conditionally register the person. Secondly, the Tribunal must be
satisfied that conditional
registration will not endanger the public. Taking
the second of those considerations first, the Tribunal was told that Dr
qualifications were lacking with regard to the �broader training in
Internal Medicine required to practice as a specialist physician�.
Javaid�s qualifications and training are not sufficient to enable him to obtain
unconditional registration. However, the
evidence of Dr Judd did show that Dr
Javaid�s qualifications were sufficient to enable him to continue to perform
his current role
without any suggestion of danger to the public.
Javaid has been employed in his current position with The Canberra Hospital
since October 2003. All the evidence put to the Tribunal
pointed to Dr Javaid being
highly qualified and competent to perform his duties, with evidence to this
effect was given by both
his colleague, Dr Graham Buirski, and Doctor Judd, a
former member of the Royal College of Physicians Board of Censors. It is evident
from his successful completion of peer review, and from the Board�s decision to
continually register Dr Javaid for such a length
of time, albeit with
conditions, that there have not been any real concerns about any risk to the
public presented by Dr Javaid
undertaking his present duties at the hospital.
now turn to the question of the public interest. While it has been made clear
by Dr Javaid that he is not pursuing conditional
registration on the basis that
the position is in an area of unmet need, it is still important to note that
Nuclear Medicine is
a very specialised and not overly populated sub-speciality
of medicine. It is clear on the evidence that Nuclear Medicine is an
there are practitioner shortages, with difficulties recruiting medical practitioners
particularly to public positions.
While the respondent did attempt to lead
evidence to show that this was not the case, and that people may be available
over the role of Dr Javaid at The Canberra Hospital, it is difficult to
accept this evidence as anything more than speculation.
The simple fact is that
Dr Javaid is a well qualified and respected practitioner in a narrow
sub-speciality, being an area of medical
practice in which there are
practitioner shortages. In addition he provides an on-call service not
replicated in the private system.
The public interest, or benefit, in having
such a well qualified and experienced practitioner available to provide
services to
the public in the ACT is obvious.
respondents argued against the use of conditional registration, submitting that
to do so will place an arduous obligation upon
the Board. The Board�s concern
was based upon the continual requirement to determine whether Dr Javaid is
performing his duties
in accordance with the conditions imposed on his
practice. However, this �burden� is present whenever conditional registration
is granted to any medical practitioner. Even when registration has no
conditions attached there may still be questions whether a
practitioner is
acting within the bounds of their speciality. Dr Javaid is still subject to
supervision at the hospital by his
superiors, and it would not be unreasonable
for the Board to make enquiries with such persons, or to seek to inspect
hospital records.
is no suggestion that Dr Javaid deliberately attempted to avoid the
registration process when he accepted the job from The
Canberra Hospital. We
acknowledge the legitimate concerns of the respondent that serial conditional
registration not be used as
an alternative mechanism for specialist
registration. However we do not see this case as creating any precedent
supporting such
an approach to registration. In our view the facts of this
matter are quite unique, and are not likely to reoccur.
We recognise, of course, that conditional registration
is for a period not exceeding 12 months, and that Dr Javaid will be required
re-apply for registration every 12 months. For our part, subject to a change in
circumstances, we can see no reason why that
registration could not be dealt
with expeditiously and renewed on the same conditions we have imposed. However,
that is a matter
for the Board.
Tribunal orders that the applicant be registered as a specialist in nuclear
medicine for the period of 27 March 2009 until 26
March 2010 subject to the
following conditions:
that he practices nuclear medicine for diagnostic
that he practices nuclear medicine for therapeutic
purposes on referral from another medical practitioner with whom there is
an agreed treatment regime;
that he practice only in the course of his
employment at The Canberra Hospital;
that he advise the Medical Board of any intended
change of employment prior to commencing such employment;
that he provide such information to the Medical
Board concerning his practice as required in writing by the Board;
that he provide to the Medical Board a signed
statement from his supervisor at The Canberra Hospital attesting to his
compliance with conditions one to three inclusive within 7 days before
the expiration of this registration.
