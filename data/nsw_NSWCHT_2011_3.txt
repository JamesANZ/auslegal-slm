sections 163B of the

(National Law) by Mr Michael Epstein (Applicant).
Applicant wrote to the Chiropractic Council of New South Wales (Council) on 3
June 2011 requesting that the Condition placed upon
his Registration preventing
him from using the prefix ’Dr’ in connection with his practice as a
chiropractor be lifted.
This, in effect, is an application to review the Order
previously made by the Chiropractors and Osteopaths Board of NSW (Board).

Standards Committee (PSC) established under section
Chiropractors
and Osteopaths Act 1991
1991 Act) on 22
December 1998.
Council referred the Application to the Tribunal on 28 July 2011. At the
Directions Hearing held on 24 August 2011 the matter
was listed for Inquiry on
15 November 2011.
the Inquiry the Applicant appeared by way of teleconference from Indonesia and
the Council was represented by the Legal Director.
Comprehensive written
submissions were provided on behalf of the Council which assisted the Tribunal
and were accepted by the Applicant.
The powers of the
relevant power is set out in section 163B(1)(d) of the National Law as follows:
(d) make an order altering or removing the conditions to which
the person’s registration is subject, including by imposing
conditions.
nature of the review conducted by the Tribunal and matters to be considered are
set out in section 163C of the National Law which
(1) A review under this Division is a review to determine the
appropriateness, at the time of the review, of the order concerned.
(2) The review is not to review the decision to make the order, or
any findings made in connection with the making of that decision.
(3) In addition to any other matter the review may take into
account, the review must take into account any complaint made or notified
Council or a National Board, or a former Board under a repealed Act, about the
person, whether the complaint was made or notified
before or after the making of
the order that is the subject of the review and whether or not the complaint was
referred under Subdivision
2 of Division 3 or any other action was taken on the
Findings of the Professional Standards Committee (PSC)
PSC found the Applicant guilty of professional misconduct (as defined in section
3 of the 1991 Act) “
in that he used the prefix “Dr”, and
the title “Doctor”, in breach of
section 5(4)
Chiropractors
and Osteopaths Act 1991
PSC exercised its protective functions under section 39(1)(c) of the 1991 Act
and ordered that a condition be placed on the Applicant’s
registration as
That Mr Epstein not use the prefix “Dr” at any time in
connection with his practice as a chiropractor, or any clinic in
which he is
PSC also fined the Applicant the sum of $1,100 in accordance with section
39(1)(g) of the 1991 Act.
Submissions made by the
Council submitted that the public interest was not served by the continuation of
the Order of the PSC and that the Tribunal would
find that the Order was no
longer appropriate. By way of background to the matter the Councils submissions
included the following
(at paragraphs 15 and 16 of the written
submission):
operation of transitional provisions in the
Chiropractors Act 2001
(the 2001 Act) and the 2010 Law Mr Epstein is a registered chiropractor under
the provisions of the 2010 Law and the condition imposed
on his registration
under the 1991 Act is a condition on his registration under the 2010 Law.
Council understands that Mr Epstein’s general registration as a
chiropractor lapsed in June 2011. Mr Epstein applied to
be re-registered in the
non-practising category of registration in September 2011 and due to an
administrative oversight at Australian
Health Practitioner Regulation Agency
(AHPRA) the condition on his general registration was not applied to his
non-practising registration.
Consequently the register of practitioners kept by
AHPRA does not display that condition and shows that Mr Epstein’s
registration
is not subject to conditions. The administrative error by AHPRA
does not however undermine the operation of the statutory provisions
Epstein’s registration as a chiropractor remains subject to the condition
imposed in 1998.
Legislative
developments
Council submissions summarised the relevant legislative developments that have
occurred since the condition was placed on the
Applicant’s registration in
paragraphs 17 to 20 as follows:
1 August 2002 the 2001 Act
[Chiropractors Act 2001]
commenced. By
operation of clause 7 of Schedule 7 to the 2001 Act Mr Epstein became a
registered chiropractor under that Act and
by operation of clause 13 of Schedule
7 to the 2001 Act the condition imposed on Mr Epstein’s registration
became an order
under section 51(1)(d) of that Act and continued to have effect.
addition section 18 of the 2001 Act expressly provided that a registered
chiropractor may not use the title “Doctor”
in the course of
practising chiropractic. The section
Use of titles
(1) A registered chiropractor must not use the title
“doctor” in the course of the practice of chiropractic unless the
chiropractor is the holder of a qualification conferred by a university that
entitles the chiropractor to use that title and that
qualification is a
recognised qualification at the time the chiropractor uses the title.
Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units.
(2) In this section:
recognised qualification
(a) a qualification that is prescribed by the regulations as a
recognised qualification, or
(b) when no qualification is prescribed under paragraph (a), a
qualification that is for the time being recognised by the Board for
purposes of this section.
At no time was any qualification held by Mr Epstein a qualification that
could be recognised for the purposes of section 18 of the
1 July 2010 the 2010 Law came into operation and the 2001 Act was repealed. By
operation of section 269 of the 2010 Law Mr Epstein
became registered as a
chiropractor under that Law. By operation of section 292 of the 2010 Law the
order on Mr Epstein’s
registration became an order under that Law and
continued to have effect.
2010 Law does not prevent chiropractors (or in fact any other practitioner) from
adopting the title “Doctor” or variants
on it. In fact each of the
chiropractor members of the Chiropractic Board of Australia, established under
section 31 of the 2010
Law, and each of the practitioner members of the
Chiropractic Council of New South Wales, established under section 41B of the
Law, lawfully uses the honorific title

they were not serious matters nor were they relevant
to the issue before the
