Workers' Compensation (S.A.) - Permanent and total incapacity - Redemption
of employer's liability for weekly payments - Amendments
to legislation after
date of injury increasing rates of weekly payments - Computation of amount
payable for redemption - Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1932-1966 (S.A.), ss. 18,
1972, January 24-27; March 28. 28:3:1972
APPEAL from the High Court of Australia.
LORD PEARSON delivered the judgment of their Lordships as follows:-
The present appellant, Maria Staska, has been substituted for the deceased
respondents, and on 21st May 1956 while carrying a heavy
weight he suffered a
low back strain. This was a personal injury by accident arising out of and in
the course of his employment.
From time to time it caused incapacity and he
received from the respondents weekly payments as compensation under the
Workmen's Compensation
Act, 1932 (S.A.). He was given clerical work from 13th
January 1962 onwards but on 13th November 1966 he had to cease work again.
returned to work with a lumbo-sacral support on 13th January 1967, but was
forced by back pain to give up work again on 7th February
1967. From then
onwards he was totally and permanently incapacitated, and he received from the
respondents weekly payments as compensation
on that basis. (at p674)
2. The respondents on 27th March 1968 applied for an arbitration for the
redemption of their liability to make weekly payments to
the workman. The
workman did not file an answer and at the hearing supported the application.
But a dispute arose with regard to
the basis for assessment of the redemption
price. There are statutory provisions limiting the employer's total liability
of weekly payments. Naturally this figure of total liability is
taken as the basis for the assessment of the redemption price, some
being made for acceleration of payment and other matters. But which is the
relevant figure of total liability? Is it the
figure of 2,600 pounds for which
the Act provided at the time of the injury in 1956? Or is it the figure of
6,000 pounds introduced
by an amending Act of 1965? There were intermediate
figures introduced by other amending Acts between 1956 and 1965, but the
respondents
have contended for the figure of 2,600 pounds and the workman and
the present appellant have contended for the figure of 6,000 pounds,
neither side has contended for any other figure as being the relevant figure
of total liability to form the basis for the assessment
of the redemption
price. (at p675)
3. That is the question in this appeal, and the answer to it must be found in
the relevant statutory provisions, which are contained
in the Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1932-1963, the Workmen's Compensation Amendment Act, 1965
and the Workmen's Compensation Amendment
Act, 1966. There are two general
considerations affecting the construction of these provisions, and the
statutory history must be
taken into account.
(1) There is a prima facie presumption or canon of construction that an
enactment is not intended to affect rights which have already
been acquired or
liabilities which have already been incurred before the enactment has come
into operation. This is sometimes spoken
of as a presumption against
retrospective operation of a statute, but this use of the word
"retrospective", though it may be convenient
as a label, is not accurate as a
description of an enactment which interferes only with the future existence or
operation of a previously
acquired right or a previously incurred liability. A
truly retrospective enactment would be one, such as an Indemnity Act, making
lawful a past action which was unlawful when committed, or one making unlawful
a past action which was lawful when committed: West

pp 11, 12, per Cozens-Hardy M.R. and Buckley L.J. Kennedy L.J. referred (1911)
2 Ch, at p 16 to the Latin
maxim "Nova constitutio
futuris formam imponere
debet, non praeteritis", but that is only a broad statement of the principle.
presumption was given statutory
force in South Australia by s. 16 (1) of
the Acts Interpretation Act, 1915-1936, providing that:
"Where any Act, whenever passed, repeals or has repealed a
former Act or any provision or words thereof, or where any Act
or enactment, whenever passed, expired or has expired, then,
unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal or expiry shall
III. affect any right, interest, title, power or privilege created,
acquired, accrued, established or exercisable . . . prior to
such repeal or expiry : or
IV. affect any duty, obligation, liability, or burden of proof
imposed, created, or incurred . . . prior to such repeal or
The presumption has been recognized and applied in the sphere of workmen's
compensation legislation in a number of cases both in the
United Kingdom and
in Australia : United Collieries Ltd. v. Simpson, per Lord Macnaghten
, at p 393; King v. Port of
London Authority

Blackwell Colliery Co. Ltd.

, at pp 193-195, 202; The
presumption, however, is only a
prima facie presumption. The Acts
Interpretation
has the words "unless the contrary intention
appears". In some cases
a contrary intention has been found in statutory
relating to workmen's compensation: Hall v. Metropolitan Abattoirs
(1945) SASR 193
; Sunshine Porcelain Potteries
Pty. Ltd. v. Nash
[1961] UKPCHCA 2
(1961) 104 CLR 639
In Fisher v. Hebburn
Ltd. Fullagar J. said (1960)
105 CLR, at p 194:
"There can be no doubt that the general rule is that an amending
enactment - or, for that matter, any enactment - is prima facie to
be construed as having a prospective operation only. That is to
say, it is prima facie to be construed as not attaching new legal
consequences to facts or events which occurred before its
commencement. The rule has been frequently applied to amending
statutes relating to workers' compensation, and it has often been
held that such amendments apply only in respect of 'accidents' or
'injuries' occurring after their coming into force : the cases of
Moakes v. Blackwell Colliery Co. Ltd.
(1925) 2 KB 64
and Kraljevich
v. Lake View and Star Ltd.
[1945] HCA 29
(1945) 70 CLR 647
are familiar
examples. But there is no rule of law that such statutes must be so
construed, and it would not be true to say that a retrospective
effect can only be avoided by confining the operation of such a
statute to subsequently occurring 'accidents' or 'injuries'. It may
truly be said to operate prospectively only, although its prospect
begins so to speak, with some other event than accident or injury.
This is, I think, the case here. I think the prospect of sub-s.
(2A) begins with incapacity and not with injury." (at p677)
4. (2) Inflation has created awkward problems in the sphere of workmen's
compensation as well as in many other spheres. On the one
hand, if the scale
of compensation remains fixed as it was at the time of the injury, the
compensation will become less and less
adequate for the maintenance of the
workman and his family. On the other hand, if the compensation is increased
from time to time
to keep pace with the diminishing real value of money, the
calculations of the financial risks to be insured against, which were
when the premiums were settled in years long past, must be falsified. This may
be offset to some extent by increasing monetary
value of investments but
probably not entirely. The accounting difficulty was referred to by Lord Shaw
of Dunfermline in Clement
v. D. Davis and Sons Ltd. He said (1927) AC, at pp
"If the appellant's view were correct, it is clear that the
financial results of accidents would be so far and, it might be,
seriously altered. The business advantage and sound principle
of accounting, of being able to understand the scope and, so far
as may be, the extent of liability dependent on past occurrences,
and to frame accounts and estimates accordingly, would be pro
legislation. The presumption against that is well known and
approved. That presumption may of course be overridden by
express statutory provision". (at p677)
5. Having regard to the obvious difficulties caused by inflation, one would
not be surprised to find legislation containing from
time to time anomalies or
discrepancies attributable to political compromise or "tempering the wind to
the shorn lamb". (at p677)
6. The previous statutory history is important, because legislative patterns
had been developed. (at p677)
7. In 1947 there was a Workmen's Compensation Amendment Act. Section 1 (2)
and (3) and s. 2 were as follows :
"(2) The Workmen's Compensation Act, 1932-1944, as amended by
this Act, may be cited as the 'Workmen's Compensation Act,
1932-1947'.
(3) The Workmen's Compensation Act, 1932-1944, is hereinafter
called 'the principal Act'.
2. This Act is incorporated with the principal Act and that
Act and this Act shall be read as one Act." (at p677)
8. Sections 4-11 contained amendments increasing the amounts of compensation.
In particular s. 6 amended s. 18 of the principal
Act so as to increase the
amounts payable for incapacity, the total liability of the employer under this
section being increased
from 800 pounds to 1,150 pounds. (at p678)
9. Section 13 provided that :
"Sections 4 to 11 inclusive of this Act shall apply only in
relation to injury or death caused by an accident occurring
after the commencement of this Act. Where injury or death
was caused by an accident occurring before the commencement
of this Act, the provisions of the principal Act, as in force
immediately before the passing of this Act, shall apply." (at p678)
10. The Workmen's Compensation Amendment Act, 1950, did not contain any
saving clause similar to section 13 of the 1947 Act. (at
11. The Workmen's Compensation Amendment Act, 1951, contained in ss. 1 and 2
provisions similar to those of the corresponding provisions
of the Act of
1947. Sections 3 to 8 contained provisions increasing amounts of compensation,
and in particular s. 18 raised the employer's
total liability under that
section from 1,150 pounds to 1,750 Pounds. Section 9 contained provisions
similar to those of s. 13 of
the Act of 1947 with the addition of a proviso as
"Provided that where a workman is at the time of the
commencement of this Act in receipt of or entitled to a weekly
payment for total or partial incapacity resulting from injury
caused by an accident before the said commencement, such
weekly payment shall, on and after the said commencement, be
at the rate which would be payable if this Act had been in force
when the accident occurred ; but the total liability of the
employer in respect of weekly payments for any such incapacity
shall not exceed one thousand one hundred and fifty pounds." (at p678)
12. This section is interesting in two respects. (1) It follows s. 13 of the
Act of 1947 in providing that the general rule is for
compensation to be at
the rate provided by the Act which was in force when the accident occurred,
but it modifies the operation of
the general rule by an "as if" provision. (2)
There is an obvious compromise, creating a discrepancy, in respect of the
total liability
: it is not brought up to the current figure of 1,750 pounds,
but it is brought up from the figure in force at the date of the accident
the figure of 1,150 pounds, which was in force under the preceding Act : it is
therefore not in step with the provisions relating
to the weekly payments. (at
13. The Workmen's Compensation Amendment Act, 1953, was on the same lines as
the Act of 1951, including in its saving clause a similar
proviso. The figure
of total liability in s. 18 of the principal Act was raised from 1,750 pounds
to 2,250 pounds, but the figure
in the saving clause (s. 10 of the Act of
1953) was only 1,750 pounds. (at p678)
14. There were Acts of 1954 and 1955 containing similar provisions. These
Acts raised the total liability under s. 18 of the principal
Act from 2,250
pounds to 2,500 pounds and from 2,500 pounds to 2,600 Pounds. 001 The saving
clauses did not have a proviso : they
were similar to the saving clause in the
Act of 1947 with small differences of wording which seem not material for the
present purpose.
15. The figure of 2,600 pounds for total liability under s. 18 was the figure
in force in 1956 when the deceased workman, Jan Staska,
suffered his accident.
16. There were Workmen's Compensation Amendment Acts of 1956, 1958, 1960 and
1961, containing saving clauses substantially similar
to the saving clause in
the Act of 1955. The Workmen's Compensation Act Amendment Act, 1963, had a
different saving clause :
"Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 and the amendments made by
paragraphs (a) and (c) of section 8 of this Act shall apply only in
relation to injury or death caused by an accident occurring after
the commencement of this Act. In cases of injury or death
caused by an accident occurring before the commencement of
this Act the provisions of the principal Act as in force
immediately before the commencement of this Act as amended
by paragraph (b) of section 8 shall apply but not so as to affect
any case in which the amount of compensation has been
settled and paid prior to such commencement." (at p679)
17. The Workmen's Compensation Act, 1932-1963, as reprinted pursuant to the
Amendments Incorporation Act, 1937, and incorporating
all amendments made
prior to 1st June 1964, had to deal with the long series of savings clause
incorporated in whatever was the principal
Act from time to time because each
amending Act was incorporated with the principal Act and the principal Act and
the amending Act
were to be read as one Act. The saving clauses, so far as
they related to s. 18, were dealt with in a massive footnote, which shows
complexity of the situation which had arisen :
"The amendments made to this section by section 6 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act Amendment Act, 1947, by
section 6 of the" (Act of 1951) "by section 7 of the" (Act of
1953) "by section 5 of the" (Act of 1954) "by section 7 of the"
(Act of 1955) "by section 5 of the" (Act of 1958) "by section
6 of the" (Act of 1960) "by section 5 of the" (Act of 1961)
"and by section 7 of the" (Act of 1963) "apply only in relation
to injury or death caused by an accident occurring, respectively,
after 11th December 1947, 25th October 1951, 17th December
1953, 23rd December 1954, 8th December 1955, 27th November
1958, 19th May 1960, 16th November 1961 and 28th November
1963. See section 13 of the 1947 Act, section 9 of the 1951
Act, section 10 of the 1953 Act, section 10 of the 1954 Act,
section 10 of the 1955 Act, section 8 of the 1958 Act, section 10
of the 1960 Act, section 9 of the 1961 Act and section 11 of the
1963 Act." (at p680)
18. Evidently there were many different levels of compensation depending on
the dates at which the accidents had occurred. Up to
this point of time the
basic assumption, in agreement with the presumption referred to above, was
that the rates and amounts of compensation
provided by the legislation in
force at the time of the accident would continue to apply to the consequences
of the accident unless
later legislation otherwise provided. (at p680)
19. In construing the crucial provisions of the Act of 1965 (the Workmen's
Compensation Amendment Act, 1965) it is necessary to
bear in mind the previous
statutory history and the resulting situation in relation to which the Act of
1965 was passed. (at p680)
20. The Act of 1965 was amending the principal Act which was then the
1932-1963 Act. In the principal Act s. 16 provided compensation
for dependants
on the death of a workman in consequence of a compensable injury ; s. 18
provided compensation by weekly payments
in respect of incapacity resulting
from a compensable injury, and by sub-s. (3) limited the employer's total
liability for such compensation
; and s. 26 provided fixed sums of
compensation for certain injuries. Under s. 16 the maximum compensation for
dependants was 3,250
pounds plus 110 pounds for each dependent child ; under
s. 18 (3) the employer's total liability in respect of payments under that
section was 3,500 pounds; and under s. 26 the workman could not receive fixed
sums in excess of 3,500 pounds. Section 5 of the Act
of 1965 amended s. 16 of
the principal Act by substituting 6,000 pounds for 3,500 pounds; s. 6 (b) of
the Act of 1965 amended s.
18 (3) of the principal Act by substituting 6,000
pounds for 3,500 pounds; s. 8 of the Act of 1965 amended s. 26 (5) of the
Act by substituting 4,500 pounds for 3,500 pounds. (at p680)
21. Bearing in mind the presumption which has been mentioned, the previous
statutory history and the complex situation existing
immediately before the
Act of 1965, one would not expect these changes to apply to compensation for
past accidents. That would have
been a revolutionary innovation requiring
express words or very clear implication to bring it about. (at p680)
22. There is no saving clause of any of the patterns to be found in the
previous legislation, but there is instead of a saving clause
a new section
making a tentative and partial modification of the previous system. The new
section (s. 28a of the principal Act, inserted
by s. 9 of the Act of 1965) is
as follows :
"28a. Notwithstanding anything in this or any other Act
contained, where -
(a) compensation has been paid to a workman pursuant to
(b) the workman has returned to work and,
(c) the workman subsequent to his return to work dies or
suffers incapacity as a result of the injury in respect of
which the compensation was paid,
the amount of compensation payable in respect of the death of the
workman shall be computed and based upon the amount of compensation
payable under this Act at the time of the death of the workman or,
as the case may require, the amount of weekly compensation payable
in respect of the subsequent incapacity shall be computed and based
upon the rates of weekly compensation payable at the time of the
subsequent incapacity. Provided however that this section shall
not apply where compensation has been paid to the workman in
respect of the injury pursuant to section 26 of this Act." (at p681)
23. This new s. 28a effects a partial innovation, a limited modification of
the previous system, applicable only to the special
class of workmen, namely
those who had been injured, had returned to work and then had been
incapacitated or had died as a result
of the injury. They were to have the
benefit of the current rates of weekly payments for incapacity, or their
dependants were to
have the benefit of current rates of compensation for death
resulting from the injury. The implication must be that the previous
involving a distinction between compensation for past injuries and
compensation for future injuries, was not being swept
away but was being
retained subject only to the limited exception introduced by s. 28a. If the
previous system was being wholly swept
away, s. 28a would be unnecessary and
meaningless. Any argument to the effect that by implication the previous
system was being wholly
swept away must be rejected. (at p681)
24. The other argument for the appellant is that under s. 28a the total
liability for weekly payments is increased for any workman
to whom s. 28a
applies. Undoubtedly s. 28a did apply to Jan Staska because he was injured, he
did return to work and he was afterwards
incapacitated as a result of the
injury. Does s. 28a increase the total liability under s. 18 of the principal
Act ? In support of
the argument that it does, reliance was placed upon the
decision and reasoning of the High Court of Australia in the case of Wattle
Gully Mines v. Clementi
[1956] HCA 16
(1956) 94 CLR 353
, especially the passage where it was
said (1956) 94 CLR, at p 363:
"But however this may be, the provisions of the principal Act
which relate to 'rates' of compensation must comprise the
whole of the provisions of that Act which, in a case for which
weekly payments are provided, regulate the extent of the
employer's liability to make such payments. The rate of
payments in such a case is not fully or accurately described by
saying that it is so much a week : it is so much a week subject
to the statutory limit upon the total amount to be paid."
But that was said in relation to an Act which referred to "rates or amounts of
compensation", and that phrase might well include the
total liability. In the
present case s.28a provides that :
" . . . the amount of weekly compensation payable in respect
of the subsequent incapacity shall be computed and based upon
the rates of weekly compensation payable at the time of the
subsequent incapacity."
In their Lordships' opinion, the specification of the weekly character of the
compensation referred to should have its due effect
and should be understood
as excluding the total liability. The appellant does not succeed under the Act
of 1965. (at p682)
25. There remains to be considered the Act of 1966. This introduced a new s.
28a as follows :
"28(a). Notwithstanding anything in this or any other Act
contained, the amount of compensation payable in respect of the
death of a workman after the commencement of the Workmen's
Compensation Act Amendment Act 1966, shall be the amount of
compensation payable under this Act at the time of the death of the
workman whether the injury resulting in the death occurred before
or after such commencement and the amount of the weekly payment of
compensation payable to a workman for total or partial incapacity
pursuant to this Part after the said commencement shall be the
weekly rates of compensation in force from time to time,
irrespective of when the injury occurred : Provided that this
section shall not apply where compensation has been paid to the
workman in respect of the injury pursuant to section 26 or section
28 of this Act nor shall it apply to the total liability of an
employer under sub-section (3) of section 18 of this Act." (at p682)
26. This section brought about a very extensive modification of the previous
system. It abolished the distinction between compensation
for past injuries
and compensation for future injuries, so far as concerned (1) compensation to
dependants for death of the workman
(2) the amount of the weekly payment for
incapacity. But in their Lordship's opinion the amount of the total liability
(3) remained unaffected because (a) the substantive provisions of
s. 28a refer only to the amount of the weekly payment (the weekly
payment) and not to the total liability, (b) the proviso was intended to make
it plain that the amount of the total liability
was to remain unaffected by
this section, and (c) the framework of earlier legislation shows that there is
no invariable correlation
between the amount of the weekly payment and the
amount of the total liability (the one being often changed without, or
differently
from, the other). (at p683)
27. Accordingly the total liability which is to be taken as the basis for
redemption is 2,600 pounds ($5,200) and not 6,000 pounds
($12,000). (at p683)
For the reasons which have been stated their Lordships will humbly advise
Her Majesty that the decision of the majority of the High
Court of Australia
[1969] HCA 13
(1969) 119 CLR 301
should be affirmed and the appeal should be dismissed. The
appellant must pay
the respondents'
costs of the appeal.
