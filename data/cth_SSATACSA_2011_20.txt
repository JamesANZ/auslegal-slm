Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review. This means the application
for review is not successful.
DATE OF DESPATCH
August 2011
STATEMENT OF
Alfred and Ms Alfred separated in 2010. Mr Alfred has since been assessed as
liable to pay child support to Ms Alfred.
the child support assessment began in 2011, neither parent had lodged their
2009/2010 income tax return. So the Child Support
Agency used provisional
figures in assessing the rate of child support. For Ms Alfred it used an income
figure of $105,428, but this
was soon replaced with the figure of $72,000. This
figure was declared by Ms Alfred for her 2009/2010 adjusted taxable income, in
the absence of a completed tax return and tax assessment.
25 February 2011 Ms Alfred lodged a current income estimate. She advised that
her year to date income (for the period 1 July 2010
to 24 February 2011) was
$38,320. She estimated that she would have income of $20,180.69 in the remainder
of the 2010/2011 tax year.
These figures were based on wages of $4,875 per
month. Annualised, the income for the remainder of the tax year was
Child Support Agency accepted the estimate, and used the income figure of
$58,459 in assessing the rate of child support in the
period 25 February 2011 to
30 June 2011.
Alfred objected to the decision to accept the estimate, but on 3 June 2011 an
Objections Officer disallowed the objection. Mr Alfred
then applied to the
Tribunal for a review on 5 July 2011.
June 2011 Ms Alfred lodged her 2009/2010 tax return. Her adjusted taxable income
for 2009/2010 turned out to be $84,204.
INFORMATION
Tribunal has taken into account the sworn oral evidence given and the
submissions made at the hearing by Mr Alfred and Ms Alfred,
as well as the

statement and documents prepared by the Child Support Agency;
A: document
supplied by Mr Alfred; and
B: documents
supplied by Ms Alfred.
LEGISLATIVE
relevant legislation is the
Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989
Act’). Under
section 60(1)
, a parent may lodge an estimate of current
income if the annualised estimate would be not more than 85% of:
parent’s adjusted taxable income in the last relevant year of income;
the amount that
the parent declares is their adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year
of income, and the Child Support Registrar
is satisfied that the declared amount
is correct.
at 25 February 2011, the last relevant year of income was 2009/2010.
section 60(3)
and (4), the parent must advise their year-to-date income for the
tax year, and estimate their income for the balance of the tax
estimate is then annualised.
section 63AA
, the Child Support Registrar (or the Tribunal in the
Registrar’s place) may refuse to accept the estimate if the year-to-date
income is too high, or the estimated future income is too low.
in this context means ‘adjusted taxable income’, which consists of
the person’s taxable income,
reportable fringe benefits, target foreign
income, net investment loss, tax free pensions and benefits, and reportable

is common ground that Ms Alfred’s rate of employment income was lower as
at February 2011 than it had been, overall, in 2009/2010.
Ms Alfred had reduced
her workload from five days per week to three in January 2010.
Information
is now available that was not available in February 2011. Ms Alfred’s
2009/2010 income tax return has been lodged.
She has received her 2010/2011 PAYG
payment summary. Although Ms Alfred’s 2010/2011 income tax return has not
yet been prepared,
it is now common ground that the $58,459 estimate was too
PAYG payment summary shows that Ms Alfred earned assessable income of $48,167
(including a mileage allowance) in 2010/2011. She
also had a reportable fringe
benefit amount of $17,000 arising from a salary sacrifice arrangement. Ms Alfred
does not know the exact
amount of the other components of her income, partly
because Mr Alfred has possession of most of the share details. However, Ms
told the Tribunal that she expects the non-wage 2010/2011 income
components will probably be in the vicinity of the 2009/2010 figures.
basis, in 2010/2011 Ms Alfred is likely to have, approximately:
interest income
dividend income
of $3,314; and
an investment
(rental property) loss of $9,484.
Alfred told the Tribunal she has a small business she operates as a hobby. She
does not anticipate that the small profit she may
have made from those sales
will form part of her taxable income. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt
Alfred told the Tribunal she expects her 2010/2011 deductions to be lower than
her 2009/2010 deductions. The Tribunal will adopt
a mid-point between her
2008/2009 and 2009/2010 deductions, namely $1,714.
the above basis, Ms Alfred’s 2010/2011 taxable income is likely to be in
the vicinity of $41,276. With the addition of the
investment loss and the
reportable fringe benefit, her adjusted taxable income in 2010/2011 is likely to
be in the vicinity of $67,760.
Ms Alfred earned her income at a constant rate across the tax year in 2010/2011,
it is not necessary for present purposes to break
the figure down into pre- and
post-25 February 2011 components. Suffice it to say that the income figure that
Ms Alfred gave for
the period 25 February 2011 to 30 June 2011, should (to be
accurate) have been in the vicinity of $67,760 when annualised. This figure
less than 85% of Ms Alfred’s actual 2009/2010 adjusted taxable income of
Alfred told the Tribunal of a number of problems she had experienced in
providing an estimate. One was a lack of information. She
did not have her
2009/2010 income tax return as a guide, as she was unable to finalise the return
due to circumstances beyond her
control. Another problem was conflicting advice
from the Child Support Agency on different occasions. Another problem was that
expected her gross wages and the fringe benefit amount to add up to the
annual salary figure shown on her payslips, but for reasons
unknown they come to
a larger amount.
Tribunal accepts that Ms Alfred did face such problems and that she did not
deliberately under-estimate her income. Her financial
arrangements are somewhat
complicated, and it would have been hard for her to accurately estimate her
income. Nonetheless, the Tribunal
must review the matter on the basis of the
clearer information that is now available.
the power in
section 63AA
to reject an estimate is a discretionary one, the
Tribunal must weigh up the options. One option is to reject the estimate. The
of that would be that Ms Alfred would be assessed on the basis of her
2009/2010 adjusted taxable income of $84,204 during the period
in question. The
downside of that option is that Ms Alfred would be assessed on an income
considerably higher than her likely annualised
income during the estimate
period. The other option is to leave the estimate in place, even though it was
too low. It would be reconciled
in due course, once Ms Alfred lodges her
2010/2011 income tax return, and so the rate of child support would be adjusted
Ms Alfred’s actual annualised income during the period in
question. The downside of that option is that Mr Alfred may have
to wait some
considerable time until the reconciliation can be done, and the rate of child
support reduced for the period in question.
the Tribunal does not want to be thought to be condoning the lodgement of under-
estimates, on balance it considers the preferable
course in this case would be
to leave the estimate in place, rather than to now reject it (with retrospective
effect). The period
in question has finished. The under-estimate was not
deliberate. Ms Alfred’s income had decreased from the overall level in
2009/2010. The estimate will be reconciled in due course, and so ultimately the
child support will be based on the amount that Ms
Alfred should have estimated.
The Tribunal considers that the detriment that would flow to Ms Alfred from the
rejection of the estimate
outweighs the detriment that will flow to Mr Alfred
from its continued acceptance. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not exercise the
section 63AA
to reject the estimate of
On 23 August 2011 the
Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review. This means the application
for review is not successful.
