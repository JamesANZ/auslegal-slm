per cent was ordered [46].

‘Of Aboriginal Heritage’ [16].

attending school after Year 7 [19].
Did not attain
employment [26].
Developed a drug
addiction [26].
The offending conduct was the
murder of a shopkeeper on his premises. On the afternoon of 3 March 2001, the
offender left a drinking
establishment and entered the shop owned by the victim
[3]. A witness claimed that the offender appeared to be arguing with the victim,
with the offender holding a knife and moving towards the victim as he called for
observed the offender leaving
the store, with persons in the nearby drinking establishment stating they saw
her running away from
the shop [4]. All those who witnessed the event claimed
the offender appeared to have blood on her clothing [4].
The victim was then found behind the counter of his shop, suffering from a
fatal stab wound to the chest, as well as defensive wounds
on both arms [5]. The
knife used to kill the victim was left on the counter and matched others in the
store [6]. The offender’s
blood covered palm print was also found on a
refrigerator door in the shop [6]. Upon the arrest of the offender, the
wallet and watch were in her possession [7]. As the offender
refused to be interviewed, the Court was not able to determine why the
entered the shop, what the victim and offender said to each other in raised
voices, or determine the offender’s intent
that led to the killing
Procedural History
The offender’s history of drug use and mental health issues led to the
first attempt to try her in February 2003 resulting in
the jury declaring her
unfit to be tried [13]. In September that year, the Mental Health Review
Tribunal declared the offender would
not be fit to stand trial within the next
12 months [13]. After the intervention of the NSW Attorney General, the offender
fit to be tried in June 2004 [13]. The jury rejected the
offender’s self-defence claim and found her guilty, with Miles AJ
nominating a sentence of no more than 17 years imprisonment [13]. Nearly ten
years later, the Mental Health Review Tribunal held
that the offender’s
mental state had improved to the extent that she could now enter a plea [15].
After pleading not guilty,
the offender’s psychiatrist withdrew their
opinion contending the offender could claim the defence of mental illness. This
led to the offender changing her plea to guilty [44]-[46]. The decision of Hulme
AJ in the present case was the formal sentencing
of the offender [14].

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/or indicators
Evidence was presented noting that the offender was of Aboriginal heritage,
and that her time spent with her natural parents was ‘characterised
neglect and poor parental supervision.’ [16] The offender was also exposed
to alcohol abuse and incidents of family violence
[16]. This included the murder
of her grandmother by her grandfather, ‘though it is not
the offender witnessed this incident
After moving to Sydney and attending a centre for Aboriginal children in the
inner city, the offender went to live with another family
in a foster
arrangement [17]. Throughout her time with the foster family, the offender was
violent, frequently truanted, and often
ran away back to her natural mother for
weeks at a time [18]-[21]. Her natural mother was ‘often drunk, with
almost no furniture
and never food in the house’ [17].While the
offender’s exact age at the time of her leaving school was uncertain, the
offender did not complete any schooling after Year 7 [19]. Between then and her
incarceration, the offender never attained employment
Numerous reports were conducted by social services bodies throughout the
offender’s life attesting to her lack of mental development
and possible
psychiatric conditions, with Moree Children’s Court describing her as
‘very unstable, disruptive and emotionally
disturbed’ [23]-[31]. The
offender proved to be a ‘diagnostic challenge’ for psychiatrists who
best-assessed her
as suffering from ‘an anti-social personality disorder
and a paranoid personality disorder’ [29]. However, her ongoing
addiction and the ’dramatic improvement of her mental state’ in
2013, which the Court considered likely due to medication,
meant mental illness
could no longer be considered a defence for the offender in this case [29].
Furthermore, Hulme J considered
that the offender’s ability to gain a
criminal record and support herself, ‘through crime or otherwise’
[26], meant
that whilst her cognitive function may be impaired, it is not
substantial enough to act as a mitigating factor [26], [42].
Hulme J did acknowledge that many of the factors that caused the offender to
act as she did were due to her genetics or upbringing
in an Aboriginal family
experiencing disadvantage [41]. The Court acknowledged that the decision in
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
requires that Aboriginality and exposure
to disadvantage be considered where appropriate in sentencing. However, in
deciding her sentence,
the offender’s Aboriginal background and
disadvantaged upbringing were rejected as substantially mitigating factors
The Court opined that this was not because of the severity of the
disadvantage the offender faced. Rather, it was the objective
seriousness of
the crime, the use of a weapon and the vulnerability of people working in
convenience stores like the victim meant
other public policy considerations
warranted a long sentence [37], [40], [46], [54].
Relevant passages
‘Factors to which weight must be given include the Prisoner’s
cognitive functioning and her upbringing. I have referred
to these. However, it
takes no great mental ability or education to know that one should not threaten
people with knives, much less
use such weapons against others.’ [40]
‘One must recognise the assessments referring, for example, to the
Prisoner’s aggression, low frustration tolerance, poor
impulse control,
instability and emotional disturbance – characteristics I would attribute
to her genes or upbringing. One
may accept, as the High Court said in –
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at
“The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol
abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person
throughout life.”’
