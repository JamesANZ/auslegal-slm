R v Taudevin [1996] VicRp 74; [1996] 2 VR 402 (19 February 1996)
R v TAUDEVIN
SUPREME COURT OF VICTORIA COURT OF APPEAL
WINNEKE P, CALLAWAY JA and HAMPEL AJA
15, 19 February 1996
I will ask Hampel AJA to deliver the first judgment of the court.
The applicant and a co-accused, Tapscott, both pleaded guilty in the County Court to one count of armed robbery committed on 30 January
1994. According to the applicant, Tapscott was the first to mention "the job" and the applicant said "Come on then, let's do it".
They had both been taking Rohypnol and other pills. "The job" involved either stealing or forcibly taking money from a man named
Gaitley, who worked at the Upper Ferntree Gully railway station and who himself is alleged to have been involved in stealing but
has not yet been tried.
The applicant armed himself with a tomahawk and Tapscott was aware of this. At the railway station Tapscott remained outside and
the applicant went in. It transpired that Gaitley had left, and the victim, Mr Bucknell, was in the office. The applicant produced
the tomahawk, which he held above his shoulder, and asked for the money from the safe. He said, "I'm not going to hurt you. Give
me all the money". He took just over $2000, which included coins and cheques. Understandably, the victim, Mr Bucknell, was very frightened.
On 3 March the police went to the applicant's flat. The applicant said he knew why they were there and immediately admitted his involvement
in the robbery. He thereafter continued to co-operate and described his role in a record of interview. He said that they had shared
the proceeds, although Tapscott, when he was interviewed, said that he had received only about $300. Both men refused to name each
other as the co-offender.
After hearing pleas in mitigation and finding that the two men had agreed to be involved in this crime, although each played a different
role, the learned judge sentenced Tapscott, who was 26 years of age, to two years' imprisonment, which he fully suspended. He sentenced
the applicant, who was 29, to four and a half years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of three and a half years.
On the face of this and in these circumstances, the questions which one immediately asks are why the difference and why such a difference?
Ground 2 of this application for leave to appeal against sentence, that is, that the judge failed to apply the principles of parity,
raises these very questions.
There is little to distinguish between the two offenders in the commission of the offence itself, although the applicant played the
more active role. That is, however, not significant in a joint enterprise in these circumstances. Also, they both co-operated with
the police and both pleaded guilty.
The real difference between them lies in the fact that Tapscott has no prior convictions, a good employment record and a supportive
family, while the applicant had a deprived childhood and a long history of offending since he was 15. His prior convictions from
eight court appearances between 1983 and 1990 include 102 convictions for dishonesty, nine for drug-related offences and five convictions
for various kinds of assaults.
The law is well settled that it is obviously desirable that persons who are parties to the commission of the same offence should
receive the same sentence, but matters such as age, background, previous criminal history, character and the role played in the commission
of the offence, of course, have to be taken into account. Some disparity between sentences imposed on co-offenders is not in itself
a ground for intervention by an appellate court. The difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive, and the court
will intervene in such a case on the ground that the disparity engenders a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the accused
on whom the heavier sentence is imposed, or on the ground that the disparity gives the appearance that justice has not been done:
see Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 606. It is also well established that punishment must be appropriate to the crime and cannot be
greater by reason of prior convictions. Put another way, a person cannot be punished twice for the -
same offences, first when the past offences are dealt with and then when a subsequent offence is committed. The existence of previous
convictions is, of course, relevant in that it may negate the mitigatory factor of good rehabilitation prospects. It may also be
a factor which calls for a greater need for specific deterrence, and in some cases the protection of the community.
In the present case, the only real difference between the two offenders was the applicant's criminal history. In considering its
significance, it was necessary, as I think the learned judge did, to take into account the applicant's disadvantaged background,
which no doubt was significant in his early offending. There was clearly a need to differentiate between the two offenders because
of the good character of one and the history of offending by the other. The difference, however, in my opinion, is manifestly too
great. A two year sentence for Tapscott in all the circumstances is so disparate from the four and a half years sentence as to engender
in the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance. This is further exacerbated and gives the appearance that justice was not done
when one considers that the two year sentence was fully suspended and the co-offender did not have to spend any time in custody,
while the applicant is incarcerated for up to four and a half years.
In my opinion, Ground 2 is made out. The application for leave to appeal should be allowed and the applicant resentenced.
I would ask my brother Callaway to deliver the next judgment of the court.
Callaway JA
As Hampel AJA has explained, an appellate court intervenes because of disparity only where the difference between the two sentences
is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance or to give the appearance in the mind of an objective
observer that justice has not been done.
The important words are "manifestly", "justifiable" and "objective". There is much to be said for the view that all three requirements
are variations on the same theme, ie that only a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive will
satisfy the other two requirements. However that may be, it is certainly true that a sense of grievance is not justifiable unless
it would be shared by an objective observer.
That proposition may be found in Lowe's case in the judgment of Gibbs CJ at 610, where his Honour said that the disparity must be
"such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done".
At 613 Mason J spoke of the disparity as engendering a justifiable sense of grievance "and" an appearance of injustice to the objective
bystander. It is not to be thought that Dawson J intended a different test by using the word "or". At 623 his Honour was using it,
as I have done, in its epexegetical, not its disjunctive, sense. Wilson J agreed with both the other members of the majority.
I am disposed to think that the applicant played a more important role in the commission of the offence than his co-offender, but
the principal explanation for the difference between the sentences lies in the fact that specific deterrence had to be a major objective
in the case of the applicant. It was not such an objective in the case of the co-offender, who, as the judge found, was unlikely
to re-offend.
Specific deterrence also goes a long way towards explaining the severity of the sentence, including the non-parole period, imposed
on the applicant. In Veen v R -
(No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 464 at 477, Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ, after referring to the need to avoid punishing a person
twice by reference to his prior convictions, continued: ... The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether
the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence
a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate
that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates
the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity OR SHOWS A NEED TO IMPOSE CONDIGN PUNISHMENT
TO DETER THE OFFENDER and other offenders FROM COMMITTING FURTHER OFFENCES OF A LIKE KIND. [Emphasis added.]
The difference between the head sentence and the non-parole period in this case may also be explained in part by the punitive consideration
referred to by Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Bugmy v R
[1990] HCA 18
(1990) 169 CLR 525
at 538 and by the Full Court in R v Chan
(1994) 76 A Crim R 252
I differ with great reluctance from Hampel AJA, but I cannot discern any error in the sentence imposed below. Accordingly I would
dismiss the application.
I agree in the reasons delivered by my brother Callaway. Like him, I cannot discern error in the trial judge's reasoning or the imposition
of his sentence, and I too would dismiss the application.
In accordance with the judgments thus delivered, the formal order of the court is that the application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
