DATE OF DESPATCH
REASONS FOR
Simon Lang and Ms Julie Lang are the parents of Michael (born 1999), Joseph
(born 2000) and Karly (born 2003). There has been a
child support assessment
made by the Child Support Agency (CSA) in place since 25 October 2007. Prior to
4 March 2011, all three
children were assessed as being in Ms Lang’s care
for 100% of the time. From 4 March 2011, Karly and Joseph were assessed as
in Ms Lang’s care for 74% of the time and in Mr Lang’s care for 26%
of the time.
the period 6 May 2010 to 30 September 2010, Mr Lang was assessed to pay an
annual rate of $22,176 based on his provisional adjusted
taxable income of
$105,000 and Ms Lang’s adjusted taxable income for 2008/09 of
the period 1 October 2010 to 3 March 2011, Mr Lang was assessed to pay an annual
rate of $27,496 based on his advice of his adjusted
taxable income of $130,000
for 2009/10 and Ms Lang’s adjusted taxable income for 2008/09 of $36,897.
The amount payable reduced
from 4 March 2011 following the change in care
arrangements recorded for Karly and Joseph.
2 December 2010, Ms Lang applied for an increase to the assessment because of Mr
Lang’s income and financial resources and
because of the children’s
special needs and educational costs.
Lang lodged a cross-application on the basis of his costs of contact with the
children and the costs of the children’s special
22 February 2011, a senior case officer, acting as a delegate of the Child
Support Registrar (the Registrar), considered the application
and decided to
depart from the assessment and to:
set his adjusted
taxable income at $143,000 for the period 1 October 2010 to 31 December 2011;
increase the
annual rate of child support payable by $10,500 from 1 October 2010 to 31
December 2010 and by $8,390 from 1 January
2011 to 31 December
Lang lodged an objection to the senior case officer’s decision on 9 March
CSA objections officer reconsidered the departure application and decided to
partly allow the objection on 5 May 2011. The objections
officer decided to
adjusted taxable income at $140,000 for the period 1 October 2010 to 30
September 2011 and at $145,600 from 1 October
2011 to 30 September 2012; and
increase the
annual rate of child support payable by $13,272 for the period 1 October 2010 to
31 December 2010 and by $7,500 for the
period 1 January 2011 to 31 December
effect of this decision was that the annual rate of child support payable
increased to:
$42,660 per
annum from 1 October 2010 to 31 December 2010,
$36,888 for the
period 1 January 2011 to 3 March 2011,
$31,512 for the
period 4 March 2011 to 30 September 2011; and
$32,401 for the
period 1 October 2011 to 31 December 2011.
11 May 2011, Mr Lang lodged with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the
tribunal) an application for review of the CSA’s
decision of 5 May

CONSIDERATION
The legislative
framework and issues for the tribunal to determine.
rate of child support payable by a liable parent is usually based on an
administrative assessment under
Child Support (Assessment) Act
(the Assessment Act). This requires the application of a statutory
formula which takes into account factors such as the number of
children, the
level of care provided and the income of each parent.
liable parent or a carer may apply to the Child Support Registrar (the
Registrar) for a determination to depart from the child
support administrative
assessment under Part 6A of the Assessment Act (section 98B). Section 98C
provides that the Registrar may
make a determination to depart from the formula
assessment and establishes a three step process. The Registrar, and the tribunal
standing in place of the Registrar, must be satisfied:
(i) that one, or more than one, of the grounds for departure referred to
in subsection (2)
exists; and
(ii) that it would be:
(A) just and equitable as regards the child, the liable parent, and the
carer entitled to child support; and
(B) otherwise proper;

and otherwise proper to make a particular determination,
the tribunal must make
one of the determinations prescribed in section 98S of the Assessment Act.
Section 98S sets out the determinations
that may be made under the departure
provisions. It permits a range of determinations, including varying the rate of

Issue one – Does a ground exist to depart
from the administrative assessment? The income, property and financial resources
Lang sought a departure from the administrative assessment on the ground that Mr
Lang’s income and financial resources were
not reflected in the adjusted
taxable incomes used in the assessment.
grounds for departure are set out in subsection 117(2) of the Assessment Act.
Subparagraph 117(2)(c)(ia) provides as grounds
for departure:
(c) that, in the special circumstances of the case, application in
relation to the child of the provisions of this Act relating to
administrative
assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable
determination of the level of financial support
to be provided by the liable
parent for the child:

(7A) In having regard to the income, property and financial resources of a
parent of the child, the court must:

any assets of, under the control of, or held for the benefit
of, the parent that

the Full Family Court
indicated that for there to be special circumstances, the facts of the case must
establish something which is
special or out of the ordinary.
the hearing Mr Lang acknowledged that his current income is higher than the
incomes used in the child support assessment although
he has a number of income
tax deductions. He said that his current salary is $145,000 per annum, but
stressed that when he started
work with his employer in November 2008, his
income was $110,000. He explained that his payment summary for the 2010 year
gross income of $148,556 as he cashed in some annual leave and also
received a Christmas bonus of $3,000. He stated that his income
is reviewed at
Christmas and that whilst he is hopeful of a bonus this year there is no
Lang stated that he received no other benefits from his employment and does not
have a corporate credit card. He told the tribunal
that the vehicle he leases is
in his name. It was the former family car. He said that he had just renewed the
lease as he was unable
to meet the $14,000 residual payment. He said that he
thought that the lease payments were now about $800 a month.
Lang said that he uses the car for personal use and for meetings for work. He
is not reimbursed for mileage and will claim a tax
deduction. The distance to
and from work is 38.2 kilometres each way. Mr Lang stated that the income tax
return for the 2010 year
at folio A18 of the papers is not yet lodged. He has
not lodged an income tax return since 2006, claiming that Ms Lang prevented
access to necessary records.
Lang told the tribunal that the amount stated for Centrelink payment on folio
A19 was a mistake made by his accountant and related
to a previous year. He
stated that he will be claiming 12% of the purchase price of his vehicle as a
deduction as he kept a log book
for work travel.
tribunal asked Mr Lang about the other deductions of $3,757 claimed at folio
A20. He said that this figure included depreciation
on his laptop purchased
Foxtel, needed to keep up
to date in his position as the club representative on
the Board of Directors of a league club.
said that in the 2011 year he will also be able to claim a tax offset for
medical expenses in excess of $2,000. He said that his
total costs for that year
were about $10,000 and that about $7,000 relate to the
tribunal asked Mr Lang about the educational costs noted in his statement of
financial circumstances form at folio A8. He said
that this is for travel
overseas that is allowed by the club’s board as an educational cost. He
said that he was paid wages
for travel for a week in August 2010 and also
received a living away from home allowance. He went with two work colleagues.
included tours, fairs and meetings. In February 2011 he went for two
weeks on his own. His employer did not meet the expenses and
he will claim a tax
Lang stated that he has also hosted staff rewards trips in 2009 and 2010.
Fourteen staff members from the club were selected to
travel and attend seminars
for four days. He is paid as usual and his employer has paid his expenses for
those trips.
the tribunal queried why his employer did not meet the costs for business
travel, Mr Lang stated that his employer wanted to
limit training expenditure,
but that it is important to network and liaise.
Lang stated that the mobile telephone provided by his employer is for work use
only. He has his own mobile telephone.
Lang commented that when they were married, Mr Lang had worked in similar
positions and that he had always chosen to travel. Ms
Lang said that the trips
and were voluntary. She queried if Mr Lang
also had meals provided by the club as noted in his contract.
Lang stated that he works business hours, Monday to Friday but that he also
attends meetings out of hours and occasionally works
on weekends. He said that
coffee is provided by the club but that he chooses not to eat there because of
the choice of food available.
Assessment of evidence,
findings of fact and application of the law
tribunal considered the oral and documentary evidence provided by Mr Lang and Ms
Lang, as well as the information available on
tribunal notes that Mr Lang is employed on a full-time basis and that the salary
shown on his most recent payslip is $145,000
per annum. The payslips do not
indicate any fringe benefits or any salary sacrifice arrangement, however the
tribunal notes that
Mr Lang’s employer provides him with some meals and
also pays various expenses towards overseas trips some of which it appears
Lang undertakes on a voluntary basis as although he is paid his salary during
the trip and receives a living allowance, the costs
of travel are not otherwise
met by his employer. Similarly Mr Lang’s employer does not compensate him
for any business use
of his motor vehicle.
the 2010/2011 financial year, Mr Lang received $148,556 in salary and wages. The
additional amount received above his regular salary
consisted of annual leave
which was cashed out and a bonus paid. Mr Lang acknowledged that he is likely to
cash out further annual
leave in the current financial year and that he might
similarly receive a bonus from his employment at Christmas. The tribunal notes
that Mr Lang has received regular increases in his income from employment since
he started work in November 2008 on a salary of $110,000.
His salary is reviewed
at Christmas each year.
Lang has not lodged income tax returns since 2006. He provided the tribunal with
a draft return for the 2009/2010 financial year
(folios A18 to A30) which
included gross salary and wages of $134,029. The tribunal notes that it
incorrectly retuned income of $1,891
from Centrelink, which was not received
that year. The draft return shows total deductions of $10,297 consisting of work
car expenses, $6,396; uniforms and laundry, $144; and other work related
expenses, $3,757.
Lang also provided the tribunal with a copy of an email showing communication
with his accountant in August 2011 about the deductions
claimed in the draft
return (folio A15). Mr Lang indicated that he wished to use the 12% method (of
the vehicle acquisition cost
of $53,300) for work related car expenses. However,
the tribunal notes that in his evidence at the hearing, although he spoke about
maintaining a log book in the past in a period when he had to travel, the
current work travel described by Mr Lang would not amount
to travel of 5,000 per
annum so as to entitle him to a deduction of 12% of the cost of the vehicle. Mr
Lang stated that more than
76 kilometres per day (over 18,000 per annum) is
travel to and from work in addition to his travel twice every second weekend to
have contact with Karly and Joseph (about 6,500 kilometres per annum) and other
private travel. His total annual mileage since September
2009 is stated as being
25,000 kilometres (folio A82).
his evidence to the tribunal, Mr Lang was also unable to provide much detail
He noted depreciation on a
laptop that was purchased for about $3,000 some three years ago, fees and
membership and a Foxtel subscription.
tribunal considers that the income tax deductions Mr Lang has claimed in the
draft return may not properly reflect the actual
costs that he incurs for work
related expenses.
Lang indicated that he would also be able to claim business travel in the
2010/2011 financial year, however, he has not yet prepared
that return and the
net cost of the travel is not known. Given that the travel was not a requirement
of Mr Lang’s employment
and appeared to have a personal component, the
tribunal does not propose to have regard to any income tax deduction that might
claimed in considering Mr Lang’s income. Neither does the tribunal
propose to regard the contribution made by Mr Lang’s
employer for such
trips as a financial resource.
tribunal found that Mr Lang’s taxable income for the 2010/2011 financial
year is likely to be in the vicinity of $145,000,
comprised of $148,556 less
reasonable deductions of about $3,500. His income is likely to increase after
his salary review in December
2011 to at least $150,000 in the 2012 calendar
year. As these figures are significantly higher than the adjusted taxable
of $105,000 and $130,000 previously used for Mr Lang in the child
support assessments, the tribunal finds that there is a
established under subparagraph 117(2)(c)(ia) on which to depart from the
assessment.
Mr Lang’s costs of contact with the
this case Mr Lang had sought a departure from the administrative assessment on
the ground that his costs of maintaining contact
with his children were
significant.
grounds for departure are set out in subsection 117(2) of the Assessment Act.
Subparagraph 117(2)(b)(i) provides as a ground
for departure:
(b) that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of
maintaining the child are significantly affected:
(i) because of high costs involved in enabling a parent to spend time
with, or communicate with, the child; or
117(2B) sets out when a parent’s costs in enabling them to care of a child
can be considered high.
High costs involved in enabling

(2B) A parent’s costs involved in enabling the parent to care for a
child can only be high for the purposes of subparagraph
(2)(a)(iv) or (2)(b)(i)
if the costs that have been or will be incurred, during a child support period,
total more than 5% of the
amount worked out by:
(a) dividing the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the period by
(b) multiplying the quotient by the number of days in the
previously noted, the term
‘special circumstances’
defined in the Assessment Act. In
Gyselman v Gyselman

[1992] FLC 92-279
the Full Family Court indicated that for there to be special circumstances,
the facts of the case must establish something which is
special or out of the
the hearing the tribunal asked Mr Lang about the costs set out at folios A77 to
A82. It noted that the costs listed included the
costs for extracurricular
activities, medical costs, car running costs and the cost of payment to Ms Lang
for fuel as ordered by
Lang stated that he included costs for the children where they fell on his
weekend. He also included the cost of fuel, accommodation
and meals. Prior to
September 2009, he had left work early on Friday and driven to collect the
children and take Karly to her medical
appointment. They would then stay in a
motel and drive to his home after sport on Saturday. He would return the
children on Sunday
and then drive back home.
Lang contended that if it were not for him having care of the children, he would
not have a vehicle and therefore the costs of
the lease, registration, and the
like should be included. He said that he could get the train to work, but
acknowledged that he would
have difficulty attending work meetings that were not
held on the premises.
Lang stated that he now meets Ms Lang and the children halfway between the two
residences. He said that he had to pay Ms Lang $30
and included that amount. He
acknowledged that the court orders made on 8 February 2011 (folio 103) provide
for the payment of $30
to Ms Lang and note that
‘he shall not seek an
adjustment from the Child Support Agency in relation to that payment.’
Mr Lang stated that he had agreed to the payment as he
think he would be screwed by the CSA a bit later’
Lang acknowledged that his current costs of contact are not more than 5% of his
income, but said that they were 18 months ago.
He saw the children fortnightly
until 11 September 2009. Contact with Karly and Joseph resumed in May 2010.
During the intervening
time Mr Lang said that he saw the children at
psychological assessments and on other occasions.
Lang noted that until 20 March 2011, the CSA based the assessment on him having
no overnight contact. He said that he did not object
to the decision that the
CSA made about the percentage of care as he was told that he would have no
success. He said that he had
hoped that it would be addressed in the change of
assessment decision.
Lang commented that the expenses set out by Mr Lang seemed to be excessive. She
said that expenses for such things as the cinema
and lunches are more than she
would spend on the children.
Lang stated that he took the children to activities on rainy weekends when they
could not play in the park. He noted that contact
with the children was
artificial and that he necessarily incurred entertainment
Assessment of evidence, findings of fact and
application of the law
tribunal was satisfied that Mr Lang has costs related to his contact with the
children. In the period from June 2009 until September
2009, Mr Lang had weekend
considering the contact costs, the tribunal is required to consider the costs of
enabling the parent to spend time with, or communicate
with, the child, rather
than to enjoy that time or communication (
Hall and Rushton
92-252). The law allows telephone and internet costs to be considered as well as
accommodation and transport (
Gyselman and Gyselman
[1991] FamCA 93
(1992) FLC 92-279
Transport costs include: parking costs; road tolls; train, ferry, taxi or bus
fares; airfares; the cost of car hire; and motor
vehicle expenses. However, the
cost of entertainment cannot be included, as this is a cost of enjoying, rather
than enabling, the
time spent or communication with the child.
1 July 2008, subsection 117(2C) of the Assessment Act provides that if a person
has at least regular care of a child (at least
52 nights per year) the only
costs that can be taken into account for the purposes of subsection 117(2B) of
the Assessment Act are
the costs related to travel to enable the person to spend
time with, or communicate with, the child.
means that for the period from 4 March 2011, the time from which Mr Lang has
been assessed as having regular care of Karly and
Joseph, only the costs of
travel can be considered. The tribunal notes that the overall contact costs have
reduced significantly
and from June 2010, Mr Lang’s costs of contact are
the cost of fuel to travel to and from his place of residence and the meeting
point, estimated by him at $60 for each weekend visit.
tribunal does not accept Mr Lang’s proposition that the contact costs also
include the other costs of running his motor
vehicle such as registration,
insurance, lease payments and maintenance. When calculating motor vehicle
expenses the CSA’s
policy is that it will generally accept that the actual
cost (rather than the tax rate, AAA, NRMA, RACQ or other motor association
is allowable. That policy is supported by the decision of
Houlihan and
(1991) FLC 92-248
. The tribunal notes that the tax rate is designed
for car travel up to 5000 km to take account of the additional costs of
and maintaining a commercial vehicle and is not an appropriate measure
for the costs. In considering a parent's actual costs, the
proportion of use of
the vehicle for the purposes of spending time with, or communicating with the
child, needs to be considered.
Mr Lang contends that he would not have a motor vehicle were it not for his
not accept this proposition.
Although he could use public transport to travel to and from work, he does not
do so. As Mr Lang acknowledged,
the lack of a vehicle would cause him difficulty
with the work travel he does undertake and would reduce his ability to work
hours as he described at the hearing. The travel to have contact with the
children is a minor portion of Mr Lang’s overall
running costs of his
vehicle, the majority of which is for travel to and from work.
can the tribunal regard the $30 payment to Ms Lang as a cost of contact. The
court orders specifically provide that Mr Lang
should not seek a reduction of
child support on that basis. It would not be appropriate for the tribunal to go
behind that court
relation to the legal expenses claimed by Mr Lang, his legal costs (folios A88
to A102) cannot be included as a cost of enabling
him to spend time with his
[2005] FMCAfam 261).
tribunal is not satisfied that Mr Lang’s costs of contact with Karly and
Joseph since June 2010 are high, as his costs of
travel and communication of up
to $150 per fortnight ($3,900 per annum) do not exceed 5% of the adjusted
taxable incomes used in
the original formula assessment.
Lang’s costs for the period from June 2009 to September 2009 were higher,
as they included some costs of accommodation to
enable contact. The costs of
meals and activities during contact visits cannot be considered. The tribunal
does not consider that
those costs provide special circumstances for which to
change the assessment as they do not appear to have exceeded 5% of Mr
adjusted taxable income. Also, Mr Lang did not raise this issue
with the CSA until he responded to Ms Lang’s change of assessment
application in December 2010 (folios 350 to 362).
tribunal therefore decided that the ground for departure in subparagraph
117(2)(b)(i) of the Assessment Act does not exist.
costs related to the children’s special needs
Lang also sought consideration of an increase to the assessment on the basis
that he had significant costs associated with the
children’s medical
expenses and counselling as well as medical costs for Karly.
grounds for departure are set out in subsection 117(2) of the Assessment Act.
Subparagraph 117(2)(b)(ia) provides as a ground
for departure:
(b) that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of
maintaining the child are significantly affected:
(ia) because of special needs of the child; or
discussed previously in this decision, the term ‘special
circumstances’ is not defined in the Assessment Act. In
[1991] FamCA 93
[1992] FLC 92-279
the Full Family Court indicated that for there to
be special circumstances, the facts of the case must establish something which
special or out of the ordinary.
the hearing Mr Lang said that in the 2011 financial year, he spent about $7,000
on the children’s medical expenses including
the costs of psychological
counselling since March 2011. In relation to the expenses listed at folio A76,
he said that Michael has
not completed his medical treatment yet, but he is led
to believe that further treatment will be required and that two of the children
will have additional medical expenses.
tribunal noted that the court orders of 8 February 2011 require Mr Lang to meet
the children’s medical expenses and to pay
health insurance premiums. He
said that it came down to the school fees and that he was not able to meet the
medical expenses and
the school fees as well. He stated that the medical costs
should have priority over the school fees.
Lang stated that he expects the medical costs to continue to be high and that he
envisages that the children will continue to need
counselling in the foreseeable
future. He said that Joseph needs medical treatment which will cost about
$1,600, less a $350 rebate.
Lang said that Karly’s need for medical treatment needs to be reassessed
and that she has not attended since September 2009.
She is to be reassessed next
week. Mr Lang stated that she has a condition and he expects further treatment
will be required.
Lang told the tribunal that the children do not have severe psychological
issues. They have been attending therapeutic counselling
sessions. She noted
that Mr Lang wanted psychological assessments and that he had been required to
pay. She noted that a recent report
indicated that treatment may only continue
for a little while longer and would not be required long term.
Lang said that Karly’s condition had been addressed and that Karly’s
teacher does not report a problem. Ms Lang said
that whilst a therapist would no
doubt say further work is required, Karly is performing well in
Lang said that she was advised last year that Michael will require treatment in
18 months to two years’ time. Joseph needs
treatment for six months. She
said that Michael had the same glasses since kindergarten, so she purchased him
new glasses last year.
She also purchased glasses that had been prescribed for
Karly. All three children had other treatments at a cost of about $900. The
children have regular dental check-ups which are provided in the State. They
also attend the doctor occasionally.
Lang stated that although the court orders allow her to claim the
children’s medical expenses on Mr Lang’s health insurance
she has not done so as it would be
complicated’
Lang commented that Ms Lang had been given a card for the health cover and that
she should be able to use the HICAPS system or
to make a claim directly to the
health fund.
Assessment of evidence, findings of fact and
application of the law
is no dispute that Mr Lang has incurred substantial costs for the
children’s medical treatment. The tribunal accepts that
after applicable
rebates from Medicare and his insurer, Mr Lang has out of pocket expenses of
year although the tribunal notes that
he will be able to claim a significant tax offset when he lodges his income tax
tribunal also notes that Ms Lang has met some of the children’s medical
expenses. However, she is able to rely on the terms
of the court order to seek a
complete reimbursement from the insurer or Mr Lang if she
is some dispute between the parties as to whether some of the costs, will
continue in the long term or whether Karly will need
further treatment. However,
the parties do not disagree that both Michael and Joseph will require treatment
in the future
any event, the court orders of 8 February 2011 specifically require Mr Lang to
meet the children’s medical expenses and Karly’s
treatment. The
court orders of 11 August 2010 (folios 275 and 276) note that Mr Lang agreed to
meet selected costs. For those reasons
the tribunal is satisfied that there are
no special circumstances that would allow the tribunal to find that a ground to
depart from

Assessment Act because of the costs related to the children’s
expenses, counselling and speech therapy.
children’s school fees
this case, Ms Lang has asked for a departure from the assessment on the basis
that she incurs private school fees for Michael,
grounds for departure are set out in subsection 117(2) of the Assessment Act.
Subparagraph 117(2)(b)(ii) provides as a ground
for departure:
(b) that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of
maintaining the child are significantly affected:
(ii) because the child is being cared for, educated or trained in the
manner that was expected by his or her parents;

the hearing Mr Lang acknowledged that he and Ms Lang had intended for all three
children to attend private school. In 2007 the
boys were enrolled at the school
and Karly had attended pre-school at the school for two days a week. However, he
said that when
they were married they had struggled to pay the fees and that a
business was purchased in order to allow Ms Lang to work and therefore
Lang stated that the school had not granted financial relief as referred to in
the court orders. He said that he has not paid school
fees since 2007 and
claimed that legal expenses have impacted on his ability to pay the
Lang stated that she and Mr Lang had previously had no trouble paying the school
fees. She said that the purchase of the business
was for her and not just in
order to pay the fees. She stated that in late 2007 they had each agreed to pay
half of the fees. A sum
of $30,000 from the property settlement was paid to the
school to pay the fees and it was not until later that she discovered that
Lang had not been paying his half.
Lang took on the responsibility and now pays $1,200 a month, although the school
are pressuring her for a new payment arrangement
(folio B45). She agreed that
the fees are about $15,000 per annum.
Lang noted that at the end of 2010 he owed about $3,000. He said that the school
had split the $30,000 equally between them.
tribunal asked Mr Lang whether it would be fair for him to be responsible for
more than 50% of the school fees given his higher
income. He said that Ms Lang
has a greater capacity to work and that she worked full-time prior to having the
children. He acknowledged
that Ms Lang did not work at the time they separated,
but said that they had bought the business with the intention that she would
work. The business had not started trading when they separated. Mr Lang said
that Ms Lang could earn between $50,000 and $60,000
Lang stated that she had not worked since before Michael was born. Although
they had purchased a business so that she could work
part-time when the children
were at school, it had not started trading. She said that she took the job in
the school canteen as it
meant that she did not have to have before or after
school care or holiday care for the children.
Lang told the tribunal that she stated a new job on Monday 29 August 2011. She
was no longer entitled to parenting payment once
Karly turned 8 years old. Her
income is now $40,000 per annum. Ms Lang will receive about the same amount as
in her former position
but will be paid for the

is no dispute that both Mr Lang and Ms Lang intended that the children would
attend private school and that they have been,
and are being, educated in a
manner that is expected by their parents.
Lang did not dispute the costs as calculated by the CSA. There was no dispute
that an amount of $30,000 was paid to the school
following the property
settlement and that this sum was used to pay school fees until the latter part
of 2010. Mr Lang has not paid
school fees since those funds were

(folios B21 to B23). However, folio B48
sets out the tuition fees payable for
the 2011 school year. In 2011, Michael is in Year 6, Joseph in Year 5 and Karly
The fees payable for 2011 will be $5,680 for Michael, $4,484 for
Joseph (95% of $4,720) and $3,776 for Karly (80% of $4,720), a total
of $13,940.
In 2012, with both Joseph and Michael in Middle School, the tribunal finds that
it could reasonably be expected that
the tuition fees will be in the vicinity of
$16,000. As the costs of private schooling significantly affects the overall
raising Michael, Joseph and Karly, the tribunal decided that the ground
for departure in subparagraph 117(2)(b)(ii) of the Assessment
Act exists in
relation to the private school fees.
Issue two –
Would departure from the administrative assessment be just and
Relevant law and evidence
the tribunal is satisfied that there are grounds to depart from the
administrative assessment of child support, the next step is
to consider whether
it is just and equitable to depart from the assessment. In deciding whether it
is just and equitable, the tribunal
must have regard to the following matters
set out in subsection 117(4) of the Assessment Act:
(a) the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child (as stated in
section 3); and
(b) the proper needs of the child; and
(c) the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the
(d) the income, property and financial resources of each parent who is a
party to the proceeding; and
(da) the earning capacity of each parent who is a party to the proceeding;
(e) the commitments of each parent who is a party to the proceeding that
are necessary to enable the parent to support:
(i) himself or herself; or
(ii) any other child or another person that the person has a duty to
maintain; and
(f) the direct and indirect costs incurred by the carer entitled to child
support in providing care for the child; and
(g) any hardship that would be caused:
(A) the child; or
(B) the carer entitled to child support;
by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order; and
(A) the liable parent; or
(B) any other child or another person that the liable parent has a duty to
by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order; and
tribunal considered the evidence provided by both parties, including the
Statement of Financial Circumstances form that each party
provided to the
tribunal (folios A1 to A8 and B1 to B8) as well as the documents provided by the
CSA and the parties.
Lang told the tribunal that he and Karen Walker purchased the house where he
lives, in 2010 for $371,500. They borrowed $290,000.
Ms Walker paid the deposit
and stamp duty. She is also paying for renovations. They are hoping to do some
work on the property and
then sell it at a profit.
Lang described himself and Ms Walker as
‘former partners’
stating that they are still on good terms. He said that Ms Walker bought the
house with him as she wanted to enter the property market.
He said that she has
a room at the house (that is also used by his children) but that she does not
live there, only staying sometimes.
She often stays with family. She is on a
pension and does not work. He said that his share in the house would be part of
which he has willed to his brother and sister.
Lang stated that he pays the mortgage payments, although he is currently paying
interest only. He also meets the rates and utility
bills. He said that he has a
verbal agreement with Ms Walker and that they will reconcile their respective
contributions to the house
at some point in time.
Lang said that he had previously been paying rent of $550 a week. He received
$40,000 from his grandmother’s estate which
was spent on legal
Lang noted that since he completed the statement of financial circumstances
form, the self-managed superannuation fund has been
wound up and the funds
deposited in his account. The tax he pays has also increased to $858 a week
because of the flood levy. His
health fund payments have also increased to $67
tribunal asked Mr Lang how he was meeting his stated weekly expenses that were
he borrowed money from his
parents and that they pay/have paid his bills sometimes, such as his rent,
telephone and internet bills.
Mr Lang stated that his parents keep a ledger of
the amount he owes them but did not state why he did not record the loan on the
statement of financial circumstances form.
Lang said that some of the expenses listed at folio A8 are wishful thinking. He
acknowledged that there might be some double counting
such as for toiletries and
household expenses.
Lang said that he travels about 25,000 to 35,000 kilometres a year in his car.
It is valued at about $10,000 and has 180,000 kilometres
Lang’s entertainment costs consist of going to the movies and getting
DVDs. He said that he did holiday with a friend for
a week in June 2011. He
also went interstate with colleagues following a work
conference.
tribunal noted that Mr Lang’s recent credit card statements and bank
statements still suggest a high level of discretionary
expenditure. The tribunal
asked Mr Lang if he had taken steps to reduce his spending. He said that he has
been living beyond his
means and no longer uses the credit card. He said that he
is not going on holiday and will cash in his annual leave to increase his
Lang stated that he mows the lawns himself but until last week had someone come
for three hours each fortnight to clean the house.
He said that he has spent
money on replacing second hand household appliances that were given to him by
friends and relatives. He
said that he spends about $2,500 a year on gifts for
family including his four nieces and parents.
stated that he has been attending counselling once a month since October 2010
and that this is likely to continue. The children
also participate in additional
activities at a cost of $100 per child, per term.
Lang stated that although he has had considerable legal expenses, he has no
outstanding bills at present
Lang told the tribunal that she now works until 4.30pm, Monday to Friday, with
occasional weekend work. The children do not require
before or after school
care, however she may need to make arrangements for school holidays if her
mother or friends cannot assist.
A camp for Michael during school holidays is
likely to cost about $500. She also has occasional child minding costs for court
Lang said that she no longer has a pension card. She also received
superannuation funds due to the split of the self-managed fund.
An amount of
$23,000 went to her fund.
Lang said that she borrowed money from her brother (folio B6) in early 2011 as a
tree fell on her car and it was written off. The
car was not comprehensively
insured. She purchased a car for $12,990. She is repaying her brother at $400 a

Assessment of evidence, findings of fact and
application of the law
3 of the Assessment Act states, accordingly, it is the primary duty of both
parents to financially support their children
and accordingly, Michael, Joseph
and Karly should receive a proper amount of financial support from their parents
in accordance with
their capacity to contribute.
Gyselman’s case the court said:
However, some of the matters listed in sub-section (4) may overlap
with matters already considered under sub-section [117](2) and
some of the
paragraphs in sub- section (4) may be more significant in one case than they
would be in another or of little relevance
in a particular case. It is an
essential part of the s.117 exercise to carry out the obligation under
sub-section (4). However,
that does not mean that it is necessary in each case
to slavishly go through each of the paragraphs. The extent to which it is
to do so will depend upon the facts and conduct of the individual case
and the analysis already performed under sub-section (2).’
parent has a duty to support any other person, apart from Michael, Joseph and
Karly. The tribunal notes that the children
are aged 12, 10 and 8. They do not
have income of their own that needs to be taken into account in the assessment.
Both parents intended
that the children would attend private school. The tuition
fees are $13,940 for 2011 and can reasonably be expected to be in the
of $16,000 in 2012.
Lang meets the cost of the children’s medical expenses. Those expenses are
now the subject of court orders between the parties
care. Mr Lang has other expenses in relation to his contact with Joseph and
Karly, such as food and accommodation
costs when they are in his care. Those
costs are taken into account in the reduction of child support he is assessed to
of a cost percentage of 24% in the child support assessment from 4
March 2011.
tribunal is satisfied that Ms Lang does not have an unused earning capacity that
needs to be taken into account in the assessment.
At the time the parties
separated she was not in the workforce. She found employment shortly after
separation in a role that allowed
her to care for the three children, before and
after school and during school holidays. She has recently taken a full-time job
has increased her income. It cannot be said that Ms Lang has reduced her
earnings with a view to affecting the amount of child support
that she might
receive, she has improved her position since separation.
tribunal is satisfied that Ms Lang’s income for the period to 31 August
2011 is reflected in her taxable incomes of $36,897
for the 2009/2010 financial
year and $33,507 for the 2010/2011 financial year. Since late August 2011, she
has been employed. The
tribunal is satisfied that her current salary is $40,000
per annum (in accordance with a payslip dated 6 September 2011). Although
Lang acknowledged she might occasionally work overtime, the tribunal considers
that she would also be entitled to claim some income
tax deductions which would
leave her current taxable income in the vicinity of $40,000 per
Lang also receives family tax benefit of about $100 per fortnight (folio B3) as
well as child support payments to assist with the
support of the children. Those
amounts cannot be considered as part of Ms Lang’s adjusted taxable income
(subparagraph 117(7A)(b)(ii)
of the Assessment Act).
Lang’s stated weekly household expenses of $1,270 (folio B8) and personal
expenditure of $80 (folio B7) do not exceed her
weekly income (although the
tribunal notes that her personal expenditure has increased as she is liable to
pay more tax on her increased
weekly expenses for the children are listed as $652 (folio B8). The tribunal
considers the listed expenses to be reasonable. They
include school fees of $300
per week. However, the tribunal notes they are likely to be understated as Ms
Lang has not allocated
any share of the rent, or motor vehicle costs apart from
fuel, in those expenses.
tribunal notes that those expenses, when combined with the costs Mr Lang meets,
give a total that is higher than the figures contained
in the Costs of Children
Table for 2011 that are part of the child support legislation. In that table the
total costs of three children,
aged under 13, where the parental income exceeds
$154,453 (after the deduction of self-support amounts) is $37,069. The higher
for Michael, Joseph and Karly are no doubt due in part to their private
school fees and the costs of the children’s special
needs which are not
factored into the table. The overall costs of the three children in this case
are in excess of $55,000 per annum.
Lang’s income and financial situation have been discussed at length above.
The tribunal finds that he has total current income
in the vicinity of $145,000
per annum and that his income is likely to increase at the end of
Lang’s Statement of Financial Circumstances form shows weekly household
expenses of $2,001 (folio A8) as well as personal
expenses of $1,846 (folio A7)
including child support of $630 per week. Whilst Mr Lang’s expenses exceed
his income, the tribunal
considers that Mr Lang has sufficient income and
resources to meet the necessary expenses he has to support himself and his
It notes that his personal credit card statements (folios A57 to A75)
show a high level of discretionary spending. He meets the whole
of the mortgage
on the property and all of the outgoings despite having a 50%
Lang stated that he does not share his expenses with Ms Walker and has borrowed
money from his parents in order to meet his expenses.
However, there is no
evidence to that affect apart from a statutory declaration from Mr Lang’s
mother, dated 4 August 2011,
concerning $40,000 loaned to him in 2008 to pay
legal fees, of which he has repaid $38,000 (folio A85). The tribunal notes that
Lang entered into a mortgage contract in 2010 and a verbal agreement that he
would be responsible for 100% of the mortgage payments,
in the knowledge that he
had a child support liability. Also, despite claiming to have expenses far in
excess of his income, the
tribunal notes Mr Lang’s vague responses as to
the attempts he has taken to economise. His bank and credit card statements
continued discretionary spending up to July 2011 (folio A35 and A75), including
a holiday in June 2011 after having completed
the Statement of Financial
Circumstances form in May 2011 (folio A1).
Ms Lang’s income since the end of August 2011 has been $40,000, the
tribunal proposes to increase the adjusted taxable income
used in the assessment
for her to that amount from the start of the following month, 1 September
Mr Lang’s adjusted taxable income at $145,000 and Ms Lang’s adjusted
taxable income at $40,000 will result in
an assessment of about $25,000 per
annum given a cost percentage of 26% for Karly and Joseph.
tribunal then considered payment of the children’s school fees. Were it
not for the medical and other costs being met by
Mr Lang, the tribunal would
have concluded that Mr Lang should be responsible for the majority of the school
fees because of his
higher income. However, as the medical costs for the
children seem likely to remain high for at least the next few years
(particularly
given the treatment required by Joseph and Michael), the tribunal
finds that Mr Lang should meet 50% of the costs of the children’s
school fees. That is $6,970 for 2011 and $8,000 for 2012.
considering Mr Lang’s income and financial resources, the tribunal does
not consider that it would cause him hardship
to be assessed to pay child
support liability proposed. The tribunal consider that this amount should be
increased to $150,000 from
1 January 2012 as Mr Lang has a record of pay
increases following a salary review. Although he is also required to meet the
costs of the children, the tribunal finds that the expenses incurred
would not impact the payment of child support at the level it
has determined.
After payment of tax, child support and the children’s medical costs, etc,
Mr Lang will have funds in excess
of $60,000 per annum.
Lang asked the tribunal to backdate its decision for the maximum period allowed
under the legislation, which is 18 months period
to the application for change
of assessment (subsection 98S(3B)). The tribunal noted that the application for
a change to the assessment
was initially brought by Ms Lang on 2 December 2010.
Mr Lang lodged a cross application. As the school fees were paid until the
part of 2010 following the property settlement and having regard to the
date of Ms Lang’s application for a change to the assessment,
the tribunal
proposes to commence the change from 1 October 2010, the start of the child
support period, shortly prior to Ms Lang’s
application. The change to Ms
Lang’s income should be made from 1 September 2011, shortly after she
changed employment. The
tribunal considers that the changes should extend until
31 December 2012 to allow both parents some certainty.
tribunal considers that the resulting child support payable should assist Ms
Lang to meet the necessary expenses that she incurs
in caring for the
Issue three – Is it otherwise proper to
depart from the administrative assessment?
final step for the tribunal to undertake is to determine whether it is
‘otherwise proper’
to depart from the administrative
assessment. Subsection 117(5) of the Assessment Act requires the tribunal to
take into consideration
the following matters:
(a) the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child (as stated in
section 3) and, in particular, the fact that it is the parents
themselves who have the primary duty to maintain the child;
(b) the effect that the making of the order would have
(i) any entitlement of the child, or the carer entitled to child support,
to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit; or
(ii) the rate of any income tested pension, allowance or benefit payable to
the child or the carer entitled to child support.
child support law recognises that each parent has a primary duty to maintain
their children.
Lang receives family tax benefit from Centrelink and an increase in the child
support paid by Mr Lang will reduce the cost to the
community. The tribunal is
satisfied that it is otherwise proper to depart from the administrative
assessment in this matter and
to properly reflect the financial circumstances of
both parents.
98S of the Assessment Act sets out the departure determinations that can be
made. Paragraph 98S(1)(a) provides that the Registrar
and the tribunal,
standing in place of the Registrar, may vary the annual rate of child support
payable by a parent. Paragraph 98S(1)(g)
provides that the adjusted taxable
income of a parent can be varied.
tribunal considers it appropriate to set both parent’s adjusted taxable
incomes and to increase the annual rate of child
support payable by Mr Lang to
reflect that Ms Lang is meeting the costs of the children’s education at a
private school.
The tribunal’s
On 26 September 2011, the tribunal decided to set aside the
decision under review and to substitute a new decision to:
Lang’s adjusted taxable income at $145,000 for the period from 1 October
2010 to 31 December 2011 and at $150,000 from
1 January 2012 to 31 December
Lang’s adjusted taxable income at $40,000 for the period 1 September 2011
to 31 December 2012; and
increase the
annual rate of child support payable by Mr Lang by $6,970 for the period 1
October 2010 to 31 December 2011 and by $8,000
for the period 1 January 2012 to
31 December 2012.
