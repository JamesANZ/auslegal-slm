Primary decision
[9] The primary
judge recorded that s 229 of the BCCM Act provided the only remedy for a
complex dispute was resolution by a specialist
adjudicator or an order of QCAT;
that a complex dispute was defined, relevantly, to mean a dispute mentioned in
s 149B of the BCCM
Act; that s 149B applied to a dispute about the
engagement of a person as a caretaking service contractor for a community title
that a caretaking service contractor was defined by s 6 of the BCCM
Act to mean a service contractor for the scheme who was also
a letting agent for
the scheme; and that by reason of ss 15 and 16 of the BCCM Act, the
applicant was both a service contractor and
a letting agent such that
resolution of the dispute was only available by a specialist adjudicator or
[10] The primary
judge recorded that the applicant contended that QCAT had no jurisdiction, as
QCAT did not have power to grant the
declaratory relief sought by the applicant
and that accordingly, there was jurisdiction to hearing the proceeding in the

QCAT was given original jurisdiction to determine
complex disputes, that

declaration
in such a case.
[12] The primary
judge also found that even if QCAT could not provide the remedy sought, it did
not follow that the District Court
had jurisdiction. The District Court was
itself a court of statutory jurisdiction and not a court of general
BCCM Act specified, the only remedy for a complex dispute
was a specialist adjudicator or QCAT, the subject matter of the proceeding
the District Court was excluded from the jurisdiction of the District
[13] Finally,
the primary judge found even if that not be so, the more specific provision in
the BCCM Act would be given effect by
the District Court over the general
provisions in
District Court of Queensland Act 1967
Consideration
[14] Section 229
of the BCCM Act provides:
Exclusivity of dispute
resolution provisions
(1) Subsections (2) and (3) apply to a dispute if it may be resolved under
this chapter by a dispute resolution process.
a dispute about a body corporate decision under section 47A, see
section 47AA.
disputes about a decision of a body corporate committee under section 410,
or a body corporate decision under section 411, see
section 412(5).
(2) The only remedy for a complex dispute
(a) the resolution of the dispute by—
(i) an order of a specialist adjudicator under chapter 6; or
(ii) an order of QCAT exercising the tribunal’s original jurisdiction
under the QCAT Act; or
(b) an order of the appeal tribunal on appeal from a specialist adjudicator or
QCAT on a question of law.
(3) Subject to section 229A, the only remedy for a dispute that is not a
complex dispute is—
(a) the resolution of the dispute by a dispute resolution process; or
(b) an order of the appeal tribunal on appeal from an adjudicator on a question
(4) However, subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to a dispute if—
(a) an application is made to the commissioner; and
(b) the commissioner dismisses the application under part 5.
(5) Also, subsections (2) and (3) do not limit—
(a) the powers of QCAT under the QCAT Act to—
(i) refer a question of law to the Court of Appeal; or
(ii) transfer a proceeding, or a part of a proceeding, to the Court of Appeal;
(b) the right of a party to make an appeal from QCAT to the Court of Appeal
under the QCAT Act.”
[15] It was not
in issue that the dispute between the applicant and the respondent was a complex
dispute. Accordingly, s 229 was
applicable. Its terms are clear and
unambiguous. The only remedy, in such a dispute, was by a specialist
adjudicator or QCAT, as
its original jurisdiction.
Henry J observed, in
Dunlop v Body Corporate for Port Douglas
Queenslander CTS 886 (No
“[62] While
s 149B(2) provides that a party to a dispute ‘may’ apply for an
order of a specialist adjudicator or
of QCAT, s 229 mandates the only
remedy for a complex dispute is such an order.
[63] The respondents do not argue against the obvious conclusion that
Mr Dunlop’s claim in contract against the body corporate
is a complex
dispute. However, they emphasise s 229(2) does not go to jurisdiction. They
submit, drawing on reasoning in
MHA v DMA 18
, that s 229(2)
‘potentially bars the remedy, not the right’, so that the objection
to jurisdiction is misplaced and that
if the applicants wish to maintain their
reliance upon the statutory bar to the remedy sought, they should do so in their
[64] However, the authorities relevant to s 229(2) indicate it is more than a
statutory bar to the remedy sought in the dispute and
that its effect is to
remove the court’s jurisdiction to resolve the dispute. As much was
concluded by Holmes J, as her Honour
then was, in
James v Body Corporate
Aarons Community Title Scheme 11476
. Her Honour observed of s 184(2) of
, the equivalent provision to what is now s 229(2) of that Act:
The wording of the section itself is unusual: rather than providing for
exclusive jurisdiction in so many words, s 184(2) speaks in
“the only remedy” being the order of an adjudicator or that of a
District Court on appeal on a question of law.
But those words ‘the only
remedy’ are not ambiguous; it is difficult to see what meaning they can
have other than that
in the circumstances to which s 184(2) applies, the only
manner in which the dispute itself can be resolved is by the means prescribed:
the adjudicator’s order or that of the District Court on
conclusion was not affected by the fact that only declaratory relief was sought
by the applicant. The clear legislative
intention of s 229 of the BCCM Act
was “to remove a court’s jurisdiction to resolve” a complex

no error in the primary judge’s conclusion that the District Court did not
have jurisdiction.

applicant pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.
I agree that leave to appeal should be refused for the reasons given by
Justice Boddice. Although the District Court judge set
out strong arguments in
favour of QCAT having power to make a declaration in a case such as the present,
it is unnecessary to presently
decide that question given the reasons outlined
by Justice Boddice.
