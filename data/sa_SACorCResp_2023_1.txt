COATS, Beverley Joy, WEST, Heather Maude and D'SOUZA, Lorna Margaret - Inquest Number 11/2022 (1448/2016, 0811/2017 & 1055/2019), Responses [2023] SACorCResp 1 (1 March 2023)
Coats, Beverley Joy and West, Heather Maude and D'Souza, Lorna Margaret (Coroner Kereru)
Recommendation 1
- That the current CALHN ACS
Pathway be amended to a) include a step immediately after the Initial ECG
requiring consideration of
other serious causes of chest pain such as aortic
dissection; and b) include the stipulation that a structured senior review
consider the possibility of other causes of chest pain and specifically
refer to aortic dissection.
Response from SA Health
recommendation has been accepted and the response incorporates actions by the
relevant Local Health Networks (LHNs) and state-wide
services, as detailed:
Central Adelaide
Local Health Network (CALHN) have amended their Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
Pathway in accordance with the Coroner’s
recommendation.
Metropolitan
hospitals are reviewing their local procedures, pathways and protocols to ensure
the consideration of other serious causes
of chest pain, such as aortic
dissection. These procedures include the plan for investigations and suspected
diagnosis to be reviewed
with the supervision of a senior clinician.
Women’s and Children’s Health Network (WCHN) are reviewing these
recommendations in relation to women and children.
Further discussion will be
undertaken with the Cardiac, Obstetrics and Paediatric clinical areas.
Support Service (RSS) plans to include these recommendations into the regional
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Pathway. The
pathway is managed by the Integrated
Cardiovascular Clinical Network South Australia (iCCnetSA) team. The regional
ACS Pathway currently
incorporates a structured, senior cardiologist review,
early in the pathway.
Recommendation 2
- That each Local Health Network in South Australia
consider where appropriate developing a regular education program regarding
dissection presentations and its diagnosis, having regard to the
recommendations in the paper by Professor Anne-Maree Kelly, ‘What
Done to Improve Diagnosis of Aortic Dissection’.
recommendation has been accepted and this SA Health report incorporates the
responses of the relevant LHNs and statewide services,
as detailed:
All SA Health
LHNs provide education sessions to their clinical staff about coronary artery
disease, heart failure and acute coronary
Education is
delivered in the following ways:
Medical Officer (RMO) rotational teaching program and General Practitioner (GP)
consultant program
presentations and recordings
Grand Round
presentations
newsletters, and on-line resources
emergency education sessions
Those sites that
do not currently include the diagnosis and management of aortic dissection are
in the process of developing training
resources to address this
specifically.
Ann-Maree Kelly’s paper on improving the diagnosis of aortic dissection
has been provided to all SA Health LHNs to
consider the recommendations in
review of their education programs.
