REASONS FOR DECISION
order that the Appeal Tribunal record is amended to reflect that the applicant
is D&W Republic Pty Ltd (‘DWR’).
Directions made 4 June 2025 the parties were required to address a preliminary
issue as to whether leave to appeal should be
granted. That is directed only to
questions of fact or mixed law and fact.
extent that a question of law alone is raised no leave to appeal is required.
However, if questions of fact and mixed law
and fact are raised leave to appeal
is required.
[4] A question
of law alone is one which can be stated and considered separately from the facts
with which it may be connected in
A question of fact involves
what occurred between the parties. A question of mixed law and fact requires a
question of fact to be
determined in order to decide a question of law.
[5] Leave to
appeal will usually be granted where there is a reasonable argument that the
decision is attended by error, and an appeal
is necessary to correct a
substantial injustice to the applicant caused by that error.
[6] If this
matter were to progress to the hearing of an appeal the various grounds would be
dealt with in the following way:
(a) If grounds of appeal raise questions of law alone, as well as questions of
fact or mixed law and fact, those grounds involving
questions of fact or mixed
law and fact will be dealt with first.
(b) If leave to appeal is granted then all grounds of appeal are dealt with on a
(c) If leave is not granted, then the questions of law will be
considered.
[7] DWR asserts
that some of its grounds are questions of law. Those grounds will be considered
later in this decision. It is important
that the grounds of appeal are correctly
characterised because the characterisation will determine if they are subject to
how an appeal will proceed.
Decision made 14 March 2025
Member below decided that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with
the dispute between the parties under the
Retail Shop Leases Act
(Qld) (‘RSLA’) because the applicant does not conduct a
retail business. The Member dismissed the application under
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
[9] The Member
found that DWR conducted a bar from the premises and that it utilised a
“ghost kitchen” for the provision
[10] The Member
concluded that a bar does not fall within the definition of a retail business as
defined in the RSLA and
Retail Shop Leases Regulation
(‘Regulation’).
[11] The Member
found that a restaurant is a retail business, but because other restaurants
provided food to the premises, which was
not prepared on site, and because the
sale of food was not a significant portion of the turnover of the business, it
could not be
said that DWR conducted a restaurant as its whole or predominant
activity, so as to fall within the definition of a retail business.
Applicant’s grounds of appeal
addresses error in a number of documents filed in the Appeal Tribunal. I have
relied principally on submissions filed on
23 July 2025 which were filed in
response to the Direction to address whether leave to appeal should be granted
in this matter.
[13] I note that
the other documents filed in the Appeal Tribunal canvass the same
[14] DWR submits
that it was an error of law to state the key issue for determination as whether
the whole or predominant use of the
premises was a bar, or a bar and
because the Member has
mis-stated the test by:
(a) referring to “use” of premises, when the Regulation refers to
its whole or predominant “activity”; and
(b) failing to apply the “predominant activity” test to the
“combination of the sale, hire or supply of goods or
services mentioned in
Schedule 1”, but instead applies that test to a “bar, or a bar and
restaurant”.
[15] The Member
has stated the issue for determination. The extract referred to by DWR is only
part of the paragraph where the Member
goes on to state why that issue needs to
be determined by findings of fact. I do not think the statement of factual
issues to be
determined raises a question of law alone and it cannot be turned
into a question of law by calling the statement a test and suggesting
have been re-worded and applied in a particular way.
[16] The ground
raised is not one which informs the question of whether there is a reasonably
arguable case on appeal because it does
not raise an error of law, fact or mixed
law and fact.
[17] DWR submits
that it was an error of law for the Member to state that “Schedule 1
refers to alcoholic beverages, but it
is only liquor trading for off premises
consumption which falls within the definition of a retail business, which does
not include
a bar.” DWR says that the Member mis-stated the test because
she did not refer to the
Liquor Act 1992
allowing service of meals and the
supply and sale of drinks.
[18] DWR seeks
to characterise a statement of fact as to what appears in sch 1 as a legal test,
which it is not. DWR then raises an
irrelevant issue. It is not to the point
that under a particular licence meals may be served with alcohol. The actual
food service
arrangements at the premises is to the point.
[19] The ground
does not raise an error of law alone. The purported ground of appeal is unlikely
to succeed as it is misconceived.
Ground three
[20] DWR submits
that an error of mixed fact and law occurred because the Member referred to the
submissions of the respondent Quinn
Kelk Pty Ltd (‘QK’) including
that the operation of a “ghost kitchen” does not constitute a
restaurant and
no meals were prepared from the premises. DWR says that the
“ghost kitchen” operated from day one of the lease.
[21] A statement
of QK’s submissions cannot raise an appealable
Ground four
[22] DWR submits
that an error of mixed fact and law occurred when the Member relied on
QK’s submissions that it was necessary
the predominant use of the premises
be a restaurant or café rather than the use being a secondary activity to
the use of the
premises as a bar. It is asserted the predominant use test is not
the appropriate test.
[23] This ground
is considered with ground five below.
Ground five
[24] DWR submits
that an error of law occurred by the Member applying a test that the business
mentioned in sch 1 needs to be the
whole or predominant activity of the business
and finding that the “ghost kitchen” was not the whole or
predominant activity.
latter two grounds of appeal go to the heart of DWR’s case. DWR submits
the Member misconstrued the legislation and
as a result found that the ghost
kitchen was not the whole or predominant activity carried out on the premises.
Despite the plain
of the Regulation, DWR submits that the section
does not require the whole or predominant activity of the leased premises to be
restaurant, for the business conduct there to comply with the requirements of
a retail business in
[26] The Member
has not sought to construe the definition of a retail business in
Regulation. The Member has simply set out the section in full.
[27] The Member
set out the statutory framework in deciding whether the Tribunal has
dispute between the parties.
She set out the facts which need to be determined. After making findings of fact
largely by reference
to the acknowledgements of DWR, the Member applied the
facts to the legislation and formed a conclusion that the matter is not a
lease dispute and there is no jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear the
confirmed that a “ghost kitchen” was used, that income from the
service of food was limited and that there was
no commercial kitchen on site,
although it was planned for succeeding years.
[29] In this
case I consider the words used in the RSLA bear their ordinary meaning and it is
reasonably open to hold that the facts
as found fall within those words.
Accordingly, the question of whether they do or not is a question of
[30] No question
of law alone arises in the grounds put by DWR. It is open to then consider
whether leave to appeal should be granted
by reference to these grounds.
[31] I do not
consider the grounds are reasonably arguable. The same process of reasoning was
Ozibar Pty Ltd v Laroar Holdings Pty Ltd
which applied the same
definition of a retail business. In that case McMeekin J was found that a
nightclub was not a business mentioned
in the schedule to the Regulation and
that even though food or coffee might be served in the nightclub, that could not
be the “whole or predominant” activity of a nightclub.
That service was merely incidental. Accordingly, the business
of a nightclub was
held not to be a retail business as defined, as the whole or predominant
activity of the business did not fall
within any business described in the
schedule to the Regulation. By analogy the same conclusion can be reached in
this matter.
[32] DWR submits
that it was an error of law to decide that the matter should be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction, because the RSLA
is intended to protect small businesses
and that nothing in the RSLA caused the bar conducted by DWR to be excluded at
law from application
of the RSLA’s provisions.
[33] Stating an
objection to the outcome does not of itself raise an error of law, fact or mixed
law and fact. I do not think it is
reasonably arguable that even though the
business of a bar is not mentioned in Schedule 1, one can nevertheless conclude
is a retail business and that the dispute resolution provisions of the
RSLA apply just because it is a small business. I adopt the
conclusion of
McMeekin J in
’s case that sch 1 is
restrictive.
[34] Finally,
DWR submits that it was an error of law not to agree to an expert conclave.
Further, that it was an error of law not
to allow eye-witness evidence as to the
actual service of meals by the “ghost kitchen” arrangements in year
own submissions to the Member below, and in the appeal submissions, confirm that
the service of food was not the
whole or predominant activity of the business.
The Member below did not doubt that food was served at the bar. There was no
for evidence on that point.
[36] As to an
expert’s conclave I understand that to relate to engineering evidence as
to problems with the roof of the premises.
That evidence may have been relevant
in dispute resolution proceedings before the Tribunal if the Tribunal had
matter. Until that threshold hurdle was overcome the
evidence was premature.
[37] In any
event, the admission of evidence does not raise solely a question of law on an
[38] The ground
of appeal has poor prospects of success.
Consideration
[39] Overall,
I conclude that there is no reasonably arguable case of error in the decision
[40] In the
absence of arguable error, I do not consider that leave is needed to correct a
substantial injustice.
[41] DWR has not
raised an error of law alone which should proceed to a hearing.
[42] For these
reasons the application for leave to appeal or appeal is dismissed.
[43] Although it
has not informed my decision in this matter, I note that DWR is not left without
legal recourse. QK raises in its
submissions that the business is no longer
conducted by DWR and that there are currently Supreme Court proceedings on foot
the parties in which DWR may raise any matter which is sought to be
raised in this Tribunal.
[44] As a result
of this order the other interlocutory applications currently before the Appeal
Tribunal are dismissed.
Reasons for decision refusing a stay
4 June 2025 the Appeal Tribunal decided that an application by DWR for a stay of
the decision below is refused. Reasons for
that decision have been sought.
[46] A stay of
the decision that the application is dismissed for want of jurisdiction is not a
decision capable of being stayed.
The decision creates no rights capable of
being stayed. DWR hopes by use of a stay to give jurisdiction to the Tribunal
has been found not to exist. That is misconceived. A finding that the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction is analogous to a declaration
by the Tribunal. The
Courts have determined that applications to stay a declaration should be refused
due to the logic that there
is nothing about a declaratory order that can be
For those reasons the
application to stay the decision below is refused.
