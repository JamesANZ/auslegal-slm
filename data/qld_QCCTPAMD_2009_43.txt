REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is a decision in a disciplinary proceeding brought by the Chief Executive of the
Office of Fair Trading against the respondent,
Karen Barkhuysen. At the hearing
Mr Danen appeared for the Chief Executive. There was no appearance by or on
behalf of the respondent.
I am satisfied that the respondent was given due
notice of the date, time and venue of the hearing and, at the request of Mr
I proceeded to hear and determine the proceeding in the absence of the
respondent, pursuant to
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal
(“CCT Act”).
the proceeding commenced, the Chief Executive put forward three disciplinary
charges against the respondent. An amended application
was filed on 26 May
2008, setting out two disciplinary charges. At the hearing Mr Danen informed
the Tribunal that of the disciplinary
charges previously made the Chief
Executive was persisting only with disciplinary charge 2, which is that the
respondent has, in
carrying on a business or performing an activity had been
incompetent or acted in an unprofessional way within the meaning of
section 496
(g)(iii) of the
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
Act”). Mr Danen also explained that the Chief Executive did not contend
that the respondent had been incompetent,
but rather that she had acted in an
unprofessional way.
Relevant facts
particulars of the conduct are set out in annexure B to the amended application.
In brief the relevant facts are set out below.
respondent held a real estate agents licence between 23 December 2003 and 1 June
2007. The respondent was also a director of
a licensed real estate corporation,
known as Queensland Commercial Real Estate Pty Ltd (“QCRE”). QCRE
held a real estate
corporation licence between 20 September 2003 and 20
September 2006; during the whole of this period the respondent was the director
of QCRE and was the only director holding a real estate agents licence.
respondent on behalf of QCRE gave notice to the Chief Executive of the
company’s intention to open and operate a trust account.
account was opened on 28 June 2004. I am satisfied, on the basis of the
evidence, produced in the statement of Robert
Harold Golightly and its
attachments, that the trust account was opened and operated by QCRE pursuant to
the obligations imposed
under the Act during the period from 1 June 2004 to 1
am also satisfied, on the basis of the certificate under
section 375
and the statement of Tracey Anne Tedmanson, that QCRE failed to lodge an audit
report with the Chief Executive for the
periods 28 June 2004 to 28 May 2005, 1
June 2005 to 31 May 2006 and 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2008.
stopped being a licensee on 20 September 2006, but failed to lodge a final audit
report with the Chief Executive in respect of
its trading during the period 1
June 2006 to 20 September 2006.
failings on the part of QCRE were breaches of
section 402(2)
section 406(2)
of the Act.
Chief Executive’s case is that the conduct of the respondent as a licensee
and as a director of a licensed real estate corporation,
in failing to ensure
that the corporation lodged the audit reports required by the Act, was
unprofessional conduct in that it fell
substantially below the standard of
conduct expected by licensees in the industry.
the respondent is a former licensee the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with
disciplinary charges pursuant to
section 450
of the Act. That provision confers
on the Tribunal jurisdiction to hear and decide disciplinary matters involving
Section 447
of the Act defines “licensee” relevantly to
include a former licensee who held a licence under the Act at anytime within
three years before the proceeding was started. The respondent is such a former
Standard of conduct
the importance attached to compliance with the Act’s obligations about
trust accounts, including the auditing of trust
accounts, it is clear to me that
the standard of conduct that would ordinarily be expected of a licensee in the
industry, where the
licensee was the sole licensed director of a licensed real
estate corporation, would be that the licensee would cause the licensed
corporation to comply with its obligations to lodge audit reports with the Chief
Executive in accordance with the Act.
is possible that a failure to ensure a corporation lodged an audit report could
be characterised as accidental or a minor oversight;
so that the conduct may not
fall substantially below the expected standard. However, where the licensee has
failed to ensure that
the corporation lodged three annual reports and then the
final audit report expected when it ceased to have a licence, that pattern
conduct certainly falls substantially below the standard of conduct expected by
licensees in the industry. For those reasons
I am satisfied that grounds exist
for starting disciplinary proceedings against the respondent.
Matters relevant to penalty
purpose of the penalty is to protect consumers and other participants in the
industry from unprofessional conduct such as that
I have found in this case.
The lodging of annual audit reports and the lodging of a final audit report are
a significant part of
the inventory of consumer protection measures contained in
the Act. The pattern of conduct occurring here, where the respondent
to cause the licensed corporation to comply with those obligations at all during
the period it held a licence, is a serious
to the applicant’s submissions the respondent has not been the subject of
any previous disciplinary proceedings, offences
or other charges relevant to
this matter. Nor has the Chief Executive alleged that any consumer has suffered
any loss arising from
the facts relied upon to bring this disciplinary
proceeding. I accept that those are mitigating factors in terms of the
of a penalty.
range of orders open to the Tribunal in a disciplinary proceeding may be found
section 529
of the Act. The Chief Executive seeks the imposition of a
penalty in the range of $1,000-$1,500.00 (or 10 – 15 penalty units).
maximum fine that may be imposed is 200 penalty units.
the circumstances I am satisfied that an appropriate penalty is payment of a
fine of $1,500.00. I will also order that the respondent
pay the Chief
Executive’s costs fixed at $250.00. The fine and the costs are to be paid
within three months.
