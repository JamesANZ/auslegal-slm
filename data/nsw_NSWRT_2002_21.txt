APPLICATION
APPEARANCES
: Mr Williams on behalf of all applicants
apart from Mr Penmead; The latter applicant being represented by Mr
The park owner Mr George Briffa, in person.
: 8 October 2001 at Ballina and view of Residential
Parks on 16 October 2001
FINDINGS AND ORDERS
The Tribunal having heard evidence of the parties on 8 October 2001 and
viewed comparable residential parks on 16 October 2001 now
makes the following
findings and orders:
Each applicant occupies a site within
Ballina Pacific Palms upon which is located the applicants’ homes. The
agreement between
the applicant and respondent is a "residential site agreement"
to which the
Residential Parks Act 1998
On 1 July 2001 Ballina Shire Council
introduced a ‘user pays’ system for water consumption under which a
charge of 0.70
cents per Kilolitre for the first 350 Kilolitres consumed and
thereafter 0.90 cents per Kilolitre was applied.
The park owner commenced charging
residents of the park for the metered amount of water consumed from July 2001.
In doing so, the
park owner charged each resident 0.70 cents for the first 6
kilolitres consumed and 0.90 cents per kilolitre thereafter. This represents
pro rata sharing of the first 350 kilolitres amongst the residents.
The applicants claimed that the
introduction of a charge, which on average was $1.50 per week, for a service
which had until that
time been included as part of the site rental of $76.00 per
week, was a reduction in the services previously provided by the Park
Accordingly, the applicants claimed a rental reduction under
section 56(3)
By virtue of
of the Act it is
a term of each of the applicant’s residential site agreements that they
pay all water consumption charges
, inter alia
, that there is no
minimum charge and that the resident pay the same amount as they would if a
direct domestic customer of Ballina
Shire Council.
The Park Owner has not complied with
section 39(2)(a)
of the Act. Each of the applicants was not charged an amount
of 0.70 cents per kilolitre for the first 350 kilolitres of water consumed
that particular site each year. That the park owner only received one
allocation of water at the lower tariff is irrelevant under
section 39(2)(a).
The result of the unusual method of charging for water consumption adopted by
Ballina Shire Council is that the park owner cannot
recover the full cost of his
supplying water to resident of the park.
The park owner must refund, or credit,
each applicant with 20 cents per kilolitre for each kilolitre of water for which
the resident
was charged 0.90 cents from 1 July 2001. The park owner must
charge each applicant the amount of 0.70 cents for each kilolitre of
consumed until the amount consumed by that resident exceeds 350 kilolitres in
the particular billing year.
Section 56(3)
of the Act states that the
introduction of a charge of water consumption, where no such charge had been
made previously, does not
of itself meant that the rent has become excessive.
It is necessary to consider the relevant
of the Act in determining if the rent is excessive as a
consequence. In this case, the parties relied upon a number of residential
parks as comparable to Ballina Pacific Palms. These were Lakeside at Ballina,
Shahdaroba at Evans Head and Sanctuary Village at
Lennox Head.
These residential parks and Ballina
Pacific Palms were inspected with Mr Briffa and Mr Deede on 16 October 2001.
Shahdaroba Village is not regarded as
comparable to Pacific Palms as it is in a separate locality some distance from
Ballina and is
in a rural isolated setting whilst Pacific Palms is within the
town of Ballina.
Lakeside Village is located on Shaws Bay
Ballina. Site fees for permanent residents are $77.00 per week including water.
has an extensive array of facilities provided for residents, which far
exceed the facilities available at Pacific Palms. It is also
in a superior
location by reason of its proximity to beach and bay. However, it lacks the
convenient location of Pacific Palms to
shops and town centre.
Lakeside is predominantly a tourist park with only a small
number of permanent residents. Pacific Palms is entirely occupied by permanent
residents. For these reasons the Tribunal is of the view that the two parks are
not entirely comparable.
Sanctuary Village is most comparable to
Pacific Palms of the parks inspected. It is occupied by permanent residents. It
a rural setting on the fringe of Lennox Head and does not enjoy the
proximity to shops as does Pacific Palms. However, it has a
more extensive
array of facilities than does Pacific Palms. In the Tribunal’s view, the
bushland setting and range of facilities
at Sanctuary Village offsets the more
convenient location of Pacific Palms.
Site fees at the date
of inspection were $79.80 per week including water.
Comparing the site fees of $79.80 per
week payable at Sanctuary Village with those payable at Pacific Palms of $76.00
per week, plus
water charges averaging $1.50 to $2.00 per week to make a total
of $77.50 to $78.00 per week, the Tribunal is not satisfied that
introduction of a charge for water usage has resulted in the site fees at
Pacific Palms being excessive.
These figures for Pacific
Palms are slightly higher than for permanent site fees at Lakeside. The
Tribunal is of the view that this
difference is not significant having regard to
the differing resident population of each Village and the site fees payable at
more comparable park, Sanctuary Village.
The Park Owner is to charge the
applicants for water consumption in accordance with
section 39(2)(a)
Residential Parks Act 1998
. The effect of this order being that at the
date of hearing the applicants were required to pay 0.70cents per kilolitre for
first 350 kilolitres consumed on each site during the annual billing period
and 0.90 cents per kilolitre for each additional kilolitre
consumed during the
annual billing period.
The park owner is to refund, or credit,
the individual applicant’s water consumption account with the amount
representing the
difference between the amount actually charged for water
consumption and that which should have been charged under order 1 above.
amount is to be refunded or credited within 28 days of the date of these orders.
The application for an order that the
site fee of $76.00 per week payable by the applicants at the residential park is
now excessive
because of the introduction of a separate charge for water
consumption is dismissed.
