Mr G C Lalor, Deputy President
By Application filed
on 19 October 2006 the ACT Medical Board sought a declaration under Section
64(1)(l) that a person who had
been a registered medical practitioner in the
�is a person who, if he were registered as a medical practitioner
under the Act, would have been found by the Tribunal to have contravened
required standard of practice for persons registered as medical practitioners
and/or would not satisfy the suitability to practise
requirements for medical
practitioners�.
The application was
brought under Section 46A(2) of the
Health Professionals Act 2004
I listed a directions
hearing in the matter with the consent of the parties on 8 November 2006 and
gave certain directions for progressing
the matter to hearing.
This hearing was conducted with Counsel for
the applicant participating from Melbourne by telephone.
By letter dated 6
November 2006 the Solicitors for the respondent advised that application was
made on his behalf for an order pursuant
to Section 53 of the Act
sensitivity of the matter�
to have his name suppressed.
The letter set out the grounds for such an
application in the following terms:
client retired from all surgical practice in April 2002 and retired from all
clinical practice and medico legal peer work
in June 2004, we submit that there
is no public interest in disclosure of the
our client�s identity
and the circumstances of this application.
however, a real possibility of serious disadvantage to our client if this
matter is to be heard in a public hearing.
Our client has been the subject of ongoing media scrutiny and the
publication of his name will lead to further embarrassment and
harassment and
might adversely affect his ability to give evidence in a fair manner.�

Counsel for the
applicant indicated that she was not in a position to contest the application
as were her instructions that day.
instructing solicitors had, by letter dated 8 November 2006, advised the
applicant�s solicitors that they were instructed to

I listed the application

��������������������
This matter is to be

On 5 December Mr Crowe SC appeared for
the applicant and Ms Hinchey for the respondent to this application.
Mr Crowe had not appeared in the Directions
Hearing of 8 November.
Mr Crowe put the
background of the matter before me.
This is also set out in the original application and is as follows:
�Raymond Leonard George
Newcombe was first registered as a medical practitioner in the ACT under the
Practitioners Act 1930
) on 4 February1975.
continued as such a practitioner until his registration was cancelled on 17
December 2004, following his failure to pay the annual
registration fee.
Dr Newcombe has not been registered to
practise in the ACT since that date.
On 29 March 2004, prior
to the cancellation of his registration, the Medical Board established under
the MPA had commenced an Inquiry
under s 42 of the MPA to determine whether Dr
Newcombe had been guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional
in respect of his treatment of certain patients including:
Richard Ord;
Helen Langham; and
Tracey De Jong.
Inquiry was extended on 21 October 2004 to include consideration of Dr
Newcombe�s treatment of:
Gordon Silk.
Inquiry had not been completed on 7 July 2005 when the MPA was repealed.
Pursuant to
s 140 of the Act, the newly established Board treated the Inquiry undertaken by
the previous Board as a report made
to it under the
Health Professionals
As required by s 86 of
the Act, the Medical Board has consulted with the Commissioner for Health
Complaints.
The Board and the
Commissioner have agreed that an application should be made to the Tribunal for
a declaration under s 64(1)(l)
of the Act on the basis of Dr Newcombe�s
treatment of each of the patients listed above.�
The Medical Board of
the Australian Capital Territory through its Chairman following a hearing on 7
April 2004 made orders in the
following terms on 29 June 2004:
now the Board orders
that until further direction of the Board, pursuant to
section 26 of the
Health Professions Board (Procedures) Act 1981
publication to third parties other than the Registrar and members of the Board
the name of Dr Newcombe in connection with this
Inquiry; and
all evidence given before the Board, whether in public
or in private, or of matters contained in documents lodged with the Board
received in evidence by the Board,
prohibited, except where it is necessary for Dr Newcombe�s legal
representatives, counsel assisting the Board or the Registrar
of the Board to
communicate, disclose or otherwise make known the name of Dr Newcombe in
connection with the preparation of the
hearing of this Inquiry.�
�����������
Counsel for the
applicant put before me a copy of an order dated 7 May 2004 given by the
President of the Australian Capital Territory
Administrative Appeals Tribunal
in the following terms:
satisfied that it is desirable to do so, pursuant to section 34 of the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1989, the Tribunal:
restricts the disclosure of the name of the applicant
or anything that would identify the applicant, to the parties to the
proceedings
and to a member, or a member of staff, of the Tribunal in the
course of his or her duties;
prohibits the publication of the name of the applicant
in any published record or public account of the proceedings in this matter,
including any public listing of proceedings in connection with this matter; and
directs that the applicant be described as �Re: Medical
Practitioner� in all documents and in all proceedings in this matter.
This order applies until further order.�
That order arose from
an application by the applicant in this matter to review a decision of the
Medical Board given on 7 April
2004 to suspend his registration pending the
holding of its enquiry into the allegations made against him.
On 21 June 2004 the President made orders by
consent relating to this suspension.
The order of 7 May 2004 remained effective in those proceedings.
Senior Counsel for the
applicant further foreshadowed an application to be made under Section 58 of
the Act at a later date.
application is to be made on the basis that the application of 19 October 2006
�frivolous or vexatious�
and should be struck out.
He indicated that the application for the
order under Section 53 was for an extension of the order I made on 8 November
Counsel tendered reports from
medical professionals being:
Gavan M Carney
Katherine Lubbe
And reports
from Mr Tom Sutton, a Fellow of the Australian College of Clinical
Psychologists.
In effect those reports
indicate that the applicant is suffering from significant health issues and
they are deteriorating with
no immediate prospect of improving.
His mental state is such that it is opined
that it would be unwise for the applicant to be
�involved in legal
proceedings at present because I doubt his current ability to concentrate and
to follow such proceedings for
long periods�.
Senior Counsel for the applicant
specifically resiled from the grounds for the application set out in the letter
of 6 November 2006.
He indicated that
he was not asking that the application be granted on the basis that it was
in the public interest�
but rather that it was
�desirable in the
interests of justice�
to make the order sought.
As I understand the submission it was put that the publication of
the applicant�s name would cause his physical and mental health
to deteriorate
further and given the state of his health and the prognoses contained in the
reports, it was unlikely that he would
be physically or mentally able to
participate in legal proceedings of the nature contemplated.
Given, so the submission was put, that the
matter might not proceed it was not in the interests of justice to decline to
order sought.
Senior Counsel
sought an order until the application for an order under Section 58 of the Act
was dealt with.
�����������
Counsel for the
respondent to this application relied upon written submissions prepared jointly
with Senior Counsel.
The law in this area is
well settled.
The fundamental rule of
our system of justice is that proceedings of a judicial nature are to be held
in a Court open to public
access with access to the press and freedom to report
proceedings.
Barwick CJ in the matter
Russell-v-Russell
[1976] 134 C.L.R. 495
expressed the general rule as:
statute requires the court to sit in a place open to the public but, none the
less, it is of the essence of the State
system of courts that, unless
authorized by statute, the place where a State court sits to exercise its
to the public.
Certain discretions are given to the State courts to exclude members of
the public from the proceedings in certain circumstances.
That very existence of a statutory
discretion is emphatic that in general the court during the hearing of a matter
is to be open
to the public.�
The legislature for the
Australian Capital Territory has recognized this fundamental rule of our
justice system in its legislation
under the Act in question.
Section 52 sets out the basic tenet that
hearings must be in public subject to the exception that an order may be made
under Section
The circumstances
under which this exception is to be exercised are narrow in their
expression.
The relevant circumstance
here is that such an exception must be
�in the interests of justice�.
The seminal case in
this area is that of the House of Lords of
Scott-v-Scott
as cited to me by both Counsel.
The most cited passage from it is from Lord Haldane at p 438 where he
burden lies on those seeking to displace its application in the particular case
to make out that the ordinary rule must
as of necessity be superseded by this
paramount consideration�
������������
case he must satisfy the Court that by nothing short of the exclusion of the
public can justice be done.
consideration that the evidence is of an unsavoury character is not enough, any
more than it would be in a criminal court,
and still less is it enough that the
parties agree in being reluctant to have their cases tried with open doors.
And at page 439:
�A mere desire to consider
feelings of delicacy or to exclude from publicity details which it would be
desirable not to publish
is not, I repeat, enough as the law now stands.�
�����������
Following cases
have all stated that it is only in
�exceptional cases�
of justice would ordinarily override the ordinary requirement of open justice�
SRD-v-Australian Securities Commission and Another
[1994] FCA 1252
123 ALR 730
per Hill J at 732
�it has been said that the circumstances which warrant a private hearing are
incapable of definition�
R-v-Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies;
Ex parte New Cross Building Society (
1984) Q.B. 227
As I have stated above
the exceptional matters put before me, as I see them, are that proceedings such
as those brought in this
original application are likely to heighten the
applicant�s anxiety and diminish his capacity to properly make decisions
the conduct of his case.
none of the correspondence from those treating him is it said that the
publication of his name will cause him physical or mental
It is the continuation of these proceedings
that is the subject of the reports.
I note in passing that
I was informed from the Bar Table that one of the patients the subject of this
original application has brought
a civil action against the applicant arising
from the alleged conduct that is part of the matters to be led in the hearing
original application.
further informed that the applicant has not applied in those proceedings to
have his name suppressed.
This is not
determinative of this matter but it is indicative that it appears that the
effect sought to be avoided in these proceedings
is not thought to be relevant
to the civil proceedings.
In the circumstances I
am unable to find that in the interests of justice in this matter
the ordinary requirement of open justice�
Accordingly I discharge the order I made on 8 November 2006.
I certify that this and the 5
pages are a true copy of the
and reasons for decision herein
