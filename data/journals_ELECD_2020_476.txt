Abstract/Description:
The Conclusion provides a general critical overview on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). While recognizing the multifaceted dimensions
of the BRI and its amorphous nature, the chapter discusses the BRI as a strategy; but again it is a hybrid strategy that lacks a
grand design and in which the central Chinese state often lacks control over its economic actors abroad. After describing a possible
clash of norms that define the future global governance between China’s BRI and Europe and other liberal countries, the Conclusion
provides some policy recommendations on how to engage with the BRI in order to commonly shape the future structures of global governance.
