G Woolcock Registrar M Finlay
BACKGROUND:
building at 68 Dargile Circuit, Epping (
Subject Land
) is a single storey
brick veneer dwelling currently under construction.
Victorian Building Authority (
) conducted a proactive inspection of
the Subject Land on 7 April 2025.
VBA issued a report requiring the Applicant to provide evidence/confirmation
that sill and head flashings are not required to
be installed to any of the
windows in accordance with the minimum requirements of cl 5.7.4 of the
Housing Provisions Standard 2022
APPLICANT’S PROPOSAL
Applicant proposes to apply Sealit multipurpose waterproofing compound to
external brick walls in lieu of installing sill and
head flashings to the
as-built window openings.
addition, the Applicant proposes to apply Crommelin Hybrid MS Polyurethane
Sealant to fill gaps between window openings and external
walls, in lieu of
installing sill and head flashings to the as-built windows.
Applicant maintains that the application of these two waterproofing products to
external brick walls and around window openings,
to the manufacturers’
specifications, will provide a weatherproof barrier to prevent moisture ingress
from around external
window frames.
are not persuaded that the Applicant’s proposal addresses the performance
requirements of cl 5.7.4(3) of the HPS 2022, which
is designed to ensure proper
water drainage and to prevent water ingress into the wall cavity.
is provided in cl 5.7.4(3) ensures that water is directed away from openings to
prevent moisture damage to the building by returning
flashings into the wall
cavity, fixing head flashings to window frames and embedding sill flashings into
head and sill flashings, installed correctly, are robust and designed to direct
water away from the wall cavity and out of
the building structure.
find that the Applicant’s proposal will not ensure proper water drainage
but has the potential to seal moisture into cavity
areas of the building, as
water ingress may occur via areas other than from brick wall penetration or from
gaps around window frames.
Water ingress to the wall cavity may be from
roof or gutter areas, for instance.
are of the opinion that wall opening flashings as per the HPS 2022
robust and effective measure to prevent the retention of moisture within the
fabric of a building, and their installation is
a well-known mandatory
requirement for best building practice.
