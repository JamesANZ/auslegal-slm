INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
20 December 2024
REASONS FOR DECISION
application for external review arises from a decision made by the Western
Australian Local Government Association (
) to refuse Peter Walker
the complainant
) access to documents under the
Information Act 1992
the FOI Act
4 February 2023, the complaint contacted WALGA seeking the contact details for
WALGA’s FOI officer.
13 February 2023, WALGA replied stating:
We do not have an FOI
Officer at WALGA, rather a Governance Team.
If you are seeking information from your local council, please see the link
Submit a Freedom of Information (FOI) access application | Western Australian
Government (www.wa.gov.au)
seems the complainant then made several other approaches to WALGA by phone and
email in relation to his request.
Ultimately,
on 24 February 2023, the complainant sought to make an ‘FOI request’
to WALGA in the following terms:
My FOI request is:
WALGA the trustee of the Local government House Trust?
there any other trustees?
WALGA provide reports to local councils that are not listed on the WALGA
so, what reports?
provide a copy of WALGA quarterly report for Q4 2019.
provide a copy of the audit report for the Local Government House Trust for the
fy 2021/2022.
many Unit Holders are there in the Local Government House Trust.
most relevance to the access provisions of the FOI Act and to this office is the
part of the request seeking access to specifically
described documents at items
5 and 6 in the list above (
requested documents
27 February 2023, WALGA advised the complainant that the requested documents
were considered confidential between relevant parties
to those documents and
that ‘WALGA is a not for profit incorporated Association and not a
Government agency’. WALGA did
not specifically state that it refused
access to the requested documents or whether it accepted, or did not accept,
that it is an
agency that is subject to the FOI Act.
28 February 2023 the complainant wrote to my office requesting external review
of WALGA’s decision (
application for external review
REVIEW BY THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
letter dated 21 March 2023, I wrote to WALGA:
that I had received an application for external review in this matter but was
yet to formally decide whether to deal with
the application as a complaint under
section 65 of the FOI Act against a decision of WALGA;
that, based on the information then before me, I was inclined to proceed on the
basis that the complainant had made an access
application under the FOI Act and
that WALGA has made a decision under the FOI Act to refuse to deal with the
complainant’s
application for access to the requested documents;
information from WALGA as to whether it accepts or disputes that it is an agency
under the FOI Act; and
requesting,
in the event that WALGA disputed that it is an agency under the FOI Act, that
WALGA provide me with written submissions
in support of that
letter dated 18 April 2023, WALGA stated that it ‘wish[ed] to advise that
WALGA accepts that it is a ‘public body’
and therefore subject to
the application of the FOI Act.’ WALGA did not provide any substantive
submissions in support of
its position, including in relation to several
specific issues on which I invited its submissions. It advised that, in
to the complainant’s request:
[O]ur aim was to
provide Mr Walker access to the information requested to the extent
We provided Mr Walker with information regarding the purpose of the Local
Government House Trust (‘the Trust’), however
were unable to provide
Mr Walker with the documents requested as they pertain to commercial information
and are therefore commercial
in confidence.
letter dated 23 November 2023, I advised the parties that, following receipt of
WALGA’s 18 April 2023 letter, I had given
careful consideration to whether
I should, in the circumstances, proceed on the basis that WALGA is an agency
under the FOI Act and
that I have jurisdiction to deal with the application for
external review. I summarised the conclusions of some relevant preliminary
research carried out by my legal staff and stated that, notwithstanding
WALGA’s apparent acceptance that it is an agency under
the FOI Act, I was
not persuaded that there was sufficient information before me to proceed on the
basis that WALGA is an agency
under the FOI Act and that I have jurisdiction to
deal with this application for external review.
advised the parties that, in the circumstances, I considered it necessary to
make a formal determination as to whether or not WALGA
is an agency under the
FOI Act, following a proper consideration of all the material before me
including consideration of further
submissions from the parties.
did not provide any substantive submissions in response to my 23 November 2023
letter. Instead, by letter dated 16 January
2024, WALGA advised me
[f]ollowing a review of your letters, I wish to advise that
WALGA does not hold a firm view on the issue of whether or not WALGA is
agency, as defined in the Glossary to the
Freedom of Information Act 1992
(FOI Act), and therefore subject to the application of the FOI Act.
WALGA will respect the Commissioner’s decision about the matter.
did not receive a reply from the complainant in response to my request for
submissions but the complainant made some brief submissions
in his application
for external review (
complainant’s submissions
WALGA AN ‘AGENCY’ FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE FOI ACT?
question for my determination is whether WALGA is an ‘agency’ as
defined in the Glossary to the FOI Act.
complainant submits that WALGA is an agency. As noted above, WALGA’s
position is that it does not hold a firm view on the
matter and will abide my
decision as to whether or not it is an agency. I consider that for me to
exercise my statutory powers and
functions, I must be satisfied that the entity
in question is, in fact, an agency for the purposes of the FOI Act.
3(1) of the FOI Act states:
The objects of this Act are to
(a) enable the public to participate more effectively in governing the State;
(b) make the persons and bodies that are responsible for State and local
government more accountable to the public.
10 of the FOI Act creates a right for a person to be given access to the
documents of an agency (other than an exempt agency)
subject to and in
accordance with the FOI Act.
WALGA is not an agency within the meaning of the FOI Act, then the FOI Act does
not apply and the complainant has no right of access
to the requested documents
under the FOI Act.
term ‘agency’ is defined in the Glossary to the FOI Act to
(a) a Minister; or
(b) a public body or office.
Glossary further defines ‘public body or office’ to mean:
(a) a department of the Public Service;
(b) an organization specified in column 2 of Schedule 2 to the
Public Sector

(c) the Police Force of Western Australia;
(d) a local government or a regional local government;
(e) a body or office that is established for a public purpose under a written

(g) any other body or office that is declared by the regulations to be a public

(i) a body or office established under a written law; or
(ii) a corporation or association over which control can be exercised by the
State, a Minister, a body referred to in paragraph (a),

be an ‘agency’ for the purposes of the FOI Act, WALGA must come
within one of the categories in paragraphs (a)–(h)
of the definition of

in the circumstances of this
matter, the only category which could apply is

local government councils in WA and is a unit trust
with units held by councils
(approx. 620 units) as beneficiaries. The trust deed has been amended to
ensure the LGHT is considered
a state/territory body (STB) for tax
purposes. WALGA is the trustee of the LGHT and have confirmed the
unitholders.
WALGA’s submissions

status as an agency under the FOI Act and stated
it would abide my determination

Consideration
to the interpretation of the definition of a ‘body or office that is
established for a public purpose under a written
law’ in paragraph (e) is
contained in
Channel 31 Community Educational Television Ltd v Inglis
[2001] WASCA 405
), in which Hasluck J
[I]t is not simply a question of whether there is a written
law... which enables the body to function. The crucial question is whether
establishment of the body and the public purpose for which it exists is
explicitly referable to and carried into effect by or
pursuant to a written
that case, the body under consideration, Channel 31, was a company limited by
guarantee and registered under the
Corporations (Western Australia) Act
. It had been issued a licence relating to community broadcasting under
Broadcasting Services Act 1992
(Cth). By its memorandum and
articles, the objects of Channel 31’s establishment were stated to be
public educational purposes,
not private commercial purposes. Channel 31
established and operated a broad-based community television station with active
participation. Furthermore, benefits flowed to the relevant tertiary
institutions associated with Channel 31, those tertiary institutions
themselves established for public purposes. However, none of these
characteristics were determined by the enabling legislation.
Ultimately, the
Supreme Court of Western Australia found that Channel 31 was not a body
‘established for a public purpose under
It is apparent from
, that the objects of the [FOI Act]
are to be achieved by creating a general right of access to State and local
government documents.
The right of access is constituted by
in respect of
the documents of an agency...
The provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act
do not suggest that
institutions other than governmental agencies are required to provide access to
their records, and indeed the
contrary is suggested by the way in which the
objects of the Act are confined to agencies involved in the process of
government.
Channel 31 has no
special or regulatory powers conferred upon it
by a particular statute or written law
and I am therefore not satisfied that
it can be characterized as a body “established for a public purpose under
a written law.”
J also reviewed the case law and gave consideration to the characteristics of
‘public purposes.’ His Honour stated:
[I]f the powers
available to a body by its domestic constitution are no greater than those
available to an individual and have not
been specially conferred by government,
then, consistently with the reasoning in [
Renmark Hotel Inc v Federal
Commissioner of Taxation
(1949) 79 CLR 11
would be a basis for concluding that the body did not have a public purpose.
Such a conclusion would be further reinforced
if it were apparent that the
government or electors played no part in the appointment of the governing
committee. The
(supra) case shows that this conclusion is not
displaced by the fact that the body in question is not a profit making
and confers benefits upon the
Honour included the following quote from
characteristics of a public authority seem to be that it should carry on some
undertaking of a public nature for the benefit of
the community or of some
section of the community and that it should have some governmental authority to
do so... Coercive powers
over the individual are given to many governmental
authorities which could be called public authorities, but it is not an essential
part of a conception of a public authority that it should have coercive powers,
whether of an administrative or a legislative character.
It may, however, be an
essential characteristic of the conception that it should have exceptional
powers or authority, for instance
a tramway board or trust has the exceptional
authority of taking its trams down a public street. A water authority may lay
mains, a lighting authority may do the like. Some
exceptional
powers of doing what an ordinary private individual may not do
are generally
found in any body which we would describe as a public authority... [emphasis
[The appellant] has no statutory powers enabling it to do what a private
individual could not do. The elements upon which the appellant
relies for the
claim to be a public authority are restrictive, not enabling. They consist of
provisions of the law and of documents
adopted under the law directed to confine
its activities to public purposes.
Honour also considered the objects of the FOI Act in determining whether a body
is an agency under the FOI Act and stated:
...The central idea
reflected in the objects of the [FOI] Act is that persons and bodies responsible
for State and local government
are to be made more accountable to the public. It
is inconsistent with such a notion to hold that an incorporated body such as
31, which does not exercise regulatory powers, or carry into effect
governmental decisions, should be regarded as an “agency”
meaning of the Act.
the public purposes of an entity must be set out in the legislation establishing
that entity was an argument advanced by Counsel
for Channel 31 in
Hasluck J indicated he was persuaded by those
and ultimately held that
Channel 31 was not a body established for a public purpose under a written law
and therefore not an agency
under the FOI Act.
is binding on my office, respectfully, I agree with Hasluck
J’s approach and consider that
public purposes for a paragraph (e) public body or office need to be found in
the statute establishing the public body or office;
public purposes must be able to be characterized as ‘exceptional’,
‘special’ or ‘regulatory’
Local Government Association of Queensland Inc v Information Commissioner
[2001] QSC 52 (
), the Supreme Court of
Queensland considered a question similar to the matter presently before me. In
that case, Ronald Price had
made an application under the
Information Act 1992
the Queensland FOI Act
) to the Local
Government Association of Queensland (
LGA Queensland
). LGA Queensland
asserted it was not subject to the Queensland FOI Act. The Queensland
Information Commissioner determined on external
review that the LGA Queensland
is a body established for a public purpose under an enactment; an agency for the
purpose of the Queensland
FOI Act; and that the Queensland FOI Commissioner had
appealed the Queensland Information Commissioner’s decision to the Supreme
Court of Queensland.
, Atkinson J was not persuaded that it was necessary for the public
purpose to be set out in the enactment by which the relevant body
established. Her Honour was satisfied that all members of the LGA Queensland
(being local governments and Aboriginal Councils),
as opposed to LGA Queensland
itself, were established for public purposes and that those purposes were set
out in relevant legislation.
Her Honour added:
It would seem to be
almost inevitable that an association whose only members are bodies established
for public purposes would itself
be established for a public purpose. The
objects set out in [the LGA Queensland]
Constitution
and Rules confirm that this
Honour also stated:
The Local Government Association was established
both by an enactment and for a public purpose. The purpose set out in the rules
incorporated into the enactment by s 799 of the 1993 Act although not
set out in the enactment. The association was therefore established
for a public
purpose by an enactment and is a public authority subject to the
This is enough to dispose of the application. In this case, however, even if
the applicant were correct in its argument that the body
which is established
for a public purpose by an enactment must have the public purpose set out in the
enactment by which it is established,
that criterion is satisfied in this case.
Section 1194, by which the Local Government Association was established, is
found in Pt 1 of Ch 18 of the 1993 Act which deals generally
with the Local
Government Association. Section 1195 sets out how the Local Government
Association may make rules. The section provides
that while a rule is not
subordinate legislation it has effect only if approved by the Governor in
Council. If the Governor in Council
approves the rule, notice of the approval
and of the rule must be published in the Gazette. Section 1196 provides that the
Government Association may pay amounts towards expenses of litigation for
matters of common interest to local governments. The remaining
sections in Ch 18
Pt I provide for when payments by local governments are payable to the Local
Government Association and the keeping
of accounts by the Local Government
Association.
These provisions, in particular s 1196, show that the Local Government
Association has been established for a public purpose and that
public purpose is
set out in the enactment. Payment for the conduct of litigation which is for
matters of common interest to local
government, for example, is clearly a public
purpose as local governments are themselves established for the public purpose
government.

now turn to the relevant provisions of the
Local Government Act 1995
9.58 of the LG Act states:
(1) The Western Australian Local Government Association (“WALGA”) is
constituted as a body corporate with perpetual succession
and a common seal.
(2) Proceedings may be taken by or against WALGA in its corporate name.
(3) WALGA has the objects and functions set out in its constitution.
(4) Subject to subsection (5), WALGA may, at any time, amend its constitution
and, whenever it does, it is to forthwith —
(a) give to the Minister; and
(b) lodge with the Commissioner as defined in the
Fair Trading Act 2010
a copy of the amendment to the constitution.
(5) WALGA is not to change the objects for which it is constituted without the
approval of the Minister.
(6) Without limiting the generality of subsection (3), WALGA may —
(a) of its own motion, make representations and submissions to the Minister on
any matter or thing relating to or affecting its members;
(b) with the approval of the affected members, arrange contracts of insurance on
behalf of all or any of its members for any purpose.
(7) WALGA may do all things necessary or convenient to be done to enable it to
achieve its objects and perform its functions.
am satisfied that WALGA is established pursuant to section 9.58(1) of the LG Act
and is therefore established ‘under a written

body or office would need to be found within the
LG Act. I consider this is
consistent with

consider the following provisions of the LG Act are also relevant to the issue
for my determination:
service benefits for [WALGA] employees are to be provided in accordance with
regulations: section 5.48(2); and
is to establish and manage, for the benefit of itself and any eligible body that
chooses to participate, a group self-insurance
arrangement against liability to
pay compensation under the WCIM Act: section 5.49(2).
also has the objects and functions set out in its constitution by virtue of
section 9.58(3) of the LG Act.
, I have turned my mind to whether these purposes confer some
‘exceptional’, ‘special’ or ‘regulatory’
powers or functions.
objects are set out in clause 3 of its constitution and are:
(a) to provide a united voice for Local Government in Western Australia;
(b) to promote the credibility and profile of Local Government;
(c) to speak on behalf of Local Government in Western Australia;
(d) to represent the views of the Association to the State and Federal
Governments on financial, legislative, administration and
policy matters;
(e) to provide services to Local Government in Western Australia;
(f) to promote Local Government issues of importance by involvement with
national bodies;
(g) to do all and any such other things as in the opinion of the State Council
may conveniently be carried on by the Association
or which promote or assist or
are incidental or conducive to the attainment of these objects or any of them,
or anything considered
beneficial to the members of the Association; and
(h) to use the property and income of the Association solely for the promotion
of the objects or purposes of the Association. No
part of the property or income
of the Association may be paid or otherwise distributed, directly or indirectly,
to members of the
Association, except in good faith in the promotion of those
objects or purposes.
Considering
the powers or functions set out in sections 9.58(6)(a), 9.58(6)(b), 5.48(2) and
5.49(2) of the LG Act as well as the objects
imported from WALGA’s
constitution, on balance, I do not consider any of those provisions have the
character of an ‘exceptional’,
‘special’ or
‘regulatory’ powers or functions.
statutory powers or functions are largely permissive – they allow WALGA to
do certain things but do not require
it to do anything. That is to be contrasted
with statutory functions of the type given to, for example, a Law Society which
the legal profession, or responsibilities given to a turf club to
licence racehorses.
exception is the requirements in section 5.49(2) of the LG Act to
‘establish and manage for the benefit of itself ... a
group self-insurance
arrangement against liability to pay compensation under the
Compensation and Injury Management Act 1981
(WA).’ It is arguable the
requirement to provide long service benefits for employees of WALGA in section
5.48(2) LG Act also
falls into this category. However, despite being framed as
requirements, I do not consider these provisions have the character of
‘exceptional’, ‘special’ or ‘regulatory’
powers or functions.
the extent that WALGA may have the capacity to influence government through
advocacy, including through its membership on government
committees, I do not
consider this to be materially different from other interest groups which may
lobby government on matters affecting
their members or supporters. That a body
seeks to advocate to government does not, of itself, mean that body will be
subject to the
FOI Act. To take one example, under
section 5(3)
Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act 1966

Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Advisory Committee (

note that in

public purposes in circumstances that were broadly similar. However, as noted
above, that decision is not binding on me as it is from a different

consideration to the characteristics of ‘public purposes’ in the
manner the Court did in

consideration to the provisions of the FOI Act in Western Australia.
arguable that
is binding on my office. Even if it is not (for
example, if the decision held only that Channel 31 is not an

ratio decidendi
relevant to the issue for my determination), I in any event respectfully agree
with the approach taken by the Court, in particular
in relation to the matters
set out at [34] above, and have applied it to this matter.
summary, I am not satisfied WALGA’s statutory purposes are properly
characterized as ‘exceptional’, ‘special’
‘regulatory’ powers or functions in the way that term is used in
. In my view, WALGA is better described as an advocacy body for
local government with some statutorily conferred functions consistent
role. However, I do not consider those functions rise to the level required to
establish that WALGA’s purposes are
public purposes, as required by
paragraph (e).
not raised by the parties in their submissions, I also note two other matters
relevant to my consideration of this matter.
I note that WALGA’s 2023-24 annual report states that, in the reporting
period, its Record Keeping Plan 2024-29 was submitted
and approved by the State
Records Commission (
the Commission
), in compliance with
State Records Act 2000
observe that section 19 of the SR Act provides that ‘[e]very government
organization must have a record keeping plan that
has been approved by the
Commission under section
‘Government
organization’ is defined in section 3 of the SR Act to mean ‘an
organization in Schedule 1 but does
not include an organization in Schedule
note that the organizations listed in Schedule 1 to the SR Act include, at item
9, ‘[a]n incorporated or unincorporated body
established or continued for
a public purpose under a written law.’ I recognise that item 9 is cast in
almost identical terms
to paragraph (e) of the definition of ‘public body
or office’ in the Glossary to the FOI Act.
understand the Commission first approved a record keeping plan for WALGA in
2016. I have not inquired into how it came to pass
that WALGA submitted a
record keeping plan to the Commission for approval or on what basis WALGA was,
or is, regarded as a government
organization for the purposes of the SR Act
(apart from noting the points stated in [54] above and in this paragraph).
also observe that, from at least 2009 until as recently as 1 April 2024,
WALGA’s website stated that it is not a government
department or
By way of comment, I
consider it is somewhat anomalous that WALGA has been complying with obligations
that apply to government organizations
under the SR Act since at least 2016 and
yet continued to state on its website that it is not a government department or
consider that even if WALGA is a government organization for the purposes of the
SR Act, that is not determinative of whether WALGA
is an agency for the purposes
of the FOI Act. In determining the issue before me, I am required to consider
all of the material
before me which includes the decision in
the guidance provided by the Court regarding the interpretation of paragraph (e)
of the definition of ‘public body or office’
in the Glossary to the
