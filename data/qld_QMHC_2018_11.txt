[1] This is a reference in relation to Emilie Jean McBryde born 2 July 1981.
She is charged with three offences from 13 March 2016:
enter dwelling and commit
indictable offence, imposition, and serious assault on a person over 60. As
well she is charged with possess
utensils from 7 March 2016.
[2] The circumstances of the 13 March 2016 offending were that Ms
McBryde’s behaviour had been worsening in the days prior
to the offending.
Her carer took her to Toowoomba to seek help at the hospital. Having arrived at
the hospital in the afternoon
Ms McBryde was contrary and unco-operative, and
then took herself off to the ambulance bay to have a cigarette. When she was
she could not smoke there, she continued out into a rainy afternoon. At
some point she broke into a house near the hospital which
was owned by a doctor.
She ran herself a bath; lit some candles, helped herself to the contents of the
fridge and smoked some cigarettes.
She got dressed in the doctor’s
scrubs, put on the doctor’s makeup and jewellery and took some money and a
then made her way to the hospital carpark. She importuned a member
of staff who was coming off duty, saying that she was a new doctor
hospital and asked if he could point her in the way of the psychiatric
department. Very soon after that she assaulted him
quite seriously with the
[3] The reference was filed with a report from Dr Kovacevic dated 28 May 2016.
This report was brief. Dr Kovacevic did not purport
to examine all the material
which this Court would have on a hearing. He expressed a “preliminary
opinion” supporting
unsoundness based on “limited information”
“I am therefore prepared to support a referral to
the Mental Health Court where the issue of her criminal capacities can be
investigated further. I would recommend that a Court appointed psychiatrist
should have access to Miss McBryde’s medical records
and witness
statements. I recommend obtaining a collateral history from those who were in
leading up to her alleged
offending.”
[4] Then on 20 April 2018 Dr Kovacevic wrote a letter to Legal Aid which
“Thank you for providing the additional material and
requesting an addendum report.
I wish to advise I have not altered my opinion with regards to the question
of unsoundness of mind.
My opinion regarding the question of fitness to stand trial it outdated and
your client would need to be re-assessed closer to the
time of the Mental Health
Court hearing.
I hope this information is of some assistance.”
[5] This state of reporting was of almost no assistance to the Court. I
understand that Legal Aid has a limited budget, and I accept
that a report in
the nature of Dr Kovacevic’s 28 May 2016 report may be
sufficient to support a reference to the Court. However,
if there is going to
be a contested hearing in the Court where, in this case,
Dr Kovacevic’s opinions are to be the basis for
the defendant
submitting that there is a defence of unsoundness available, a proper report
needs to be obtained before the hearing.
The very brief letter of 20 April 2018
is not sufficient. It does not say what additional material Dr Kovacevic
had. While Dr
Kovacevic says that he had not altered his opinion with
regards to the question of unsoundness, the factual material, including the
opinions of other psychiatrists as to what illnesses or mental health conditions
the defendant suffered, had greatly increased, yet
there is nothing at all to
assist the Court in understanding the basis of Dr Kovacevic’s opinion
as to unsoundness. Further,
as to fitness, which in fact became the most
important question for this Court, Dr Kovacevic said nothing.
[6] The Court needs more assistance from reporting psychiatrists than
Dr Kovacevic offered in this case. His client needed more
reporting than Dr Kovacevic offered her in this case, and it was her
lawyer’s job to have a proper report prepared.
It is of no assistance to
a defendant, or to the Court, to have vaguely formulated and ill
thought‑out opinions put forward
which do not comply with fundamental
rules of evidence such as the rule that an expert report should allow the Court
to understand
why an expert has reached conclusions.
[7] In his oral evidence Dr Kovacevic wavered between his original opinion
that the defendant was experiencing a brief psychotic
episode at the time of the
offending, and the opinion that the current treating doctors were likely correct
in their diagnosis of
schizoaffective disorder and that, therefore, it was
likely the defendant was suffering a relapse of schizoaffective disorder at
time of the offending. It particularly mattered in this case for very soon
after the assault in the carpark the defendant gave
a version of events to
police. That was recorded, and it gave non-psychotic reasons for her actions.
Dr Kovacevic agreed in his
evidence that a non‑psychotic account
given so soon after the offending was far more consistent with the defendant
having suffered
a brief psychotic episode than with her having suffered a
relapse of schizoaffective disorder.
[8] Dr Voita gave a report of 3 March 2017. She has been the defendant’s
treating psychiatrist since 23 June 2016 and had,
at the time of her report,
seen the defendant on more than 40 occasions. She has the view that Ms McBryde
is properly diagnosed
as having schizoaffective disorder and borderline
personality disorder.
[9] Dr Voita obtained a history from the defendant that she had used half a gram
of amphetamine intravenously a couple of days before
the offending and had not
had much sleep between that drug use and the time of the offending. The
defendant told Dr Voita that she
was “high as a kite as well as
psychotic” at the time of the offending. As well Dr Voita gathered
the information that
on 7 March 2016 the defendant told her general
practitioner she was using 25 cones of marijuana a day, and that she had smoked
at 8.00 pm on the day before the offending. Further, that on 11 March
2016 the defendant had telephoned her case manager to say
that she had spent all
her money (thought to be around $350) on buying amphetamine and cannabis.
[10] There are obvious difficulties with this history. First, it is most
unlikely the defendant purchased half a gram of amphetamine
with $350. Further,
half a gram of amphetamine is a great deal to inject at one time. It appears
none of this history was questioned.
However, not having questioned the
history, Dr Voita did not deal with it in order to assess whether or not the
defendant was intoxicated
at the time of the offending. She gave the opinion
that she thought the defendant was deprived of the capacities to know she ought
not do the acts, and to control herself at the time of the offending.
[11] Dr Voita thought the defendant was unfit for trial presently. She had
tried many antipsychotic medications before trialling
Clozapine. She had
thought that the defendant did respond to treatment with Clozapine for some
time, but then had deteriorated again
in the months prior to the hearing of the
reference before this Court.
[12] Dr Scott gave a report dated 5 January 2018. He thought that the defendant
had borderline personality disorder and chronic
dysthymia, but saw her behaviour
on 13 March 2016 as behaviour which was predominantly caused by her borderline
personality disorder.
He relied upon her behaviour in the watch-house and her
statements to police immediately after the offending as indicating that
not deprived of any capacity. He found no evidence of intoxication.
[13] At the time Dr Scott saw the defendant he thought that she was temporarily
unfit. He would not be drawn in his oral evidence
as to whether or not he
thought the unfitness was permanent.
[14] In all these circumstances, I was grateful for the advice of my assisting
psychiatrist Dr Harden. He advised that I accept
the opinions that the
defendant suffered from borderline personality and advised that the facts of
this offending were made complicated
by the fact that people with borderline
personality disorder do hear voices, often called pseudo‑hallucinations,
that disorder. Having such pseudo-hallucinations does not mean that
the person has an illness and it does not mean that the person
is psychotic.
[15] Dr Harden advised that there was clear evidence, looking over the
defendant’s history, that she had suffered from severe
mood disturbance,
depression, but not mania, in the past.
[16] He did not think that the evidence supported the defendant suffering from
any psychosis until June 2016, ie., after the offending.
He preferred the
opinion of Dr Voita as to current diagnosis – schizoaffective disorder.
However, he advised that he could
not see any evidence of symptoms that were
convincingly psychotic in the period around the offending.
[17] In those circumstances, it seems to me that the evidence does not establish
that the defendant suffered from something which
qualified as a mental disease
at the time of the offending. Furthermore, there was no convincing evidence to
my mind that the defendant
was deprived of any capacity at the time of the
offending. Dr Harden advised that the police recording, as well as the
defendant’s
own account of her behaviour (which she said was driven by
voices), did not “show positive evidence of psychotic phenomena
clearly deprived her of
[18] Dr Harden’s view was that it would be unusual for the defendant to be
intoxicated two days after having consumed drugs.
He preferred the view of Dr
Scott in this regard. So do I. The version which the defendant gave to Dr
Voita might well raise questions
as to intoxication but primarily, to my mind,
it raises questions as to its reliability.
[19] Dr Harden advised that realistically the evidence showed that this
defendant was permanently unfit for trial in respect of these
defences. As he
“Dr Voita couldn’t bring herself to say that
she was permanently unfit, but she’s been in High Secure Hospital for
years. She’s a little bit improved. ... I think there’s a
vanishingly small chance that she will become fit enough
to give evidence in a
trial. It seems likely that her decompensation in more recent times may well be
related to matters associated
[20] My findings are that:
1. The defendant was not of unsound
mind at the time of the offending.
2. The defendant is permanently unfit for trial.
3. There ought to be a forensic order made.
