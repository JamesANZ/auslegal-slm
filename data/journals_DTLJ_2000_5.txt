Protection of Computer

The title of this work
is both too narrow and too wide.
too narrow so far as it suggests that it is limited to the law of the
Kingdom since it is awash with reference to, and
detail from, the law
justice to the illumination
which the work sheds on contractual issues,
the validity of shrink-wrap licensing.
It is too wide in that it suggests coverage of the whole
of the law of
infringement.
there is no discussion of authorship,
ownership, or term.
understandably
enough, are some surrounding and relevant areas such as patent or
competition described in any detail.
The work deserves evaluation for what it is, a detailed
examination of
some important areas of copyright in relation to computer programs,
from an enlightened, and technically expert, point of view.
author often adopts a robust attitude towards the sometimes
incompletely
thought out views of other commentators, or even judges.
seems insufficiently sceptical in his own approach. Thus he accepts,
much critical discussion, the common
view that because
restricted the range of protectible material in a computer
program, it also restricted the degree of protection offered to the
but this does not necessarily follow.
It is at least arguable, that the less that is
protectible, the more
likely it is that the lesser remaining portion will have been
of its having been copied.
is often claimed that the speed of technological development exceeds
the law, and that this creates problems.
This claim is highly misleading.
A more significant contrast is between the seamless
development of case
law, and the sudden lurches of legislative reaction.
This is exacerbated not only by the delays of lawyers in
appreciating technological development, but also by delays of
technologists
appreciating legal development, which tends to precipitate new case law.
This book provides an
interesting
illustration, in that perhaps the most significant developments since
written relate much
more to working out the implications of the
legislative
reaction to technological development by such measures as the Digital
book, but which deserves larger treatment), and the turmoil into
cast European and English legislative reactions.
is a stimulating and largely well-written work.
It reflects its academic origin in the extremely helpful
which it is organised both between, and within chapters.
The reader is given a
strong indication of
what he is going to find, although there is still occasional
repetition, and at
of each chapter the reader is presented with a further summary
it contained.
material is extremely
well-handled, and makes a number of illuminating, and original points,
example in the helpful comparison
between the look and feel of a
program and of a motor car.
valuable insight is provided by pointing out that the protection of
preparatory
materials probably eliminates any need to
protect screen displays as
since they will very often appear in the former.
The book is well produced but there are
a few blemishes in the form of typos, and the occasional date is
irritatingly
omitted from
a reference to an article.
It is a very useful work, designed to be used as a
complement to some
more basic, prosaic and less committed, text.
Its author, and publisher, are to be congratulated.
