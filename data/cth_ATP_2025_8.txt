INTRODUCTION
Panel, Michael Lishman, Rebecca Maslen-Stannage (sitting President) and
Emma-Jane Newton declined to conduct proceedings on two
applications from
Benjamin Hornigold Ltd – one in relation to the affairs of Keybridge
Capital Limited (Administrator Appointed)
and the other in relation to its own
affairs. The two applications (heard together) concerned (among other matters)
allegations that
the incumbent Keybridge directors had taken steps to frustrate
their replacement with new directors at a requisitioned meeting of
shareholders, alleged undisclosed relevant interests in Keybridge and Benjamin
Hornigold, and alleged undisclosed associations
or concert party behaviours in
relation to Keybridge and Benjamin Hornigold. The Panel considered that there
was no reasonable prospect
that it would declare the circumstances
unacceptable.

announcements stating that:
“via an independent sub-committee, formally demanded the
repayment of the outstanding loan balance, being $4.6 million (Loan),

reach a formal agreement regarding an extension

directors had not had chance to review the impact of the company being in
Voluntary Administration. To which I later responded
that 3 of the incoming
directors were present and had not withdrawn our consents, so is not a reason to
Administrator appointed needed time to consider the administration
(b) immediately after Mr Patton purported to adjourn the meeting,
“Jesse Hamilton from WAM immediately put forward a motion to continue

of the company in
attendance, they elected a new Chairman... then they continued through the
resolutions”

“[t]o enable the
orderly progression of the Administration, notice is given that the adjourned
meeting will be reconvened on
22 April 2025”

Keybridge, the resolution ratifying the previous issue
of 2,581,816 shares to
sophisticated and professional investors was passed, however Resolution 7 was
not put due to the ongoing proceedings
regarding the Capital Raising Meeting
referred to in paragraph
APPLICATIONS
Declaration sought
Hornigold submitted a single application dated 21 February 2025 seeking a
declaration of unacceptable circumstances in relation
to the affairs of
Keybridge and its own affairs. It acknowledged that this effectively constituted
two separate applications, and
we decided to deal with the applications together
regulation 16(1)(a)
Australian Securities and Investments
Commission Regulations 2001
its applications, Benjamin Hornigold submitted (among other things)
(a) The Incumbent Keybridge Directors
“have taken numerous actions
to thwart or frustrate the [Proposed] Keybridge Directors from taking office as
Directors of Keybridge,
which alone or together comprise unacceptable
circumstances in relation to Keybridge”
(b) The above actions
“also comprise unacceptable circumstances in
relation to [Benjamin Hornigold], since they impact at least the 19.59%
shareholding
in [Benjamin Hornigold] held or controlled by Keybridge, and when
considered with further undisclosed relevant interests by Bolton
in [Benjamin
Hornigold], it means that there is a control‑threshold stake (of more than
20% of [Benjamin Hornigold] shares)
controlled by the concert parties
undertaking those unacceptable actions”
(c) Mr Bolton’s voting power in Keybridge has not been fully
(d) There are
“material undisclosed associations or concert party
behaviours in relation to both Keybridge Shares and [Benjamin Hornigold]
which are adversely impacting the efficient, competitive and informed market for
[Benjamin Hornigold] shares, in frustration
of the purposes reflected in
section 602”
Interim orders sought
Hornigold sought an interim order that
“Keybridge, its Administrator
and any officer of Keybridge be restrained forthwith from disposing or entering
into ... any agreement,
arrangement or understanding to dispose of any of
Keybridge’s 19.59% interest in [Benjamin Hornigold]
Final orders sought
Hornigold sought a final order that
“Keybridge (and its Administrator)
divest forthwith the full parcel of 19.59% [Benjamin Hornigold] shares in ASIC
for sale or
Preliminary submissions
21 February 2025, we received preliminary submissions from WAM Active. We did
not receive preliminary submissions from any other
interested parties.
Active submitted that:
(a) The applications seek orders in relation to matters currently subject of
(i) urgent injunctive relief sought by WAM Active
and others and listed before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 24 February
Injunctive Relief Application
(ii) final relief sought by WAM Active and others
and set down for hearing on an expedited basis in the above proceedings in the
Court of New South Wales on 5 and 6 March 2025 (
Director and
Administrator Proceedings
(b) In the Injunctive Relief Application, WAM Active
is seeking an injunction against Keybridge and its administrator from disposing
of assets (which would include Keybridge’s shares in Benjamin Hornigold)
without first giving WAM Active 7 days’ notice.
This is intended to
preserve the status quo pending the outcome of the Director and Administrator
Proceedings to be heard the following
(c) In the Director and Administrator Proceedings, WAM Active is seeking orders
(i) the purported appointment of the Keybridge administrator was void or should
end immediately
(ii) Mr Patton’s purported adjournment of the S249F Meeting was void
(iii) Messrs Bolton, Patton and Dukes were removed as directors at the S249F
Meeting and
(iv) the Proposed Keybridge Directors were appointed as directors at the S249F
regard to the above, WAM Active submitted that the Court proceedings overlap
with the majority of the submissions contained
in the applications (particularly
in relation to the purported appointment of Keybridge’s administrator and
purported adjournment
of the S249F Meeting).
Active also submitted that the outcome of the proceedings may have a material
effect on whether orders from the Panel are still
required or should be made. If
WAM Active is successful, Keybridge’s new board would need to consider the
matters raised in
the applications, as well as Keybridge’s response to the
applications if they are still on foot.
Out of process submission from Benjamin
decided to accept an out of process rebuttal submission from Benjamin
Among other things,
Benjamin Hornigold submitted that:
(a) “WAM’s proceedings will not deal with the unacceptable
circumstances surrounding Bolton accumulating a greater than
20% relevant
interest in [Benjamin Hornigold] shares, and the non-disclosures surrounding the
accumulation of that stake... the undisclosed
acquisitions of a
control-threshold level stake in [Benjamin Hornigold] in and of itself, merits
proceedings and investigation by
(b) The interim orders sought are not inconsistent with the orders sought in the
Injunctive Relief Application.
(c) The final orders sought could be expressed to be
“subject to the
Court varying any interlocutory order given in response to WAM’s
application [to the Court]... to allow
that vesting to occur”
(d) In any event, WAM Active “
will be obliged to raise with the Court
the position sought by [Benjamin Hornigold] in its application, and the Court
could take that
position into account and the potential for Panel orders to be
made in formulating any interlocutory order made”
Orders made in response to Injunctive Relief
Application
26 February 2025 (before our first meeting), the Supreme Court of New South
Wales made orders giving effect to those sought by
WAM Active and others in the
Injunctive Relief Application, subject to some minor caveats which are not
relevant to these proceedings.

only specifically address those things that we
consider necessary to explain our

principle is reflected in paragraph 4.6(b) of the Panel’s Procedural
Guidelines, which identifies
“whether the circumstances are the subject
of court proceedings”
as a factor the Panel considers in deciding
whether to conduct proceedings.
this instance, we consider that the circumstances outlined in the applications
substantially overlap matters in the Injunctive
Relief Application and the
Director and Administrator Proceedings, or may be materially affected by the
outcome of those proceedings.
agree with WAM Active’s submission that the outcome of the Court
proceedings may have a material effect on whether orders
from the Panel are
still required or should be made. As submitted by WAM Active, if WAM Active is
successful, Keybridge’s new
board would need to consider the matters
raised in the applications, as well as Keybridge’s response to the
applications if
they are still on foot.
our view, the Panel should apply a cautious approach to making orders which may
have consequences in relation to litigation on
foot. In any event, the Supreme
Court of New South Wales is better placed to deal with most of the circumstances
outlined in the
applications as part of the Injunctive Relief Application and
Director and Administrator Proceedings.
also consider it relevant that:
(a) in response to the Injunctive Relief Application, the Court has already made
orders that substantially cover the same ground
as the interim orders sought by
Benjamin Hornigold and
(b) WAM Active, despite sharing many of the same concerns raised by Benjamin
Hornigold, appeared to suggest that we should decline
to conduct proceedings
given the substantial overlap with the existing Court proceedings.
in relation to those matters not being dealt with directly in the Court
proceedings (such as Mr Bolton’s and others’
alleged undisclosed
relevant interests in Keybridge and Benjamin Hornigold, as well as the alleged
undisclosed associations or concert
party behaviours in relation to Keybridge
and Benjamin Hornigold), we:
(a) had concerns regarding the strength of the evidence provided and
(b) considered that these matters form part of a broader dispute between
Keybridge and WAM Active, and it is not appropriate in the
circumstances to
adjudicate on these discrete aspects of the broader
already decided that there is no reasonable prospect that we would declare the
circumstances unacceptable, we do not consider
that it is necessary to consider
and come to a decision on whether Benjamin Hornigold has standing under section
657C(2) to make
an application in relation to the affairs of
the reasons above, we do not consider that there is any reasonable prospect that
we would make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances
in relation to the
affairs of Keybridge or Benjamin Hornigold. Accordingly, we have decided not to
conduct proceedings in relation
to both applications under
regulation 20
Australian Securities and Investments Commission Regulations 2001
that we have decided not to conduct proceedings, it is not appropriate to make
any interim or final orders.
21 March 2025, the Supreme Court of New South Wales handed down its judgement in
the Director and Administrator Proceedings (see
