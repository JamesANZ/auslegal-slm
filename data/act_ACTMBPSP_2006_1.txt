Professional Standards Panel Outcomes
The subject matter of the inquiry
centred on two areas of complaint. The first was rough treatment
of a patient during an internal
examination, a failure by the
practitioner to demonstrate adequate communication skills, and a failure
to meet expected standard
of hygiene in performance of speculum and
internal examinations. The second was a breach by the practitioner
of the patient�s privacy
by providing the results of her Pap smear to
another person without consent.
The panel decided that the treatment complaints had not been made
out. It did decide, however, that the allegation of breach of
undertaking from the practitioner that she will not again breach
patients� privacy in this way. It noted that she has stated that
she now routinely notifies patients by letter.
