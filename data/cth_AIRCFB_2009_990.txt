This decision deals with an application by AustralianSuper Pty Ltd (AustralianSuper) to vary the
Registered and Licensed Clubs Award 2010
(the modern award) by adding AustralianSuper as a default fund in cl.23.4.
AustralianSupers informed us that the Australian Retirement Fund (ARF) merged with Savings Trust Australia (STA) to form AustralianSuper.
It is clear that ARF is a named default fund in the
Hotels, Motels, Wine Saloons, Catering, Accommodation, Clubs and Casino Employees (Northern Territory) Award 2002
Liquor Industries Hotels, Hostels, Clubs and Boarding Establishments etc. (Australian Capital Territory) Award, 1998.
The application was supported by the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union (LHMU). It was opposed by Clubs Australia and the
LHMU New South Wales Branch. They submitted that the two awards referred to are minor ones and the addition of AustralianSuper is
not supported by the major parties with an interest in the modern award.
In our decision of 2 September 2009, we said:
“A number of funds have since made applications to be included as named default funds on the basis that the fund was nominated
as a default fund in an award-based transitional instrument relevant to the coverage of the modern award or on the basis that the
representatives of the main parties covered by the award consent. In our view either basis would constitute a good reason for the
fund being specified as a default fund in a modern award.”
AustralianSuper
is nominated as a default fund in an award-based transitional instrument relevant to the coverage of the modern award. Consistent
with the passage we have set out from the 2 September 2009 decision we have decided to grant the application. An order will issue
in due course.
