REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
13 October last I made findings and preliminary orders on the issue of liability
in this matter and called for submissions from
the parties on penalty,
compensation and costs. Submissions have been received from the applicant
also indicated that I would be assisted by being informed on a number of issues
I there specified. I now have that information.
am informed that the total amount of rent still owing to landlords by the first
respondent is $14,650.30.
am informed that $2,880.00 collected from tenants for rental bonds has not yet
been paid to the Residential Tenancies Authority
expect that the burden of compensating those who have lost money will fall on
the fidelity fund set up under
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
(“the Act”).
have also been informed that the second respondent has been dealt with in the
Magistrates Court for failing to pay tenants’
bonds to the RTA, for
failing to give tenants a receipt for bond money received, as required by the
legislation, and for failing
to ensure that the corporate licensee complied with
was fined $10,000.00 and ordered to pay court costs of $289.00, professional
costs of $5,000.00 and compensation of $9,800.00.
asked to be informed of the second respondent’s ability to meet an order
for the payment of money, but nothing has been placed
the reasons I published on 13 October I explained why no money orders can be
made against the first respondent, but that I am not
precluded from imposing a
disqualification order. Having regard to the findings I made against this
company on 13 October and the
further information I have been given, I think
that the public should forever be protected from the bumblings and depredations
this company. I will order that it be permanently disqualified from holding a
the case of the second respondent, I have already found that he is not a
suitable person to hold a managerial position in a real
estate office and not a
suitable person to have any control over trust moneys. Having regard to his
age, and to his persistence
in maintaining that all of the problems in the
agency were everyone else’s fault, other than his, ( an untenable
in my view, having regard to the evidence), I do not see any point in
any disqualification other than a permanent one. I cannot
see any basis for
thinking that Mr Dodds would ever change his ways. The public should be
protected permanently from the prospect
that he would be in a position to manage
other people’s affairs and handle other people’s money. I will
order that he
be disqualified permanently from holding a licence. I will not
extend that disqualification to the holding of a salesman’s
registration,
leaving him free to work as such, if the licensing authority sees fit to grant
him such registration. Presumably,
conditions could be framed to prevent him
having any control over trust funds, or to restrict his handling of such moneys.
to whether he should be ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty, I note that there
has already been such an order made in the magistrates
court, and that there has
been some overlapping of the issues before that court and before me –
failing to pay tenants’
bonds to the RTA, and failing to ensure that the
corporate licensee complies with the Act. In the circumstances, I will not
a pecuniary penalty. I think that the order for permanent
disqualification will serve the dual purpose of protecting the public
principal purpose of these proceedings) and punishing him.
Compensation
applicant seeks an order that the second respondent compensate the applicant for
interest lost by reason of the unauthorised withdrawals
from the trust account.
The loss has been quantified by the witness O’Keefe in a supplementary
statement (done at the request
of Mr Dodds). He should pay that sum, having
regard to his part in facilitating the misappropriations.
applicant seeks professional costs fixed at $10,880.00. I have been presented
with a calculation as to how that sum is arrived
at. The figures appear to me
to be very reasonable, in the circumstances. It was essential that the
applicant be legally represented
in this matter. This was so not only because
of the charges and the evidence to be presented, but also because the attitude
Dodds made the smooth progress of the hearing impossible. By this I mean
that he set out by demanding that almost every witness
of the applicant’s
who had given a statement be called, and by paying only token regard to orders
to formulate his defence
and provide statements from proposed witnesses. At the
hearing, it soon emerged that his reasons for demanding to cross-examine
the applicant’s witnesses were without merit, having regard to the issues
in the case. A lay advocate for the applicant
would have had difficulty dealing
with these obstructions, and my task would have been more difficult.
Dodds’ attitude meant that the hearing was considerably longer than it
should have been. At one stage I felt obliged to
warn him that I had the power
to order him to pay the costs of the attendance of witnesses for whom he
requested a summons to issue
(section 77(3)).
It was soon apparent at the
hearing that he had no real defence to the charges. His response was that all
of the mismanagement
was someone else’s fault. I have dealt with this in
the reasons I published on 13 October. I will simply repeat that I regarded
as a head-in-the-sand attitude and a failure to appreciate his responsibilities
as the executive officer of the corporate licensee.
the end result, a sensible and responsible response to the charges would have
resulted in a very much shorter hearing, if not indeed
a plea of guilty. Having
regard to the matters set out in
Commercial and Consumer
Tribunal Act 2003
interpreted by the Court of Appeal in
Tamawood and Anor v Paans
[2005] QCA 111
, and to the circumstances I have discussed above, I think it
is appropriate that he pay the applicant’s costs fixed at $10,880.00.
