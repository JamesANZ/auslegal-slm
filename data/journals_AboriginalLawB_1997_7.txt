The central role of the National Native Title Tribunal ('the NNTT') is to
mediate individual resolutions to claimant applications
for a determination of
native title. This mediation process is fundamentally connected with the
business of history, because the
parties to negotiations are inevitably
conditioned by their personal, familial, and cultural histories, and these
histories raise
issues that must be dealt with, if mediation is to progress. The
National Native Title Tribunal then, is required to undertake a
project that is,
of its essence, historiographical in nature. A recent short publication that
considers the issue of the interaction
between historical understanding and
native title is
When History Meets the New Native Title Era at the
Negotiating Table: a Case Study in Reconciling Land Use in Broome, Western
, by Sue Jackson. In this work Jackson evaluates the performance of
the NNTT in its role as the impartial mediator of native title
claims, in the
context of the historical experience of Aboriginal people in the Shire of Broome
in North Western Australia. Jackson's
basic, and probably uncontroversial,
proposition is that:
'An historical background is crucial to an understanding of the contemporary
degree of disaffection in the Aboriginal community in
Broome and, above all,
important because it is the experience of past events and the grievances
suffered which people bring to the
negotiating table when pursuing native title
claims. The recent history of the exclusion of Aboriginal people from plans and
processes informs their assessment of their ability to influence
today's decisions and to negotiate as equals. This history cannot
be dismissed
as a thing of the past' (ppl-2).
In order to support this proposition, just over half of the book is spent
describing the history of land use in the Broome region.
The story is all too
familiar: by statute, regulation, economics, politics and administrative
practices, the Aboriginal people of
the Broome region have been systematically
ignored, or intentionally deprived of rights, and disempowered by sources of
white authority.
The result, as set out by Jackson, is that:
'Aboriginal peoples' aspirations for land and sea rights have not been met in
Broome: they directly own very little land within the
township and have been
largely ignored by land use and marine resource decisions, excepting very recent
instances' (p4).
Jackson reveals how even though recent State and Shire governments may have
adopted the rhetoric of consultation with Aboriginal people
over land use, they
have 'been unable or unwilling to even attempt to address' the fundamental
causes 'of Aboriginal disenchantment
and disempowerment' (p22).
It is against this historical background that Jackson considers one practical
dimension of the new law of
Mabo [No. 2] (Mabo v Queensland [No. 2]
[1992] HCA 23
(1992) 175 CLR 1)
Native Title Act 1993
(Cth) ('the NTA') -
what she describes as 'the New Native Title Era'. The initial native title claim
in Broome was the first to be
lodged under the auspices of the NTA in Western
Australia, and it was soon followed by a number of others, totalling eight in
Broome region at the time of the author's writing. Once a native title claim
has met certain formal administrative requirements,
the NNTT is compelled by s72
of the NTA to attempt to mediate the consensual resolution of the claim between
the native title claimants
and other parties with interests in the claimed
Jackson's basic position is to indict the NNTT for failing to make reasonable
allowance for the effects of historical experience on
Aboriginal people, in its
management of the dynamics of the mediation process. She claims that the NNTT's
mediation strategy is premised
on the naive assumption that the NNTT 'can
divorce itself from the history of power relations which continue to influence
the contemporary
political environment in which it operates' (p38), and further
states that the NNTT is 'deluding itself if it believes it can remove
from history and society so easily and painlessly (p38). Jackson argues that
such delusions and assumptions manifest themselves
in the NNTT taking an
overly-simplistic approach to mediation. Commenting on the NNTT's Mediation
Procedures, Jackson warns that
mere 'shuttle diplomacy' is insufficient to
redress the impacts of 'dispossession and colonisation' (p38). She argues that
the interests-based
model of mediation developed by the Harvard Mediation
Project (and adopted by the NNTT) through its Mediation Procedures may be
inappropriate to negotiations involving Aboriginal people (See M
'Mediation: Towards an Aboriginal Conceptualisation'
Aboriginal Law Bulletin 10).
Commentaries like Jackson's probably act as a necessary corrective to the
NNTT's errors of approach. The NNTT itself formally welcomes
criticism, and its
Mediation Procedures begin with an acknowledgment that they are to be modified
over time in light of feedback
from parties to the mediation process. Thus, if
the NNTT has not been sufficiently sensitive to the extent to which historical
underpins all native title mediation then, as an institution, it will
very much want to be informed of such failure. Perhaps Jackson
might be rebuked
for concentrating on the negative, but if that is her perception then it may
well be shared by the Aboriginal actors
in the process. Her book was written
with the collaboration of the Kimberley Land Council and the Rubibi Land,
Heritage and Development
Working Group (set up by the Yawuru, Djugan and
Goollarbooloo Aboriginal Groups in September 1994 as the umbrella group for a
of native title claims in Broome). Nevertheless, the very existence of
the Rubibi Group is a ground-breaking event, as the establishment
process-generated structure for integrating a number of Aboriginal groups and
Aboriginal decision making systems with the requirements
of the Commonwealth
legal system.
In a broader sense, underlying Jackson's book (and indeed a fair chunk of the
analysis in all its algal bloom proportions) is the basic
question as to what extent the
Mabo [No. 2]
decision and the enactment of
the NTA has marked a rupture or a continuity with past Aboriginal-white power
relations; however, that
question is too broad for both this review and for
Jackson's discussion paper, although her work does very much raise the
Ultimately, the National Native Title Tribunal would be foolish not to heed
criticisms such as those of Jackson. All parties bring
their historical baggage
to the mediation process, and a failure to make sufficient allowance for this in
the conduct of the process
will, without doubt, have a deleterious effect on the
fruitfulness of those meditations and on the reconciliation project in general,
in all its multiple micro-manifestations around the country. In this respect,
the Tribunal must be relentlessly self critical: but
self critical with hope.
Federal legislative intervention permitting, the NNTT lives and learns.
