Cases referred to
Appearances
Mr D Caddy (Agent) appeared for the Appellant
Mr A Podgorny (Agent) appeared for the Respondent
The Tribunal:
1. This arose as the result of an application by Screentech (Aust) Pty Ltd for a
light-emitting display pylon sign on Lot 802, numbers
1 to 7 Marshall Road
Myaree, that application being made on 3 December 2003. The site itself is
currently developed and contains
the Melville Centre Shopping Centre.
2. The application was granted conditional approval on 2 July 2004. An
application for an amended planning approval which might
be better described as
a fresh application for the same site for an identical structure with the same
containing provision for third party advertising
or parties external to the site, was made on 22 July 2004.
3. That application was refused by the Respondent on 20 September 2004. The
decision in that case was expressed in a notice from
the City of Melville dated
10 September 2004. The application was refused under the provisions of
Community Planning Scheme No.5
Metropolitan Region Scheme for the following
“1. The application does not demonstrate proper
and orderly planning of the property.
2. The application is for third party advertising and is likely to lead to
proliferation of undesirable advertising signs on lot 802
Marshall Road, Myaree.
3. The proposal is not in keeping with the objectives of the Mixed District
Precinct under the Community Planning Scheme No.5.”
4. It should be stressed that the only difference between the approved sign and
that now proposed is that the spare capacity of the
sign will be used to carry
advertising for parties who do not occupy the site.
5. From the evidence the shape and operation of the sign has already been
approved and the Appellant is currently entitled to build
and operate an LED
pylon sign. The only difference is that they don not have specific approval for
a sign that allows that advertising
described as third party by the Respondent.
6. It was common ground the only issue is that regarding the need to ensure that
there is not a proliferation of illegal signs on
the site that might arise as a
result of non-resident advertisers taking up all the space on the sign.
7. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the proposed third party
advertising will be contrary or orderly and proper planning
or the objectives of
the Scheme and, in fact, the existing approval for a structure that looks like
and would operate almost identically
to that now sought has already been
approved in terms of orderly and proper planning by the Respondent when it
considered the earlier
8. To suggest that the approval to the application would lead to a proliferation
of the unauthorised signage on the site as suggested
by the second reason for
refusal is simply speculation and not supported by the evidence. In any event,
the Respondent has powers
to control all advertising on the site.
9. I can see nothing in the Scheme or Local Laws controlling signage that would
prevent the application. In fact, that was acknowledged
by Mr Podgorny in
evidence. There is nothing, therefore, to stop the Tribunal from approving the
application if it is convinced
that it would be consistent with orderly and
proper planning.
10. On the evidence I am satisfied that the approval would lead to a proper
planning outcome. My only concern is that tenants be
given a protected right to
advertise if only to prevent what the Respondent sees as some difficulty that
might arise in the future
as a result of the need for tenants to resort to their
own advertising.
11. Mr Podgorny gave evidence for the Respondent and agreed that this might
be addressed through a legally binding agreement
12. In the circumstances the appeal is allowed subject to a condition requiring
the Appellant to enter into an agreement with the
Respondent to ensure that
tenants on the site are given preference in advertising over other parties not
represented on the site.
13. The parties have 21 days to agree the condition and in the event that
agreement cannot be reached, the parties have leave to
bring the matter back to
the Tribunal.
