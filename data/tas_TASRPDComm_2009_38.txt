LATROBE PLANNING SCHEME NO. 1 OF 1994
Draft Amendment 3/08
The Amendment
The amendment seeks to rezone rural land for industrial purposes and introduce
provisions complementary to draft amendment 2008/03
to the Devonport and
Environs Planning Scheme 1984, to facilitate development of a regional
industrial estate that is integrated
in terms of use, development standards and
infrastructure.
meeting on 2 February 2009 and pursuant to Section 8 of the
Resource Planning and Development Commission Act 1997
, the Commission
delegated to Commissioner Roger Howlett and Mr John Vandenberg jointly and
powers and functions under
sections 40
(2), of the
Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993

For several years three Councils
in the region – Devonport, Latrobe and Kentish, together with the
Department of Economic Development
(DED), the Department of Infrastructure
Energy and Resources (DIER) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) Land Use
Planning Branch
– have jointly investigated the demand for, and
availability of, land for industrial purposes. The most recent of those
investigations
is the Mersey Regional Industrial Area Planning Study prepared by
Hydro Tasmania Consulting. (Version no. 2, finalised 20 June 2008.)
It has been
adopted by the Latrobe Council as a supporting document for the
An extensive analysis of seven potential industrial sites has
identified land near the Devonport Airport as the most suitable site
industrial development to suit the current and future needs of the three
(the Study Area
).” (Hydro Tasmania Consulting,
The report examined the environmental, social and economic values within the
Study Area. The findings and some relevant recommendations
of the report are
included in the following summary, together with information supplied by the
Council in its report pursuant to
Land Use Planning and Approvals
The three local government areas occupy 1,850 km
have a combined population of approximately 37,000 people. Agriculture is a
major industry in the region and the temperate climate
would be favourable for
more capital-intensive Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), or in other
words, hydroponic cultivation
in glass houses or equivalent structures.
The Study Area occupies part of the coastal plain between Pardoe Beach and
Brooke Street/ Pardoe Developmental Road and straddles
the Devonport/Latrobe
boundary west of the Devonport Airport. Approximately 62% of the study area is
within the Latrobe municipality
and 38% within the City of Devonport. Apart from
the coastal reserve and the city’s sewerage treatment plant, the land is
owned and currently used for agricultural/grazing
The site occupies some 167 hectares, of which approximately 28 ha is not
available for development and a further 27 ha would be required
for service and
transport infrastructure, leaving a balance of 112 hectares of land available
for new industrial development.
Devonport’s amendment proposes to create a Mersey Regional Industrial Zone
(MRIZ) while the Latrobe proposal is to adopt specified
departures governed by
the same schedule for several titles which collectively form the Mersey Regional
Industrial Area (MRIA). For
the purposes of this decision the proposed MRIZ and
MRIA are referred to collectively under the umbrella term of Mersey Regional
Industrial Estate, or MRIE.

Pardoe Beach is a high energy beach system backed by vegetated dunes. Hydro
Consulting reported that the dunes were 10-15 metres
high in places. [However,
detailed contour information tabled at the hearing indicates that the dunes
range between 0 and 7m AHD.
(Lidar data acquired March 2008 for DPIW.)
Behind the coastal dune and wetland system, the land is generally flat, gently
sloping, cleared grazing land, crossed by northward
flowing drainage lines.
Levels range from 3.5m – 4 m AHD immediately south of the dunes to 8m
– 10m AHD along the Brooke
Street frontage. Land Systems of Tasmania
classifies the area as equivalent to (non-prime) Class 4 agricultural land,
to wind erosion, waterlogging and salting. A site-specific land
capability survey has not been submitted.
The coastal fringe is also an area containing Aboriginal cultural heritage
values and holds extensive evidence of occupation, including
shell fragments,
seal bones and stone artefacts. Despite disturbance by agricultural use and
municipal works the MRIE is reported
to contain “...
a potentially
valuable archaeological deposit
...” Also, “
The exposed
cultural material is extremely fragile and vulnerable to damage
The study noted, at p.18, “
The area adjacent to the coastline for
approximately 1.6 km (from the eastern boundary to Teatree Rd on the western
edge) and extending
approximately 300m inland, should be excluded from any
future development by zoning it appropriately. The extent of the cultural
deposit, and the potential for sub-surface material to be present makes it
unlikely that impacting on this site could be avoided
if it was subject to
development.”
It recommended that a complete detailed survey by an
Aboriginal Heritage Officer should precede any development.
Some minor historic cultural heritage items (farm machinery etc) were located at
the boundary of Ransford Gardens, but no other items
of historic significance
were noted.
From desktop research, Hydro Consulting reported there are scattered patches of
native forest within the MRIE, including two threatened
native vegetation
communities (
Eucalyptus ovata
forest and woodland,
swamp forest). These communities were recommended by the study to
be excluded from development. Any clearing of this vegetation would
separate approval under a Forest Practices Plan. Further surveys were also
recommended to verify potential habitats for the
green and gold frog, a
burrowing crayfish, the swift parrot and the masked owl, so that mitigation
strategies could be implemented.
As a consequence of agricultural clearing of the original natural forest
vegetation there are extensive views across the site from
Brooke Street and
Pardoe Road to the coastal dunes. Future industrial developments have the
potential to interrupt those views, although
building heights may be limited by
planning controls required for protection of airspace near the Devonport
Within the Latrobe Planning Scheme the MRIE is currently zoned Special Purposes
and Rural A with buffer area overlays, for waste
water treatment plant and
aircraft operation reasons, over most of the land. Land to the east is zoned
Light Industry along Pardoe
Developmental Road and Rural A beside the coastline.
The Light Industry zone is largely undeveloped.
Available infrastructure in the vicinity includes gas, electricity, water,
sewerage and the roads network. Water and sewerage infrastructure
may need to be
upgraded and the Councils foreshadowed that headworks charges may be required
from developers of the MRIE.
Port Sorell Road and Pardoe Road are Category 2 (Regional Freight Road) State
Roads between the Bass Highway and the airport access
road. Sections of Brooke
Street are controlled by each relevant Council. All these roads are part of the
State’s gazetted High
Productivity Vehicle Network.
Brooke Street and Pardoe Development Road join Port Sorell Main Road at a
four-leg roundabout at the southern extremity of the MRIE.

Council’s Responses to the Representations
The concerns raised are non-specific and thought to be covered by
responses to other representations
Re: Airport Protection - Tasports has not objected and has itself had
land zoned for light industry. Clause 7.7 of the planning scheme
controls over land within the 25 ANEF contour, or within 3km of the airport,
including referral to (what is now) Tasports
or 15 m (depending on location) or obstacles that might interfere with airport
lighting, navigational
equipment or flight paths.
Re: Pardoe WWTP – Council recommends that the current Pardoe Waste Water
Treatment Plant Buffer be retained in the Latrobe
scheme and that Standard
S15.5.3 be removed from the draft amendment.
Re: Road Network – On traffic engineering advice the road network is
capable of supporting the MRIA.
Re: Watercourse Protection – Pollution and sedimentation risks will be
controlled by permit conditions. A 10m wide riparian
buffer is considered
sufficient.
Re: Landscaping – A 20m wide, high landscape buffer is now
recommended.
Re: Climate change – Most land is above 5m AHD and considered not affected
by sea level rise. Clause S15.6.12 seeks to protect
the dune system from long
term changes due to development.
Re: Dune system – The dunes are incorporated into the Environmental
Management Area and activity in this area is directed towards
conservation,
protection and sustainability.
Re: Environmental and Coastal Values – The issue will be addressed by the
Environmental Management Area within the MRI zone
and site specific controls on
development to protect threatened vegetation and fauna.
Re: Conversion of Rural Land – Conversion is seen as being to a more
effective and efficient use, including Controlled Environment
Agriculture. The
Class 4 agricultural land is not seen as locally or regionally significant and
fettering of agricultural use south
of Brooke St is not anticipated.
Re: RMPS Objectives – The draft amendment is seen as consistent with the
RMPS. The site is not used for recreation, and there
will be buffers and
landscaping around the perimeter. There are no heritage items on the
Traffic engineering advice is that the MRIZ will not affect the
safety of children. The majority of heavy traffic will be directed
towards Port
Sorell Main Road. The western entrance to the zone at Brooke Street will carry
30% of the traffic and will be delivering
to the smaller light industrial
portion of the site. The school bus stop is not an official bus stop which could
be relocated if
assessed as unsafe. The Pardoe WWTP will be upgraded. Industrial
emissions will be controlled under EMPCA.
Similar response to that given for #3 in regard to climate
: The traffic engineering advice was that the road network could
accommodate future traffic growth. Access to the MRIZ would be only
collector road junctions (possibly roundabouts) with Pardoe Developmental Road
and a further junction on Brooke St., 300m
west of the existing roundabout. A
clearer wording of Clause S 15.6.2 was recommended. Sites within MRIZ may only
be accessed from
internal roads. Any required road widening would be obtained by
negotiation with abutting owners. A 15m wide landscaped buffer was
thought to be
adequate but a 20m width would also be acceptable. The vegetation buffer would
not block views further afield. Amenity
of residents would be safeguarded by
allowing only low impact industry within 500m of residences and by applying the
provisions of
EMPCA. Property values were not expected to be

Reasons for the Decision
Issue 1: Demand, supply, location and suitability
of industrial land.
The demand for industrial land
in the Devonport region has been reported on by various consultants over the
last six years (Lester
Franks 2003, Pitt & Sherry 2003, SEMF 2005, SGS
Economics and Planning 2008, Hydro Consulting 2008) and a perceived shortage
suitably located and serviced land was reinforced by Council staff at the
Latrobe reported that there were emerging shortages of suitable industrial land.
Some zoned land was unserviced or not appropriately
located to satisfy market
interest. Expansion of the existing industrial estate near the town of Latrobe
was constrained by the presence
of threatened vegetation communities. The
Belfield estate at Frankford Main Road was not serviced. The 30 hectare parcel
immediately
west of the airport, zoned for light industry, could not be
developed due to lack of suitable access. However, it was envisaged that
MRIE road network had the potential to provide connectivity to that light
industry zone.
The SGS report to the Department of Economic Development (DED) projected, for
each Tasmanian region, the area of industrial land
required in the period
2006-2011 to cater for local service industries (related to population growth
rates) and export oriented
industries (related to employment growth rates). For
the Burnie-Devonport region the greatest land demand was estimated at 15.2
for local service industries (recent trend continuing) and 96.9 ha for
export oriented industries (high estimate). However, even
low growth projections
implied a regional demand for 82 hectares of land in
The export led
demand is the more significant. The high growth demand scenario assigned 25.6 ha
for Devonport and 10.7 ha for Latrobe
for export industries whereas local
service industries were projected to require 2 .8 ha and 3.3 ha
respectively.
DED supplied detailed information about Controlled Environment
Agriculture
advised that the site was particularly well located for this type of export
industry due to its topography, mild climate, services
(especially water and
gas) and proximity to ports and a workforce. Mr Jarvis advised that there was
investor interest in establishing
a 4 hectare CEA operation which if successful
could be replicated across other parts of the MRIE.
It is considered that, subject to some qualifications that will be discussed
later in this decision, the draft amendment provides
an appropriate strategic
location for some forms of industrial development. The MRIE site has the
advantages of proximity to ports,
reticulated services of water, sewer,
electricity and gas and ready access to the State Road network. The potential
for Controlled
Environment Agriculture clearly has significance for export led
demand for land.
Even so, the amount of land proposed to be developed has not, in our opinion,
been sufficiently justified by the analysis of projected
supply and demand.
Assuming the adjacent, undeveloped, 30 ha light industry zone (Tasports) is
included as potentially available,
then the combined developable area is
approximately 169 ha (139+30), from which perhaps 20% can be deducted for roads
and service
easements, leaving a net area of around 135 hectares. The 5-year
period demand identified by consultants SGS for Devonport and Latrobe
36.3 ha for export industries and 6.1 ha for local service
industries.
It is considered that the extent of land immediately available for development
within the rezoning should be reduced at this time
to the southern and western
sectors of the MRIA, (as suggested by Hydro Consulting) but without foreclosing
on options for an eventual
northward extension, staged in accordance with a long
term outline development plan, and as justified by expressed
Issue 2 Coastal development etc
The amendment includes, within the MRIA all the private land, comprising 4
titles, bounded by the State coastal reserve, the Devonport
municipal boundary,
Brooke Street, Pardoe Road and the Tasports’ lands around the airport. The
coastal reserve is only 30 metres
wide. Land within the coastal dune system is
proposed to be included in an Environmental Management Area. The common standard
climate change in the amendment sets a minimum floor level of 2.9m AHD
(Australian Height Datum), although on Council’s evidence
that would be
below the predominant ground level of the site.
The Hydro Consulting report recognised that the environmental and cultural
values of the coastal strip required protection and recommended
that a corridor,
extending 300m inland from the coast be excluded from development, to enable
protection and further investigation
of aboriginal cultural heritage. The site
analysis plan shows two ‘cultural and environmental values’ sites
that include
the dune system and the lower reaches of Pardoe Creek. The coastal
zone shown is variable in width but approximately 100m wide. The
limitation surfaces associated with flight paths from the airport are also shown
as extending over the northern part of
the MRIE. (See Figure 2)
Senator Milne and others at the hearing alluded to the risks of climate change,
sea level rise and coastal inundation. Senator Milne
referenced several
Australian planning appeal decisions in which coastal development had been
refused on the basis of climate change
The Sharples Report
referred to by Senator Milne and others, provides guidance about the
vulnerability of coastal landforms to the potential consequences
of sea level
rise. The report specifically maps (at Appendix 1, p.133) the Turners
Beach-Northdown Beach segment of the coastline
and characterises the MRIE
coastal strip as “Open sandy shores backed by low sand plains –
erosion + recession vulnerability”.
However it was noted by representors
that scientific evidence compiled since 2006 suggests that the rate of sea level
rise may be
faster than previously thought.
The Commission has digital maps of coastal areas that are at risk from sea level
rise. These are based on Sharples’ models
of coastal vulnerability. The
MRIE section is shown in Figure 3 below, overlain on a Google aerial photo. The
yellow line encompasses
areas of potential flood vulnerability from the maximum
predicted sea level rise in 2100. (Due to scaling differences the position
the line is indicative only, not definitive, and requires detailed on-site
verification.)
Figure 3. Extent of coastal vulnerability. (Source: RPDC)
It should be noted that the Pardoe WWTP is within the vulnerable
The amendment recognises, to some degree, that development should be restricted
in the coastal zone. Following the line of the ‘coastal
zone’ in the
site analysis map, the amendment sets aside an ‘Environmental Management
Area’ of variable width (~100m)
adjacent to the Crown coastal reservation.
The extent of the Environmental Management Area is shown on the amendment plans
continuous across the municipal boundary. A ‘General Impact
Area’ and a ‘Low Impact Area’ are also shown
The only uses permitted in the Environmental Management Area are Utilities and
‘Natural and cultural values management’.
The latter term is defined
use of land to protect, conserve and manage ecological systems,
cultural sites or landscapes
Utilities is defined as: - “
use of land for :
(a) telecommunications; or
(b) transmitting or distributing gas, oil, or power; or
(c) transport networks; or
(d) collecting, treating, transmitting, storing or distributing water;
(e) collecting, treating, or disposing of storm or floodwater, sewage or
Examples are a gas, water or sewerage main; electrical sub-station; power
line; pumping station; retarding basin; road; railway line;
sewage treatment
plant; water storage dam; storm or flood water drain and
The definition of Utilities would include the existing waste water treatment
plant but would also allow (as permitted status without
qualification) many
other types of works that could be inappropriate in a sensitive coastal
environment.
There are some difficulties with Council’s approach to this issue. First,
the Environmental Management Area is not considered
extensive enough to protect
the cultural and environmental values identified by Hydro Consulting or to
prevent development on areas
of potential hazard due to sea level rise and storm
Second, the boundaries of the Areas are not readily identifiable on the ground
by title boundaries, fences, contours, survey lines
or physical features. The
nominated, free-form Area boundaries could be difficult to reconcile with later
subdivisional boundaries
and could lead to confusion about the permissible uses
on particular lots.
Third, there are no statements of intent or objectives to distinguish the
desired outcomes for the three Areas or guide the exercise
of discretion within
the MRIE. The intent can only be presumed from comparison of the various Tables
of Use. This is not considered
to be sufficiently clear to establish a staged
development strategy, locate proposed infrastructure or guide applicants seeking
permission.
Fourth, the scope of permitted Utilities, as defined, is such that uses or
developments that may adversely impact upon environmental
and cultural values in
the Environmental Management Area, could not be refused. The two use classes
proposed to be permitted in the
Area are potentially incompatible but the risk
can be minimised by an appropriate qualifying statement in the Table of
It is considered that the boundaries of the three Areas within the MRIE should
be modified and that an Outline Development Plan should
be prepared for the MRIE
+ adjacent light industrial zone. Objectives should be formulated to guide use
and development within the
Areas as indicated in the discussion of Issue
The recommended Area boundaries may be refined in the light of more detailed
site investigation. The aim is to make the boundaries
identifiable on the ground
and more easily capable of incorporation into possible subdivision
Issue 3. Transport infrastructure etc
(a) Road Network
The Council relied on the Traffic Assessment prepared by Milan Prodanovic,
attached as Appendix 5 to the Hydro Consulting report.
Mr Prodanovic’s
analysis of the existing traffic situation was summarised in the Background
section of this decision.
In regard to the proposed industrial estate, the Traffic Assessment used a
figure of 28 employees per developed
to estimate
that full development of 112 hectares would result in up to 3,136 people being
employed within the MRI estate. Total
daily traffic generation would be in the
order of 6,800 vehicles (6,000 cars, 800 commercial vehicles), with an afternoon
total of 1,085 vehicles.
Representors were especially concerned about the current situation in Brooke
Street, including its width, certain bends that were
regarded as dangerous, the
risk to users of the childcare facility and the volume, speed and type of
traffic (which includes B-doubles).
The Council advised that Brooke Street would
be widened and that new access point designs would be assessed by Council
at the development application stage.
The location of access roads into the industrial estate could significantly
influence the proportion of traffic flowing to the Bass
Highway via either
Brooke Street or Port Sorell Main Road. Subject to several assumptions about
traffic origins and destinations,
the traffic assessment suggested that by
locating the principal access roads not more than 300m west of the Port
Sorell/Brooke Street
roundabout, most of the industrial estate traffic could be
encouraged to use Port Sorell Road as a preferred route to the Bass Highway.
Nevertheless, the traffic assessment forecast that over the next 15 years, 10%
of employee traffic (i.e. 600 vehicles per day) could
be generated from East
Devonport and around 15% of the commercial traffic (120 vpd) would travel to and
from the East Devonport port
area via Brooke St/Tarleton Street.
The suggested access location is reflected in identical standards (in tabular
form) for the MRIA (Clause S15.6.2) which state: -
“Objective: To ensure that traffic movements to and from the MRIA occur at
appropriate locations.
Performance Criteria – P1 No performance criteria.
Acceptable Solution – A1 Access to the MRIA is limited to:
(1) A primary intersection located off Brooke Street at a distance of
approximately 300m west of the Brooke Street/Port Sorell Main
Road/Pardoe
Developmental Road intersection; and
(2) A secondary intersection to be located along Pardoe Developmental Road;
(3) A secondary intersection off Brooke Street serving the Area at the western
end of the MRIA without road connectivity with the
remainder of the MRIA.
Performance Criteria - P2 No performance criteria
Acceptable Solution A2 All lots are accessed from roads wholly located within
The modification proposed by Latrobe Council, (shown with text struck through)

possibly in the form of a roundabout to be located

A secondary intersection off Brooke Street serving
the Area at
the western end of the MRIA without road connectivity with the remainder of the
The concerns with this approach and the proposed road network standard are that:
(a) Although the Council reported that the Department of Infrastructure Energy
and Resources had been consulted and had endorsed
the traffic assessment, no
written confirmation from DIER, that the proposed access points to the State
Road are acceptable, has
(b) The approach takes the existing network as a satisfactory
‘given’, notwithstanding the crash history in Brooke Street,
presumes that a major industrial estate, generating significant traffic volumes,
can be successfully grafted on to it merely
by specifying the new access points.
(c) Opportunities to improve the network, through design of the industrial
estate, do not to appear to have been explored. Furthermore,
the specification
of only one acceptable solution and the absence of a performance criterion may
be premature and preclude any other
network design alternatives from being
considered.
(d) Acknowledged problems in providing access to the adjacent light industrial
zone have not been addressed by the amendment but
left to future development
applications to resolve, if possible.
(e) Conflict perceived by residents, between industrial traffic and residential
uses in Brooke Street, may be exacerbated.
(f) The modification suggested by the Council introduces a degree of uncertainty
(g) The proposed standards for development that allude to ‘a development
plan’ deal only with subdivision and could be
read as a requirement for
each application separately, rather than an integrated plan for roads,
infrastructure, land use and the
protection of identified environmental and
cultural features.
b) Airport operations
Signatories to Mr Walker’s representation were concerned that some food
processing industries could generate wastes that would
attract birds to the
industrial estate, thus raising the level of hazard to aircraft. Concern was
also expressed about the location
of occupied buildings under flight paths and
the risk of electrical interference from industrial use affecting aircraft
and safety. No expert evidence was presented to support or refute
those concerns.
It is considered that the amendment standard for Airport Protection (S15.5.1) is
sufficient to address the concerns raised by representors.
Acceptable solution
A1 requires a use not to increase the presence of birds and acceptable solution
A4 prohibits interference (and
this can be taken to include electromagnetic
interference) with the airport’s or aircraft navigation or communication
facilities.
Modifications to Area boundaries previously mentioned will reduce
the potential for building within the obstacle limitation areas
(c) Other infrastructure
Devonport’s waste water treatment plant (the Pardoe WWTP) also accepts
effluent from the Latrobe sewerage system at times of
low load, usually
overnight. When the WWTP is running at full load, Latrobe wastewater is delayed
in a holding tank. Devonport Council
advised that the capacity of the treatment
plant is 600l/s and the outfall pipe had a capacity of 900l/s. Devonport Council
that the plant’s capacity could be increased to 900l/s as and when
Representors were concerned that the WWTP was basically a primary treatment
mixing plant rather than a secondary treatment plant,
and that effluent from
some potential industrial uses, e.g. an abattoir, would exacerbate existing
odour problems and possible pollution
of coastal waters.
It is understood that Devonport has an effective trade waste policy that
prevents excessive loadings on the treatment plant. The
questions of required
capacity, standard of treatment and control of emissions will be matters for the
newly formed regional servicing
authority, Cradle Water, to address. This
authority will need to be involved in site planning for the
The certified amendment proposed to delete the current buffer area around the
treatment plant and to substitute development standards
to control emissions and
prevent detrimental impacts on persons or products in premises located within
500m of the WWTP. However,
in its report pursuant to
of LUPAA, Council
recommended retention of the buffer area and the removal of clause S.15.5.3 of
the certified amendment. Those proposed
modifications are
acceptable.

Conclusions concerning strategic planning, road network and
infrastructure
It is considered that in the long term development of a major industrial estate
it is not desirable to jump from a broad brush zoning
to the assessment of
individual development applications without an intermediary step to plan the
overall layout and infrastructure
required. This site is sufficiently large, and
the various issues to be resolved are sufficiently complex, to warrant a
master planning exercise to formulate an Outline Development Plan
An ODP should be inserted in the current planning scheme. The draft amendment
should be substantially altered to require the preparation
and adoption of an
ODP prior to consideration of applications for use or
development.
The conclusion on these issues reinforces the desirability of the State
Government, infrastructure providers and the two Councils
initiating a master
planning exercise for the transport network, infrastructure extension/expansion,
subdivision layout and the location
of uses, to precede the acceptance of
development applications. That master plan should be formulated and presented
for inclusion
in the draft amendment.
Issue 4 Drafting of the amendments
The amendment has been drafted in collaboration with Devonport Council in the
form of a schedule which serves as a kind of ‘mini-scheme’
MRIE with its own statement of purpose, use class definitions and standards for
use and development. It is equivalent to
a ‘Strategic Industrial
Zone’ in the Template endorsed by the
Commission.
This format should assist the
later translation of the provisions into a new planning scheme for the region or
each municipal area
within the region.
The distinctions between the proposed Low Impact, General Impact and the
Environmental Management areas are not considered to be
sufficiently clearly
explained in the amendment and, as previously noted, the boundaries of these
areas could prove problematic.
It is considered that S.15.4. could be expanded along the following lines.
(New) “ S15.4.2 .
The Low Impact Management Area is intended to allow
for a limited range of industrial and related activities that will not have
detrimental
effects on residential uses in the vicinity.
S15.2.2 The General Impact Area is intended to allow for industrial and related
activities at locations that are unlikely to generate
adverse impacts on
residential amenity or the environment.
S15.4.2.3 The Environmental Management Area is intended to allow for the
investigation and protection of environmental and cultural
features, and the
avoidance of development in areas that are sensitive or may become affected by
climate change, sea level rise or
storm surge, whilst acknowledging the
continued presence of the Pardoe Waste Water Treatment Plant and the need for
its possible
expansion or upgrading, including the beneficial use of treated
Turning to consideration of permissible uses, with one exception the schedule
adopts the Template’s use class definitions.
The exception is
‘Controlled Environment Agriculture’ for which the definition given
“an agricultural use carried out within some form of built structure
whether temporary or permanent, which mitigates the effect
of the natural
environment and climate. This includes production techniques that may or may not
use imported growth mediums. Examples
of controlled environment agriculture
include glasshouses, polythene covered structures, hydroponic facilities or
This is essentially a subclass of the Resource Development use definition in the
Template. The definition is intended to facilitate
horticulture under controlled
conditions, by way of a qualification in the Use Table, as the only permissible
resource development
use within the MRIE.
There is an unintended consequence of the Council’s suggested definition.
By reference to the general term ‘agricultural
use’, the housing of
birds or livestock in sheds is not excluded, but broad acre grazing or cropping
is prohibited - by way
of omission from the definition and the qualification in
the Table of Use. Poultry sheds and piggeries for example would be permitted
uses in the General Impact Area and discretionary uses in the Low Impact Area.
It is noted that related uses such as intensive animal
husbandry or animal
stockyard/saleyard are not allowed for in the schedule. The impact of, for
example, odours from such uses on
the amenity of other occupants in the zone or
residents in the vicinity could be severe.
It is considered that the definition and Table of Use qualifications should be
modified to exclude intensive animal husbandry and
similar uses but permit the
continuance of broad acre farming until the land is developed for CEA or some
other permissible use.
However, CEA is potentially sensitive to spray drift or
water contamination from chemicals, such as herbicides, so control over this
aspect is desirable.
A possible definition of CEA is: -
“a horticultural use carried out within a built structure whether
temporary or permanent, which mitigates the effect of the
natural environment
and climate. This includes production techniques that may or may not use
imported growth media. Examples of controlled
environment agriculture include
glasshouses, polythene covered structures, hydroponic facilities or
An appropriate qualification in the Table of Use might be: -
“Only CEA or broad acre farming that does not involve intensive animal
husbandry or use of herbicides.”

WWTP provisions remain.
of the amendment was requested to be deleted.
The Latrobe Planning Scheme 1994 buffer area provisions are:
“7.2 BUFFER AREAS
(i) Buffer areas relate
to premises scheduled under the Environment Protection Act 1973.
(ii) They are areas within which there may be some disturbance from the
operation of the premises scheduled to amenity, offence, health
(iii) Buffer areas occur in a number of different zones. They do not change
the zoning.
(iv) The attenuation distances shown on the plan reflect the area which could
be affected. Within Buffer areas all Permitted as of
right Uses (P1) and all
Permitted Uses (P), for the zone within which the Buffer area is, shall be
treated as Discretionary Uses
It is considered appropriate that these provisions remain in the scheme and that
part 3 of the amendment be deleted. As a consequence,
all use that would
otherwise be permitted remains discretionary within the buffer areas.
The wide scope of the definition ‘Utilities’ has been noted. It is
considered that within the Table of Use for the Environmental
Management Area,
there should be a qualification that allows only a road, a waste water treatment
plant or works necessary for stormwater
management.
The Use Table could be altered to read: -
Defined Use
Qualification
Natural and Cultural Values
Discretionary
Only if a waste water treatment plant, stormwater management works or
The Standards for Development relating to subdivision and the road network
(S11.6.1, S11.6.2) are considered to require modification
to reinforce the
formulation of an integrated Outline Development Plan. However there may be
existing accesses that may be required
to enable access to permissible
development prior to the internal MRIE road network being in place. Provision to
enable existing
accesses to be used should be at Council’s discretion,
with advice from the relevant road authority. The controlling role of
Development Plan can be reinforced by replacing Clauses 11.6.1 and 11.6.2 with
the following: -
“S11.6.1 Subdivision, Road Network and Infrastructure Planning for the
Objective: To guide subdivision, use and development through an integrated
Outline Development Plan to determine the location and
standard of roads, access
points and infrastructure services.
Performance Criteria
Acceptable Solution
P1. Minor variations from an Outline Development Plan in the size or dimensions
of lots or the location of roads or service networks
may be considered where the
variation will not detract from the use and development of the subject land and
the operation of the
MRI Area as a whole.
A1. An application for subdivision conforms to the road network and
infrastructure layout set out in an Outline Development Plan
P2. An existing access point may be used if it does not significantly increase
traffic through the access or adversely affect safety.
A2. All lots are accessed from roads wholly within the MRI
Standard S15.6.3 relates to building dimensions, siting and design.
Acceptable Solution A1 prescribes 10m building setbacks from roads and
watercourses but offers no performance criteria to allow the
setbacks to be
relaxed. This could prove to be unnecessarily inflexible. Provision should also
be made for setbacks for storage and
parking areas and setbacks from water
bodies and wetlands. A performance criterion should be included to encourage
integrated design
of drainage systems.
Acceptable Solution A2 prescribes that office accommodation must be at the front
of a building and incorporate glass as 50% of the
wall area. The corresponding
performance criterion calls for office accommodation to be visible from roads
and present ‘high
quality design’ The basis on which this standard
was chosen is unclear.
AS3 requires waste storage areas, loading bays, utilities and ancillary
infrastructure to be behind the building line. PC3 requires
such structures to
be camouflaged, screened or coloured to minimise visual impact. The potential
interaction with Clause S15.6.9
Landscaping is uncertain and possibly
conflicting.
Without knowing the form of use and development to which it will be applied, the
standard could be considered unduly prescriptive
in its acceptable solutions,
while the performance criteria are considered too vague to assist in exercising
discretion to relax
or waive the acceptable solutions.
A performance criterion should relate directly to the subject matter of the
acceptable solution(s) (e.g. location of a structure)
and not introduce new
concepts or alternative acceptable solutions (e.g. minimising visual impact). It
is considered that the Standard
should be redrafted.
The question of climate change and its impacts over the next century is fraught
with uncertainty about the range of possible sea
levels. From the current state
of knowledge it seems reasonable for Clause 15.6.10 to set a minimum floor level
of 2.9m AHD as a
benchmark higher than anticipated sea level rise, with
provision for variation through a performance criterion. However, development
approvals should not enable excavation that would set permitted ground floors
much below natural ground level. The standard should
Clause S15.6.13 offers no acceptable solution and the performance criterion
given is, “The development does not cause disturbance
to a threatened
species or site of cultural significance.” This is considered to be an
error that would have the effect of
making every application discretionary,
since it would need to demonstrate that the performance criterion would be
satisfied. Various
regulatory authorities may be involved in assessing
compliance with this standard, including the Threatened Species Unit, the Forest
Practices Authority, Aboriginal Heritage Tasmania and the Commonwealth
government.
It is considered that a better form would be: -
“Acceptable Solution A1. The development does not cause any disturbance to
a threatened species, threatened vegetation community
or site of cultural
significance.
Performance Criterion P1. The application must demonstrate that any disturbance
to a threatened species, vegetation community or
site of cultural significance
has been approved by the appropriate authority in accordance with relevant
legislation for the protection
of species, vegetation communities or sites of
cultural significance.”
Schedule 1 Objectives
(a) to promote the sustainable development of natural and physical resources and
the maintenance of ecological processes and genetic
Comment: It is considered that the certified
amendment seeks to promote sustainable development, through recognition of the
and cultural values likely to be present on this large site. More
investigation of the occurrence and location of threatened species
and cultural
heritage will be required as part of more detailed site planning exercises prior
to development. The amendment should
be altered to reinforce the need for those
site investigations and, as part of a precautionary approach, the extent of the
Environmental Management Area should be increased.
(b) to provide for the fair, orderly and sustainable use and development of air,
land and water;
Comment: The draft amendment seeks to promote the fair and orderly development
of a large industrial area, the regional need for
which has been recognised over
many years. However, unresolved issues include the design of an appropriate road
network and service
infrastructure to cater for such a large long term proposal.
The amendment should be altered to include an Outline Development Plan
proposed lands in concert with adjacent lands in the Devonport municipal area.
The presence of residential uses in the vicinity
should be respected through
allocating nearby parts of the site to low impact uses.
(c) to encourage public involvement in resource management and planning;
Comment: The planning process for these amendments has involved an extensive
period of investigation and consultation within the
region. The exhibition of
the amendments and the public hearing provided adequate opportunity for a range
of opinions to be expressed.
(d) to facilitate economic development in accordance with the objectives set out
in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c);
Comment: The amendment seeks
to facilitate significant investment in local and export based industries,
generally in accordance
with the foregoing objectives.
(e) to promote the sharing of responsibility for resource management and
planning between the different spheres of government, the
community and industry
in the State;
Comment: The preparation of the amendment has been an example of co-operation
between adjoining Councils, the State Government
and the community. More
collaborative work remains to be done in planning the road network and services
for the Mersey Regional Industrial
The Schedule 2 Objectives are considered to be capable of being satisfied, in
terms of strategic planning and co-ordinated action
through an appropriate
planning instrument, such as an Outline Development Plan to give consideration
to the provision of infrastructure
and the protection of environmental and
cultural values.
Application of State Policies
State Coastal Policy
The subject land is within 1km of the coastline and the Policy is applicable.
The three guiding principles of the Coastal policy
Natural and cultural values of the coast shall be protected;
The coast shall be used and developed in a sustainable manner; and
Integrated management and protection of the coastal zone is a shared
responsibility.
The draft amendment has been prepared in accordance with these principles but
alterations are considered necessary to enlarge the
Environmental Management
Area and strengthen the protection of natural and cultural
Outcome 2.1.7 of the Policy says, “New industrial development will be
encouraged to locate in specified industrial zones.”
The amendments
provide such a specified industrial zone that can be developed in an integrated
manner to be of regional benefit.
Other relevant outcomes that are addressed
include Outcome 1.2 (referring to Aboriginal sites and relics), 1.4 (coastal
2.1 (coastal use and development) and 3.1 (shared responsibility for
integrated management).
The amendment, once altered as required by this decision, is considered to be
prepared in accordance with the State Coastal Policy.
State Policy on Water Quality Management 1997
The amendment facilitates the development and use of a fully engineered
industrial estate in which water supply, stormwater management
and waste water
disposal should be capable of being integrated and managed to meet the
objectives of the Policy.
National Environment Protection Measures
The National Environment Protection Measures are not considered relevant to the
assessment of the amendments.
Pursuant to
Section 41(a)
Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993
the Commission requires the planning authority to alter the draft amendment
to a substantial degree taking into account the matters
contained in Annexure A,
and to submit the altered amendment to the Commission by 31 December 2009.
