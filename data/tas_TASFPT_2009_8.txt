J Tucker v Forest Practices Authority [2009] TASFPT 8 (27 October 2009)
File No:4/09 F D8/2009
J Tucker Appellant
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was the hearing of an appeal against the refusal of the Forest
Practices Authority to approve Forest Practices Plan MAC 1435
in respect of the
Appellant’s land at Ansons Bay.
The appeal was heard at Hobart on
20 October 2009.
G Wilkinson appeared on behalf of the Forest
Practices Authority.
The Appellant appeared in person.
Practices Plan MAC 1435 was submitted to the Forest Practices Authority for
certification on 26 June 2009. The Plan sought
to clear and convert 1804
hectares of native vegetation to pasture. None of the existing timber would be
harvested, but instead
would be windrowed and probably burnt.
Forest Practices Authority refused to certify the Plan on the basis that it did
not adequately protect threatened species and
vegetation communities, in
accordance with the requirements of the
Forest Practices Code
Forest Practices Act
appeal against the refusal specified no grounds, but at the hearing the
essential basis of the appeal was that the Appellant and
his family had acquired
the relevant land on the basis that they were required to convert it to pasture
in order to maintain, and/or
obtain ownership, under the Government grant on
which they obtained the land.
Forest Practices Act 1985
sets out the basis for approval or refusal of
forest practices plans in section 19(1AA), relevantly reading:
“19. Authority to certify or refuse to
certify forest practices plan
However, the Authority is not to
certify a forest practices plan involving the clearance and conversion of a
threatened native vegetation
community unless the Authority is satisfied of one
or more of the following:
the clearance and conversion is
justified by exceptional circumstances;
the activities authorised by the
forest practices plan are likely to have an overall environmental benefit;
the clearance and conversion is
unlikely to detract substantially from the conservation of the threatened native
vegetation community;
the clearance and conversion is
unlikely to detract substantially from the conservation values in the vicinity
of the threatened
native vegetation community.
"exceptional circumstances" are defined in section 3 of the Act:
"exceptional circumstances"
, that may justify the clearance and
conversion of a threatened native vegetation community, include the need to do
one or more of
the following:
ensure the physical safety of an owner of land or the owner's
relatives or employees;
remove or reduce a
bushfire risk;
respond to a threat
to the State's biosecurity;
protect a rare,
vulnerable or endangered species of flora or fauna;
discharge a
statutory obligation or comply with an order of a court;”
determining an appeal such as the present, the Tribunal exercises the same
powers as the Forest Practices Authority and is subject
to the same statutory
obligations, including those imposed by Section 4C(fb) which provides that the
Authority is:
"to implement the State Permanent Forest Estate Policy, being the policy
referred to in, and developed in accordance with, Attachment
9 to the Tasmanian
Regional Forest Agreement made between the State and the Commonwealth on 8
November 1997."
Policy, as updated in 2007, provides by section 2.2.1:
"Threatened forest communities -- all viable threatened forest communities
are to be maintained other than in those circumstances,
where conversion will
not substantially detract from the conservation of that Forest community or
conservation values within the
immediate area."
Policy provides for the exercise of discretion by the Authority on a number of
grounds, including where:
"substantial private benefits will accrue from the conversion of the
native forest area and the forest area represents only a small
fraction of the
area of that Forest community in the immediate area, and:
-- the loss of the area does not substantially detract from the nature
conservation values of the Forest community in that particular
-- the remainder of the Forest community is adequately protected in the
immediate area to ensure its maintenance as part of the Permanent
Native Forest
Appellant had obtained an ecological assessment of the proposed Forest Practices
Plan area, which was presented in evidence at
the hearing. That assessment was
not contested by the Forest Practices Authority, and is accepted by the
Tribunal. In summary,
the results of that ecological assessment are as

Nature Conservation Act

conversion of the Forest Practices Plan area to pasture would result in the
destruction of those respective forest types and plant
species within the
Panel finds according to the above evidence.
Forest Practices Act
requires that forest practices plans
specify practices to be carried out in respect of clearing of trees, and/or
clearance and conversion
of threatened native vegetation communities; further,
that any specifications be in accordance with the
Forest Practices Code
as in force at the time of the forest practices plan is
D3 of the Code requires that threatened species be managed in accordance with
legislation and processes, including the Commonwealth
Environment Protection
and Biodiversity Conservation Act,
, the Tasmanian
Threatened Species
Protection Act
and the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement.
Practices Officers are also required by Section D3.3 of the
Forest Practices
to obtain management prescriptions for each threatened species that
occurs or potentially occurs within areas proposed for forest
operations.
fauna species for which suitable habitat is present in the forest practices area
proposed, include the Spotted-tailed quoll,

Threatened Species Protection Act 1995

Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
Holland Mouse, which is listed as endangered in the
Threatened Species
Protection Act 1995
; and the Tasmanian Devil, which is classified as
endangered in the
Threatened Species Protection Act 1995

Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
uncontested evidence was, and the Tribunal accordingly accepts, that Forest
Practices Plan MAC 1435 was not in accordance with
endorsed Management
prescriptions for the protection of threatened species.
previously stated, a substantial basis of the appeal was that the Appellant and
his family had acquired the relevant land on the
basis that they were required
to convert it to pasture in order to maintain, and/or obtain ownership, under
the Government grant
on which they obtained the land. This would appear to have
arisen from changes in legislation and policy, both out of the Appellant's
control, over the period since they commenced acquiring the respective portions
of the land comprising the plan area. The Tribunal
does not consider that
circumstance to be "exceptional" within the meaning of Sections 3 and 19 of the
evidence was, and the Tribunal again accepts, that the Appellant would be
substantially better able to operate his and his family's
farming property, if
allowed to convert the plan area to pasture. In particular, the increase
constituted by conversion of the plan
area, would result in an area of pasture
allowing a much greater cattle carrying capacity, with substantial improvements
In order to make findings as to circumstances which would constitute
"exceptional circumstances" within the meaning of Sections
3 and 19 of the Act,
the Tribunal would need more specific evidence than was provided by the
Appellant. The Appellant determined
that it would rely upon the evidence
already given, and accordingly the Tribunal does not find that such "exceptional
circumstances"
exist in the present case.
latter evidence, together with the potential for application for compensation
pursuant to the
Nature Conservation Act

determination by the Tribunal constitutes the evidence with respect to the
financial effect of the
Tribunal's decision. It is not a sufficient basis, the
Tribunal considers, for allowing the proposed Forest Practices Plan in the
of the evidence with respect to the ecological effect of doing
was common ground between the parties, and the Tribunal finds, that of the total
area of 2180 ha in the plan, approximately 1260
ha could potentially be cleared
without adversely affecting threatened vegetation or habitat. Potentially, that
would allow the
Tribunal to amend the Forest Practices Plan accordingly,
allowing conversion of at least that amount to pasture. It was stated for
Appellant and was uncontested, however, that it would not be feasible to utilise
the areas concerned for pasture, because of
the need for fencing, roads and
other infrastructure, together with the scattered nature of the resulting
decision of the Tribunal is accordingly that the refusal of the Forest Practices
Authority to certify Forest Practices Plan MAC
1435, is upheld.
