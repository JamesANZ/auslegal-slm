Response provided by Tandara Lodge received 16 April 2024
Quick and easily identifiable resuscitation protocols for each resident have been implemented with multilevel safeguards which include:
all residents have an updated and approved goals of care form signed including temporary and respite residents;
colour-coded signs in the residents' rooms indicate their resuscitation status;
there is standardised and localised document storage in the common staff area for all residents' goals of care documents;
there is a quick reference system on the registered nurse keyring to identify those residents for resuscitation;
staff education and training has been undertaken to update all staff on the changes made and location of key documents and plan; and
the not for resuscitation section on the staff handover sheet has been removed in order to eliminate it as a potential source of incorrect
information and input error."
In addition to the above, and in line with the recommendation made by the Coroner we reviewed staffing levels and have now created
an additional staff member position on night shifts. This increases the staffing levels on night shift by 50%.
