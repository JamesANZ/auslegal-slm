[1] On 26 June 2007
Titan Sandstone Pty Ltd (“Titan”)
commenced proceedings in the Tribunal seeking various orders including the
of mined sandstone and plant and equipment from ChongHerr Investments
Pty Ltd (“ChongHerr”). Titan’s action is
being strenuously
opposed by ChongHerr. ChongHerr also has a substantial counter-claim against
Titan. The claim and counter- claim
have been set down for hearing together
commencing on Wednesday 12 September 2007 in Brisbane.
[2] This application is brought by ChongHerr under
Resources Act 1989
(“the Act”) seeking an order that Caveat
Number 1009531 (“the caveat”) against Mining Lease 50013 be removed.
The caveat was lodged by Titan on 26 June 2007. Titan opposes the application
for removal of the caveat.
[3] One aspect to be determined at the hearing in September concerns the
ownership of mined sandstone located on the mining lease.
By lodging the
caveat, Titan seeks to prevent ChongHerr from dealing with the disputed
[4] The present application has been the subject of extensive submissions from
Counsel for both parties, for which the Tribunal is
grateful. However, many of
the submissions, such as the interpretation of
of the Act and the many
issues that flow therefrom,
are by their nature key aspects to be determined at
the substantive hearing.
At the end of the day, I have reached the conclusions
that I have on this application without the necessity of determining the bulk
the questions at the heart of the dispute.
[5] An examination of the caveat shows that the caveat applies to the whole of
the 100% interest of ChongHerr in ML 50013. The caveat
forbids the assignment,
mortgage or sub-lease of the mining lease. The right or interest sought by the
caveat particularly refers
to the sandstone in situ on the mining lease mined by
[6] The material before me, together with the details set out in the Court of
Appeal decision between these parties relating to this
shows that the area of the
mining lease previously mined by Titan was limited to 10 hectares of the total
mining lease area of 129.3
hectares. I am in no doubt that the caveat, in
seeking to apply to the whole mining lease (which I find by construction it
to do), is too wide.
[7] Additionally, I can find no justification for the caveat to prevent the
mortgaging of the mining lease by ChongHerr.
[8] It is appropriate that I refer to one aspect of the evidence. Despite the
evidence of Mr Ng in his affidavit of 6 August 2007
setting out his reasons for
delay in taking any action with respect to the caveat once its existence was
brought to his attention,
it remains a strange situation that Mr Ng would not
have sought urgent information about the caveat, particularly given that he was
not aware of who had lodged the caveat. Such lack of action by Mr Ng is also at
odds with his evidence contained in his affidavit
of 31 July 2007 to the effect
that ChongHerr is seeking to sub-lease its interests in the mining lease. I
note that Ms Moody relied
on ChongHerr’s intent to sub-lease the mining
lease as a reason for urgency in bringing this application. Of course, if
is actively seeking to sub-lease the mining lease, such action would
lend some support to the action of Titan in lodging the
[9] A further aspect of this matter which I find rather curious is that the
existence of the caveat does not of itself prevent ChongHerr
from removing the
disputed sandstone from the mining lease in a manner contrary to the interests
claimed by Titan. An interlocutory
injunction would appear to be a better
vehicle for achieving that result. In fact, Titan made an urgent oral
application for such
an injunction during the hearing of this application, but
later in the hearing withdrew that oral application. Of course, if it
possible for Titan to lodge a more restrictive caveat relating purely to the
disputed sandstone on the 10 hectare area, such
a caveat, if effective, may give
some protection to Titan’s interests in so far as it sought to prevent the
sub-lease or assignment
of the disputed sandstone in situ. I make no findings
on whether or nor the Act would allow such a caveat to be
[10] Given my views as expressed above, the question is, what orders should be
made on this application? In this regard, the decision
of the Queensland Full
Queensland Estates Pty Ltd v Co-Ownership Land Development Pty
is of considerable
assistance. In that matter, which related to a caveat under the
Property Acts 1861,
the Full Court found the caveat too wide in its original
form. The Full Court held that the respondent should have leave to amend
caveat within 14 days, and that in default of amendment it should lapse. In my
view, similar orders should be made in this matter.
The Tribunal clearly has
power to make such orders pursuant to
of the Act.
[11] In the circumstances, and given that the final hearing of this matter is
fast approaching, I order that Titan have leave until
4pm Friday, 31 August 2007
to amend its caveat, and that in default of amendment the caveat be
[12] As regards costs, in the circumstances I consider that costs of and
incidental to this application be reserved until the final
determination of the
application and
counter-claim.
