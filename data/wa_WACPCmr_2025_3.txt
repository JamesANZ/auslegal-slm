Reasons for Decision
a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the evidence
relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for
When deciding whether to approve a condition, I am guided by
the following factors:
Is the proposed
condition appropriate, reasonable and proportionate to the risk?
Is the proposed
condition covered under any other law?
Do the parties
agree to the proposed condition?
proposed condition address any of the following factors in the RTA such as:
modification would be unsafe or would make the premises unsafe.
If removing the
modification at the end of the tenancy would not be practical; or would cost
more than the security bond.
The tenant is
making a minor modification on a surface that is tile, exposed brick or exposed
concrete that involves drilling, nailing
or otherwise permanently altering the
surface; and
significant risk of damage from the modification.
condition - Installation of screw/picture hooks to be carried out by a
professional person recommended by the property manager
In their written
submission to Consumer Protection, the landlords expressed concerns that
incorrect placement of screws or picture
hooks by a non-professional could
damage electrical wiring, internet cables, water pipes, masonry, and brickwork.
Additionally, the
removal of these items at the end of the tenancy could require
painting to restore walls to their original condition, with potential
in matching the paint colour.
The tenants stated in their written
submission to Consumer Protection that they have experience retrofitting
[redacted] with custom
wooden and aluminium framing, repurposing them into
[redacted].
The landlords have not provided evidence to demonstrate that
the tenants installing the screws/picture hooks themselves would likely
the damage they are concerned about, or damage exceeding the amount of the
security bond. A security bond of $2720 is held
by Bond Administration for this
The RTA does not require a professional tradesperson to
install screws or picture hooks.
The tenants are responsible for
removing the minor modification and restoring the premises to the same or
similar condition, fair
wear and tear excepted.
The landlords’
proposed condition places a higher requirement on the tenants than what is
required by the RTA.
Considering the information from the landlords and
the tenants, I am not satisfied that installation of screw/picture hooks to be
carried out by a professional person recommended by the property manager is a
reasonable condition to set on approving the tenants’
Requested condition - A receipt provided to landlords noting
how many screws/picture hooks installed in each room
In their written
submission to Consumer Protection, the landlords stated the receipt is to be
provided to evidence the screw/picture
hooks have been installed by a
professional person, giving them peace of mind and ensuring a safe and
damage-free installation.
As the above section outlines, I am not
requiring the tenants to have the screws/picture hooks installed by a
professional person,
so there will not be a requirement to provide a receipt of
completed works to the landlords. The landlords have engaged a property
who can conduct routine inspections of the premise up to four times a year.
Their report can advise the landlords of the
location of the screws/picture
hooks and any potential damages to the premises.
For this reason, I am
not satisfied that a receipt provided to landlords noting how many
screws/picture hooks installed in each room
is a reasonable condition to set on
approving the tenants' request.
Requested condition - Limit the number
and request specific placement of screws/picture hooks.
In their written
submission to Consumer Protection, the landlords raised concerns that refilled
masonry does not have the same integrity
as the original and suggested the
tenants use adhesive wall hooks for additional smaller pictures, to minimise
potential damage.
The landlords then stated that since the front lounge
room is open plan, with two walls that do not have windows, they request only
one screw/picture hook be installed on each of those walls. The landlords also
request a maximum of two screws/picture hooks to be
installed on the
6-meter-long wall from the back door to the storage closet, as that is
reasonable for the space.
The landlords did not specify what they meant
by 'integrity', and have not provide any evidence that the installation of
picture hooks would be to a surface that is tile, exposed brick or
exposed concrete, or that they may permanently alter the structure
of the wall,
or make it unsafe
I am unable to determine definitively that adhesive
hooks cause less damage to walls than screws or picture hooks, as it depends on
the size and weight of the wall hangings. The landlords have not provided
evidence to support this position.
In their written submission to
Consumer Protection, the tenants stated that they wish to hang large prints,
which may be heavy. They
believe screws would better secure the prints and are
concerned that adhesive hooks may fall, rip the paint, and damage the
The landlords have not provided evidence to demonstrate how the
installation and removal of screws/picture hooks would make the wall
why limiting the number is reasonable.
The tenants are responsible for
removing the requested minor modification and restoring the premises to the same
or similar condition,
fair wear and tear excepted.
For these reasons, I
am not satisfied that the landlords limit to the number and placement of the
screws/picture hooks is a reasonable
condition to set on the tenants’
