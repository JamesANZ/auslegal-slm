REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
5 June 2025, I delivered reasons for judgment in this proceeding:
Pty Ltd as trustee for the Post Family Trust v Agrinova Pty Ltd (No 3)
[2025] FCA 587
Agrinova (No 3)
). On 26 June 2025, I made an order
for judgment in favour of the applicant and against the extant respondent
) in the sum of $585,000 exclusive of interest.
8 July 2025, the appellant filed a notice of appeal; and on 28 July 2025, the
respondent filed a notice of cross-appeal.
6 August 2025, I made orders by consent which stayed the order made on 26 June
2025 until final determination of the cross-appeal,
and noted “the
agreement of the parties that any orders for interest and costs in favour of
either party in the proceedings
be stayed on the same terms”.
12 November 2025, I made, relevantly, the following orders:
respondent pay the applicant’s costs of the proceeding, save for the costs
of the applicant’s claim against the respondent
for damages for
contravention of s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law (

Tjeerd Post, be released from all obligations arising from his undertaking to

) being Annexure A to the orders
of Rares J made on 3 March 2023.
Respondent and the former Third and Fourth Respondents (Richard Stott and Mathew
Stott) forthwith do all things and sign all documents
to remove the caveat
lodged by the Respondent over the title to the real property known as 11

sum of $100,000 paid into Court pursuant to order 2(a) made by Rares J on 25
October 2022, together with any interest which has
accrued on that sum, be paid
as follows:
Account Name: Sean Keleher Solicitor Trust Account
application arises in the following context:
(1) on 25 October 2022, Justice Rares ordered the applicant to provide security
for the costs of Agrinova and the Stott respondents
in an amount of $255,000 in
the following tranches:
(a) $100,000 on or before 25 November 2022; and
(b) $155,000 within 30 days of the Court setting the proceeding down for final
(2) on 25 November 2022, the applicant paid the first of those tranches into
Court. The applicant failed to pay the second tranche
of security;
(3) however, on 3 March 2023, Justice Rares made an order, by consent, that the
form of security for the second tranche be varied
such that the “the
undertaking to the Court of Tjeerd Post signed on 27 January 2023 and the
freezing order made today be substituted
as suitable security ...”. The
freezing order was annexure A to the 3 March 2023 orders.
Long, for Agrinova, suggested in submissions that the agreement noted in the
orders made on 6 August 2025 should be treated as
an agreement to leave the
security in place pending the outcome of the appeal and the cross-appeal.
However, I do not regard that
agreement as extending beyond an agreement to stay
any orders as to interest and costs. Thus, it is necessary to consider whether
the security should be released.
starting point is that the purpose of an order for the provision of security for
costs is to ensure that a successful respondent
to a claim will have a fund
available within the jurisdiction of the Court against which the respondent can
enforce a judgment for
costs in that respondent’s favour:
Commissioner
of Taxation (Cth) v Vasiliades
[2016] FCAFC 170
(2016) 344 ALR 558
(Kenny and Edelman JJ).
explained in
Agrinova (No 3)
Agrinova (No 4)
, the applicant
has succeeded as against Agrinova, including as to costs. Although the applicant
is required to pay Agrinova’s
costs of the misleading or deceptive conduct
claim, Agrinova is otherwise required to pay the applicant’s costs. Taking
account the relative time spent on the misleading or deceptive conduct
claim on the one hand and the remaining issues on the other,
the net position is
not one in which the applicant will be required to pay costs to Agrinova. It
follows that, as between the applicant
and Agrinova, the security for costs
order serves no further purpose in this proceeding.
the applicant is liable to pay the costs of the former third and fourth
respondents (
Stott respondents
) with the consequence that the security
for costs order continues to serve the purpose of providing a fund against which
respondents can enforce the costs order in their favour.
is no evidence before the Court as to the amount of costs incurred by the Stott
respondents. Mr Keleher for the applicant submitted
that no costs were incurred
by the Stott respondents separately from the costs incurred by Agrinova, but the
absence of evidence
on this point has the consequence that the Court cannot
reach that conclusion. Doing the best that I can, taking into account the
in the proceeding, the course of the hearing, the observations made in
Agrinova (No 4)
at [52] and applying a necessarily “broad
brush” approach, I have come to the conclusion that some separate costs
have been incurred but that the first tranche will provide sufficient
security for the costs payable by the applicant to the Stott
respondents. Thus,
the second (but not the first) tranche of security should be released.
generally, I do not regard it as appropriate to leave the security in place for
the purpose of providing security for the appeal.
The appeal is a separate
proceeding and an application may be made in that proceeding for an order
requiring the provision of security
for costs: see r 36.09 of the
Federal Court Rules 2011
(Cth). The matters that inform the exercise of
the discretion in deciding whether to require a party to an appeal to provide
for costs for an appeal typically differ from those that inform the
exercise of the discretion at first instance: see
Tyneside Property
Management Pty Ltd v Hammersmith Management Pty Ltd
[2014] NSWCA 417
(2014) 103 ACSR 201
at 212 to 213 [50] (Basten JA). For example, in the present
case there has now been a judgment, there is both an appeal and a cross-appeal,
and the quantum of any order for the provision of security for costs is likely
to be lower in view of the shorter timeframe for the
hearing of the appeal.
the reasons set out above, orders to the effect of the first and second (but not
the third) orders sought by the applicant should
be made. I will make orders
accordingly.

numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment of the
Honourable Justice
