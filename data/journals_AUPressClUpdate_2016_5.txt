MEDIA RELEASE | 26 July 2016
Two more publications join the Press Council
Two more publications have joined the Australian Press Council, adding to the
more than 900 print and online media outlets that have
committed themselves to
the Council’s standards of ethical journalism and its mission to advocate
for press freedom.
The new members are:
• Echo Publications Pty Ltd (publisher of The Byron Shire Echo and
Echonetdaily)
• Independent Australia Pty Ltd (publisher of Independent
The Chair of the Press Council, Professor David Weisbrot, said the new
members are the latest expression of confidence in the Council’s
to address the concerns and interests of smaller and regional publications as
well as those of major publishers in the country.
“It is important for the Council to represent as close to 100 percent
of print and online publishers as possible if we are to
continue successfully to
resist any attempt at government regulation of the free press, whether directly
or by stealth," Prof Weisbrot
said. "Increased diversity of membership also
provides the Council with a richer range of experience and perspectives,
strengthening
our standards of practices and our processes.
“This is why we are increasingly active in encouraging membership from
country and community publications, from the multicultural
press and from new
entrants into online publishing.”
The General Manager of Echo Publications, Simon Haslam, said his organisation
“supports the Council's championing of free media
in the face of
unprecedented government restrictions”.
“We also see the need for an independent media body to handle
complaints in the increasingly fragmented online world,”
Haslam said.
“In these times of technological, social and commercial change, it is more
important than ever that examination
of government and commercial power be
continued by bodies with a commitment to high standards of journalism like The
Echo, in order
that independent views and opinions can continue to be heard
against the cacophony of the Internet and the loud voice of big business
interests.”
The Managing Editor of Independent Australia, David Donovan, said:
“Independent Australia is delighted to join the Australian
Press Council,
which we believe does valuable work enforcing ethics and media standards in
“As a responsible media organisation that has always abided by the MEAA
code of ethics, we welcome the opportunity to now be
formally held to such
standards, as well as this formal recognition of Independent Australia as an
established and fully-fledged
news organisation.”
The Australian Press Council was established in 1976 and is responsible for
promoting good standards of media practice, community
access to information of
public interest, and freedom of expression through the media. Press Council
membership encompasses most
of the major newspaper and magazine publishers in
Australia, accounting for approximately 95 per cent of circulation.
