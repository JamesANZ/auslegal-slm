& Masters, Clifford & Masters, Glenda
[2002] QPAMDT 37
REASON FOR DECISION:
This is a claim by Kim Marie Dalrymple
(“Dalrymple”) under section 119 of the
Auctioneers and Agents Act
(“the Repealed Act”) against the former auctioneers and
agents fidelity guarantee fund (“the former fund”)
on the basis of
an alleged contravention of the Repealed Act by Coolamon Nominees Pty Ltd
trading as Redcliffe Motor Auctions (“Coolamon”)
and Clifford C
Masters (“Masters”), one of the directors of
The claim arose in relation to a Holden
Vectra sedan (“the vehicle”) which Dalrymple gave to Coolamon to
sell by auction.
The vehicle was subsequently sold by Coolamon, and Dalrymple
claims to have suffered a pecuniary loss arising from a breach of the
Act by Coolamon and Masters. She states that Coolamon failed to account for the
sum of $16,500 being the agreed amount
to be applied for her benefit by Coolamon
from the sale of the vehicle.
The claim has become a claim against the
claim fund under the
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
(‘the Act”) by virtue of section 604 of the Act which

the claim against the claim
Dalrymple could have made a claim against
the former fund but did not do so before the Act commenced on 1 July 2002. A
formal claim
was filed on 12 July 2001. Dalrymple stated that she had become
aware of her loss on or about 21 May 2001. The Tribunal is therefore
that the claim is within the time limit stipulated by section 119 of the
Repealed Act and is properly before it pursuant
to the transitional provisions
of section 604 (3) of the Act.
The application was referred to the
Tribunal by the Chief Executive under section 476 of the Act. Notice of the
Claim had been given
to all respondents and in this regard the Tribunal was
satisfied that sections 474 and 475 of the Act had been
While the Tribunal is to deal with this
application under the Act, it must determine the claim based on section 119 of
the Repealed
Act which relevantly provided as
Application of
A&A Act 119.(1)
Subject to this Act, the
fund shall be held and applied for the purpose of reimbursing persons who may
suffer pecuniary loss because

of the claim.

(b) 3 years after the

A statutory declaration from
Dalrymple’s father, John Maultsaid, attesting to the delivery of the
vehicle to Coolamon for auction
on 14 May 2001 was filed with the Tribunal. A
Statutory Declaration from Shayne Julian Culverhouse attesting to the agreement
net proceeds of $16,500 to Dalrymple from the sale was also filed with the
Tribunal. A copy of the Vehicle Purchase Contract evidencing
the sale of the
vehicle on 14 May 2001 to a Chony Moore for the price of $17,800 was included in
the material before the Tribunal.
A Certificate of Registered Interests dated 10
April 2002 from the Office of Fair trading showing a registered mortgage on the
to General Motors Acceptance Corporation (“GMAC”) was also
included in the material before the Tribunal. At the hearing,
Mr Seery tendered
an affidavit from Gregory Allan Downing (“Dowling”) dated 26
September 2002 attesting to the amount
owing to GMAC and Dalrymple’s legal
costs. None of this material was challenged by the respondents.
Discussion and Findings
It was not in dispute that, at the
relevant times, both Coolamon and Masters held a motor dealer’s licence.
The Tribunal is
therefore satisfied that both respondents were a
“prescribed person” under section 119(2) of the Repealed
On the basis of the above undisputed
evidence, the Tribunal finds that the sum of $17,800 was received by Coolamon on
the sale of
the vehicle on behalf of Dalrymple on 14 May 2001. The Tribunal also
finds that the agreement between the parties was that Dalrymple
was entitled to
the benefit of $16,500 from the sale to be applied in part payment of the amount
owing to GMAC.
While it is clear from the evidence
that, under the agreement Coolamon was obliged to apply the moneys in a
particular way, the moneys
instead were applied to its own use and benefit. The
Tribunal is therefore satisfied that Coolamon was fraudulent in so applying
On the basis of this evidence, the
Tribunal is satisfied that Coolamon has fraudulently misappropriated the
proceeds of the sale of
the vehicle and that Dalrymple has suffered pecuniary
loss because of the happening of that event for the purposes of section 119
the Repealed Act.
The amount of the financial
It is clear from the evidence that
Coolamon received an amount of $17,800 for the sale of the vehicle and that
$16,500 of this amount
was to be applied for the benefit of Dalrymple. The
Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the initial amount of Dalrymple’s
financial loss is $16,500.
Dalrymple also claimed as a loss the sum
$456.09 per month for each and every month that she continued to make repayments
Mr Seery submitted that such amounts were part of Dalrymple’s
loss because they were payments in reduction of her liability.
The Tribunal does
not agree with this submission. A letter dated 22 April 2002 from GMAC advised
that the payout figure on the vehicle
at 14 May 2001 was $22, 088-44. This means
that Dalrymple would have been liable to pay a shortfall of $5, 588-44 to GMAC
date of the auction to pay out the mortgage. Downing’s affidavit
of 26 September 2002 states that the payout figure as at 27
September 2002 is
$20,395-95. This means that the shortfall to be paid by Dalrymple has been
reduced to $3,895-95. In the Tribunals’
opinion, the difference between
these two shortfall figures, namely $1692-49, is the amount of Dalrymple’s
loss from the failure
of Coolamon to account for the proceeds of the sale of the
Dalrymple also claimed her legal costs
totalling $5,725-50. Evidence of these was given by copies of tax invoices from
her solicitors,
Saunders Downing Hely dated 11 April 2002 and 26 September 2002.
The Tribunal is satisfied that it is appropriate in this case to
In summary the Tribunal is satisfied
that the amount of the Applicant’s financial loss is $23, 917.99
calculated as follows:
Agreed proceeds of
sale $16,500.00
Shortfall difference $ 1,692.49
Legal Costs

As Coolamon is under administration,
Dalrymple may become one of its unsecured creditors. The Tribunal drew to Mr
Seery’s attention
the provisions of section 493 of the Act whereby a
claimant is obliged to notify the Chief Executive of any amount or benefit
by the claimant, other than an amount from the fund, in relation to the
claimant’s financial loss, whether before or after
the claim is
On the basis of the above findings, the
Tribunal allows the claim under section 530 of the Act and orders that the Chief
of the Department of Tourism, Racing and Fair Trading pay Dalrymple
the sum of $23,917-99. The Tribunal makes no order as to the
date of payment
due to the requirement of section 489 of the Act that the Chief Executive shall
not pay the amount until the end
of the period allowed for appeal, and if there
is an appeal, until the appeal is finally decided.
Under section 488(3)(c) of the Act, if
the Tribunal allows a claim it must “name the person who is liable for the
financial loss”. The Tribunal finds, on the basis of the
evidence, that both Coolamon and Masters are liable for Dalrymple’s
financial loss. The Tribunal must also consider the liability of the third
respondent, Glenda Masters. In this regard, it must consider
Section 125 of the
Repealed Act.
Under Section 125 of the Repealed Act,
the directors of a corporation, at the time when the act that gave rise to the
claim occurred,
are jointly and severally liable to compensate the fund in
respect of any payment in settlement of the claim. The Tribunal finds
section applies to the third respondent who was one of two sole directors at the
time of the auction.
The claim will be paid out of the claim
fund by virtue of Section 604(2) of the Act but the amount can be recovered by
virtue of Section
604(1) which states as
The rights and liabilities of the former
fund are taken to be the rights and liabilities of the claim
This allows the Chief Executive to
recover monies paid out of the claim fund as a liability of the former fund
under the provisions
of the Act. The rights of the former fund to recover from
Glenda Masters are therefore taken to be the rights of the claim fund.
that the former fund no longer exists is irrelevant.
In accordance with Section 488 of the
Act, therefore, the Tribunal finds Coolamon Nominees Pty Ltd trading as
Redcliffe Motor Auctions,
Clifford Masters and Glenda Masters are the persons
liable for the Applicant’s financial loss of
$23,917.99.
The Tribunal orders that the
Respondents, Coolamon Nominees Pty Ltd trading as Redcliffe Motor Auctions,
Clifford Masters and Glenda
Masters are jointly and severally liable for the
Applicant’s financial loss of $23,917-99 and that they reimburse the claim
fund in the sum of $23,917-99 in accordance with Section 530 of the
