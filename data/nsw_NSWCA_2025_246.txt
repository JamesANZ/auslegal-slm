JUDGMENT – EX TEMPORE, REVISED 13 NOVEMBER 2025
respondent is 101 years old. She resides at a residential aged care
facility in Lane Cove. The applicant, who until very recently
self-represented in this Court, is her granddaughter. The applicant is now
represented by a firm of solicitors. On 12 August
2025, the applicant
filed a summons seeking leave to appeal from a decision of Hammerschlag CJ
in Eq given on 8 May 2025 to which
I will return below.
notice of motion filed on 21 October 2025, the respondent seeks an
order that the summons filed on 12 August 2025 be dismissed.
There is power to do so pursuant to
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005
), rr 12.7(1) and 51.1(3), on the ground that the
applicant has not prosecuted the proceedings with due despatch. Alternatively,
respondent seeks an order that the appeal be expedited. The respondent
also seeks her costs.
material before me on the notice of motion is largely contained in an affidavit
of the respondent's solicitor, Ms Sewell, made
23 October 2025. Annexure I to that affidavit consists of
the applicant's written submissions dated 20 October 2025, which
attaches a number of documents including medical certificates from the
applicant's doctor. The material discloses the following
background to the present application.
2022, the respondent commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court against the
applicant seeking, amongst other things, the removal
of a caveat that the
applicant had caused to be lodged on the respondent's unit at
Burns Bay Road in Lane Cove. Those proceedings
were settled
in December 2022 on the basis of agreed orders that provided for the
removal of the caveat. The applicant also gave
an undertaking to provide
various documents regarding the proceeds of sale of the respondent's sale of her
respondent then commenced some form of proceeding in 2023, alleging that the
applicant was guilty of contempt on the ground that
she had not complied with
her undertaking. In April 2024, the contempt proceedings were resolved on the
basis that the applicant
was ordered to pay the respondent's costs.
December 2023, the respondent commenced a further set of proceedings against the
applicant seeking, amongst other things, an order
that the applicant give an
account of the net proceeds of sale of her prior home at Elizabeth Parade, Lane
Cove. Those were the proceedings
that came on for hearing before Hammerschlag CJ
in Eq on 8 May 2025:
Gladys Carol Jones v Traci Haelli Jones
[2025] NSWSC
By the morning of the hearing, the parties had agreed to resolve all issues
other than the account. His Honour said at [3]:
"Because of the plaintiff's very advanced age and what, in absolute terms might
be regarded as not a particularly large sum of money
in dispute (in the context
of the jurisdiction of this Court), I brought the proceedings on for hearing
quickly and conducted the
accounting myself, with the cooperation of Counsel on
both sides who agreed to a summary procedure which I implemented to get the
hearing done expeditiously."
Honour gave reasons ex tempore, stating at [2] that the respondent had sold the
house, which yielded net proceeds of $588,969.33,
which had been paid into the
applicant's bank account. His Honour noted at [6] that it was not disputed
that the money was beneficially
owned by the respondent, and said that at least
an evidentiary burden rested on the applicant to establish that she had spent
money lawfully, within authority or for the benefit of the respondent.
His Honour said at [11] that a disturbing feature of the
case was that a
significant portion of what had been spent could not conceivably have been for
the benefit of the respondent, such
as the applicant’s overseas travel
expenses and a number of other items.
Hammerschlag
CJ in Eq conducted the accounting by reference to a schedule of payments that
had been created by the applicant (see
at [8] and [14]). His Honour
awarded various amounts to the respondent, the result of which was to be seen in
the annexure to his
Honour's reasons. His Honour concluded that
the respondent was entitled to judgment for $223,178.24 (at [14]), with interest
9 December 2022, being the date of certain orders made by
Kunc J in the related proceedings about the caveat (see at
[15]-[16]).
His Honour also ordered the applicant pay the
respondent's costs on the ordinary basis until 19 December 2023 and thereafter
the indemnity basis.
have been informed this morning, without objection, that very little of the
judgment debt of $223,178.24 has been paid to date,
and that the costs the
subject of the costs order are in a very substantial amount, running into the
hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and that those costs have not been paid.
It is to those orders that the summons for leave to appeal, which plainly
requires amendment,
is apparently directed.
applicant. The applicant sought a stay of the garnishee orders.
application came before Richmond J as Duty Judge on
4 July 2025. On 11 July 2025 the applicant's notice of
motion seeking a
stay was dismissed and the Court ordered that if the applicant
had not filed an appeal from the decision of Hammerschlag CJ in Eq
before 8 August 2025 the applicant was to pay the respondent's costs
of the notice of motion.
applicant apparently filed a notice of intention to appeal, but did not serve it
on the respondent within 28 days of the date
of Hammerschlag CJ in Eq's
applicant filed the summons for leave to appeal on 12 August 2025. By UCPR, r
51.12, the applicant was required to file and serve
a White Folder containing
various documents, such as a summary of the applicant's argument, together with
the summons for leave to
appeal. The applicant did not do so. Nor did she
separately file the documents required by the rule. On several occasions
September 2025, the solicitors for the respondent sought service
of the summons and the White Folder, to no avail.
19 September 2025, the applicant was ordered to file and serve an
amended summons seeking leave to appeal and the White Folder
8 October 2025. The applicant failed to do so.
13 October 2025, the applicant was ordered to file the amended summons
seeking leave to appeal and the White Folder by 4pm on
October 2025. The applicant again failed to do so.
have thus been three occasions so far on which the applicant was required to
file the White Folder but failed to do so: on 12
August (as required by the
rules), and on 19 September and 13 October (as required by orders of
the Court).
would ordinarily be a sufficient basis for dismissal of the proceedings for
failure to prosecute them with due dispatch. Having
regard to the respondent's
very advanced age, and the evidence in Ms Sewell's affidavit that the
proceedings have caused anxiety
for the respondent and that the respondent is
being kept out of funds and has taken out a reverse mortgage to finance her
commitments,
there is a very powerful case for exercising the discretion to
dismiss the proceedings.
the applicant explains her delay by reference to the following
(1) There are before the Court several medical certificates dated in the period
from 18 August 2025 until 17 October 2025. These
disclose that the applicant suffers from significant psychological and
physiological conditions and has been recovering from skin-cancer
chemotherapy.
The most recent of these states that in the opinion of her medical practitioner,
Dr Allen, the applicant:
"is presently medically unfit to meet strict Court timetabling, prepare
extensive legal documents, or travel long distances (the
journey from her
residence to Sydney being approximately seven and a half hours each way).
Compelling compliance at this stage would
risk serious deterioration of her
mental and physical health."
(2) The applicant is the sole carer of her partner, who is terminally
(3) The applicant is the full-time carer for two infant grandchildren at
least one of whom has a significant medical condition.
(4) The applicant lives in a remote and isolated location with limited access
to support. The availability of communications, including
Internet access
and transport have been affected by the aftermath of a major flood and storm
event in the area in which she lives
in May and July 2025.
(5) The applicant has experienced a number of difficulties with the registry
online portal, apparently arising out of misspellings
of her name and the
history of the various proceedings to which she has been a party.
her written submissions dated 20 October 2025, the applicant sought a
further 28 day extension until 14 November 2025 to file an
amended summons and the accompanying appeal materials, that is, the White
Folder. Given the applicant's various impediments referred
to above, there
would be serious reason to doubt her capacity to comply with that
the applicant submitted that she had now retained legal representation, that she
was scheduled to meet with appellate counsel
on 21 October 2025 to
review and settle the materials, and that she had obtained the assistance of a
commercial service provider,
Law in Order, to assist with preparation of the
White Folder. In addition, she was represented at the hearing of the
notice of motion
today by a solicitor in the firm which has recently commenced
acting for her.
do not accept the applicant's submission that granting the extension will not
prejudice the respondent, particularly given her advanced
age and the anxiety of
the litigation. However, given that the applicant now has the benefit of
professional assistance, on balance
I consider that it is in the interests of
justice to give the applicant one final opportunity to put her house in
have considered whether to make a self-executing order that the proceedings be
dismissed if the applicant does not comply with the
orders I propose to make.
However, it seems to me likely that such an order would only give rise to a
debate about whether my other
orders had been complied with. The better course
is to stand the matter over to the Registrar to deal with it immediately after
November 2025. The applicant should expect that unless her house
is in order at that point, the proceeding will be dismissed.
parties before me today submitted that it was appropriate that the matter be
expedited, and in the circumstances, I will make
such an order.
Accordingly, I make the following orders:
(1) Order pursuant to
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules
, r 51.60, that the
proceedings be expedited.
(2) The respondent's notice of motion filed 21 October 2025 otherwise
be dismissed.
(3) The costs of that notice of motion be the respondent's costs in the
proceeding.
(4) Direct the applicant to file and serve an amended summons for leave to
appeal and the White Folder in accordance with UCPR 51.12
14 November 2025.
(5) The Proceedings be listed before the Registrar of the Court of Appeal on
17 November 2025.
(6) Grant liberty to the respondent orally to renew her application on
17 November 2025 that the summons filed on 12 August 2025
dismissed, without need to file any notice of motion or otherwise to give prior
notice to the applicant.
(7) Order pursuant to item 7 of
of the Schedule to the
Delegation to Registrars under
Civil Procedure Act
(NSW) made by the Chief Justice on 28 November 2022 that
there be referred to the Registrar of the Court of Appeal the matter referred
in order 6 above, including the power to dismiss the proceedings or make
such other order as the court thinks fit conferred by
UCPR 12.7 and
