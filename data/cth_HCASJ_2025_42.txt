Introduction
an application for a constitutional or other writ and interlocutory relief, the
plaintiff seeks numerous forms of final relief
as well as numerous interim
orders. The final relief sought by the plaintiff concerns the cancellation of
the plaintiff's social
security benefits by the first defendant, the Secretary,
Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The final relief sought
requires an extension of time.
order to achieve the final relief sought, the plaintiff seeks, in effect, to:
(i) quash the decision of the first defendant on
to cancel the plaintiff's Newstart allowance; (ii) quash the decision of
the (then) Administrative Appeals Tribunal
on 24 November 2022 that
affirmed the cancellation decision; (iii) quash the decision of the third
defendant, the Federal Court of
Australia, on 16 February 2024 that
dismissed an appeal from the decision of the second defendant; and
(iv) quash the decision of
the third defendant, sitting as a Full Court, on
5 September 2024, that dismissed an appeal from the decision of
16 February 2024.
is convenient first to address the final relief sought by the plaintiff because
if the application for that final relief should
be summarily dismissed as
vexatious or an abuse of process then there is no utility in any of the interim
relief that is sought or
in the extension of time that is sought.
the reasons which follow, the claim for final relief by the plaintiff is an
abuse of process and should be dismissed. The plaintiff
has thoroughly exhausted
the proper review and appeals process including by an application for special
leave to appeal to this Court.
In some instances, the plaintiff's appeals have
raised many grounds or sub-grounds of appeal. This application is an attempt to
the central issue by seeking relief in the original jurisdiction of
this Court after the appeals process has been
of the lengthy history of this application is summarised in a decision of the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal which was included
in the plaintiff's affidavit
in support of this
application.
abbreviated summary is as follows.
16 December 1996, the plaintiff first received Newstart Allowance.
From 2004, the plaintiff received Newstart Allowance frequently
although the
allowance was regularly suspended or cancelled due to overseas absences.
7 November 2016, the Department of Education wrote to the plaintiff
notifying him that his Newstart Allowance had been cancelled
with effect from
8 October 2016 "because you have not reported".
plaintiff sought internal review of that cancellation decision. On
29 November 2016, an authorised review officer affirmed the
plaintiff then sought review of the decision of the authorised review officer in
the Social Services and Child Support Division
of the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal. On 24 March 2017, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal
affirmed the decision of the authorised
review officer.
plaintiff then sought a second review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. On
29 March 2018, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal
affirmed the
plaintiff then brought an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on questions
of law under
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act
(Cth). The plaintiff alleged 25 questions of law and raised nine
grounds of appeal, each with detailed particulars. On
13 December
2019, the Federal Court (Abraham J) set aside the
29 March 2018 decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on
grounds including
a denial of procedural fairness and remitted the matter to the
Administrative Appeals
24 November 2022, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, on remitter,
again affirmed the 24 March 2017
plaintiff then brought another appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on
questions of law under
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act
(Cth). The plaintiff's amended notice of appeal from the
24 November 2022 decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal
"ten purported questions of law, with many containing a multitude of
sub-issues"; the notice was described as "prolix and, at times,
incomprehensible".
central issue addressed by the primary judge was a denial of procedural fairness
in the making of the 24 November 2022 decision.
16 February 2024, the Federal Court of Australia (Perry J)
dismissed the appeal.
plaintiff then appealed from the Federal Court to the Full Court of the Federal
Court of Australia (Collier, Raper and Shariff
JJ). The plaintiff's
(supplementary) notice of appeal was described as "prolix and, at times,
incomprehensible" and failing "in an
articulate and cohesive way, to identify
the errors [said to be] engaged in by the primary judge". The notice was "65
pages in length"
with "three primary grounds of appeal ... each of [which]
contain[ed] multiple sub-grounds, and some of those sub-grounds contain[ed]
even greater multiple of
particulars".
issue addressed by the Full Court was alleged breaches of the rules of natural
justice by the primary judge. On 5 September
2024, the Full Court
dismissed the plaintiff's appeal.
plaintiff then sought an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal to this Court. That application was refused
by Gleeson and
Beech-Jones JJ on
6 February 2025.
class of claims that are an abuse of process is protean. It extends to "any
circumstances in which the use of a court's procedures
would be unjustifiably
oppressive to a party or would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute".
is usually an abuse of process for a plaintiff to seek to invoke the original
a constitutional or other writ
which circumvents the appeals
circumvention can include cases where the appeals process is not concluded and
the issue can be litigated through that
It can also
include cases, separately from instances of res judicata or issue estoppel,
where the appeals process has been exhausted
and the issue was raised, or even
could have been raised, during that process but an attempt is made to relitigate
the case in original
plaintiff's argument which is contained in materials including the application,
the supporting affidavit, and the reply, is prolix
and difficult to follow. At
one point in the plaintiff's reply, the plaintiff asserts that the central
question on this application
is "whether or not the decision to cancel the
[Newstart Allowance] was vitiated by a denial of natural justice due to
error(s) or otherwise". That issue, or related issues, had been
litigated in the appellate process. So too, as the first defendant
other issues raised in this application have been the subject of submissions and
grounds of appeal by the plaintiff in
the appellate process. Examples are the
alleged lack of a factual basis for an allegation by the first defendant that
the plaintiff
breached a mutual obligation in relation to his Newstart Allowance
and issues concerning
s 605(1)(a)
Social Security Act
ss 68(2)(b)
Social Security
(Administration) Act
(Cth). The plaintiff provides no
sufficient basis for this Court to reconsider issues related to those which have
already been exhaustively
litigated through the appellate process.
the extent that the plaintiff now raises new issues, including objections to the
revised special leave process in this Court or
the termination of the
plaintiff's employment, the submissions do not sufficiently relate to the relief
sought. The plaintiff's submissions
do not disclose any arguable basis for the
relief sought and are vexatious and oppressive and an abuse of process on that
application is an abuse of the process of the Court and the final relief sought
is an abuse of process within r 25.09.3(b) of
High Court Rules
(Cth). The order dismissing this application should be made under
r 25.09.1, and consistently with r 25.09.2 by notification and
publication
of the decision and without listing the application for a hearing. The plaintiff
must pay the first defendant's costs
of this application.
