Formal decision
Child care benefit and child care rebate: whether special circumstances
prevented applicant seeking review within 52 weeks
MCCORMACK and SECRETARY to the DEEWR
Decided: 12th September 2013 by N Bell
McCormack’s daughter was born in February 2007. On 26 August 2008 she
claimed childcare benefit and childcare rebate in respect
of her daughter and it
was granted for up to 24 hours per week of care. On 1 August 2011 she requested
a review of this decision
and Centrelink decided she was entitled to up to 50
hours per week of care because of her disabilities. The decision took effect
from 1 July 2010. McCormack asked for the decision to take effect from the date
of the original decision, 29 August 2008. This was
rejected and McCormack sought
a review of this decision.
Legislation
Section 109D
A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act
(Cth) (the Act) provides that, generally, a person must request a review
within 52 weeks of being notified of a decision.
Section 64EA of the Act provides that where, in a case such as this, an
application for review is made after the end of the income
year following the
one in which the original decision was made, any variation of the original
decision only has effect from the start
of the income year before the one in
which the application for review was made. In this case, the relevant date of
effect was 1 July
Section 109D(2)
recognises that there may be special circumstances that
prevent a person from making an application for review of a decision within
weeks of being notified of an original decision. In such circumstances the
provision allows for an application for review to be
made after the end of 52
The issue in this case was whether McCormack’s circumstances were
special and prevented her from making an application for review
within 52 weeks
of being notified of the original decision.
McCormack gave evidence that following a severe spinal injury in 2006 her
mobility was affected and she suffered intense pain. She
had surgery in 2007 and
was prescribed morphine. She suffered depression, mixed with bouts of anxiety,
until the end of 2009. During
this period she had no sense of how her rent or
bills got paid. She was having suicidal thoughts. She and her husband had
but he stayed nearby to help with their child and to care as best he
could for her.
McCormack recalled telephoning Centrelink in August 2008 to find out what
payments she could obtain in relation to her child. She
was given information
including advice that, because she and her husband were not both working, she
could not obtain the full 50%
childcare rebate. McCormack recalled telling
Centrelink that she was disabled but she said that in the state she was in she
accepted what she was told until she saw her accountant to have her tax
done in 2011 and he questioned why she was not getting the
50% child care
McCormack’s ex-husband gave evidence of her serious physical and mental
health issues throughout 2007 and 2008 leading to their
separation in July 2008.
He told the Tribunal all her bills were addressed to him and he made sure rent
and other necessities were
paid. He did not read her Centrelink letters. He gave
evidence that had his wife read and understood the letter of 29 August 2008
would have raised it with him for assistance in dealing with it.
Ms McCormack’s general practitioner Dr Young gave the following
• McCormack had suffered a lumbar spine injury in 2007;
• she had become reliant on very strong narcotics for pain relief;
• a dosage of narcotic at the level McCormack was taking affects a
person’s ability to think and reason;
• McCormack developed severe depression throughout 2008 and 2009 and
the combination of narcotics and severe depression affected
her cognitive
• Dr Young thought it likely that her husband was assisting her in her
dealings with Centrelink and doubted very much that McCormack
understood matters
fully at that stage as her comprehension was impaired.
Consideration of the issues
The Secretary submitted that the fact McCormack had made contact with
Centrelink on a number of occasions throughout 2008 and had
requested a review
of another decision in 2009 showed she was not prevented from requesting a
review of the August 2008 decision.
The Tribunal considered the evidence of McCormack’s seriously impaired
physical and mental state from August 2008 to August
2009 was persuasive.
Tribunal noted that the decision sought to be reviewed in 2009 was a decision
to suspend her parenting payment which radically affected
her income and that
McCormack assisted her to request this review. The Tribunal noted that this
was not evidence of her ability to exercise her rights
in relation to a decision
The Tribunal considered that in the relevant period McCormack’s
physical and mental condition created circumstances that prevented
making an application under
of the Act for review of the August 2008
decision and she should be permitted to make an application for review of that
up to and including 1 August 2011 in accordance with
Formal decision
The decision was set aside and in substitution a decision was made that
McCormack should be paid arrears of child care benefit and
child care rebate
