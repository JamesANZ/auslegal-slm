Costs orders following the award of nominal
By Romaine Abraham
Subject to limited departures, as a general rule, the unsuccessful party in
litigation will be ordered to pay the costs of the proceeding
of a successful
The rule functions whether
the defendant or plaintiff is determined to be the successful
Fairness requires the party
who unsuccessfully brought or defended the litigation to indemnify the
successful party for their legal
costs, and indemnification, therefore, is the
primary purpose of an award of
In line with the principle underpinning the general rule that ‘costs
follow the event’, the court may make a costs order
in favour of a
defendant where the plaintiff has only obtained nominal
It was observed by McHugh
J in the High Court decision of
Oshlack v Richmond River
that the practice of
awarding costs to a technically unsuccessful party is grounded in acceptance of
the reality that the ‘successful’
party lost the litigation and the
‘unsuccessful’ party won the litigation, in certain cases where
nominal damages are
exception to the general rule that ‘costs follow the event’ in cases
where nominal damages are awarded has been
accepted in Australian common
and, as a result, the
‘event’ will typically be considered ‘as going against’

award of nominal
WHEN A PLAINTIFF AWARDED NOMINAL DAMAGES MAY BE ENTITLED TO COSTS
The decision of
KSG Investments Pty Ltd v Open Markets Group Ltd (No
sets out the relevant
principles regarding the determination of an award of costs in cases where a
plaintiff receives nominal damages.
First, in considering an award of costs in proceedings where nominal damages
are recovered, the discretion to make an award of costs
is always contingent
upon the specific facts and individual circumstances of the case, and thereby
which party, on the basis of those
circumstances and facts, can be correctly
assessed as the successful
Ordinarily, if the primary purpose of the litigation is to ‘establish
or vindicate some legal right’ and not to recover
damages of a significant
quantum, a plaintiff will be deemed the successful party for the purposes of
determining an award of costs,
even if the plaintiff was awarded nominal
The English decision of
Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine
Industries Ltd
suggests that a plaintiff who recovers nominal damages may be entitled to an
award of costs in circumstances where even a ‘part’
of the reason
for bringing the proceeding was to ‘establish a legal right’, and
without regard to the measure of the
In the Victorian Supreme Court decision of
Simply Irresistible Pty Ltd v
the plaintiff
brought a claim in negligence against their former solicitors (the defendants),
further asserting breach of retainer
and a common law duty of
The plaintiff’s
claim in negligence was dismissed and nominal damages in the sum of $1 were
awarded to the plaintiff for the
defendants’ breach of
The defendants
initially relied on an offer of compromise, in the amount of $10,000.00, which
was not accepted by the plaintiff,
to seek costs pursuant to r26.08(3) of the
Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules 2005
However, the
defendants subsequently sought all of their costs, submitting that the plaintiff
was wholly unsuccessful in their action
and that r26.08(3) of the
as a consequence, did not apply.
The Court determined that although the plaintiff received an award of nominal
damages (compared to the amount of $1,452,661.40 claimed)
they had succeeded on
key matters including scope of the retainer and breach thereof, and other issues
that were unnecessary for
the Court to determine, such as failure to mitigate
loss and contributory
negligence.
Justice Kyrou
observed that the award of nominal damages reflected the plaintiff’s
success in establishing its cause of action
in contract, and the fact that the
damages awarded were nominal was not sufficient to justify an order for costs

Justice Kyrou held
that r26.08(3) of the

nominal damages in this
WHEN A PLAINTIFF AWARDED NOMINAL DAMAGES MAY NOT BE ENTITLED TO
Generally, where the primary purpose of a plaintiff is to obtain substantial
damages and nominal damages are awarded, the plaintiff
will not be considered
the successful party of the
litigation.
Allowing a party who
has failed substantively in their action but has achieved a pyrrhic success to
recover their legal costs of
the action would offend current notions regarding
the cost-effective and efficient resolution of disputes within the judicial
Consequently, a
plaintiff who recovers nominal damages will not ordinarily be entitled to the
costs of the proceeding if the main
purpose of the plaintiff, in bringing the
proceeding, was to obtain substantial

proceedings were
brought by the plaintiffs seeking specific performance of a contract regarding
the sale of land.
The defendant
brought a cross claim against the plaintiffs in addition to a cross claim for
damages against the defendant’s
solicitor (the fourth cross
defendant).
Judgment was given
against the fourth cross defendant, with a finding that there had been breaches
of contract.
However, no damages
were established and judgment for nominal damages in the amount of $10 was made
against the fourth cross
There was judgment
for the fourth cross defendant on the negligence claims in tort, some of which

no instance of damage was
The cross claim brought
by the defendant was determined to be for damages only; it was held that the
claim for damages failed substantially
and the ‘event’ went in
favour of the fourth cross
Accordingly, the
defendant was ordered to pay the fourth cross defendant’s costs of the
proceeding.
Although instructive, the facts of each of the decisions discussed
above cannot be viewed as determinative but must be considered in
conjunction with the court’s unfettered discretion as to
