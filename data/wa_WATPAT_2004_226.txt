Appearances
Mr S Bain (Agent) appeared for the Appellant
Ms P Rooksby (Agent) appeared for the Respondent
1. An appeal against the refusal of an application for the development of a
child care centre in this matter came on for hearing
on 21 September 2004 and a
decision was made on that day allowing the appeal with the indication that
approval be subject to conditions
previously suggested by the City of Stirling.
No argument had then been heard on the conditions, so liberty to apply with
to the conditions was granted if the conditions could not be agreed:
[2004] WATPAT 192.
2. The matter was brought back before the Tribunal on 30 November 2004 pursuant
to that liberty to apply to consider one of the conditions
sought by the City of
3. The condition opposed by the appellant concerns a cash contribution to the
cost of previous upgrading of a right of way known
as Cruikshank Lane. The
condition reads:
“A cash in lieu contribution of $8046.00
for the cost of paving and draining the abutting Cruikshank Lane (Right of Way)
be made in accordance with the City’s ‘Development Abutting
Rights of Way’ Policy prior to the issue of Building
4. The appellants say there is no power for the City of Stirling or the Tribunal
to impose such a condition because:
(a) there are no specific provisions of the city’s District Planning
Scheme No 2 (“
”) that empower the city to improve a
condition requiring a cost contribution for the upgrade; and
(b) the condition does not relate to the development, there being no nexus
between the development and the upgrading which occurred
5. It was common ground that the right of way had been upgraded in about 1988
and that since that time the right of way had become
a gazetted street.
6. The City lead evidence to the Tribunal that pursuant to DPS2 it had adopted a
policy that related directly to such a situation
and that under clause 1.3.5.1
of DPS2 it had a general power to impose conditions on a development.
7. The test of validity of a condition is well accepted in planning law. A
condition will be valid if:
(a) it has a planning purpose;
(b) it fairly and reasonably relates to the development; and
(c) it is not so unreasonable that no reasonable planning authority could have
imposed it:
Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment
[1981] AC 578
as adopted by Full Court in
Temwood Holdings Pty Ltd v
Western Australia Planning Commission
[2002] WASCA 10
(2002) 25 WAR 484
and by this Tribunal
Perrymead v Western Australian Planning Commission
(1996) 16 SR
Love v Western Australian Planning Commission
[1999] WATPAT
the Tribunal considered that a determination as to whether a condition met the
criteria that it had a planning purpose
required two
matters to be addressed.
The first was an inquiry as to whether the condition related to any planning
theory or policy
and the second
was whether the condition in question fulfilled
that planning purpose.
9. The City submits that it is beyond question that access to a development is
an issue encompassed by planning theory and policy.
10. This is undoubtedly true but that is not, with the greatest respect,
entirely what this condition is directed to.
11. Access to the proposed development exists and is not required to be altered
or upgraded as a consequence of the approval of this
development. Rather this
condition is directed to a recovery of funds spent by the Respondent in 1988 to
ensure that access was
available to the landowners then adjoining the right of
way and to the public.
12. This is particularly apparent when one understands that the right of way in
question is now a gazetted road the responsibility
for the upkeep of which lies
with the City.
13. Therefore even if the provision of access is a planning purpose it cannot be
said that the recovery of moneys previously spent
is such a planning purpose and
nor can it be said that the conditions is required to achieve such a planning
14. Further, there are real reservations about whether this condition could be
said to fairly or reasonably relate to the development
– the nexus test.
As is evident from the decision in
at 186, the Tribunal
concluded it will usually only be the case that conditions relating to
contributions to upgraded infrastructure
will only relate to a development where
the upgrading is required because of changes precipitated by the development in
15. There was no suggestion that Cruikshank Lane would require further upgrading
as the result of this development but in any event
it is clear that the cost
recovery is not for that purpose.
16. I have some further disquiet arising out of the process whereby the
contribution figure was arrived at. That figure is an estimate
upgrading costs for a right of way rather than a recovery of actual cost
incurred. It seems to me that if the City is
seeking a recovery of previously
spent costs it would have to justify that recovery by reference to the amount
17. In all of those circumstances it cannot be said that the condition meets the
test laid out in
and accordingly approval should not be subject
to that condition.
18. It is implicit in this conclusion that I have formed the view that it can be
within power for the Tribunal and City to impose
conditions requiring monetary
contributions by a developer to upgrading of infrastructure as long as such
conditions meet the appropriate
tests of relevance, fairness and
reasonableness.
