CASES REFERRED TO
THE DECISION
Bellgrove v Eldridge
[1954] HCA 36
(1954) 90 CLR 613
REASONS FOR DECISION
1. BACKGROUND
1.1 The parties entered into a contract on 23 July 2009
for the amount of $16,300 for the Respondent (as Builder) to remove and replace
the roof covering on the Claimant (Owner’s) property at Coolgardie Street,
Bentley. The work was completed in November 2009
but it soon became obvious that
the roof was not watertight and leaks appeared in the back room, lounge room and
kitchen. It became
apparent that the roof was too flat and it was alleged that
there were other issues with the construction which were faulty, particularly
the gutters. The Owner commissioned a report from the Building and Home
Consulting and Inspection Service dated 30 March 2010
(at pages 14-18 of our
papers). An inspection was then carried out by the Builders Registration Board
Inspector on 11 August 2010.
Principally the Inspector found that the pitch of
the roof was only 2.5° when it should have been 5°, and he also found
that the other faults were substantiated.
1.2 The complaint came on for hearing on 19 November 2009. At the hearing the
Builder accepted that it was their mistake for not
checking that the roof had a
suitable angle of pitch. He agreed that work should have stopped the moment that
the error was found,
but instead was completed. However the Builder denied any
liability for the faulty pitch of the roof structure, which had not been
installed by him nor altered by him. In the circumstances an Order was made for
the Owner to have alterations made to the roof structure
and thereafter for the
Builder to make the roof watertight. The photographs at pages 29-35 and 42-49
indicated a very poor standard
of workmanship.
1.3 On 29 January 2011 the Owner wrote to the Tribunal to advise that she could
not get a carpenter just to do the roof structure,
but that the only way to
remedy the fault was for one contractor to do the whole job of removing the
existing roof sheets, remodelling
the roof structure and then replacing the
sheets and making the roof watertight. The complaint was therefore resubmitted
for a further
hearing before the Tribunal. The Builder in a letter of 24
February 2011 advised he was not available on dates in March and April
that the matter had already been heard and determined and by implication could
not be heard again. The Owner filed a fresh
complaint dated 9 March
2. EVIDENCE
2.1 At the hearing on 15 August 2011 the Builder did not
appear. He had made arrangements to visit the Eastern States and forwarded
evidence of photocopies of the tickets. He advised that he had not received the
letter of the Tribunal dated 8 June requesting
convenient dates. No advice was
given as to why no one else in his firm could attend in his absence. In view of
the length of time
which had elapsed since the original work had been done, i.e.
two years, the Tribunal proceeded with the hearing, but took particular
consider the matter from the viewpoint of the Builder.
2.2 The Owner stated that the Builder had to redo the whole roof and referred
the Tribunal to a quotation at page 110 of our papers.
She said that that
quotation only covered the back of the house but not the front roof. She would
even be prepared to receive back
only the amount of $10,000, so that she could
get the roof repaired so that the warranty was valid and also that her insurer
pay for any problems in the house which might appear in the future.
However she left the matter to the Tribunal.
3. CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENCE
It was noted that the Builder was liable for the cost
of repairs and remained so because the first attempt at solving the matter had
not been successful. Further since the whole roof had to be removed and rebuilt
to produce conformity, the cost of the work to produce
that conformity had to be
a reasonable course to adopt – see Bellgrove v Eldridge
[1954] HCA 36
(1954) 90 CLR 613.
As has been noted the Builder has admitted that he had become aware of the
problem while in the process of construction and should
have stopped work
immediately, but did not do so. The total cost of the work had been
$16,300 but with some deletions the Owner had paid the sum of $15,737. She
was now prepared to accept less than that figure to help
to repair the worst
affected section at the back.
The quotation at page 110 had been split up into four sections. The first and
the fourth only were relevant, in that they dealt with
removal of the roof which
included setting up the necessary scaffolding. That figure was $2,900 plus GST.
To then supply and install
new Colorbond roof sheeting and all flashings,
gutters and down-pipes was $9,050 plus GST, or a total of $11,950 plus $1,195 or
final total of $13,145, as against the initial figure of $15,737. One question
was as to whether any of the roof sheeting could be
retained and reused. However
with the faults noted by the Inspectors as requiring a different pitch, the fact
that the overlaps were
facing in the wrong direction and that the centres for
fixing screws were at 2,000mm and not 1,200mm in parts of the roof, indicated
that new sheeting only could solve the discrepancies.
In the circumstances the quotation was considered to be reasonable,
especially given the original poor standards of workmanship. The
$13,145 did not include any costs of repairing the roof structure and so related
only to the work which had been undertaken
by the Builder.
Accordingly an Order was made for the Builder to pay
the Owner the cost of $13,145 within 28 days of the date of the
