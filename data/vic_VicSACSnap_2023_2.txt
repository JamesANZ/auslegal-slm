Sentencing Snapshot 274: Sentencing Trends for Manslaughter in the Higher
Courts of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
manslaughter in the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria (the higher courts)
from 2017-18 to 2021-22.
Adjustments made by the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December
2022 have been incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on manslaughter and other offences is available on
Advisory Council Statistics (SACStat)
The offence of manslaughter applies when a person kills another person in
circumstances where the offender's culpability is less than
that required to
constitute murder.
Manslaughter is
an indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 2,400 penalty
Prior to 1 July 2020, the
maximum penalty was 20 years'
imprisonment.
Manslaughter is a category 2 offence if it was committed on or after 20 March
Courts must impose custodial
sentences for category 2 offences except in particular circumstances.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where manslaughter was the principal offence,
that is, cases where manslaughter was the offence that
received the most severe
Manslaughter was the principal offence in 2.5% of cases sentenced in the
higher courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 88 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of manslaughter.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
manslaughter by financial year. There were 15 people sentenced
for this offence
in 2021-22, down from 20 in the previous year. The number of people sentenced
was highest in 2018-19 (23 people)
and lowest in 2017-18, 2019-20 and 2021-22
(15 people in each year).

were given an immediate custodial sentence.

2017-18 to 2021-22. The

Over the five-year period,
most people sentenced for manslaughter received a principal sentence of
imprisonment (96.6% or 85 of 88
people). All of the remaining people received a
youth justice centre order (3.4% or 3 people).

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the offence of manslaughter from 2017-18 to 2021-22.
The principal sentence applies to a single offence at a
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves multiple charges,
the total effective sentence will be either the same as or longer than the
Principal sentence of imprisonment
All 85 people who received a principal sentence of
imprisonment for manslaughter received a
non-aggregate
imprisonment term,
that is, the imprisonment term was not part of an aggregate
The lengths of these
imprisonment terms are shown in Figure 3. Imprisonment terms ranged from 5 years
to 13 years, while the median
length was 9 years (meaning that half of the
imprisonment terms were below 9 years and half were above).
The most common range of imprisonment terms was 9 to less than 10 years (23

sentenced for manslaughter ranged from 7 years and 7 months
in 2019-20 to 9
years and 6 months in 2018-19. Over the five years, the average length of
imprisonment for manslaughter was 8 years
and 9 months.

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an immediate
imprisonment term of less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole
period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court
has the discretion to fix a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
or more, the court must impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the
court fixes a non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before
becoming eligible for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the
person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
All 85 people sentenced to imprisonment for manslaughter were eligible to
have a non-parole period imposed, and all were given a non-parole
Figure 6 shows the lengths of those non-parole periods. Non-parole periods
ranged from 2 years to 10 years, while the median non-parole
period was 6 years

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for manslaughter face
multiple charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks at
the range of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of manslaughter.
Figure 8 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
manslaughter by the total number of sentenced offences
per person. The number of
sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 8, and the median was 1 offence.
There were 73 people (83.0%)
sentenced for the single offence of manslaughter.
The average number of offences per person was 1.4.
