Serious Offending by People Serving a Community Correction Order: 2022-23
This factsheet identifies the number of people sentenced in 2022–23 for
a serious offence committed while the person was serving
a community correction
order (CCO).
It addresses the
following requirement in
section 104AA
Corrections Act 1986
For each financial year commencing on or after 1 July 2016, the Sentencing
Advisory Council must report for that year the number of
persons convicted
during that year of a serious offence committed while subject to a community
correction order.
A serious offence includes serious violent offences and
sexual offences
Between 16 January 2012 (when CCOs were introduced) and 30 June 2023, there
people serving a CCO. In the 2022-23 financial year,
people were sentenced in Victoria for a ‘serious
offence’ (as defined in
section 104AA(3)
Corrections Act 1986
(Vic)). Of those,
people were sentenced for a serious offence
committed while serving a CCO.

Number of people sentenced each financial year for serious
offending while serving a CCO
Since 2016-17 (the first year of reporting), the
lowest number of people sentenced for committing a serious offence while serving
a CCO was 483 (in 2020–21). This is likely due to the effect of COVID-19
on court operations, reducing the number of cases
dealt with that year.

Estimated rate of contravention of a CCO by serious offending
each financial year
It is not possible to calculate an accurate rate of
CCO contravention by serious offending because the required reference period to
report on is based on the
date of sentence
for a serious offence, not the
offence date
However, in 2022–23, using just CCOs imposed in the three years to 30
June 2023 as a proxy, the estimated rate of CCO contravention
offending was 1.7%, effectively identical to previous years.
Estimated rate of contravention each financial year between 2018-19 and
Financial year of sentence
In 2022-23, courts sentenced 742 charges of serious
offences committed by 516 people who were serving a CCO at the time.
The three most common serious offences in 2022-23 were:
make threat to
kill (216 charges)
burglary (130 charges)
make threat to
inflict serious injury (120 charges)
These have been the three most
common serious offences each financial year since 2016–17. However,
2022-23 is the first year
that aggravated burglary has overtaken make threat to
inflict serious injury as the second most common serious offence.
Courts sentenced very few homicide and rape offences committed by people
serving a CCO in 2022–23: murder (3 charges), manslaughter
(4 charges) and
rape (6 charges).
