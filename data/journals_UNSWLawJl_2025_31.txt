DISQUALIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
PERPETRATORS FROM THE SUPERANNUATION OF THEIR VICTIMS
RAMI HANEGBI
* AND MIRKO
This article critically examines the distribution of superannuation death
benefits in Australia, focusing on whether perpetrators
of domestic violence
should be disentitled from receiving the superannuation of their victims. The
Australian superannuation system
has complex succession rules that do not always
align with general principles of estate distribution. This article highlights
potential for unfair outcomes, particularly when a domestic abuser benefits
from the superannuation of a deceased partner. We argue
for legislative reform
to prevent such outcomes, suggesting that the law should explicitly disqualify
domestic abusers from receiving
superannuation benefits. This would ensure that
those who inflict harm are not unjustly rewarded. Reforms should disallow the
distribution
of superannuation benefits to perpetrators based on the balance of
probabilities, rather than requiring a criminal conviction, to
address the
challenges inherent in the prosecution of domestic violence cases.
I INTRODUCTION
The distribution of superannuation death benefits in Australia is a critical
aspect of financial planning, often forming a substantial
individual’s estate. However, unlike most other assets, superannuation
entitlements do not automatically become
part of a deceased person’s
estate, and their distribution is governed by a distinct and complex legal
framework. This framework
is a hybrid of trust law and specific legislative
provisions, which can sometimes lead to outcomes that conflict with general
of succession law. Given that superannuation is often a
person’s most significant financial asset after their
the rules governing its
distribution can have profound implications for the financial security of
relatives and beneficiaries, and
it is important that they apply in a coherent
and fair manner.
Recently, this issue arose in the context of a domestic abuser who received
the superannuation of his partner following her
This prompted the former
Shadow Minister for Women, Tanya Plibersek, to flag potential law reform to
prevent such abusers being entitled
to the victim’s
superannuation.
The case sparked
public debate and highlighted potential shortcomings in the current legal
The central question this article addresses is whether the law should
explicitly disqualify domestic abusers from receiving superannuation
from their deceased partners. This issue highlights some key failings associated
with the current law relating to the distribution
of superannuation death
Part II of this article outlines the current legal framework governing
superannuation death benefits, including the rules related
to binding death
benefit nominations (‘BDBNs’) and the discretion exercised by
superannuation trustees in the absence
of a valid BDBN.
Part III highlights the suboptimal outcomes that can arise under the current
law, particularly when trustees must navigate complex
family dynamics or when
domestic violence is a factor. This analysis relates to problems with the law in
general concerning superannuation
death benefits as a backdrop to the main theme
of this article: the manner in which this law does and should apply to the
superannuation
entitlements of domestic violence victims.
Part IV explores the desirability of law reform. It argues that domestic
violence should be grounds for disqualification from receiving
superannuation
benefits, aligning the law with broader societal and legal values such as the
concept of trust and the need to condemn
and deter violence. The discussion
includes a comparison with the operation of normatively grounded principles in
similar legal contexts
such as the forfeiture rule, which prevents individuals
who unlawfully kill another from benefiting from their victim’s
Part V presents specific proposals for reform, suggesting that
disqualification should be based on the balance of probabilities rather
requiring a criminal conviction. This approach acknowledges the challenges in
prosecuting domestic violence cases. Moreover,
the nature and extent of the
disqualification should be commensurate with the nature and duration of the
domestic violence in order
to give effect to the principle of proportionality.
The key reform proposals are summarised in the concluding remarks.
II CURRENT LAW
Most non-superannuation assets are typically distributed in accordance with
the deceased’s intentions as set out in their will,
if they made
If they died intestate, the
law provides rules for distribution of
However, in the case of
superannuation, the relevant law differs substantially. The laws governing
superannuation are at times complex.
As Fryberg J of the Supreme Court of
Queensland remarked: ‘The legislation governing superannuation in
Australia is notoriously
convoluted and is reminiscent of the legendary
oomidoodle bird.’
complexity of the superannuation law affecting the distribution of benefits upon
the member’s death is predominantly due
to the fact that superannuation
funds are managed within a trust structure. However, in essence, the law covers
two situations: where
the deceased had a BDBN, and where they did not.
Generally, a BDBN is the best way to ensure that one’s superannuation
balance is distributed in accordance with one’s

requirements for a valid BDBN.
The regulations applying to most superannuation fund members state that the BDBN
must be signed by the superannuation member as well

For all superannuation funds, the most important factor limiting the validity
of a BDBN is that the named parties must be one of the
dependants or the Legal

to a non-dependant, it will be deemed
The precise legislative definition of ‘dependant’ includes a
spouse (including de facto relationships), children, and
a person with whom one
is in a relationship involving
interdependency.
An ‘interdependency’ relationship is one that involves two persons
and contains the following elements:
• a close personal relationship;
• who live together;
• one or both provides the other with financial support; and
• one or both provides the other with domestic support and personal
The principle of an interdependency relationship can potentially apply to a
variety of relationships which fulfil the above requirements,
including some
situations where children live with their parents to look after

under common
Financial dependency, as
interpreted by the courts, applies beyond situations where someone requires the

another to meet essential day-to-day living
Consequently, due to the constraints imposed by the relevant law discussed
above, if a superannuation account holder wishes to ensure
that someone who is
not a dependant – such as a parent – receives any portion of the
account holder’s superannuation
interest, they must complete a two-step
process. First, they must execute a valid BDBN which names the LPR as being
entitled to the
stated portion of their (the member’s) superannuation
interest. Second, they must name the non-dependant person in their will

This Part explains the key shortcomings of the existing law regarding
superannuation death benefits in a variety of situations. The

intentions are to be followed. The

A Where the Deceased Did Not Have a Valid BDBN
The circumstances in which a deceased did not have a valid BDBN can vary
considerably in terms of the people who may have interest
in the entitlements.
The key variables include the number of competing dependants of the deceased,
their individual needs, and their
relationship to the beneficiary.
In a case widely reported by the media, the deceased, Ashleigh Petrie, a
23-year-old court clerk, was engaged to 68-year-old Magistrate

Such a situation, typified by a party having a strong moral and relational
claim to the superannuation but a weak legal claim due
to not being a
‘dependant’, is one scenario where a lack of BDBN can lead to an
unfair outcome. Another is where multiple
dependants make competing complaints.
Many decisions of the now-defunct Superannuation Complaints Tribunal involved
disputes where
more than one dependant challenged the distribution of the
superannuation death benefit made by the
Particular cases in
which courts have been involved relate to situations where the executor or
administrator of an estate personally
makes a death benefit claim on their own
behalf to the superannuation fund trustee. Here, there is potentially a conflict

estate and can thus be required to request the trustee consider

Courts have come to various decisions in such situations, and in some
circumstances have decided that the executor needs to hold their

claim for the superannuation to the fund trustee,
and was subsequently awarded such an interest, did not have to account for the
interest to the estate.

The law states that

is no obligation to do so.
Legal disputes have arisen where the surviving members of a SMSF, in their
power as trustees, or as directors of a corporate trustee,

exercise their discretion by distributing the deceased’s superannuation

parties who have a potential claim.

absence, case law indicates that the presence of a recalcitrant
trustee can lead
to multi-year delays in the beneficiary acquiring their

result of the application of the current
laws discussed above is that in the

benefit is generally
distributed to a partner, especially in the absence of
other dependants such as children. Also as discussed above, where there is
BDBN, the superannuation benefit will be distributed in accordance with the

the law to indicate that

IV POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND LAW REFORM PROPOSALS
A Rationales Favouring Superannuation
Disqualification
A number of principles support the position that domestic violence
perpetrators should be disqualified from the superannuation of
their partners
who have committed suicide or died in other circumstances after being subjected
to domestic violence. Before discussing
rationales in favour of reform of the
existing law, it is important to note that the change proposed by Plibersek
cannot be justified
by simple analogy with the forfeiture rule. The reason is
that the normative basis for the forfeiture rule does not always sit squarely
with the proposed superannuation disqualification.
The rationale for the forfeiture rule can be traced back more than a century.
Riggs v Palmer
is a seminal
case in American inheritance law that illustrates the interplay between legal
statutes and fundamental moral principles.
The case arose when Elmer Palmer, a
young man aged 16, murdered his grandfather, Francis Palmer, in order to secure
his inheritance
under the terms of his grandfather’s
This act of murder and its
subsequent legal fallout raised critical questions about the limits of legal
formalism and the importance
of moral reasoning in judicial decisions and in the
development of legal
principles.
The central moral and legal norm violated in this case was the principle that
one should not profit from their own wrongdoing –
encapsulated in the
maxim ‘no one should be allowed to benefit from their own wrong’

Elmer’s Case
, Elmer’s actions flagrantly violated this
principle. By murdering his grandfather, Elmer attempted to accelerate his
inheritance
(and prevent the possibility of his grandfather revoking his
inheritance), thereby directly benefiting from his criminal act. The
question before the New York Court of Appeals was whether the will, which
legally entitled Elmer to inherit, should be enforced
despite the circumstances
of Francis Palmer’s
While the literal reading of the law supported Elmer’s claim –
since the will clearly named him as a beneficiary –

However, in such cases – where
there is no direct nexus between the
actions of the perpetrator and the death of the partner – a number of
other normative
and jurisprudential considerations also support the reform
proposed in this article. The first relates to the often-overlooked ideal
loyalty, which legally is underpinned by concept of trust.
1 Loyalty and Breach of Trust
Loyalty is a powerful sentiment. In revisiting philosopher Josiah
Royce’s work, Mathew Foust declared that ‘life has sense
and meaning
only when it is characterized by
Loyalty is,
admittedly, an imprecise concept. It seemingly involves an obligation or
preference which one assumes towards a living
object or a
In terms of its influence
on human behaviour and normative principles, loyalty is a very significant
ideal. The philosopher John
Kleinig has argued that ‘a person who is
completely devoid of loyalties would be deficient as a person understood inter
as a moral agent’.
For some people, loyalty is a powerful motivator or emotional driver in relation
to conduct towards one’s ‘friend, family,
organization, community,
country or species’ and ‘it is likely that loyalties ground more of
the principled, self-sacrificing,
and other kinds of nonselfish behavior in
which people engage’ than other
Thus, loyalty is a deeply ingrained moral principle, often regarded as one of
the most important virtues in personal relationships,
especially in
It holds relationships
together through commitment and mutual trust, allowing individuals to thrive in
partnerships built on care,
respect, and shared goals. More fully, in the
context of marriage or marriage-like relationships, loyalty is an expectation of
support and commitment within a relationship. It binds individuals
together in a shared journey of life, where each person’s
well-being is
tied to the other. Loyalty goes beyond mere legal or contractual obligations; it
is a moral expectation, implicitly
agreed upon by both parties. It is the
foundation upon which trust and emotional intimacy are built, ensuring that even
of adversity, individuals remain committed to each other’s
The normative virtue of loyalty finds legal expression in the concept of
trust, which has been described as
a mechanism that reduces complexity and enables people to cope with the high
levels of uncertainty and complexity of contemporary
life. Trust makes
uncertainty and complexity tolerable because it enables us to focus on only a
few possible alternatives. Humans,
if faced with a full range of alternatives,
if forced to acknowledge and calculate all possible outcomes of all possible
nodes, would freeze in uncertainty and indecision. In this state, we

In our view, the
breach of trust inherent in domestic abuse warrants imposing on perpetrators a
legal penalty in the form of disqualification
from superannuation entitlements.
The existence of a relationship of trust that exists within a domestic
relationship and the need
for condemnation and even punishment that arises if
this trust is violated by domestic violence towards a partner is already
in sentencing law. Thus, in
Shau v The Queen
where a husband
seriously assaulted his pregnant wife, the Victorian Court of Appeal stated:
Compounding, to a significant degree, the seriousness of the offence is the
fact that it occurred within the context of a family relationship.
That fact had

relationship of trust. Lee was five months’

minimum, trust involves an expectation of non-betrayal and mutual support
towards one’s partner. This expectation does not
need to be expressly
conferred; it is an intrinsic part of what it means to be in a relationship.
When domestic violence occurs, it constitutes a fundamental betrayal of
trust. Domestic violence, whether physical, emotional or psychological,
just a violation of a person’s physical and emotional safety but also a
breach of trust. It destroys or damages the
mutual trust and commitment the
relationship was built upon, replacing it with fear, coercion and domination. In
this way, domestic
violence is the ultimate breach of trust, undermining the
very foundation of the relationship. All violence is repugnant. However,
violence perpetrated by a loved one is especially bad because in addition to
physical pain, it necessarily involves a deep betrayal
and corresponding
diminution of security and emotional
well-being,
in circumstances
where the victim has often sacrificed their plans and objectives to accommodate
the projects and preferences of
the abuser.
In the context of superannuation law, the concept of trust provides a
powerful moral argument for disqualifying abusers from receiving
victims’ benefits. The core reason that it is appropriate for a partner to
benefit under their deceased partner’s
superannuation is the emotional
bond they shared and the loyalty that unified their collective during the
relationship. If the living
partner’s behaviour undercuts that ideal
during the relationship, it fundamentally alters the way they should be treated
afterwards,
in the context of the former relationship.
Superannuation is a significant financial asset, often accumulated over the
course of a long-term relationship. It is a form of deferred
financial security,
intended to support individuals and their loved ones after retirement, or in the
event of death.
When a partner observes the concept of trust, they contribute to this shared
future, either directly or indirectly. For example, one
partner may work and
contribute to the superannuation fund while the other supports the household in
non-financial ways, such as
through caregiving or domestic labour. In this
sense, superannuation is not merely an individual asset but a product of joint
reflecting the mutual trust and sacrifices made by both partners.
Domestic violence shatters this joint effort and the emotional ties that bind
the relationship. To allow a domestic abuser to inherit
their victim’s
superannuation is to ignore this fundamental betrayal. It is unjust for someone
who has destroyed the trust
within the relationship, often causing lasting
emotional, psychological and financial harm, to benefit financially from the
relationship
after the victim’s death.
2 Deterrence and the Educative Role of the Law
Several other subsidiary rationales have been advanced in favour of laws
preventing domestic abusers financially benefiting from their
Specifically, it has been suggested that such a reform could act as a
disincentive to domestic

perspective, the deterrence effect of the severity of the punishment is not as
important as the perceived risk
of the punishment
The certainty of
punishment, rather than the severity of the possible sanction, is the most
effective disincentive to inappropriate
Thus, if a clear
legal rule – one which established that domestic abusers were barred from
receiving the superannuation of
their partners – were established and
promulgated, it may reduce the incidence of domestic violence.
Deterrence aside, there are other reasons to support such a law. Firstly, the
law ‘teaches as it
law sends a clear message regarding the moral and societal views of such
behaviour. Moreover, the proposed reform would
play a retributive function by
effectively penalising abusers for their actions.
B Rationales against Superannuation
Disqualification
The strongest argument against our proposal is that the victim while alive
did not expressly take steps to prevent the abuser benefiting
superannuation so the resulting distribution to the abuser should be left
undisturbed, as the deceased’s wishes and
autonomy should be respected.
However, this argument is not compelling.
While one of the primary aims of succession law is to bring about the
deceased’s intent,
rationale is not absolute, either in the context of succession law or in related
fields such as superannuation distributions.
By way of background, one of the
main policies underpinning the forfeiture rules and overseas counterparts
relates to the deceased’s
intentions for distribution of their
That is, if,
hypothetically, while alive, the deceased had known of the perpetrator’s
actions, it is unlikely that they would
intend the perpetrator to benefit
financially.
However, because
domestic violence is often ongoing, this consideration does not necessarily
apply in an identical manner in all
cases. The reality is, as we have seen, that
victims do in some cases have the means to ensure that someone other than the
perpetrator
will be entitled to their superannuation benefits. However, that is
not a compelling policy reason to prevent disentitling abusers
superannuation benefits of their victims. There are two key reasons for this.
First, a victim’s intentions are not the
only, or even cardinal,
consideration in determining appropriate asset division; and second, a
victim’ intentions are often
clouded due to the abuse. We now discuss
these in turn.
1 Appropriate Division of Assets
It is important to note that while respecting the intention of the deceased
is one of the primary goals of succession law, it is not
the only relevant

focus on the deceased’s stated (actual or imputed) intent does not take
into account the fact that the
victim might be unaware of the workings of the
relevant law, or that they might not have turned their mind to the possibility
their death.
2 The Effect of the Abuse Itself
To fully consider the intent of the deceased, it is necessary to take into
account the fact that many abuse victims are in a state
of chronic anxiety and
consequently might not make the same decisions they would make if they were in a
better mental state and had

superannuation.
For a number of reasons including fear, many victims are unable to leave an
abusive relationship,
would be manifestly unfair to allow an abuser to benefit from this unfortunate
reality. People stay in relationships for many
reasons, despite being the
victims of domestic abuse. Such reasons include financial dependency, which in
certain instances is due
to the financial control and abuse of their

the victim’s fear for their personal safety if they instigated a

the abuser’s threatened
retaliation.
This fear can
unfortunately be well-grounded in reality, given that statistically, one of the
most dangerous periods relating to
an abusive domestic relationship is

instances, another disincentive to leaving lies in the prospect of future court

Other factors leading people to stay in abusive relationships include
religious considerations, which are sometimes fortified by religious

men who are the victims,
there is also an additional reluctance to leave due to their perception that

It is important to appreciate that, just as there are several reasons for
victims to stay in such relationships, they might just as
easily believe that
these or other (similarly misguided) reasons justify their partner’s
entitlement to assets such as their
superannuation. In light of this, the wishes
of the domestic violence victims should not, by themselves, be determinative of
distribution of their superannuation assets.
V IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL: CONVICTION NOT NECESSARY,
AND PROPORTIONATE DISENTITLEMENTS
We now discuss the structural parameters regarding implementation of our
proposed reform. First, we should note that internationally,
there is no direct
equivalent to a law disqualifying a non-homicidal abuser from inheriting their
partner’s funds. However,
there is a resembling principle in laws present
in some jurisdictions in the United States (‘US’) that prevents
who commit elder abuse from subsequently inheriting the elder’s
estate. By way of background, in the US, where the equivalent
of the forfeiture
rule is termed the ‘slayer rule’, some states have widened the rule
to include elder abuse.
some cases, elder abuse includes financial abuse, and in other cases it also
includes other types of abuse such as physical
There is also some
variation among states regarding the threshold required for elder abuse to
disqualify an inheritance; some states
require a criminal conviction, and others
set a lower burden of proof that requires only that there be convincing evidence
For instance,
the Californian statute states that an inheritance is disallowed when the
following conditions are fulfilled:
(1) It has been proven by clear and convincing evidence that the person is
liable for physical abuse, neglect, or financial abuse
of the decedent, who was
an elder or dependent adult.
(2) The person is found to have acted in bad faith.
(3) The person has been found to have been reckless, oppressive, fraudulent,
or malicious in the commission of any of these acts upon
the decedent.
(4) The decedent, at the time those acts occurred and thereafter until the
time of his or her death, has been found to have been substantially
manage his or her financial resources or to resist fraud or undue
The wording of this Californian legislation potentially applies to a victim
who is an elder or a ‘dependent adult’. The
relevant legislative
definition of a ‘dependent adult’ is someone between the ages of 18
and 64 who is subject to ‘physical
or mental limitations that restrict his
or her ability to carry out normal activities or to protect his or her
Clearly, such
a definition would cover most victims of domestic violence. Thus, a reform of
the type advanced in this article is
not without precedent internationally
– although, as discussed below, our proposal is to focus the reform on
domestic violence.
A Standard of Proof
One of the key considerations regarding any proposed law to bar abusers from
benefiting from their deceased partner’s superannuation
is the appropriate
standard of evidence. Specifically, should a conviction for domestic violence be
required, or in the alternative,
should the standard be the balance of
probabilities on the available evidence?
By way of background, a conviction is not required under the Australian
forfeiture rule; rather, its application is decided on the
‘balance of
probabilities’.

concerned, although most states do require a conviction,
some only require
convincing evidence of the
From a policy
perspective, there are strong reasons not to require a criminal conviction or a
criminal burden of proof for such a
proposed law. First, the reality is that
victims of abuse often do not report the abuse to
authorities.
This is for a
variety of reasons, including feelings of helplessness and fear of repercussion
from the abuser.
feelings partly reflect the reality that such relationships are cyclical in
nature, which often results in outsiders perceiving
the relationship in a
positive light,

and are able to put on a façade
of charm when the need
The cyclical nature
of abusive relationships is often a strong impediment to a conviction because
the victim will often change their
mind about pressing charges against the
abuser. Domestic violence prosecutions tend to have far lower conviction rates
assault matters – one reason is that victims may decide to not
give evidence, or change their evidence at
Legal coherency is cardinal to determining whether a conviction for an act of
domestic violence is necessary to deny an abuser the
receipt of their former
partner’s superannuation. There is no question that domestic violence is a
criminal act, the scope
of which has been expanded in most Australian
However, the fact
that domestic violence is a crime does not necessarily mean that a conviction is
necessary before legal action
is taken against the perpetrator. In other areas
of the law, criminal behaviour often underpins liability or is the substrate for
an adjustment of legal rights and duties without the need for a conviction or
finding of guilt.
Thus, a range of acts can make a person liable for civil damages underpinned
by criminal behaviour. In torts law, there is no need
for a criminal conviction
for battery, assault or wrongful imprisonment in order for the victim to be
awarded damages.
despite the fact that the elements for these torts are effectively the same as
their criminal law analogues.
In contract law, in order for a party to vitiate a contract on the basis of
illegality (such as theft or fraud), there is no need
to base their claim on a
criminal conviction.
as domestic violence is concerned, one of the few circumstances where an
immigrant can be granted permanent residence in Australia
on the basis of a
partner visa, despite the relationship having terminated, is where the immigrant
left the relationship due to domestic
In order to
establish that domestic violence was the reason for the separation, the law does
not require the visa applicant to demonstrate
that the partner was convicted of
a crime relating to domestic
Accordingly, it would be contrary to established jurisprudence to require a
criminal domestic violence conviction as a precondition
for prevention of an
abusive person’s receipt of their partner’s superannuation. Rather,
such a provision should be subject
to proof on the balance of probabilities.
B Determining the Extent and Type of Domestic Violence
Necessary to Disqualify an Abuser from Receiving Superannuation Benefits
A proposal to disqualify domestic violence perpetrators from receiving the
superannuation benefits of their deceased partners raises
complex questions
The reality is that domestic violence
can vary markedly in nature and degree.
All domestic violence is repugnant. However, there are gradations of severity,
case with all forms of criminal behaviour. Whether a domestic violence
perpetrator should be precluded from receiving entitlements
is not a simple,
binary matter. Instead, domestic violence at the more serious end of the
spectrum should result in a total denial
of superannuation benefits, while less
serious forms should arguably result in a reduction of entitlements. Thus, while
the principle
that domestic abusers should not benefit financially from their
actions is compelling, it is equally important to ensure that any
legal reform
in this area is just, proportionate, and reflective of the nuances inherent in
domestic violence cases.
We now provide guidance on the considerations that should determine when
domestic abuse should negate or reduce the entitlement to
superannuation
benefits. The key considerations, we propose, should be the length of the
relationship, the frequency and severity
of the abuse, and the principle of
proportionality.
1 The Length of the Relationship
The length of the relationship between the abuser and the victim is a crucial
factor in determining the appropriateness of disqualification.
For long-term
relationships, even if the abuse is infrequent, the cumulative effect of
long-term control, manipulation or violence
can be profoundly damaging and
should be taken into account when considering
disqualification.
However, it
is also important to recognise that the duration of a relationship does not
necessarily correlate with the severity of
abuse. In some instances, short-term
relationships may involve intense and severe abuse that justifies
disqualification. Therefore,
while the length of the relationship is a relevant
consideration, it should not be determinative on its own.
Moreover, in some instances the length of the relationship can militate
against a total disqualification of superannuation entitlements.
A long-term
relationship, particularly one spanning several years or decades, typically
provides more opportunities for abusive behaviour
to manifest and escalate but
also greater scope for the demonstration and display of genuine remorse and
emotional reparation. Thus,
for example, an isolated instance of domestic harm
in the context of an otherwise nurturing and supportive relationship which
for over a decade should be less determinative of a superannuation
disqualification than the same event in the context of a short
relationship of
less than 12 months.
2 Frequency of Abuse
The frequency of abusive incidents is another key variable. A pattern of
repeated abuse, even if each individual incident is on the
less serious end of
the spectrum, can create a pervasive atmosphere of fear, control and harm that
justifies disqualification.
Courts should consider whether the abuse was part of an ongoing pattern of
behaviour designed to dominate and control the victim.
This could include
physical violence, emotional abuse, financial control or psychological
manipulation. In making this assessment,
courts should consider the cumulative
severity of less extreme but repeated forms of abuse. For example, a long-term
pattern of verbal
abuse, threats and intimidation that causes the victim to live
in constant fear may be just as, or even more, damaging than a single
of physical violence.
cases, the totality of the abuse should be considered when determining whether
disqualification is appropriate.
3 Severity of Abuse
Severity is arguably the most important factor in determining whether
disqualification is appropriate. Severe abuse, even if it occurs
only once, can
have devastating consequences for the victim and should weigh heavily in favour
of disqualification. The most severe
instances of domestic violence would
typically involve physical violence that causes injury. That said, it is
important to recognise
that the severity of abuse should not be measured solely
by its physical manifestations.
Indeed, another key consideration is the effect of the violence on the
victim’s physical, financial and emotional health. Courts
should consider
whether the abuse caused the victim to lose employment opportunities, suffer
from long-term psychological trauma,
or otherwise experience diminished quality
of life. The greater the impact, the more compelling the case for
disqualification.
4 The Principle of Proportionality
In addition to the specific factors of length, frequency and severity, the
principle of proportionality is also relevant. Proportionality
is a well-known
sentencing principle which stipulates that courts should match the harshness of
the penalty they impose to the gravity
of the crime the defendant
However, it also
has a much wider sphere of legal operation. As noted by Richard G Fox, the
notion of proportionality has a deeply
rooted normative basis which underpins
the wider general system and is ingrained in respect for human rights:
During the late 1970s and 1980s, in reaction to the greater use in the USA of
open-ended ‘rehabilitative’ or ‘preventive’
sentence, academic writings there began to call for return to the classical
notion that punishments had to bear a reasonably
predictable relationship to the
offender’s criminal conduct. It was said that this was not merely good
philosophy, but was
part of our intuitive approach to fairness in the allocation
of praise and blame. The principle seems to embody notions of justice:
People have a sense that punishments scaled to the gravity of offences are
fairer than punishments that are not ... if punishment
is seen as an expression
of blame for reprehensible conduct, then the quantum of punishment should depend
on how reprehensible the
Certainly the idea that a response must be commensurate to the harm caused,
or sought to be prevented, is to be found in many other
areas of the law, both
criminal and civil, such as the defences of provocation and self-defence and
awards of compensatory damages
for personal injury or death. Similarly, in
fashioning equitable remedies, the courts require that the relief awarded be
proportional
to the detriment sought to be avoided. In administrative law,
delegated legislation has been invalidated on the ground of
‘unreasonableness’.
One of the tests of unreasonableness is whether
the regulation is reasonably adapted to achieving the purpose of the enabling
and this itself turns on the ‘reasonable proportionality
test’. ... Proportionality can thus be seen as rooted in respect
basic human rights of those before the
This principle should also be reflected in reforms relating to superannuation
disqualification. From a normative standpoint, the law
should aim to prevent
abusers from profiting from their harmful actions. However, it is also important
to ensure that the response
is commensurate with the gravity of the wrongdoing.
Total disqualification from receiving superannuation benefits is a significant
legal consequence and should be reserved for cases where the abuse is
sufficiently serious to warrant such a penalty.
One approach to ensuring proportionality is to establish a tiered system of
disqualification. For example, in cases of extreme physical
violence or severe
psychological abuse, total disqualification may be appropriate. In cases of less
severe but still harmful behaviour,
courts could have discretion to impose
partial disqualification, reducing the abuser’s entitlement to
superannuation benefits
based on the severity and nature of the abuse.
Courts should also consider the intentions of the deceased, as far as they
can be ascertained. If there is evidence that the victim
intended their abuser
to receive their superannuation benefits – perhaps due to reconciliation
– this should be a factor
in the calculus. However, courts should also
consider whether the victim’s intentions were influenced by the abusive
of the relationship, such as fear or manipulation.
C Summary of Considerations Relevant to the Extent and
Nature of the Disqualification
By way of the summary, we propose that the following factors are central to
determining whether (and to what extent) an abuser should
be disqualified from
receiving superannuation benefits:
1. Length of relationship: Courts should consider the duration of the
relationship, with longer relationships providing more context
for understanding
the nature and impact of the abuse.
2. Frequency of abuse: Courts should assess whether the abuse was a recurring
pattern of behaviour or an isolated incident. Repeated
abuse over time, even if
less severe, may justify disqualification.
3. Severity of abuse: The severity of the abuse should be the primary factor
in determining disqualification. Severe physical, psychological
or emotional
harm, even if occurring only once, should weigh heavily in favour of
disqualification.
4. Proportionality: The legal consequence of disqualification should be
proportionate to the severity and impact of the abuse. Courts
should have
discretion to impose partial or full disqualification based on the circumstances
of the case.
5. Intentions of the deceased: Courts should consider any evidence of the
deceased’s intentions regarding the distribution of
their superannuation
benefits, with a critical eye on whether these intentions were influenced by the
abusive dynamics of the relationship.
6. Impact on the victim’s financial and emotional well-being: The
greater the impact, the more compelling the case for disqualification.
These considerations are intended to provide courts with guidance rather than
a rigid formula. Courts should retain an overarching
discretion to consider the
unique circumstances of each case, as is currently the case for awards of
damages in civil torts cases
and sanctions imposed in criminal
Disqualifying
domestic violence perpetrators from receiving the superannuation benefits of
their victims is a complex issue that
requires careful consideration of multiple
factors. By focusing on the length of the relationship, the frequency and
severity of
the abuse, and broader considerations of justice and
proportionality, courts can make informed decisions that balance the need to
prevent unjust enrichment with the principles of fairness and justice. The above
considerations offer a framework that can guide
trustees, tribunals and courts
making these difficult
ensuring that the
legal system responds appropriately to the realities of domestic violence.
While a rigid formula cannot be determined in advance to govern all
scenarios, illustrative examples can guide this discretion to
consistency and fairness in outcomes. The starting point is that any form of
domestic violence is unacceptable. There

VI CONCLUSION
Distribution of superannuation death benefits in the context of domestic
violence is a complex and morally charged issue that demands
pressing legal
reform. The current legal framework allows for situations where a domestic
abuser can receive the superannuation benefits
of their victim, often leading to
outcomes that are not only unjust but also distressing for the victim’s
surviving family
members. A primary aim of succession law is to honour the
testamentary intentions of the deceased, but in cases involving domestic
violence, this principle must be balanced against the need to prevent
perpetrators from profiting from their harmful actions.
One of the central arguments for reform is the need to align superannuation
law with the broader principles of morality and deterrence.
Allowing a domestic
abuser to inherit the superannuation benefits of their victim not only rewards
reprehensible behaviour but also
sends a troubling message about the acceptance
of domestic violence rather than its blanket repudiation. Such outcomes are
to the virtue of loyalty. Moreover, the retributive aspect of law,
which seeks to punish wrongdoing, is undermined when abusers are
allowed to gain
financially from their actions.
In addition to these considerations, the practical realities of domestic
violence must be acknowledged. Victims of domestic abuse
often remain in harmful
relationships due to fear, financial dependency, and emotional manipulation.
These dynamics can prevent them
from taking steps to protect their
superannuation benefits, such as making BDBNs that exclude their abuser. The law
should recognise
these challenges and provide protections that do not rely
solely on the actions of the victim, who may be too vulnerable or unaware
secure their financial assets effectively.
The proposed legal reform focuses on creating a clear disqualification for
people who, on the balance of probabilities, have been
shown to have engaged in
domestic abuse against their partners. The disqualification may be full or
partial depending on numerous
considerations, including the severity and
frequency of abuse. This balance of probabilities is the appropriate evidential
because it recognises the difficulty of obtaining criminal convictions
in domestic violence cases at the higher standard –
beyond reasonable
doubt – where victims may be unwilling or unable to pursue legal action
against their abuser. The lesser
burden of proof, as used in civil law, would
make the law more accessible and effective in protecting the rights and assets
of victims.
Further, the reform would send a clear societal message, reinforcing the
notion that domestic abuse is a grave moral transgression
that carries
significant consequences, including financial repercussions. It would also
contribute to a broader cultural shift, where
the legal system actively works to
deter domestic abusers and impose adverse consequences on them.
The current legal framework governing superannuation death benefits is
inadequate in addressing the unique and troubling context of
domestic violence.
Legislative reform is necessary to disqualify domestic abusers from receiving
superannuation benefits, ensuring
that the law upholds a person’s right to
live in security and the virtue of loyalty, and protects the financial interests
victims. By adopting a standard based on the balance of probabilities, the
legal system can better address the complexities of domestic
violence, providing
a more just and equitable outcome for all parties involved.

Financial Abuse Report
’). Recommendation 10 of the report
suggested that a beneficiary who has perpetrated abuse or violence against a
superannuation
account holder who commits suicide could be precluded as a
beneficiary of the superannuation funds: at 60. Details of the suggested
were not provided. Another related issue which has been discussed recently is
where a victim-survivor is not eligible for
the abuser’s superannuation
benefits because they were not living together at the time of the abuser’s
death and so were
not considered to be a ‘dependant’ under the
(n 7) provisions: see Daniel Herborn, ‘How the Super System
Fails Domestic and Family Violence Victim-Survivors’,
(online, 24 October 2024) <https://www.choice.com.au/money/financial

advantages of codifying the forfeiture rule is that it could be expanded upon

<https://doi.org/10.2307/2026219>.
Of course, misplaced loyalty
or the fanatical pursuit of loyalty can lead to morally unacceptable outcomes.
Loyalty to an organised
crime gang is undesirable. Loyalty even in the context
of desirable contexts if taken too far can be harmful. The ‘brotherhood
syndrome’, which exists in some police departments can lead to police
members not reporting the illegal behaviour of their
colleagues: Eithne Mills
and Mirko Bagaric, ‘Disloyality and Divorce: Why (and When) the Traitor
Should Pay’
(2004) 18(1)
Australian Journal of Family Law
This does not mean that loyalty and morality are antagonistic. It is merely a
reflection of the fact that no moral norm is absolute.
Thus, it is permissible
to kill in self-defence and lie to prevent a killer finding his victim.

Melbourne University Law Review
In sentencing offenders,
the reasoning methodology is termed the ‘instinctive synthesis’:
Now, ultimately every sentence imposed represents the sentencing judge's
instinctive synthesis of all the various aspects involved
in the punitive
process. Moreover, in our view, it is profitless ... to attempt to allot to the
various considerations their proper
part in the assessment of the particular
punishments presently under examination.
R v Williscroft

[1975] VR 292
, 300 (Adam, Starke and Crockett JJ).
This is not a mechanical process and there is no single correct sentence: at
To be clear, the domestic
abuser disqualification should be triggered in the same manner as other
objections to superannuation payments.
Thus, the claimant, typically a relative
of the victim as defined in
(n 7) s 10, would make the claim to the
trustee of the superannuation fund, and if this were not successful, have
standing to pursue
the matter with the AFCA and then through the court system.
To this end, an analogy
can be made with sentencing law. The maximum penalty for an offence is rarely
imposed. Penalties approaching
the maximum penalty are imposed only for the
worst type of offending of the offence in question:
