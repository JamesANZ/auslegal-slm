COSTS – Costs of manifestly hopeless application for leave to appeal
– No reasons costs should not follow the event –
Respondents
entitled to indemnity costs.
Respondents:
Mr RT Wodak
Respondents:
MST Lawyers
3 October 2025, this Court made orders refusing the applicant leave to appeal
from orders made by O’Meara J in the Trial
Division on 27 March
The Court determined that the
application for leave to appeal was totally without merit within the meaning of
Supreme Court Act 1986
; and orders were made for the
filing and serving of material and submissions in relation to the costs of and
incidental to the application
for leave to appeal.
to those orders:
(a) on 10 October 2025, the respondent filed and served a three-page written
submission, headed ‘Respondents’ Submissions
Regarding Costs’;
(b) on 21 October 2025, the applicant filed a 45-page submission, headed
‘Applicant’s Submissions Regarding Costs’.
Respondents’
submissions
respondents contend that, applying the general rule that costs should follow the
event, the applicant should be ordered to pay
their costs of and incidental to
the application for leave to appeal.
respondents submit that the applicant should be ordered to pay these costs on an
indemnity basis because: first, the application
for leave to appeal was totally
without merit; secondly, in the course of the application, the applicant made
‘serious allegations
that ought never have been made, bringing into being
a proceeding involving groundless contentions’; and thirdly, the applicant
had ‘conducted himself as he has notwithstanding ... [the] careful and
detailed judgment’ given at first instance.
Additionally,
the respondents seek an order that the applicant pay costs which were reserved
by Tsalamandris J in the Trial Division
on 1 May 2025. On that date,
her Honour granted the applicant’s application for an adjournment of
the trial pending him making
an application for leave to appeal to this Court.
Her Honour reserved the costs of the adjournment application and the costs
away by reason of the vacated trial date. The respondent submitted that
these costs ought now be payable by the applicant ‘on
the same basis as is
ordered for the costs of the application for leave to appeal’.
Applicant’s
submissions
the introduction to his submissions regarding costs, the applicant asserts that
this Court and the Registrar have breached the
applicant’s human rights
Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities
(‘the Charter’). The applicant asserts that he needs to
use his submissions regarding costs ‘to draw attention’
human rights have been breached; and that his submissions regarding costs
‘are made in conjunction with [his] 16
October 2025 application for
special leave to the High Court’.
follows the applicant’s introduction are 41 pages of submissions seeking
to show that the decisions adverse to the applicant
made at first instance and
in this Court are wrong. In the course of these submissions, references are made
to a 2004 Productivity
Commission review; international covenants on civil and
political rights and economic, social and cultural rights; and other
principles’, under the headings ‘Cognitive
Bias’ and ‘Logical Fallacies’. While various submissions
made under other headings, it is not necessary to summarise those submissions.
For present purposes, it is sufficient to note
that all of these submissions
contest the matters which have now been determined by this Court adversely to
the applicant; and none
of them relate to the order for costs which should now
be made on the basis that the applicant’s application for leave to appeal
has been refused.
only submissions made by the applicant relevant to the costs order that should
now be made are contained in the conclusion to
the applicant’s
submissions. In that conclusion, the applicant again alleges that ‘serious
errors’ have been made
by the primary judge and this Court, and that, in
those circumstances, this Court ‘should be reluctant to propagate the
injustice arising from the
decision and [the] refused
application to the Court of Appeal’. The applicant then refers to having
been ‘compelled to
undertake expensive legal proceedings’ in the
High Court, before submitting:
In a situation where justice has not [been] seen to be done by the Court of
Appeal, which in part was caused by the conduct of the
respondents in the Court
and the Court of Appeal proceedings, it would be a significant denial of natural
justice to my interests
to consider whether the respondents are entitled to have
their costs (standard or indemnity) awarded against me.
applicant also submits that if costs are to be awarded against him, then those
costs should be stayed pending the determination
of his application for special
the applicant’s submissions conclude:
I believe I have demonstrated with my submissions above that I was entitled to
believe that there was a real prospect of success
with my grounds — and I
would not be in this position if the Court of Appeal had taken reasonable steps
to protect my rights
of the Charter in these proceedings.
Consideration
applicant was wholly unsuccessful in his application for leave to appeal.
Ordinarily, costs follow the event. There is no reason
why costs should not
follow the event in this case. The fact that the applicant might disagree (even
vehemently) with the decision
refusing his application for leave to appeal is no
basis for this Court to depart from the usual course that costs follow the
advised, the applicant should have known that his application for leave to
appeal to this Court had no prospects of success.
That being the case, his
application for leave to appeal must be presumed to have been commenced and
continued ‘for some ulterior
motive, or because of some wilful disregard
of the known facts or the clearly established
the commencement or continuance of proceedings ‘in wilful disregard of
known facts or clearly established law’ is
a basis for awarding indemnity
as French J said in
J-Corp Pty Ltd v Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (No
It is not a necessary condition of the power to award such costs that a
collateral purpose or some species of fraud be established.
It is sufficient, in
my opinion, to enliven the discretion to award such costs that, for whatever
reason, a party persists in what
should on proper consideration be seen to be a
hopeless case.
application for leave to appeal in this case was manifestly hopeless. While I
accept that the applicant believes in the strength
of his cause, on any proper
consideration of his application for leave to appeal, it should have been seen
as devoid of merit. While
I have taken into account what was said by this Court
Macedon Ranges Shire Council v
and the authorities
referred to in that decision, I have, nevertheless, come to the view that the
respondents should have their costs
of and incidental to the application for
leave to appeal on the indemnity basis. The application made to the primary
judge was meritless,
application for leave to appeal to this Court.
said, I do not propose to make any order in relation to the costs reserved by
Tsalamandris J on 1 May 2025. Those costs were
not reserved to this Court.
They were reserved in the Trial Division and should remain reserved to a judge
of that division seized
of the primary
(most likely the judge
who makes final orders disposing of the proceeding in the Trial Division).
the applicant has not established any basis upon which any order for costs made
against him by this Court should be stayed.
While it is highly unlikely that he
would be required to pay any costs ordered by this Court prior to the resolution
of his special
leave application (because those costs will not likely be
quantified prior to the determination of the special leave application),
in the applicant’s material justifies the staying of any costs order made
against him in this Court. As a first condition
for a stay of any costs order
pending the determination of a special leave application, there must be a
‘substantial prospect
that special leave to appeal will be
pre‑empting the view that may be expressed by the High
I am not persuaded that
there is any real prospect (let alone a ‘substantial prospect’) that
special leave to appeal
will be granted in this case.
will be an order that the applicant pay the respondents’ costs of and
incidental to the application for leave to appeal,
such costs to be taxed, in
default of agreement, on the indemnity basis.
