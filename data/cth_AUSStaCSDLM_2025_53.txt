Exemptions from disallowance
and sunsetting
6.1 This Chapter lists the instruments which the committee has resolved to
draw to the attention of the Senate under standing order
23(4) because they are
exempt from disallowance and sunsetting and do not satisfy the committee's
expectations in relation to the
source and appropriateness of the exemptions
following the committee's scrutiny under standing orders 23(4A) and
Exemptions from
disallowance
16 June 2021, the Senate resolved that delegated legislation should be subject
to disallowance to permit appropriate parliamentary
scrutiny and oversight
unless there are exceptional circumstances and any claim that circumstances
justify exemption from disallowance
will be subjected to rigorous scrutiny with
the expectation that the claim will only be justified in rare
6.3 Senate standing order 23(4A) provides that the committee may consider
instruments that are not subject to disallowance, including
whether it is
appropriate for these instruments to be exempt from disallowance. Noting the
Senate's concern about the exemption of
delegated legislation from disallowance,
this section identifies the instruments which do not satisfy the committee's
expectations
regarding the circumstances of their exemption from
disallowance.
6.4 Subject to exceptional circumstances, the committee's expectations will
not be met where the instrument:
• is exempt
from disallowance under one of the broad classes of exemptions in
Legislation (Exemptions and Other Matters) Regulation
• is exempt from disallowance under the blanket exemption for
instruments facilitating the establishment or operation of an
intergovernmental
body or scheme in
section 44(1)
Legislation Act
• overrides or modifies primary legislation;
• triggers, or is a precondition to, the imposition of custodial
penalties or significant pecuniary penalties;
• restricts personal rights and liberties;
• facilitates the expenditure of public money, including Advance to the
Finance Minister determinations; or
• otherwise contains a matter requiring parliamentary oversight.
6.5 To assess whether an instrument is appropriately exempt from
disallowance, the committee expects that at a minimum, the explanatory
will contain a statement that provides the source and the exceptional
circumstances that justify the exemption from disallowance.
6.6 Further information about the committee's expectations regarding the
exemption of delegated legislation from disallowance are
contained in the
committee's guidelines and the reports of its inquiry into the exemption of
delegated legislation from parliamentary
Instruments which do not meet the committee's

Exemptions from
6.8 Senate standing order 23(3)(k) requires the committee to scrutinise
instruments which are exempt from the sunsetting provisions
Legislation Act 2003
(the Legislation Act), including whether it is
appropriate for these instruments to be exempt from sunsetting
6.9 The sunsetting framework established under section 50 of the Legislation
Act provides that all legislative instruments registered
on the Federal Register
of Legislation after 1 January 2005 are automatically repealed ten years after
registration. Sunsetting provides
the opportunity for Parliament (as well as
ministers and agencies) to ensure that the content of delegated legislation
remains appropriate,
and for Parliament to maintain effective, regular oversight
of delegated powers.
6.10 On 16 June 2021, the Senate resolved that delegated legislation should
be subject to sunsetting to permit appropriate parliamentary
scrutiny and
oversight unless there are exceptional circumstances and any claim that
circumstances justify exemption from sunsetting
will be subjected to rigorous
scrutiny with the expectation that the claim will only be justified in rare
6.11 Where an instrument is exempt from sunsetting, Senate standing order
23(3)(k) requires the committee to scrutinise each instrument
as to whether the
exemption is appropriate. Noting the Senate's concern about the exemption of
delegated legislation from sunsetting,
this section identifies instruments which
do not satisfy the committee's expectations regarding the appropriateness of
their exemption
from sunsetting.
6.12 Subject to exceptional circumstances, the committee's expectations will
not be met where the instrument:
• is exempt from sunsetting under one of
the broad classes of exemptions in
Legislation (Exemptions and
Other Matters) Regulation 2015
• is exempt from sunsetting under the blanket exemption of instruments
facilitating the establishment or operation of an intergovernmental
section 54(1)
Legislation Act
• overrides or modifies primary legislation;
• triggers, or is a precondition to, the imposition of custodial
penalties or significant pecuniary penalties;
• restricts personal rights and liberties;
• facilitates the expenditure of public money on an ongoing basis;
• otherwise contains a matter requiring parliamentary oversight.
6.13 To assess whether an instrument is appropriately exempt from sunsetting,
the committee expects that at a minimum, the explanatory
statement will contain
a statement that provides the source and the exceptional circumstances that
justify the exemption from sunsetting.
6.14 Further information about the committee's expectations about the
exemption of delegated legislation from sunsetting are contained
committee's guidelines and the reports of its inquiry into the exemption of
delegated legislation from parliamentary
