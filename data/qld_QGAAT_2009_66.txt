REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE
APPLICATION
[1] Previous Orders had been made concerning RAA - in 2006 the Adult Guardian
was appointed for accommodation and healthcare for
1 year with The Public
Trustee of Queensland indefinitely appointed for all financial matters. On 31
August 2007, the Adult Guardian
and the Public Trustee were again appointed as
Guardian and Administrator and on 17 September 2008, RAA’s mother, KV, was
in both roles. On 14 July 2009, the Adult Guardian and the Public
Trustee were again appointed for three months.
[2] This hearing of the Tribunal was initiated at the request of the Senior
Counsellor of a youth organisation to review the appointments
made in July 2009,
with the Tribunal also initiating a review of these appointments.
The Issues and the Legislation
[3] The issues for the Tribunal are:
(a) Does RAA have capacity
for the matter?
(b) Is there a need for a Guardian? If so, who should be appointed? and
(c) Is there a need for an Administrator? If so, who should be appointed?
Guardianship and Administration Act
deals with appointments which can be made.
(1) The tribunal may, by order, appoint a guardian for a
personal matter, or an administrator for a financial matter, for an adult
tribunal is satisfied--
(a) the adult has impaired capacity for the matter; and
(b) there is a need for a decision in relation to the matter or the adult
is likely to do something in relation to the matter that
involves, or is likely
to involve, unreasonable risk to the adult's health, welfare or property; and
(c) without an appointment--
(i) the adult's needs will not be adequately met; or
(ii) the adult's interests will not be adequately protected.
(2) The appointment may be on terms considered appropriate by the
(3) The tribunal may make the order on its own initiative or on the
application of the adult, the adult guardian or an interested
(4) ........
[5] Capacity is defined in Schedule 4 of the Act
, for a person for a
matter, means the person is capable of-
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
[6] The review of the appointment of a guardian and an administrator is made
pursuant to
of the Act which provides as follows:
31 Appointment review process
The tribunal may conduct a review of an appointment of a
guardian or administrator (an
”) for an adult in
the way it considers appropriate.
At the end of the review, the tribunal must revoke its
order making the appointment unless it is satisfied it would make an appointment
if a new application for an appointment were to be made.
If the tribunal is satisfied there are appropriate
grounds for an appointment to continue, it may either—
(a) continue its order making the appointment; or
(b) change its order making the appointment, including, for
(i) changing the terms of the appointment; or
(ii) removing an appointee; or
(iii) making a new appointment.
However, the tribunal may make an order removing an
appointee only if the tribunal considers—
(a) the appointee is no longer competent; or
(b) another person is more appropriate for appointment.
An appointee is no longer competent if, for
(a) a relevant interest of the adult has not been, or is not being,
adequately protected; or
(b) the appointee has neglected the appointee’s duties or abused the
appointee’s powers, whether generally or in relation
to a specific
(c) the appointee is an administrator appointed for a matter involving an
interest in land and the appointee fails to advise the registrar
of titles of
the appointment as required under
section 21(1)
(d) the appointee has otherwise contravened this Act.
The tribunal may include in its order changing or
revoking the appointment of an administrator a provision as to who must pay the
fee payable to the registrar of titles for advice of the change or
revocation.
THE PARTIES
[7] The following persons attended the hearing:
RAA – the adult (for about one hour)
KV – adult’s mother
RT – sister
FJ – service provider FNQILSA
ML - support facilitator Department of Communities
SL – supervisor Department of Communities
SG – youth organisation
DJ – representative of the Office of Adult Guardian.
SC – representative of The Public Trustee of Queensland.
THE EVIDENCE
[8] In addition to the written material contained on the Tribunal file, all of
the parties attending the hearing were given the opportunity
to express their
views. These views, where specifically relied upon by the Tribunal, are
discussed below.
[9] RAA’s mother provided expansive materials including photographs taken
during his recent time interstate, his history and
recent events and care
particularly with accommodation and services decisions which she considered did
not meet his needs.
DOES RAA LACK CAPACITY FOR THE MATTER?
[10] Ms KT, a psychologist, reported on 24 February 2009, that RAA has Russel
Silver Syndrome, paranoid schizophrenia, a spinal fusion,
skin abscesses, nasal
polyps and dental problems. The psychologist noted that RAA is unable to make
complex decisions and takes Respirodal
and Valium for his medical conditions.
This health professional report is consistent with those provided for previous
hearings, that
RAA has the dual diagnosis of mild intellectual deficits with
physical health issues and an IQ test score of 66.
[11] FJ informed the Tribunal that RAA has growth deficits, abnormal sexual
development and learning disabilities which leave his
external appearance
different to others of his age. The adult’s mother commented that the
Syndrome is progressive and that
it appears to be speeding up in recent times.
[12] RAA’s severe behavioural issues were exemplified with it being
reported that he had been arrested the previous evening
for harassing school
children. During the hearing RAA’s behaviour was disruptive until he left
the hearing.
[13] All parties present at the hearing agreed that RAA lacks capacity to make
decisions and his mother noted that RAA is unable
to function without
significant support.
[14] In respect of money issues, the Public Trustee reported that RAA makes
purchases on the internet, may have outstanding SPER
debts and has a keycard. FJ
reported gambling problems which had led to the keycard being held by his
support worker. His mother
commented that RAA will do anything to get money
including prostitution – this causes her extreme distress and she always
money if he requests or requires it.
[15] Oral and written evidence stated that it is part of RAA’s condition
that he will turn against anyone who works with him
and prefers to be somewhere
else, as shown by his movements from north Queensland to stay with his mother
and sister interstate and
subsequent return to north Queesland and recent
decisions and actions to travel to other places. It was agreed that RAA is never
happy with arrangements made for him and that this is part of the progress of
his illness.
[16] The Tribunal concluded from the written evidence, oral evidence from
attending parties and RAA’s behaviour at the hearing,
that he lacks
capacity and requires the assistance of a substitute decision-maker for personal
and financial decisions.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN?
[17] The Office of the Adult Guardian reported on RAA’s complex needs
including his previous homelessness, health and mental
health problems. Several
decisions had been made by them concerning emergency and short-term
accommodation and their having recently
secured accommodation through the
Queensland Housing Department.
[18] Support services are being provided through FNQILSA with behavioural issues
requiring several stays at the Mental Health Unit
of the hospital. RAA has had
issues with the Police, including being in custody that morning. Comments were
made by support workers
that they were currently very concerned for RAA’s
safety because of the International Conference being held in north Queensland
with increased police presence because of the attendance of the Prime Minister
and several Heads of State from other countries and
they feared he might
precipitate action of the armed response officers by his behaviour.
[19] KV stated that RAA requires permanent placement in mental health services
accommodation such as the Park Hospital so that he
can received medium to long
term treatment.
[20] Support staff supported the opinion of the Adult Guardian that RAA requires
the appointment of a Guardian and that he has extensive
needs in relation to all
issues but particularly accommodation and health services both mental and in
response to his physical ailments.
[21] The adult has dual disabilities and tendency to tell lies, which makes him
highly vulnerable particularly because of his behaviour
of being manipulative in
relation to those close to him which creates a tendency for people not to
believe him. This situation recently
resulted in his being rushed to hospital to
have his appendix removed.
[22] The youth organisation’s representative said that they had provided
services to RAA for six years and more recently since
his return to north
Queensland from staying with his mother and sister interstate. The youth
organisation representative stated that
RAA’s needs are becoming more
complex with time and he requires significant decision-making on his behalf and
this is more
easily obtained from the Office of Adult Guardian than from his
mother. Department of Communities stated that RAA’s mother’s
insistence that he be accommodated in the city, which he would prefer, placed
him in danger of a further instance of homelessness
when accommodation was
available outside the city centre and her refusal of support services.
[23] The adult has multiple complex needs which are becoming more difficult and
serious as his illnesses progress. He has complex
needs in relation to
accommodation and service support as well as his health issues and in relation
to the police. The adult has
significant health issues which have worsened in
the last month. The adult is at risk of homelessness and precipitating
significant
conflict with the police or member of the community.
[24] The Tribunal concluded on the evidence presented that there is need for the
appointment of a guardian and would have made this
appointment if the matter was
before the Tribunal for the first time.
IF SO WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED?
[25] The options for appointment were the Adult Guardian and his mother –
both who have held appointments previously. During
the hearing RAA stated that
he preferred that his mother be appointed, his sister was also of the opinion
that KV was the preferred
[26] KV was of the opinion that distance (between north Queensland and
interstate) did not mean that she is not able to assist and
emergencies. A real estate agent with whom KV had been dealing in respect of
RAA’s accommodation needs supported
her being his guardian as she had his
long-term welfare at heart. RAA’s family’s involvement and
continuing care was
evident from the written materials available and oral
evidence presented to the hearing.
[27] The evidence showed that KV has been unable to work with service providers
although none doubted her concern and willingness
to be of assistance to RAA.
Service providers stated that KV being interstate creates difficulties
particularly in relation to his
accommodation needs.
[28] The Tribunal concluded that there is a need for an independent
decision-maker to actively engage with stakeholders, including
his mother and
sister, mental health services in north Queensland and beyond, service
providers, agencies and police.
[29] The Tribunal considered the evidence both written and oral and the review
requirements of
of the Act and concluded that the preferred
appointment was to the Adult Guardian for a period of 3 years for all personal
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATOR?
[30] KV stated that with RAA one is not dealing with a person with the
capacities of an adult, but someone with the capacities of
a 10 year old boy.
She stated that RAA receives money three times a week and that if he requires
more she provides it. KV’s
expressed her grave concern about RAA’s
reaction to lack of money by prostituting himself on the streets and that she
sent money to satisfy him. KV said this was because a ‘bribed child
was a controllable child’. Professional workers were
concerned at this
statement which was also continued in the documents received from KV, as
satisfying his needs in this way is not
[31] The service providers said that a stakeholder meeting had been held
recently and all parties agreed that the adult needs an
administrator appointed
to assist him with the management of financial matters. All parties at the
hearing agreed that RAA requires
assistance with financial matters.
[32] RAA receives a Disability Services pension and needs money to meet his
accommodation, living expenses and for food and cigarettes.
He recently obtained
an advance from Centrelink for $500 which was quickly dissipated. His most
recent arrest was precipitated by
his harassing students for money and
cigarettes. The applicant was also concerned about RAA’s vulnerability and
gambling issues.
His ready access to money means that his behaviour places him
at risk and has not improved his ability to manage money or his attitude
it. KV doubted that RAA is able to learn such skills as previous attempts had
[33] From the evidence provided the Tribunal concluded that RAA is highly
vulnerable and his lack of financial management skills
and impetuousness make
him highly at risk of significant personal harm and issues such as homelessness.
The Tribunal concluded that
there is a need to appoint an administrator.
IF SO WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED?
[34] The options for appointment are the adult’s mother or the Public
[35] KV stated that RAA has been under control of the Public Trustee from 2006
– 2008 and they did not properly look after
him. She said that RAA cannot
‘learn the rules’ because of his mental disorder and that no matter
what structure is imposed
he cannot learn and he does what he wants.
[36] RAA told the hearing that he preferred to manage his money himself, or if
not, his mother.
[37] RAA’s guardian spoke of three stakeholder meetings having been held
and that his not learning that money needs to be budgeted
as he gets money at
the flick of his finger and that his behavioural issues are of great concern.
[38] Service workers stated that it is easy for agencies to work with the Public
Trustee and that although his mother wishes to assist,
her provision of money is
not assisting RAA. The service and agency workers at the hearing stated that
they considered the Public
Trustee the preferred appointment.
[39] KV told the Tribunal that it had been planned for RAA to visit his
grandparents in Serbia but this had not been possible because
of death and ill
health, however it is her intention to relocate to Europe in the near future
with RAA and that he would be better
[40] RAA has complex needs. His intellectual, mental
health and behavioural issues place him at acute risk. RAA’s mother and
sister have very different ideas concerning his care from that of professional
service providers.
[41] The Tribunal in carefully considering all the written and oral evidence and
the review requirements of
of the Act, concluded that although KV
definitely had RAA’s best interests at heart, the Public Trustee was the
preferred appointee
as they are better able to coordinate with stakeholders and
service providers in north Queensland to address RAA’s needs.
