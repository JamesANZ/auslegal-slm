STATEMENT OF DECISION AND REASONS
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
is an application for review of a decision made by a delegate of the Minister
for Immigration on 5 September 2014 to refuse to
grant the visa applicant
Extended Eligibility (Temporary) (Class TK) visas under
visa applicant applied for the visas on 25 March 2014. The delegate refused to
grant the visa because the applicant did not satisfy
cl.445.225 and cl.445.226
of Schedule 2 to the
Migration Regulations 1994
(the Regulations).
applicants were represented in relation to the review by their registered
migration agent.
reaching its decision the Tribunal did not consider a hearing to be necessary,
as it was able to find in favour of the visa applicant
on the basis of the
material before it, pursuant to section 360(2)(a) of the Act.
the following reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the matter should be
remitted for reconsideration.
CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE
issue in the present case is whether the visa applicant meets cl.445.225 and
the delegate’s decision – a copy of which was provided to the
Tribunal as part of this review – the delegate
stated that the Department
wrote to the applicant on 19 May 2014 and 6 August 2014 requesting further
information and no response
was received. The information requested was:
translation of the applicant’s birth certificate;
translation of the applicant’s parents’ divorce certificate;
migrate from the applicant’s father;
examination from the applicant; and
National police
certificate from the sponsor.
delegate stated that in “
the absence of the requested
information
” she could not be satisfied that the applicant met the
criteria outlined in cl.445.225 and cl.445.226. The delegate did not
which public interest criteria (PIC) the visa applicant had failed to meet.
requires that the visa applicant meets PIC 4001, 4002, 4003, 4004, 4007, 4009,
4020 and 4021. Clause 445.226 requires that,
if the visa applicant has not
turned 18, he or she meets PIC 4017 and PIC 4018.
requested medical examination from the applicant is relevant to meeting the
requirements of PIC 4007. The applicant’s birth
certificate is relevant to
determining if the applicant must also meet PIC 4019 because he has turned 18.
The applicant’s parents’
divorce certificate and the consent to
migrate from the applicant’s father are relevant to meeting the
requirements of cl.445.226.
sponsor’s national police certificate is not relevant to either cl.445.225
or cl.445.226.
requested information was not relevant to determining whether or not the
applicant met the requirements of PIC 4001, 4002, 4003,
4004 and 4020. PIC 4001,
4002, 4003 and 4004 relate to the applicant’s character, whether the
applicant poses a risk to security,
whether his presence in Australia would be
contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests and whether the applicant
debt to the Commonwealth. Likewise PIC 4020 requires that there is no
evidence that the applicant has given or caused to be given
false or misleading
documents/information in relation to the visa application or relevant previous
visa applications. There is insufficient
evidence before the Tribunal to
determine those matters and the Tribunal is of the view that the most
appropriate course of action
is for those determinations to be made by the
Department. However there is sufficient information before the Tribunal to
PIC 4007, PIC 4009 and PIC 4021.
review applicant provided the Tribunal with certified copies of:
applicant’s natural parents’ translated marriage certificate -
stating that Ms Ngonthong and Mr Andrew Jay Canfield
were married on 20 June
applicant natural parents’ translated divorce certificate - stating that
Ms Ngonthong and Mr Andrew Jay Canfield were
divorced on 7 May 2005;
Certified copy
of the visa applicant’s translated birth certificate;
Consent to grant
an Australian visa to a child under the age of 18 years (Form 1229) dated 4
November 2014 signed by the visa applicant’s
natural mother and father, Ms
Ngonthong and Mr Andrew Jay Canfield (respectively). The form indicates that
consent is for travel
to Australia for a temporary visit;
Copy of the bio
page of Mr Andrew Jay Canfield’s passport;
Another Consent
to grant an Australian visa to a child under the age of 18 years (Form 1229)
dated 13 November 2014 signed by the
visa applicant’s natural father Mr
Andrew Jay Canfield indicating that consent is for travel to Australia for both
a temporary
visit and permanent residence;
consent dated 3 December 2013 and a translated letter of agreement dated 15
September 2014 stating that the visa applicant’s
natural mother and father
(Ms Ngonthong and Mr Andrew Jay Canfield) give consent for the visa applicant to
travel abroad;
certificate of authority dated 14 September 2014 stating that the visa
applicant’s natural father (Mr Andrew Jay
Canfield) consents to
authority and foster
” of the visa applicant to his natural
mother unilaterally. The certificate included each parent’s address and
Identification
Card number;
Copies of the
emails between the visa applicant’s natural father, the visa
applicant’s step-father and the review applicant’s
representative.
Those emails discussed the visa applicant’s natural father’s
difficulties in providing the required documentation
due to language and
location barriers.
on a copy of the visa applicant’s birth certificate, the Tribunal finds
that the visa applicant (Mr Jakkrit Canfield)
was born on 23 April 2003 and that
his parents are Ms Boonmee Ngonthong and Andrew Canfield. This means that the
visa applicant was
under 18 at the time of the visa application and at the time
of decision. The Tribunal finds that the visa applicant is under 18
and a child
of Ms Ngonthong. He therefore satisfies the definition of a dependent child
under r.1.03.
on the department’s records, the Tribunal finds that Ms Ngonthong was
granted a subclass 309 visa on 7 November 2013 and
is at the date of decision
still the holder of a subclass 309 visa. This means that at the time of the
visa application and time
of decision Ms Ngonthong is a “visa holding
4007 is satisfied if the applicant meets certain health requirements. On 19 May
2014, the applicant was requested to complete
a medical examination through the
Department's panel doctors. In the request letter the applicant was given 28
calendar days from
the date he was deemed to have received the letter, to
provide the completed medical examination. A further document request letter
sent on 6 August 2014, advising that the applicant had a further 28 days to
provide the requested medical examination. This letter
stated that if the
applicant did not reply within the specified timeframe a decision would be made
on the application without the
requested information being taken into account.
On 5 September 2014, the applicant had not provided evidence of a complete
examination.
electronic records before the Tribunal indicate that the visa applicant has
undertaken a chest X-ray examination and a medical
examination and that the
outcome of “
no significant findings
” was recorded.
Tribunal is bound to accept the assessment of the Medical Officer of the
Commonwealth to be correct for the purposes of deciding
whether the visa
applicant satisfies the health criterion. Accordingly, based on the opinion of
the Medical Officer of the Commonwealth,
the Tribunal finds that the visa
applicant satisfies PIC 4007 for the purposes of cl.445.225.
4009 is satisfied if the visa applicant intends to live permanently in Australia
and could obtain support in Australia from other
members of the family unit.
evidence before the Tribunal is that the visa applicant is the son of Ms
Ngonthong. Ms Ngonthong was granted a Subclass 309 visa
on 7 November 2013 and
has lived in Australia with her Australian spouse since that time. Her intention
was to become settled in
Australia before making arrangements for the visa
applicant to join her. However the visa applicant’s carer in Thailand (his
grandmother) died.
the Department’s file there is a letter from the sponsor stating that he
will provide for the visa applicant and his mother.
Based on the information
before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the visa applicant intends to live
permanently in Australia and
could obtain support in Australia from other
members of the family unit. The Tribunal finds that the visa applicant meets the
requirements
of PIC 4009 for the purposes of cl.445.225.
4021 requires the visa applicant to hold a valid passport unless it would be
unreasonable to require the visa applicant to hold
a passport. The review
applicant provided to the Tribunal a certified copy of the photograph page of
the visa applicant’s passport.
The document notes that it is a passport
issued by the United States of America and was issued on 10 May 2013 and is due
on 9 May 2018. The Tribunal finds based on the evidence available that
the visa applicant holds a valid passport that was issued
to the visa applicant
by an official source and in the form issued by the official source. Further the
Tribunal had regard to the
relevant instrument IMMI 13/032 and the Tribunal
finds that the passport is not in a class of passports specified by the Minister
for the purposes of PIC 4021(a)(iii). The Tribunal finds that the visa applicant
meets the requirements of PIC 4021 for the purposes
cl.445.225.
445.226 requires that, if the visa applicant has not turned
18, PIC 4017
4018 are satisfied in relation to the visa applicant.
order for the visa applicant to meet PIC 4017 the Minister must be satisfied
that either the laws of Thailand permit the removal
of the visa applicant, or
each person who can lawfully determine where the visa applicant is to live
consents to the grant of the
visa, or the grant of the visa would be consistent
with any Australian child order in force in relation to the visa applicant.
noted above the question in this case concerns whether PIC 4017 is satisfied. In
particular PIC 4017(b) provides: that “
each person who can lawfully
determine where the applicant is to live consents to the grant of the
”. Before the Tribunal is a Certificate of authority, a Form 1229
signed by Mr Canfield indicating that consent is for travel
to Australia for
both a temporary visit and permanent residence and emails between Mr Canfield,
the migration agent and the review
applicant indicating his willingness to
provide the required documentation related to prove his consent. The Tribunal
accepts the
documents at face value. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that
PIC 4017(b) is met, that is, the Tribunal is satisfied that each
person who can
lawfully determine where the visa applicant is to live consents to the grant of
the visa. As the Tribunal needs to
be satisfied that at least one of the three
alternatives (a), (b), or (c) is met in PIC 4017, and the Tribunal is satisfied
PIC 4017(b) is met, therefore the Tribunal is satisfied that the visa
applicant meets the requirements of PIC 4017.
4018 is satisfied if the Minister is satisfied that there is no compelling
reason to believe that the grant of the visa would
not be in the best interests
of the visa applicant. In this case the Tribunal is satisfied that there are no
compelling reasons
why it would not be in the visa applicant’s best
interests to be granted the visa. Therefore PIC 4018 is satisfied.
follows then that cl.445.226 is satisfied.
the findings above, the appropriate course is to remit the application for the
visa to the Minister to consider the remaining
criteria for the
Tribunal remits the application for Extended Eligibility (Temporary) (Class TK)
visas for reconsideration, with the direction
that the visa applicant meets the
following criteria for a Subclass 445 (Dependent Child) visa:
PIC 4007, PIC
4009 and PIC 4021 for the purposes of cl.445.225 of Schedule 2 to the
Regulations;
Cl.445.226 of
Schedule 2 to the Regulations.
