J Weller, Solicitor
1. The Court is being asked to determine whether the
applicant before the Court is a person who is an eligible person within the
Drug Court Act 1998
provides this definition of an"eligible person":
(1) A person is an eligible person if:
(a) the person is charged with an offence, other than an offence referred to in
subsection (2), and
(b) the facts alleged in connection with the offence, together with the person's
antecedents and any other information available
to the court, indicate that it
is highly likely that the person will, if convicted, be required to serve a
sentence of full-time
imprisonment, and
(c) the person has pleaded guilty to, or indicated that he or she intends to
plead guilty to, the offence, and
(d) the person appears to be dependent on the use of prohibited drugs (within
the meaning of the
Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985
) or other drugs
prescribed by the regulations, and
(e) the person satisfies such other criteria as are prescribed by the
regulations.
(2) A person is not an eligible person if the person is charged
(a) an offence punishable under Division 2 of
Drug Misuse and
Trafficking Act 1985
, not being an offence that (under Division 3 of
Criminal Procedure Act 1986
) is capable of being dealt with
summarily, or
(b) an offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault, or
(c) any other offence of a kind prescribed by the regulations.
3. The applicant has indicated that it is his
intention to plead guilty to the four offences before the Court, which are
against s.322 or 326 or the
Crimes Act 1900
Section 322
provides that:
“A person who threatens to do or cause, or who does or causes, any injury
or detriment to any person:
(a) intending to influence a person called or to be called as a witness in any
judicial proceeding to give false evidence or withhold
true evidence or to not
attend as a witness or not produce anything in evidence pursuant to a summons or
subpoena, or
(b) intending to influence any person (whether or not a particular person) in
the person's conduct as a juror in any judicial proceeding
or to not attend as a
juror in any judicial proceeding, whether he or she has been sworn as a juror or
(c) intending to influence any person in the person's conduct as a judicial
officer, or
(d) intending to influence any person in the person's conduct as a public
justice official in or in connection with any judicial
proceeding,
to imprisonment for 10 years. “
Section 326
creates a similar offence for action against a “public justice
5. The question of being a drug dependent person has not
yet been canvassed in argument, but I am informed it remains in issue. The
principle issue which the Crown raises is that the offences are offences
involving violent conduct.
6. The allegations to which the applicant
intends to plead guilty relate to stealing and dealing with motor vehicles in
what is commonly
known as a “re-birthing” operation, matters for
which at the time of the alleged offences he was on bail or in custody.
the witnesses who was to give evidence was a person called Adrian Gatt. It is
alleged that on 9 March this year the applicant
rang the doorbell of the
witness’s mother’s home. He asked for the witness. He was told that
Mr. Gatt was not home and
the applicant was also told that he was not welcome
there. I am told the applicant intends to plead guilty to saying “Tell
that if he shows up in Court on Friday I will kill him.” Mrs Gatt then
reacted in fear, rang her son who in turn notified
the Police.
March, after having been arrested for that offence, the applicant was in custody
at Silverwater. Another witness in those
same cases was apparently also in
custody and walked past the applicant in his cell. The applicant then made a
number of threats,
that included these words, “It doesn’t matter
where you go I am gunna get you, I’m gunna pay officers to get you.”
8. Relating to the second two charges under
the allegations were
that the applicant was heard to say “I want that fat copper and the short
blond one, I want to get them.”
This apparently was a reference to two
police officers who had been involved in the investigation of the
9. The question I have to decide is whether those offences by
nature, or by the elements or ingredients of the charges, are offences
involve violent conduct within the meaning of
Drug Court Act
. This question has been a vexed question in the Drug Court and has been the
subject of some ruling in superior Courts and here.
10. The question has
been discussed most recently in DPP v Ebsworth [2001]NSWCA 318 (7 September
2001), wherein reference was made
to Chandler v DPP
[2000] NSWCA 125
(2000) 113 A Crim R 196
v Ranse [1999]NSWDRC 2, DPP v. Sloane [1999]NSWDRC 3 and DPP v Armanios
[1999]NSWDRC 5. The cases involving Ebsworth, Sloane
and Armanios were matters
relating to offences of robbery. It was held by the former senior judge of the
Drug Court in the matter
of Sloane, that where there was a threat of violence,
as opposed to actual physical violence, that would not be violent conduct within
the meaning of the
Drug Court Act
11. In the decision of Mr Justice
Mason in Ebsworth, His Honour made the following observations of
Drug Court Act
“A person is not an eligible person if the person is charged with an
offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault. Language
of such generality
does not, in my view, support a distinction urged on us by counsel for Mr
Ebsworth, namely a distinction between
an assault based on a threat of violence
and a battery however slight.”
12. In the same case, Mr Justice Maher, in
agreement with Mr Justcie Mason, also made the point that had been raised in
Chandler that
the use of the word “charged” in
, suggests very
strongly that it is the elements of the charge which are significant, not the
particular conduct.
13. The first of other cases to which I have been
referred has been a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R. v Butcher
VR 43) , which amounted to an offer of violence as opposed to actual
violence. In that case, the victim was killed by the use of
a knife. It was held
however, that it was the offer of violence that created the offence so far as
that defendant Butcher was concerned.
What was described there as
“constructive violence”, where both putting a person in fear or
seeking to put a person in
fear of being subjected to force, has ”always
been accepted under the common law as a violence sufficient to render a
contemporaneous
larceny, a robbery”. (R. v Butcher ([1986] VR 43- @ p50.7
14. The final decision to which I have been referred is that
of R. v Macrossen,
[1991] TASSC 1
(1991) Tas R 1
which was an application under the Tasmanian
Criminal Code to declare the defendant a “dangerous criminal” after
been charged with an offence that purportedly included an element of
violence. In that case violent threats had been made in a letter
which had been
intercepted by somebody other than the person to whom it was addressed. The
Tasmanian Supreme Court, approving the
decision in R. v Butcher, held that the
sending of the letter containing a threat to kill was capable of constituting a
crime involving
an element of violence.
15. On behalf of the defence I am
asked to distinguish those cases from the present set of circumstances on an
analysis of the facts,
because those matters of robbery that were considered in
the above Drug Court cases have been cases where there has been, for good
reason, an apprehension of immediate physical harm. And there was clearly an
immediacy in the threat of harm in each of the robbery
cases when a baseball
bat, a syringe and a piece of wood with a nail through it or a knife, were held
out in threat to a person.
Here, in examining the facts in relation to the two
referred charges under
, the two police officers
concerned were not present, the threats overheard by somebody else. As to the
facts in relation to the
charges under
, in the first
charge, the victim Gatt was not present and the threat was made to his mother.
In the second charge the other threatened
person, although present, was on the
other side of cell doors and not really in immediate harm.
difficult to read the words “
threatens to do or cause...........any
injury or detriment to any person
sections 322
in any way other than that they can include a threat of violent
conduct as an element of the offence. It is also difficult for me
reason for distinguishing between a threat of violent conduct in that context,
and a threat that causes a person to fear
being subject to force when there was
a contemporaneous larceny that would make it a robbery. In addition, the threat
given to Mr
Gatt when the offender was at his mother’s house quite clearly
had within the factual circumstances of the offence, constructive
violence that
was both real and immediate. So that even were proximity relevant, and I am not
certain that it is, it is my view that
there was a sufficient degree of
proximity in the facts relevant to that charge to render the behaviour violent
conduct within the
meaning of the
Drug Court Act
17. I therefore find
that the four offences referred to this Court are offences which involve violent
conduct within the meaning of
Drug Court Act
and in respect of
those offences the applicant is not an eligible person.
