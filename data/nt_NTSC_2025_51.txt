IN THE SUPREME COURT
OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY
OF AUSTRALIA
AT ALICE SPRINGS
In the Estate of Norton
[2025] NTSC 51
No. 2024-03378-SC
IN THE ESTATE of PATRICIA ELSIE NORTON (deceased) late of 4/56 Bradshaw
Drive, Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia
IN THE MATTER of an application to prove and admit to probate a copy of
the Will of PATRICIA ELSIE NORTON
CORAM: GRANT CJ
REASONS FOR ORDER
on 24 July 2025)
[1] The deceased
died on 25 July 2024 at the age of 87 years. The deceased executed a Will on 10
August 2022 in compliance with the
formal requirements. The total value of the
deceased’s estate is estimated at $226,812. Under the terms of the Will,
deceased’s estate is to be divided equally between her daughters Jane
Bernadette Miller and Anne-Marie Temple. They are aged
50 and 53 years
respectively. The deceased was not married at the time of her death and the two
daughters are her only issue. The
deceased’s daughters would also be
solely entitled to the estate under the rules of intestacy.
[2] Under the
terms of the Will, the deceased appointed Jane Bernadette Miller and David
Andrew Temple as her executors. David Andrew
Temple has subsequently renounced
appointment as an executor as he is unable to assume that role. Jane Bernadette
Miller has made
an application for probate and has filed all necessary
affidavits for that purpose. She now makes this separate application that
certified copy of the Will be admitted to probate. That separate application is
necessitated by the fact that a grant of probate
ordinarily requires the
production of the original Will.
[3] The original
Will cannot be located and only a certified copy of that Will is in the
possession of the applicant. In circumstances
where the original Will cannot be
produced after the death of the testator, a presumption of revocation arises.
That is, there is
a rebuttable presumption that the deceased destroyed the
original of the Will with the intention of revoking it. The strength of
presumption will depend upon the circumstances, and if it is not rebutted an
intestacy will result and the deceased estate will
be distributed according to
the statutory rules on intestacy. This Court has power to find that the
presumption has been rebutted,
to recognise that the original of the Will has
been lost, and to admit a copy of it to probate.
[4] The onus of
rebutting the presumption of revocation is on the person applying to the court
for proof of a copy of the original
Will. That requires the applicant to
establish that it is more likely than not that the deceased did not destroy the
Will with the
intention of revoking it, and that the original of the document
has simply been lost or misplaced: see
Cahill v Rhodes
[2002] NSWSC 561

[5] The evidence
in this matter, scant though it is, is sufficient to establish that the
applicant travelled from her home in Queenstown
in Tasmania to Alice Springs to
look after her mother prior to her death. The applicant relocated to Tasmania
following the death
of the deceased. At some time between 10 and 18 November
2024, an envelope containing the original Will and probate forms was lost
the process of relocation. The applicant has conducted exhaustive searches of
all her vehicles and property and the original
Will and probate documents cannot
be located. The applicant has in her possession a copy of the Will. That copy
was certified to
be a true copy of the original Will by a Commissioner for Oaths
who sighted the original Will before it was lost. That certified
copy of the
Will is available because it was submitted to the Court Registry on 9 August
2024 as part of the original application
for probate.
[6] On the basis
of that evidence, I find that it is more likely than not that the deceased did
not destroy the original Will with
the intention of revoking it, and that the
original of the document has simply been lost or misplaced.
[7] I find that
the presumption of revocation has been rebutted and I make the following
copy of the Will executed on 10 August 2022 and certified as a true copy on 9
October 2024 is proved and admitted to probate.
of the estate of the late Patricia Elsie Norton is granted to Jane Bernadette
costs of this application are to be paid out of the estate of Patricia Elsie
