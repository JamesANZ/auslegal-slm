167 Hawthorn Road, Caulfield North.
APPEARANCES
Mr Robert Gluyas for the Responsible Authority.
Mr I McP Pitt, Solicitor of Best Hooper Solicitors for the Applicant for Review.
REASONS FOR DECISION
February 1998 the Council issued Permit No. 9431 under the
Glen Eira Planning Scheme for the development and use of the land for
purpose of 26 independent living units and associated car parking and
facilities. The permit was issued at the direction of
the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal in Appeal No. 1997/82379. The permit did not contain any
condition imposing a public open space
requirement.
July 1998 the Council issued Permit GE10048 for the
subdivision of the subject land into 26 lots in accordance with endorsed plans.
None of the permit conditions imposed a public open space requirement.
By letter dated 8
July 1998 the Council advised the Applicant that
it was unable to issue a Statement of Compliance until the payment of a public
space contribution had been made.
In a written submission Mr Pitt referred to a decision of the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal in
Eddie Barron Constructions Pty Ltd v City of Pakenham
(1990) 6 AATR 10.
After discussing the issues raised in this
decision, Mr Pitt submitted that upon granting and issuing the permit to
subdivide the
appeal site the Council had ceased its functions as a Responsible
Authority and that its further responsibility in respect of the
subdivision of
the land was as a Council under the
Subdivision Act
and that it was
obliged to comply with its mandatory duty under
of that Act to issue a
Statement of Compliance. He further submitted that a public open space
requirement may only be imposed by
a Council under
Subdivision
and that it must make that requirement as a
Responsible
Planning and Environment Act
and that no
requirement had been made in respect to the use and development of the land for
a public open space requirement until
the Council had ceased its functions as a
Responsible Authority. He submitted that the Council may not validity impose a
open space requirements in the circumstances of the subdivision of the
land and that the proposed condition precedent requiring payment
of the public
open space requirement before a Statement of Compliance was granted was
At the conclusion of the Hearing, the Tribunal announced that having heard the
submission on behalf of the Responsible Authority
from Mr Gluyas and from Mr
Pitt on behalf of the Applicant for Review that it believed Mr Pitt's
submission was correct and that
the City of Glen Eira was not entitled to
refuse to issue a Statement of Compliance contingent on payment of the public
contribution.
Having considered the matter again the Tribunal is of the view that Mr Pitt's
submission is correct and it will make an order to
that effect.
The order of the Tribunal is that the City of Glen Eira was not entitled to
refuse to issue a Statement of Compliance contingent
on payment of a public
open space contribution.
