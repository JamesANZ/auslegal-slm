JERRARD JA:
In this application I have read the
reasons for judgment and orders proposed by Keane JA, and respectfully agree
with those. I add
only that the senior counsel for the respondents argued the
existing agreement between the respondents and the applicant satisfied

that Act came into force, and even though it was not expressly described as an

I agree with Keane JA that leave should not now be granted
to the applicant to
broaden its challenge to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.
The applicant seeks leave, pursuant to
District Court of Queensland Act 1967
(Qld), to appeal against the
decision of the District Court, on appeal from the Commercial and Consumer
Tribunal ("the Tribunal"),
that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine a
claim by the respondents under the
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act

respondents that the respondents'

[5] In this Court, the pressure of argument focussed attention more closely
on the point that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is in respect
of "site agreement

I shall return to
this point after first addressing the issue in respect of which the application
for leave to appeal was originally
A manufactured home?
[6] It is well established that an application for leave to appeal

a section which was originally a caravan and other sections
which include an
annexe and a deck. The annexe is attached to the side of the caravan. It is of

stakes in the ground. The evidence before the Tribunal was to the effect that

Residential Tenancies Act 1994
(Qld) ("the RTA") which provides that "a caravan is a trailer ... that, as
originally designed, was capable of being registered under

[11] The applicant submitted that "[t]he error of law at the heart of the
appeal is whether the relevant home structure properly fell
definition of a 'manufactured home' under the MHRP [Act] or a 'caravan' under
the [RTA]". The applicant urged the proposition
"once a caravan always a
caravan irrespective of the modifications" to it. The applicant emphasised that
the caravan which has been
incorporated into the structure was, as originally
designed, a trailer capable of being registered as a caravan. For that reason,
so the applicant argues, the respondents' home cannot be regarded as a
manufactured home.
[12] It is important that the question which the applicant seeks to agitate
before this Court is considered in its factual context
rather than in the
abstract. The dispute between the parties has arisen because of the
respondents' assertion that they are entitled
to the provision of a site
agreement in respect of their home. It is in the context of this dispute that
one must address the question
whether the structure in which the respondents
live, and in respect of which they assert their claim for a site agreement, is a
"manufactured
which has the other characteristics required by
other characteristics are not presently in controversy. The question,
therefore, is whether "the structure" in which the
respondents dwell is a
"caravan" under s 3A of the RTA.
[13] Crucial to the argument which the applicant sought to advance is the
contention that the learned District Court judge erred in
having regard to the
evidence of the structural changes to the caravan. The applicant stressed that
the structure was originally
designed as a caravan. The applicant argued that
the answer to the question whether a trailer is a caravan is to be determined by
reference to its original design, and that the answer to this question cannot be
affected by "subjective assessments" of the effect
of modifications to a
caravan. But the question, having regard to the facts of this case, is not
one element of the structure in respect of which
the respondents seek a site agreement. It is about the proper description of
does not invite a notional dismantling of the structure in
question, nor does it require some form of historical inquiry into the
provenance of the components of the structure. The inconvenience of either
approach is obvious, but it is not necessary to have
resort to arguments from
inconvenience. It is clear from the language of the statute that the

as it exists on site
effect of the legislation falls to be considered.
[15] The applicant's argument fails to surmount the obstacle that both the
Tribunal and the District Court proceeded on the basis
that, as a matter of
fact, the respondents' home was found to be one integrated residential
structure. There was nothing "subjective"
an objective appraisal of the construction and function of the structure.
Considered as one
structure, the respondents' home does not meet the definition
of a "caravan" within the meaning of the
. As the learned District
Court judge held, the structure "is no longer a trailer at all because of what
has happened to it ... Functionally,
it has become one structure ...". This
finding of fact is fatal to the applicant's argument.
[16] There being no basis for a challenge to the finding of fact which forms
the basis of the decisions below, there is no prospect
that an appeal will
The broader jurisdictional dispute
[17] As was mentioned earlier, in the course of argument in this
Court, attention was focused upon the circumstance that, under s
, jurisdiction was conferred upon the Tribunal in respect of "site agreement
dispute[s]". The term "site agreement dispute" is defined
in Sch 2 of the
to mean "a dispute between the parties to a site agreement about the
parties' rights and obligations under the agreement or this
Act". It would
appear, therefore, that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is confined to disputes
between persons who are actually parties
to an existing site agreement.
[18] Senior Counsel for the applicant raised for the first time in oral
argument before this Court the contention that the
did not confer
that a site agreement be
granted by the park owner or made between the parties. On the footing that the
respondents' claim before
the Tribunal was that a site agreement be entered into
(and thus, necessarily, that there was no site agreement about which there
be a "site agreement dispute"), it was contended that the Tribunal should have
decided that it had no jurisdiction to entertain
the dispute between the
[19] Senior Counsel for the applicant argued that this question was one of
law which raised no disadvantage to the respondents in
terms of procedural
and so should be
determined by this Court especially bearing in mind that, if the Tribunal had no
between the parties, then jurisdiction
could not be conferred on the Tribunal by agreement, estoppel or waiver.
[20] Senior Counsel for the respondents argued that the parties had entered
into a site agreement on 14 January 2004 in the sense
that they had entered into
an agreement relating to the respondents' occupation of the site of their home.
Because that agreement
was not appropriate for the purposes of the
respondents had called upon the applicant to provide a written agreement in
conformity with
of the MHRP. It was emphasised on behalf of the
respondents that, in their statement of claim in the Tribunal, the respondents
relied upon this agreement, and that the applicant had not sought to put in
issue whether this agreement was a site agreement sufficient
to found a site
agreement dispute.
[21] The position taken by the applicant is certainly arguable, but, on the
other hand, it is not clear that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction
dispute for the reasons now sought to be agitated by the applicant. It is to be
emphasised that the proceeding before this
Court is an application for leave to
appeal. Given that the respondent did not seek to agitate this broader question
at any stage
prior to the oral argument in this Court; and, given that it is
arguable that the Tribunal had jurisdiction notwithstanding the point
to be raised, this Court should not, in my respectful opinion, be disposed, as a
matter of discretion, to grant leave
to the applicant to agitate this broader
Conclusion and orders
[22] Accordingly, in my respectful opinion, the application for
leave to appeal should be dismissed and the applicant should pay the
respondents' costs to be assessed on the standard basis.
I agree with what has been said by Jerrard and Keane
JJA. Leave to appeal should be refused.
