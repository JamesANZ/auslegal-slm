LAURO v MINTER ELLISON (A FIRM)
[2025] SASCA 116
Court of Appeal – Civil: Livesey P and Bleby JA
Introduction
time ago, the law firm, Minter Ellison, represented Mr Natale Lauro in various
litigation. Minter Ellison claims to be owed
legal fees. Mr Lauro has sought a
taxation of those fees on a solicitor and client basis. That taxation has not
progressed very
far. Mr Lauro has made a number of complaints. These include
objections to various judicial officers sitting on the grounds of
Lauro’s litigation guardian is his son, Mr E Lauro. Without objection
from Minter Ellison, he has usually represented his
is an application for leave to appeal concerning, amongst other matters, an
objection to a judge sitting on the taxation on
the grounds of ostensible bias,
as well as an objection to a single judge of the General Division sitting on an
appeal against that
and other decisions of the taxing judge on the grounds of
ostensible bias. Mr Lauro had made three applications for the recusal
disqualification of the appeal
appeal judge refused Mr Lauro leave to appeal, and he dismissed those aspects of
the appeal which had been the subject of a grant
of leave to appeal by the
taxing judge. Mr Lauro’s proposed appeal appears to be concerned
principally with the orders made
at the time of the last of the appeal
judge’s decisions.
the following reasons, leave to appeal should be
Preliminary applications
this week, Mr E Lauro complained about being confined to a 3-page limit for his
written submissions. He sought more time
to make further written submissions by
way of reply. The written submissions of Minter Ellison introduced no new,
substantive issues
requiring reply. Having considered the proposed appeal
grounds, the submissions and the materials relied on, which included 5
pages of attachments, we are satisfied that no further time should be
Mr E Lauro then applied for an adjournment, advising the Court by
Yesterday, Mr Eric Lauro required urgent medical attention
and was admitted in the Emergency Department of the Royal Adelaide Hospital,
where he currently remains.
In the circumstances, it is respectfully asked that tomorrow’s hearing
regarding objections to the [H]onourable President Livesey
and Justice Bleby
sitting in this appeal and the question of leave to appeal, be vacated and
adjourned to a new date, within 7 days
of Mr Eric Lauro’s discharge
and end of his convalescence period.
aside the obvious points that no medical certificate was produced concerning Mr
E Lauro, and that there was no detail given
or prognosis, or the likely period of convalescence, the parties have had a
reasonable opportunity
to make their written submissions.
the case of Mr Lauro, those written submissions supplemented very detailed
grounds of appeal as well as grounds setting out the
case for leave to appeal.
Court may, in its discretion, deal with applications for leave to appeal
“on the papers”.
taxation in this matter has been delayed for a considerable period. It is
desirable that it proceed. In the circumstances
outlined, particularly given
the material before the Court, it is appropriate to determine leave to appeal on
the papers without
further delay.
is not the first time Mr Lauro has been before the Court of Appeal. Some time
ago, there was litigation over a default judgment
entered against Mr Lauro in
the District Court,
as well as over
a default judgment entered in the Magistrates
Bleby JA decided one of
those cases in 2020.
this matter was set down, it was disclosed to the parties that, when in
practice, Livesey P had been retained as a barrister
by Minter Ellison in
connection with various matters on behalf of various clients of Minter Ellison.
In addition, it was disclosed
to the parties that his wife had been, but was no
longer, employed as a solicitor by Minter Ellison. It was disclosed to the
that there had been no involvement by Livesey P or his wife in any Lauro
litigation.
Lauro objected to Livesey P and Bleby JA hearing the present application on the
grounds of ostensible bias.
objections appeared to be a combination of pre-judgment (in the case of Bleby
JA) and association (in the case of Livesey P and
Bleby JA). A large number of
the matters raised by Mr E Lauro were irrelevant, especially where they
concerned the decisions made
on disqualification by other judges in other
contexts, or old complaints. The same may be said about decisions made on
disqualification
by the present coram in unrelated
litigation.

barristers more than five years ago, the fair-minded
lay observer may be taken
to know that barristers will advise and represent a number of clients when
acting on instructions from

practice. An example is the retainer of Bleby JA by Minter Ellison in

of law and apprehended bias—Auxiliary Associate Justice Flourentzou
(“her Honour”):
2.1 The learned Judge erred
by dismissing the appeal from her Honour’s refusal to recuse herself and
by failing to address
her Honour’s conduct, errors in fact and/or law or

not limited to her Honour:
2.1.1 failing to consider relevant matters
2.1.2 considering and giving weight to irrelevant matters;
2.1.3 conflating the threshold issue of the Respondent’s standing with
and before any discretionary consideration of time extension,
notwithstanding
the Respondent’s disclosure of corporate restructure and changes in its
partnership composition;
2.1.4 prejudging matters that were not argued including the
Respondent’s standing;
2.1.5 failing to take action with respect to Respondent’s obligation
to serve a Notice of Acting, as raised by the Appellant’s
Guardian at the hearing on 4 March 2025;
2.1.6 failing to adequately address or explain the rationale for procedural
decisions that gave rise to reasonable apprehension of
bias and procedural
unfairness, including procedural orders made in the absence of the Appellant or
his Litigation Guardian, and
thereafter failing to afford the Appellant a
genuine opportunity to vary the timetabling and programming of her

3.1 The learned
Judge erred in finding that a fair-minded lay observer would not reasonably
apprehend that his Honour might not bring
an impartial and unprejudiced mind to
the determination of the appeal against Auxiliary Associate Justice Flourentzou.
3.2 The learned Judge erred in refusing to recuse himself, where
circumstances, individually or cumulatively, gave rise to a reasonable
apprehension of bias, thereby prejudicing the Appellant and occasioning a
miscarriage of justice, by reason of the learned Judge’s:
3.2.1 Case management of the appeal.
3.2.2 Professional and personal associations with, or involving, the
Respondent.
3.2.3 Professional association with another law firm that had previously
acted against the Appellant, including associations involving

3.2.4 Familial relationships with other members of the judiciary, all of

triggered factual contests (including those relating to the
