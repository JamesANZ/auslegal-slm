STATEMENT OF REASONS
Applicant, TGK, made an Application for the statutory review of the
Administration Order for NFI dated 22 August 2019 (‘the
Application’).
Guardianship and Administration Board (‘the Board’) found that the
requirements of section 51 of the
Guardianship and Administration Act
(‘the Act’) were still satisfied in relation to NFI and
that the continuation of an Administration Order was consistent
principles of section 6 of the Act.
Board was not satisfied that TGK met all of the eligibility requirements set out
in section 54(1)(d) of the Act and was thus not
suitable to be reappointed as
Administrator.
Public Trustee (Tas), who was not represented at the hearing, was appointed as
Administrator in place of TGK. On 31 August 2020
the Public Trustee requested a

Legislation
67(c) of the Act provides for the review of Orders on Application by the
Administrator after holding a hearing.
68 of the Act provides for the making of an Order after review as
(1) On a review under
, the Board may vary or continue a guardianship order or
administration order subject to any conditions or requirements it considers
necessary or the Board may revoke the order.
(2) The Board may make such further orders as it considers necessary in
order to give effect to an order made under subsection (1).
54 of the Act sets out who may be appointed as an Administrator as
(1) The Board may appoint as an administrator of the
estate of a proposed represented person –
(a) The Public Trustee; or
(b) the Public Guardian; or
(c) a trustee company within the meaning of the
Companies Act 1953
(d) any other person, including the guardian of the proposed represented
person, who consents to act as administrator if the Board
is satisfied that
(i) the person will act in the best interests of the proposed represented
person; and
(ii) the person is not in a position where his or her interests conflict or
may conflict with the interests of the proposed represented

estate of the proposed represented person; and
(iv) the person has sufficient expertise to administer the
(2) In determining whether a person is suitable to act as the
administrator of the estate of a proposed represented person, the Board
take into account –
(a) the wishes of the proposed represented person, so far as they can be
ascertained; and
(b) the compatibility of the person proposed as administrator with the
proposed represented person and with his or her guardian, if
evidence before the Board comprised the HCPR provided by Dr Sue Lizner and filed
by the Applicant. Dr Lizner confirmed a diagnosis
of dementia which was
diagnosed in 2018, the symptoms of which had then been evident for three or four
years. Her cognition and mobility
were continuing to decline.
a result of the disability, it was Dr Lizner’s opinion that NFI remained
unable to understand or make executive decisions
and that she was thus unable to
appreciate the nature and extent of her estate or manage her finances
uncontradicted medical evidence was accepted by the Board. Taking into account
that evidence and the considerations set out in
section 51(2) and (3) of the
Act, the Board is satisfied in all the circumstances that the need for the
appointment of an administrator
of NFI’s estate continues.
wished to continue in the role of Administrator for her mother, NFI. The Board
therefore considered whether she satisfied the
criteria set out in sections
(1)(d)(i)-(iv) of the Act.
Board did not receive an Annual Report from TGK until the day of the hearing. It
did not comply with the reporting requirements
of section 63 of the Act. It was
incomplete and contained very little detail explaining NFI’s financial
circumstances. It did
not reconcile income and expenditure or assets and
liabilities. No work sheets were completed setting out income and expenditure
over the period. An incomplete selection of bills and receipts was provided
without any explanation of their relevance. A Retirement
Benefit Fund statement
of pension was provided but was not included as income along with the Centrelink
pension in the Annual Report.
TGK advised, ‘I didn’t know what to
send. I am not computer literate. I just grabbed bills that I could
Annual Report stated that there had been no significant changes in NFI’s
finances during the administration. The Westpac
bank statement that was
provided, however, showed that there had been substantial withdrawals amounting
to $27,000 between 16 June
2019 and 4 June 2020. The total bank account balances
reported in the Annual Report amounted to $57,890.71. The balances were not
substantiated with documentation. A further Commonwealth account showed a
balance of $2,159.27 which was not included in the Annual
Report. It was clear
that the withdrawals constituted a substantial part of NFI’s estate. When
asked about this, TGK was vague
in her answers, saying that there was car
registration, house insurance and respite care. She went on to say that she was
with her mother 95 percent of the time and had only obtained a
carer’s allowance for the last 4 weeks since her husband lost
through COVID-19. She said,
‘so really I’ve had to pull a
wage to live here as well. I’ve just had bills to pay as well as
asked if she had used her mother’s money for ‘a
wage’ to pay her own bills she said ‘no, not really. Just
food.’ In trying to explain some of the significant withdrawals she
volunteered ‘I took $600 a week over 12 months.’
calculation and then said
“that’s $9,000 I would have had
over the year. That’s what I would have took (sic) out.” The Board
a weekly sum of $600 amounts to $31,200 over 12 months, not the
$9,000 she calculated. No such sums for ‘wages’ were
accounted for
in the Annual Report. The Act does not authorise remuneration of a private
administrator.
could not identify what the substantial individual withdrawals had been spent
on. When asked about a withdrawal of $2,000 on 4
June 2020 she said ‘I
can’t remember to be honest. I’ve got paperwork
everywhere.’
When questioned about a withdrawal of $12,000 on 16
June 2019 she said ‘I think we had rego, house insurance and bathroom
renovations
we were going to do.’ She advised that she did not do these
works ‘because Mum wouldn’t let me rip it out even
wasn’t in her right mind.’ When asked to identify other large
withdrawals, one of $7,000 and three of $2,000
she said that her mother
‘took some money out and gave my girls $2,000 each when she was really
When asked if she understood the duty for an administrator
to obtain approval for gifts, TGK said, ‘it wasn’t really a
– just some bills the girls had.’ She said they would pay it back.
When asked to comment on the lack of evidence
of gifts or loans in her report

was Mum’s money and that it was up to her... Mum’s always helped

TGK would take her mother to the bank herself in her wheelchair, but sometimes
the nurses, who came in three times a week,
would take her to get money out. She
told the Board that NFI kept $1,500 in the house for paying bills. She added:
‘I shouldn’t
tell you this, she would die. She thinks someone will
kill her for the money.’
inadequacy of the Annual Report and TGK’s failure to comply with the
requirements of the Board set out in the Act and the
Administrator’s Handbook; her inability to explain the deficiencies in
accounting; the depletion and improper use of
her mother’s money under the
current Order and her obvious failure to appreciate the role and duties of an
Administrator at
all satisfied the Board that TGK was not able to act in
NFI’s best interests. There was a mingling of her mother’s finances
and her own. Her actions indicated a sense of entitlement to use her
mother’s money for herself as and when she saw fit because
she was caring
for her, and because she and her daughters were the only family. This
demonstrated a conflict of interest of which
TGK did not appear to understand.
Her inability to appreciate that there were any deficiencies in her performance
as Administrator
satisfied the Board that, at best, she did not have sufficient
expertise or competence to be considered for reappointment as
Administrator.
Board found that NFI is a person with a disability; is unable as a result of the
disability to make reasonable judgments in matters
relating to all of her estate
and is in need of an Administrator.
Accordingly
the Board Orders that:
Administration Order for NFI made on 22 August 2019 has been reviewed and varied
and from this day the Order is:
Public Trustee (Tas) is appointed as Administrator of the estate of
This Order remains in effect until 18 August
