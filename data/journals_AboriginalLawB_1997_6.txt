Full Federal Court
Unreported, 18 November, 1996
Casenote by Richard Bartlett
Two unexpected developments in the early history of the National Native Title
Tribunal ('the NNTT') have been:
the adoption by Presidential and some other members of the NNTT of a pattern
of decision-making favouring non-Aboriginal settlement,
and development over
protection of native title and the right to negotiate; and
a determination by the Federal Court to provide such protection for native
title as ensures that holders 'enjoy fully their right
and interests' as
declared in the Preamble to the
Native Title Act 1993
(Cth) ('the
The Federal Court has become the protector of native title rights, in
considerable contrast to the NNTT.
Under the expedited procedure, proposals for grants of mining or exploration
tenements may be exempted from the duty to negotiate
requirement under the NTA.
The NNTT must determine whether the grant is an act which attracts the expedited
procedure under
because it 'does not':
'(a) ... directly interfere with the community life ... ;
'(b) ... interfere with areas or sites of particular significance ... ; or
'(c) ... involve major disturbance to any land or waters concerned ...
The NNTT had generally held that the grant of an exploration licence under
mining legislation attracts the expedited procedure by:
focusing upon the inquiry whether the grant was 'likely' to result in
interference as a consequence of the
relying on a presumption that the government will ensure that miners do not
cause interference under
disregarding miners' intentions accordingly;
relying on a presumption that the
Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972
provides effective protection for sites of
significance;
disregarding the rights and capacity of miners under such grants to cause
interference.
An exception from this pattern of decision-making by the NNTT were the
decisions of Member Kim Wilson, who had rejected reliance on
presumption.
It is not surprising that the
State of Western Australia sought to challenge his different approach before the
Federal Court.
The Federal Court decisively rejected the focus of inquiry and presumptions
generally followed by the NNTT in
Western Australia v Ben Ward on behalf of
Miriuwung Gajerrong Peoples
involved the proposed grant of an exploration licence under the
(WA). The State claimed, in accord with its standard practice with
respect to all such grants, that the grant attracted the expedited
The grantee party before the NNTT did not appear, but declared that the native
title party must prove any interference,
and would not enter into any heritage
survey arrangement. Member Wilson held that the proposed grant would not attract
the expedited
procedure, because the native title parties had demonstrated 'real
concerns about the likelihood' of interference with sites of significance.
Evidence relied upon by Member Wilson challenged the efficacy of the protection
conferred by the
Aboriginal Heritage Act
, in the experience of the native title
parties, with respect to the grantee party and other miners.
The State of Western Australia appealed on relatively narrow grounds,
challenging:
the disregard of the presumption that the grantee party would act lawfully,
and, implicitly, that the
Aboriginal Heritage Act
provided adequate
protection;
an inquiry limited to a finding of 'real concerns' as to interference as not
meeting the requirements of s237(b).
But the nature of the grounds of appeal required Lee J in the Federal Court
to comprehensively examine the nature of the inquiry required
to be conducted by
the NNTT with respect to acts claimed to attract the expedited procedure. Lee J
had regard to the 'interdependent
operation' (p27) and the 'context' (pp 29, 34)
of the subdivision of the NTA providing for the right to negotiate, and
emphasised:
the limits upon the Minister's power of exclusion under
from the right to negotiate, requiring that the act have only 'minimal effect on
any native title', and consultation with
native title parties as to access;
the complex consideration demanded of the NNTT in making a determination
that an act may or may not be done;
the importance of the right to negotiate as indicated in the recognition and
protection of native title declared in
Lee J concluded that in contradistinction to negotiation or the complex
consideration demanded under
, the determination as to the application of the
expedited procedure was intended 'to be made as speedily as possible', and that
inquiry should not have regard to 'detailed anthropological and sociological
material or economic analysis' (pp29-30). Accordingly,
the NNTT should only
determine that an act attracted the expedited procedure if it was 'satisfied
that no issue has been seriously
raised that would make it appropriate for the
ordinary processes of the Act to be followed in respect of negotiation and
determination'
(p33), that is, only if it is 'patent' that no matter required to
be considered under a
determination could be raised as a serious issue
In such an inquiry, Lee J suggested that the NNTT should have regard to the
right and powers to be conferred by the proposed grant,
and the 'potential
consequences' made possible by the exercise of those rights and powers
.. there is nothing to support the contention that it is a requirement of the
subsection [32(4)] that the Tribunal receive or obtain
material to enable it to
make findings as to the future occurrence of events determined on a balance of
probabilities or as a matter
of likelihood' (p31).
In other words, the proper focus of the inquiry upon an expedited procedure
determination is the capacity of the grantee party under
the proposed grant, not
presumptions as to the future conduct of the grantee party or as to the efficacy
of the protection of the
Aboriginal Heritage Act
The Federal Court, upon such analysis, dismissed the State's appeal,
concluding that the NNTT was satisfied that the grant of an exploration
would create rights the exercise of which had the capacity to interfere with
areas or sites of significance (pp35, 27). The
decision has dramatically changed
the nature of the inquiry by the NNTT. The focus is now upon the nature of the
grant itself, not
benign presumptions as to future behaviour by miners.
The prior general practice of the NNTT was to rely on presumptions as to
non-interference by miners, and accordingly disregard their
intentions.
Western Australia v Ben Ward
also suggested that the professed intentions
were irrelevant, but for very different reasons and with very different results.
analysis was confirmed in a decision upon another appeal by the State from
the NNTT released the same day:
Western Australia v Bropho
behalf of Swan River and Swan Valley Nyungah.
Lee J declared that material as to the present intentions of a grantee party was
'not relevant' (p6) and exclusion of such material
from consideration involved
no error of law (p7).
The analysis of Lee J entailed a comprehensive examination of the purposes of
Native Title Act
, with emphasis upon the recognition and protection
of native title mandated therein. In its application to the expedited procedure,
it rejected the previous NNTT trend favouring non-Aboriginal settlement and
development over the protection of native title. The
decision will deny reliance
on the expedited procedure where any serious issue is raised as to interference
prescribed by
But it must also raise questions as to the balance adopted
by the NNTT in other decisions, such as
- where the NNTT ordered the
override of native title.
