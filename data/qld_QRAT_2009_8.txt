Cuddihy v Queensland Racing [2009] QRAT 8 (5 May 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
Wayne William Cuddihy
RESPONDENT:
Queensland Racing
APPEARANCES:
Wayne William Cuddihy on his own behalf and Mr W Birch, steward for
Queensland Racing
Mr Leo Williams AO – Chairman
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
On 23 February 2009 at the Gold Coast Turf Club some 65 track riders present
at the Club were instructed to present themselves for
the purpose of providing a
sample of urine. Mr Wayne Cuddihy the appellant in this matter was
one of those riders. The sample that
he provided was found to have present in
it a prohibited substance at a time when he had been riding track work. He is a
track work rider and he was charged under AR81 which reads:
Any rider commits an offence and may be penalised if –
(a) A sample taken from him is found upon analysis to contain the
presence of a substance banned by AR.81B.
It is not necessary to go into the history of the substance being found in
the track work rider’s system. Suffice to say this
appeal has been lodged
against the severity of penalty imposed upon him.
Mr Cuddihy had attended a music festival on the previous Saturday at the
Coast and admitted to the consumption of Ecstasy. That substance
showed in his
urine sample on testing and the stewards determined that it was irrelevant for
the purposes of penalty to identify
whether the level of concentration was high
or low other than that such level exceeded the threshold allowed under the
relevant Rules
of Racing and the protocols published thereunder. Mr Cuddihy
pleaded guilty and was disqualified for a period of nine months which
reduced to six months on the condition that he undertook a drug rehabilitation
In his appearance before this Tribunal Mr Cuddihy confirmed that his main
occupation was that of a track work rider and his only other
income was from
some part-time employment in a butcher shop. His concerns are that he will not
be able to meet his commitments and
will in all probability have to cease his
involvement in the racing industry if this penalty is to be maintained and he
this Tribunal to reduce the penalty to facilitate his wishes in that
The stewards have embarked upon a strategy to eliminate the use of
recreational drugs in jockeys, track work riders and all other
associated with the Racing Industry particularly of those persons who are
involved in the riding and handling of thoroughbred
racehorses. It was for
these reasons that the stewards imposed a disqualification of effectively six
months identifying that the
industry does not want persons in the industry when
affected by drugs or alcohol.
The Tribunal has on previous occasions identified that it is necessary to act
reasonably when imposing penalties and in support the
stewards provided
information as to similar type penalties that had been imposed by stewards
outside Queensland. The most severe
appear to be those imposed in New South
Wales which can in certain instances exceed 12 months disqualification. It is
not, in this Tribunal’s opinion, appropriate that it embark on a
total rehearing of all of the issues other than to confirm
that the stewards
have acted reasonably and that the stewards have obviously taken into account
the representations made by the appellant
in the early stages of the Inquiry as
to the appellant’s work history and future in the industry.
The Tribunal considers the penalty to be appropriate. It is not appropriate,
in the opinion of this Tribunal, to upset the penalty
and the appeal is
therefore dismissed and the deposit is forfeit.
