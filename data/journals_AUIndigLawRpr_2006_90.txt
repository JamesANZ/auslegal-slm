Dear Mr Howard,
Re the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Amendment 2006
The Federal Government has said it wants to change the way we live here on
our land. No one has asked. We, the traditional owners
of the Kunwinjku country
of Arnhem Land, ask them to leave us alone.
We have heard that Health Minister Tony Abbott wants us to cut ceremony time.
They want to audit our Homelands (Outstations) and talk
have heard that they want to remove the permit system to Aboriginal land. They
want to change the Community
Development Employment Program (CDEP), where we
work (especially our young people) - we are paid to work - for the
We ask the Government not to do these things. We ask them not to do these
things so as to save our culture, our religion, our livelihood,
our people.
These are our reasons:
This is the most important. Abbott has told central Australian Aborigines in
Pitjantjatjara lands that spending months on ceremony
doesn’t work in
today’s Western culture. He told an A
angu Pitjantjatjara
Yankunytjatjara meeting that ‘if you’re going to develop a working
culture, you can’t have a
three-month ceremony season and you can’t
take six weeks off because your cousin has died. I wouldn’t imagine that
before white man came (a death) would have stopped hunting.’
He is wrong. Our ceremony is part of our work. That’s why we call it
‘business’. In our country, in Arnhem Land,
ceremony has continued
uninterrupted for a very long time. It is important to our culture, our art and
our moral beliefs.
Does the minister say that Jewish, Christian or Muslim rituals should be
Ceremony is carefully structured, with everyone holding significant roles for
the various important things to be done. It takes a
lot of organisation. People
come from all around the country for these ceremonies. We have to organise
transport, food, healthy places
to live. Work doesn’t stop. Everyone has
to work for ceremony business. Young kids are initiated to learn the hard rules;
don’t want that to stop. Trouble comes when they lose the culture.
If someone has to go into ceremony for 12 months, they ask their boss.
Aboriginal art represents Australia in places such as Venice
and New York. But
this art comes from ceremony. If ceremony is changed, if it is stopped, the art
will stop too.
2 The Outstations
The homeland outstations are very important to the Aboriginal people of
Arnhem Land. These are places where we live and our ancestors,
our parents and
grandparents are buried there; we can pay respect to them. The outstations are
also where we prepare and undertake
many ceremonies that keep our religion and
our beliefs together. Parts of our country, the ceremony grounds are not unlike
your churches,
your mosques, your synagogue - they are sacred sites.
3 The Permit System
The permit system is important because we want to protect the environment,
the rock art and our ceremony ground. Someone who walks
into our country has to
have approval. We ask them to respect our wishes. Balanda (white people)
don’t know which is ceremonial
ground or burial ground, they just walk
anywhere; that’s why we have to have this system.
4 The CDEP (Community Development Employment
Right now the CDEP allows our people, especially our younger people, to work
for the money they get, to learn skills and talents that
work for both the white
community and the Aboriginal community. The Government wants it to work like the
dole, but this is a problem.
For the dole you must apply for jobs every two
weeks or your payments stop. Here there are not very many jobs, so we share the
work so everyone can get paid and all the work can get done. We are
concerned that without the CDEP our young people will be forced
into places such
as Darwin to look for work. This will break up families and expose the young
people to things such as drink and
drugs, which are not here at Gunbalanya.
We have our law. We know how to look after our country. We need to keep
control over our communities. It is the Kunwinjku people,
not the Federal
Government, who hold the solutions for our future.
The politicians, the Prime Minister, are welcome to sit on our land and talk
to us. We can help them to understand.
