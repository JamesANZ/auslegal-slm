of Information Act 1992
On 15 March 2022,
a representative of the Centre for Mining Energy and Natural Resources Law,
which is part of the Law School of the
University of Western Australia

the term ‘FOI’ or ‘freedom
of information’.

complainant access to the requested document under section
26 of the FOI Act

The complainant sought internal review of the agency’s
decision and, by internal review decision dated 2 June 2022, the agency
confirmed the initial decision. The agency advised the complainant that,
although it had considered creating a document to satisfy
complainant’s access application, it had determined that it ‘would
not be able to replicate the information easily
in order to create a document
containing the requested information’.
On 29 June 2022, the
complainant applied to the Information Commissioner
the Commissioner
) for external review of the agency’s
decision. The Commissioner obtained the agency’s FOI file maintained in
of the access application.
Between June 2022 and February 2024,
various communications took place between the Commissioner’s officers and
the parties in
an attempt to resolve the matter by conciliation. Those attempts
were unsuccessful.
On 16 February 2024, one of the Commissioner’s
the officer
) provided the agency with her assessment of the
matter, which was that the agency’s decision under section 26 did not
to be justified and that the agency could give access to the requested
document(s) in the manner described in section 27(1)(g) of
the FOI Act
section 27(1)(g)
). The agency accepted the officer’s assessment
and, in effect, withdrew its reliance on section 26. However, the agency
that the process to give access to the requested document(s) under
section 27(1)(g) would divert a substantial and unreasonable portion
resources away from its other operations under section 20 of the FOI Act
On 6 March 2024, the officer advised the
complainant that the agency accepted the officer’s assessment and now
claimed that
dealing with the access application would divert a substantial and
unreasonable portion of its resources away from its other operations,
described in section 20. The complainant responded and advised the officer that
it was their view that the decision under review
is the decision made by the
agency to refuse access to the document under section 26.
On 11 March
2024, the officer invited the complainant to consider changing the scope of its
access application to reduce the amount
of work required to deal with it. The
complainant responded and repeated its earlier submission that its application
for external
review is in respect of the agency’s decision under section
On 11 September 2024, another of the Commissioner’s officers

assessment that the Commissioner would likely consider the agency’s
under section 20 was justified. The other officer again invited the complainant
to consider narrowing the scope of the access
application, referring to a
previous proposal from the agency outlining the terms of a reduced

advice that it
requires a determination by the Commissioner of the
decision made by the agency in 2022 under section 26’
October 2024, the other officer provided the parties with her assessment of the
matter, which was that the Commissioner would
likely consider the agency’s
claim under section 20 was justified.
The complainant did not accept the
other officer’s assessment and made further submissions.
Commissioner observed that sections 64, 70 and 71 of the FOI Act provide her
with powers to deal with complaints before her on
Section 76(1)(b) of the FOI Act provides that, in dealing with a
complaint, the Commissioner has the power to decide any matter in
relation to
the access application that could, under the FOI Act, have been decided by the
Pearlman v WA A/ Information Commissioner
[2019] WASC 257
Supreme Court concluded that the Commissioner is not
bound to determine
an external review matter by having regard only to the reasons given by the
original decision‑maker: see
[75] and [76].
Section 20 provides
(1) If the agency considers that the work involved in dealing with the access
application would divert a substantial and unreasonable
portion of the
agency’s resources away from its other operations, the agency has to take
reasonable steps to help the applicant
to change the application to reduce the
amount of work needed to deal with it.
(2) If after help has been given to change the access application the agency
still considers that the work involved in dealing with
the application would
divert a substantial and unreasonable portion of the agency’s resources
away from its other operations,
the agency may refuse to deal with the
application.
Section 20 is designed to ensure that the operations of
government agencies are not unduly impeded by agencies having to deal with
unreasonably voluminous access applications. It is one of a number of
provisions in the FOI Act aimed at striking a balance between,
on the one hand,
the public interest in open and accountable government and, on the other hand,
the public interest in the ongoing
effective operation of agencies:

[2009] WAICmr 17
considering all of the material before her, the Commissioner was satisfied that
the agency had taken reasonable steps to assist
the complainant to change the
access application to reduce the amount of work needed to deal with it. On at
least three occasions
during the external review suggestions were put to the
complainant on how the scope of the application could be reduced to a manageable
level. This included a proposal from the agency on two separate occasions to
limit the range of requested documents to specific
document types such as
‘Freedom of Information Management case files’; reducing the date
range of the requested documents;
and limiting the requested documents to those
that were located in the agency’s record keeping system. The
complainant’s
representative declined to engage in discussions to reduce
the scope of the access application. The Commissioner observed that,
section 20 places agencies under a duty to assist applicants, there must be a
corresponding obligation on applicants to work
cooperatively with an agency and
an element of reasonableness must be implied in the process, for the legislation
to work satisfactorily:

The Commissioner accepted the agency’s
submission that to process the access application would require a search of
systems currently used by the agency. The agency explained that it
accesses its business systems via another agency’s network
under a shared
services arrangement and does not have the functionality in its record keeping
systems to extract the information
requested into a discrete document. The
Commissioner noted that the number of potential documents covered by an
application, and
the ease with which the specific documents can be identified
and assessed, are relevant to the question of whether the work involved
dealing with an access application would divert a substantial and unreasonable
portion of an agency’s resources away from
its other operations: see
Ballam and Shire of Toodyay
[2009] WAICmr 4
Commissioner accepted the agency’s submission that the process to be
applied to each of its record keeping systems in an
attempt to extract
information to populate a document, under section 27(1)(g); the detailed
examination of those results required
to identify exempt matter (especially
personal information of private individuals); the editing of those results; and
potential third
party consultation, meant that the work involved in dealing with
the complainant’s access application would divert a substantial
unreasonable portion of the agency’s resources away from its other
operations.
Accordingly, the Commissioner set aside the agency’s
decision and, in substitution, found that the agency was entitled to refuse
deal with the access application under section 20 of the FOI Act.
