REFLECTING ON TEACHING LAW ONLINE AT TWO WESTERN AUSTRALIAN
UNIVERSITIES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
POSITIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCE
CARMELA DE MAIO
I INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Research on learning and teaching online in higher education suggests that
successful learning takes place where there is a student-centred
approach, where
the teacher facilitates rather than lectures, and where a community of practice
is created in which students feel
supported and connected with their peers and
their teachers.
The sudden, unexpected move to online teaching and learning during COVID-19
at most Australian institutions of higher learning meant
that teachers had to
quickly shift their mindsets and adjust teaching practices to suit the new
environment to ensure effective learning
Further, the move to online
teaching at the start of the pandemic was said to ‘not truly [be] an
online experience but a “pedagogical
done in haste
with little thought as to what would constitute an effective and positive online
learning environment for students.
Little research has been done on how to teach legal content and skills to
university students online, due probably to the fact that
this mode of teaching
is not particularly prevalent in law
This adds to the
complexity of the move from more traditional ways of knowing and doing to the
use of new technologies where materials
used in the face-to-face classroom may
not transfer easily to the online learning
environment.
This article outlines my experience with teaching law online at two Western
Australian universities at the beginning of the pandemic
in March 2020. It is
not my intention to compare institutions or students, but to share some of the
initial challenges faced, even
as an experienced educator, in keeping students
engaged in their learning during the first few months of the pandemic. This
also proposes recommendations, based on the literature and my own
experience, for ensuring that law students have a positive and
effective online
learning experience should we be forced to deliver units fully online in the
II CHALLENGES
The key challenges faced were keeping students engaged in their legal studies
and ensuring they were fully ‘present’ while
online. Cognisant of
the research that suggests that face-to-face teaching practices cannot be
transferred directly to the online
environment, I made an effort to adapt
learning materials to suit the online learning
environment.
As both the lecturer
and tutor for students from University A, I was able to change lectures to short
20–30-minute asynchronous
recordings which were placed on the Learning
Management (LMS) site (Collaborate) at the start of each week. As the tutor, I
to make any changes to the learning materials for students from
University B, so although lectures became pre-recorded, asynchronous
they remained two hours in length.
For students from both universities, the previously on-campus classes became
one hour online, synchronous tutorials where the week’s
content was
discussed, and time was spent checking in with students’ wellbeing. After
the online tutorials, answers to any
questions were posted on the LMS for
students to refer to at any time. During the online tutorials for both
universities, the breakout
rooms, chat and polling functions in Collaborate were
utilised to encourage discussions in smaller groups and to check that students
were engaged. All synchronous tutorials were recorded.
Through utilising attendance data found on the LMS, and by recording
attendance to the online tutorials, I noticed that very few students
universities would access the lecture or tutorial recordings and that not all
students would attend the synchronous tutorial
sessions. If students did attend
the synchronous tutorial sessions, almost all of them (from both institutions)
would not turn on
their cameras, although I always had my camera on. Not
‘seeing’ my students online reduced the student presence and thus
their engagement in their learning.
III REFLECTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Considering the literature and my own experience of teaching online during
the pandemic, the following recommendations for a positive
online learning
experience may prove useful:
1. Deliver materials synchronously and asynchronously, to allow for a variety
of ways to engage students;
2. Unpack content into smaller, digestible pieces (eg, 20–30 minutes of
pre-recorded lectures);
3. Make use of the technology to encourage engagement (eg, make use of
breakout rooms, chats, and polling);
4. Give and receive feedback continuously to ensure students understand the
content and feel supported;
5. Be present online by showing your face and encouraging students to do
likewise as this may help students feel a greater level of
connectedness in the
online learning environment;
6. Be organised – upload materials in advance;
7. Be flexible – if technology or the internet fails, find another
means or day to communicate;
8. Be kind to yourself and your students.
IV CONCLUSION
The sudden move to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic forced many
of us to rethink how our teaching practices could be applied
to the online
environment to ensure a positive online learning experience for students. This
article outlines the challenges I faced
with engaging students online. The
recommendations above are based on the literature and my personal experience.
Although most Australian
law schools have returned to a predominantly on-campus
mode of teaching, applying the lessons learnt during the pandemic may prove
useful should we be forced to move to an online learning environment in the
