The reviewable decision is about the calculation of the claimant’s
pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE) which concerns the amount
of weekly payments
of statutory benefits that are payable under Division 3.3 of the
Accidents Injuries Act 2017
(the MAI Act), and is therefore a merit review
matter under Schedule 2(1)(a) of the MAI Act.
I make the following determinations:

claimant’s PAWE as $562.26 is set aside.
claimant’s PAWE figure is $1,306.
insurer is to pay the claimant back payments in accordance with this decision.
A brief statement setting out my reasons for the decision is set
STATEMENT OF REASONS
Rauf (the claimant) was involved in a three-vehicle motor accident on
November 2024. The claimant was the driver of a car that was stationary at
traffic lights when a vehicle hit the vehicle behind
him which then collided
into the rear of the claimant’s car.
claimant says he sustained injuries to his cervical spine, right shoulder and
lumbar spine and an acute stress disorder as a result
of the motor accident.
claimant made a claim for statutory benefits with AAI Limited t/as GIO (the
insurer), the third-party insurer of the vehicle that
he says caused the
the time of the motor accident, the claimant was a self-employed Uber and Didi
rideshare driver.
insurer made the following decisions when calculating the claimant’s
pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE):
(a) 23 January 2025 – $782.02;
(b) 6 February 2025 (internal review) – $1,652.12, and
(c) 27 February 2025 – $562.26.
claimant disputed the insurer’s decision of 27 February 2025 which
calculated his PAWE at $562.26.
claimant lodged with the insurer an application for internal review of the
insurer’s decision. The insurer declined to conduct
claimant subsequently lodged an application for merit review at the Personal
Injury Commission (the Commission). I have been asked
to deal with the
application as the merit reviewer.

UNDER REVIEW
decision under review is the insurer’s decision dated 27 February 2025
where the claimant’s pre-accident weekly earnings
(PAWE) was calculated at
$562.26. It is useful however to also briefly set out the findings of the
insurer’s internal review
decision dated 6 February
Internal review decision dated 6 February 2025
the initial decision of 23 January 2025 where the claimant’s PAWE was
calculated solely upon the 2024 tax return, the
insurer had a substantial amount
of primary material when making the internal review decision. By primary
material, I refer to the
Uber and Didi account summaries, bank account
statements and individual tax returns and notice of assessments for the tax
insurer decided against using the claimant’s tax documents as these
included periods outside the 12 months immediately before
the date of the
accident. The insurer also decided against using the Uber and Didi account
summaries, as these showed total income
for a given month and not the date on
which payment was made.
insurer used the bank statements and was satisfied that the claimant received a
gross income of $133,775 for the 12 months immediately
before the date of the
accident. Applying the merit review decision of
Ozcan v QBE Insurance
(Australia) Limited
the insurer
found GST is to be excluded from PAWE. As such, the claimant’s gross
income less 10% GST is $120,397.50.
a self-employed ride share driver, the insurer noted that business-related
expenses are to be deducted from the gross income. The
insurer was unable to
identify from the bank accounts which outgoing payments comprised of business
expenses. The insurer gave examples
of the multiple insurance payments and
attendances at service stations each month and whether they were for business
the insurer’s request, the claimant provided clarification of his expenses
as follows:
(a) petrol: $10,000;
(b) insurance: $2,400;
(c) car registration: $1,700;
(d) car maintenance: $6,000;
(e) car washes: $2,000;
(f) phone and internet: $1,200;
(g) tolls: $8,000; and
(h) car depreciation $3,187.50.
on the above, the insurer calculated the claimant’s expenses to total
$34,487.50.
claimant’s PAWE was calculated as $120,387.50 – $34,487.50 =
$85,910.00 / 52 weeks = $1,652.12 (as rounded).
Decision dated 27
February 2025 (decision under review)
insurer’s reasons provided for the decision under review are brief. The
insurer received a report from Procare dated 26
February 2025 which contained
the opinion of forensic accountant Mr Paul Croft.
insurer relied on the opinion of Mr Croft who recalculated the claimant’s
PAWE as follows:
Total gross income: $110,447.00
Total expenses: $81,209.00
Net earnings: $29,237.47
PAWE = $29,237.47 / 52 = $562.26.
will elaborate more on the report of Mr Croft below.
Preliminary
conferences were held with the parties on 10 June 2025 and 15 July 2025. The
central issue in dispute was the amount of
the claimant’s business
expenses that are to be deducted from the total income when calculating the
claimant’s PAWE.
claimant indicated that his total income for the financial year 2023-2024 was
. This figure excluded the
service fees and commission of 28% which were already deducted by rideshare
carriers Uber and Didi.
insurer relied on the calculations of Mr Croft, who found the claimant’s
total income to be $110,447 for the relevant
Mr Croft tallied the
claimant’s weekly Uber payouts for the period 20 November 2023 to 25
November 2024 and arrived at a figure
of $101,932. The amount of $2,905 was
deducted from this figure as this was payment received outside of the relevant
period. The
total came to $99,027 with the adjusted total less 10% GST being
the income from Didi, Mr Croft tallied the claimant’s monthly Didi bank
deposits for the period November 2023 to November
2024. This totalled $32,451
with the adjusted total less 10% GST being
is generally accepted that business expenses should be deducted from the
business income for the purposes of a PAWE
calculation.
This has been the
position held by previous merit reviewers and there is no issue raised by the
claimant’s position is that Service Fees and Commission from Uber and Didi
for the 2024 financial year are:
(a) Uber = $55,949.84 ($156,657.84 - $100,708); and
(b) Didi = $12,934.76 ($36,215.76 -
indicates that his remaining business expenses comprise of:
(a) GST total amount: $4,124;
(b) tax amount: $4,311;
(c) petrol: $10,000;
(d) insurance: $2,400;
(e) car registration: $1,700;
(f) car maintenance: $6,000;
(g) car washes: $2,000;
(h) phone and internet: $1,200, and
(i) tolls: $8,000.
claimant also purchased two vehicles for work purposes – a 2015 Lexus on
16 August 2023 for $14,000 and a 2018 Toyota Camry Hybrid on 20 June 2024
for $25,500.
claimant does not indicate what his PAWE should be. The claimant only says he
“did not agree” with the insurer’s
calculation of $604.38
gross per week in the reviewable
The claimant says the
calculation of $1,652.12 in the insurer’s internal review decision
“is much more reflective of
my income prior to the subject accident as it
took into account all of the records [he] had
the insurer’s perspective, in the claimant’s 2023 tax
Mr Croft noted that
there was a dissection of “other
Mr Croft was
able to determine the claimant’s variable expenses (comprising of
commission expense, fuel/oil and tolls) to be
$75,992. Mr Croft stated that
expressed as a percentage, financial year 2023 variable expenses are 49.2% of
total income.
claimant’s 2024 tax
did not, according to
Mr Croft, include a dissection of other expenses. Without a dissection of that
balance, he could not:
(a) estimate the ratio of FY24 variable expenses to total income; and
(b) confirm that FY24 “other expenses” have been calculated in a
manner consistent with FY23 and represent a complete
and accurate record of the
claimant’s expenses incurred in FY24.
Agreed matters
the preliminary conferences the following matters were agreed:
(a) the claimant is a self-employed earner;
the calculation of the claimant’s PAWE falls under schedule 1, clause
4(1) of the MAI Act which provides: “4(1) Pre-accident
weekly earnings, in
relation to an earner who is injured as a result of a motor accident, means the
weekly average of the gross earnings
received by the earner during the 12 months
immediately before the day on which the motor accident occurred...”;
(b) the relevant period for which the calculation of PAWE is based is from 22
November 2023 to 21 November 2024, and
(c) the claimant’s gross ride-share earnings are derived solely from his
own personal exertion and none from any alleged third
CONSIDERATION OF THE ISSUES
claimant’s gross earnings (excl GST) for the relevant period from Uber is
calculated in the amount of $90,025. This is based
on the weekly statements from
the gross earnings from Didi is calculated at $29,501 (excl GST) based on the
monthly statements from Didi.
findings are consistent with those found by Mr Croft. It is evident from Mr
Croft’s report that the amounts were verified
by reference to the
claimant’s provided CBA accounts.
do not accept the claimant’s figure of $123,989 as this is based upon his
2024 tax documentation which includes periods outside
the relevant period. The
information from his rideshare statements accurately sets out the
claimant’s gross earnings and his
bank account statements verify when the
payments were received.
combined gross earnings from Uber and Didi are therefore $119,526. This includes
the combined toll and airport fee reimbursements
in the amount of
claimant’s evidence comprises of an itemised list of the claimant’s
expenses and the amounts paid. No evidence in
support of the amounts were
were issued for the claimant to provide a concise record of his fixed and
variable expenses for the relevant period, with
the relevant evidence in support
of such amounts. The claimant did not comply with the directions, instead
indicating that the matter
be determined on the papers.
the absence of a concise record, the claimant’s tax information for FY23
and FY24, although covering periods outside of the
relevant period, is the best
primary source information before me and will be used for the calculation of the
claimant’s fixed
and variable expenses.
Croft estimated the claimant’s variable expenses by using the
claimant’s FY23 Notice of Assessment which showed total
FY23 variable
expenses comprising of commission, fuel and tolls to amount to $75,992.
Expressed as a percentage, FY23 variable expenses
were 49.2% of total income. Mr
Croft applied this percentage as being representative of the claimant’s
variable expenses for
do not accept Mr Croft’s calculation of the claimant’s variable
expenses by way of applying the previous financial year’s
total variable
expenses expressed as a percentage.
it is unfortunate that commission expenses are not listed in the “detailed
claimant’s individual tax return for FY24, such variable expenses are
documented in the FY23 Notice of Assessment (see
paragraph 44 above) to include
commission expenses, fuel and tolls.
note that commission payments are already excluded from the claimant’s
gross earnings as shown in the account summaries from
Uber and Didi covering the
relevant period.
way of example, I refer to the Uber Weekly Statement for the period 19 August
2024 to 26 August 2024. The claimant received fare
earnings of $2,880.63.
Following a deduction of $770 for an Uber “service fee”, the
claimant’s earnings were $2,146.79.
my view, to account for commission payments already deducted from the
claimant’s gross earnings would be inappropriate, as
it would serve to
levy the expense on the claimant twice and unfairly reduce his gross
and airport fees as mentioned above have already been reimbursed and accounted
for in the claimant’s gross earnings.
accept fuel and oil as listed in the FY24 Car Vehicle Expenses Worksheet as
variable expenses are therefore calculated as $15,694.
accept Mr Croft’s use of the FY23 information as being likely
representative of the claimant’s expenses with respect
to cleaning
($1,651) and mobile phone ($2,158).
accept the FY24 information as being representative of the claimant’s
expenses with respect to repair and maintenance ($2,154),
registration ($1,050)
and insurance ($1,650).
FY24 depreciation worksheet showed the total deduction for the decline in value
of the Lexus and Toyota Camry was $27,275.
fixed expenses are therefore calculated as $35,938.
CALCULATION
gross income = $119,526
Total expenses (fixed $35,938 + variable
$15,694) = $51,632
Gross earnings = $67,894
Period of calculation: 22 November 2023 to 21 November 2024 (52 weeks)
PAWE = $1,305.65.
insurer’s reviewable decision dated 27 February 2025 is set aside. For the
above reasons, I find that the claimant’s
PAWE is $1,306 (as
