REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 10 July 2023)
Introduction
[1] This is an
application by the appellant for reconsideration of a decision I made on 15 May
2023, as the Taxing Master, to allow
wholly items in the amended bill of costs
filed by respondent on 15 May 2023. By that decision I ordered the appellant to
respondent’s costs in the total sum of $214,079.31 comprised of
the following:
and disbursements taxed and allowed in the sum of $182,195.16
allowed in the sum of $18,219.51
fee in the sum of $13,664.64
Order for costs
[2] The taxation
of costs related to a decision of the Court of Appeal delivered on 27 June 2022
in which the appellant was ordered
to pay the respondent’s costs as
appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs of the proceedings before the
Local Court in File No 21934192 on the standard
basis, with those costs to be
agreed or taxed by the Local Court taxing officer in default of agreement.
appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal to the Supreme
Court in File No 2020-02980-SC on the indemnity
basis, with those costs to be
agreed or taxed by the Supreme Court taxing officer in default of
appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs of this appeal on the indemnity
basis, with those costs to be agreed or taxed
by the Supreme Court taxing
officer in default of agreement.
Application to
reconsider a taxation of costs decision
[3] Rule 63.55
Supreme Court Rules 1987
(the Rules) provides that:
(1) Where a Taxing Master decides to allow or disallow, wholly or in part, an
item in a bill or to allow some amount in respect of
an item, a party to the
taxation proceeding who objects to the decision may apply to have a Taxing
Master reconsider the decision.
(2) An application under subrule (1) shall be made by written notice to the
Taxing Master.
(3) The notice must be filed within 14 days after the date of the order on
taxation that contains the decision.
[4] The relevant
date for filing the written notice in this proceeding was 13 June 2023, given
that the order on taxation containing
the decision was made and distributed to
the parties on 30 May 2023.
[5] On 12 June
2023 at 11.32pm, the appellant wrote to the Civil Registry of the Court by email
stating that “I am writing to
submit an objection and appeal to the
Supreme Court Registrars’ orders regarding the Taxation hearing held on
May 2023” and provided a lengthy summation of her medical
issues in support of same.
[6] The Registry
Manager, Civil Registry of the Court wrote to the appellant by email on 13 June
2023 at 12.02pm, and advised her
of the requirements of rule 63.55 of the Rules,
which provide that:
(4) The applicant shall file with or subscribe to a notice under subrule (2) a
statement of his objections.
(5) A statement of objections referred to in subrule (4) shall specify, by a
list, the items as to which the applicant objects to
the decision of the Taxing
Master and shall state briefly but specifically the nature and grounds of each
[7] On 13 June
2023 at 1.22pm, the appellant wrote to the Civil Registry of the Court by email
and requested an extension of time
to file a statement of objections, citing
numerous medical conditions that allegedly made her unfit to prepare the
statement as required.
[8] The Registry
Manager, Civil Registry of the Court advised by return email at 2.16pm, on the
same date, that the appellant would
need to provide a medical certificate to
support her request for an extension of time. The appellant subsequently emailed
from Dr Satbir Aulakh of Top End Medical Centre, dated 5 December 2022,
which stated “[m]y patient Carollyn [sic] Reynolds
DOB 6/4/66 is suffering
from a brain injury and suffering from Malignant Hypertension. It is recommended
that she has a Therapy Dog
to help her cope with day to day affairs”.
[9] I considered
the request and did not grant the appellant an extension of time to file the
statement of objections. The medical
certificate provided by the appellant did
not cover the relevant dates, being from 30 May 2023 (when the parties were
provided with
the order on taxation containing the decision) to 13 June 2023
(when the notice and statement of objections were to be filed pursuant
63.55(4) with reference to rule 63.55(3) of the Rules).
[10] On 13 June
2023 at 1.51pm, the appellant emailed the Civil Registry of the Court. The email
was headed “Subject: Objection,
Reconsideration, and Review Request under
Section 63.55 of the Procedure on Taxation”. The Registry Manager, Civil
of the Court rejected this filing as a statement of objections because
it did not comply with rule 63.55(5) of the Rules. The appellant
was advised of
same via email on 13 June 2023 at 2.29pm.
[11] On 13 June
2023 at 3.04pm, the appellant emailed the Civil Registry of the Court. The email
was headed “Subject: Statement
of Objection – Taxation Law Order
63.55 Part 5”. Whilst not compliant with rule 63.55(5) of the Rules, it
was accepted
for filing as a statement of objections, and placed before me with
the written notice of objection, to reconsider the decision I
made on 15 May
Reconsideration of taxation decision
appellant has not complied with the requirements of rule 63.55(5) of the Rules.
The appellant has not specified, by a list,
the items as to which the appellant
objects to the decision of the Taxing Master and it follows that the appellant
has not specifically
stated the nature and grounds of any objection.
[13] By way of
her email, dated 13 June 2023 at 3.04pm, the appellant stated that she objects
to the decision on the following grounds:
unreasonableness, as it fails to consider my medical inability to respond, my
acquired frontal lobe brain injury and the
fact that I am a self-represented
litigant who was hospitalised on the day of the court proceedings”.
[14] Thereafter,
the appellant provides a summary of each of those grounds. The appellant does
not reference any specific item or
items in the bill of costs that I taxed in my
capacity as the Taxing Master.
[15] On 14 June
2023, the appellant provided a further email attaching two medical certificates
in support of her application for
reconsideration of the taxation of costs
decision. The first, prepared by Dr Satbir Aulakh of Top End Medical Centre is
dated 5 December
2022, and stated “[m]y patient Carollyn [sic] Reynolds
DOB 6/4/66 is suffering from a brain injury and suffering from Malignant
Hypertension. It is recommended that she has a Therapy Dog to help her cope with
day to day affairs”. The second, prepared
by Dr Pradeep Kelum Don of Top
End Medical Centre is dated 13 June 2023, and stated “Mrs Carolyn Jane
Reynolds has a medical
condition and is unfit for work from 13/06/2023 to
13/06/2023 inclusive”.
[16] Clearly,
neither medical certificate covers the date of the taxation of costs on 15 May
2023 nor the period to object to the
taxation of costs from 30 May 2023 (when
the parties were provided with the order on taxation containing the decision) to
2023 (when the notice and statement of objections were to be filed
pursuant to rule 63.55(4) with reference to rule 63.55(3) of the
completeness, I note that the appellant has not provided evidence of service of
the notice and statement of objections on
the respondent and the respondent has
not filed answers in writing to the objection filed by the appellant.
[18] Regardless,
I did not deem this evidence to be necessary for me to proceed to dismiss the
application for reconsideration of
the taxation of costs, because it does not
comply with rule 63.55 (4) and (5) of the Rules. The appellant has not
specified, by a
list, the items as to which the appellant objects to my decision
as the Taxing Master and it follows that the appellant has not specifically
stated the nature and grounds of any objection.
application by the appellant for reconsideration of a decision I made on 15 May
2023, as the Taxing Master, to allow wholly
items in the amended bill of costs
filed by respondent on 15 May 2023 is dismissed.
