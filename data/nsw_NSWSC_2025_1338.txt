Nature of the proceedings and background
Amended Statement of Claim (“ASC”) filed on 26 August 2025, the
Plaintiffs, Mr Darin, as liquidator of Portman Securities
Limited (in liq)
(“Company”), and the Company, seek relief against several
Defendants. Broadly, their claims arise from
the liquidator's and the Company's
challenge to a contract dated 26 March 2020 (“Contract”) by the
Company to purchase
a property situated at Punchbowl (“Property”),
which, it is alleged, was purchased at a substantial overvalue. The liquidator
and the Company contend that there was no realistic prospect that the Contract
could have gone to completion. The liquidator and
the Company bring claims
against the First Defendant, Mr Pamboris, for that transaction so far as it has
resulted in the Company’s
loss of a $5 million deposit and a potential
further liability to the Second Defendant (“Westwood”) and bring
against Westwood for an uncommercial transaction. Claims are also brought
against Mr Pamboris in respect of transactions with another
entity, Waldron
Projects Pty Ltd (“Waldron Projects”) of which Mr Pamboris was a
director, which appear to have some
connection with the transaction in respect
of the Property.
are also brought against the Third Defendant, Athenee Mortgages Pty Ltd
("Athenee"), relating to a purported advance of $5
million to Mr Pamboris.
Athenee was incorporated on 25 March 2025, and its director and sole shareholder
is Ms Susan Polias, who
is the wife (or, on Westwood’s case (Westwood
Amended Defence (“WAD”) [6B]), estranged wife) of Mr Gertos, the
director of Westwood, and a person who has been a director of several companies
with Mr Gertos.
Lay affidavit evidence
now turn to the lay affidavit evidence and cross-examination. In addressing that
evidence, I recognise that this hearing took place
not long after the events in
issue but I also have regard to the fallibility of human memory which increases
with the passage of
time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene:
Watson v Foxman
[1995] NSWCA 497
(1995) 49 NSWLR 315
at 318–319;
[2010] NSWSC 786
–[425]. I also have regard to the fact
that objective evidence, where available, is likely to be the most reliable
determining matters of credit that arise as to the affidavit evidence:
Armagas Ltd v Mundogas SA
[1861] LRSC 1
[1985] 1 Ll R 1
Re Colorado Products
Pty Ltd (in prov liq)
(2014) 101 ACSR 233
[2014] NSWSC 789
”). I also bear in mind the observations of Bell P
(as the Chief Justice then was, with whom Bathurst CJ agreed) in
ET-China.com
International Holdings Ltd v Cheung
(2021) 388 ALR 128
[2021] NSWCA 24
“Whilst the quality and accuracy of oral recollection of actual
conversations should be treated with care and caution given
the fallibility of
human memory (of which there has been a growing appreciation within the
judiciary in recent decades), oral testimony
may still be of value and
importance, as was recognised in the nuanced observations of Leggatt J
(as his Lordship then was) in
Gestmin SGPS SA v Credit Suisse
[2013] EWHC (Comm) 3560
“the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial of a commercial case
is, in my view, to place little if any reliance at
all on witnesses'
recollections of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base
factual findings on inferences drawn
from the documentary evidence and known or
probable facts.
This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful
– though its utility is often disproportionate to
its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which
cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny
to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a
, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular
conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid
the fallacy of
supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and
is honest, evidence based on that
recollection provides any reliable guide to
the truth.” [emphasis added]
Documents and events have to be understood in their context, and evidence
of context will often be furnished by witnesses in their
oral evidence.
Documents, moreover, will not always present a complete picture of events.
Indeed it would be rare that they do. Nor
do contemporaneous documents
necessarily or invariably convey or record the background
or context in which events took place. That
background or
context will be familiar to the actors at the
time of those events but may not always emerge
from documents.”
have here drawn on my summary of the applicable principles in, inter alia,
1derful Pty Ltd
[2024] NSWSC 1414
have also borne in mind the cautionary observations of Basten JA (Handley JA
agreeing) in
Sangha v Baxter

Firmtech Aluminium Pty Ltd v Xie;
Zhang v Xu; Xie v Auschn Conveyancing & Associates Pty Ltd
[2024] NSWSC
“Because a witness has not told the truth with respect to a particular
matter does not mean that other parts of his or her
evidence are untruthful.
Where possible, an assessment should be made of the reasons for the
untruthfulness in order to see if other
aspects of the evidence are likely to be
infected by the same concern. Further, evidence may be rejected because it is
unreliable, possibly mistaken or deliberately untruthful or capable
of being categorised in a variety of ways which are unlikely
to be capable of
clear delineation in some cases.
Further, findings of credibility are not usually findings with respect to
factual issues in the case, but are rather subsidiary findings
on the way to
determination of issues. Like many aspects of the evidence in a trial, the
evidence of a witness who is believed to
have lied in a particular respect, will
nevertheless be able to bear some weight and should be placed into a balance,
material evidence, before a conclusion is reached in relation to a
critical fact. The rejection of a witness in total, absent corroboration
likely to mean that, even where corroborated, little attention will be paid to
the evidence of the witness and less to the possible
consequences which might
flow from the fact that particular evidence is shown to be truthful: see
[2007] NSWCA 122
Plaintiffs read several affidavits of Christopher Darin, the Company’s
liquidator. By his first affidavit dated 5 June 2024,
Mr Darin outlined the
circumstances in which the Company was wound up and he was appointed as its
liquidator; the position in respect
of Mr Pamboris and Westwood; and the nature
of the Company’s business and its dealings with Westwood. He referred to
the circumstances
in which the Company initially received a substantial payment
by way of compensation from Transport for New South Wales (“TfNSW”)
for the acquisition of certain properties. Mr Darin also there referred to
public examinations of persons associated with the Company
and with Westwood, to
the Company’s financial records and to amounts paid to Waldron Projects.
Mr Darin also addresses past
business dealings between Mr Gertos and Mr Pamboris
and the matters relied on in the uncommercial transaction claim.
his second affidavit dated 20 February 2025, Mr Darin referred to the
Company’s financial statements, documents relating
to the acquisition of
the Property and matters relating to payments by the Company to Waldron
Projects. By a third affidavit dated
17 April 2025, Mr Darin referred to the
circumstances in which he became aware of the personal guarantee purportedly
given under
the Contract, which is deleted in the copies of the Contract held by
the Company but apparently retained in another version of the
Contract on which
Westwood relies. I return to that matter below.
a fourth affidavit dated 29 May 2025, Mr Darin referred to Mr Pamboris’
assets, including a property in Brown Street, Paddington
(“Paddington
Property”) and a property in Livingstone Road, Marrickville
(“Marrickville Property”); the circumstances
in which Mr Darin
became aware of Mr Pamboris’ dealings with Athenee in respect of those
properties; and the relationships
between Athenee, Mr Gertos and Ms Polias. He
also identified his then concern that Mr Pamboris’ grant of mortgages over
Paddington and Marrickville Properties in Athenee’s favour in May 2025
was intended to prevent the Plaintiffs’ recovery
of any judgment ordered
against Mr Pamboris in these proceedings. By his fifth affidavit dated 8 August
2025, Mr Darin further addressed
the position in respect of Mr Pamboris’
assets, the dealings in respect of the Paddington and Marrickville properties,
available information as to Athenee and the relationship between
Athenee and Mr Gertos.
Darin was cross-examined at some length, particularly by Mr Jordan, a solicitor,
who appears for Westwood in the proceedings. That
cross-examination did not
significantly advance the matters in issue, because Mr Darin did not have, and
did not purport to have,
personal knowledge of the matters in issue in the
proceedings, since he was appointed as the Company’s liquidator after
Plaintiffs also read the affidavit dated 11 April 2025 of Ms Pettit, a solicitor
acting for them in the proceedings, who referred
to Mr Gertos’ evidence
that Mr Pamboris had undertaken work for Westwood through another entity,
Waldron Hill Projects Pty
Ltd, and annexed a copy of a search of the records
maintained by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission relating to
that entity. I address Ms Pettitt’s further affidavit dated 5 November
2025 in dealing with the guarantee on which Westwood
relies below.
her affidavit dated 17 April 2025, Ms Funston, a solicitor acting for the
Plaintiffs in the proceedings, also addressed the position
in respect of the
Contract and dealt with the production of documents in response to orders for
production issued in connection with
liquidators’ examinations. By a
second affidavit dated 28 October 2025, Ms Funston addressed the production of
documents by
Mr Pamboris in response to a Notice to Produce dated 29 May 2025
issued to Mr Pamboris. By an affidavit dated 4 November 2025, Ms
solicitor acting for the Plaintiffs, gave evidence of service of the proceedings
upon the solicitors for Athenee, although
Athenee did not appear at the
Pamboris, although represented by a solicitor in respect of the proceedings,
read no evidence.
primarily relied on Mr Gertos’ affidavit dated 14 April 2025. Mr Gertos
gives evidence of a long commercial relationship
with Mr Pamboris, including
that Mr Pamboris was previously employed by Mr Gertos at the accounting practice
William J Gertos &
Co until approximately 2001 and continued to work as a
consultant for that practice after Mr Savell (who gives evidence for Westwood
the proceedings) purchased that practice in or about 2001. Mr Gertos’
evidence is that Mr Pamboris was also contracted to
undertake work for Westwood
on the development application for the Property and conducted that work through
one of his companies
and Westwood paid Waldron Projects for the work that was
being undertaken by Mr Pamboris (Gertos 14.4.25 [7]–[8]). That evidence
does not undermine the Company’s claim for the payments made by the
Company to Waldron Projects.
Gertos’ evidence is also that the Company entered into an agreement to
purchase a property at Annandale on 28 June 2016 for
$68 million (which may be
the property referred to in Mr Savell’s evidence) and that completion of
that contract was frustrated
by compulsory acquisition of that property by
TfNSW. Mr Gertos also refers to a conversation with a person in Cyprus, whose
he does not recall, who said he worked for a large financial institution,
the name of which is not identified, which would provide
“most of the
funds” for the Company’s acquisition of the Annandale property.
Plainly, the gaps in that evidence
undermine its weight; but, even apart from
that matter, the willingness of an individual associated with a financial
institution
in Cyprus to fund an acquisition of the Annandale property says
nothing as to his willingness to fund an acquisition of a Property
at well above
its market value by a company that then had no substantial assets or income. Mr
Gertos also refers to a conversation
with Mr Smith of Westpac to “verify
the conversation” but gives no evidence of anything said by Mr Smith that
Gertos’ evidence (Gertos 14.4.25 [15]) is that he was satisfied, after
that conversation, the Company would be able to complete
the purchase of the
Annandale property and that overseas interests would be able to provide most of
the capital, with the balance
being provided by Westpac or some other Australian
lender. I do not accept the conversations set out by Mr Gertos provided any
for that satisfaction but, even if they did, that would not advance the
position as to the Company’s ability to fund the purchase
of the Property
at substantial overvalue. In cross-examination, Mr Gertos claimed that they
were further conversations, at least
with Mr Smith, in relation to the Property,
but that claim does not advance Westwood’s position where those
conversations were
not in evidence and would have been inadmissible hearsay
where Mr Smith did not give evidence.
Gertos’ evidence is that Westwood initially indicated to Mr Pamboris that
it wanted $145 million for the Property, which
would have been an even more
remarkable overvaluation of that property. Mr Gertos’ evidence is that Mr
Pamboris then indicated
that an overseas contact would be providing the relevant
sourcing the funds (Gertos 14.4.25 [19]). Mr Gertos refers to a lesser offer
then made by Mr Pamboris and to subsequent negotiations which resulted in a
price of $100 million. Mr Gertos’ evidence is (Gertos
“I was satisfied that Pamboris and his partners would be able to afford
the purchase price based on the previous discussions
I had with Graham Smith
from Westpac, Pamboris himself, and Pamboris equity partner from Cyprus.”
do not accept that evidence, and do not accept that the previous conversations
provided any rational basis for being satisfied that
Mr Pamboris’
“equity partner”, still less the Company, would be able to afford
the purchase price of $100 million
in order to purchase a property at
substantially more than its market value. Mr Gertos also refers to an extension
of time for the
Company pay the balance of the deposit allowed by Westwood on 8
June 2020, until 30 June 2020; the termination of the Contract by
Westwood on 8
October 2020; Westwood’s subsequent purchase of the Property, which did
not take place until 30 August 2021;
and subsequent developments in respect of
the rezoning of the Property.
Golledge, with whom Ms Bailey appears for the Plaintiffs, submits
“Mr Gertos’ evidence was, in many respects unsatisfactory when
compared with contemporaneous documents and with evidence
he has given in
writing both in previous legal proceedings and at his public examination in
2022: see for instance Exhibit P3 (T79:27-80:43),
T132:20, T138:49-139:8,
CB.2.2435 Lines 24:35). The submission is that Mr Gertos’ evidence on
matters of importance in the
case ought not be accepted unless it is otherwise
corroborated including by undisputed contemporaneous documents.”
Gertos was cross-examined and was generally not prepared to respond to questions
in direct way and preferred to give speeches that
he thought would advance
Westwood’s interests. Mr Gertos’ evidence in cross-examination was
replete with consistent claims
that he did not recall matters, including
relatively recent matters, other than several matters which would assist
position which he recalled with precision. I have no doubt that
Mr Gertos’ claimed recollection or lack of recollection reflected
perception as to matters which would or would not advance Westwood’s
Gertos has also given several radically inconsistent accounts of events. I have
referred above to his evidence, in these proceedings,
as to a telephone call
with one of Mr Pambouris’ “equity partners” in 2016 relating
to the purchase of the Annandale
property. However, in an affidavit dated 16
June 2020 sworn in proceedings in the Land and Environment Court of New South
P3), Mr Gertos had given evidence of discussions with Mr Pamboris,
also relating to the purchase of the Annandale property, in which
Mr Pamboris
had told him that he had established contacts with “substantial money in
Cyprus” in 2015, but refused to
advise the identity of the funder, and
that Mr Pamboris then said that:
“I cannot divulge their identity. The people involved are a very
conservative and private family. They would sever their ties
with me if they
found out that I was divulging their name. ...”
Mr Gertos’ account of that conversation, he was also then told that Mr
Pamboris’ nephew operated a chain of hotels
in Crete, that the nephew had
introduced Mr Pamboris to the Cypriot family who had funded the nephew’s
hotel business and asset
purchases, and had agreed to support Mr Pamboris’
acquiring commercial property in Sydney.
Gertos gave a further account of his knowledge of the funding obtained by Mr
Pamboris and the Company for the purchase of the Property
in the course of the
liquidator’s examination on 26 August 2022. Mr Gertos’ evidence,
again entirely inconsistent with
the evidence he led at this hearing, was there
that he knew “nothing” as to the identity of Mr Pamboris’
he had never asked about the identity of those investors and that
“[w]hen you sell something, you shut up. Never talk beyond
sale”. That evidence was inconsistent both with the evidence that he had
given in the Land and Environment Court, that
he had asked as to the identity of
those investors and Mr Pamboris had refused to tell him; and with the evidence
he gave in these
proceedings, that he had in fact had a conversation with the
lead investor.
three accounts are irreconcilable. In Mr Gertos’ 2020 version, he did not
know the identity of the funder from Cyprus,
although he knew it was a Cypriot
family, because Mr Pamboris would not tell him, and he did not refer to any
conversation with that
funder, which would necessarily have disclosed the
funder’s identity. In Mr Gertos version at this hearing, he had a
conversation
with that funder, set out in relatively precise terms, although it
had occurred several years ago; he knew the identity of the funder
cross-examination, he went further to suggest that he recalled the name of the
funder and, for the first time, offered that
name; and the funder was not a
Cypriot family but an employee of a Cypriot bank with access to funding from
that bank. Having regard
to the inconsistencies between these accounts, and my
observations of Mr Gertos in the witness box, I am comfortably satisfied (to
standard required by
Evidence Act
Evidence Act
”)) that his evidence as to these matters was
not only false, but was deliberately false and I am comfortably satisfied that,
notwithstanding the observations in
Sangha v Baxter
, I should not give
any weight to Mr Gertos’ evidence of this matter or generally, unless
corroborated by third party documentary
read the affidavit dated 28 March 2025 of Mr Savell, an accountant who provides
services to Westwood. Mr Savell there referred
(in paragraphs 17 and 18) to a
conversation with Mr Smith, who he said was a senior banker at Westpac,
concerning possible funding
for Mr Pamboris’ purchase of properties at
Camperdown from Westwood, which appear to be a reference to the Annandale
that is addressed in Mr Gertos’ evidence. Those paragraphs were
plainly hearsay in nature; they were admitted with a limiting
order under
Evidence Act
as evidence of the conversations and not as proof of
the relevant facts; and they do not advance matters, in any event, because (even
if it admitted to prove the fact) the suggestion that Westpac would
“consider” the purchase of the Annandale property
provides no
rational basis for a finding that Westpac would be prepared to fund a purchase
of a different property at Punchbowl for
development, at a price of $100 million
which was more than twice then then market value of that property, by a company
no substantial assets. I will address Mr Savell’s evidence as to
the execution of the Contract and the inclusion of a guarantee
in it below. Mr
Savell was in ill-health, was not available for cross-examination and was not
cross-examined.
also reads an affidavit dated 25 June 2025 of Mr Vaggis, a real estate agent,
who refers to discussions with an investor
from Hong Kong who expressed interest
in the Property. His evidence of those discussions was plainly hearsay and was
admitted with
a limiting order under
Evidence Act
evidence of the conversation and not evidence of the truth of the asserted facts
and that evidence does not advance any issue
as to the valuation of the
agency agreement which was annexed to Mr Vaggis’ affidavit (Ex J1, 3952)
was replete with errors, which are, at best, surprising
in an agency agreement
relating to a sale of a property purportedly valued at $100 million, which would
generate commission for Mr
Vaggis’ firm between $750,000 and $1 million.
There is reference to an “ABC” for Westwood, possibly intended to
a reference to an Australian business number or an Australian company number,
but the number referred to does not related to Westwood.
The relevant property
is identified “as Per Contract” but the relevant contract is not
identified; the “agent’s
opinion” of the estimated market
price is said to be $100 million; and the price to be “offered” is
also $100 million,
although Mr Vaggis repeatedly denied that he had any
instructions from Mr Gertos as to the offer price; the commission calculation
turn records alternative prices of $75 million or $100 million, leading to
commission of $750,000 or $1 million at a commission
rate of one percent. The
agreement is recorded as commencing on 10 October 2020 but a handwritten note
that “This agreement
is valid until December 31st 2019”. In
cross-examination, Mr Vaggis suggested that these figures were reversed, so that
agreement commenced on 31 December 2019 and was valid until 10 October 2020;
however, he did not explain how he, in a handwritten
statement of the date to
which the agreement was valid, could have made so substantial an error.
Vaggis also annexes a purported letter of offer from a large Chinese property
company to acquire the Punchbowl property for a price
of $75 million,
purportedly valid for two weeks expiring on 3 December 2019; however, that
agreement, as purportedly executed by
the Executive Director Acquisitions of
that company, misspells its own name. Again, little turns upon that error, where
accepted that the suggested discussion with that investor was subject
to an extended due diligence period and the suggested “offer”
not in a form that could be accepted.
Golledge submits, and I accept, that:
“The evidence of Mr Vaggis, even if accepted by the Court (and there is
good reason for the Court to consider carefully the
weight of any such evidence,
noting for example Mr Vaggis’ lack of ability to recall particular matters
(see for instance T152:42-153:1)
and the vagaries of his evidence regarding the
offer from “Evergrand” (T160:49-163:41), does not assist
case or detract from that of the [P]laintiffs.”
Expert evidence
Plaintiffs also tender the report (Ex P5) of Mr Geoff Green, who is a principal
at Harborside Advisory Pty Ltd, who has extensive
credit risk experience with
bank lenders and extensive debt advisory experience for private businesses. He
recognises, as the Company’s
financial statements indicate, that the
Company did not have an income stream and did not have tangible assets capable
of providing
collateral for a loan. He expresses the view that the Company may
have been able to secure deposit funding from private lenders,
but would have
required it to arrange real estate security with a value of at least $8.5
million in order to do so, since the payment
of the two deposit instalments
would not create an asset that lenders would regard as providing real estate
security. He also expresses
the view that the available information indicated
that the Company would not have been able to arrange real estate security with
that value, even if Mr Pamboris had provided a guarantee and granted mortgages
over his personal assets. I accept Mr Green’s
evidence as to that matter;
but, even if I had not done so, it would still have been apparent there would
have been no advantage
to the Company in raising funds to pay the deposits,
where it had no realistic capacity of raising funds to pay the balance of the
amount due under the Contract to purchase the Property and no realistic prospect
of profiting from an onsale of that property to
a third party, where it was
contracting to purchase the Property at a substantial over-value.
Golledge submits, and I accept, that:
“Mr Green’s evidence concerning the likelihood of Lenders (whether
first, second or third tier) being willing to provide
funding to enable the
Company to meet the obligation to pay the balance of the Deposit under the
Contract due at the end of June
[220], and as to the terms which would apply to
any finance that would be provided if offers could be obtained at all, ought be
He was an impressive expert witness. Both his report and his oral
evidence were appropriately restrained and, in the witness box,
he avoided any
dogmatic rejection of propositions put to him in cross examination by Mr Jordan
– though none of those “concessions”
(if that’s what
they were) diminished, in any significant way, Mr Green’s opinion that
finance was unlikely and, if available,
it would be on terms which, based on
other evidence in the case, the Court can safely conclude the Company would be
unable to meet.”
parties led valuation evidence as to the value of the Property at the Contract
date. The Plaintiffs tender a report dated 21
March 2025 of Mr Peter McSwiggan
(Ex P6), who is a director at Preston Rowe Paterson Sydney Pty Ltd. Mr McSwiggan
adopted two alternative
approaches, by reference to scenario 1 which reflected
existing planning controls on 26 March 2020 and scenario 2 which reflected
proposed zoning and planning controls, which derived a higher value for the
Property than scenario 1. He expressed the view that
the Property had a
retrospective market value, as at 26 March 2020, exclusive of GST, in the order
of $38 million, which reflected
a mid-point between those scenarios, on the
basis that a vendor and purchaser share the benefit and risk attached to those
It seems to me that that valuation likely exceeded the then market
value of the property, to the extent that he took into account
a position in
scenario 2 which did not then exist.
tendered the expert report of Mr (Constantine) Dean Galanos of Property Logic
Valuers. By letter dated 9 April 2025 (Ex D1,
372), the solicitors for Westwood
had instructed Mr Galanos’ firm the basis on which the valuation was to be
undertaken as
“We request that you prepare an Expert Valuation Report which opines as
(a) the value of the Property as at 26 March 2020,
acknowledging the highest and best use of the land as a redevelopment site,
and otherwise assuming satisfactory completion of the 2018 Gateway
Determination
Galanos’ report made clear that, consistent with that instruction, he had
valued the property by reference to its highest
and best use as a redevelopment
in accordance with the “gateway proposal/determination”, although he
was also instructed
that the gateway determination was cancelled in March 2021,
and his inquiries confirmed that to be the case. I recognise that there
necessary inconsistency between the assumption that he was asked to make and
facts which were known to him, since the gateway
proposal did not cease to have
effect until after the valuation date to which his report was directed. On that
basis, he valued the
property at the somewhat higher figure of $50,450,000 as a
retrospective market value as at 26 March 2020. Little turns on the difference
between that value and the valuation prepared by Mr McSwiggan, where Mr
Galanos’ valuation itself indicates that the Company
contracted to acquire
the property at nearly double its market value.
Golledge submits that:
“both [of the valuers] arrived at roughly the same conclusion as to the
value of the Property at 26 March 2020 if that valuation
was based upon the
“fiction” that the Gateway Determination had been approved and that
subsequent local government planning
and development controls had been amended
in accordance with that Determination...Mr McSwiggen’s opinion that an
actual purchaser
would apply some level of discount to his initial figure on
account of uncertainty as to the fate of those matters ought be accepted.
Galanos, whose instructions were, somewhat peculiarly, confined to carrying out
a valuation on the basis of the planning fiction
described above, accepted in
cross examination that whilst that was a possibility the extent of any discount
or allowance was difficult
to calculate as it would depend upon various
circumstances. ... In any event, for the purposes of the case, it is sufficient
that even when calculated on the basis of the “planning
fiction” - being the approach most favourable to the Defendants,
expert evidence from both valuers supports the Plaintiffs’ case that the
market value of the Property was about $50 million
below that which Mr Pamboris
caused the Company to agree.”
I have noted above, there is little difference between the valuers so far as
each of them value the Property in the order of about
$50 million, if the
gateway determination or other similar planning proposals had taken effect. As I
also noted above, Mr McSwiggan
also addresses the position if the gateway
proposal had not taken effect, which is not addressed by Mr Galanos. The
common view is that the Property had, at best, a value of about
half of the amount which the Company had contracted to pay for it
Contract. For completeness, the valuers also addressed, in additional oral
evidence by leave, the possible impact of specific
terms of the Contract under
which Westwood had acquired the Property from the Croatian Club Ltd
(“Club”) (Ex J1, 1047),
including the Club’s rights under cl
15-17 to an option to acquire the Club Premises and Additional Area (as
defined), its
entitlement to a lease on specified terms, and the obligations
imposed upon Westwood as to completion of the development within a
time, in potentially further depreciating the value of the Property. It is not
necessary to address that question, or the
question whether the Company would
have been bound by those obligations had it acquired the Property from Westwood,
where the Contract
price substantially exceeds the value of the Property, even
apart from those obligations.
also tendered a report dated 29 April 2025 of Mr Gheorghui, a town planner,
relating to the Property. It is not apparent
that this report significantly
advances any issue in the proceedings, where it is plain enough that the
Contract to acquire the Property
was at a substantial overvalue and the Company
could not afford to pay the deposit for it, still less the balance that was due;
it had no prospect, on the evidence, of funding the development so as to
obtain any benefit from that development or recouping any
amount overpaid to
acquire the Property if (contrary to the fact) it ever had any realistic
prospect of acquiring the Property.
Background facts to the
claims in respect of the Property
Plaintiffs bring several claims in respect of the Property. First, they seek an
order that Mr Pamboris pay to the Company damages
and/or compensation under
Corporations Act
in the amount of $3,225,297.01 (as amended in closing submissions). Second, the
Plaintiffs seek an order under
s 588FF(1)(a)
directing Mr
Pamboris to pay to the Company the sum of $5,000,000. Third, the Plaintiffs seek
an order in respect of that amount against
Westwood and also seek an order under
s 588FF(1)(e)
releasing and discharging any debt owed by the
Company to Westwood in respect of the unpaid portion of the deposit under the
Golledge describes this claim in submissions as directed to:
“the entry by the Company into [the Contract] for the purchase of a
property at Punchbowl from [Westwood] for a price of $100
circumstances where the Company had no realistic prospect of completing the
Contract and, as a result, when the Company
inevitably defaulted and the
Contract was terminated, the Company lost the benefit of a $5 million deposit
which it had paid and
incurred a liability for payment of the remaining $5
million of the deposit sum.”
Jordan, who as I noted above appears for Westwood, emphasises, and I have regard
to, aspects of Westwood’s dealings with
the Property. On 24 December 2014,
Westwood entered into a Call Option Deed with the Club providing for Westwood to
purchase the
Property for $26,000,000, which was subsequently amended by deeds
executed on 19 May 2017 and 24 July 2018. It seems likely that,
as Mr Jordan
submits, that allowed Westwood to acquire the property at a lower price when it
ultimately did so, well after it had
purportedly entered the Contract it sell it
to the Company and then terminated that Contract.
July 2017, Westwood submitted a planning proposal seeking to rezone the Property
and increase development controls. They sought
to rezone the whole of the
Property to "B1 Local Centre" with an improved Floor Space Ratio ("FSR") control
of 1.7:1 (Gheorghui 29.4.25
[43]). That proposal was not approved. On 25 May
2018, a Gateway Determination granted by the then Minister for Planning,
conditional
upon Council's finalisation of requisite legislative amendments
within nine months, which did not occur.
is common ground that the Company was incorporated on 3 June 2016 and Mr
Pamboris was its sole director (ASC [5], substantially
admitted by Mr
Pamboris’ Defence filed 11 November 2024 (“PD”) [5], admitted
WAD [5]; Ex J1, 2634). It is common
ground that, in the same month, the Company
entered a contract to purchase the Annandale property. It may be unlikely that
the Company
could have funded that purchase, and I have referred to evidence
touching upon that question (and admitted on a limited basis) above.
ultimately not required to do so, since TfNSW compulsorily acquired the Property
and that contract did not complete. On 13
August 2018 the Company received
$8,033,663.31 as compensation from TfNSW, although it did not then own that
next day, on 14 August 2018, the Company transferred $8 million into a trust
account of solicitors as the deposit on the Company’s
proposed purchase of
part of the Property for $80 million by way of an option deed. That purchase did
not proceed and, on 21 September
2018, Mr Pamboris requested the return of that
amount, which was paid on 23 September 2018.
Pamboris then caused the Company to pay over $3 million from the Company to
Waldron Projects over an 18 month period (Ex J1, 3343,
3517ff; ASC [20],
admitted PD [20]). I address a further claim arising from those payments below.
19 December 2019, a further development application for the construction of
purpose-built registered club premises over the southern
part of the Property
was submitted and later refused on 16 December 2020.
27 December 2019, Westwood entered into a contract to purchase the Property from
the Club for $26,000,000.00, with an extended
settlement date. The contract
contained the clauses relating to the development of club premises, to which I
have referred above,
and a charge securing Westwood’s performance of those
obligations. Westwood submits that those contractual obligations did
prohibit nor preclude Westwood from settling the subsequent contract with the
Company and that Westwood could have assigned its
rights and interests under the
Contract to the Company. The Plaintiffs did not contend to the contrary and I
need not and do not
decide that question.
or about 26 March 2020, the Company entered into the Contract with Westwood to
purchase the Property from Westwood for $100,000,000.
It was a term of the
Contract that the Company was liable to pay the deposit to Westwood, in the
amount $100 on the date of the Contract;
$5,000,000 on or before 31 March 2020;
and $4,999,900 on or before 30 June 2020 or termination of the Contract by
Westwood (ASC [7]–[8],
substantially admitted in PD [7]–[8];
substantially admitted WAD [8]; special condition 14 of the Contract). The times
payment of the deposit were essential (ASC [9]; substantially admitted PD
[9]; admitted WAD [9]; special condition 14(d) of the Contract).
It was also a
term of the Contract that, if the Company did not comply with the Contract in an
essential respect, Westwood could
terminate the Contract and keep or recover the
deposit and that the deposit would be released unconditionally to Westwood
immediately
upon the payment of each instalment and without requiring the
Company’s express consent (ASC [10]–[11]; substantially
admitted PD
[10]–[11]; admitted WAD [10]–[11]; cl 9.1 and special condition 10
of the Contract).
or about 25 March 2020, the Company paid the sum of $5,000,000 to Westwood (ASC
[12], admitted PD [12], admitted WAD [12]). On
or about 26 March 2020, the
Company paid the sum of $100 to Westwood (ASC [13], substantially admitted PD
[13], admitted WAD [13]).
By entering into the Contract, the Company became
indebted to Westwood in the amount of $4,999,900 being the balance of the
owing pursuant to the Contract, payable by 30 June 2020 (ASC [14],
substantially admitted PD [14], admitted WAD [14]). The entry
into the Contract
also exposed the Company to a significant liability for stamp duty, of
$5,483,055 (Ex P5, [9.9]), which was due
and payable about the same time.
written agreement dated 19 June 2020 between the Company and Westwood, the date
to pay the balance of the deposit in the amount
of $4,999,900 was extended to 30
September 2020 (ASC [15], admitted PD [15], admitted WAD [15]).
8 October 2020, Westwood terminated the Contract for the Company’s breach
of the requirement that the Company pay the balance
of the deposit by 30
September 2020 (ASC [16], substantially admitted PD [16], admitted WAD [16]).
10 August 2021, Westwood and the Club executed a Deed of Variation to their
contract for sale of the Property and Westwood then
settled the purchase of the
Property from the Club in August 2021 and only then became the registered
proprietor of the Property.
I need not address subsequent steps in relation to
the potential development of the Property, which do not affect any issue which
have to determine.
Claim for breach of director’s duties by
Mr Pamboris in respect of the Property
Plaintiffs plead (ASC [25]) general law, equitable and statutory duties of care
owed by Mr Pamboris to the Company, including
his duties under
. The Plaintiffs seek an order that Mr Pamboris pay damages
and/or compensation under
to the Company in the
amount of $13,225,297.01 (as amended in closing submissions). I will first
address the applicable principles.
requires a director or other officer of a corporation to
exercise their powers and discharge their duties with the degree of care
diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or
officer of a corporation in the corporation’s
circumstances and occupied
the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within the corporation as,
the director or officer.
The statutory duty of care and diligence under that
section overlaps with directors’ duty of care arising at general law. I
summarised the applicable principles in
at [408] as follows:
Australian Securities Commission v Gallagher
52–3, Pidgeon J observed that the test whether the statutory duty of care
and diligence had been contravened was an
objective one, that a director need
not exhibit a greater degree of skill in the performance of his or her duties
than may reasonably
be expected for a person of his or her knowledge and
experience, in the relevant circumstances, and that it was relevant to consider
the way in which the work of the company was distributed between its directors
and other officers, provided that distribution was
reasonable. In
Securities and Investments Commission v Adler
above at [372] (upheld by the
Court of Appeal in
Adler v Australian Securities and Investments
(2003) 46 ACSR 504
[2003] NSWCA 131)
, Santow J noted
that the duties imposed by the section are essentially the same as
directors’ duties at general law; that,
in determining whether a director
had exercised reasonable care and diligence, the test was what an ordinary
person, with the director’s
knowledge and experience, might be expected to
have done in the circumstances if he or she was acting on his or her own behalf;
that the duty of care and diligence would require special vigilance in a
situation of potential conflict, requiring scrupulous concern
on the part of
those officers who become aware of that transaction to ensure that any necessary
corporate approvals are obtained
and safeguards put in place. That decision has
been cited with approval in recent case law, including
Parker v Tucker
(2010) 77 ACSR 525
[2010] FCA 263
per Gordon J and
Diamond Hill
Mining Pty Ltd v Huang Jim Mining Pty Ltd
(2011) 84 ACSR 616
[2011] VSC 288
per Croft J.”
question whether this duty is breached can only be answered by balancing the
foreseeable risk of harm against the potential benefits
that could reasonably
have been expected to accrue to the company from the conduct in question:

Alora Davies
(from which I have drawn the
summary that appears above).
requires a director or officer of a corporation to
exercise his or her powers and discharge his or her duties in good faith in the
best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose. I summarised the
relevant principles in respect of that section and the
broadly corresponding
general law duty in
at [419]–[421] as
(1991) 4 WAR 21
at 499, Malcolm CJ
summarised the requirements of that duty as being that directors (1) must
exercise their powers in the interests
of the company, and must not misuse or
abuse their power; (2) must avoid conflict between their personal interests and
those of the
company; (3) must not take advantage of their position to make
secret profits; and (4) must not misappropriate the company’s
themselves.
The case law is divided as to whether a contravention of
s 181(1)(a)
Corporations Act
requires that it be established that a director engaged
deliberately in conduct which he or she knew was not in the company’s
interests: for example,
Forge v Australian Securities and Investments
(2004) 213 ALR 574
[2004] NSWCA 448at
[245] per McColl JA (with
whom Handley and Santow JJA agreed);
Holyoake Industries (Vic) Pty Ltd v
V-Flow Pty Ltd
above at [150], varied on appeal on another point in
V-Flow Pty Ltd v Holyoake Industries (Vic) Pty Ltd
Banking Corporation v Bell Group Ltd (in liq) (No 3)
(2012) 44 WAR 1
[2012] WASCA 157
, the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western
Australia unanimously held that the corresponding general law duty to act in
good faith in the company’s best interests was subjective and would be
complied with if directors honestly believed they acted
in the company’s
best interests (at [923] per Lee AJA, at [1988] per Drummond AJA, at [2027],
[2772], [2795] per Carr AJA).
The alternative view is that a contravention of
that limb of
can be established if the law objectively considers that what
the director did was improper, even if the director subjectively believed
he or she was acting in the company’s best interests: see, for example,
Australian Growth Resources Corporation Pty Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) v Van
(1988) 13 ACLR 261at
per King CJ;
Developments Pty Ltd (in liq) v Alamanda Property Investments No 2 Pty Ltd
(formerly known as Dollarforce Financial Services
(2011) 86 ACSR
[2011] VSCA 392
–[33]. The difference in those approaches does
not seem to me to be material for the purposes of this case. The section may
contravened if a director promotes his or her personal interest in a situation
where there is a conflict or real or substantial
possibility of a conflict
between those interests and the company’s interests:
Securities and Investments Commission v Adler
above at [735];
above at [72].
A contravention of
s 181(1)(b)
may also be established if a director does not
exercise his or her powers for the purpose for which they were conferred or
them for an improper purpose, and the bulk of authority indicates that
question is to be determined objectively:
Permanent Building Society (in liq)
(1994) 11 WAR 187
14 ACSR 109at
137 per Ipp J (with whom Malcolm
CJ and Seaman J agreed);
Australian Securities and Investments Commission v
above at [738]–[739];
above at [73]. In
Banking Corporation v Bell Group Ltd (in liq) (No 3)
above, the majority
held that whether a director acts for an improper purpose, for the purposes of
the corresponding general law
duty, is determined objectively involving an
assessment by the Court of what was reasonable in the circumstances (at [933]
AJA, at [1988], [2027], [2073] per Drummond AJA). By contrast, Carr AJA
held that the test whether directors had acted for an improper
purpose was
primarily subjective, although a decision would be voidable if directors acted
in good faith for a purpose that was beyond
their powers or for a collateral
purpose (at [2923]).”
Special Gold Pty Ltd (in liq) v Dyldam Developments Pty Ltd (subject to DOCA)
[2025] FCA 825
, Jackman J held that several directors had breached,
inter alia,
in respect of the dissipation of the sale
proceeds of a property, where payments had been made in apparent breach of a
freezing order,
without corporate benefit and in a manner that left the company
unable to pay its debts and tax liabilities. His Honour there noted
the lack of utility in distinguishing between a subjective and objective
criterion in respect of breach of the duty of
good faith in
and undertook a detailed review (at [78]ff) of the matters relevant
to determining whether a director’s conduct was in good
faith, concluding
that that standard required that a director act in accordance with what he or
she honestly and reasonably believed
to be the company’s best interests.
Nothing turns on the subtleties of that standard here.
Plaintiffs plead (ASC [26]–[27], denied PD [26]–[27]) that Mr
Pamboris breached his general law and statutory duty
of care in causing the
Company to enter into the Contract and that:
“A reasonable person in the position of [Mr] Pamboris as a director of the
Company would not have caused the Company to enter
into the Contract for Sale in
circumstances where there was no reasonable basis for believing that the
[C]ompany would be able to
pay the balance of the deposit.”
Plaintiffs also plead (ASC [28]–[29], denied PD [28]–[29]) that Mr
Pamboris breached his general law and statutory
duty of good faith in causing
the Company to enter into the Contract and that:
“Entry into the Contract for Sale was not in the best interests of the
Company in circumstances where there was no reasonable
basis for believing that
the Company would be able to pay the balance of the deposit.”
Plaintiffs in turn plead (ASC [37]–[39], denied PD [37]–[39]) that,
had Mr Pamboris acted in accordance with his duty
of care or his duty of good
faith, the Company would not have entered into the Contract and, by reason of
his breach of those duties,
the Company has suffered loss and damage. That loss
is particularised as the deposit paid to Westwood and forfeited on termination
of the contract, being $5,000,000 and the balance of the deposit, being
$5,000,000, for which the Company is liable to Westwood.
Plaintiffs also plead (ASC [43], denied PD [43]) that Mr Pamboris is liable to
pay damages or compensation under
to the Company for
loss and damage suffered as a result of his breaches of the duty of care and/or
duty of good faith, relevantly
in respect of the Contract. That section allows
the Court to order a person to compensate a corporation for damage suffered by
if that person has contravened a civil penalty provision in relation to the
corporation and the damage resulted from the contravention.
The relief available
to the Company under
for a breach of a civil penalty
provision includes the profit made by a third party, relevantly, Westwood, by
that breach: V

(2021) 150 ACSR 146
[2021] NSWSC 40
Golledge submits that:
“Any benefit or advantage to the Company by securing, upon entry into the
Contract, the possibility of acquiring title to the
Property was entirely
illusory given that the Company did not have and had not secured (by anything
like an offer from a reliable
source) sufficient funding to pay even the full
deposit let alone the $90 million balance of the purchase price. Default under,
termination of, the Contract, before that payment had to be made, was not
only plainly possible, it was likely inevitable when one
considers the position
of the Company and its prospects in March 2020. Moreover, even if the Company
somehow obtained finance to,
and did actually, complete the Contract, there is
no evidence that the value of the Property on settlement or in the imminent or
foreseeable future thereafter justified the price which had been agreed, namely
$100 million, in circumstances where it had been
purchased by Westwood, under a
contract with an extended settlement date for a quarter of that price only
months before. Obtaining
title would have come at a price that could not be
justified at the time and, even with the benefit of hindsight, can only be
as foolhardy. That submission is supported by the expert valuation
evidence led by both parties in this case. Again, that Mr Pamboris
not to go into evidence and expose his thinking process, any due diligence he
undertook and from whom, or the flaw, generally,
[Plaintiffs’’] case theory renders those conclusions all the more
compelling.”
Akinyemi, who appears for Mr Pamboris, submits that:
“at the time the Company entered into the Contract for Sale, 26 March
(a) the Company had sufficient funds to pay the first two
instalments of the deposit, and that Mr Pamboris, having provided the
had net assets worth more than the value of the balance of the deposit;
(b) it was not foreseeable that the Covid-19 pandemic would
halt investment in property projects.”
Mr Akinyemi submits, on that basis, that the entry into the Contract was not
unreasonable or in breach of duty.
first aspect of this submission is not supported by the evidence since, at the
time the Company entered the Contract, it did not
have sufficient funds to pay
either the balance of the deposit due on 30 June 2020 or stamp duty payable at
any committed funding for those payments. Mr
Akinyemi’s submission that Mr Pamboris could have provided financial
the Company implicitly relies, in that respect, on a statement of
assets dated 7 November 2018 which was apparently prepared by Mr
although it is not signed by him (Ex J1, 667). However, the difficulties with
that statement of assets are that, first,
it refers to the value of several
properties, but the accuracy of Mr Pamboris’ estimate of the value of
those properties is
not established. Second, two of those properties are in
Cyprus and the Philippines and it is not apparent whether they, or the other
properties, could be readily realised to provide funds to the Company to pay in
the order of $10 million by way of the second instalment
of the deposit and
stamp duty within three months of the Contract. Third, the references to amounts
in bank accounts are mere assertions,
and there is no evidence that Mr Pamboris
was preparing to sell his furniture and whitegoods so as to fund the
Company’s immediate
obligations. Fourth, that statement of assets also
does not identify the amount of Mr Pamboris’ liabilities, although he
acknowledged
in the liquidator’s examination that amounts were likely
still owing on at least two of the Australian properties (Ex J1, 2397).
and perhaps most fundamentally, there is no evidence that Mr Pamboris had made
any commitment to the Company to sell his personal
assets so as to meet the
Company’s obligations due under the Contract. He does not give evidence
in these proceedings that
he intended to do so and it appears that he did not do
so. Mr Akinyemi’s reliance on the COVID-19 pandemic does not assist
Pamboris where the Company had no realistic basis to expect it could complete
the purchase of the Property, insufficient funds
and no funding commitment to
pay the deposit or stamp duty when due, even prior to the pandemic.
am satisfied that the entry into the Contract caused the Company to become
insolvent, where the Company had insufficient funds to
pay the whole of the
deposit at the time of the Contract and Mr Pamboris had no apparent plan as to
how the Company could fund the
balance of the deposit within the short time it
was due and no commitment from a lender in that regard. Mr Pamboris also made no
apparent attempt to obtain a third party valuation of the property and the
Company in fact contracted to purchase it at least twice
its market value. I am
satisfied that the Plaintiffs have established their claim for breach of general
law and statutory duties
on that basis. They are only entitled to recover
compensation in the amount of $5,000,000 paid out by the Company as to the first
instalment of the contract under this claim, where the Company is not liable to
pay the balance of the deposit for the reasons noted
below, and Westwood has not
profited by more than the deposit it has received.
breach of director’s duties in respect of payments to Waldron
Golledge describes this claim in submissions as directed to:
“the payment away of $3,225,[297.81] of Company money by the
Company’s sole director, [Mr Pamboris] to a company, Waldron
Projects Pty
Ltd [(“Waldron Projects”)], of which Mr Pamboris was the sole
director and sole shareholder in circumstances
where the Company derived no
benefit from those payments.”
Pamboris was at relevant times the sole director of Waldron Projects
(“Waldron Projects”) (ASC [17], substantially
admitted PD [17]). On
21 December 2018, the Company directed Bank of Sydney to pay to Waldron Projects
all payments of interest due
on a term deposit to which the Company was entitled
(ASC [18], admitted PD [18]). The Plaintiffs plead that Bank of Sydney made
payments of the interest due to the Company on the term deposit to
Waldon Projects totalling $225,297.01 (as amended in closing submissions)
[19]; that allegation was denied, possibly in error, in PD [19] but Mr Pamboris
did not seek to support that denial in submissions).
Between 25 February 2019 to
24 December 2019, the Company also made payments to Waldron Projects totalling
$3,000,000 (ASC [20],
admitted PD [20]). The Plaintiffs plead (ASC
[21]–[23A], partly admitted and otherwise denied PD
[21]–[24]):
“The Company was not obliged to make the payments listed in paragraph 19
or the payments listed in paragraph 20 (together,
the Waldron Payments) to
Waldron Projects.
The Company intended that some or all of the proceeds of the Waldron Payments
would be used by Waldron Projects to fund costs associated
with developing the
Some of the proceeds of the Waldron Payments were used by Waldron Projects to
fund costs associated with developing the Property.
Some of the proceeds of the Waldron Payments were paid to Susan Polios.”
14 July 2024, Waldron Projects was deregistered (ASC [24], admitted PD [24], WAD
have referred to the pleadings of Mr Pamboris’ general law and statutory
duties above. The Plaintiffs plead (ASC [30]–[34])
that Mr Pamboris
breached his general law and statutory duty of care and his duty of good faith
in causing the Company to make the
Waldron Payments where:
“(a) the Company was not obliged to make the Waldron
Payments; and
(b) the Company did not stand to benefit from making the
Waldron Payments.”
Plaintiffs also plead (ASC [34]–[36]) that:
“[Mr] Pamboris made the Waldron Payments for the improper purpose of
benefitting Waldron Projects and not for a proper purpose.
To the extent that the proceeds of the Waldron Payments were intended by the
Company to fund costs associated with developing the
Property, [Mr] Pamboris
wrongfully and in breach of the Duty of Care caused the Company to make the
Waldron Payments.
A reasonable person in the position of Pamboris as a director of the Company
would not have caused the Company to make the Waldron
Payments with the intent
to fund costs associated with developing the Property, because:
(a) at the time of each Waldron Payment, the Company had no
right to acquire any interest the Property; and
(b) it was not reasonable to make the Waldron Payments on the
basis that the Company might gain an interest in the Property at
some point in
the future.”
Plaintiffs in turn plead (ASC [40]–[42]) that, had Mr Pamboris acted in
accordance with his duty of care or his duty of
good faith, the Company would
not have made the Waldron Payments and, by reason of the breach of those duties,
the Company has suffered
loss and damage, particularised as the total of the
Waldron Payments, being $3,225,297.01 (as amended in closing submissions). The
Plaintiffs also plead that Mr Pamboris is liable to pay damages or compensation
to the Company for loss and damage suffered as a
result of his breaches of the duty of care and/or duty of good faith, relevantly
in respect of the Waldron Payments. I have addressed the applicable principles
Golledge submits that:
“The making of the Waldron Payments – that is, the paying away of
very substantial amounts of company money in favour
of a related entity and for
no apparent purpose or benefit (when viewed from the Company’s
perspective) is a prime example
of conduct which is in breach of both
... Mr Pamboris has not sought to explain himself and his actions by
evidence in these proceedings beyond the filing of a defence.
The Court would,
in those circumstances, draw the inference that no evidence he could give would
provide a legitimate explanation
for any of those payments.”
Golledge also submits that:
“the transactions (being the Waldron Payments) were not at arm’s
length, were not at value (there being no evidence of
any consideration
provided), and they left the Company deprived of over $3 million in liquid
funds. In the absence of any proper
explanation from Mr Pamboris – who, it
is to be remembered, was in total control of both the payer and the payee
– leaves the Court with no basis on the evidence for any
conclusion other than that the payments were made for the benefit
of Mr Pamboris
or of Waldron Projects and not for the Company.”
Akinyemi responds that:
“It is submitted that the [P]laintiffs have not established that the
Waldron Payments were not for the benefit of the Company
in that the purpose of
the payments was to further the development of property to be purchased by the
Company and at the time the
Company did not have any other creditors, and those
payments did not cause the Company to be insolvent.”
I pause to note that Mr Akinyemi’s reference to the property “to
be purchased” by the Company rightly recognises
that the Company did not
own the Property when the Waldron Payments were made and its future prospect of
acquiring the Property depended
on its capacity to pay the purchase price; the
proposition that the Company did not have other creditors is not established by
nor is the presence of other creditors at a point in time necessary to
establish a breach of duty owed to the Company arising from
the wrongful
application of its assets, and a company’s shareholders generally cannot
ratify a breach of statutory duty:
purpose of the Waldron Payments is unclear on the evidence. On one view, at
least partly adopted by Mr Gertos, they were made
As compensation to Mr Gertos
or his companies, where Mr Gertos had claimed that Mr Pamboris’ errors in
earlier development
applications had caused loss to Mr Gertos or his companies.
However, there is no suggestion that the Company (as distinct from Mr
or other entities associated with him) had caused any such loss to Mr Gertos or
his companies, or that the Company had any
liability to make such a payment in
compensation. Alternatively, it seemed to be suggested that the payments were
made to advance
the development of the Property and would benefit the Company on
acquiring the Property. That also did not provide a proper basis
payments, where they were all made before the Company entered into the Contract
and, even when that Contract was later executed,
the Company did not have
funding in place for or any real capacity to raise the balance of the deposit or
the stamp duty payable
in respect of the Property.
can also be no suggestion that the payments were properly characterised as a
loan by the Company to Waldron Projects, where
they are not recorded as a loan
in the Company’s financial records and, even if they had been, Mr Pamboris
had taken no apparent
steps to document that loan or establish whether Waldron
Projects was capable of repaying it. Even if a loan was made, that also

entitled to recover the pleaded amount of these payments against him.

first summarise the applicable principles. The term “transaction” is
relevantly defined, for the purposes of that section,
as a transaction to which
the body is a party, including, without limitation, a payment made by the body
or an obligation incurred
by it. That definition gives several examples of
transactions, which have the common characteristic that the conduct or dealing
engaged in by the company has the consequence of affecting a change in its
rights, liabilities or property:

it may be expected that a reasonable person
in the company’s circumstances
would not have entered into the transaction, having regard to the benefit and
detriment to the
company in entering the transaction, the benefit to other
parties to the transaction and any other relevant matter.
Plaintiffs plead (ASC [44]–[45], admitted PD [44]–[45], admitted WAD
[44]–[45]) that the Contract constitutes
a transaction of the Company
within the meaning of that term as defined in
(“Transaction”) and Westwood was a party to the Transaction; and
they plead (ASC [46], denied PD [46]) that it may be
expected that a reasonable
person in the Company’s circumstances would not have entered into the
Transaction having regard
to the lack of benefit to the Company of entering into
the Transaction, particularised by reference to its inability to pay the balance
of the deposit and, at the time of entering the Transaction, had no reasonable
prospects of doing so; the detriment suffered by the
Company of entering into
the Transaction, particularised by reference to the amount of $5,000,100 paid to
Westwood and the $4,999,900
debt to Westwood for the unpaid balance of the
deposit; and the benefits to Westwood of entering into the Transaction,
particularised
as at least $5,000,100, being that part of the deposit paid by
the Company to Westwood.

Plaintiffs particularise that claim as follows:
“On entry into the Contract for Sale, the Company became liable to pay the
$10,000,000 million deposit as follows (i) the sum
of $100 on the date of the
contract; [[ii) the sum of $5,000,000 on or before 31 March 2020; and (iii) the
balance of $4,999,900
on or before 30 June 2020 or termination of the Contract
for Sale by the vendor.
Once the Company had paid the deposit instalment of $5,000,000 on 25 [March]
2020, the Company had cash on hand of only about $2933.25
between its three
current bank accounts: (i) Bankwest Account - $2,663.31; (ii) Term Deposit
Account - $0 (iii) Second Cheque Account
Other than the $2933.25 in its bank accounts and any rights it had as purchaser
under the Contract for Sale, the Company had no assets
or no substantial
The Company did not have any committed finance to fund the balance of the
deposit payable by 26 June 2020, nor did any third party
have an obligation to
provide funding to it.
Further, the Company did not have any committed finance to fund the balance of
the deposit payable by the extended date of 30 September
2020, nor did any third
party have an obligation to provide funding to it: (i) There was no reasonable
prospect of the Company securing
funding from any third party as would allow it
to make either of the payments referred to ... above, and (ii) The Company was
no revenue at the time of entry in to the Contract for Sale.”
Golledge in turn submits, and I accept, that:
“In determining whether the Contract is or was uncommercial within the
regard must be had to the following
features of the subject transaction:
[1] (the benefit to the Company) The only discernible benefit
to the Company was the ultimate ownership interest in the Property.
that depended entirely on the Company’s ability to satisfy its obligations
under the Contract, including the payment
of $10 million within three months,
being approximately $5 million more than the Company possessed in (liquid and
illiquid) assets
at the time, and $90 million within three years (special
condition 8 of the Contract [Ex J1], 1324), when there was no income being
generated by the Company and no finance available to enable that payment.
[2] (the detriment to the Company) Upon entry into the
Contract, the Company was immediately exposed to liability for (at least)
entirety of the $10 million deposit, which is forfeited to Westwood (if paid)
and subject to recovery by Westwood (if unpaid)
pursuant to clause 14 of the
Contract. Further, even if the Company had completed the Contract (which is
highly questionable on the
evidence), the detriment to the Company was the
overpayment by many millions of dollars for [the Property] ...
(Benefits to other parties) Westwood stood to gain significantly from the
Contract. It had not, by that stage, actually become the
owner of the Property.
It had entered a contract to purchase it, the settlement of which was not due to
occur until 2021. The transaction
with the Company, in effect, underwrote the
commercial risk (if any) it undertook when agreeing to buy the property for $26
If the contract with the Company did complete then Westwood would have
made a 400% return on its investment for no additional outlay
or work. If not
completed, it retained its rights under the contract with the then owner plus it
stood to receive (at least) the
windfall $10 million from the Company by way of
the deposit.”
Akinyemi responds that:
“It is submitted that it is generally accepted that the market value of
something is the price at which a willing but not anxious
vendor would sell, and
at which a willing but not anxious purchaser would buy.
On 19 November 2019 China Evergrande Group offers to Westwood to purchase the
Punchbowl Property for $75,000,000 [Ex J1, 684]. Mr
Gertos’ evidence also
stated in cross examination that he received an offer of $80,000,000.00. That
offer was not accepted
by Westwood. It should be accepted then that the
Punchbowl Property was worth more than $80,000,000.
The evidence is that the Company and Westwood negotiated the price, and further
Mr Pamboris, an experienced accountant that has been
involved in property
development projects for clients, held the belief that $100 million was a fair
price [Ex J1, 2303], when the
projected gain at the end of the development was
$125 million [Ex J1, 2304].”
do not accept this submission. First, the expert valuation evidence has valued
the Property, at best, at about half of the Contract
price, even after adopting
favourable assumptions as to development approvals. I have addressed the
reliance on the China Evergrande
“offer” above, which, if authentic,
was subject to extended due diligence and was not capable of acceptance. I do
accept Mr Gertos’ evidence for the reasons noted above and, even if I
did, a vendor’s rejection of an offer plainly does
not establish a market
price in excess of that offer, where it is equally consistent with an inflated
price expectation or a hope
that a foolish purchaser will later emerge and pay
more than the rejected price. I address Mr Pamboris’ evidence in the
liquidator’s
examination in dealing with Westwood’s submission below
and recognise that he did not give evidence in these proceedings.
Akinyemi also relies on the matters noted in paragraph 60 above to submit that
the entry into the Contract was not an uncommercial
transaction. I do not accept
those submissions for the reasons noted above and they do not support that
proposition where the uncommercial
character of the transaction arose, at least,
from the extent to which the price to be paid for the Property (if, contrary to
fact, the Company could have paid it) exceeded its true value.
Jordan, for Westwood, fairly accepted in closing submissions that there was
nothing that Westwood could put to rebut a claim that
the Contract was an
uncommercial transaction, given the common view of the valuers as to the extent
to which the contract price had
exceeded the value of the Property, other than
Mr Pamboris’ claim in the liquidator’s examination that, if COVID-19
not intervened, “once the property is completed to its maximum use, it
should have a projected $125 million gain in the end”.
That evidence does
not assist Westwood. First, Mr Pamboris was there unable to identify any support
for that proposition, beyond
his assertion of it; and, even if it were correct,
the Company have sufficient funds to pay the balance of the deposit or the stamp
duty in respect of the Property, so as to achieve ownership of it; nor would it
affect the value of the Property, where the valuers
had addressed its potential
in their valuations.
am satisfied that, having regard to these matters and in the circumstances which
I noted above in addressing the claim for breach
of director’s duties and
where Mr Pamboris had made no apparent attempt to obtain a third party valuation
of the property and
the Company in fact contracted to purchase it at least twice
its market value, a reasonable person in its circumstances would not
entered the Contract and the Contract was an uncommercial transaction within the
Plaintiffs also plead (ASC [49], denied PD [49]) that the Transaction was an
insolvent transaction within the meaning of
section 588FC
transaction is an insolvent transaction of a company, as defined in that
section, if, relevantly, it is an uncommercial transaction
of the company and
the transaction is entered into at a time the company is insolvent or the
company becomes insolvent because of
matters including its entry into the
transaction.
Golledge submits that:
“The evidence also establishes that at the time the Company entered the
Contract, it was insolvent or became insolvent as a
result of entering the
Contract, which required payment of $5 million within three months and $90
million in two years’ time.
Further, as at March 2020 (when the Contract
was entered):
[1] The Company had recorded a net negative (loss) position for
each financial year of its existence (2016 to 2022) save for the
financial year
ending 2019, being the financial year in which it received over $8 million from
TfNSW as compensation, though by financial
year end it had already whittled that
figure down by over $1.5 million and the Company returned to a loss position of
($6,780,820.50)
by 30 June 2020 ([Ex J1, 2153, 2165]);
[2] By March 2020, the $6.5 million left of the TfNSW
compensation payment had been further depleted by the Waldron Payments, with
$2,573,898.20 being paid in the financial year ending 30 June 2020...
[3] After payment of the $5 million deposit (which occurred on
25 March 2020), the Company had only $2,933.25 between its three
bank accounts
[Ex J1, 3501; 3507, 3515].
[4]. The Company did not have any committed finance to fund the
balance of the deposit, no apparent prospects of raising the deposit
no third party had an obligation to pay that deposit...
[5] Further, in circumstances where it appears the books and
records of the Company were not sufficiently maintained to comply
, a presumption of insolvency is also available (see Darin 2 [65],
Report to Creditors dated 20 December 2021 at 2.3, [Ex J1, 421).
In any event,
the evidence discharges the onus of proving actual insolvency upon entering into
the Contract.”
Golledge also submits, and I accept, that:
“In accordance with authority
(Lewis v Doran
[2004] NSWSC 608
(2004) 50 ACSR 175
per Palmer J), the Court will, when considering a case which
requires a determination as to whether, at a particular time in the
company was or was not solvent, have the “inestimable benefit” of
hindsight. Relevantly, for present purposes,
in determining whether the Company
was insolvent on 26 March 2020, or became so upon entry into the Contract, the
Court can see whether
the company was actually paying all of its debts as they
fell due and “...whether it did, or did not, actually pay all of the
which, although not due as at the alleged date of insolvency, nevertheless
became due at a time which, as a matter of commercial
reality and common sense,
had to be considered as at the date of insolvency. By reference to what actually
happened, rather than
to conflicting experts’ opinions as to the
implications of balance sheets, the court’s task in assessing insolvency
at the alleged date should not be very difficult”. The debt payable for
stamp duty and the balance of the deposit (within three
months of the contract
date) were such debts and they were not paid and the evidence comfortably
establishes they were not paid because
neither Mr Pamboris nor the Company had
the funds to do so. Suggestions by Westwood that that conclusion ought not be
circumstances where it is accepted that Mr Pamboris himself owned a
few properties ought be rejected in circumstances where there
is no evidence of
the value of those properties or as to the extent to which any of them were
security for other debts or as to Mr
Pamboris’ ability to secure funds
from any lender, based on those assets, and which could be provided to the
Company to enable
it to meet those debts.”
Akinyemi relies on the matters noted in paragraph 60 above to submit that the
entry into the Contract did not of itself cause the
Company to be insolvent. I
do not accept those submissions for the reasons noted above and they do not
support that proposition where
the Company’s insolvency arose from its
inability to pay the balance of the deposit or stamp duty in the short term and,
the reasons noted above, the evidence does not establish that Mr Pamboris
had sufficient assets to pay those amounts and he had not
committed to do so.
am satisfied that the Company’s entry into the Contract caused the Company
to become insolvent, where it had insufficient
funds to pay the whole of the
deposit at the time of the Contract and Mr Pamboris had no apparent plan as to
how the Company could
fund the balance of the deposit within the short time it
was due and no commitment from a lender in that regard. A mere hope that
Company could obtain some of financing, at some point in the future, for the
obligation to pay the balance of the deposit does
not displace the fact of
insolvency at the point the liability to pay that amount arose under the
Contract. Mr Jordan fairly accepted
in closing submissions that, if (as I have
found) the entry into the Contract was an uncommercial transaction under

turn to the applicable principles and have here drawn on my summary of them in
Re Alsafe Security Products Pty Ltd atf the Alsafe Trust (in liq)
Subsection 588FG(2)
Corporations Act
(2) A court is not to make under
section 588FF
materially prejudicing a right or interest of a person if the transaction is not
an unfair loan to the company, or an unreasonable
director-related transaction
of the company, and it is proved that:
(a) the person became a party to the transaction in good faith;
(b) at the time when the person became such a party:
(i) the person had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that
the company was insolvent at that time or would become insolvent as
mentioned in
paragraph 588FC(b); and
(ii) a reasonable person in the person’s circumstances
would have had no such grounds for so suspecting; and
(c) the person has provided valuable consideration under the
transaction or has changed his, her or its position in reliance on
transaction.
bears the onus of establishing the defence under
and, in order to do
so, must establish that, first, it had entered the Contract and received the
first deposit payment from the Company
in good faith (subs (2)(a)).
Importantly, as Mr Golledge points out, the requirement of “good
faith” in an uncommercial
transaction case will focus attention on the
defendant’s “purpose motive and intention” in entering the
transaction
including the defendant’s appreciation of the uncommercial or
possible uncommercial nature of the transaction:

, Spigelman CJ at [123] also observed that:
“It may well be that a failure to make inquiries will, in some cases, be
of considerable significance when determining the
good faith element of the
defence under
s 588FG(2)(a).
It may also be the case that the absence of
information, including the failure of the debtor to proffer such, will be of
significance
in determining whether a reasonable person would have had
reasonable grounds for suspicion under (b)(ii).”
Jordan submits that Westwood’s entry into the Contract in good faith is
established by several matters, namely that the transaction
was negotiated at
arm's length over a period of approximately three months, with a purchase price
arrived at by “commercial
negotiations” and the purchase price of
$100,000,000 was within the range of market valuations, a matter that was
plainly not
established by the valuation or other evidence. He submits that
Westwood had no reason to suspect the transaction was uncommercial
“[t]he mere fact that the price could be considered a
‘premium’ does not make it uncommercial”. I do
not accept that
submission where the price was so far out of market and that must have been
apparent to Mr Gertos in the circumstances.
Mr Jordan submits that Mr Gertos
believed that Mr Pamboris and his “overseas equity partners” had the
financial capacity
to complete the transaction and that Mr Gertos had spoken
directly with the Mr Pamboris’ equity partner in Cyprus, who confirmed
that funds were available through a large financial institution and that
Australian lenders, including Westpac, would provide the
balance and that Mr
Gertos verified this with Mr Smith. I do not accept that submission, which seeks
to treat evidence as proof
of the fact where it was admitted only on a limited
basis that it does not prove the fact, and I have pointed to the inconsistencies
in Mr Gertos’ evidence at various times above. Fifth, Mr Jordan submits
that the transaction was consistent with the Company’s
course of business as a property developer and investor”, but that is not
established by its one previous attempt
to acquire the Annadale property which
it needed to complete.
am not satisfied that Westwood’s good faith is established, where it must
have been apparent to Mr Gertos that there was at
least a prospect the Property
was being sold at overvalue, given the difference between the price for which
Westwood would acquire
the Property (albeit with the benefit of the option) and
the sale price under the Contract; he knew that the Company was a proprietary
company that had paid $5 million as the first part of the deposit; he knew the
Company was assuming a liability to pay a little short
of that amount as the
second part of the deposit within three months, and substantial stamp duty; he
knew the Company was assuming
liability to pay $100 million within two years;
and, on his own evidence, he made no inquiry to determine whether there was even
a slight prospect that it could do so, prior to any difficulties arising from
order to establish the defence, Westwood must show that, at the time of entering
the Contract and receiving that first deposit
payment, it did not have
reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Company was insolvent or would become
insolvent by reason of
entering the Contract and making the payment
(subs (2)(b)(i)) and that a reasonable person in its circumstances would
not have had
reasonable grounds for such a suspicion (subs (2)(b)(ii):

s 588FG(2)(b)(i)
hybrid in character, since it is directed to whether the particular creditor,
with its perspicacity, the information available
to it, and with any analysis of
that information that it had made, had “no reasonable grounds” for
suspecting insolvency
at the relevant time, and the requirement for “no
reasonable grounds” is objective in character:

reasonably available in those circumstances and making the analysis of that
information which a reasonable person would make, would
have had reasonable
grounds to suspect the debtor’s insolvency:

at 658, Doyle CJ observed that the requirement to establish the negative
s 588FG(2)(b)(ii)
was a fairly demanding test.
Jordan submits that Westwood had no reasonable grounds for suspecting the
Company's insolvency at 26 March 2020 where the Contract
provided for an
extended settlement period of two years from exchange and this was consistent
with the Company's stated intention
to obtain development approval and funding
from overseas equity partners and Australian lenders. This does not assist
Westwood where
the obvious risk of the Company’s insolvency arose in
respect of the balance of the deposit and stamp duty due by June 2020.
also submits that Mr Gertos had been informed by Mr Pamboris that funding was
available through overseas equity partners
and again refers to the conversation
with Mr Smith, but this does not assist Westwood for the reasons noted above.
Third, Mr Jordan
submits that the Company had previously contracted to purchase
the Annandale Property for $68,000,000 in June 2016, “demonstrating
track record of engaging in large-scale property transactions.” That
matter demonstrates no such thing where, as Mr Gertos
plainly knew, the Company
was never required to perform that contract because of the compulsory
acquisition of the property by TfNSW.
Fifth, Mr Jordan submits that Westwood had
no knowledge of the Company's internal financial position nor was he reasonably
to have such knowledge and “[t]here were no external indicators
of insolvency at the time of exchange.” However, as I
note below, Westwood
at least knew the Company was a proprietary company that had assume obligations
to pay in the order of $10 million
in three months and that was sufficient to
indicate insolvency, absent reason to think that it had the capacity to make
those payments.
Mr Jordan also submits that Mr Pamboris gave a personal
guarantee of the Company’s obligations. I address the evidence as
mater below, but that does not assist Westwood where that contemplates the
Company’s failure to meet those obligations,
rather than supporting its
Jordan also submits that the Contract was executed on 26 March 2020, at the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, and the
request for an extension to
pay the deposit in June 2020 must be assessed in this context as it did not
indicate pre-existing insolvency
but rather the impact of the pandemic on
funding markets. Again, this does not assist Westwood where the Company’s
to pay the balance of the deposit and stamp duty due in June 2020
pre-existed any issue arising from the pandemic.
Jordan relies on much the same matters to submit that a reasonable person in
Westwood’s circumstances would not have had
reasonable grounds for
suspecting insolvency and submits that:
“A reasonable businessperson would regard the extended settlement period
and staged deposit structure as consistent with ordinary
commercial practice in
large-scale property transactions.
A reasonable businessperson would rely on representations made by the [Company]
regarding funding arrangements. A reasonable businessperson
would regard these
representations as credible.
A reasonable businessperson would take comfort from [Mr Pamboris’]
personal guarantee.
A reasonable businessperson would not conduct a detailed forensic investigation
of the purchaser's financial position in the absence
of any red flag or warning
sign or at all.
The fact that the [Company] subsequently failed to pay the balance of the
deposit does not establish that a reasonable businessperson
should have
suspected insolvency at the time of exchange.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 introduced significant
uncertainty into property and financial markets, which may
have affected the
Second Plaintiff's ability to secure funding. A reasonable businessperson would
not have anticipated in March 2020
the scale and duration of the pandemic's
impact on financial markets. The subsequent difficulty in paying the deposit in
reflected this unprecedented disruption, not pre-existing insolvency.
The agreed purchase price of $100,000,000 was within the range of market
valuations, had the 2018 Gateway determination
[been] successfully
[emphasis added.
The 2018 Gateway Determination dated 25 May, which,
if successfully
, would have resulted in a significant uplift in gross floor area
representing a circa 150% increase in redevelopment potential.”
the risk of repetition, the first of these matters does not assist in addressing
the Company’s insolvency arising from obligations
due in June 2020. The
last two additional points arising from the Gateway Determination also do not
assist Westwood, where any outcome
of that determination was (as the submissions
recognise) only prospective, and would not assist the Company where it could not
the payments due in June 2020 or complete the acquisition of the Property
so as to benefit from any later appreciation of its value.
I otherwise do not
accept that submission for the reasons that I did not accept that the
corresponding matters displaced reasonable
grounds for Westwood to submit the
Company’s insolvency.
am not satisfied either that Westwood did not have reasonable grounds for
suspecting that the Company was insolvent or would become
insolvent by reason of
entering the Contract and making the payment or that a reasonable person in its
circumstances would not have
had reasonable grounds for such a suspicion.
Westwood’s knowledge of no more than the fact that a proprietary company,
apparent financial backing, was assuming liability to pay the balance of
the deposit within three months and an obviously substantial
amount of stamp
duty raised the risk of the Company’s insolvency, and Mr Gertos made no
inquiry that was capable of displacing
that risk. The relevant matters were
known to Westwood, through Mr Gertos, at the relevant time, where they arise
from the obvious
disconnect between the magnitude of the contractual obligations
assumed by the Company and its financial and borrowing capacity,
self-evident to Mr Gertos. I am satisfied that Westwood cannot establish a
defence because the matters which gave rise
to the Company’s insolvency
were known to it, through Mr Gertos, at the relevant time and Westwood had
plainly had reasonable
grounds to know, and not merely suspect, that the Company
would become insolvent by its entry into the Contract.
in order to establish the defence, Westwood must show that, at the time of
entering the Contract and receiving that payment,
it had provided valuable
consideration for the entry into the Contract and the receipt of the payment. I
am satisfied that it had
done so, by the rights conferred on the Company under
the Contract, but that alone is not sufficient to establish the defence.
the Plaintiffs have established the elements of their claim under
, and Westwood has not established its defence under
the Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief claimed against Westwood on this
Westwood’s Cross-Claim as to the Property
is convenient to deal here with Westwood’s Cross-Claim filed on 11
November 2024, Westwood seeks judgment against Mr Pamboris
in the amount of
$4,909,900 and judgment against the Company and/or the liquidator in the same
amount. The claim against the liquidator
personally was rightly not pressed. Mr
Jordan fairly recognises this claim is the converse of the Plaintiffs’
claim under
and would fail if their claim succeeds, as
it has. I will nonetheless address this claim more fully.
pleads substantially the same terms of the Contract as the Plaintiffs in that
regard and relies, in its claim against Mr
Pamboris, on his personal guarantee
of the Company’s obligations under the Contract under special condition
22. Westwood claims
the amount of $4,999,900 was due to it on its termination of
the Contract on 8 October 2020 and pleads that neither the Company,
Liquidator nor Mr Pamboris have paid that amount. By his Defence to the
Cross-Claim, Mr Pamboris largely admits the allegations
against him, including
that he is liable to pay Westwood the balance of the deposit in the amount of
$4,999,990 pursuant to the personal
guarantee. By its Defence to the
Cross-Claim, the Company largely admits the terms of the Contract and denied it
is liable to pay
the balance due under the Contract.
should address the evidence as to the guarantee on which Westwood relies here.
As I noted above, by his third affidavit dated 17
April 2025, Mr Darin referred
to the circumstances in which he became aware of the personal guarantee
purportedly given under the
Contract, which is deleted in the copies of the
Contract held by the Company (see also Ex J1, 1331, 1361, 1616, there followed
a further page purportedly containing an executed copy of the guarantee at
1617) and apparently retained in another version of the
Contract on which
Westwood relies. By her affidavit dated 5 November 2025, Ms Pettit referred to
documents produced to the Court
including a file produced by Westwood in respect
of the sale of the Property (Ex P4). That file contained a copy of the Contract
dated 26 March 2020, signed by Mr Gertos, in which the pages of the special
conditions (other than the guarantee by corporate purchaser)
was signed by Mr
Gertos, and cl 22 providing for a guarantee for corporate purchaser had been
deleted and that page was not signed
by Mr Gertos. The copies of the exchanged
Contracts held by the Company (Ex P3A) and also produced on subpoena also did
not include
the guarantee on which Westwood now relies.
his affidavit in the proceedings, Mr Gertos did not address the circumstances in
which the Contract had been executed or how it
come to include the guarantee on
which Westwood relies, although that guarantee is not included in the
counterparts of the Contract
held by the Company. However, to establish the
existence of the guarantee, Westwood relied on a purported file note dated 26
2020 prepared by Mr Gertos which read as follows:
“Contract of Sale was left on my Desk.
1) Purchase 921 Punchbowl Road, Punchbowl NSW.
2) Purchaser Portmans Securities Pty Ltd
Purchase price $100,000,000 –
Deposit 10% 10,000,000.
3) Executed by Mario Pamboris as sole director.
On Review of Contract the Personal Guarantee and item 22 was crossed out.
I Rejected the Contract and requested that the guarantee be signed.
contract Witnessed by Mr Con Savell of Westwood Accountants.
I proceeded with the exchange.”
am not satisfied that this note was a contemporaneous or accurate record of
events. First, it is the only file note produced by
Westwood in respect of any
issue in the proceedings. Second, Mr Gertos explained in cross-examination that
he had prepared it because
he was annoyed by Mr Pamboris’ refusal to give
the guarantee and contemplated suing him for wasting Mr Gertos’ time;
however, as Mr Golledge pointed out, that evidence made no sense where, if the
file note was true, the issue was resolved by the
time it was prepared and only
30 minutes had been wasted, before the contract containing the guarantee was
Savell’s affidavit evidence was that he personally witnessed Mr
Pamboris’ signature of the guarantee, in a meeting
at which Mr Pamboris
and Mr Gertos were present at the same time and he saw Mr Pamboris sign his name
and then signed the guarantee
as witness. Although that Mr Savell was not
cross-examined, I am unable to accept his evidence as to the circumstances in
guarantee was signed. That evidence related to events about five years
before the date of his affidavit. His evidence is entirely
inconsistent with Mr
Gertos’ account of what occurred, namely that Mr Gertos was left a copy of
the contract from which the
guarantee had been crossed out and was subsequently
provided a signed guarantee, and with Mr Gertos’ purported contemporaneous
file note of what had occurred, which did not record any process by which he, Mr
Savell and Mr Pamboris met in a conference room
and Mr Savell witnessed Mr
Pamboris’ execution of the guarantee in Mr Gertos’ presence. I have
explained above why I
do not accept any aspect of Mr Gertos’ evidence,
where it is uncorroborated, and I do not assume that Mr Gertos’ account
what occurred is truthful. However, the inconsistency between Mr Gertos’
account of what occurred and Mr Savell’s
account of what occurred also
leaves me with no confidence that Mr Savell’s account is correct. Mr
Savell’s affidavit
is also inconsistent with his evidence at the
liquidator’s examination that he could not remember any involvement in the
of the Contact between Westwood and the Company, and that he “was
not involved in that transaction or in that contract”
(Ex J1, 2503).
bear in mind that Mr Pamboris admitted liability under the guarantee and has not
sought to withdraw that admission. That admission
is not, however, binding upon
the Plaintiffs, so far as, for example, Athenee relied on any liability under
the guarantee so as to
support the grant of the mortgage to it. Westwood’s
Cross-Claim against Mr Pamboris must fail, despite his admission, because
internal inconsistencies in Westwood’s and Athenee’s case mean that
I cannot be satisfied that Mr Pamboris still
owes the amount claimed to
Westwood. The first possibility is that Athenee’s defence (that, in
effect, it paid that amount
at Mr Pamboris’ direction to Westwood so as to
support the security it obtained) is unfounded, and Westwood was not paid out.
The second possibility is that Athenee’s defence is well-founded and
Westwood was previously paid out at Mr Pamboris’
direction with funds
advanced by Athenee, and Westwood’s Cross-Claim claim must therefore fail.
A third possibility, which
is plainly open given the inconsistencies and
implausibilities in Westwood’s evidence and the absence of evidence from
is that the true position is different again and undisclosed by the
evidence. The evidence does not establish any one of these possibilities
balance of probabilities and Westwood’s case against Mr Pamboris must fail
for that reason.
Cross-Claim against the Company must fail for these reasons and for the reason
that the Company is not bound by the
admission made by Mr Pamboris and because I
cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any guarantee by Mr
became part of the Contract or otherwise took effect, given the
inconsistencies between Mr Gertos’ and Mr Savell’s accounts
that guarantee was given. There was never a proper basis for a claim against by
Westwood against the liquidator personally,
irrespective of that result, since a
liquidator appointed to an insolvent company does not assume personal liability
for that Company’s
obligations, and that claim has not been pressed . For
these reasons, the Cross-Claim is dismissed with costs.

again address the applicable principles and I have here drawn on my judgment in
at [249]ff.
Section 37A
Conveyancing Act
provides that:
“(1) Save as provided in this section, every alienation
of property, made whether before or after the commencement of the
Conveyancing (Amendment) Act
, with intent to defraud creditors,
shall be voidable at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced.
(2) This section does not affect the law of bankruptcy for the
time being in force.
(3) This section does not extend to any estate or interest in
property alienated to a purchaser in good faith not having, at the
time of the
alienation, notice of the intent to defraud creditors.”
Marcolongo v Chen
(2011) 242 CLR 546
[2011] HCA 3
, the High Court
observed (at [20] and [31]–[32]) that the section is to be accorded a
“liberal construction” and
extends to prohibit conduct which may
“delay, hinder or defraud” a creditor or potential creditor, and the
infer an intention by the transferor of property to defeat or delay
creditors, even in the absence of direct evidence of that intention,
outcome was the necessary consequence of a voluntary settlement.
Patel v Lal
[2011] NSWSC 603
, Biscoe AJ similarly observed
“Section 37A should receive a liberal construction in effecting its
purpose of suppressing fraud. The term “defraud”
in s 37A means to
delay, hinder or otherwise defraud:
Marcolongo v Chen
[above] at [19],
[20], [58]. It is unnecessary to show that the debtor wanted creditors to suffer
a loss or that the debtor had a
purpose of causing loss. It is necessary to show
the existence of an intention to hinder, delay or defeat creditors and in that
to show that accordingly the debtor had acted dishonestly. If the debtor
disposes of an asset which would be available to creditors
with the intention of
prejudicing them by putting it, or its worth, beyond their reach, he is in the
ordinary case acting in a fashion
not honest in the context of the relationship
of debtor and creditor. In cases of voluntary disposition that intention may be
at [32]. A person may have acted dishonestly, judged by the standards
of ordinary, decent people, without appreciating that the act
in question was
dishonest: at [33]. The party seeking to avoid the disposition bears the onus of
proving an intent to defraud. While
the existence of the intent may be inferred
from the evidence, it is to be found as a fact: at [34]. Sections [sic] 37A does
require the intent to defraud to be the sole or predominant intent: at

the surrounding circumstances, it appears the effect

now to the applicable facts, by a document titled “Letter of Offer”
from Athenee to Mr Pamboris and purportedly
dated 31 January 2025, long before
Athenee was incorporated, Athenee purportedly proposed first registered
mortgages over each of
the Paddington Property and the Marrickville Property. A
further letter of the same purported date states, inter alia, that Mr
loan has been approved by Athenee Securities and that a letter
of offer from Athenee, “a division of” Athenee Securities
enclosed; is signed by “Ms S Polias, director”; and encloses the
“Letter of Offer”. A letter dated purportedly
dated 24 February 2025
from Athenee, also before it was incorporated, states, inter alia, “We
thank you for returning your
executed letter of offer delivered to us on the
20th February, 2025”. These communications are inconsistent with the fact
Athenee was not incorporated until 25 March 2025 (Ex J1, 3448), with Ms
Polias as its sole director and shareholder.
27 March 2025, Mr Pamboris and Athenee purportedly executed a Mortgage Linked
Loan Agreement and other documents. The loan agreement
referred to a principal
of $5 million; Annexure A to the mortgage(s) contained an acknowledgement that
the $5 million had been received;
and "Ancillary Security Documents" purportedly
dated 17 April 2025 included a direction by Mr Pamboris that $5 million less a
Amount (as defined) for interest payable under the mortgage be paid to
an account in Westwood's name. As I noted above, if those
documents were
accurate and the transaction recorded by them occurred, then the balance of the
deposit due by the Company under the
Contract was repaid and Westwood’s
Cross-Claim must fail. I cannot reach a finding as to whether that was the fact
reasons noted below.
12 May 2025, at a directions hearing attended by legal representatives for Mr
Pamboris and Westwood, Nixon J set this matter down
for hearing for five days
commencing 4 November 2025. The next day, on 13 May 2025, mortgages in favour of
Athenee were lodged over
each of the Paddington and Marrickville Properties.
Each of the mortgages was stated to secure the amount of $5,000,000 in favour
Athenee, which was stated to be acknowledged as received by Mr Pamboris as
mortgagor and was the remaining amount for which the
Company was liable to
Westwood under the Contract. No further evidence was led by Athenee or Mr
Pamboris of any advance in fact made
by Athenee to Mr Pamboris or to Westwood at
his direction secured by one or more of the mortgages.
Plaintiffs plead (ASC [62]–[64]) that the effect of the mortgages is to
prevent the Marrickville Property and the Paddington
Property (including the
equity in those properties) from being available to the Plaintiffs and other
creditors of Mr Pamboris; further,
or in the alternative, to delay or hinder the
Plaintiffs and other creditors of Mr Pamboris from realising the Paddington
and/or the Marrickville Property; and, further, or in the alternative,
the effect of the mortgages is to reduce the amount which
would otherwise become
available to creditors of Mr Pamboris, including the liquidator, for the purpose
of satisfying debts owed
by Mr Pamboris. They also plead (ASC [65]–[67])
that Mr Pamboris granted the mortgages with those intended effects; that his
grant of the mortgages constituted an alienation of property pursuant to s
Conveyancing Act
; and that the Company is prejudiced by Mr
Pamboris’ grant of the mortgages.
Golledge submits that:
“The relevant circumstances in the present case include the following:
[1] The Mortgages were granted the day after the matter was set
down for final hearing, with such hearing to determine whether
Mr Pamboris owes
over $13 million and breached his Duties and (on the Cross-Claim) whether he
owes close to $5 million to Westwood;
[2] The mortgagee is associated with Westwood, being both a
subsidiary of a company of which Westwood’s director was formerly
director, and itself having as sole director and shareholder Susan Polias, the
wife of Westwood’s director;
[3] The letter of offer for the Mortgages was purportedly
issued by the mortgagee almost two months before it came into existence.
back dating is highly suspicious and suggests an attempt to disguise the true
circumstances in which the Mortgages were created;
[4] The advance allegedly provided (and of which Mr Pamboris
acknowledges receipt: Annexure A to the Mortgage, [Ex J1],.4574) is
the exact amount sought by Westwood from Mr Pamboris in these proceedings, and
is the exact amount which Westwood would
have to disgorge to the plaintiffs if
they succeed in their claim. However, as noted above, the evidence does not
suggest that the
Personal Guarantee actually formed part of the Contract such
that Mr Pamboris has any obligation for the amount sought by Westwood
Cross-claim;
[5] Mr Pamboris directed the purported advance to be paid to
Westwood; and
[6]. No explanation has been provided by Mr Pamboris or the
Mortgagee for the timing of these transactions and no evidence has
been served
which explains their commercial origins.
It is of particular significance that:
[1] Mr Pamboris has not adduced any evidence explaining the
Mortgages; and
[2] Athenee has not appeared in the substantive proceeding, has
not filed a defence, and has not led any evidence to explain what
is plainly a
significant financial transaction. It is apparent, however, ... that Athenee is
well aware of the proceedings... ”.
Golledge also submits, and I accept, that the facts of this case are similar to
Peters v Lithgow Forge Pty Ltd & Ors
[2011] NSWSC 1185
where Slattery J held that a mortgage granted by a corporate entity controlled
by the debtor’s sister on the same day as the
debtor became liable under a
costs certificate was voidable under
Conveyancing Act
I noted above, Athenee does not appear. However, Mr Pamboris seeks to support
the security taken by Athenee and Mr Akinyemi submits
“The cross-claim was filed on 11 November 2024 and Mr Pamboris’
defence to that cross-claim admitting liability of $4,999,900
to Westwood was
filed on 29 November 2024.
Athenee provided to Mr Pamboris an offer to lend $5 million in January 2025 [I
interpolate, purportedly long before it had been incorporated],
ie shortly after
Mr Pamboris has accepted his liability to Westwood, and the mortgage was granted
on 13 May 2025.
It is submitted that at the time of the granting of the mortgage to Athenee, the
Liquidator was already seeking orders that the Contract
for Sale be voided, Mr
Pamboris had accepted his liability to Westwood pursuant to the Guarantee, and
in those circumstances the
purpose of granting the mortgage, being to procure
funds to pay the admitted liability, could not have been with intent to defraud
creditors, because if the Liquidator was successful against Westwood, any funds
procured from Athenee and paid by Mr Pamboris to
Westwood would have discharged
Mr Pamboris’ obligation to Westwood and if the Liquidator was successful,
the funds would be
payable by Westwood to the Company, thereby reducing any
monies payable by Mr Pamboris.”
I do not accept this submission for the reasons noted below, and the fact
that the transaction may have increased Westwood’s
potential liability is
no answer to this claim if it had the requisite character in seeking to defeat
or obstruct the claim against
Mr Pamboris.
am satisfied that Mr Pamboris’ grant of mortgages to Athenee over the
Paddington and Marrickville Properties should be declared
void pursuant to
Conveyancing Act
. The correspondence that supports the
mortgages is plainly false, at least in part, where it includes an offer of
finance purportedly
made long before Athenee was incorporated. There is a real
question, which I need not decide, whether Athenee advanced funds to Mr
Pamboris, given the other possibilities I noted above and the fact that it does
not appear or seeks to establish any advance of funds.
any event, the timing of the transaction, occurring on the day after this matter
was fixed for hearing by Nixon J, unexplained
by any evidence from Athenee,
combined with the false documents on which it relies, is sufficient to find the
matters for which the
Plaintiffs contend, namely that the transaction was
entered into to prevent the Marrickville Property and the Paddington Property
(including the equity in those properties) from being available to the
Plaintiffs and other creditors of Mr Pamboris; and further,
alternative, to delay or hinder the Plaintiffs and other creditors of Mr
Pamboris from realising the Paddington Property
and/or the Marrickville
Property; and, further or in the alternative, the effect of the mortgages is to
reduce the amount which would
otherwise become available to creditors of Mr
Pamboris, including the liquidator, for the purpose of satisfying debts owed by
Pamboris. I will make the declarations sought by the Plaintiffs on that
Plaintiffs have been substantially successful in their claims. I direct the
parties to submit agreed short minutes of order to
give effect to this judgment,
including as to costs, within seven days or, if there is no agreement, their
respective draft short
minutes and submissions not exceeding five pages in Arial
font 12, one and a half spacing, as to the differences between them.
