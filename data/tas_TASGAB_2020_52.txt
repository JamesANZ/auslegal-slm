STATEMENT OF REASONS
an Application dated 3 August 2020, Ms HOF (‘the Applicant’) sought
a Review of an Enduring Power of Attorney and that
a new attorney or
administrator be appointed for her mother, Ms GNE (‘The
Donor is 97 years old and currently lives in a residential aged care facility in
Northern Tasmania (‘the RACF’).
She has four children:
an Enduring Power of Attorney dated 14
May 2002 (‘the
EPoA’), the Donor appointed her children, Mr QE and Ms TC jointly to be
her attorneys. The EPoA was registered
with the Recorder of Titles on 9 July
to October 2015, the Donor had lived on a farming property in Northern Tasmania
that had been left to Mr QE and Mr XE by their
late father (the Donor’s
husband) in his will. In October 2015, the Donor went to live with her
granddaughter and the granddaughter
was paid for board and lodging from the
income of the Donor.
November 2018, the Donor commenced living at the RACF and fees were paid from
her income. As will be seen from what appears below,
those fees were initially
incorrectly calculated and they exceeded the total of the Donor’s income,
thereby depleting her savings.
That resulted in Mr QE having discussions with
the Applicant which are also referred to below.
Applicant lives in Victoria and the Donor’s other three children live in
Northern Tasmania. Ms TC lives in a house owned
by the Donor and pays her mother
an attachment to her Application, the Applicant stated the following under the
heading ‘[w]hat concerns have motivated you
to make this
application?’
1. Insufficient funds
2. Conflict of Interest
3. Relocation for easier visiting
In late 2019 my brother QE notified me that our mothers' funds were running
low. Her DVA pension was not covering her aged care cost.
A short fall of
$240.00 per week. A discussion took place between myself and my brother QE, it
was initially decided that each family
member would contribute $60.00 each to
cover mum's costs. However, our two other siblings declined this proposal. My
sister TC, stating
no funds available, and my brother stating that our
mother’s assets should cover expenses.
On seeking legal advice, I was advised also not to contribute. As in a
roundabout way I would be paying my sisters rent.
My sister TC residing in [residential address] being our mother’s
asset. The rent I believe $90 to $110 per week and obtaining
a rent subsidy from
Centrelink. Monies being deposited into one of my mother's bank accounts at
MyState Financial.
It is my understanding that my brother QE made good monies so our mothers
(sic) care would not be affected.
Since my mother has been in-care I have asked that our mothers (sic) Bank
Statements be available to determine where insufficient
I have also asked powers of attorneys QE and TC for my mother to be relocated
from [residential aged care facility] to Launceston
making it easier for all
family members to be able to visit. Myself and my family having to travel from
Victoria. To which both requests
have been declined.
I feel that an in depend (sic) authority look into my mother's affairs to see
exactly what is taking place.
Guardianship and Administration Board (‘the Board’) dismissed the
Application on 30 September 2020.
Statement of Reasons request in relation to the Board’s Order was received
by the Board on 2 October 2020.
The hearing
Board heard the Application on 30 September 2020 and due to COVID-19
restrictions, the hearing was held by way of a telephone
conference. Those who
attended by telephone were:
HOF - the Applicant;
– joint attorney;
TC - joint attorney;
– The Donor’s grand-daughter;
Michelle Spicer – Office of the Public Trustee.
Board had before it the following documents:
Application dated 3 August 2020, including a typed attachment setting out the
concerns that motivated the Applicant to make the
application (‘the
attached statement’).
hand-written statement signed by the Donor and witnessed on 29 April
Health Care Professional Report by Dr T Mooney dated 31 August
EPoA dated 14 May 2002;
property report from the LIST;
Handwritten
notations by Mr QE on a copy of a letter sent to him by a GAB Case Assessment
Officer dated 8 September 2020, which included
copies of the Donor’s bank
statements (Commonwealth Bank and MyState Bank) and copies of statements of
account from the RACF;
undated submission by Ms MN, including statements in relation to expenditure on
behalf of the Donor and documents from [residential
aged care facility] about
fees at the RACF;
undated submission by Ms TC, including assorted financial statements.
Legislation
formal requirements for the creation of a valid Enduring Power of Attorney are
set out in section 30 of the
Powers of Attorney Act
(‘the Act’).
powers of the Board to make orders in relation to an Enduring Power of Attorney
are set out in section 33 of the Act. Under that
section the Board may,
, do any of the following:
the Application for Review;
a term or power conferred by the EPoA;
a substitute attorney;
that the EPoA is invalid because the Donor did not have the mental capacity to
make it, or because the EPoA did not comply
with the requirements of the Act, or
because The Donor was induced to make it by dishonesty or undue influence;
the EPoA and appoint an administrator.
The relevant written and oral evidence
her Application, the Applicant did not suggest that the EPoA was in any way
defective in relation to the formal requirements for
its creation and
registration. Neither did she suggest that her mother was unable to understand
the nature and effect of the EPoA
at the time of its execution. During the
hearing, the Applicant confirmed that she was not challenging the validity of
the EPoA executed
by her mother on 14 May 2002.
she was asked why she had made the application, the Applicant said that she had
not been happy with the response she got from
family members and she referred to
the attachment to the application that is set out at paragraph 7 above. She
said: ‘[t]hey
say there is insufficient funds whereas there should be
plenty of funds for my mother.’
lengthy discussion took place and it became apparent that the RACF fees charged
to the Donor’s account had initially been
incorrectly calculated. That
had been conceded by the RACF management, which resulted in a reduction in the
fees and, more significantly,
a refund to one of the Donor’s bank accounts
of more than $15,000 in July 2020.
Board was informed that that at the time of the hearing, the Donor had a total
of approximately $42,000 in two bank accounts and,
as a result of the reduction
in her RACF fees, that was increasing.
Applicant conceded that the Donor’s costs and expenses are now being met
from the Donor’s own income.
Donor’s granddaughter informed the Board that while the Donor was living
with her (prior to the Donor moving to the RACF),
she had been paid 75% of the
Donor’s pension. That had been recommended by the ACAT team to cover board
and lodging and care
fees not met by Calvary Care. When the Applicant was asked
if she saw a problem with the payments that had been made to the Donor’s
granddaughter, she said: ‘[n]o, I don’t. I expect my mother to pay
her own way.’
Applicant stated: ‘I feel that my sister has been living off my
mother’s assets for the last 15 years’
and she asked
‘where is the rent?’ Ms TC informed the Board that she pays rent of
$280 per fortnight to her mother.
it was put to the Applicant that Ms TC appears to be living in the property and
paying rent in accordance with what her mother
had agreed to, her response was
to say: ‘I’m not debating that. I’m saying that’s good.
She gave her a home
to live in.’
of bank statements provided to the Board appeared to confirm that Ms TC is
paying the rent regularly.
the Applicant was asked whether it was still her wish to have her mother
relocated to a different aged care facility, she said
she was not pursuing that,
in the light of the Health Care Professional Report by Dr T Mooney. She also
said that she had previously
thought that her mother might like to be in a
different facility with a friend, but that friend had since died.
Conclusions
Board concluded that the Applicant’s stated concerns did not justify the
appointment of the Public Trustee, either as a
substitute attorney or as an
administrator.
apparent insufficiency of the Donor’s funds had been rectified by a
reduction in her RACF fees and a significant refund
paid into her account. That
had occurred prior to the application being lodged with the Board.
Applicant’s sister is paying rent in accordance with an agreement made
with their mother (and the Applicant conceded that
such an agreement between
mother and daughter was appropriate).
Applicant abandoned her wish to have her mother relocated to a different aged
care facility. In any event, that is not an issue
that could be determined by
the Board when considering an Application to Review an Enduring Power of
Accordingly,
the Board Orders that:
The Application to Review Enduring Power of
Attorney XX/XXXX is dismissed.
