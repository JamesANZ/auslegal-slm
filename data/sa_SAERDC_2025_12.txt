occurred – Respondents responsible for breach – breach to be

Friday 13 June 2025 the Council shall file and serve its response to the

Submissions
Ordered by the Court, Mr Cain and Ms Cain, respectively the First Respondent and
Second Respondent, were invited to make submissions
by 30 May 2025 in respect of
firstly, the Council’s position that two months is a reasonable timeframe
for the transportable
building, the verandah/lean-to and the spa pool to be
removed from the Land and secondly, the matter of costs.
Mr Cain nor Ms Cain filed or served any submissions by the due date.
Council confirmed via an email dated 2 June 2025 that it was anticipated to file
a response if submissions were received from
Mr Cain and Ms Cain. Accordingly,
because no submissions had been received from Mr Cain or Ms Cain by the due
date, the Council
advised it had no response to
for removal
the hearing Mr De Tullio for the Council gave evidence that decommissioning and
dismantling the transportable building would likely
take one month and require a
tradesperson. It was also his evidence that the removal of the verandah-lean to
and the spa pool could
be removed from the Land within one
Council submitted in closing that a period of two months would be a reasonable
time within which to remove the transportable
building, the verandah/lean-to and
the spa pool from the Land.
the absence of any submission by Mr Cain or Ms Cain and on the basis of the
evidence before the Court as outlined in the First
Decision I determine a period
of two months is a reasonable time within which the transportable building, the
verandah/lean-to and
the spa pool must be removed from the
Court may make such orders in relation to the costs of proceedings as it thinks
This Court has routinely
upheld the general rule “costs follow the event” - i.e. the
successful party ought to be awarded
its costs in the
proceedings.
explained in the First Decision, I found that Mr Cain and Ms Cain have breached
the Act by undertaking unlawful development on
the Land by causing, suffering or
permitting a transportable building, a verandah/lean-to and a spa pool to be
erected on the land
without first obtaining the requisite development
Council has actively pursued this matter since first becoming aware of the issue
in September 2023. The Council provided the
Cains with constructive advice and
opportunities to rectify the breach, however, the breach was not rectified. It
is in this context
the Council ultimately sought recourse via this Court. The
Council actively participated in the proceedings.
am satisfied that the action of the Council was appropriate and necessary to
remedy these breaches and in the absence of any submission
from Mr Cain or Ms
Cain see no reason in this instance to depart from rule that costs follow the
