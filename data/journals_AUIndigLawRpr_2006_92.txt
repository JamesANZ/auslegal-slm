nited Nations Special Rapporteur on Adequate
Housing: Mission to Australia
Preliminary Observations

I Purpose of the Visit
At the invitation of the Government of Australia, the Special Rapporteur was
invited to visit the country with the general objectives
(a) Examining and reporting on the status of realization of the right to
adequate housing and other related rights in the country,
with particular
attention to aspects of gender equality and non-discrimination;
(b) To engage in dialogues with the Government and the civil society in their
efforts to secure these rights;
(c) To identify practical solutions and best practices in the realization of
rights related to his mandate.
The Special Rapporteur wishes to
express his gratitude for the invitation of the Government of Australia and
hopes that his mission
will contribute positively to the implementation of the
right to adequate housing in this country. He looks forward to continuing
collaboration with the Australian authorities.
6 Indigenous Peoples
The Special Rapporteur was particularly disturbed by the adverse housing
conditions in the Indigenous communities he visited.
The Indigenous communities in both urban and rural areas in all States
visited, are facing a severe housing crisis. This is occurring
with respect to
the unaffordability, the lack of appropriate support services, the significant
levels of poverty and the underlying
discrimination. Most disturbing is the
absence of adequate and comprehensive participation processes for Indigenous
communities in
decision-making forums, resulting in some cases in culturally
inadequate solutions – options such as shared responsibility
agreements,
due to heir ad hoc nature, their conditional approach, and their limitation to
individual communities, do not appear
to adequately meet this gap. There is an
urgent need to establish decision-making processes and institutions, that are
representative
of all communities, and allow for proper self-determination of
Indigenous Peoples.
He notes that the notion of ‘home’ or ‘house’ can be
differently perceived by Indigenous and non Indigenous.
Housing for Indigenous
communities necessitates a close examination of its cultural adequacy to the way
of life of these communities.
The Indigenous Peoples experience substantial discrimination in Australia
including in accessing adequate housing and private housing
market. The Special
Rapporteur notes that the so-called ‘shared responsibility
agreements’ are very likely to be discriminatory
and contrary to
international human rights standards.
The Special Rapporteur has previously reported on the indivisible
relationship between the right to land and the right to adequate
this is even more so for Indigenous communities where land is an integral part
of their cultural identity. The amendments
to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act
(Northern Territory) 1976 submitted in parliament during the Special
Rapporteur’s visit to
Australia, raise grave concerns as to the extent to
which the land rights of Indigenous peoples in the NT will be maintained.
It is important for the government to ensure that whatever measures it
introduces are not retrogressive in nature, but seek to incrementally
towards the full realisation of human rights. The Special Rapporteur notes with
concern reports he has received that there
has been insufficient consultation
with Indigenous land owners or the opportunity to provide input into this
process, particularly
on key issues such as the 99-year lease provision. Most
concerning, is the potential removal of the role of Indigenous people as
decision-makers over the use and access of the land during the lease period.
Such measures would undermine the right to self-determination
of Indigenous
Peoples in the Northern Territory and may call into question Australia’s
obligations under the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, including its provisions on self-determination.
