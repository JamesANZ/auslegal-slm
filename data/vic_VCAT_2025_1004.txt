APPEARANCES:
For Applicant

Mr M F Sharkey, counsel
10 November 2017, the applicant and the respondent entered into a building
contract (the “

to construct five townhouses at Main Road West, St Albans, Victoria (the
2 December 2019, the applicant terminated the building contract, following the
respondent’s failure to comply with a notice
to remedy served under the

Escape Homes
”) to “reconstruct and re-build [the]

deal with the respondent’s submissions below.
Respondent’s submission that Escape Homes’s
contract price was not in respect of the rectification and completion of works
required to be performed by the respondent
respondent’s amended defence dated 27 May 2022 made no allegation that the
cost claimed by the applicant to complete and
rectify the works, following the
termination of the respondent, was not necessary and reasonable. I struck out
the amended defence,
in any case, by my order dated 29 May 2024.
find that there is no material upon which the respondent now wishes to rely on
(specifically, an estimate of the respondent dated
8 May 2017 in respect of the
works, without context, filed the day before the quantum hearing) that
demonstrates on the balance of
probabilities that there was any rectification or
completion work undertaken by the applicant that was so obviously unreasonable
that it could not be said to have been part of the building
respondent’s submission that the contract price for works undertaken by
Escape Homes, following the termination of the respondent,
was not properly
incurred for the rectification and completion of works required to be performed
by the respondent is therefore rejected.
Respondent’s submission that the Telstra pits relocation
work was excluded from respondent’s scope of works, and is therefore
recoverable from the respondent.
applicant claims $81,907.35 in respect of the relocation of “the existing
telecom pit”.
find that on a proper construction of conditions 1(a), 1(d) and 1(e) of stamped
plan A01, comprising the building permit for the
development and forming part of
the building contract, and the corresponding notations appearing on the plan
(proximate to the description
MAIN ROAD WEST), I find that the respondent was
required not only to move the crossover from a westerly location at the property
to an easterly location, but also to “relocate the existing telecom
pit”. Such work was not specifically excluded from
the respondent’s
price for the works. The submission by the respondent that the Telstra pits
relocation work was excluded from
the respondent’s scope of works, and is
therefore not recoverable by the applicant as damages, is rejected.
Respondent’s submission that infrastructure provision for
NBN connection to each unit at the property was included in the contract
of Escape Homes, and therefore is not recoverable from the respondent.
applicant claims $3,306.16 in respect of the amount it paid to Sherlocks Home
Communications Pty Ltd for the “digging supply
and installation of pits
and pipes with drawstrings” associated with the provision of NBN to the
Escape Homes contract incorporated 2 pages of specifications prepared by Escape
respondent concedes it that these works were within the scope of works it was
required to perform.
am not satisfied on the evidence that, on the balance of probabilities, these
works were not included as part of the works to be
carried out by Escape Homes
for its contract price. There is no exclusion in respect of such works either in
Schedule 5 to the contract
between the applicant and Escape Homes, or in the
specifications the subject of the contract with Escape Homes.
find that the applicant is not entitled to this amount, and the
respondent’s submission is therefore upheld.
Respondent’s submission that part of the contract price
paid to Escape Homes was in respect of landscaping, which works were
excluded from the respondent’s scope of works
find that the building contract excluded landscaping from the
respondent’s scope of works, at Schedule 5.
find from special condition 20 of the building contract between the applicant
and Escape Homes and clause 9.1 of the relevant specification
that Escape Homes
was required to undertake work beyond that required in the building contract.
value that work performed by Escape Homes at

TOTAL PROVED DAMAGES
$546,275.89
find that on 1 April 2021, the applicant made a payment to Escape Homes of the
fixing stage payment in the amount of $345,000. I
find that on that date, the
applicant had paid $237,123.18 more than the amount of $1,004,876.82 which the
applicant was bound to
credit the respondent under the law of damages.
1 April 2021 to 27 October 2022, therefore, the applicant was deprived of the
use of that $237,123.18 that the respondent should
have paid the applicant. I
find that it is fair within the meaning of s53(2)(b)(ii) of the
Building Contracts Act 1958
to order the payment of interest from 1 April
2021 to 27 October 2021 being 575 days, at the rate of 10% (being the interest
fixed under
Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983
$37,355.02.
find that on 28 October 2022, the applicant made a further payment to Escape
Deducting $10,000 being
the element of the applicant’s payment that I find related to landscaping,
I find that from that date
to 14 March 2025, the applicant had paid $374,123.18
more than the amount of $1,004,876.82 for which the applicant was bound to
to the respondent under the law of damages.
28 October 2022 to 14 March 2025, the applicant has been deprived of the use of
the total amount of $374,123.18 that the respondent
should have paid the
applicant. I find that it is fair within the meaning of s53(2)(b)(ii) of the
Domestic Building Contracts Act 1958
to order the payment of further
interest on $374,123.18 from 28 October 2021 to 14 March 2025 being 869 days, at
the rate of 10%
(being the interest rate fixed under
Interest Rates Act 1983
) being $89,072.06.
find that total interest on the sum of $374,123.18 from 15 March 2025 to 12
November 2025, being 242 days, at the rate of 10% (being
the interest rate fixed
Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983
) is $24,804.87. I find
that it is fair within the meaning of s53(2)(b)(ii) of the
Domestic Building
Contracts Act 1958
to order the payment of this further
