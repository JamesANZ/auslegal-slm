Reasons for
As a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the
evidence relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for
Are the premises unsuitable for keeping the requested pet?
In the landlords’ application, it is stated that the premises are
unsuitable because there is no cat run or means to restrict
the requested pet at
the premises, and they are also concerned for local wildlife.
The RTA provides examples of why a premises may be unsuitable, such as lack of
fencing and open spaces.
cat run does not make the premises unsuitable for keeping the requested pet.
Research conducted by Consumer Protection shows the premises is a four bedroom,
two-bathroom home with a fully fenced backyard with
protection from the elements
for the requested pet.
The tenants highlight that the requested pet will be an indoor only cat and will
not pose any risk to local wildlife. I am satisfied
that the tenant has taken
the necessary measures to reduce the impact of the requested pet on local
In the tenant’s application, scratching posts and enrichment toys and
activities will be provided for the requested pet.
Considering the information from the landlords and the tenants, I am not
satisfied that the premises are unsuitable for keeping the
requested pet.
Is keeping the requested pet at the premises likely to cause damage to the
premises that could not be repaired for less than the bond?
The security bond held by the Bond Administrator for this premises is $3380
which includes a pet bond of $260.
In written submissions, the landlords stated they reside in the adjacent
premises. The landlord expressed concerns about the interaction
their dog will
have with the requested pet when the animals are unsupervised, the potential
risk of damage to their dog and to the
dividing fence.
The tenants are entitled to quiet
as per the RTA, in
regards to the landlords residing in the adjacent premises.
No evidence has been provided by the landlords to show how the requested pet
will damage the premises exceeding the security bond
In a written submission by the tenants, the requested pet will be an indoor pet,
removing the risk to the landlords’ dog and
the dividing fence. The
requested pet is house trained and litter trained.
Considering the information from the landlords and the tenants, I am not
satisfied that keeping the requested pet at the premises
is likely to cause
damage to the premises that could not be repaired for less than the bond.
Is keeping the requested pet at the premises likely to cause the landlord
undue hardship?
The term ‘undue hardship’ is not defined in the RTA.
The Macquarie Dictionary defines the terms as:
unwarranted; excessive; not proper, fitting or right; unjustified.
Hardship: a
condition that bears hard upon one; severe toil, trial, oppression or need.
The New South Wales Supreme Court has previously concluded that the phrase
“undue hardship” means “greater hardship
circumstances warrant”.
In written submissions, the landlords indicated that allowing the requested pet
to reside at the premises would result in financial
hardship because of
potential risk of damage to the property. The landlords advised the house is
newly renovated (carpet cost $5300
and window treatments cost $2910) and
mentioned a potential risk of damage to the fence.
The landlord has submitted in writing that they only approved the tenants to
have a dog when they initially moved into the premises.
The RTA by outlining the tenants’ responsibilities:
the tenant shall
not intentionally or negligently cause or
permit damage to
the premises.
The RTA similarly outlines tenant responsibilities for keeping a pet:
the tenant is
responsible for nuisance caused by a pet, and
repairing damage
caused by a pet.
No evidence was provided by the landlords to show that the requested pet at the
premises would likely cause the landlords undue hardship.
No evidence was provided by the landlords to show that the requested pet at the
premises would likely cause the landlords undue hardship.
Considering the information from the landlords and the tenants, I am not
satisfied that keeping the requested pet at the premises
is likely to cause the
landlord undue hardship.
