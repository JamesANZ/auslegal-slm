LEGISLATION CITED:
ss. 170 &175
Anti-Discrimination Act
after 10.00 am on 30 July 2007, the Complainant, Essam Mohamed Mahmoud
El Mansy, a disabled pensioner, was travelling on a
number 598 Brisbane City
Council Bus driven by the first respondent Terry Lane.
was seated in a seat that he said in his original complaint to the
Anti-Discrimination Commission filed on 14 November 2007, was
reserved for
disabled passengers directly behind the driver facing inwards. As the bus
driver drove off the Gateway Bridge into
Fison Avenue Eagle Farm a small utility
truck passed through a stop sign on the driver’s right (i.e. behind
Mr El Mansy and
out of his view).
avoid a collision Mr Lane braked violently. Ms El Mansy was flung
forward by the braking; he suffered serious personal injury
which is variously
described as an exacerbation of a pre-existing cervical spondylosis (see report
of Dr Gatehouse 8 August 2008)
or a neck injury with referred
symptomatology to the right upper limb and minor rotator cuff
irritation/bursitis (see report of Dr
Gillett 11 November 2008).
Mansy is presently seeking damages for personal injury from the Brisbane City
Council and the Nominal Defendant arising from
this incident. This Tribunal is
not the place to dwell on the likely result of such a claim. Rather it is
Mr El Mansy’s treatment
at the scene of the accident by Mr Lane
which is the subject of the present complaint.
Mansy is of Arabic descent. He is dark skinned and slightly balding in
appearance. On 28 March 2003 he suffered a serious
injury to his brain
(described as a frontal haematoma of the brain). His forehead bears scars
either from his injury or surgery
following that injury. He suffers
significantly from this injury. He alleges that his symptomatology including
migraine headaches
and aggressive behaviours has become exacerbated by the
discrimination he alleges (as well I assume as from his personal injury).
the facts relevant to the complaint are not substantially contraverted. There
were five passengers on the Bus at the time
of the incident. Mr Lane
stopped the bus and asked if anyone was hurt. There was but one reply from a
Ms Hopson seated towards
the rear of the bus. Mr Lane took up his
notebook and went to speak to Ms Hopson.
asked Ms Hopson and another woman seated near or next to her whether they
would like the assistance of an ambulance or paramedic.
They declined.
Mr Lane then took down Ms Hopson’s details and completed a
“Bus Incident Report”. Ms Hopson had
cut her hand and had a
bruised right knee. Mr Lane then took down Ms Maugeri’s
details. She however declined to have a “Bus
Incident Report”
prepared as she had sustained only a bruised left knee.
other male passengers were seated at the rear of the bus. Both assured
Mr Lane upon his inquiry they were not injured. Mr Lane
“I then turned and walked back up to the front of the
bus to return to my seat. I did not ignore Mr El Mansy; however I saw
reason to speak to him. He had not responded to my query as to whether anyone
was injured immediately after the incident and
he did not appear to be injured.
Further, I knew that unlike the female passengers at the centre of the bus that
had been thrown
forwards, thereby hurting their knees on the chair in front of
them, Mr El Mansy had been in a chair facing into the middle of the
could not have fallen very far.
Mr El Mansy approached me and asked me a question with words to the
effect ‘Are you taking down names of people who have been
I asked him whether he was injured and he advised me that he was. I asked
Mr El Mansy to tell me where he was injured
and he told me that his
shoulder was hurt.
I then asked Mr El Mansy to do a series of exercises, and after each
exercise I asked him whether it hurt to do the exercise. After
each exercise,
he advised me that it did not hurt to do the exercise.
I did not write down Mr El Mansy’s details, or complete a Bus
Incident Report for him as he did not appear to be injured and
he did not have
difficulty moving his shoulder.
I did however advise Mr El Mansy to see a doctor if he experienced any
pain. I also advised him to contact the Brisbane City Council
if he wished to
make a complaint.”
Mansy similarly says:
“The driver stopped the bus and went to
the rear of the bus where the four other passengers in the bus were sitting.
was a couple, and a lady and a young man. These passengers all looked
like there were of Anglo-Celtic descent. The driver asked
the couple if they
were okay, the lady said she had a cut between her fingers and she showed him
the bleeding. The man with this
lady said he was okay. Then the bus driver
asked the single lady, and she said she had a bruise on her knee. The driver
was writing
down names of passengers. The driver asked the young man if he was
okay, and the young man said he was okay.
Then the bus driver came back towards his seat and was about to get back into
his seat. He completely ignored me, as though I wasn’t
there. I said
‘excuse me’ to him. I asked him ‘do you think you should
write my name down?’ The driver
asked ‘why’? I told him what
happened and he asked me to close my arm and open it. As I did this, I felt
elbow and shoulder. The driver said ‘no, there is no problem
you are okay’ and he got back in his seat and drove the
I felt very sad and disappointed to be treated as though I did not
the time of a recent directions hearing it appeared common ground that
Mr El Mansy was treated differently and less favourably
to the other bus
passengers:
(a) he was not
offered the assistance of an ambulance or paramedic despite his injury;
(b) no offer to
take down his details or complete a “Bus Incident Report” was
(c) no inquiry
addressed whether they “spoke up”
(d) no other
passenger was required to demonstrate by a series of exercises whether or not
they were injured as they claimed;
(e) no other
passengers’ claim of any injury was contraverted.
Mr Lane’s filed statement it seems more than arguable that a person
with his back to an oncoming emergency with no opportunity
to brace himself
might suffer a serious whiplash type injury whereas other passengers facing
forward able to see the possible collision
and brace, may not be seriously hurt
in the same incident.
complaint was accepted by the Commission as one of discrimination on the basis
of race. Mr El Mansy simply contends the fair
inference from the alleged
conduct was (whether conscious or unconscious) racial discrimination. He unlike
other passengers was
not to be accepted as a truthful or reliable witness to his
own injury. That is a not an unknown stereotypical view of non European
Australians often the subject of complaints before this Tribunal.
Mansy now wishes to contend the discrimination was also based on his disability
– he was, he says, seated in a seat for
disabled passengers and the scars
on his forehead showing his head injury which gave rise to his disability were
plainly visible.
complaint included the assertion he was seated in a reserved seat for disabled
people. The complaint has been referred to and
accepted by the Tribunal: cf
Anti-Discrimination Act
of the Act allows amendments albeit that section has been interpreted
narrowly: cf
Hopper v Mt Isa Mines
[1999] 2 Qd R 496

my opinion I am not confined to dealing with the matter as being based upon the
attribute of race. The Commission assessed the
complaint as an allegation of
race discrimination in the areas of goods and services and state laws and
programs. The Tribunal however,
is not bound by the Commission’s
characterisation of the complaint. (
Wilson & McCollum v Lawson &
[2008] QADT 27
at para 101).
the facts giving rise to this allegation were raised in the complaint filed in
the Commission, these matters can be agitated in
the Tribunal without a formal
amendment of the complaint. I will however, allow Mr El Mansy to further
particularise his claim as
I have recited it above in paragraphs 10, 12 and
13. That will not delay the case nor add in any significant way to the length
a hearing. The case (if proved) most probably involves more than trifling
but less than serious misconduct. Absent the psychological
overlay alleged it
may warrant compensation of up to $5,000. Even if the psychological overlay was
established (and there is no
medical evidence to support such a claim) it may
involve compensation of $10,000: cf and cn
Sailor v Village Taxi Cabs Pty
[2004] QADT 15.
are two respondents both legally represented who I was told would be represented
by counsel at a hearing. It is at least not
uncommon in circumstances as
described above for the respondent not to obtain an order for costs even if the
complaint does not succeed.
the significant legal costs of a hearing are incurred (probably in an amount
vastly more than the worth of the claim) I have
directed that a conciliation
conference take place. I have also directed that Mr El Mansy particularise
his monetary claim and provide
any further medical evidence in support of it
given that he contends that he is entitled to very substantial compensation over
above what the facts suggested is the likely outcome. Failing settlement
the matter will be set down for a one day hearing at the
parties’ earliest
convenience. I have made directions limiting the time for presentation of each
side’s case on that
