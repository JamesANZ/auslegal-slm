REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 6 May 2025)
Executive Officer (Housing) v Pepperill
[2024] NTCA 10
this Court dismissed an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court in
Pepperill & Anor v CEO (Housing)
[2023] NTSC 90.
A notice of
contention was also dismissed.
respondents sought an order for their costs of the appeal, including their costs
of determining the issue of costs. The respondents’
position was based on
the important principle that guides the exercise of the Court’s discretion
on costs, that the successful
party is generally entitled to their
appellant argued that there should be no order as to the costs of the appeal
because the decision on the appeal ‘substantively
displaced and/or
clarified the judgment ... below in a critical respect favourable to the
appellant’.
General principles
r 63.01 of the
Supreme Court Rules 1987
(NT), the Court has a broad
discretion with respect to costs.
[5] The guiding
principle that the successful party should ordinarily be awarded its costs may
be departed from in circumstances where
a differential costs order is
appropriate.
The circumstances in
which such an order may be appropriate include where: (a) in respect of one or
more issues, the successful
party has ‘unfairly, improperly or
unnecessarily increased the costs’, including unreasonably pursuing or
with points which have no merit; (b) the bulk of the time has been
taken on an issue on which the unsuccessful party has succeeded,
even if the
successful party has not acted unreasonably in raising those issues; and/or (c)
where a particular issue or group of
issues is clearly dominant or separable,
and the application of the general rule may involve hardship on a losing party
nevertheless succeeded on that issue or group of
Whether or not such
circumstances are characterised as
required to depart from the guiding principle is circumstances where a
differential costs order is appropriate.
The parties’
appellant submitted that the protracted and unusual procedural history of this
matter, and this Court’s conclusions
that a landlord’s obligation
Residential Tenancies Act 1999
(‘RTA’) is to take reasonable steps to ensure that premises or
ancillary property are habitable (relevant to which
are questions as to the
nature and degree of the risk to or impacts upon the health, safety and/or
reasonable comfort of the tenants,
the measures available to the landlord to
alleviate the risks or impacts, the capacity and power of the landlord to
control or address
those risks or impacts and the nature and extent of any
expertise or special skill
endorsed the approach
taken by the Northern Territory Civil and Administrative Tribunal on review, and
rejected the approach taken
by the Court below. Consequently, it was argued that
despite the appeal being dismissed, the respondents’ position in the
was not vindicated any more than the appellant’s position in the
respondents argued that the practical
of the proceeding was that
its legal challenge in the Supreme Court was upheld by this Court with the
matter remitted to the Tribunal
for determination in accordance with the
Court’s decision.
No warrant for departure from the general
[8] The order
made by this Court was to dismiss the appeal but vary the order made by the
Supreme Court remitting the matter back
to the Tribunal for determination in
accordance with the Supreme Court’s judgment, particularly at paragraph
[47], requiring
the Tribunal to determine the matter in accordance with this
Court’s judgment rather than the Supreme Court’s judgment.
judgment, this Court concluded, contrary to the submissions of the appellant,
that the Supreme Court had made no errors
in concluding that:
(a) If running water were not supplied to the respondent tenants’
premises, they would not be habitable within the meaning
Section 48(1)(a)
of the RTA obliges the appellant to ensure that running
water is supplied to the respondent tenants’
(c) The quality of the water which the appellant permits to be supplied to the
premises is a habitability issue, and the appellant
is obliged to ensure that
the water supplied by the Power and Water Corporation is safe to drink because
it is a matter of health
(d) Whether the premises were not habitable, and whether the appellant took
reasonable steps to ensure the habitability of the premises
are yet to be
determined by the Tribunal.
(e) The Tribunal erred in law in holding that the quality of the drinking water
supplied to the respondent tenants’ premises
was not an issue of
habitability for the purposes of
variation of the order remitting the matter back to the Tribunal for
determination of the tenants’ applications was
made because this Court had
determined the appeal.
[11] It follows
that the appellant cannot be said to have had any significant measure of success
in this appeal from the decision
of the Supreme Court that warrants a departure
from the general principle that the successful party should be awarded its
Disposition
[12] We make the
following orders:
appellant is to pay the respondents’ costs of the appeal, including the
costs of determining the issue of
