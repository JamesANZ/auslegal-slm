STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
Dinkha, the claimant, was injured in a motor accident on 18 October 2021. The
insurer accepted the applicant’s claim, under
Motor Accident
Injuries Act 2017
claimant brought an application for the determination of a merit review matter
under Schedule 2, clause 1 (a) of the Act.
dispute between the parties pertains to the amount of weekly benefits payable
under Division 3.3 of the Act regarding the calculation
of the Claimant’s
pre-accident average weekly earnings (PAWE). The amount of PAWE affects the
amount of weekly payments of
statutory benefits payable under Division 3.3 of
the Act (weekly payments of statutory benefits for injured persons).
issue for determination can be very shortly stated: that is, whether the
claimant’s PAWE was correctly calculated by the
insurer at the minimum
statutory amount for the first 13 weeks or should be calculated at $1,000 gross
per week as contended for
by the claimant.
a decision dated 28 June 2022, the respondent determined that the
applicant’s pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE) are nil.
dispute was referred to the Personal Injury Commission (the Commission).
Reviewer Ruschen conducted a merit review and issued a certificate dated 25
November 2022, affirming the insurer’s decision
dated 28 June
applicant sought to have the determination of Merit Reviewer Ruschen reviewed on
the basis that it was incorrect in a material
respect. The review application
was accepted and was referred to this Review Panel as constituted under 7.15 of
the Act (the Panel).
claimant claims he was employed by La Ho Pty Ltd on a casual basis.
28 June 2022 the insurer conceded that the claimant was an earner however was
not earning continuously on the day of the accident
his work trial having
completed on 16 October 2021.
the claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 18 October
The relevant 12-month period was 18 October 2020 to 17 October 2021.
a signed statement dated 20 December 2021, the claimant stated he was employed
by Mr La Ho as a painter’s labourer/assist
for two (2) weeks in October
2021 and was paid $2,000 gross. He was employed for a trial period from 4
to 16 October 2021. The claimant’s
bank statement showed that he received
the payment of $2,000 on 22 October 2021, said to be the payment of wages for
the trial period
working for Mr La Ho. This evidence has been accepted by the
parties as comprising the relevant facts.
RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS
Relevantly,
s 3.6 of the Act provides that “[a]n earner who was injured as a result of
a motor accident and suffers a total
or partial loss of earnings as a result of
the injuries entitled to weekly payments and statutory benefits under this
section during
the first entitlement period.” Subsection 3.6(2) of
the Act provides that a weekly payment of statutory benefits under this
is to be at a rate of 95% of the difference between the person’s
pre-accident weekly earnings and the person’s
post-accident earning
capacity (if any) or post-accident earnings, whichever is the greater, for the
first entitlement period.
1, clause 1 of the Act, provides that the words and expressions to find in the
Schedule apply to the purposes of s 3.3 of
the Act. Relevantly, clause 3
provides that “loss of earnings” means a loss incurred or likely to
be incurred in a person’s
income from personal exertion. A
income from personal exertion
(a) the amount that is the income of the person consisting of earnings,
salaries, wages, commissions, fees, bonuses, pensions, retiring
allowances and
retiring gratuities, allowances and gratuities received in the capacity of
employee or in relation to any services
rendered, and
(b) the proceeds of any business carried on by the person either alone or in
partnership with any other person, and
(c) any amount received as bounty or subsidy in carrying on a business.
income from personal exertion
(a) interest, unless the person’s principal business consists of the
lending of money, or unless the interest is received in
respect of a debt due to
the person for goods supplied or services rendered by the person in the course
of the person’s business,
(b) rents or dividends, or
(c) any employer superannuation contributions, or
(d) the monetary amount of any annual, sick or other leave entitlement.
Pre-accident
weekly earnings is defined by Clause 4, Schedule 1 of the Act. Sub-clauses 1 and
2. Relevantly, pre-accident weekly earnings,
in relation to an earner who is
injured as a result of a motor accident, means the weekly average of the gross
earnings received
by an earner as an earner during the 12 months immediately
before the day on which the motor accident occurred, unless subclause
applies (which does not apply here.) If, on the day of the motor accident, the
earner was earning continuously, but had not been
earning continuously for at
least 12 months- the weekly average of the gross earnings received by the earner
as an earner during
the period from when the earner started to earn continuously
to immediately before the day of the motor accident.
SUBMISSIONS
Insurer’s submissions
insurer accepts that the claimant was employed as painter’s assistant in
the 2 weeks immediately preceding the motor accident,
on a trial basis. The
$2,000 payment for the work trial was paid on 22 October 2021, which is after
the date of the motor accident
on 18 October 2021. It submits that as the
earnings for the work trial were not received before the accident, they are to
be excluded
from the calculation of PAWE under Schedule 1 (4)(1). Therefore, it
submits that as the claimant did not receive any earnings during
the period 18
October 2020 to 17 October 2021 the claimant’s PAWE is nil in which case
he is entitled to be paid the minimum
weekly statutory benefits less his
post-accident earning capacity (if any) under 3.6 and 3.7 of the
Claimant’s submissions
claimant submits that the provision, properly construed, does not require the
payment and physical receipt of money by the claimant
prior to the accident but
rather requires an entitlement to be paid for work performed by the claimant.
He relies on the approach
to statutory construction as set out by Garling J in
Thiering v Daly
[2011] NSWSC 1345
a) An express object of the Act is “to provide early and ongoing financial
support for persons injured in motor accidents”:
s1.3(b) of the Act.
b) The Act also expressly provides: “In the interpretation of a provision
of this Act or the regulations, a construction that
would promote the objects of
this Act or the provision is to be preferred to a construction that would not
promote those objects.”:
s 1.3 (4) of the Act.
construction preferred by the insurer and adopted by the Merit Reviewer renders
a claimant vulnerable to factors beyond their
control. For example, an employer
who simply fails to pay wages as and when required, or a pay cycle imposed by an
employer that
may be periodic and lengthy, such as monthly or longer, or even a
banking error that sees the money diverted to an unintended
d) The provision in its own terms recognises that a claimant may have been
engaged in paid work for a short period prior to being
injured in an accident
and provides nevertheless for those earnings to inform the calculation of
pre-accident weekly earnings, a
purpose not achieved by the narrow, strict, and
literal construction adopted by the Merit Reviewer.
e) The objects of the Act and the avoidance of patently unintended or absurd
results are all achieved by the rejection of the construction
adopted by the
Merit Reviewer and the adoption of the construction submitted by the claimant.
construed, the relevant statutory provisions are focused on income earned in the
relevant twelve-month period, which is any
income that a person receives from
personal exertion in that period. It can include wages, tips, salary,
commissions, or bonuses.
It is different from unearned income, which is derived
from things like investments or government benefits.
relevant statutory purpose of the provisions is to provide compensation payments
to a person injured in a motor vehicle accident
in the form of a statutory
benefit on account of past economic loss occasioned by loss of earnings or
deprivation or impairment of
earning capacity: see s 4.5(1)(a) of the Act.
is through this prism that the expression “received” is to be
properly construed as the compensation afforded a person
for their personal
exertion. As is particularly evident from the textual meaning of the expression
as conveyed by its use in of
Schedule 1, clause 3(2)(a) and (c) of the Act,
“received” is not intended to convey actual receipt of monies but
act of exchange of payment for an earner’s personal exertion. This
construction is consistent with the objects of the Act
to provide early and
ongoing financial support for persons injured in motor accidents: s 1.3(2)(b) of
this case the claimant “received” as payment for his personal
exertion $1,000 a week for two continuous weeks in the
twelve-month period prior
to the accident. While he was paid his earnings following the expiry the
relevant twelve-month period,
he “received” this payment in exchange
for his personal exertion within the relevant twelve-month period.
Accordingly,
the Panel is satisfied that the amount of statutory benefits that is payable
under Division 3.3 (Weekly payments of statutory
benefits to injured persons),
is $1,000 a week.
