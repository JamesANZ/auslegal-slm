Response provided by State Growth received 19 February 2025.
In response to these recommendations, State Growth is currently progressing the below two actions as a priority:
Resealing the curve with nonslip asphalt
*A 1.6 km section of Frankford Road, which includes the location of the crash, has been added as a priority to this season's resurfacing
program, with the works scheduled to take place in early 2025.
*This is expected to significantly mitigate potential safety issues at this site.
*Placing a "slippery when wet" advisory sign near the start of the curve warning westbound traffic;
*There are existing slippery when wet signs located on Frankford Road, however the department is reviewing the locations of these
signs and will ensure there are effectively placed signs in this section of the road, pending the completion of the resealing works.
The recommendation to place a 35 km/h advisory speed sign at the start of the curve has been assessed by State Growth's relevant technical
The use of an advisory speed sign in conjunction with a curve warning sign is determined in accordance with the methodology set out
in Appendix F of Australian Standard, AS1742, Part 2: Traffic control devices for general use. Applying this methodology to the subject
curve found that a 55 km/h advisory speed is appropriate at this location and arrangements have been made this signage installed.
Although approaching motorists currently have good forward sight distance to the curve in question, arrangements have also been made
to further improve driver awareness of this curve by installing additional signage in the form of chevron alignment markers (CAMs)
on the outside of the curve for both directions of travel. This will make it easier for motorists to perceive the road layout and
assist them in their decision making.
Installing audible painted edge lines throughout the length of the curve was also assessed though is not proposed to be installed
as the road as is not wide enough for the installation of edge lines (audible or non-audible) and the existing double centreline
marking meets the required design guidelines.
