Issue for determination
applicant’s outstanding concerns on external review are limited to the
issue of missing information, specifically documents
which he says should have
been provided by the insurer to the Department, or created by the Department, as
referred to in the Transcript.

determinations about the Department’s
complaint handling processes including how it obtains information from an
insurer when
dealing with a complaint of this nature. Similarly, it is outside
the scope of this external review for OIC to make any findings

Notwithstanding
the applicant’s broader concerns, the issue for determination in this
external review is whether access to further
documents may be refused on the
basis they do not exist. Based on the information set out in the preceding
paragraphs, I am satisfied
that the Department has conducted searches in
locations where it would be reasonable to expect documents relevant to the
application
to be found. I also find that making inquiries with the relevant
departmental officer was an appropriate avenue to pursue in the
circumstances,
as that officer had been directly involved in dealing with the applicant’s
complaint regarding the insurer and
could reliably comment on whether further
documents had been received or created. In the circumstances, I am unable to
identify any
further searches that would be reasonable for the Department to
