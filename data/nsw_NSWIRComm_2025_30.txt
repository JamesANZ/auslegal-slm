decision deals with consent applications to vary the Public Health System
Nurses’ and Midwives’ (State) Award 2023
(PHS Award) and the Crown
Employees Nurses’ (State) Award 2023 (Crown Award) (together, the
Health Secretary and New South Wales Nurses and Midwives’ Association
(Association) are currently before a Full Bench of
the Commission in an
arbitration hearing to make two new Awards, namely the Public Health System
Nurses’ and Midwives’
(State) Award 2024 and the Crown Employees
Nurses’ (State) Award 2024.
up to the arbitration, the Health Secretary agreed to certain claims of the
Association that were described as “non
cost” award changes. On 4
September 2025 the parties reached agreement as to three further changes to the
awards. The first
change is a 3% interim increase in salaries and salary related
allowances from 1 July 2025 whilst the balance of the parties’
claims are being determined through arbitration. Second, the Association’s
claim for an increase in the night shift penalties
was settled by an agreed
increase from 15% to 20%, avoiding the need for that issue to be determined in
the current proceedings.
Third, additional entitlements for union officials to
undertake certain union functions during work time have been agreed.
applications to vary the Awards by consent were filed by the Health Secretary on
8 October 2025 and give effect to the parties’
agreement on those
applications to vary the Awards are accompanied by an affidavit affirmed on 8
October 2025 by Ms Elizabeth Allen, the Director
of Industrial Relations and
Management, Workplace Relations at the NSW Ministry of Health who provides the
following evidence as
to the specific changes to the PHS Award:
“a. Insertion of a new subclause (e) to Clause 4(xiv), which provides
conditions around the rostering of night duty prior to
the day that annual leave
b. Amendment to existing Clause 4(xvi) to provide additional conditions around
the rostering of consecutive days off.
c. Amendment to existing Clause 8(iii) to provide an additional condition that
should be met prior to a roster being changed;
d. Amendment to existing Clause 15(i) with text providing for an increase in the
night duty penalty rate from 15% to 20% effective
from the first full pay period
commencing on or after 1 July 2025;
e. Amendments to the wording in Clause 54. A. prior to the conditions in
subclauses (i)–(vi) to provide that subclause (vi)
will not have effect
prior to the date of the roster publish on or after 1 November 2025 and do not
apply to any roster published
prior to 1 November 2025;
f. Amendment to existing Clause 54. A. (v) to provide enhanced provisions and
circumstances in relation to union presentations at
staff induction sections.
g. Amendment to existing clause 54. A. (vi) to provide enhanced provision of
rostered time for elected Association Officials for
the purposes of distributing
official association publications and holding discussions with employees in the
workplace; and
h. Amendment to existing Clause 54. F. (ii) to provide provisions around the
display of union noticeboards in the workplace.”
deposed that the proposed variations to the Crown Award are:
(1) a 3% increase in salaries and salary related allowances for all employees
covered by the Crown Award, effective from 1 July 2025,
(2) an amendment to cl 6(b)(i) to increase the night shift penalty to 20%.
Consideration
light of the evidence, I determine that it is appropriate to approve the consent
application and to vary the Awards pursuant to
Relations Act 1996
(NSW) (Act) in the terms sought, on the basis that the
varied Awards will set fair and reasonable conditions of employment on an
Allen deposed that the varied Awards provide for equal rates of pay and
allowances, eligibility criteria for employment, duties,
and conditions of
employment for men and women under each job classification, evidence I rely on
in respect of the matters required
to be considered under
of the Act.
am also satisfied that it is in the public interest to vary the Awards, having
regard to the objects of the Act. The agreed salary
increase is made by way of a
variation to the Awards in circumstances where the Full Bench is considering
whether there ought to
be further changes in remuneration and other conditions,
and on the agreed basis that the Association can continue to press its case
that regard. In circumstances where the current case is not expected to be
finalised before early 2026, it is appropriate that
there be an interim increase
in the meantime and, relying on the consent of the parties, I am satisfied that
it is appropriate for
the interim increase to be 3%.
note that the salary increase to the Awards is in the amount budgeted by the NSW
Government. Accordingly, I accept Ms Allen’s
evidence that she does not
expect the Awards as varied to adversely affect the fiscal position or outlook
of the NSW Government nor
the NSW economy, notwithstanding the quantum of the
increased expenditure.
the variations to the Awards are made by consent and are sought in the context
of an industrial dispute notified to the Commission
prior to 1 July 2025, they
may apply retrospectively pursuant to
order that:
(1) Pursuant to
Industrial Relations Act 1996
Awards are to be varied in the terms set out in Schedule 1 of both applications
filed by the Health Secretary on 23 October
2025, with specific clauses
taking effect on the different operative dates as particularised in the Health
Secretary’s application
and set out in the relevant award clauses.
24 October 2025 - Order 1 amended pursuant to r 36.17 of the Uniform Civil
Procedure Rules 2005 (the “slip” rule) and
r 9.4 of the
Relations Commission Rules 2022
, due to the parties jointly informing the
Commission of unintended errors, including calculation errors, in the
application filed
by the Health Secretary on 8 October 2025 which were corrected
in the Awards sent to my chambers on 23 October 2025. Corrections
(a) the rates of expense-related allowances at items 10–17 of Table 2
in the PHS Award,

Nurse/Midwife’ in their sixth year of service in the Crown Award,
(c) references to case numbers in the tables atop the first page of both the
PHS Award and Crown Award.
24 October 2025 - Order 1 at [12] updated to accord with the amendment to
