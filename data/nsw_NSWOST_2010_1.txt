Particulars:
include the particulars for Complaints One, Two
and Three and also that on 26 February 2003 the NSW Chiropractors and Osteopaths
Tribunal found the osteopath, then also a registered chiropractor guilty of
professional misconduct as a chiropractor. The Tribunal
found that he failed to
maintain professional boundaries and had entered into a personal and sexual
relationship with a patient in
or about August 1997.

probabilities that the subject-matter of the complaint has been proved.

profession.”’

at 201-202,
the High Court said:
‘Although it is sometimes referred to as the
‘penalty of disbarment’ it must be emphasised that a disbarring
is in no sense punitive in character. When such an order is made, it is
made, from the public point of view, for the protection
of those who require
protection, and from the professional point of view, in order that abuse of
privilege may not lead to loss of
privilege.’
10. The respondent, Graham Neil Austin, was born on 1 March 1947. He was awarded
a Diploma from the Sydney College of Chiropractic
and Osteopathy in 1972 and
commenced practice as a chiropractor and osteopath in 1977. He was registered in
NSW in 1979 with the
Chiropractors and Osteopaths Board.
Chiropractors and Osteopaths Tribunal (NSW) (as it then was) made a finding of
professional misconduct against the respondent
on 12 March 2003 for failing to
maintain professional boundaries with a patient and entering into a sexual
relationship with her.
2003 the respondent moved to Victoria with his second wife. He commenced
practice as a chiropractor in Victoria until 2008 when
he was convicted of
offences which were particularized in Complaint One currently before the
Tribunal. For count 2 he was sentenced
to 20 months imprisonment, 7 months non
parole, and a further 18 months on good behaviour bond. For count 1 he received
a good behaviour
bond for 18 months and count 3 a good behaviour bond for 3
June 2005 his registration as a chiropractor in NSW expired because of
non-payment of fees. In 2008 the he was refused re-registration
to the Register
of Chiropractors in NSW on the basis his was unfit to practice. His appeal to
the Chiropractors Tribunal resulted
in a finding that he was not of good
character and not fit to practice as a chiropractor. The appeal was dismissed.
was suspended from registration by the Osteopaths’ Registration Board in
May 2008 and his application for re-registration
in April 2009 was refused.
Circumstances surrounding the complaints
29 October 2007 the respondent pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent
assault: (1) Between 31 December 1980 and 15 February
1981 he assaulted a female
under the age of 16 years being 11 or 12 years and committed an act of indecency
upon her (2) Between
1 October 1981 and 6 October 1981 he assaulted a female
under the age of 16 years namely 12 years and committed an act of indecency
her (3) Between 30 November 1988 and 1 January 1989 he assaulted a female and
committed an act of indecency upon her. Two further
matters on Form 1 were taken
into account for count 2.
relevant facts were agreed upon. Judge Murrell described the circumstances in
her sentencing report of 17 January 2008. The victim
was the daughter of the
offender’s former wife whom he married in 1974 when the victim was 5 years
old. Their relationship
was turbulent. They separated on a number of occasions
between 1988 and 1998, and were divorced in 2000. The victim regarded the
offender as her father. During the periods of the complaints there were a number
of occasions when the offender committed indecent
acts against her, including
kissing, touching her breast, and touching her near the vagina. The offences on
the indictment and the
Form 1 were not isolated incidents but representative of
a broader course of conduct.
1990 after disclosure by the victim, the victim, her mother and the respondent
attended counselling with a psychiatrist to address
these issues. The respondent
and the victim’s mother again received counselling in 1999 from 2
psychiatrists where the respondent
made admissions regarding his abuse.
2003 the Chiropractors Board found a complaint of professional misconduct
against the respondent for entering into a personal and
sexual relationship with
a patient thereby failing to maintain appropriate professional boundaries.
Honour noted that the victim was a vulnerable person and Mr Austin [the
respondent] abused his position of authority and trust
with respect to the only
person in relation to whom he had ever stood in loco parentis. Her Honour also
noted that Mr. Austin offered
his ‘turbulent and sexually unsatisfying
relationship’ with the [victim’s] mother as an explanation for his
Her Honour remarked that she found Mr. Austin’s explanation of
his conduct to be ‘offensive’ and ‘demonstrating
insight and a lack of acceptance of fundamental responsibility for the conduct
in question’. However the judge had
favourable regard for Mr.
Austin’s counselling and considered he had dealt with the issues and was
fully rehabilitated.
the 15 May 2007 the respondent then a registered osteopath in NSW, submitted an
application for renewal of registration with the
NSW Osteopaths Registration
Board. In this document he declared there were no ‘criminal proceedings
against him for a sex/violence
offence alleged to have been committed against a
minor’; when in fact he had been arrested and charged on the 11 July 2006.
On October 29 2007, he pleaded guilty to the three counts discussed above. As a
consequence, his registration as an osteopath was
the 24 June 2008 he was sentenced by Judge Murrell in the District Court with 20
months incarceration, 7 months being the non parole
period and a further 18
months on good behaviour bond for the most serious count. For the other 2 counts
he received good behaviour
bonds for 18 months and 3 years consecutively.
2003 the respondent was reprimanded by the Chiropractors and Osteopaths Tribunal
for being guilty of professional misconduct in
that he entered into a personal
and sexual relationship with a patient and sought to continue his treatment
following the commencement
of the relationship.
Evidence of the respondent.
a letter to the Tribunal the respondent explained that due to financial
pressures he was unable to give evidence either in person
or by phone, then
after some indecision as to whether he would appear to give oral evidence, he
eventually made himself available
by telephone conference. In light of the
respondent’s explanation, no weight was given to his inability to attend
respondent provided the Tribunal with a letter and several documents which are
found in Exhibit 3, 4 & 1 (Tab 33). His letter
was confusing on some
he said he was in agreement with each of the 4 complaints and to the particulars
of each. He also said he was in full agreement
with the decision of the
Chiropractors and Osteopaths Tribunal in 12 March 2003, the agreement of Judge
Murrell 17 January 2008 and
Chiropractor’s Tribunal 9 September 2009.
However he then contradicts that statement later in the letter.
he was being cross examined he clearly did not agree with the decisions. The
Tribunal found the respondent was not a credible
witness. He was repetitive,
confusing and contradictory and was often evasive. On some issues he appeared to
give self-serving rather
than truthful answers.
Complaint One
respondent was convicted of offences in NSW the circumstances of which render
him unfit in the public interest to practise as
an Osteopath. The Tribunal must
be comfortably satisfied that the respondent’s convictions render him
unfit to practise.
cross examination the respondent asserted that not only was he not guilty of
most of the charges for which he had pleaded guilty,
but he also claimed the
victim was the instigator for the 2 counts when she was under 16. His version
was different to those set
out in the statement of agreed facts.
count 1 the agreed facts were that when the complainant was aged 11 she
approached the offender while he was working on his car
in the garage. The
offender leaned down and kissed her on the lips. He put his tongue in her mouth.
He asked her if she liked it.
The victim was shaking. Before this Tribunal he
resiled from those facts. His evidence was that while he was attending to his
his step-daughter approached him and put her hand in his pocket on his
penis, kissed him on the cheek, and when he turned around
she kissed him on the
respect to count 2 when the victim was 12, in the agreed facts the respondent
said he undressed the victim, kissed her and touched
her inappropriately when
tucking her into bed His evidence to this Tribunal was different. He asserted
that when he would go in to
say goodnight and tuck the victim into bed, she
would pull on his tie to kiss him, causing him to fall on top of her and/or
her in inappropriate places in order to regain his balance.
is not open to the Tribunal to re-decide a matter that has been heard by a
criminal court. The Tribunal notes that the
High Court in
Ziems v The
Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of NSW
[1957] HCA 46
(1957) 97 CLR 279
at 286 declared
that where a final decision has been made in a criminal court of competent
policy required that a civil action could
not be used to initiate a collateral attack on that decision.
this Tribunal can consider the veracity of his evidence given with regard to his
previous convictions. This Tribunal finds
his evidence self serving and
unbelievable, particularly in light of the tender age of the victim. The
Tribunal has used these protestations,
claims of innocence and attempts to blame
the victim, when determining whether the respondent is fit to carry on practise
as an osteopath.
response to Murrell J.’s findings that Mr. Austin was fully rehabilitated,
the HCCC made a submission that it was evident
the Judge was not aware of the
finding of professional misconduct made by the Chiropractors Tribunal against
the respondent in March
2003 for failing to maintain professional boundaries
with a patient and entering into a personal and sexual relationship. The
submitted that this was irrelevant to the criminal matters for which
he had been convicted. The Tribunal finds it is relevant to
whether the
respondent is rehabilitated now, and observes that it is difficult to see how
Her Honour would have considered him rehabilitated
had she known about those
findings when preparing her sentencing report.
patient attending an osteopath places great trust on the integrity of the
practitioner. It is in the interest of the public to maintain
a high standard of
behaviour within the profession. The convictions were of a serious nature and in
the absence of evidence to show
he has been rehabilitated the Tribunal finds
that the respondent is not fit in the public interest to carry on practise as an
Complaint Two
the 15 May 2007 Mr Austin submitted an application for renewal of registration
to the NSW Osteopaths Registration Board. In this
document he declared there
were no criminal proceedings against him for a sex/violence offence alleged to
have been committed against
a minor’; when in fact he had been arrested
and charged on the 11 July 2006 in relation to a number of offences of indecent
assault against a female aged between 11 and 19 years old at the time of the
assaults (the assaults had all taken place between 1980
respondent gave several excuses for failing to disclose the criminal matter to
the board. In response to his suspension on 26
May 2008, the respondent wrote a
letter to the HCCC dated the 29 April 2009 stating that his legal advice at the
time was that he
was subject only to “serious allegations” thereby
inferring that he had no convictions. On the basis of this advice,
that the pending criminal proceedings against him didn’t require
disclosure in his renewal application. The respondent
cites an emailed letter
from his solicitor James Elliot, to support this claim. This Tribunal finds that
this email in no way offers
the advice of the nature that the respondent implied
in his letter
this same letter he admits that upon re-reading the question he has realised his
initial response was in error, but that this had
been an error of
‘misunderstanding’ and did not constitute an intentional misleading
of the Registration Board.
a letter to David McMahon of the Tribunal dated 27 May 2010 the respondent
again claimed that the advice he given by his solicitor
was that he ‘was
innocent until proven guilty. The Tribunal says that the respondent had been
registered as an Osteopath/Chiropractor
for many years and should have been
familiar with the process and completion of the form. The relevant question 5 on
the re-registration
form is clear and comprehensible. His explanation for the
erroneous completion of the registration form is inadequate, if not
disingenuous.
The Tribunal finds the respondent did contravene s20 of the
HCCC also claims the respondent has contravened s21 the
Osteopaths Act 2001
failing to notify the Osteopaths Registration Board
days of the commencement of the criminal proceedings or of his subsequent
conviction.
his letter to Ms Karen Mobbs of the HCCC, dated 29 April, 2009 the respondent
says he did telephone the Board on the 16 July 2006
direction’ regarding the proceedings. He says that in the absence of the
Assistant Registrar, the call was taken
by an ‘unnamed assistant’ to
whom he related the details of the allegations. He further writes that he
‘took direction’
from this unnamed assistant and ‘was given to
understand’, that no written advice was necessary.
if the Tribunal accepted the respondent’s evidence on this issue, it does
not accept that the respondent, who was an osteopath
of many years, had the
right to rely on such advice by an unnamed person. In any event the Act is
definitive; it states that an osteopath
“must notify the Board in
asked in cross examination about his failure to inform the board of his
conviction the respondent said “I don’t blame
it on my solicitors
... I merely took advice and I acted on it.” He then agreed that in doing
so he had failed in his professional
responsibility.
Tribunal finds that the respondent has contravened s20(1)(e) of the Act by
failing to inform the Board of the criminal proceedings
against him in his
application to re-register and has contravened s21 by failing to notify the
Board in writing of the impending
proceedings and then the conviction. In doing
so he has been guilty of unprofessional conduct within the meaning of s24 of the
the Act requires a registered osteopath to inform the board in writing within 7
days of the commencement of certain criminal
proceedings and of certain
convictions the Tribunal finds that failure to do so cannot be said to be
conduct in the course of the
practice or purported practice of osteopathy.
the Tribunal does find that the completion of an application for re-registration
is an aspect of the practice of a registered
osteopath because re-registration
is a requirement of professional practice. The process of re-registration is
less onerous than
that required of new registrants, and the integrity of the
re-registration process relies primarily on the veracity of the applicant.
his letter to the HCCC in August 2010, Mr Austin contradicted himself, initially
claiming that he misread the application form
and then stating that his
solicitor advised him that he ‘was innocent until proven guilty’
and so was not required to
declare the pending charges or conviction. Given the
absence of collaborating evidence and the clarity of the question on the
registration
form this Tribunal does not accept the evidence of the
respondent.
Tribunal finds that the respondent has deliberately and knowingly made a false
declaration on his registration form and in doing
so has acted unethically and
improperly in the course of his professional practice of osteopathy. In so doing
he has been guilty
of unprofessional conduct within the meaning of s24 of the
Complaint Three.
particulars of this complaint are identical to those of Complaint Two where a
finding of unsatisfactory professional conduct is
made out. The Tribunal must
now determine whether that conduct was sufficiently serious to warrant either
suspension or cancellation
of the respondent’s practicing certificate.
practise as an osteopath carries a heavy burden of honesty and trust. This is
crucial for both the patients and for the profession
as a whole. Given the facts
and circumstances of the allegations, the respondent’s failure to disclose
those pending criminal
proceedings on his registration and his failure to inform
the board in writing of his conviction within 7 days or at all, are sufficiently
serious to warrant cancellation of the respondent’s practicing
certificate. This Tribunal finds the claim of professional misconduct
In this particular set of circumstances the Tribunal finds that the Respondent
knew of the statutory requirement to inform the Registration
Board in writing
within 7 days of the commencement of certain proceedings and of convictions.
However the Tribunal notes that the
HCCC did not tender any evidence that
practitioners were informed there was a statutory requirement.
Complaint Four
claim incorporates all the particulars in Claims 1, 2 & 3 and in addition
particularises the findings of professional misconduct
as a chiropractor on the
26 February 2003 for failing to maintain appropriate boundaries and entering
into a personal and sexual
relationship with a patient.
his letter to the Tribunal the respondent attached several judgments including
Sherman v Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria (Occupational and Business)
[2005] VCAT 644
and marked:
The fact the respondent
gave false evidence is a grave reflection upon his character’
The respondent left a passage and then also marked:
The evaluation of good character should not be done by reference to
irrelevant or idiosyncratic notions of what ‘good character’
in other contexts. The notion is not at large - it needs to be conducted by
reference to matters relevant to criteria for
professional practice and the
objects of the Act. It is not every flaw of character....which will justify a
conclusion that a person
seeking registration...is not of good
character....something more grave and serious and of relevance to capacity to
practise...must
Tribunal finds that giving false evidence is a character flaw that reflects
directly on whether the respondent is of good character
for the purpose of
carrying on his profession as an osteopath.
J in Ex parte Tziniolis (1966) 84 WN(NSW) (part 2) 275@ 277:-
When deciding the question of whether a person is of good
character....I am of the opinion that....the court is required to consider
matters affecting the moral standards, attitudes and qualities of the applicant
and not merely to consider what is his general reputation.
I think further, that we are entitled to inquire into what may be
described as personal misconduct, as distinct from professional
...there maybe some kinds of conduct deserving of disapproval which have little
or no bearing on the question whether
or not it is shown that an applicant for
registration as a medical practitioner is a person of good character
then @ 461:
Once it has been established that a practitioner is not of good
character, the mere passage of time is insufficient to establish an
improvement.
Evidence is required to show that his character has changed. In effect the onus
shifts to the practitioner to show a
reformation of character.’
hold a position of trust and therefore integrity must be an integral element of
good character required by a practitioner.
The Tribunal found the respondent
lacked credibility when giving evidence. There was no evidence before the
Tribunal, since the visits
to psychiatrists in 2000, that shows a reformation of
character. The Tribunal finds the respondent has failed to satisfy any
onus which in our opinion falls on him since the findings
in 2003 and finds the respondent is not of good character.
