REASONS FOR DECISION:
Introduction
For reasons delivered on 8 January 2003 I
ordered the respondent homeowner to pay the applicant builder $3,033.40 within
the date of the order. The applicant builder was ordered to carry
out rectification work at a time to be agreed between the parties,
but no later
than 28 February 2003. Consequential orders were made about establishing the
quality and effectiveness of the rectification.
The parties were given the opportunity to
make written submissions about costs of the proceedings. These reasons deal
with the costs.
Applicant’s
submissions
On 22 January 2003 the submissions made on
behalf of the applicant were received in the registry. An order was sought that
the respondent
pay the applicant’s costs of the proceedings, both in the
tribunal and in the Magistrates Court.
There was some suggestion that but for the
respondent’s conduct in litigating the matter which proceeded to a 3 day
the applicant would not have proceeded with his claim. Submissions were
made about what might have happened had the applicant not
pressed for payment,
however in my view those submissions are irrelevant, given that the applicant
proceeded with his claim.
It was submitted that the applicant had
been forced to litigate the matter due to the alleged counterclaim of the
respondent, as well
as the issue of subsidence. It was observed that the
subsidence issue was severed in a directions hearing in August 2002, only a
months before the hearing of these proceedings. The issue of subsidence is yet
to be resolved, but is in the hands of the Queensland
Building Services
Authority (“the authority”).
It was submitted that as early as 1
September 2000 the applicant had agreed to repair many of the items about which
the respondent
complained. It was submitted that the respondent disingenuously
rejected the proposal to rectify. It was submitted that ultimately
applicant was only ordered to rectify 5 items not already agreed to require
rectification. Of those 5, it was submitted that
4 were of a minor nature and
the remaining item was only brought to the attention of the applicant shortly
before the hearing.
It was submitted that shortly after the
hearing of this matter commenced, the applicant put forward an open offer in an
settle the matter which was not accepted. A copy of the offer was
attached to the submissions. Essentially the offer was that the
builder would
abandon his claim and attend to certain items from the authority’s report
if the homeowner withdrew her counterclaim.
Each party’s rights in
respect of the subsidence claim were to be preserved.
Respondent’s submissions
On 28 January 2003 the solicitors for the
respondent filed written submissions. It was submitted that the respondent
should have
her costs of the proceedings as she had been substantially
successful in her claim, whereas the applicant had, in monetary terms,
of his claim than he had succeeded in.
In respect of the applicant’s claim
it was submitted that the builder’s failure to comply with Section 59 of
Queensland Building Services Authority Act
1991 (“the QBSA
Act”) coupled with his failure to obtain written approval for extra work
lead to the matter becoming
a dispute to be heard by the
By way of contrast it was submitted that
the respondent had been substantially successful, although the order fashioned
by the tribunal
was not identical to the relief sought by her (her claim had
been for money rather than rectification).
An attempt was made to explain away the
respondent’s response to the applicant’s offer to rectify in
September 2000 on
the basis that she had received advice from the tribunal as to
how to respond. It was submitted that her response could not have
construed as a refusal to allow the applicant time to undertake rectification
but rather that her response was a request for
a detailed proposal in relation
to rectification before the proposal was considered.
It was further submitted that the
September 2000 response must be understood in context, in particular given that
the issue of subsidence
was then live. It is submitted that while the
subsidence related defects were not directly relevant to the hearing, they were
in terms of consideration of the reasonableness of the position taken
by the respondent during the period that the subsidence was
part of the tribunal
proceedings.
It was submitted that the offer to settle
made on 6 November 2002 should be disregarded as the respondent had only thirty
to consider it, it being expressed to expire at 10:00AM on 6
These proceedings are conducted pursuant
to the QBSA Act. Section 95(4)(g) of that Act gives no guidance as to the
exercise of the
discretion of the tribunal in respect of the awarding of
It is well known that the object of a
costs order is not to penalise but to indemnify the successful party in regard
to the expense
to which it has been put by reason of legal
proceedings.
I have had no regard to the offer made on
the first morning of the hearing. Contrary to the submissions the offer was not
offer, but was made on a “without prejudice” basis, save as
to costs. It was not open for a sufficient time for the
applicant to give it
proper consideration.
In these proceedings each party enjoyed a
measure of success. The applicant recovered approximately half of the amount he
The respondent did not recover any money, but received the benefit of
an order that rectification be undertaken in respect of some,
but by no means
all, of the defects about which she complained. Her claims for liquidated
damages and various credits were unsuccessful,
save for one instance where a
credit was conceded.
No plausible reason was given as to why
the respondent refused the offer of rectification. Even if she did not
understand it at the
time it was made she had more than two years to take advice
On the basis that costs might follow the
event, which is the appropriate starting point under the QBSA Act, a possible
order would
be that the respondent pay the applicant’s costs of the claim
and that the applicant pay the respondent’s costs of the
counter-claim, in
each case assessed by reference to the Magistrates Court Scale of costs. In my
view there would be no utility
in making such an order as effectively the costs
awards would cancel each other out.
In the circumstances, I am of the view
that each party should bear their own costs.
No order will be made in respects of
costs in the Magistrates Court as this tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with
