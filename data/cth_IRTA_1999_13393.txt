affirms the decision under review to refuse the grant of
a Family (Residence)
(Class AO) visa to the Applicant.
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
On 13 November 1998 an application was made to this Tribunal for a review of a
decision made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration
and Multicultural
Affairs (the Minister) at the Department of Immigration and Multicultural
Affairs (the Department) on 12 March
1998, to refuse Mr Beng Hian Cheok (also
known as Daniel Lee) a Family (Residence) (Class AO) visa to enable him to
remain in Australia
with his daughter Pamela Wen Kuan Cheok. This decision was
affirmed by the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) on 23 October
Mr Ben Hian Cheok (also known as Daniel Lee) (the Applicant) was born in
Singapore on 25 May 1958 and is a citizen of that country.
He is not married.
His mother and siblings reside overseas in Singapore. His daughter Pamela Wen
Kuan Cheok was born on 12 February
1992 from a relationship with a student from
Hong Kong, is in Australia with him.
The Applicant came to Australia as a visitor on 19 September 1985. He was
granted permission on arrival to remain here until 16
October 1985. At the
expiration of that permission to remain in Australia, the Applicant remained
here illegally. He was located
by compliance on 29 November 1995 as a person
unlawfully in Australia.
After the birth of his daughter in 1992, the mother, a student in Australia on
a temporary visa returned to Hong Kong leaving the
Applicant to care for his
On 5 March 1996 the Applicant lodged a completed application Form 887, seeking
to remain in Australia. He had applied for a Family
Residence visa (Class AO)
and had ticked the "
" subclass box on the application Form 887.
He was not nominated for residence by any Australian citizen or permanent
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
On 4 March 1998 the Applicant's application to remain in Australia was refused
on the basis that he was unable to meet the legislative
requirements for the
Family (Residence) (Class AO) Subclass 806 visa. The decision maker noted that
the Applicant was also unable
to satisfy any of the subclasses of visa referred
to in clause 1115 of the Migration Regulations. The Applicant was notified of
the decision on 4 March 1998, by hand.
MIRO affirmed the decision not to grant him a Class AO visa on
23 October 1998. The MIRO review officer found that the Applicant
did not satisfy the requirements for the visa sought.
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
The subclasses for a Family (Residence) (Class AO) visa are contained in clause
1115 of the Migration Regulations (the Regulations).
The subclasses referred
to in that clause are as follows:
831 (Prospective Marriage Spouse)
802 (Child)
804 (Aged Parent)
806 (Family)
832 (Close Ties)
The requirements for those Subclasses of visa are set out in Schedule 2 of the
Regulations.
EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS
The Department's file relating to this application has been made available to
the Tribunal.
By letter dated 13 January 1999 the Applicant's adviser indicated that the
Applicant did not want to attend a hearing. The Tribunal
is therefore to make
its decision on the evidence and material before it.
From the evidence and material before it the Tribunal finds, on balance, that
the Applicant is unable to satisfy any of the subclasses
of visas referred to
in paragraph 1115 of Schedule 1 of the Regulations. Indeed no submissions were
received by the Applicant or
on his behalf that he was able to satisfy the
criteria for the visa applied for.
The Applicant has not been nominated for residence in Australia by any
Australian citizen or permanent resident. As well, he has
been in Australia
illegally since his entry permit (visa) expired in 1985. He is unable to
satisfy clauses 3001 or 3002 contained
in Schedule 3 of the Regulations.
The Tribunal notes that in the application Form 887 the Applicant indicated he
was required as a
"special need relative"
for his daughter Pamela who
was born in Australia in 1996. However Pamela is not an Australian citizen
(see Citizenship Act 1947)
nor is she an Australian permanent resident. It
appears she is not the holder of a visa permitting her to remain in
The need to satisfy the Schedule 3 criteria is a requirement in some of the
Subclasses of visa applied for (see eg clause 806.212).
From the evidence and material before it, the Tribunal finds on balance, that
the Applicant is not a
"aged parent", "prospective
spouse", "an orphan relative", "remaining relative",
"special need
as defined in the Regulations, nor was it submitted he was. He
also does not satisfy the criteria for a Subclass 832 Visa.
The Tribunal understands that the Applicant, because of his circumstances,
wishes to make an approach to the Minister pursuant to
section 351 of the Act.
Such an approach is of course a matter for the Applicant and his advisers.
The Tribunal pursuant to section 349(2)(a) of the Migration Act affirms the
decision under review to refuse the grant of a Family
(Residence) (Class AO)
visa to the Applicant.
