Megson v The Queen
[2006] NTSC 15
No. 20515013

CORAM: ANGEL, MILDREN & RILEY JJ
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 28 February 2006)
[1] This is a
reference to the Full Court pursuant to s 21(1) of the Supreme Court
[2] The accused
was committed for trial upon an information that he did at night time unlawfully
enter an occupied dwelling with intent
to commit a crime therein, namely
assault, contrary to s 213 of the Criminal Code, and was further committed
on a count of stealing.
Subsequently, the indictment presented contained only
one count in the following terms:
“On or about 23 June
2005 at Palmerston in the Northern Territory of Australia, unlawfully entered a
building, namely 26 Phineaus
Court, with intent to commit an offence therein,
namely assault
AND THAT the unlawful entry involved the following circumstances of
aggravation, namely,
(i) that the building was a dwelling house, and
(ii) that the unlawful entry occurred at night-time.
Section 213(1), (2) & (5) of the Criminal Code.”
[3] The maximum
penalty for an offence against s 213(1) with the circumstances of
aggravation alleged is imprisonment for four years.
[4] The matter
came before Angel J on 9 February 2006. Pursuant to s 339(1)(a)
of the Criminal Code the accused sought to quash the
indictment as being
defective on the grounds that the offence charged is a simple offence and that
there is no power to charge a
simple offence on indictment.
[5] Reliance was
placed upon an unreported decision of Bailey J in
7 September 2001. The Crown submitted that the offence charged was a crime
by virtue of s 38E of the Interpretation Act due to
the fact that
applicable maximum penalty exceeds two years. The Crown further submitted that
the decision of Bailey J to the contrary
should not be followed.
[6] Angel J
referred the matter to the Full Court pursuant to s 21 of the Supreme Court
Act. After hearing submissions, the Court
made an order dismissing the
defendant’s application. We indicated that we would provide our reasons at
a later time. These
are those reasons.
[7] Section 213
provides as follows:
“213. Unlawful entry of buildings
(1) Any person who
unlawfully enters a building with intent to commit any offence therein is guilty
of an offence.
(2) If he does so with intent to commit a simple offence therein he is guilty
of a simple offence and is liable to imprisonment for
one year; if the building
is a dwelling-house he is liable to imprisonment for 2 years.
(3) If he does so with intent to commit therein a crime for which the maximum
punishment is not greater than 3 years imprisonment,
he is guilty of a crime and
is liable to imprisonment for 3 years; if the building is a dwelling-house he is
liable to imprisonment
for 5 years and, if it is actually occupied at the time
of his entry, he is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.
(4) If he does so with intent to commit any other crime therein he is guilty
of a crime and is liable to imprisonment for 7 years;
if the building is a
dwelling-house he is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.
(5) If he commits an offence hereinbefore defined at night-time he is liable
to twice the punishment prescribed for that offence.
(6) If he commits an offence defined by this section when armed with a
firearm or any other dangerous or offensive weapon, he is liable
to imprisonment
for 20 years; if the building is a dwelling-house he is liable to imprisonment
[8] Section 3 of
the Criminal Code divides offences into three kinds namely crimes, simple
offences and regulatory offences. Section
3 provides as
“3. Division of offences
(1) Offences are of 3 kinds,
namely, crimes, simple offences and regulatory offences.
(2) A person charged with a crime cannot, unless otherwise stated, be
prosecuted or found guilty except upon indictment.
(3) Unless otherwise stated, a person guilty of a simple offence or a
regulatory offence may be found guilty summarily.
(4) An offence not otherwise designated is a simple offence.”
[9] Counsel for
the accused submitted that the offence charged in the indictment is a simple
offence and that there is no power to
charge a simple offence upon indictment.
Mr Coates, the Director of Public Prosecutions, submitted that the offence was a
It was not contended that offences other than crimes were indictable
offences: see
Birkeland-Corro v Tudor-Stack
[2005] NTSC 23
(2005) 15 NTLR 208
per B.R. Martin CJ.
argument of the accused commences with the proposition that s 213(1) of the
Criminal Code creates the offence which is a
simple offence. Section 213
subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) are circumstances of aggravation and do not
create separate offences.
For those propositions reliance is placed upon the
decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
R v Kurungaiyi
[2005] NTCCA 12
(2005) 15 NTLR
It was submitted that the wording of s 213(2) of the Code confirmed
that the count is to remain a simple offence because the provision
specifically
so provides. Further it was submitted that the wording of s 213(5) coupled
with s 213(2) confirmed that the offence
was to remain a simple offence
because all it did was increase the punishment. It was put that the draughtsman
in contrast with the
course adopted by s 188(2) of the Criminal Code did
not seek to provide that in circumstances where s 213(1), s 213(2) and
were relied upon the accused had committed a crime.
[11] However, as
Mr Coates points out in his submission, s 213 creates some basic offences
with various circumstances of aggravation
which results in a very large number
of possible combinations. In fact there are 20 possible combinations of the
basic offence and
aggravation provisions. If, for example, the defendant had
unlawfully entered a dwelling at night with intent to commit assault and
so when armed with a firearm or any other dangerous or offensive weapon he was
liable to life imprisonment. As Mr Coates pointed
out, if the accused’s
argument were correct and an offence carrying a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment was merely a simple
offence which could only be dealt with
summarily before a magistrate, the accused would be deprived of his right to
trial by jury.
Such a result would also be inconsistent with s 121A and
s 122A of the Justices Act in that it is not envisaged that a person
with an indictable offence against s 213 for which a maximum
penalty of life imprisonment is imposed can be dealt with summarily
power of the Court of Summary Jurisdiction constituted by a magistrate to
conduct a preliminary examination in relation to
the offence under s 122A
depends upon the Court dealing with an offence which is an indictable
[12] Counsel for
the accused relied upon the unreported judgment of Bailey J in
In that case, the defendant had been charged with two counts of unlawful
stalking, contrary to s 189 of the Criminal Code. Count
1 in the indictment
was subject to a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, but count 2 was
subject to a maximum penalty of five
years imprisonment pursuant to
s 189(2)(b). It was submitted before Bailey J that neither offence was
an indictable offence and that
the two charges should have proceeded in the
Court of Summary Jurisdiction on complaint.
[13] Bailey J
considered the effect of s 38E of the Interpretation Act which provides as
38E. Certain offences crimes
Where an Act provides for a penalty of imprisonment for a period of more than
2 years for an offence by an individual against a provision
of or under the Act,
the offence is a crime (whether committed by or imputed to a body corporate or
committed by an individual) unless
expressed to be otherwise.
[14] Bailey J
“However, section 38E is subject by its terms to apply,
‘unless expressed to be otherwise’. In this context I consider
section 3 of the Criminal Code expressly displaces the prima facie provision of
section 38E of the Interpretation Act by expressly
providing for a division of
offences on a basis other than the maximum available penalty. It follows, in my
view, that there is nothing
in section 38E to detract from applying section 3 of
the Criminal Code to section 189 of the Code.
Accordingly both charges of stalking against the applicant are simple
offences, notwithstanding the difference between them in terms
[15] Mr Coates
referred the Court to the history of s 38E. That section was inserted into
the Interpretation Act by the Interpretation
(Criminal Code) Amendment Act which
was one of a number of Acts which were introduced to give effect to the passage
of the Criminal
Code Act in 1984. Thus it was submitted that s 38E was
intended to be read with s 3(4) of the Criminal Code. Mr Coates submitted
that there was no inconsistency between the two provisions.
[16] We consider
that the argument of Mr Coates is correct and that the decision of Bailey J
is incorrect and should be overruled.
In our opinion, the two provisions were
intended to be read together and can be so read. Section 3(4) of the Criminal
Code is not
confined in the manner submitted by Mr Tippett QC. In our
opinion, an offence which carries a maximum penalty in excess of two years
imprisonment has been designated by s 38E of the Interpretation Act to be a
crime and therefore is not an offence “not otherwise
designated”
within the meaning of s 3(4) of the Criminal Code. It is to be borne in
mind that s 3 of the Code applies to all
Statutes which create offences and
is not confined to the offence provisions of the Code. Reading s 3(4) with
s 38E of the Interpretation
Act does not result in s 3(4) being
redundant because the result is that an offence of two years or less is a simple
offence and
not, for example, a regulatory offence unless the relevant statute
otherwise provides.
[17] Further
there is nothing in the decision of in
R v Kurungaiyi
which compels a
different result.
[18] Section
213(1) merely states the offence and the circumstances of aggravation indicate
the level of penalty. Whilst there is
some attraction in the argument of
Mr Tippett QC in that s 213(2) provides that if one unlawfully
enters a building with intent to
commit a simple offence one is guilty of a
simple offence, whereas if one does so with intent to commit a crime one is
a crime, we do not think that this can compel the result when it is
plainly open on the defendant’s construction for there
to be a simple
offence carrying sentences of four years, 20 years or life depending upon the
circumstances of aggravation alleged.
Birkeland-Corro v Tudor-Stack
, supra, B.R. Martin CJ considered
whether s 131A of the Justices Act was capable of conferring summary
serious offences which attracted significant
sentences of imprisonment. His Honour said, at para 101 that he was not prepared
infer that the legislature intended to deprive a defendant of a right to
trial by jury in respect of the serious offences identified
in s 131A in
the absence of plain wording to that effect.
[20] Similarly
we do not think that an accused facing serious charges against s 213 of the
Criminal Code carrying the kind of penalties
to which we have referred should be
deprived of the right to trial by jury unless there are specific words in the
provisions compelling
