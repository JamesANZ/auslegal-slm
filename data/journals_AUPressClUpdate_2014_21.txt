APC UPDATE | 25 November 2014
Summary of latest adjudications
Judith Troeth/The Age
The Press Council has considered a complaint about two articles in The Age
concerning Austin Hospital’s waiting times and booking
The Council concluded that the first article implied a particular knee
replacement did not occur until more than three years after
it was needed. In
fact, it occurred only about eight months after the specialist recommended it.
The operation could have been earlier
if the patient had not wanted to wait for
a particular surgeon.
Accordingly, the complaint about this article was upheld on the ground of
failure to take reasonable steps to ensure accuracy and
fairness. The related
complaint that the error should have been promptly corrected was not upheld
because the hospital had not promptly
provided adequate evidence of the error
and had refused an offer of a follow-up article.
The Council concluded that the headline of the second article stated as a
fact that a miscommunication between the hospital and a
patient had been due to
a new booking system. But the publication had not taken reasonable steps to
ensure that statement was accurate
and fair, and the headline did not fairly
reflect the text of the article in which the hospital’s differing version
was mentioned
at some length. Accordingly, the complaint about the headline was
upheld on those grounds.

John McLean/Climate Spectator
The Press Council has considered a complaint about an article by Elaine
McKewon headed “Fairfax falls for the climate conman”
Spectator website on 14 January 2014. The heading was subsequently changed to
“Fairfax misleads on self-titled climate
The article described John McLean, the author of an article published in
Fairfax newspapers, as being “misinformed”, “falsely
as an expert on climate science”, “not affiliated with any
university”, and having “no verifiable
qualifications in the field
of climate science” or “standing or expertise in climate
science”. It also said he
was a member of the ICSC, which was a body aimed
at “discrediting authoritative science on climate change” and had
links to the oil company Exxon.
Mr McLean said the claims about his lack of standing and expertise were
inaccurate and unfair. He denied deceiving the newspapers
and said that, in any event, they were under no obligation to publish only the
opinions of climate science experts.
He especially criticised the word
“conman” in the article’s headline. He also complained that
the statements about
his links with the ICSC and its funding were inaccurate and
The Council considered that the word “conman” in the headline
could reasonably be read as implying that Mr McLean had
actively deceived the
newspapers and readers. As no reasonable basis for that implication had been
provided to the Council, this
aspect of the complaint was upheld. The
publication’s subsequent change to the headline was welcome but did not
eliminate the
initial breach. In any event, the initial headline was likely to
have been read by many people and be permanently available on the
through re-publication by others.
Mr McLean’s claims to standing and expertise, however, were not of
sufficiently compelling force to establish misrepresentation
or suppression by
Ms McKewon in that respect. The same applied to his criticisms of her references
to the ICSC and its funding. Accordingly,
these aspects of the complaint were
not upheld. But it was emphasised that this conclusion did not amount to a
finding that her claims
were necessarily correct. It also did not involve an
endorsement or rejection of any particular theories or predictions about climate
change warming and related issues.

John McLean/Crikey
The Press Council has considered a complaint about an article by Elaine
McKewon headed “Big Oil-backed climate denier who hoodwinked
Fairfax” on the Crikey website on 13 January 2014.
The article described John McLean, the author of an article published in
Fairfax newspapers, as being “misinformed”, “falsely
as an expert on climate science”, “not affiliated with any
university”, and having “no verifiable
qualifications in the field
of climate science” or “standing or expertise in climate
science”. It also said he
was a member of the ICSC which was a body aimed
at “discrediting authoritative science on climate change” and had
links to the oil company Exxon.
Mr McLean said the claims about his lack of standing and expertise were
inaccurate and unfair. He denied deceiving the newspapers
and said that, in any event, they were under no obligation to publish only the
opinions of climate science experts.
He especially criticised the word
“hoodwinked” in the article’s headline. He also complained
that the statements
inaccurate and unfair.
The Council considered that the word “hoodwinked” in the headline
could reasonably be read as implying that Mr McLean
had actively deceived the
newspapers and readers. As no reasonable basis for that implication had been
provided to the Council, this
aspect of the complaint was upheld.
Mr McLean’s claims to standing and expertise, however, were not of
sufficiently compelling force to establish misrepresentation
or suppression by
Ms McKewon in that respect. The same applied to his criticisms of her references
