State Revenue Office accepting personal cheques.
The State Revenue Office will generally accept
personal cheques for the payment of debts or
liabilities. This includes payments made by cheques
drawn on business accounts.
However, the Commissioner of State Revenue has
the discretion to refuse payment by personal
cheques. For example the Commissioner of State
Revenue may refuse to accept personal cheques
from taxpayers where they have previously had
personal cheques dishonoured when making
payment to the State Revenue Office.

Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is

regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
