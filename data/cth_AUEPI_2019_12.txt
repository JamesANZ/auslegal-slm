Fuel Quality Standards (Ethanol E85) Determination 2019 [2019] AUEPI 12 (25 September 2019)
Fuel Quality Standards (Ethanol E85) Determination 2019
I, Angus Taylor, Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, make the
following determination.
Dated 18 September 2019
Angus Taylor
Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction
This instrument is the
Fuel Quality Standards
(Ethanol E85) Determination 2019
2 Commencement
This instrument commences on 1 October 2019.
3 Authority
This instrument is made under
Fuel Quality Standards
4 Definitions
Note: A number of expressions used in this instrument are defined in
of the Act, including the following:
In this instrument:
Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000
followed by an alphanumeric code means the testing method
developed under that code by the standards development organisation called
International.
followed by a numeric code means the testing method
developed under that code by the European Committee for Standardization.
means dry vapour pressure equivalent.
mixture of petrol and ethanol that is
supplied or represented as E85 fuel.
requires the fuel to be 70–85% v/v ethanol.
followed by a numeric code means the testing method
developed under that code by the European Committee for Standardization.
means milligrams per kilogram, and is equivalent to
‘parts per million’ or ‘ppm’ by mass.
has the same meaning as in the
Fuel Quality Standards
(Petrol) Determination 2019.
means per cent volume by volume, and is equivalent to
‘volume %’, ‘vol %’ and ‘% vol’.
means per cent mass by mass, and is equivalent to
‘mass %’, ‘% mass’ and ‘weight %’.
5 Fuel standard for
(1) In relation to a parameter mentioned in an item of the following table,
E85 must comply with the specification for that parameter
mentioned in that
Specification
Testing Method
Acidity—as acetic acid
0.006% m/m maximum
0.35% v/v maximum
0.10 mg/kg maximum
EN 15837 (as modified in CEN/TS 15293)
Distillation—final boiling point
210°C maximum
Ethers—5 or more C atoms
1.0% v/v maximum
Inorganic chloride
10 mg/kg maximum
5 mg/L maximum
0.5% v/v maximum
Motor octane number (MON)
Oxidation stability
360 minutes minimum
1.3 mg/L maximum
Research octane number (RON)
100 minimum
Solvent washed gum
5.0 mg/100 mL maximum
4.0 mg/kg maximum
From commencement
52 mg/kg maximum
From 1 July 2027
10 mg/kg maximum
Vapour pressure (DVPE) at 37.8°C
1.0% m/m maximum
Note : Testing methods for determining the MON and RON of E85 are not yet
available. The minimum targets specified in the table are
interim targets until
a testing method is available. These minimum targets allow for engine
calibration.
(2) For subsection (1), compliance with the specification for a parameter is
determined by using the testing method for that parameter
mentioned in that item
of the table.
Note: The testing methods listed in the table are the methods that will be
used by inspectors and other persons authorised to conduct
tests on fuel under
the Act to determine whether the fuel complies with the relevant fuel standard.
Subsection (2) does not prevent
other persons (including persons supplying fuel)
from using other test methods to ensure that the fuel complies with the relevant
fuel standard.
(3) Any petrol component of E85 must meet the requirements of the fuel
quality standard for petrol set out in the
Fuel Quality Standards (Petrol)
Determination 2019.
(4) Any ethanol component of E85 must meet the requirements of the fuel
quality standard for ethanol set out in the
Fuel Quality Standards (Petrol)
Determination 2019.
