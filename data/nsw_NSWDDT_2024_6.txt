Introduction
plaintiff seeks leave pursuant to
Civil Liability (Third Party Claims
Against Insurers) Act 2017
(the 2017 Act) to continue the proceedings
against the sixth defendant, the Workers Compensation Nominal Insurer (WCNI), in
of the liability of an uninsured employer of the plaintiff, Rabi Harmes.
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury against six defendants alleging that
he has contracted silicosis and a psychological
injury arising from his exposure
to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) in the course of his employment with
three employers:
(a) Rabi Harmes, in the period of about late 2009 to late 2011/2012;
(b) Italian Marble and Granite Pty Ltd (Italian Marble) from about late
2011/2012 to about May 2014; and
(c) Granitestone Pty Ltd (Granitestone) from about April 2017 to about July
is common ground that Italian Marble and Granitestone were insured under the
Workers Compensation Act 1987
(the 1987 Act) but that the insurers are no
longer in existence and that leave should be granted to continue the proceedings
the WCNI relating to those employers.
the purposes of the Notice of Motion, the WCNI accepts that Mr Harmes was
uninsured for the period of the plaintiff’s employment,
and that the
plaintiff was employed by Mr Harmes.
plaintiff contends that he is able to make a claim on the WCNI because his
employer, Mr Harmes, was uninsured: s 140 of the 1987
Act. He contends that the
meaning of “uninsured” in s 140 is contextually informed by the
requirement in s 155(1) and
s 155(1A) of the 1987 Act that an employer’s
policy of insurance was required to provide cover for an injury including a
disease” as defined by the
Workers’ Compensation
(Dust Diseases) Act 1942
(the 1942 Act). He also relies on a body of
extrinsic material to contend that when parliament introduced the Uninsured
Scheme (ULS) it was intended to provide cover for all workers, who
through no fault on their part, were employed by a person without
WCNI submits that a grant of leave to continue the proceedings against it would
be futile, because on proper construction, a claim
relating to a dust disease is
excluded from the workers compensation legislation.
the reasons that follow, it is inappropriate at this time to finally decide the
statutory interpretation point because it is:
(a) clearly arguable and thereby not futile; and
(b) not presently amenable to authoritative determination by way of separate
question, appeal or a stated case.
those circumstances, the plaintiff should have leave to continue the proceedings
against the WCNI in respect of the plaintiff’s
employment with Mr Harmes.
The WCNI is at liberty to bring the question for separate determination, or to
reassess its position at
the conclusion of the proceedings.
Relevant Law
The 2017 Act
3 of the 2017 Act defines the term “insured liability” to mean,
“a liability in respect of which an insured
person is entitled to be
indemnified by an insurer”.
4 of the 2017 Act provides:
4 Claimant may recover from insurer in certain
circumstances
(1) If an insured person has an insured liability to a
person (the
), the claimant may, subject to this Act,
recover the amount of the insured liability from the insurer in proceedings
before a court.
(2) The amount of the insured liability is the amount of
indemnity (if any) payable pursuant to the terms of the contract of
insurance in
respect of the insured person’s liability to the claimant.
(3) In proceedings brought by a claimant against an
insurer under this section, the insurer stands in the place of the insured
person as if the proceedings were proceedings to recover damages, compensation
or costs from the insured person. Accordingly (but
subject to this Act), the
parties have the same rights and liabilities, and the court has the same powers,
as if the proceedings
were proceedings brought against the insured person.
(4) This section does not entitle a claimant to recover
any amount from a re-insurer under a contract or arrangement for
re-insurance.
5 of the 2017 Act provides:
5 Leave to proceed
(1) Proceedings may not be brought, or continued,
against an insurer under section 4 except by leave of the court in which the
proceedings are to be, or have been, commenced.
(2) An application for leave may be made before or after
proceedings under section 4 have been commenced.
(3) Subject to subsection (4), the court may grant or
refuse the claimant’s application for leave.
(4) Leave must be refused if the insurer can establish
that it is entitled to disclaim liability under the contract of insurance
under any Act or law.
threshold for a grant of leave under the 2017 Act is low. In
Murphy McCarthy
and Associates Pty Ltd v Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd
[2018] NSWSC 627
Hammerschlag J observed at [16]-[17]:
The requirement for leave under s 5(4) of the Act is one imposed to insulate
insurers from exposure to untenable claims. The discretion
to give leave to
bring such a claim is to be exercised with this in mind.
[The plaintiff] must have an arguable case against [the insured], there must be
an arguable case that the policy responds to it and
there must be a real
possibility that if the judgment is obtained [the insured] would not be able to
Consideration
WCNI is presently an active party to the proceedings, representing the interests
of Italian Marble and Granitestone. Its interests
include establishing the
nature and extent of the plaintiff’s exposure to RCS in his various
periods of employment and seeking
contribution and/or indemnity from the
suppliers of the material that the plaintiff worked with. If the WCNI was also
required to
represent the interests of Mr Harmes, that would add very little to
its existing role in the litigation and it is highly unlikely
that it would add
substantially to its costs.
grant of leave or refusal of leave under s 5 of the 2017 Act, would be an
interlocutory decision that would require the losing party
to seek leave to
appeal. It is arguable as to whether or not a final decision on the statutory
interpretation point would arise in
such an interlocutory appeal. The Court of
Appeal may take the view that the statutory interpretation point does not arise
for determination,
because a grant of leave under s 5 of the 2017 Act requires
only that the plaintiff demonstrate an arguable case.
plaintiff’s contentions as to the contextual interpretation of ss 140 and
155 as “mirror” provisions and the
purposive interpretation based on
the extrinsic materials are powerful. On the other hand, WCNI contends that the
purposive interpretation
has to overcome the language of the workers
compensation legislation and in particular grapple with the definition of
in s 4 of the 1987 Act (which excludes a “dust
disease” as defined by the 1942 Act) and the meaning of “work injury
damages” contained in s 250
Workplace Injury Management and Workers
Compensation Act 1998
(the 1998 Act).
am satisfied that the plaintiff has an arguable case. I am not satisfied that
the WCNI has established it to be futile to the requisite
is convenient and efficient to allow the proceedings to continue against the
WCNI. The WCNI, if so advised, can bring the statutory
interpretation point on
as a separate question or a stated case at an appropriate time. In the
alternative, it could wait to argue
the statutory interpretation point at the
conclusion of the case, when all of the necessary findings of fact have been
course I have taken means that it is unnecessary to finally determine the
statutory interpretation point at this time. Accordingly,
no party has been
particularly successful, but may be in the future. In those circumstances the
appropriate costs order is that costs
be in the cause on this issue.
orders I make are as follows:
(1) I grant leave to the plaintiff to continue the proceedings against the sixth
defendant pursuant to s 5
Civil Liability (Third Party Claims Against
Insurers) Act 2017
(2) I grant leave to the plaintiff to file the Amended Statement of Claim
annexed and marked “A” to the Notice of Motion.
(3) Costs of the motion are costs in the cause.
