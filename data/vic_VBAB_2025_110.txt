Subject Land:
a) carry out alterations and additions to the existing house on the Subject Land
Alterations
b) have a pre-fabricated shed constructed on the Subject Land (

is not in doubt, there is a question as
to whether he was also appointed, in
July 2024, as the RBS in respect of the Shed.

as the RBS in respect of
is this question as to whether Mr Herbig was also appointed as the RBS for the
Shed that has led to the current proceeding. The
relevant chronology is set out
below, however Mr Herbig considered that he was the RBS for the Shed as well as
the Alterations and
therefore was surprised to find that the Shed had been
constructed when he came to carry out the final inspection of the Alterations.
As a result of finding that the Shed had been constructed, he served a building
notice dated 18 February 2025 under s 106 of the
on the Applicants,
alleging that the Shed had been constructed in circumstances where he, as the
RBS for that building work, had
not received an application for a building
permit for that work.
Applicants submit that Mr Herbig was never appointed as the RBS for the Shed,
and that Mr Kunze had been appointed to that role
on 11 September 2024.
Further, they submit that Mr Kunze had issued a building permit for the Shed,
and that it had been constructed
in accordance with that permit. Consequently,
they submit that Mr Herbig does not have the power to serve the Building Notice,
as a result that the Building Notice should be cancelled.
Applicants appealed to the Building Appeals Board (
) pursuant to
Building Act 1993
) against Mr Herbig’s
decision to serve the Building Notice. The appeal was referred to us to
whether the Respondent was retained as a relevant
building surveyor in respect of the garage outbuilding structure; and by
whether there has been as dual appointment of private building
will be seen from our Reasons, we determine that Mr Herbig was not appointed RBS
in respect of the Shed, and as such there has
not been a dual appointment of
private building surveyors. Given this conclusion, it is appropriate that the
decision to serve the
Building Notice is quashed and the Building Notice itself
is cancelled, thereby disposing of the appeal.
contract between the Applicants and their builder for the Alterations was dated
15 July 2024 and had a contract price of $133,590.31
noted above, the Applicants signed a document titled ‘Appointment of
Private Building Surveyor’ dated 17 July 2024

building surveyor in respect of ‘alterations to existing dwelling’
First Herbig Appointment
Mr Herbig states that this document was received by him on 26 July 2024.
Applicants’ builder, Greg Lingham, applied to Mr Herbig for a building
permit by an application dated 22 July 2024 (
First Alterations
Application
Mr Herbig states
that he received this document on 26 July 2024. In that application, the nature
of the building work was described
as ‘internal alterations to dwelling,
newshed [sic], relocated carport’ and the cost of the building work was
to be $133,590.31.
on 27 July 2024, Mr Herbig states that he received a further document titled
‘Appointment of Private Building Surveyor’
Second Herbig
Appointment
This document
was also signed by the Applicants, and was also dated 17 July 2024. However,
the description provided of the proposed
building work to which the appointment
related was:
Alterations to existing dwelling, relocated carport
& new shed.
is apparent that the Second Herbig Appointment is the same document as the First
Herbig Appointment, except that the words ‘relocated
carport & new
shed’ have been added to the Second Herbig Appointment.
on 27 July 2024, Mr Herbig sent a letter to the Applicants confirming his
appointment as the relevant building surveyor
Alterations to
Existing Dwelling, New Shed & Carport
letter dated 30 July 2024, Mr Herbig notified the Municipal Building Surveyor of
the Alpine Shire Council pursuant to

building permit from Mr Lingham. That application
is also dated 22 July 2024,
it also states that the contract price for the building work is $133,590.31, but
states that the nature
of the building work is ‘internal alterations to

issue to be determined in this appeal is whether Mr Herbig was appointed as the
relevant building surveyor for the Shed. There
is no dispute that each of the
Alterations and the Shed was constructed with a building permit being in place.
However, if Mr Herbig
was the RBS for the Shed, then the Shed Building Permit
should have been issued by him and not Mr Kunze.
is clear from the chronology set out above, the confusion arises principally
from the Second Herbig Appointment which states that
Mr Herbig has been
appointed RBS in respect of the Shed as well as the Alterations.
the directions hearing in the BAB held on 20 May 2025, the Applicants stated
that they had only signed the First Herbig Appointment,
and that their builder,
Mr Lingham, had added the words ‘relocated carport & new shed’
to the already signed document
without their knowledge. At the same directions
hearing, Mr Herbig acknowledged that the additional words ‘may’ have
been added by Mr Lingham without knowledge of the Applicants, but that he, Mr
Herbig, had accepted the document from Mr Lingham as
agent of the Applicants in
good faith, and consequently he considered that he had been duly appointed as
the RBS for the Shed.
accordance with orders made by the BAB on 4 June 2025, the Applicants filed and
served evidence relevant to the above appointment
documents. By an affidavit
affirmed by Daniel Brown, the First Applicant, on 17 June 2025 (
Mr Brown sets
out his explanation for the differences between the First Herbig Appointment and
the Second Herbig Appointment. Mr
Brown states:
On the 17" July
2024, my wife, Jennifer Brown, and | signed a pre-filled form, provided by our
builder, Greg Lingham (trading as Altered
Dimensions), appointing Andrew Herbig
as a Private Building Surveyor for “
Alterations to Existing
” (filed as Attachment 3 to the Statement of Contentions I
submitted to the BAB on 17/3/25).
This is the only form we, the owners, signed regarding Andrew Herbig’s
appointment as a PBS.
There is no mention of a shed in the form we signed to appoint Andrew
We never signed any documentation to appoint Andrew Herbig as the building
surveyor for a shed.
Altered Dimensions was not contracted to undertake any building work outside
our existing dwelling.
Andrew Herbig issued me a Building Notice regarding my shed on the 18"
February 2025. I discussed the matter with Greg Lingham, the
builder who had
worked on our existing dwelling. We were both confused as to why Andrew Herbig
believed he had been appointed as
a PBS for the shed.
On the 19th February 2025 I located the original, and only, form my wife and
I had signed appointing Andrew Herbig as a PBS and sent
a photo of the form to
Greg Lingham. Greg asked to meet with me in person to discuss the matter on the
3 March 2025. At this meeting
Greg advised me that on the 26" July 2024 he
modified the appointment form my wife and I signed and dated on the 17" July
emailed it to Andrew Herbig without our knowledge or consent. Greg has
provided a statement affirming this in Exhibit 1.
1 to the Brown Affidavit is an email to Mr Brown from Mr
Further to our conversation regarding your appointment of
the Private Building Surveyor Andrew Herbig of Impact Building Approvals.
I completed the details on the original form and emailed it to you on the
15/7/2025 for you and Jenny to sign, it was returned on
the 17/7/2025. At that
point I had only included the Alterations to Existing Dwelling, as the proposed
building works on the form.
This form was sent to Impact Building Approvals on
the 24/7/2025.
I received a request for information letter from Impact Building Approvals on
the 26/7/2025 requesting that the Private Building Surveyor
Appointment form did
not include all of the proposed building work. It requested the property owner
to update to include all of the
proposed works forming part of the application
for a building permit. As I believed it was just a formality I updated and
the form on the 26/7/2025 to Impact Building Approvals without you or
Jenny's knowledge or consent.
Once again I apologies for doing, that and all the drama it has caused.
the basis of the Brown Affidavit, we are satisfied that the Applicants signed
the First Herbig Appointment, and that they were
unaware of the additions made
to the Second Herbig Appointment.
of the Act provides,
, that a builder who has entered
into a major domestic building contract ‘must not appoint a private
building surveyor on behalf
of the owner of the land on which the domestic
building work is to be carried out’. As such, it was not open to Mr
to appoint Mr Herbig as the RBS for the Shed.
each of the First Alterations Application, the Second Alterations Application
and the Alterations Building Permit stated
the value of the Alterations to be
the same as the Contract Price, and Mr Lingham was only appointed under the
contract to construct
the Alterations.
these reasons we find that Mr Herbig was only appointed the RBS for the
Alterations, and not for the Shed.
it follows, and we find, that Mr Kunze was appointed RBS for the Shed.
Accordingly,
we find that there was no dual appointment of private building surveyors in
respect of the Shed.
of the Act provides that a private building surveyor may only serve a
building notice under division 2 of Part 8 of the Act in respect
of a building
in relation to which the private building surveyor has been appointed to carry
out a function under the Act. As Mr
Herbig was not appointed as the RBS for the
Shed, he did not have the power to cause a building notice pursuant to s 106 of
to be served on the Applicants.
pursuant to s 149(1)(b) of the Act, we will quash the decision of Mr Herbig to
serve the Building Notice on the Applicants.
Further, pursuant to s 149(4) of
the Act, the Building Notice will be cancelled.
DETERMINATION: [DATE]
Clause 17 of Schedule 3 to the
Building Act 1993
provides: ‘Unless the Building Appeals Board
otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board must bear his,
or its own costs’.
