Tribunal Member Winter
REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
1. This is the Tribunal’s decision in relation to
complaints of direct discrimination and prohibited conduct made by both
Complainants.
2. Both Complainants alleged as against the Second Respondent
Carroll that he directly discriminated against them and displayed conduct
was offensive humiliating intimidating insulting or ridiculing, pursuant to
(1) of the Act respectively, on the basis of Complainants’ race
(a), and in the area of activity of employment,
complainants allege that the First Respondent ADCCO, has failed to comply with
its obligations pursuant to
of the Act.
4. Additionally, and after the
lodgement of his complaint , the Complainant Singh made an allegation of
victimisation as against the
Second Respondent Carroll, pursuant to
5. The complainant Makkar, also after the lodgement of his complaint,
also made an allegation of victimisation as against the Second
Carroll, but also against the First Respondent ADCCO.
6. The Complainant
Singh’s complaint against both Respondents was made to the
Anti-Discrimination Commissioner (“ADC”)
on 20 July 2015. His
address indicated in his claim form was Rosetta in Tasmania.
Complainant Makkar’s complaint against both Respondents was made to the
ADC on 2 September 2015. His address indicated
in his claim form was
Berriedale, Tasmania.
8. Following investigation by the ADC, and the failure
of the complaints to be resolved by a mediated outcome, both Complainants’
complaints against both Respondents were referred to the Tribunal for inquiry on
8 June 2017.
9. The ADC referral reports were dated 22 June 2017(Singh), and
26 June 2017(Makkar).
10. Although the victimisation complaint made by the
Complainant Singh against the Second Respondent was referred to the Tribunal
inquiry, the victimisation complaint made by the Complainant Makkar as against
First Respondent ADDCO and the Second Respondent
Carroll was not referred to
the Tribunal for inquiry as, per page 3 of the referral report of 26 June 2017
where it was stated “Please
note that following investigation of the
complaint by the former Commissioner, Ms Robin Banks, formed the view that it
did not disclose
possible victimisation”
11. At the time relevant
material was provided to the Tribunal by the ADC after 8 June 2017 the
parties’ contact details for
both Complainants, indicated residential
addresses in the State of Victoria.
12. In accordance with normal Tribunal
procedures, telephone directions conferences were conducted by Registry staff on
11 July and
8 August 2017.
13. From that date until the October period of
2018, efforts to resolve the complaints by conciliation were undertaken but
unsuccessful.
14. Consequently, an initial directions conference was
listed before the Tribunal and occurred on 7 November 2018.
15. From that
date until the commencement of the inquiry hearing on 10 April 2019, all
directions conferences were conducted with
both Respondents being present in the
Tribunal, with both Complainants participating by telephone.
16. By order
of the Tribunal dated 21 February 2019, both Complainants’ cases against
both Respondents were directed to be heard
together, pursuant to
Act which provides:
Tribunal may hold a single inquiry in relation to two or more complaints if they
arise out of substantially the same events.”
17. This order followed an order by the Tribunal on 12 December
2018 upon an application by the Complainant Singh, pursuant to
Act approving the withdrawal of his complaint from inquiry against the First
Respondent, ADCCO on the basis that he was
content with the apology made to him
by Mr Morris on behalf of the First Respondent.
18. Section 98(2) of the Act
Tribunal after considering an application under ss(1) may approve of the
withdrawal of the complaint from inquiry or
19. The Tribunal was satisfied on the Complainant Singh’s
application, and on the material before it at the date of the order,
complaint was withdrawn voluntarily, and that it was in the public interest to
20. After a final pre-inquiry directions conference on 2 April 2019,
the inquiry was set down for hearing initially for two days,
commencing on 10
April 2019.
21. After being adjourned at the conclusion of 11 April 2019, the
inquiry hearing continued on 10 May 2019, with evidence concluding
22. At the commencement of their evidence in chief, both Complainants
confirmed, under affirmation, that their residential addresses
23. In accordance with directions made by the Tribunal at the
conclusion of this final hearing date, both the Complainants and the
Respondents
provided written closing submissions. The Complainant Makkar’s written
submissions were received by the Tribunal
on 9 July 2019, as were those of the
Complainant Singh.
24. The First Respondent’s written closing
submissions were received by the Tribunal on 24 July 2019, and those of the
Respondent on 29 July 2019.
Consideration
25. On 18 April 2018 the High Court of Australia delivered its
decision in Burns v. Corbett [2018] HCA 15.
26. In the decision of
Shuttleworth v Pearson
[2018] WASAT 112
, and repeated in Sharma v Carlino
at 165 – 21, the State Administrative Tribunal of Western
Australia senior member Mr D Aitkin provided the following useful
relation to the decision Burns v Corbett (supra):
(iv) of the Commonwealth of Australia
Constitution
Act 1900 (Cth) (‘the
Constitution
’) provides that the High Court shall have original
residents of different States.”
(iii) of the
Constitution
empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to
make laws investing “any court of a State”, with federal
Judiciary Act 1903
(Cth) does that, subject to
various limitations
[18] Burns v Corbett concerned an appeal to the High Court from the decision
of Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales that the Civil
Administrative Tribunal of New South Wales (“NCAT”) did not have
a dispute arising under the
Anti-discrimination Act 1977
(NSW) (AD Act), between a resident of New South
Wales and a resident of another State – see Burns v Corbett at
[19] At all material times Complainant Mr Burns was a resident of New South
Wales, the Respondent to one of the complaints, Ms Corbett,
was a resident of
Victoria and the Respondent to the other complaint, Mr Gaynor, was a resident of
Queensland: see Burns v Corbett
[20] A majority of the High Court, (Kiefel CJ, Bell, Keane and Gageler JJ)
dismissed the appeal on the basis that:
‘The adjudicative authority in respect of the matters set out in
(iv) of the
Constitution
cannot be conferred on an organ or government, Federal
or State other than a court referred to in Chapter (iii) of the
Constitution
see Burns v Corbett at [45] [46] [64] [65] [69] and [121] (Note: the courts
referred to in Chapter (iii) of the
Constitution
are the High Court, Federal
courts and courts of a State which are therefore the only courts on which
federal jurisdiction can be
conferred.)
It was accepted by all parties that NCAT was not a court of a State –
see Burns v Corbett at [27]
The provisions of the Civil Administrative Tribunal at 2013 (NSW) (The NCAT
Act) which conferred jurisdiction on NCAT are invalid
to the extent that they
purport to confer jurisdiction on NCAT in relation to the matters between Mr
Burns and Ms Corbett and Mr
Gaynor, and pursuant to
Interpretation
(NSW) those provisions are to be read down so that they do not confer
Act where the
complainant and the Respondents to the complaint are ‘residents of
different States’, within the meaning
(iv) of the
Constitution
– see Burns v Corbett at [64, 119, 120].’
[21] In summary, the decision in Burns v Corbett was that:
‘The complaints by Mr Burns against Mr Corbett and Mr Gaynor were each
‘matters between residents of different States’, for the purposes
(iv) of the
Constitution
These complaints were therefore within federal jurisdiction and could not be
dealt with by NCAT since it is not a court of a State
and, therefore, cannot
exercise federal jurisdiction and
The provisions of the NCAT Act which purport to confer jurisdiction on NCAT
to deal with those complaints are to be read down so that
they do not confer
such jurisdiction’”
27. The Tribunal is not a “court of a State” within
the meaning of
Constitution
This has been authoritatively determined by the Full Court of the Federal Court
in Commonwealth v Anti-Discrimination Tribunal
[2008] FCAFC 104
(2008) 169 FCR 85per
28. Prior to April 2018, there had been no controversy with the
Tribunal dealing with matters involving allegations of a breach of
residents of other States against residents of Tasmania for discrimination or
prohibited conduct occurring in Tasmania
which thus enlivened the jurisdiction
of the Act.
29. From 7 November 2018 the Tribunal proceeded with its usual
interlocutory direction conference steps to ready the complaint for
the absence of its settlement by conciliated outcome or by approved
withdrawal.
30. It is clear however, on a review of the administrative
material provided to the Tribunal by the ADC, that at the date of the referral
of both complaints to the Tribunal on 8 June 2017, both Complainants were
residing in Victoria. The Tribunal thus proceeded on the
basis, and in the
absence of submissions to the contrary, that both Complainants were residents in
Tasmania when the complained of
conduct occurred, and when their complaints were
made against both Respondents in July and August 2015, and that it was thus
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to deal with them by way of the inquiry
powers prescribed in the Act.
31. Subsequent to receipt of the
Complainants’ and Respondents’ written closing submissions in late
2019, the Tribunal
commenced preparing its decision in relation to the inquiry
conducted through 2019. However, the delivery of the Tribunal’s
in Elizabeth Bertenshaw v Bruce Warner
[2020] TASADT 4
by the learned
Chairperson of the Tribunal on 25 May 2020, has had a significant impact on the
disposition of the bulk of the matters
the subject of this inquiry.
facts of Bertenshaw v Warner (supra) are not substantially dissimilar to those
pertaining to this inquiry.
33. In her well-reasoned decision in Bertenshaw
v Warner (supra), the learned Chairperson found in that case that the
or the “concrete justiciable controversy” as
between the parties arose at the time the ADC referred the complaint to
Tribunal for investigation - refer paras 20 – 27 inclusive of Bertenshaw v
Warner (supra).
34. The learned Chairperson from paragraph 28 then considered
whether, the parties in that matter were residents of different
35. The Chairperson cited with approval the further comments of
Senior Member Aitken in the Shuttleworth v Pearson (supra) decision,
was indicated from paragraph 42:
High Court has considered the meaning of the words ‘residents of different
States’, in
(iv) of the
Constitution
in a number of cases from which
the Tribunal draws the following principles:
(1) Only a natural person can be a resident: see the Australasian Temperance
and General Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited v Howe
[1922] HCA50: (1922 31
CLR290) “Howe’s case”, in which the High Court (Knox CJ, Gavan
Duffy J, and Higgins JJ),
held that the word “residents” in
Constitution
refers to natural persons only and not to artificial persons
or corporations. The High Court refused to reopen that decision in
Journeaux [1934] HCA72: (1934 52 CLR282) (Cox), again in Crouch v Commissioner
for Railways [1985] HCA69: (1985 159 CLR22),
in which the Court applied
(2) A natural person can only be a resident of one State at any time: see
Howe’s case at 296, where it was stated by Knox J
and Gavan Duffy J that
(iv) of the
Constitution
seems to assume that a resident of one State cannot
at the same time be a resident of another State.
(3) A resident is a natural person who resides permanently in a place which
is his or her home: see Howe’s case where it was
stated by Knox CJ and
Gavan Duffy J at 295, and by Higgins JJ at 327, that a resident is a natural
person who resides permanently
in a place. Also, in Howe’s case, it was
stated by Isaacs J at 324 that a natural person is a resident of the State
in fact, the nature of his residence shows it is his real home and also,
in Howe’s case, it was stated by Starke J at 327,
that a resident is a
natural person who lives, dwells, and has his home in some place.
(4) A natural person can be a resident of a State after residing there for
only a brief period of time: see RV MacDonald: ex-parte
MacDonald [1953] HCA35:
(1953 88 CLR197) (a month), RV Langdon: ex-parte Langdon [1953] HCA66: (1953 88
CLR158) (5 months), and RV
Oregon: ex-parte Oregon [1957] HCA18: (1957 97
CLR323) (2.5 months).
(5) There must not be residents of the State ‘on both sides of the
record’: see Watson & Godfrey v Cameron [1928]
HCA4: (1928 40 CLR446).
Mr Watson, who was a resident of Victoria, Mr Godfrey, who was a resident of New
South Wales, instituted
an action in the High Court against Mr Cameron who was a
resident in New South Wales. The High Court (Knox CJ, Isaacs, Higgins,
Duffy, Powers and Stark JJ), held that it did not have jurisdiction under
Constitution
to deal with the matter because it was not an action between
residents of different States. Knox CJ stated at 448 that where there
resident in New South Wales on each side of the record, then it is impossible to
say that the controversy is between residents
of different States. Higgins J
stated ta 449 that in his opinion the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs must be resident
in one State and the
Defendant or Defendants must be resident in another State
for the action to be between residents of different States.
(6) If a corporation is a party in a proceeding, it is precluded from being a
matter between residents of different States. In Cox,
an action was brought in
the High Court by a natural person resident of Queensland against a number of
natural persons who were residents
of Victoria and two companies which had been
incorporated in Victoria. Dixon J ordered that the action was to be dismissed
the Plaintiff elected to proceed only against the Defendants who were
natural persons, applying the decision in Howe’s case.
The Plaintiff
appealed the decision of Dixon J to the full court (constituted by Gavan Duffy
CJ, Stark, Evatt and McTiernan JJ),
which dismissed the appeal. In Rochford v
Dayes [1989] HCA17: (1989 84 ALR405) (Rochford), in a proceeding in the High
Plaintiff and the First and Second Defendants were natural persons
and residents respectively of New South Wales, Queensland, Western
Australia and
the Third Defendant was a corporation. In Rochford at 406, Gaudron J noted that
in Cox, Dixon J, at first instance,
held that the presence of a corporation on
the record had the effect of denying through a proceeding otherwise between
of different States to character of a matter “between residents
of different States”, as those words are used in
(iv) of the
Constitution
, followed that decision making an order that the action was
dismissed unless the Plaintiff elected to proceed only against the First
Second Respondents.
(7) The relevant date of a natural person’s residence is the date the
proceeding is commenced as opposed to the date of the
conduct in question in the
matter: see Watson v Marshall and Cade [1971] HCA33: (1971 124 CLR621-623) and
Momcilovic v The Queen
[2011] HCA34 at [134].
(8) A proceeding may become a ‘matter between residents of different
States’, after it has commenced and before it is
determined. If that
happens, the matter would then fall within Federal jurisdiction under
Constitution
. “Jurisdiction”, is the authority to adjudicate
or determine a matter which is to be distinguished from the law that
in the exercise of that jurisdiction: see Rizeq at [8] [9] [49] [50] [51] [52]
[127] and [128]. Therefore, although a
proceeding, when it is commenced in a
court or a tribunal, may be within State jurisdiction, the authority to
adjudicate under State
within Federal jurisdiction”.
36. The Tribunal agrees with and applies the principles
enunciated by the learned Chairperson in Bertenshaw v Wagner and thus
(a) Since the matter was referred by the ADC to the Tribunal
in June 2018, both Complainants were residents in Victoria and the Second
Respondent Mr Carroll was at all material times a resident of
(b) Although the Complainants and the Second Respondent Mr Carroll
were residents of Tasmania (the same State), at the time when the
discriminatory or prohibited behaviour occurred, and at the time the complaints
were made to the ADC in July and August 2015,
at the date the ADC referred the
complaint to the Tribunal on 8 June 2017, the Complainants were both residents
in Victoria and have
continued to be so.
(c) The Complainants can only be
residents of one State at any time. At the time this “matter”
arose, and when the issue
of jurisdiction is to be determined, both Complainants
were residents of Victoria.
37. It is for these reasons that the Tribunal finds that at the
time the matter arose in the Tribunal on 8 June 2017, the Complainants
Second Respondent Mr Carroll were residents of different States for the purposes
Constitution
. In the circumstances, following the decision of Burns v
Corbett (supra), the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with:
(a) The Complainant Singh’s complaints as against the
Second Respondent Mr Carroll (noting that on his own application, and
approval of the Tribunal, his complaint against the First Respondent ADCCO was
withdrawn on 12 December 2018) and:
(b) The Complainant Makkar’s
complaints as against the Second Respondent Mr Carroll.
38. These findings do not, however, resolve the outstanding
issues of the Complainant Makkar’s complaint as against the First
Respondent, ADCCO. This is so, following the High Court’s reasoning in
Burns v Corbett (supra), that only a natural person
can be a resident as the
word “residents” in
(iv) of the
Constitution
, refers to natural
persons only and not to artificial persons or corporations. (Refer to the
Australasian Temperance and General
Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Howe
[1922] HCA 50:
(1922) 31 CLR 290
( Howe’s case).)
39. The Complainant
Makkar’s complaints against the First Respondent ADDCO is brought on the
basis that the First Respondent
ADCCO has failed to comply with its obligations
pursuant to s104 of the Act.
Section 104
40. Section 104 of the Act provides:
“[104] Obligations
of organisations
(1) An organisation is to ensure that:
(a) Its members officers employees and agents are made aware of the
discrimination and prohibited conduct to which this Act relates:
(b) The terms of an order made under s89 relating to that organisation are
brought to the notice of those of its members, officers,
employees, and agents
whose duties are such that they may engage in conduct of the kind to which the
order relates: and
(c) No member, officer, or employee or agent of the organisation engages in,
or repeats or continues such conduct.
(2) An organisation is to take reasonable steps to ensure that no member
officer employee or agent of the organisation engages in
discrimination or
prohibited conduct.
(3) An organisation that does not comply with this section is liable for any
contravention of this Act committed by any of its members,
officers, employees,
and agents.”
41. In Chairperson Webster’s decision (as he then was),
in Maree Summers v. Department of Education and Ors
[2019] TASADT 8
he stated -
(paragraphs 113-114):
“[113] I agree with
the submissions of counsel for Ms Summers and the Respondents:
‘Section 104 only becomes relevant in the event there is a finding that
the Respondents have discriminated against Ms Summers.
If there is such a
finding then the onus is on the Department to establish it has discharged its
obligations to take reasonable
steps to ensure that its employees were made
aware of and did not engage in discriminatory conduct.’
[114] As there is no finding of discrimination I need not consider this
provision any further.”
42. In light of Chairperson Webster’s (as he then was)
decision, as there has been no finding of discrimination or prohibited
in relation to the Second Respondent, Mr Carroll, who, on the evidence before
the Tribunal, was an employee of the First
Respondent a ADDCO s104 is not
43. Consequently, as there is no evidence of a breach of the Act
by the second respondent Mr Carroll, the Complainant Makkar’s
complaint as
against the First Respondent pursuant to s104 cannot succeed.
Tribunal agrees with the comments of the learned Chairperson when she stated at
[37] of her decision in Bertenshaw v Wagner
preclusion of jurisdiction on this Tribunal to deal with this matter as a result
of the High Court decision of Burns v Corbett
(supra) is an unfortunate result
for the complainant(s). However, it is an issue that can only be rectified by
the Parliament of
45. For the reasons indicated above, the Tribunal makes the
following orders:
(a) Both Complainants’ complaints as against the
Second Respondent Lee Carroll are dismissed pursuant to s99 (2) (a) of the
on the basis that they are mis-conceived.
(b) The Complainant Makkar’s
complaint as against the First Respondent ADCCO pursuant to s104 of the Act is
unsubstantiated,
and is dismissed pursuant to s99(1) of the Act.
