Introduction
1. The Federal Court handed down its decision in
Newspapers Pty Ltd v Melbourne Chinese Press Pty Ltd &
on 22 August 2003. The case involved questions of trade mark and
2. The applicant, Australian Chinese
Newspapers, is the independent publisher and distributor of a daily
Chinese-language newspaper
in Australia. The respondents, Melbourne Chinese
Press and Chinese Times
Newspapers, control a competitor newspaper.
3. Australian Chinese
Newspapers claimed that the logo used by the respondents as part of the masthead
for its newspaper was too similar
to that used on its own newspaper. The
applicant contended that the logo adopted by the respondents created a confusing
environment, which enabled the respondents to increase their
newspaper’s circulation to the det riment of its own newspaper.
applicant had a registered trade mark in respect of its logo, the principal
cause of action was for trade mark infringement.
Alternatively, the
applicant claimed that the respondent had infringed the copyright in its logo,
which constituted an artistic work.
The trade mark claim
Both the applicant’s and the respondents’ mastheads are composed of
four Chinese characters. Three of the four characters
are identical. The
applicant’s logo has been used since 1996 and was registered as a trade
mark in October 1998. The applicant
claimed that the respondents’ logo,
adopted in September 2000, was deceptively similar to its logo, with respect
to the distinctive
combination of the characters used and the eye- catching
calligraphy style used.
5. The applicant introduced expert evidence to
establish that although there were differences between the mastheads, Chinese
would select a newspaper based on the overall shape of the newspaper,
rather than through a careful reading of the logo. In addition,
evidence was
adduced from two newsagents that there was
deception of members of
the public caused by the respondents’ change to its masthead in
September 2000. In contrast, the respondents’
introduced expert
evidence to establish that the differences between the logos were
“striking” and that Chinese readers
are “purpose
motivated” when selecting a newspaper and the use of a logo would not
affect their selection.
6. Conti J held that Australian Chinese
Newspapers had established that the respondents’ logo was deceptively
similar to its
own logo. The Court provided a variety of factors that led to
conclusion:
the logos were of similar size and
the only visually distinguishing feature is the third
both logos owe their origins and historical
development to the
style of font ;
buyers tend to look at the impact of the image of the whole layout of the
characters, and thus the logos look similar; and
the goods and
services in respect of which the applicant’s trade mark is registered
is the same as the respondents.
7. Conti J also found that the evidence
disclosed the existence of “a purpose adopted by the respondents to
deceive and confuse
buyers and prospective buyers of the applicant’s
newspaper with a view to attracting their patronage, as a consequence of an
initial mistaken or unintended purchase at the counter.”
8. The applicant pleaded that the respondents
infringed its copyright in the artistic work inherent in its logo. The artistic
was created by using a traditional Chinese brush pen applied to rice
9. Conti J held that the work was “sufficiently
expressive” for it to constitute a painting for the purposes of
protection. Further, the work is original enough for the subsistence
of copyright due to the knowledge, judgment, skill and labour
expended in the
production of the artistic work.
10. Given the finding of trade mark
infringement, Conti J held that a finding of copyright infringement was
“virtually inevitable”.
The Court found that a substantial part of
the work had been reproduced. The substantial part comprised the essence of the
two and fourth character’s of the applicant’s logo and the
visual impression of the totality of the logo. Further, His
Honour held that
there was “a measure of objective similarity between the
respondents’ most recent logo and the applicant’s
artistic work,
which has been rightly attributable by the applicant to copying, rather than
to mere use or reflection by the respondents
of an unprotected idea or
11. Conti J ordered that the respondents be restrained from
manufacturing, publishing, selling, supplying or distributing any newspapers
using the logo. The order was stayed for thirty days to allow the respondents
to design a new
