[2002] NSWRT 31
(19 February
STRATA SCHEMES MANAGEMENT ACT 1996
APPLICATION NO : SB01/00880
STRATA SCHEME : SP
ADDRESS OF : 155 – 159 Castlereagh Street,
SCHEME Sydney NSW 2000
APPLICANTS : The Owners
RESPONDENT : The Sushi House Pty Ltd (owner, lot 1)
The orders made by the Adjudicator on 13 December in application no. SA
01/00572 are stayed pending any order of the Strata Schemes
REASONS FOR DECISION
On 13 December a Strata Schemes Adjudicator made the following
I direct the owners corporation SP 22081 to do all things
reasonably necessary and within its power to facilitate the making of an
application to modify development consent to Sydney City Council, in the terms
of the proposed application put before the owners
corporation on 2 April 2001.
Those steps include but are not limited to indicating its consent to the
application and such other
documents as are necessary to allow the lodgement and
consideration of the application. This order is to be complied with promptly
no later than 31 December 2001, unless a further order provides
On 21 December 2001 the owner’s corporation lodged an
appeal to the Strata Schemes Board from this decision, together with an
application for a stay of those orders.
The stay application came before
the present Adjudicator on 2 January 2002, who directed that a copy be sent to
the respondent to
this application (the previous applicant) with a request for
the respondents submissions on the stay application. Those submissions
received on 14 January 2002.
The strongest point in the application for
the stay would appear to be the prejudice suffered by the owners corporation
stay not be granted, together with the costs incurred unnecessarily
in the consent at the Council, should the appeal be successful.
Further, once
the consent has been lodged it may set the application before the council on an
irrevocable path.
In their submissions in reply the respondents have not
addressed these issues.
The respondents submissions did indicate that
there was not a strong case for an appeal, and on present information that may
be so, however the parties before an adjudicator are only permitted to put
their case on the papers, and where the issue is one of
degree, such as here, it
may well be that a different decision is made after the parties have fully
presented their evidence in an
adversarial forum, where it can be properly
In any event, the respondent can apply for the stay to be lifted before the
