A notice made under s.
318 of the Legal Profession Uniform Law (Victoria)
Commissioner Determination (Unqualified legal practice)
[2018] VLSC 27
Date of Determination: 28 June 2018
Pursuant to s 299(2) of the Legal Profession Uniform Law
(Victoria) (‘the Uniform Law’), I have decided that the Respondent
Lawyer has engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct and I make the
following order –
Respondent Lawyer is reprimanded pursuant to s 299(1)(b) of the Uniform Law.
STATEMENT OF REASONS
Respondent Lawyer was admitted to practice in Victoria on 4 November 1998.
Respondent Lawyer applied for his first practising certificate on 19 April
15 March 2018, the Victorian Legal Services Board received an application for
the removal of the supervised legal practice condition
from an employee of [Law
practice] (the applicant).
application was based on the applicant having completed two years of supervised
legal practice pursuant to section 49(1)(b) of
the Uniform Law.
application consisted of a statutory declaration provided by the applicant and a
letter signed by the applicant’s supervisor,
the Respondent Lawyer, dated
13 March 2018.
Relevantly,
the applicant’s statutory declaration stated that:
applicant “
engaged in legal practice as an employee (or other, see
definition of 'supervised legal practice”
as per section 6 of the
Uniform Law and rule 7 of the Legal Profession General Rules 2015 (Vic))
[department]
of [Law practice]
supervision of [Name] who holds a practising certificate authorising them to
supervise legal practice by others”
letter provided by the Respondent Lawyer in support of the application stated
that the applicant had “
completed a continuous period of 2 years of
supervised legal practice from 1 February 2016 until 1 February 2018 ... under
my supervision
”. The letter also stated that the Respondent Lawyer
confirmed the contents of the applicant’s statutory declaration.
reviewing Board records, it became apparent the Respondent Lawyer last held a
Victorian practising certificate during the 2015/16
practising year which
expired on 30 June 2016.
21 March 2018, the Board wrote to the applicant seeking clarification on which
held a practising
certificate during the supervised period.
29 March 2018, the applicant contacted the Board and spoke to a Board
representative. The applicant stated that the Respondent
Lawyer had contacted
the Board for advice concerning his practising certificiate and that it would be
inappropriate for him to discuss
the Respondent Lawyer’s position with the
29 March 2018, the Respondent Lawyer applied for the grant of a 2017/18
Australian practising certificate. To that application,
the Respondent Lawyer
attached a written statement disclosing a potential period of unqualified legal
10 April 2018, the Manager, Practitioner Services wrote to the Respondent Lawyer
requesting further information pursuant to section
95 of the Uniform Law.
2 May 2018, the Respondent Lawyer provided a comprehensive reponse to the Board
request for information.
29 May 2018, the Legal Services Commissioner notified the Respondent Lawyer that
his conduct appeared to amount to unsatisfactory
professional conduct and
proposed a reprimand as an appropriate determination.
11 June 2018, the Respondent Lawyer consented in writing to the proposal to
determine his conduct as unsatisfactory professional
conduct and order a
Issues under investigation
suitability file was opened on 3 April 2018 to establish if the Respondent
Lawyer had engaged in unqualified legal practice.
issue under investigation here is whether the conduct amounts to unsatisfactory
professional conduct.
Relevant law
45(2) of the Uniform Law provides that the Board must not grant a practising
certificate if it considers that the applicant
is not a fit and proper person to
hold the certificate. In considering whether a person is fit and proper, the
Board may have regard
to the matters set out in the
Legal Profession Uniform
General Rules 2014
(the Uniform Rules), see s 45(3) of the Uniform Law.
relevant for the purpose of considering the Respondent Lawyer’s
suitability is r 3(d)(i) of the Uniform Rules which states
that the Board may
have regard to “...whether the applicant has engaged in legal practice in
Australia when not permitted to
do so under a law ... of a State or
Territory”.
10(1) of the Uniform Law states that an entity must not engage in legal practice
unless it is a qualified entity. A qualified
entity is defined in s 6 of the
Uniform Law as an Australian legal practitioner, and an Australian legal
practitioner is defined,
in turn, as someone who holds a current practising
certificate.
penalty for breach of this provision is 250 penalty units or imprisonment for
two years, or both. The objectives of the unqualified
legal practice provisions
is to ensure that legal work is carried out only by those who are properly
qualified and entitled to do
so and to protect clients of law practices (s 9 of
the Uniform Law).
296 of the Uniform Law states that unsatisfactory professional conduct includes
conduct of a lawyer occurring in connection
with the practice of law that falls
short of the standard of competence and diligence that a member of the public is
entitled to
expect of a reasonably competent lawyer.
298(a) of the Uniform Law provides that conduct consisting of a contravention of
the Uniform Law is capable of constituting
unsatisfactory professional
Findings of fact on issues under
investigation
key issue under determination is whether the Respondent Lawyer engaged in
unqualified legal practice.
Respondent Lawyer submits that his failure to renew his practising certificate
was as a result of changes in his administrative
staff during the 2015/16
renewal period. He states that as a matter of practice, his administrative staff
would check his emails
and bring relevant matters concerning his practicing
certificate to his attention.
Respondent Lawyer identified four client matters in which he was retained
through [Law practice] during the unqualified period.
Respondent Lawyer submits that is clear to him that the legal advice provided in
the four matters amounted to unqualified legal
Respondent Lawyer takes full responsibility for the failure to renew his
practising certificate and accepts that it is his obligation
to ensure he
maintains a current practising certificate.
Respondent Lawyer states that he is embarrassed and regretful of the impact his
failure to renew may have on his colleagues, clients
and the legal
is clear the Respondent Lawyer has breached section 10(1) of the Uniform Law by
engaging in legal practice without a valid practicing
certificate.
Determination & reasons
consideration of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I
determine that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the orders detailed above.
Respondent Lawyer’s consent to this course of action and orders was also a
reason for this determination.
to Section 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, or seek a
review by the
VCAT, of this determination made under s299 of the Uniform
