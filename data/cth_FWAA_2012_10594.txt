PERTH, 27 DECEMBER 2012
Application for approval of the Goldfields Baptist College Non-Teaching Staff Enterprise Agreement 2013-2015.
On 30 October 2012, Workplace Negotiations (WA) made application for approval of a single enterprise agreement to be known as the
Goldfields Baptist College Non-Teaching Staff
Enterprise Agreement 2013-2015
(“the Agreement”). The application was made pursuant to
Fair Work Act 2009
(“the FW Act”).
The Agreement was made following a ballot on 23 October 2012.
The application was the subject of correspondence between the Applicant’s representative and the Tribunal regarding subclause
18.5 of the Agreement. Following this communication, the matter was set down for hearing on 17 December 2012. At the hearing, the
Applicant sought that subclause 18.5 be deleted from the Agreement. The deletion of subclause 18.5 from the Agreement is not deleterious
or materially affect employees covered by the Agreement. The deletion has been reflected in the Agreement.
Fair Work Australia must approve an enterprise agreement pursuant to s.186 of the FW Act if the requirements set out in that section,
s.187 and s.188 are met.
I am satisfied, from the material provided to the Tribunal, that ss.186, 187 and 188, as are relevant to this application for approval,
have been met.
The Agreement is approved and will, in accordance with s.54(1) of the FW Act, operate from 3 January 2013.
The nominal expiry date of this Agreement is 31 December 2015.
