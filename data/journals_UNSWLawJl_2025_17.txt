CONVICT AND FORGET? THE FAILURE TO REMEDIATE 15,000
WRONGFUL CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS IN SOCIAL SECURITY
CHRISTOPHER RUDGE*
Studies of social security law in 21
Australia have justifiably focused on the Robodebt scandal. However, an earlier
welfare matter, described herein as ‘the
omissions affair’, equally
illustrates the injustices endured by Australian welfare recipients, as well as
the power dynamics
in Australia’s criminal justice system. Between 1991
and 2011, some 15,000 criminal convictions were recorded against apparently
innocent people for social security offences – though these matters have
long been ‘forgotten’. The first aim of
this article is to analyse
the decisions of the High Court of Australia that elucidated the principles
establishing these wrongful
convictions. The second aim is to consider the
varied impacts of these convictions, whether they could be appealed today, and
reforms, if any, could help avoid the recurrence of such miscarriages in
future. The article concludes by suggesting how the omissions
affair played an
important role in the eventual development of the Robodebt scheme.

Similarly, a lack of

these events occurred (and
when the government changed), may have reduced public
awareness of the omissions
However, for reasons
advanced in Part II, this historical episode is a complex but significant legal
problem that merits detailed
scholarly attention.
The first objective of this article is to analyse the two cases that
elucidated the principles that established this significant number
of wrongful
convictions. For reasons explained hereafter, I will describe these cases and
the events comprising this incident as
‘the omissions affair’.
Though the primary appeal cases have been subject to some commentary, no
sustained analysis of
the legal issues has been
undertaken.
Part II will thus
analyse the background and appeals preceding the delivery of judgments in
Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v
Poniatowska
Poniatowska High
Court Appeal
in the High Court of Australia. That Part will then consider the
Commonwealth Parliament’s attempt to enact a curative amendment
retrospectively close the so-called ‘loophole’ that had rendered so
many convictions unsound. The Part will subsequently
analyse the unanimous High
Court decision in
Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Keating
which found the retrospective operation of that amendment to be ‘a
statutory fiction’.
The second objective of this article is to explore a series of unresolved
questions arising from the omissions affair. It does so
in Parts III and IV.
Materials made available through Freedom of Information (‘FOI’)
requests and documents released
for the first time during the RRC will inform
this analysis. However, a lack of data means that the findings in these Parts
remain provisional. Part III considers the apparently small number of
appeals against convictions for omissions following the decisions
Poniatowska High Court Appeal
. It also analyses the
likely characteristics of the affected cohort, as well as the mental health,
employment and possible secondary
criminal liability impacts of those
convictions. As these convictions became known as ‘
convictions’ in the CDPP’s records system after
I will refer to
them as such hereafter. Part III also considers the nature of these convictions
as ‘wrongful’. Part IV
will consider post-conviction review in
Australia and the particular issues attending
convictions, such as finality. Drawing on the United Kingdom’s
(‘UK’) Horizon Scandal, this Part will
also consider possible
reforms to improve the Australian post-conviction review landscape.
Part V concludes by examining the connection between the omissions affair and
the Robodebt scheme. It argues that the omissions affair’s
significant
disruption to the ‘welfare prosecution system’, combined with
changes to Centrelink’s funding structure
in 2009, played a crucial role
in Robodebt’s emergence. While brief, it is hoped this analysis will
stimulate further research
into this historical connection.
II THE OMISSIONS AFFAIR
What I call the omissions affair comprises four key events:
• A criminal appeal in 2010:
Poniatowska v Director of Public
Prosecutions
Poniatowska Full Court
• The legislature’s response to that appeal in 2011, which
entailed the enactment of ‘curative’ criminal legislation;
• A second criminal appeal, heard in the High Court of Australia in
Poniatowska High Court Appeal
); and, finally,
• A separate criminal hearing in 2013 that challenged the retrospective
operation of the curative legislation identified above,
but was removed to the
High Court of Australia (
Each of these matters involved a determination of whether certain conduct by
persons in receipt of a social security benefit from
the Commonwealth Services
Delivery Agency, trading as
‘Centrelink’
gave rise to criminal liability. The central issue was whether a person in
receipt of a social security benefit who omitted to notify
changes in their
circumstances to Centrelink (or the Department of Human Services
of a criminal offence under section 135.2(1) of the
Criminal Code Act
’). Ultimately, the answer proved to be
as follows. Although it was theoretically possible for an omission to have
to a criminal offence before
the CDPP had long
misconceived the requirements of section 135.2(1) of the
Accordingly, the particulars, set out in the charge sheets that formed the basis
of omissions prosecutions, had been defective since
at least 2001, when the
offence was introduced.
Specifically, these charges were under-particularised and thus incapable of
satisfying the requisite elements of the alleged offence.
As was accepted in the
High Court, such charges, so particularised, disclosed no offence known to

in the same manner as it had

prosecutions were instituted following judgment in
for omissions
prior to 2011 – even though it would have been theoretically possible (if
relevant evidence existed to support
the prosecution) to particularise those
charges in accordance with the requirements revealed to be necessary in
Poniatowska High Court
The conclusion to be
inferred from this outcome is that an estimated 15,000 or more individuals have
been convicted on the same basis
as Ms Poniatowska – that is, on a
misconceived basis for an offence ‘unknown to law’ – between
(and possibly as early as

criminal law, few examples can compare with the number of unsafe convictions

While no doubt a
deeply tragic incident, it is notable that this matter involved fewer convicted
individuals than the omissions affair:
an estimated 900 wrongful convictions,
with some 200 of that cohort serving prison terms. Perhaps more relevantly, the
Horizon Scandal
has also been remediated, with 111 of those convictions being
and 2,800 affected
persons having received
compensation.
Another reason the omissions affair is significant is because its impacts are
comparable to other widely condemned scandals. While
the Robodebt scandal
affected a much larger cohort of some 648,000
and its impacts were
grave, it remains unclear whether any Robodebt victims were convicted of social
security offences for debts
wrongly asserted against them. While some documents
indicate criminal prosecutions were commenced (if not finalised) against
individuals,
no criminal
prosecutions or convictions are recorded in the report of the
Commission into the Robodebt Scheme
And a final
reason the omissions affair remains important relates to the broader narrative
of Australian social security law and
policy in the 21
century. As
I will suggest in Part V, the
Robodebt Report
has furnished some evidence
to suggest that the earliest development of the Robodebt scheme in 2014 was
driven by certain obstacles
to prosecuting welfare recipients raised by the
omissions affair, together with the financial implications of this episode for
and the DHS.
A Background to the Poniatowska
The omissions affair began in 2008 with the prosecution of Ms Malgorzata
Poniatowska. Poniatowska was an eligible recipient of a means-tested
security benefit known as the Parenting Payment Single
received the benefit in the early 2000s as a newly single
but continued to receive it when she entered full-time employment in
2006–07. As a property sales consultant, Poniatowska was

In May 2007, Poniatowska’s employment was
terminated.
However, she
continued to receive commission for services rendered while she was
Throughout this
period, Poniatowska was required to declare changes in circumstances to
Centrelink as an administrative norm. Indeed,
that requirement could have
transformed into a legal duty if certain information notices were issued and
However, Poniatowska
had been ‘taken off fortnightly reporting requirements’ in September
2005 and whether she received
any information notices was
In May 2007, Centrelink conducted an interagency ‘data

discrepancy between Poniatowska’s income declarations to the Australian
Taxation Office and to Centrelink.
During the compliance review that resulted,
Centrelink obtained further information about her income and, in March 2008, an

The charge sheet alleged Poniatowska had
received an overpayment of the PPS benefit of $20,162.58 by omitting to notify
of her income. In the Magistrates Court of South Australia,
convictions were recorded against Poniatowska on all 17 counts, and she

Poniatowska appealed to the Supreme Court of South Australia on the grounds
that the sentencing Magistrate erred in failing to consider

circumstances (the sexual harassment by her employer and her diagnosed
psychiatric illness)

conviction.

these contentions, finding that the Magistrate had considered

were to be ‘automatically’ referred
for investigation, regardless of
seriousness or potential
criminality.
While Centrelink’s investigation KPIs were formulated
‘in-house’, they were also set out in purchaser-provider agreements
– Business Partnership Agreements (‘BPAs’) made between
Centrelink and other government
Their significance was
that they identified revenue targets for deliverable activities, driving the
DHS’s ‘performance’
in prosecution investigations and
As Wilcock’s
analysis highlights, Centrelink’s funding had been tied to its performance
under these BPAs before 2009,
which had led to a corporatised
‘pseudo-market’ for welfare
Underlying the BPAs
was a quid pro quo. For its part, Centrelink would provide quality fraud
investigation activities to a partner
– activities
‘delivered efficiently and effectively’ according to Assurance
Expectation Matrices
reported in Centrelink’s Annual Assurance Statements (‘AAS’).
In turn, the partner agency would purchase those
investigation services, which
allowed both agencies to generate ‘program savings’ in social
security expenditure.
The BPAs incentivised prosecutions – not just because prosecutions were
tied to specific ‘dollar savings’ that contributed
overall required savings
but because they
required Centrelink to fulfill the BPAs’ deliverables to maintain funding
for its compliance activities.
In the 2008–10 period, low-ranking Centrelink officers were required to
complete just under 100 prosecution reviews, while
specialist officers were
required to refer around 60 briefs to the CDPP each year and achieve a minimum
acceptance rate of 85%.
2007–08 AAS, Centrelink achieved $1.5 billion in program savings and
exceeded its target for compliance
As Centrelink’s
revenue was primarily derived from these BPAs, its business operations depended
on achieving these prosecution
Although the BPAs were complex, the KPIs (as wholly quantitative measures)
were unsophisticated. They led FIT officers to refer mostly
trivial matters to
the CDPP ‘at the expense of progressing the more complex, serious fraud
investigations’.
Wilcock and Tim
contend, these referrals did not improve fraud detection but prioritised
short-term prosecutions directly tied to ‘achieving
savings’, thus
protecting Centrelink’s interagency revenue and programmatising welfare
recoupment.
The criminalisation
of welfare recipients in this period, as Wilcock propounds, reflected certain
‘neoliberal rationalities’
driven not by ‘inherently
punitive’ motivations but the goals of ‘increasing efficiency and
restraining welfare
expenditure’.
disciplinary forces of the criminal justice system were thus expropriated for
financial (rather than penological)
objectives.
In 2009, Centrelink
was able to directly appropriate its own funding, inaugurating what Wilcock
calls the ‘re-bureaucratisation’
However, as I will
suggest in Part V, the drive to reduce welfare expenditure remained intact after
2009. And this drive, I will
contend, led to the conception of the first
Robodebt program, an idea which followed the forced and unanticipated end of the
prosecution ‘system’, which was itself brought about by the
omissions affair.
C The Poniatowska

Consistent with this understanding, the majorities acknowledged that all

reference to chapter 2: ‘General principles of criminal
responsibility’.
issue in the Poniatowska appeals was section 135.2, which contained four
elements in paragraphs (a), (aa), (ab) and (b), as follows:
(1) A person commits an offence if:
(a) the person engages in conduct; and
(aa) as a result of that conduct, the person obtains a financial advantage
for himself or herself from another person; and
(ab) the person knows or believes that he or she is not eligible to receive
that financial advantage; and
(b) the other person is a Commonwealth entity.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months.
(1A) Absolute liability applies to the paragraph (1)(b) element of the
As the High Court majority observed, while paragraphs (a), (aa) and (ab)
require both physical and fault elements to be proved, no
fault element was
required for paragraph (b), to which absolute liability applies by reference to
section 135.2(1A).
Several social security cases had already considered the meaning of

The dispositive question in both appellate proceedings was whether the
prosecution case satisfied section 4.3(a). Both majorities
found it did not.
This conclusion rested not only on the terms of the

legislative history. First, the majority of the High
Court analysed the origin
of section 4.3, noting it had been ‘drawn

majority secondly analysed the origin of section 135.2, noting the offence
provision was first introduced in 2000, repealed and
remade in 2002, and then
amended in 2004 – the last change introducing the expression
‘engages in conduct’ into

In considering
this history, the majority made two findings. First, these amendments were not
intended to derogate from the omissions
principle but only to simplify the terms

did not ‘bring the offence [at section 135.2]

These dissentients
found the section had been intended precisely to criminalise omissions. And
certainly, as Wilcock observes, the
absence of a ‘dishonesty’ limb
under section 135.2 meant that the section had in fact ‘criminalised a
greater range
of behaviours’ than had been criminalised previously. Its
terms had made it ‘easier for the prosecution to prove

Many news reports, government media statements and even a professional

had exploited a ‘loophole’ to escape criminal
However, that
characterisation is contrary to the gravamen of the High Court majority’s
Although the
expression ‘loophole’ is undoubtedly nebulous, it has been described
as an ‘imperfection in the linguistic
formulation of a legal text’
that facilitates a ‘literal interpretation of that text’
inconsistent with an ‘interpretation
dictated by a good-faith application
of formal legal
reasoning’.
Contrary to
this formulation, the High Court did not identify or exploit any linguistic
defect in the text. Nor did it subject section
135.2(1) to a
‘literal’ construction. Instead, the majority arrived at its
conclusion by attending to the
’s unique system of
‘verbal formulae’, described above, and by considering its purpose

from the view that the criminal law should be certain and that its reach should
be able to be ascertained by those who are
the subject of it. Section 4.3 is a
reflection of those ideas. The exceptions to the general principle that it
states do not extend
to criminalising the omission of any act which is able to
be causally related to a result of
The majority thus rejected the argument that section 4.3 had the effect of
criminalising any act that could be ‘causally related

advantage). That, it found, would render
indeterminate.

However, the majority’s reasons indicate that the

minimum standard of knowability in the case of omissions. To engage the

could it be said of any criminal complaint before 2011, composed of similarly

? In the alternative, how would section 66A be relied
on in any future prosecutions for pre-2011 conduct in circumstances where the
legal duty imposed by section 66A had not, at the time of the offending,
existed? Could a defendant charged in 2010 for offences

commit those offences by omission even though ‘as a

by section 66A(2) of the
Administration Act
– which required
recipients to inform the DHS of circumstantial changes that might affect the
payment of their benefit –
could have retroactive operation so as to
‘create a duty from 20 March 2000’ and up to 4 August
As discussed below, the
unanimous High Court ultimately found that, on the CDPP’s construction,
section 66A(2) created a ‘statutory
fiction’ and did not impose that
retroactive duty.
The second question asked whether section 66A of the
Administration
was invalid insofar as its retroactive operation infringed the
separation of judicial and legislative powers under the
Constitution

an omission to comply with the
notices ‘engaging in conduct’ for the purposes of

provided that ignorance of the law would afford no excuse for criminal
liability).
All that was
required, rather, was that a recipient, as a matter of fact, had intentionally
failed to do an act; and that, as a matter
of law, there had been a duty to
perform that act.
However, as the High Court observed, that submission ignored that where there
was an ‘absence of a legal duty’ it was
immaterial whether the
defendant knew of that duty, much less whether ignorance afforded an
In short, the High
Court found that the ‘principal contention’ of the CDPP was
‘that s 4.3(b) is silent as to the
point in time at which the duty to act
is imposed’
therefore a ‘statutory fiction’ could be used to affix a duty to the
recipient at any point in time, even
retrospectively.
The unanimous High Court rejected this contention on two grounds. First, the

a recipient, the Court found, had to be ‘coincident with the failure to
discharge it’.
Accordingly, the enactment of section 66A on 4 August 2011 could not impose a
duty on Keating that was coincident with her omissions
to report her income
before that date.
3 Information Notices: Important or Immaterial?
In response to the prosecution’s alternative case, Keating advanced
three arguments contending that section 74(1) of the
Administration Act
did not criminalise a failure to comply with information notices for the
purposes of section 135.2(1). First, the alleged legal duty
was too uncertain;
second, it was ‘qualified’ insofar as it was contingent on a
person’s ability to comply; and
third, that the duty only arose in respect
of the offence regime of the
Administration Act
and could only be
understood in terms of the penalties prescribed under section 74(1). To construe
the duty under section 74(1) as
a ‘general duty’ extending to the
would ‘subvert’ this scheme of the
Administration
None of these
arguments quite succeeded.
Instead, the unanimous High Court found that an information notice issued under
Administration Act
was ‘capable’ of founding a legal duty to ‘do a thing’
for the purposes of section 4.3(b) of the
, such that omitting to
discharge the duty could amount to ‘engag[ing] in conduct’ for the
purposes of section 135.2(1)(a).
The High Court made clear that, in respect of any duty said to arise under
section 74(1), the prosecution would be required, first,
to prove that the terms
of the information notice on which it relied did in fact create the duty; and
second, that service had been
effected. As neither of these issues were raised
for consideration in the stated case, they could only be determined on remitter
to the Magistrates Court of
It became clear, subsequently, that relying on notices in the way the High
Court suggested would be difficult for several reasons.
As was said in the

Court to the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria, the CDPP withdrew the

D Are These ‘Wrongful
Convictions’?
While definitions of ‘wrongful conviction’
many scholars contend
that the expression refers to ‘factual innocence’: that is, where
the convicted person did not
in fact commit the wrongful act (such as where it
has been committed by another
Others, however,
accept that the expression encompasses ‘legal innocence’: where the
person did the act or omission in
question, but this did not, by reason of some
defect or exception in the criminal justice process, sound in criminal
responsibility.
However, the expression’s ‘elasticity, inconsistencies and
contradictions’ have also been
recognised.
David Hamer, for
instance, argues that while the conviction of a factually innocent person is a
more ‘searing’ injustice,
convictions against the legally innocent
are similarly ‘wrongful’ and to deny as much can be
‘counterproductive’.
Although the question of whether those with
convictions are factually or legally innocent has little import for the appeal
process (discussed below), it underscores
the fuzziness of the
factual–legal distinction, especially in the case of criminal
Recognising that
the ‘omissions principle’ poses particular problems for

, some scholars
have argued that omissions should be treated as ‘special’ –
that is, with particular
scepticism.
In any case,
where a person omitted to inform the DHS of income and there was no clear legal
duty to do so, it is consistent with
the English and Australian legal theory of
innocence to describe convictions of a person for that conduct as wrongful.
IV THE PATH TO
REMEDIATION
In recent years, post-conviction review has been subject to considerable
academic and public debate; and proposals for an Australian
version of the
UK’s Criminal Case Review Commission (‘CCRC’) have drawn
considerable support – and some
scepticism.
But the failure
by the Commonwealth Government or its agencies to review or otherwise engage
with the many likely wrongful convictions
resulting from the omissions affair
represents one compelling case for reform in this area.
A The Invisibility of Wrongful Convictions in
It is well-recognised that Australia lacks a dedicated system for tracking
wrongful convictions, which makes estimating the volume
of these convictions
unfeasible.
In 2015, the
Australian socio-legal scholar Rachel Dioso-Villa sought to create the first
national repository of wrongful
convictions.
Her study found
that there had been 71 wrongful convictions between 1922 and
A quarter of those 71
wrongfully convicted were sentenced to life imprisonment or death, while the
other three-quarters were sentenced
to custodial prison terms of, on average,
Dioso-Villa and others
hypothesise that the ‘real’ total of wrongful convictions in
Australia in that period is higher than just 71. After all,
Dioso-Villa’s
repository is limited to known cases (eg, those appearing in media reports and
elsewhere in the public domain)
and does not account for unreported
Unsurprisingly,
Dioso-Villa’s dataset did not include the estimated 15,000 wrongful
convictions arising from the omissions
Evidence from common law jurisdictions comparable to Australia suggests
wrongful convictions are generally underestimated. Since it
was established in
1997, the CCRC has referred 848 cases to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division
(‘CACD’), resulting
in 588 (69.7%) being
These data indicate
the value of a review body like the CCRC in revealing legal miscarriages and
facilitating appeals and judicial
remediation. Many empirical studies of
wrongful convictions in the US, where various ‘innocence projects’
have arisen
since the 1970s, have tended to focus on wrongful convictions
leading to capital punishment. A study authored by Michael Risinger
that between 1973 and 1989 some 2.3% of prisoners sentenced to death had been
wrongfully convicted; it also found that,
in one category of violent offending,
some 3.3% of cases involved wrongful
conviction.
Although lacking data, it is unlikely that Australia would be an exception to
these trends, especially since, as Blewer et al notes
generally, our criminal
‘processes are based on the same English common law
In 2014, Hamer
(adopting Risinger’s results) postulated that ‘we would expect about
350 convictions a year to be factually
wrong and left uncorrected by appeal,
with about 90 of these from
Still, as the
omissions affair demonstrates, unsafe or wrongful convictions in Australia are
liable to remain uncorrected in the
absence of any suitable review body. While
the estimated 15,000
-affected convictions may be distinguishable
from some other categories of wrongful convictions (as discussed above), the
of an institutional detection or correction system largely explains why
the omissions affair has received so little attention.
B Miscarriage, Finality and the
Possibility of Appeal
If it were possible to facilitate the appeal of these
convictions, what might be their prospects of success? Australian criminal
appeal statutes in each state jurisdiction adopt
what is called a ‘common
form criminal appeal
provision’.
these provisions vary and can be more complex, these provisions will generally
empower an appeal court to quash a conviction
where the trial verdict was
unreasonable, legally erroneous, or resulted in substantial
miscarriage.
standard ‘proviso’ allows the appeal court to dismiss an appeal
where it finds no substantial miscarriage
has arisen. It is arguable that a
-affected conviction (that is, involving no commissions)
will amount to a substantial miscarriage because, consistent with the reasons
the High Court, an omission to report income before 2011 could not amount to a
criminal offence in the absence of a particularised
duty. Nonetheless, the High
Court has also observed that ‘no single universally applicable description
can be given for what
is a “substantial miscarriage of
-affected convictions are very likely to have
pleaded guilty. In 2010, for instance, the Auditor-General found that 98% of
charged with offences under
section 135.2(1) pleaded guilty.
Perhaps more strikingly, 100% of all prosecutions led to
conviction.
As Caitlin Nash
and others have observed, however, Australian defendants who plead guilty may
face difficulties in later changing
this ‘judicial
confession’.
because, as the High Court has held, a guilty plea is to be taken as an
admission of all the ‘essential legal ingredients
of the offence admitted
by the plea’.
appeal courts will grant leave to appellants seeking to change their pleas with
a ‘caution bordering upon circumspection’,
including because there
is ‘high public interest in the finality of legal
proceedings’.
said, guilty pleas may nonetheless be changed if ‘it can be shown that a
miscarriage of justice has
circumstances where, as discussed above, the Court of Appeal in
Poniatowska
Full Court Appeal
accepted the notice of contention that a miscarriage had
occurred for the purposes of granting leave to appeal, it is likely that
-affected convictions could similarly show miscarriage.
As indicated above, the law recognises that finality serves many public
interests in the appeal process, as ‘a party should
not be twice vexed in
the same matter’,
both the victims and the community should be protected against further adverse
and because the
‘cost of litigation’ should be
restrained.
considerable time since the
decision (2013), and the even greater
-affected convictions themselves (recorded before
2013), considerations of finality will loom large in any appeal
In this respect, the
CDPP’s Fraud Manual – made public in 2023 through the RRC – is
instructive. It records that,
while ‘the original position [of the CDPP]
was to concede all appeals against
affected convictions’,
the Director approved a new approach on 6 May 2014 whereby the CDPP will
consider ‘opposing extensions
of time, relying on the principle of
finality, unless there is a satisfactory explanation for the delay’ or an
extension is
otherwise required by
In this regard, any
appellant would likely be required to explain why they had not sought leave to
appeal their conviction earlier,
although it is unclear what kind of explanation
might suffice.
C Addressing Post-conviction Inaction
Beyond the safeguard of the criminal appeals process, few mechanisms permit
reviews or remedies for suspected wrongful convictions

Another involves
releasing a prisoner ‘on licence’ in exceptional circumstances (as

mechanisms are expensive, time-consuming and, as Lynne Weathered posits,
unlikely to be established without substantial
As the omissions
affair illustrates, inaction on the part of both the public and government in
Australia may contribute to an environment
in which many wrongful convictions
remain uncorrected or ‘forgotten’.
As suggested above, an Australian CCRC may serve to remedy this inertia by
spurring both appellants and appeal courts to action. However,
two other matters
may briefly be raised to illustrate areas where reform might be considered, both
for individual wrongful convictions
and suspected large-scale miscarriages like
the omissions affair. It is first worth reviewing what might be called the
response’ of the CDPP and Commonwealth Government where
wrongful convictions are alleged. That position was illustrated by
the following
question on notice (asked by Senator Rachel Siewert) and answer (of the CDPP) in
What is the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions doing to identify
past prosecutions that may have led to wrongful convictions
in light of the
decision in [
] and communicating it to persons affected?
In relation to past convictions where the sentence has been served, the CDPP
considers each request from persons (or their legal representatives)
concerned that a conviction may be affected by the
Rather than taking proactive steps to inform the public, or to advise
individuals, about suspected wrongful convictions, the CDPP
adopts a passive
position. While this appears consistent with the prosecutor’s duty of
disclosure, which is generally discretionary
and owed to the courts (rather than
to the public generally),
apparent fact that the CDPP’s disclosure obligations will only be
enlivened when it receives a request from a concerned
person places considerable
limits on the
ability of affected parties to learn of their
predicament (another ‘hermeneutical
injustice’)
and thus to
access justice.
By contrast with the passive approach to wrongful convictions in Australia,
actions by the UK Government in the wake of the Horizon
Scandal appear
strikingly proactive. Responding to the prospect of large-scale miscarriages,
legislation was enacted in the UK and
Scotland to quash certain
‘convictions of dishonesty’ connected to the Horizon
Unsurprisingly,
these enactments have been roundly criticised for undermining the separation of
powers and circumventing the judicature’s
exclusive authority to review
convictions.
However, it is
arguable that where injustice occurs on a large scale, as may reasonably be
suspected concerning the omissions affair,
the numerous merits of such a
mechanism – efficiency, justice and remediation – warrant serious
consideration.
V CONCLUSION: SOCIAL SECURITY
CENTURY AUSTRALIA
This article has analysed a series of important events and legal cases not
previously studied in detail. Although the omissions affair
remains important in
its own right, material made public in 2023 through the RRC has shed further
light on the connection between
the omissions affair and the earliest conception
of the Robodebt scheme. Taken together, the omissions affair and the Robodebt
represent a deep structural problem in Australian social security law, a
full accounting of which is beyond the scope of this article.
concluding Part will explore an important historical bridge between these
events: the transformation of Centrelink’s
‘welfare prosecution
system.’ While that system first underwent change in 2009, it was
compelled to change again by the
omissions affair in 2013.
As illustrated above in
, before 2009, certain BPAs provided for
the transfer of funding to Centrelink from other agencies on the condition that
achieved certain performance targets, including fraud prosecution
From the mid-1990s
through to 2009, Centrelink depended on these BPAs to fund its departmental
activities. Wilcock has characterised
this period as one of corporatisation and
managerialism and the period after 2009, when Centrelink was permitted to
directly appropriate
funding for itself, as one of
‘re-bureaucratisation’.
However, what has not yet been considered is the precise way in which the
‘re-bureaucratisation’ of Centrelink in 2009
coincided and combined
with the omissions affair so as to give rise to the circumstances in which
Robodebt would be conceived.
As intimated in
, the omissions affair posed significant risks to the
Commonwealth in terms of the potential costs of remediating thousands of
convictions.
However, the omissions affair also threatened the effectiveness of
the ‘welfare prosecution system’ as it had subsisted
before 2011.
While Centrelink had not depended on prosecution referrals under the BPAs since
2009, the CDPP continued to depend on
Centrelink referrals for much of its
funding. In a 2015 letter drafted for (and signed by) the Secretary of DHS
(Kathryn Campbell)
to the Director of the CDPP, it was noted that ‘CDPP
funding is tied to the volume of briefs received per referring
As the letter
further explained,
Prior to November 2011, the department was able to lodge prosecution referrals
to the CDPP with short-form briefs ... The CDPP’s
decision to change this
policy and require a full brief for all referred matters meant that fewer
investigations could be completed
by the department without a significant
increase in resourcing. This has reduced the number of prosecution referrals in
recent years.
As this letter further suggested, in June 2013, following the outcomes in
, the CDPP Director had decided that no past prosecutions would be
commenced where a matter was ‘entirely
mid-2014, the CDPP further introduced three new charging policies for
‘Centrelink Omissions’ into its practice instructions;
they required
‘full brief[s] for all referred matters’ to be provided to the CDPP
and identified strict conditions for
the prosecution of commission- and
omission-related conduct.
indicated in the Secretary’s letter, these changes had not only reduced
prosecution referrals from Centrelink to the CDPP
but had seen the CDPP’s
‘funding reduced’ for the 2013–14 period, with ‘a
reduction of $11.182m (11.8%)
from the previous
The effect of the post-
policy changes was to preclude the
prosecution of welfare recipients for overpayments occurring before 2013. When
Centrelink was
re-bureaucratised in 2009, it had already been disincentivised to
refer individuals to the CDPP; however, now that most (if not all)
referrals for
section 135.2(1) offences would require long-form briefs of evidence, Centrelink
was doubly disincentivised to persist
with the welfare prosecution system of the
2000s. Indeed, despite a loss of funding (noted above), the CDPP was also
disincentivised
to prosecute welfare recipients in light of the complications
arising in the omissions affair.
It is therefore notable that the target of the first iteration of the
Robodebt scheme when it was conceptualised in early 2015 was
uninitiated PAYG compliance matches from the 2010–11, 2011–12 and
2012–13 financial
This was the
very cohort for whom the prosecution system had now become unviable. And given
that an estimated 40% of all prosecutions
between 2001–11, there would have been concerns from June 2013 that not
only would prosecutions be more complicated
than before, but that many of these
compliance matches would have been unprosecutable – even with more
resources committed
to that end. In short, the omissions affair engendered the
very conditions in which an alternative ‘civil’ system of
policing, such as Robodebt, was required. That system had to address the same
compliance matches that had previously been
managed (and flagged) through the
now-unfeasible welfare prosecution system. While more analysis of this
connection will increase
understandings of welfare law in the 21
century, it is clear that Robodebt was not (only) a sui generis product of
misguided policymaking but the somewhat predictable result
of both internal
changes at Centrelink (‘re-bureaucratisation’) and external
developments in Australia’s criminal
jurisprudence (the omissions
As this article has endeavoured to show, this omissions affair represents a
complex and important event in Australian legal history,
with wide implications
for social security law and the limits of criminal responsibility. While the
Poniatowska High Court Appeal
decisions have resolved
several questions of law relating to criminal omissions, they also indicate that
many thousands of people
have been wrongfully convicted. Without increased
attention to this miscarriage, the possibility of remediation may soon pass.

Although, as I will suggest
Part III(A)
, many people were likely incarcerated for these convictions.
While considerations of
this kind remain speculative only, it is notable that the Terms of Reference for
the RRC imputed a start
date of 1 July 2015, with the result that the RRC did
not substantively investigate connections between the omissions affair and
design of the scheme: see
Robodebt Report
(n 1) vol 1, x–xii.
Nevertheless, some reporting during the RRC considered the impact of the
omissions affair: see Rick Morton,
‘Robo-Debt Shonky from the
The Saturday Paper
(online, 20 February 2021)

See discussion of the
parliamentary debates in
Part II(D).
It may also be that, until each of these
miscarriages has been reviewed by the courts, they will be regarded as
hypothetical only;
or, as was said in the second reading speech for the
Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011
(‘Social Security Amendment Bill’), the offences will be regarded
merely as ‘previously unidentified legal technicalities’:

Poniatowska Full Court Appeal
Centrelink is the agency
responsible for administering social security programs under the
Commonwealth
Services Delivery Agency Act 1997
(Cth), although that Act was renamed in
2011 as the
Human Services (Centrelink) Act 1997
While at the time of these
events the agency was the Department of Human Services (‘DHS’), it
is now known as Services
Australia. See Services Australia,
Annual Report
(Report, 1 October 2020) 162.
As discussed below, the
reasoning of the unanimous High Court in
(n 12) confirms that,
for any conviction before 2011 based on a reporting omission to have been valid,
the CDPP would have had to
have alleged and proved to the criminal standard
that: the defendant received an information notice issued under sections
and 70A of the
Administration Act
(n 12); that the terms of
the information notice imposed an obligation or duty on the recipient to
‘do a thing’ for the
purposes of section 4.3(b) of the
(n 6) (regardless of whether it also imposed a duty under section 74 of the
Administration Act
(n 12)); that the recipient then intentionally failed
to comply with that duty; and that this intentional failure to comply resulted
in the recipient obtaining a financial advantage from Centrelink knowing or
believing that they were not eligible to receive that
financial advantage: see
(n 12) 474–6 [33]–[39] (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan,
Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ). While the CDPP could and did particularise
allegations in respect of the charges against Ms Keating, that was only possible
because the matter was still pending when
it was heard, on removal, in the High
Court. It would not be possible, as illustrated in
Poniatowska High Court
(n 28) for the CDPP to alter any charge sheet in any appeal of a
decision where a conviction had already been recorded.
See below n 139.
That a criminal charge
sheet or information must be precise and set out the factual ingredients of the
offence has been long recognised:
John L Pty Ltd v A-G (NSW)
[1987] HCA 42
(1987) 163 CLR 508

Johnson v Miller
[1937] HCA 77
(1937) 59 CLR 467
, 486–7 (Dixon J), 501 (McTiernan J).
It was acknowledged during
the leave hearing for
Poniatowska High Court Appeal
(n 28) that the case
would likely lead to criminal appeals and monetary risks for the Commonwealth.
As Gummow J said, ‘you
want special leave to determine some major point of
principle which involves a lot of money to the Commonwealth’: see

Despite the contents of these documents, it is logically unlikely that many, if
any, Robodebt victims were convicted due to the response-dependent
nature of the
scheme. Those accused of receiving overpayments were sent letters requesting
further evidence of their income. Those
who responded with further evidence may
have permitted the Department of Social Services (‘DSS’) to
recalculate the debt
manually, converting the alleged debt into a debt
calculated in accordance with law. If any such person was prosecuted, the
complaint would arguably have not been based on a Robodebt (albeit
originating as an alleged Robodebt). By contrast, those who did
not cooperate
were likely to have had the alleged debt garnisheed from their tax returns or
the debt pursued by private debt collectors;
however, it appears no such persons
were subject to criminal prosecution.

As Tim Prenzler noted after
the affair, ‘referrals and prosecutions were abandoned in large
numbers’: see Prenzler,

The timing of these

After her employment ended,
she received 17 lump sum payments totalling $71,502:
Poniatowska Full Court
(n 32) 580 [2] (Doyle CJ and Duggan J).
The source of this
‘requirement’ has long been ambiguous. While section 67(2)(a) of the
Administration Act
(n 12) authorises the Department to send recipients
certain notices requiring information, and section 74 of the
Administration
(n 12) makes non-compliance with such notices an offence, there was no
contention in the Poniatowska appeals that a section 67 notice
had been sent to
Poniatowska, nor that she had failed to comply for the purposes of section
74(1). As the High Court stated, ‘[i]t
[was] not alleged that the
respondent was under a duty imposed by a law of the Commonwealth to advise
Centrelink of the receipt of
those payments’:
Poniatowska High Court
(n 28) 411 [2] (French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ). See also
Channel Seven
(n 53) 89–90 [463]–[469] (Blue J). To ensure
the ambiguity did not continue, section 66A was inserted into the
Administration Act
(n 12) in 2011. The CDPP’s Prosecution Manual
indicates that the duty to report changes in income was removed from the
legislation
in 1991: see ‘CDPP Fraud Manual’ (n 7) 36 [12.8].
Being ‘taken off
reporting’ could occur for several reasons; however, it often occurred
when a recipient honestly reported
no earnings for a fortnight and made no
further reports for three successive fortnights thereafter. See, eg,
‘Characterisation
of Social Security Fraud as Omission or Commission
Offending’ (Instruction No 4, Revenue & Benefits Fraud Practice Group,
Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, 19 December 2014) 1 [5], [7], 2
[15] <https://www.cdpp.gov.au/system/files/2023-05/PGI-RBF-004.pdf>
(‘Charging Instruction No 4 2014’).
A history of data matching
appears in the
Robodebt Report
(n 1) 11 [6.1]. While
‘cross-match’ and ‘cross-check’ capabilities are
described in the Department of Social
Security, Parliament of Australia,
Annual Report for Year 1975–76
(Parliamentary Paper No 239/1976, 21
September 1976) 73, those capabilities were limited: see ‘Savings Paper
Social Security:
Increased Matching of Records between Australian Taxation
Office (ATO) and the Department of Social Security (DSS)’ (Memorandum
6339, 9 March 1989) 2, 4 [6]. Even in 1989, there had been a ‘question
mark over that practice [as] the Privacy Commissioner
had raised an issue about
its legality in light of recent tax file number and privacy legislation’:
Robodebt Report
(n 1) 11 [6.1]. Also see discussion of the program and
its use in aiding in prosecutions: ‘Program Protocol: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)
Data Matching May 2004’ (Program Protocol, Centrelink, May 2004) 5 [2.1].
The data-matched information was held by the Australian
Taxation Office and
Centrelink in its reporting records: see
Poniatowska High Court Appeal
28) 415 [18] (French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ).

Australia, 1 February 2011) 1
<https://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/a20-2010/Poniatowska_Chrono.pdf>
(‘Chronology’).
A potentially unjust aspect
of the way the offence appears to have been charged and prosecuted in this
period relates to ‘continuous
omissions’ and the failure of the CDPP
to ‘roll up’ offences committed by omissions conduct. Continuous
could occur in the following manner. A person who earned income in a
first fortnight but omitted to notify Centrelink of that income
would commit an
offence. That person could then earn no income in the second fortnight, and omit
to make an income report, but commit
no offence. The person could then earn
income in the third fortnight and, as in the first fortnight, again omit to
report it to Centrelink,
thus committing a second offence. In these
circumstances, a person would be charged with committing two offences under
section 135.2(1)
(n 6), despite the person’s conduct
forming one continuous omission. While Poniatowska’s 17 counts of omission
were ‘rolled up’ into one offence, pursuant to
section 4K(4)
Crimes Act 1914
’), this was
not common: see
Poniatowska Supreme Court
(n 52) [1] (David J). Cf
Pride v The Queen
(2010) 11 DCLR (NSW) 154
in which two immediately successive omissions were charged as two sequences of
section 135.2(1).

Poniatowska High Court Appeal

substituted with ‘there is a duty
to perform by a law of the Commonwealth,
a State or a Territory, or at common law’. This extended the range of laws
be capable of giving rise to criminal liability for an omission under
section 135.2(1) by reference to section 4.3(b) of the
(n 6). As the
majority noted in
Poniatowska High Court Appeal
(n 28) 421 [32]
(citations omitted): ‘The Code adopts a more restrictive approach to
liability for the omission to act than
does the common law. This is because
“the law” to which section 4.3(b) refers is a law of the
Commonwealth. Section 4.3(b)
does not include obligations imposed under the
general law’. Following this 2013 amendment, however, the High
observation would no longer be applicable, as section 4.3(b) would
now pick up obligations imposed under Commonwealth, State and
Territory and

While there was
reference made in the Full Court to the possibility that sections 67(2) and 77
Administration Act

purposes of section 4.3, it was noted the prosecution ‘did not rely on any

J’s dissent, neither he nor the majority

miscarriage in the Poniatowska

supplied in circumstances where a defendant is ‘to be apprised not only of
nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the
particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge’:

12), the CDPP contended that the prosecution was not required to prove, as a
matter of law, that the intention-based fault element
of section 135.2(1)(a)
involved an intention to breach a legal duty. However, the unanimous High Court
found this was immaterial
because ‘the failure to do a thing is not an
offence in the absence of a legal duty to do the thing’. In other words,
no prosecutor would ever be in a position to prove a legal duty had been
breached where it could not be shown that such a duty existed
in the first
(n 12) 478 [45], 479 [48] (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan,
Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ). Nevertheless, in circumstances such as those
by Heydon and Sulan JJ, whose dissents reject the requirement for a
duty to be identified, it would still be necessary to consider
how and whether
the ‘intention’ fault element in section 135.2(1)(a) is made out.
However, their Honours’ separate
dissents do not address this
requirement.

In 2018, Sevel observed
that ‘[t]he character of legal knowledge has received scarce attention
from philosophers of law’
and while ‘obedience to law allows for
such knowledge to take many forms’, a ‘person who obeys [the law]

a legal norm as an authoritative directive and allows that fact
to make a difference, both causal and normative, in the production
action’. See Sevel (n 161) 210, citing GEM Anscombe,

that convictions dating back
to that year may be affected by the decision.
Poniatowska High
Court Appeal
(n 28) 424–5 [45].
As discussed below in
Part III(B), there were several New South Wales matters subject to warrant and
annulled when
Poniatowska Full Court Appeal
(n 32) was decided. As the
Explanatory Memorandum for the Social Security Amendment Bill (n 26) noted that
‘the CDPP has adjourned
or discontinued a large number of matters of this
kind before the courts’ and will be ‘not commencing new proceedings
of this kind, pending the determination of the appeal before the High
Court’: Explanatory Memorandum,
Social Security and Other Legislation
Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011
(Cth) 5. When the removal hearing
(n 12) was heard in the High Court, evidence adduced by the
Commonwealth indicated that 330 current prosecutions involved omissions
350 Centrelink briefs (presumably already referred to the CDPP but not yet
directed for prosecution) involved omissions:
Keating HCA Transcript
(n 30) 3 (DS Mortimer SC).
The CDPP had not relied
on these sections in any past prosecutions: see Commonwealth,
Parliamentary
, House of Representatives, 6 July 2011, 7832 (Tanya Plibersek,
Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister for Human Services);
(n 12) 477 [41] (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).
This is how the
Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (intervening) framed the matter in its
amended submissions: see Attorney-General
(Cth), ‘Amended Annotated
Submission of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (Intervening)’,
Submission in
DPP (Cth) v Keating
, M5/2013, 27 March 2013, 4–5
Notably, while the
Robodebt Report
(n 1) describes the operation of sections 68 and 66A of
Administration Act
Robodebt Report
(n 1) 9, 19 n 63),
it does not provide any explanation of its origin in the
Social Security and
Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Act 2011
(Cth). While
section 68 of the
Administration Act
(n 12) empowers the Secretary of the
Department of Social Services or their delegate to seek information about events
of circumstances affecting a person’s social security payment,
it imposes no standalone obligation on the person to update
the Department of
any such changes. Instead, section 66A(2) imposes that obligation.
[19]–[23] (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).
Ibid 468 [2], 469
These were the terms of
(n 6) s 4.3(b) before an amendment was made by the
Crimes Slavery
Amendment Act
(n 114) sch 1 item 1. That amendment changed the meaning of
‘law’ in section 4.3(b) to include not only a law of the
Commonwealth, but also a State or Territory law or a common law. As this
amendment was not retrospective, however, it did not apply
to Keating, and the
duty referred to in section 4.3(b) had to be derived from a Commonwealth law.
The CDPP contended that the relevant
law for that purpose was section 66A of the
Administration Act
(n 12): see

However, it might be
said that the second argument – that the duty under section 74(1) of the
Administration Act
(n 12) was a ‘qualified’ duty – was
partially accepted by the unanimous High Court. The Court’s reasons imply
that a duty might not arise if imposing a legal duty is not within ‘the
scope of the obligation created by the notices, which
are in varying
if service of the notice cannot be deemed to have been
effected or the notice was not received by the defendant; or finally, if the
‘form of the charges’ (ie, the particulars) is defective: ibid

Of course, for criminal liability to arise under section
135.2(1) of the
, the recipient would also have to have the other elements proved
against them: that they had received a financial advantage as a
result of the
omission conduct under subsection (1)(aa), and that they knew or believed they
were not eligible to receive that financial
advantage under subsection
See Explanatory
Memorandum,
Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous
Measures) Bill 2011
(Cth) 5. This Explanatory Memorandum also reveals a
different concern regarding s 6A of the
Administration Act
Section 6A operates to deem decisions made by computer programs under the
Secretary’s control decisions of the Secretary.
However, the concern
expressed in this Memorandum – that information notices issued to social
security recipients may not have
complied with section 6A – indicates that
the legislature had concluded that prosecutors would be unable to prove to the
standard that the Secretary had ‘arranged for the use, under the
Secretary's control, of the computer program(s) to make the
decision(s)’ for the purpose of this section. As this was regarded as yet
another reason why those convicted previously
might have unsound convictions,
the Bill deemed the requirements of s 6A(1) to have been satisfied
retrospectively for the period
12 June 2001 to Royal Assent: see sch 3, item 1.

Human Rights Commission’s finding in
BE v Suncorp Group Ltd
that an employer had discriminated against a job applicant on the
basis of his child pornography convictions. The previous regulations
employers from discriminating on the basis of any criminal record, unless the
criminal record related to the ‘inherent
requirements’ of a
position; however, arguably, after this change in regulations, the ability of
employers to discriminate
has widened.

There is an apparent
paradox in mapping the concepts of ‘factual’ or ‘legal’
innocence onto omission conduct,
and this may emerge from the fact that criminal
omissions are rare, and thus will often not be recognised as crimes –
by omitters nor witnesses. Indeed, the very
omission as a criminal wrong may depend on the content of ‘legal’
rules not readily apparent or intelligible to
lay (non-legal) actors nor, as the
omissions affair suggests, even to administrators of the law.
