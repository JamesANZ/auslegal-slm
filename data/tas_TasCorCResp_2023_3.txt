Hazell, Nancy (2023 TASCD 173), Responses [2023] TasCorCResp 3 (3 April 2023)
Response received from Queenborough Rise 16 August 2023
Following the death of Mrs Hazell we developed a tool within our clinical care system to prompt staff to conduct regular safety checks
of all chair sensors within the facility. This tool reminds staff to conduct a safety check every shift. This observation is then
documented within our clinical care system.
Correspondingly, the ‘Purposeful Rounding Chart’ was reviewed and now includes the following check: “Check if the resident has
a bed sensor, chair sensor calls bell and/or pendant-functioning and or near the resident before leaving the room”. This chart
contains a list of actions that must be undertaken for each resident every hour.
As well, every six months scheduled testing of the nurse call bell system is competed by an external provider. The chair sensor mats
work through this system. The scheduled testing was last completed in May 2023.
Other measures we have taken include
The Coroner’s findings were discussed at our local site quality meeting and the actions were documented in our Continuous Improvement
The Coroner’s findings were discussed at the Regional Executive Team meeting. This meeting is attended by all senior clinical managers
from around the state. As a result all sites now closely monitor the use of motion chair sensors
The Coroner’s findings were also discussed in the Senior Executive Team meeting.
