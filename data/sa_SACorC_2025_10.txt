Reason for inquest

sentence of imprisonment.
October 2019 Mr Foster was sentenced for offending that he pleaded guilty to.

for prior criminal
offending the year before. He was sentenced to a cumulative term of
imprisonment of three years, 11 months and
11 days, which commenced on 15

or 1997. Following their separation, Mr Foster

another two years before moving in with his parents to care for
Mr Foster maintained an
amicable relationship with his ex-wife and daughters and remained involved
throughout their childhoods.
Foster was placed into the care of the South Australian Prison Health Service
(SAPHS) upon being remanded into custody. There
was no relevant medical history
noted at this time.
Events leading to death
Tom Turnbull was the Medical Director of SAPHS at the time of
Mr Foster’s incarceration. Dr Turnbull provided an affidavit
summarising the issues leading up to Mr Foster’s death.
he was initially incarcerated in 2019 Mr Foster was admitted to Yatala Labor
Prison, before being transferred to Mount Gambier
Prison on 20 February 2019.
2019 and 2021, Mr Foster experienced various health issues, including nausea,
bursitis of the hip and vitamin B12 deficiency
for which he received medical
28 April 2022 Mr Foster was sent to the nurse with signs of jaundiced skin and
eye sclera. He complained of a dry, non-productive
cough for the previous three
months, and that his urine was orange and his bowel functions chalky and loose
for the previous six
weeks. He also complained of a reduced appetite over the
last two weeks. The following day he was examined by Dr Kavanagh, a medical
officer employed by SAPHS, who noted Mr Foster’s liver was not enlarged
and his abdomen was not tender. A referral was made
for a CT scan of his
abdomen and pelvis, as well as a referral to the Mount Gambier Hospital.
CT results were discussed with Mr Foster on 3 May 2022. They revealed signs of
suspected bile duct cancer. A magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography
(MRCP) was recommended and Mr Foster was advised he would need surgery. Mr
Foster agreed to the surgery.
11 May 2022 Mr Foster reported experiencing issues with his bowels. He was
given medication by the nurse.
18 May 2022 Mr Foster was feeling dizzy and losing balance. His bowels were
still problematic for him.
21 May 2022 Mr Foster was admitted to the Mount Gambier Hospital where the MRCP
was performed. It showed a mass lesion at the
confluence of the hepatic ducts
of the porta hepatis, which supported the diagnosis of bile duct cancer.
21 May 2022 Mr Foster was transferred to TQEH.
23 May 2022 he had a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography insertion. This
procedure involved transhepatic insertion of a
needle into a bile duct, followed
by injection of contrast material to opacify the bile ducts. The procedure was
technically difficult
and complicated by hypotension, and Mr Foster had to
remain in the Intensive Care Unit for some time before he was discharged to
ward on 24 May 2022. His liver function gradually improved, and he was
considered a suitable candidate for

planned a right hemi-hepatectomy

Mr Foster’s bilirubin levels were monitored in the leadup to the surgery,
and he was noted to be clinically well. The surgery
was completed without
complications.

subsequently deteriorated with worsening decompensated
liver failure and
fluctuating confusion attributed to hepatic
encephalopathy.
case was reviewed at an MDT meeting on 22 June 2022. The consensus opinion was
that once Mr Foster had recovered from surgery,
he should be referred to medical
oncology and consideration be given to adjuvant treatment.
on 26 June 2022, Mr Foster developed disseminated intravascular coagulation,
which is a rare but serious condition causing
abnormal blood clotting. Despite
intervention, Mr Foster developed fulminant acute liver failure and failed to
show any meaningful
clinical improvement.
family meeting was held on 27 June 2022 and a decision was made for Mr Foster to
be referred to the palliative care team.
Foster remained under palliative care until he died in the early morning of 1
and recommendations
agree with the conclusion reached by the SAPOL investigating officer in this
matter, Detective Brevet Sergeant Daniel Rolevink,
that Mr Foster’s
custody at his time of death was lawful.
Foster’s death was the result of a medical condition which was unable to
be corrected despite appropriate medical and surgical
measures taken by medical
staff both in custody and in hospital. I have no concerns regarding the care
and treatment Mr Foster was
afforded in custody or in hospital.
