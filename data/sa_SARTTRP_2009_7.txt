This application was made to obtain possession of the site on which Mr Mann
has a dwelling at the Elizabeth Village residential park.
Mr Mann entered into the above site agreement in January 2008 but Mr Mann
died on 18 October 2008. Since then the only contact the
park owners have had
for Mr Mann is his executrix and trustee, Ms Vanessa Tiernan.
At the hearing on 4 August 2009, the Tribunal heard sworn evidence from Ms
Tiernan and two representatives of the Residential Park,
Mr Robert Ashby and Mr
Barry Graetz.
The Residential Parks site agreement described above, comes under the
Residential Parks Act, 2007
(“the Act”). Insofar as it is necessary
I make a finding that the site agreement terminated under
Section 52(f)
Act as the resident died without leaving dependents in occupation of the rented
Ms Tiernan was appointed Mr Mann’s executrix and trustee under his will
which is still undergoing the process of Probate. Ms
Tiernan is being assisted
by solicitors, Armour and Allen, but no one from that office was available to
attend the hearing on 4 August
Mr Graetz explained that the Park has been trying to locate Ms Tiernan and
arrange for the dwelling and site to be relet but they
had lost contact with Ms
Tiernan. Ms Tiernan agreed that, since separating from her partner, she has not
had mail referred to her.
Ms Tiernan has been waiting for Probate to be
The park owners served a notice of termination on 18 May 2009, on the basis
of rent arrears. They hoped that by serving the notice
they would have a
response from Ms Tiernan.
The park owners are willing to work with Ms Tiernan so that Mr Mann’s
dwelling can be sold and the site relet.
The difficulty, according to the park owners, is that the dwelling is now
substandard. Significant work is required, particularly
in relation to the
electrical wiring, to make the premises safe and saleable.
As a result of discussions between the parties at the hearing, an agreement
was reached as to how to proceed on this application.
Despite being entitled to an order for possession of the premises, the park
owners will work with Ms Tiernan to finalise Mr Mann’s
estate. The
parties agreed to adjourn this hearing. In the meantime, Ms Tiernan will
arrange for repairs to be done to the dwelling
on the site and for the dwelling
to be marketed for sale. The parties expected this process to be successful
within the next two
months. Once the dwelling is sold, Ms Tiernan undertook to
pay the outstanding rent. As at 31 July 2009, this has been calculated
$3791.75. Rent was paid to 8 November 2008, when Mr Mann died. Rent has been
calculated at $96.00 per week from 9 November 2008
to 6 February 2009, and
$101.75 per week from 6 February 2009 to 31 July 2009. Rent is accruing at the
rate of $101.75 per week.
The parties understood that once the dwelling is sold rent will be paid from
the proceeds of sale. Ms Tiernan expects this money
to be distributed through
her solicitor’s Trust Account and expected to be able to provide the park
owners with a letter from
her solicitors undertaking to pay the outstanding rent
before disbursing the balance of the estate to Ms Tiernan.
The following order is made by consent.
1 I adjourn the hearing of this application to a date and time to be
2 I record the agreement reached between the parties that:
Tiernan, acting on behalf of the estate of the late Mr Greville Mann will use
her best endeavours to have the dwelling at site
98, Elizabeth Village repaired
and will take all reasonable steps to market the dwelling for resale.
owing under the site agreement to the date of giving up possession of the site
(subject to any further order of the Tribunal)
will be paid by Ms Tiernan, on
behalf of the estate of the late Mr Greville Mann from the proceeds of sale of
the dwelling.
