where the Council appealed against the refusal of the primary judge on the
appeal to the Planning and Environment
Court to set aside the stormwater
infrastructure charges and some of the traffic trunk infrastructure charges
– where one of
the grounds of appeal was that the legal approach of the
primary judge was in error – where the Council succeeded on the appeal
the reinstatement of the traffic trunk infrastructure charges only and did not
obtain leave in respect of the ground based on
the legal approach of the primary
judge – where considerable time in the hearing of the application for
leave to appeal was
spent considering the legal approach of the primary judge
– whether the outcome of the appeal should be characterised as
“contestable”
– whether the Council should recover the costs
for leave to appeal and the appeal

reasons), the parties were invited to file written submissions on the
appropriate costs orders. They have now done so.
[2] We will use
the same designations for the parties that were used in the reasons. The
Council’s primary submission is that
the respondents should be ordered to
pay the Council’s costs of the application for leave to appeal and of the
this primary submission does not succeed, the Council’s
alternative submission is that it should be deprived only of a relatively
proportion of its costs, say no more than 20 per cent, on the basis the
Council’s success in the proceeding was substantial
and that should be
reflected in the Council’s recovery of a substantial amount of its
[3] On the basis
each party achieved a measure of success, the respondents characterise the
outcome of the application for leave to
appeal and the appeal as
“contestable” which is to borrow a description used by Kiefel and
Keane JJ in
Plaintiff M76/2013 v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural
Affairs and Citizenship
[2013] HCA 53
(2013) 251 CLR 322
and by the court in
Firebird Global Masterfund II Ltd v Republic of Nauru (No 2)
[2015] HCA 53
. The respondents therefore submit that it is appropriate that
there be no order as to costs.
[4] There was no
dispute between the parties as to the matters of principle that apply in
determining the question of costs.
[5] The court
invited submissions on costs due to the parties’ mixed success on the
appeal (at [116] of the reasons). The Council
was not granted leave to argue
there was an error in the legal approach of the primary judge to the appeals in
the P & E Court,
the Council was not successful in overturning the decision
to set aside all stormwater infrastructure charges, but the Council was
successful in overturning the decision in relation to the traffic trunk
infrastructure charges. There was no appeal by the respondents.
[6] The monetary
outcome of the appeals is relevant. The stormwater charges that were set aside
in the P & E Court amounted to
$1,127,228.75 (and that remained the
position), and the traffic trunk infrastructure charges that were reinstated
amounted to $965,910.28.
[7] The Council
had to pursue the appeal in order to recover the significant quantum for the
traffic trunk infrastructure charges.
That has to be balanced, however, against
the not insignificant time spent in connection with the application for leave to
on the Council’s ground for which leave to appeal was not granted
concerning the legal approach to the appeals in the P &
E Court and the
reasons for why that leave was not granted (at [74] of the reasons).
[8] In view of
the significant monetary success for the Council in the appeal, the outcome
should not be characterised as “contestable”.
The starting point is
therefore that the general rule is that costs should follow the event, but in
the circumstances of this matter,
some deduction should be made for the time
spent on ground 1 and, to a lesser extent, the lack of success the Council had
in relation
to the stormwater charges.
[9] The costs
order should be:
The respondents must pay two-thirds of the
appellant’s costs of the application for leave to appeal and the
