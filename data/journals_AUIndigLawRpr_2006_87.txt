Executive Summary
Following earlier research conducted by Murdoch University in the Court of
Petty Sessions, Perth and Fremantle, on a communitarian
model of transformative
and restorative justice, discussions took place with communities interested in
pursuing a similar range of
processes of working among offenders, victims, and
their collective communities.
Together with the Prison Reform Group of WA, Murdoch University’s
Centre for Social and Community Research engaged in discussions
with already
known and respected Indigenous leaders working in Roebourne, Western Australia.
From this early dialogue, ideas were
fleshed out to engage in developing a model
suitable for local people living in the region. During this time, the Office of
Prevention called for expressions of interest from universities wishing to
apply for funding for ‘community safety’ research
initiatives, and
Murdoch University was successful in applying for funding to cover the 18 month
project, in partnership with the
Prison Reform Group of WA.
The project broadly aimed to examine how communities could develop and
introduce a communitarian restorative approach to the aftermath
of crime; one
that attempts to be locally driven and sustained by grass-roots leadership
whilst supported by the police and justice
sector. It looked to see how a
process which is inclusive, reparative and supportive of victims, and provide
the means for offenders
to take responsibility for their actions, could be
initiated and sustained. The project was concerned with the processes required
to establish a grass-roots responsive model that was feasible and able to be
implemented rather than evaluating any particular model
of justice. The project
had to address two of the key funding priorities of the Office of Crime
Prevention: the creation of civil,
robust, resilient communities and crime
reduction and prevention systems.
Researchers found that local Indigenous community members already suffered
from high arrest and incarceration rates, poor quality
and overcrowded housing,
under-employment, and a myriad of other socially excluding circumstances.
Against this, several community
members expressed the desire to be included in
reinstating local customary systems of respect and preventing crime and
anti-social
activities through alternative means. Many of these people
continually provided energy and a willingness to develop processes for
common good whilst struggling themselves. Such was the level of resilience.
Networks were built up around key people including those engaged with the
Aboriginal Legal Service, Community Development and Employment
Program, Court
Services, Aboriginal Visitor’s Scheme, Aboriginal Medical Service and
other local Aboriginal Corporations. A
small group of people joined a loosely
coordinated steering committee that gave oversight to the early stages of the
project. A similar
group was established among key stakeholders in Perth as a
reference group with an ability to collect and disseminate information
to the project.
Several theoretical constructs were discussed by both Perth and Roebourne
groups, including restorative, transformative and procedural
justice as well as
therapeutic and problem solving court processes. Attention was given to local
ideas and difficulties, and to providing
possible scenarios for policy makers to
consider when applying the process elsewhere.
