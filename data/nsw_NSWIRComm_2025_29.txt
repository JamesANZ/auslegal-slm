decision deals with consent applications to make 30 new awards in respect of
workers employed by NSW Health, replacing 30 existing
awards that are beyond
their nominal term.
October 2024, the Secretary of the Ministry of Health (Health Secretary) and the
Health Services Union (HSU) reached agreement
on a Memorandum of Understanding
(2024 MOU). The 2024 MOU included a commitment for the parties to work
cooperatively and in good
faith during the life of the 2024 MOU to consolidate
and modernise more than 50 Awards and Determinations, with the aim of reaching
consensus for new industrial instruments to apply from 1 July 2025.
11 November 2024, the Health Secretary filed an application for a dispute under
Industrial Relations Act 1996
(NSW) (the Act) as a
vehicle for the modernisation of these awards to come before me. Since then, I
have listed that matter for a
report back on 1 April 2025, 18 June 2025, and 19
August 2025.
joint submission filed by the parties prior to the report back on 19 August 2025
stated that pending finalisation of the modernisation
process NSW Health had
made an offer to the HSU on 5 August 2025 for an 8.5% increase in salaries and
salary related allowances to
staff covered by HSU awards (other than paramedics)
over two years, in the following form:
(1) 4.5%, effective from 1 July 2025, inclusive of the statutory 0.5% increase
in superannuation, and
(2) 4.0%, effective from 1 July 2026.
offer contained a proposal for a new 2025 MOU which would enable a continuation
of award reform negotiations which aim to consolidate
some 30 plus awards and 20
related determinations to about 6 awards. It also contemplated consent in
advance for the parties to be
able to make applications to arbitrate to
resolution listed matters that the parties identify are likely to not be able to
be resolved
by conciliation.
18 August, the HSU responded to NSW Health and informed it that a majority of
members had accepted NSW Health’s offer. At
the report back on 19 August,
the parties informed me that they would finalise the terms of the new 2025 MOU
that would, amongst
other things, record an agreement to make consent
applications for the awards that are the subject of this dispute to give effect
to the pay increase and specify the extent to which it was accepted that the HSU
could make applications to arbitrate certain issues.
foreshadowed, on 29 September 2025, the Health Secretary filed 30 consent
applications for the awards that are the subject of this
7 October 2025, the Health Secretary filed an affidavit from Alice Murphy, the
Director of Industrial Relations and Change at NSW
Health, in support of the
applications. Ms Murphy is an experienced practitioner with many years’
experience who holds a very
senior position within NSW Health. As such, I can
place weight on her opinions, noting they are
uncontested.
Memorandum of Understanding
consent applications reveal that the parties entered into a new MOU on 18
September 2025. That MOU is referred to in the no extra
claims clauses in each
award, which are in the following terms:
“The parties have agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding on 18 September
2025 in relation to claims impacting this Award.
Consequently, this clause does
not preclude the parties from pursuing arbitrated outcomes in the Industrial
Relations Commission,
consistent with the terms of the MOU, which can take
effect as determined by the Industrial Relations Commission.
The Industrial Relations Commission recognises that other than the matters dealt
with in, or contemplated by the agreed MOU, or as
otherwise provided for in the
Industrial Relations Act 1996
, parties have given an undertaking not to pursue
further claims/demands or proceedings instituted before the NSW Industrial
Commission for extra or reduced wages, salaries, rates of pay,
allowances or conditions of employment with respect to the Employees
the Award that take effect prior to the nominal expiry of the Award unilaterally
made by a party to the Award unless otherwise
agreed by the parties.
This clause does not prevent the Parties from continuing collaborative
discussions during the life of the Award to deliver additional
enhancements to
remuneration and/or conditions of employment, and to achieve additional industry
wide and systemic efficiencies and
productivity improvements to the delivery of
Government services to the public. Changes to conditions or salaries may be
progressed and, if agreed, an application to vary the Award may be made
by consent prior to the nominal expiry of the Award.”
her affidavit, Ms Murphy stated that the no extra claims clauses in the proposed
awards are intended to facilitate the ongoing
award reform process outlined in
NSW Health’s letter of offer to the HSU on 5 August 2025 (attached as
Annexure A to her affidavit)
and the HSU’s letter of acceptance on 18
August (attached as Annexure B). In Annexure A, the NSW Health Secretary
the expected terms of the MOU:
“The Ministry of Health proposes to enter into a new Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) for the classifications outlined in
Annexure B of the 2024
MOU. The Ministry of Health is committed to the continuation of the award reform
The Ministry agrees with the HSU's proposal to consolidate existing awards. Part
of this consolidation would be consideration of
the creation of a singular
Health Professionals Management Classification scale.
While the Ministry of Health agrees to create these new awards, the terms and
conditions and classification structures contained
will continue to be
negotiated. To this end the parties will commit to a further period of intensive
negotiations to be completed
by November 30, 2025. In accordance with the NSW
Government Fair Pay and Bargaining Policy 2024-25, the Ministry consents in
to having the Allied Health, Health Professionals, Ambulance Managers,
and Ambulance Non-Paramedic Control Centre Awards arbitrated
if there is no
agreement after this time.”
NSW Health Secretary also proposed that the MOU would include consent in advance
to the following matters being referred to the
Industrial Relations Commission
after 1 July 2026 for arbitration if no agreement can be reached:
“1. Enforceable rights to uninterrupted meal breaks, and a ten-hour break
between shifts and recalls to duty (10-hour break
between shifts agreed
2. Additional days of sick and carers leave (consistent with the conditions in
the Crown Award).
3. Continued negotiation with the Ministry of Health around Union Delegate
4. Improved consultation about workforce changes and workload management.
5. Amalgamation of the core conditions award with the exclusion of matters that
have an identifiable cost to NSW Health.”
Content of the awards
her affidavit, Ms Murphy deposed that the proposed awards:

five awards at
Consideration
am satisfied in light of the evidence that the proposed awards set fair and
reasonable conditions of employment and that it is appropriate
to make the
awards pursuant to
of the Act.
doing so, I have regard to the fact that the proposed awards provide equal
remuneration and other conditions of employment for
men and women doing work of
equal or comparable work, pursuant to
of the Act. Ms Murphy gave
evidence that the proposed awards provide equal rates of pay and allowances,
eligibility criteria for
employment, duties, and conditions of employment for
men and women under each job classification.
also consider that the evidence indicates that the making of these new awards
will be in the public interest, pursuant to
of the Act.
emphasise in that regard the evidence given by Ms Murphy that these awards are
part of a broader process to reform NSW Health Awards,
which has involved
“extensive collaborative discussions” and “ongoing cooperation
between the parties towards substantive
award reforms”, and is reflective
of the parties’ focus on cooperative workplace reform and productive
workplace relations.
That process
continues to progress under my supervision, but it is important that delays in
the finalisation of that modernisation
process do not prevent suitable wage
increases occurring in the meantime, lest that cause the workforce to lose
confidence in the
note that the proposed awards reflect the offer made by the Health Secretary
which I infer would not have been made if the NSW Government
had determined it
was inconsistent with its fiscal position. That is confirmed by the evidence of
Ms Murphy that, to the best of
her knowledge and belief, the Government has
considered the effect of the proposed awards on its fiscal position and outlook
the NSW economy.
