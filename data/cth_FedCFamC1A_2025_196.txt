REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
AUSTIN, HARPER & BRASCH JJ:
way of a Notice of Appeal filed on 12 June 2025, the appellant complains the
primary judge dismissed her
Application in a
Proceeding filed on 17 March 2025, which sought 90 purported interim orders that
can only be described as a blancmange
of statements, complaints, assertions,
irrelevancies and contradictions.
interlocutory orders the subject of this appeal were made on 20 May 2025 (as
amended on 18 June 2025), with
reasons delivered on 20 May
2025. The appellant initially appealed against each of the nine interlocutory
orders, but, at the appeal
hearing, revised the suite of orders against which
she appeals as follows:
1 and 2 of the [appellant’s] Application in a Proceeding filed on 17 March
2025 (to remove the Independent Children’s
Lawyer) be dismissed.
balance (paragraphs 3 to 90 inclusive) of the [appellant’s] Application in
a Proceeding filed on 17 March 2025 be dismissed.
Independent Children’s Lawyer is to do all acts and things to secure
funding from Legal Aid and organise for the preparation
of a report from [the
psychiatrist] (“the psychiatric report writer”) to be made available
to the Court, with such report
to deal with:
(a) The mental health and functioning of the [appellant] and [respondent];
(b) The extent to which any mental health issues impact upon the [appellant] and
the [respondent’s] parenting capacity;
(c) Any treatment, therapy or plan that could be undertaken by the [appellant]
and the [respondent] to improve their wellbeing and
parenting capacity;
(d) Any other matters that the psychiatric report writer considers important to
the welfare or best interests of the child.
parents attend for interviews on 18 June 2025 as directed by the Independent
Children’s Lawyer with the psychiatric report
writer and participate fully
as requested by the psychiatric report writer, [the psychiatrist].

The appellant’s interim application for orders
share the primary judge’s lament in the reasons for judgment that it is
hard to discern coherent orders sought by the appellant
in her Application in a
Proceeding in furtherance of these parenting proceedings. For example, she
sought an order for DNA testing
of the father’s child from another
relationship, who is not the subject of these proceedings (cl 26 of her
Application in a
Proceeding).
appellant also sought orders for the father to be referred “for Criminal
Investigation and Prosecution” (cl 42).
She sought many orders about
disclosure of matters to do with a “Fraudulent Letter” authored by
her own mother (cll 31–41
and 49–50) and sought authorisation for
her (the appellant) to use it “in External Proceedings” (cll
also proposed the child’s time with the father be stayed (cl 56), but then
sought an order that the father not take the
child outside of the
City F and Region M area
THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
the grounds of appeal (much like the Application in a Proceeding) are
misconstrued as to what constitutes orders that can
be appealed, the touchstone
that is relevance, what constitutes grounds of appeal and the fair application
of germane legal principle
– and by that we refer to the appellant relying
on non-existent or obsolete sections of Acts and rules, and citing cases which
do not exist or do not stand for the propositions contended.
is also unclear how many of the grounds shed light on the purported errors
arising from the relevant parts of Order 3 and Order
8 of the 20 May 2025
principles relevant to bias were restated by the High Court in
Charisteas v Charisteas
[2021] HCA 29
(2021) 273 CLR 289
as here, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge,
the applicable principles are well established,
and they were not in dispute.
The apprehension of bias principle is that “a judge is disqualified if a
fair-minded lay observer
might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not
bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required
to decide”. The principle gives effect to the requirement that justice
should both be done and be seen to be done, reflecting
a requirement fundamental
to the common law system of adversarial trial – that it is conducted by an
independent and impartial
tribunal. Its application requires two steps: first,
“it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge
to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits”; and,
secondly, there must be articulated a “logical
connection” between
that matter and the feared departure from the judge deciding the case on its
merits. Once those two steps
are taken, the reasonableness of the asserted
apprehension of bias can then ultimately be assessed.
five judges of this Court said in
Johnson v Johnson
, while the
fair-minded lay observer “is not to be assumed to have a detailed
knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability
of a particular judge, the
reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the
context of ordinary judicial
(Footnotes omitted)
the test to be applied is “whether a fair-minded lay observer might
reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring
an impartial and
unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to
Johnson v Johnson
[2000] HCA 48
”)). The majority added at
... At the same time, two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to
be reasonable; and the person being observed is
“a professional judge
whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require [the judge] to discard
the irrelevant, the
immaterial and the prejudicial”.
(Footnote omitted)
conclusion of apprehended bias “must be firmly established and should not
be reached lightly” (
Re JRL; Ex parte
[1986] HCA 39
(1986) 161 CLR 342
must deal with the issue of bias first because, as the High Court explained in
Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design &
Developments Pty Ltd
[2006] HCA 55
(2006) 229 CLR 577
and [172], the necessary
result if bias is established is a rehearing.
the hearing on 20 May 2025, the appellant did not make an application for the
primary judge to recuse himself. Certainly, she
complained about him in an
affidavit, but she did not include an application for recusal in her Application
in a Proceeding, nor
make an oral application for same. That makes it hard for
the appellant to now complain.
4 is to the effect that by Order 1 of the 11 November 2024 orders, the primary
judge had “recognised the necessity of
disclosure”. All that order
provided for was to grant the appellant leave to file an Application in a
Proceeding. The appellant
referred to this as her disclosure application. The
appellant’s characterisation of the subject matter about which she wanted
to depose cannot imbue the primary judge with an affirmation of anything.
ground added at Part C(4), that when the primary judge had “affirmed the
necessity of disclosure” (not that he did
so), it was then inconsistent
for him to summarily dismiss the Application in a Proceeding.
ground conflates two entirely different things – the grant of leave to
file an Application in a Proceeding on one hand,
and on the other, the primary
judge’s subsequent consideration of that on its merits.
ground must fail.
11 is headed “Manifest and Systemic Bias – Apprehended Bias”
by “directing one party’s submissions,
ignoring filed material,
penalising the Appellant while excusing the ICL and Father”. The
appellant also refers to her rights
Human Rights Act 2019
cannot see where or how the primary judge directed one party to do anything of
the kind. Instead, long gone are the days a judge
sits “inscrutable as
the sphinx” (
at [13]). The purported costs order (which
may be the reference to the appellant being penalised) was not made against the
rather the ICL’s costs were reserved. The appellant can take
whatever steps she thinks appropriate elsewhere under the
Human Rights Act
(Qld), but that is not a matter for this Court or the primary
transcript reveals the primary judge bent over backwards to hear from the
appellant, asking her time and time again if she had
anything else to say.
is not demonstrated simply because a judge makes an adverse finding about a
SCAA v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs
[2002] FCA 668
). Nor is bias
established simply because a party disagrees with the outcome of the
proceedings. In
Feldman v Nationwide News Pty
[2020] NSWCA 260
(2020) 103 NSWLR 307
, Bell P (as he was then known) said at [43] with
Macfarlan JA and Payne JA concurring, “the fact that the primary judge
rejected the appellant’s case for a variety of reasons does not
and cannot demonstrate actual or apprehended bias”.
though for Grounds 4 and 11, the appellant’s lack of application for
recusal at the hearing constrains her from doing
so now. Indeed, “when a
party is in a position to object but takes no steps to do so, that party cannot
be heard to complain
later that the judge was biased”
Vakauta v Kelly
[1989] HCA 44
(1989) 167 CLR 568
Procedural fairness
fairness, was also referred to by the appellant, and is a concept articulated as
Chong & Kerimowa
FedCFamC1A 158
... the doctrine of procedural fairness is concerned with ensuring fairness to
all parties, not just to one of them. The father and
the ICL were also entitled
to procedural fairness. Moreover, the doctrine is concerned only with the
fairness of the process, not
the fairness of the outcome (

... Although insusceptible of a formulation which comprises closed categories,
abuse of process is capable of application in any
circumstances in which the use
of a court’s procedures would be unjustifiably oppressive to a party or
would bring the administration

be available to relieve against injustice to a party or impairment to the system
of administration of justice which might otherwise be occasioned in

power being exercised and the statutory context

if procedural unfairness can be identified, that will not automatically result
in the appeal being allowed. If the primary judge’s
decision was
inevitable despite the procedural irregularity, a new trial will not be ordered

encompasses Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 5, but it is hard to see the connection between
these grounds and the two appellable orders made
by the primary judge.
3 is baseless – contrary to the appellant’s contention, the primary
judge did not award costs in the ICL’s
favour but reserved that issue for
determination at the conclusion of trial. We further observe there is no
of the Act to which reference is made. The appellant accepted this ground must
fail. We agree.
1(a) complains about the Application in a Proceeding being summarily dismissed.
This prospect had been highlighted by the
primary judge by an order of 31 March
20 May 2025 the parties must be prepared to address the Court as to whether or
not the [appellant’s] Application in a Proceeding
filed on 17 March 2025
should be summarily dismissed as an abuse of process or some other
the reasons reveal at [35], no one made submissions about following such an
approach. It is hard therefore for the appellant to
maintain a ground about
summary dismissal when that did not occur.
primary judge ordered on 24 February 2025 (as amended on 15 May 2025):
[appellant] is to only include in her Amended Application in a Proceeding,
Orders that can be reasonably dealt with at an interim
stage noting that there
is no right to cross examination of witnesses at an interim hearing and noting
that Rule 5.09(1) limits the
times of a hearing to two (2) hours.
put the appellant on notice of the limits of an interlocutory hearing.
4 of the 31 March 2025 orders put the appellant on notice that the primary judge
was concerned about the state of her application.
She did not amend it.
the interim hearing on 20 May 2025 the primary judge heard from the appellant
both via an interpreter and in English by her choice,
had two long affidavits
from her of almost 400 pages in total, and two sets of written submissions. The
primary judge also referred
to the appellant’s Notice of Risk, which she
described in
of her Notice of Appeal as a “new, updated 100-page
Notice of Risk”.
hearing went for three hours and three minutes, including a stand down of nine
for removing the ICL, the appellant, respectfully, misunderstood the role of an
ICL. This is an apt summary of her complaints
[APPELLANT]: It is her duty to investigate when a party raises allegations of
fraud within the court and the Family Court. It is
her job to investigate and
not dismiss.
(Transcript 20 May 2025, p.14 lines 20–21)
is not the ICL’s job to investigate alleged fraud.
Ultimately,
the primary judge determined the application to remove the ICL was not an abuse
of process, but an application which the
appellant was entitled to bring. The
primary judge considered the merits of that aspect of the appellant’s
application and
was not persuaded by any of her arguments. We see no error in
the primary judge’s approach to this topic, alongside the problem
is hard to logically and transparently connect this ground with the two orders
subject of appeal.
primary judge did the best he could with respect to the balance of the
appellant’s proposed orders, identifying many as
matters for trial, and
noting their confusing nature. Having regard to the orders sought, the primary
judge’s description
of them at [34] (excluding the application about the
ICL which he considered separately) as “bordering on incoherency”
entirely apt. We also agree the order for DNA testing about a non-subject child
was “an extraordinary order to seek”
at [37]. The primary judge
engaged with the contradictory nature of the appellant’s interim parenting
1(b) is a complaint about how the primary judge determined to hear the matter.
That is a matter of case management, it is
not decisive of legal rights, and
sheds no light on how the two orders subject of appeal were in error.
1(c) and 2 concern the primary judge receiving apparently late material from the
ICL, being the ICL’s Response and affidavit
concerning the
appellant’s application to remove the ICL. The appellant also submitted
she did not have an opportunity to
grounds have very little to do with the two orders which are the subject of
ICL’s material was filed four days before the hearing in compliance with r
5.07 of the
Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules
(Cth). That rule provides that each affidavit in support of or in
opposition to an interlocutory application must be filed and served
at least two
business days before the date fixed for the hearing.
ICL’s material was not late as claimed. The appellant said she
“understood” when this was explained to her.
appellant also said she was not afforded the opportunity to respond. We do not
accept that.
it was for the appellant to convince the primary judge that the ICL ought be
removed. Second, the appellant had the opportunity
to make oral submissions on
the day of the hearing about the ICL resisting the very application the
appellant agitated. Third, there
is no such process as a Response to a
Response. Fourth, the appellant raised no difficulties with the primary judge
at the time,
was asked several times if she had anything else to say, and, did
not seek an adjournment.
1(d) and 2 claim the primary judge failed to consider the appellant’s
Response to the father’s Application in
a Proceeding. That Response is an
even more confusing document than her Application in a Proceeding. It sought
orders such as:
sections 75
Family Law Act 1975
Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law)
, the [appellant] respectfully seeks the following
Pursuant to
section 79A
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) and the
Court’s inherent powers to prevent an abuse of process, ... That the
entire proceedings be stayed immediately,
pending the outcome of the following
matters: ...
(As per the original)
provisions are all property or de facto property provisions.
are parenting proceedings.
is little wonder the primary judge did not engage with the appellant’s
Response, and accordingly these grounds fail.
5 complains about the primary judge not granting the part of the
appellant’s Application in a Proceeding to remove the
ICL. This ground is
caged in terms of the primary judge’s “Misapplication of Abuse of
Process doctrine”. The
primary judge did not “silence legitimate
applications” as the appellant contends but heard it and was against the
for the reasons set out.
is also clear from the transcript and the appellant’s voluminous material
before the primary judge, that she misunderstood
the role of the ICL. However,
that has nothing to do with the primary judge’s decision making, much less
the two orders subject
of this appeal.
any event, this ground can only logically focus on Order 2 of the 20 May 2025
orders. It is procedural in nature and not amenable
ground must fail.
Best interests grounds
7 and 10 posit that the primary judge disregarded evidence of the father’s
family violence and evidence of risk. Both
import the truism of a child’s
best interests being paramount. The primary judge was well alert to the
appellant’s allegations
(see reasons at [43] for an example), which the
father denied. The primary judge observed, rightly, that these disputes of
were trial issues.
terms of parenting orders, the primary judge did two things. First, to dismiss
the confusing and contradictory interim parenting
orders sought by the appellant
for the reasons given. Second, to set a new date by which the child’s
time with the father
would resume in line with an earlier best interests consent
order. Order 8 makes that clear:
[respondent’s] time with [the child], shall recommence on Friday 23 May
2025, in accordance with Order 3(c)(i) of the Orders
made by consent on 18 April
appellant’s complaints about time resuming are in the context of her also
telling the primary judge:
[APPELLANT]: I admit – and I want this to be on record – that the
child is requesting to see her father in person at
a contact centre.
HIS HONOUR: The child is saying the child wants to see the father.
[APPELLANT]: Yes. Yes. Yes. I want this to be on record.
(Transcript 20 May 2025, p.29 lines 8–13)
the time for recommencement of time has come and gone, and if it is being
complied with, then appeal grounds canvassing this order
is futile. If it is
not being complied with, then the father has other options available to
grounds are not made out.
Other grounds
6 concerns the primary judge’s apparent failure to enforce the
father’s disclosure obligations under r 15.04 of
Family Law Rules
(Cth). Apart from the obsolescence of this rule, the ground does not
assist the appellant in attacking the two orders from which
an appeal lies.
ground fails.
8 concerns a letter apparently written by the appellant’s own mother; the
appellant is of the view her mother “impersonated”
the father in
writing it and that the letter is defamatory. In
of the Notice of
Appeal, the appellant said:
The Appellant sought to introduce this evidence not only for the purposes of
rebutting the Respondent's claims, but also for referral
to appropriate
authorities in connection with ongoing or contemplated civil and criminal
proceedings, including for fraud, perjury,
and breaches of domestic violence
ground complains that the primary judge failed to refer the father and/or the
appellant’s mother to “police or prosecutorial
authorities”;
the link between this ground and the two orders amenable to appeal is not clear.
Further, there is no s 13 in
ground fails.
9 complains that the primary judge made procedural orders for obtaining
psychiatric assessments of both parties as sought by
the ICL - the appellant had
sought only the father be assessed but not herself.
of the sub-grounds to Ground 9 have nothing to do with the exercise of judicial
power and do not constitute a judgment from which
an appeal lies, including that
the ICL had made bookings for assessments, or the timing of the report’s
release, or the cultural
competencies of the psychiatrist.
