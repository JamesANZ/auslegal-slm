Introduction
James Maher, you have been convicted of 28 counts of theft after a trial by
judge alone. You were originally charged with
208 offences. During the trial,
after it became apparent that the prosecution would be unable to prove the
remaining charges on
the indictment, the prosecution entered nolle
prosequis in respect of five charges and effectively conceded that verdicts
guilty should be entered with respect to the balance of the charges on
the indictment.
Accordingly,
you are now to be sentenced on the basis of 28 separate transactions that
occurred over roughly a two-month period between
29 January 2018 and 22
March 2018. The facts surrounding these offences were extensively canvassed
during the trial and I have set
out the relevant facts in my judgment,
[2025] ACTSC 339
, delivered on 1 August 2025.
do not intend to repeat those facts today except to remark that at the time of
committing each of these offences, you were entrusted
by the victim, to manage
his financial affairs after he was rendered a quadriplegic as a consequence
of an accident in September
2017. The victim, who was, at the relevant time, an
inpatient at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, placed a significant amount
of trust in you. Your breach of his trust was both egregious and a significant
aggravating feature of your offending.
victim cannot move his body from the shoulders to the toes and cannot use his
hands to write or type and he is, therefore, almost
wholly reliant on others to
carry out most daily tasks. You were his best friend. Your betrayal of him has
had a devastating impact
on him emotionally and mentally. Most of the money
stolen by you was used on gambling, alcohol and marijuana. The total amount
stolen was $6,400.
all of the circumstances into account, I accept the prosecution's submission
that your offending should be characterised as
in the middle of the range
of objective seriousness for this type of offending. You have demonstrated very
little remorse or insight
as to the effect of your offending on your friend.
That much is clear from the comments made in the presentence report and the
correction order assessment report tendered upon sentencing.
is also obvious that you have had a significant alcohol and drug problem for a
number of years. For this reason, the Correctional
Services Department do not
regard you as a suitable candidate for an intensive correction order.
In that report, the reporting officer
observed that you lacked candour
It seems that you're
still in denial, Mr Maher.
now to your personal circumstances. You are now 57 years old. You do not come
to court as a first offender. Your criminal
history includes mostly
drug-related offences, failing to produce information when requested, and
contravention of other orders.
Nevertheless, you have always complied
satisfactorily with previous court orders that have been made.
the present time, you are in stable accommodation and employment and I note
that you have significant family support. That much
is evident from the
statement of your sister, Kylie Lissom. Her statement to the Court has shed the
most light on how this whole
sorry state of affairs has come about. Your
referees and employer speak well of you. In particular, your current employer
you are a highly valued member of the team.
sentencing you, I take into account that for offending of this nature, namely
fraud involving a breach of trust, the sentence the
Court imposes must emphasise
the need for general deterrence as well as holding you, the offender,
accountable for your actions and
recognising the emotional and mental harm which
has undoubtedly been caused to the victim.
the reasons canvassed by both the prosecutor and in the presentence reports, I
agree that it is not appropriate in your case to
make an intensive correction
order. I do consider that the necessary sentencing objectives can best be met
by the imposition of
a custodial sentence. However, there is, in my view, a
proper basis, given all of the circumstances, including your current personal
circumstances, and including the fact that you are unlikely to reoffend in this
way, to wholly suspend the sentence of imprisonment
to be imposed.
are in a position to make reparation for the stolen amount of $6,400 and
I will therefore include that as a condition of the good
behaviour order
which I intend to impose. I am also satisfied that it is appropriate to order
that you complete 60 hours of community
service. Both of those conditions are
to be fulfilled within two years from the date of the sentence.
let me tell you why. Although the departmental presentence reporter said
community service is not an option for you, or not
suitable because of your
ongoing drug and alcohol addition, I do note that in the past you have
satisfactorily complied with a community
service order. It is also a fact,
if I accept your employer's reference, that you are a good worker and
capable of doing work.
It is, in my view, appropriate therefore that you make
some sort of reparation to the community as a whole for your offending. It
cannot make much difference to the victim, but I do believe it will more
adequately reflect the consequences of your offending and
ensure as well that
you are gainfully employed on the weekends when you are required to do community
service instead of gambling
and drinking, as is your habit.
I was empowered to impose one overall sentence in respect of all 28 charges
for which you have been convicted, I would have imposed
a sentence of 12
months. However, because I am required to impose individual sentences, I have
structured the sentence as follows.
these reasons, I make the following orders.
(1) For each of the offences on counts 1 to 7 (SCCAN2025/8, SCCAN2025/9,
SCCAN2025/10, SCCAN2025/11, SCCAN2025/12, SCCAN2025/13,
SCCAN2025/14) on the
indictment, you are convicted and you are sentenced to 3 months imprisonment
commencing on 31 October 2025 and
ending on 30 January 2026. Each sentence is to
be wholly concurrent with each other.
(2) For each of the offences on counts 8 to 14 (SCCAN2025/15, SCCAN2025/16,
SCCAN2025/17, SCCAN2025/18, SCCAN2025/19, SCCAN2025/20,
SCCAN2025/21) you are
convicted and you are sentenced to 3 months imprisonment commencing on 31
January 2026 and ending on 30 April
2026. Each sentence is to be wholly
concurrent with each other.
(3) For each of the offences on counts 15 to 21 (SCCAN2025/22, SCCAN2025/23,
SCCAN2025/24, SCCAN2025/25, SCCAN2025/26, SCCAN2025/27,
SCCAN2025/28) you are
convicted and you are sentenced to 3 months imprisonment commencing on 1 May
2026 and ending on 31 July 2026.
Each sentence is to be wholly concurrent with
each other.
(4) For each of the offences on counts 22 to 28 (SCCAN2025/29, SCCAN2025/30,
SCCAN2025/31, SCCAN2025/32, SCCAN2025/33, SCCAN2025/34,
SCCAN2025/35) you are
convicted and you are sentenced to 2 months and 30 days imprisonment commencing
on 1 August 2026 and ending
on 30 October 2026. Each sentence is to be wholly
concurrent with each other.
(5) Each group of seven offences are to be made cumulative.
(6) That means that a total period of imprisonment of 12 months is imposed. The
overall sentence is to be wholly suspended immediately,
upon you agreeing to
agree to enter into a Good Behaviour Order for a period of two years, with the
following conditions:
(a) That within two years from today you repay the sum of $6,400 to the victim
in 24 monthly repayments.
(b) That you perform 60 hours of community service within a period of two years
from today;
(c) That you supply samples of blood, breath, hair, saliva or urine for alcohol
or drug testing if required to do so by a corrections
officer; and
(d) That you regularly attend alcohol or drug management programs which might be
suggested or ordered by a corrections officer.
