Davis, Ruth --- "Case Note: Federal Court declares Japanese whaling illegal in Australian Antarctic Waters: Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2008] FCA 3" [2008] MarStudies 11; (2008) 159 Maritime Studies 21
Federal Court declares Japanese whaling illegal in Australian Antarctic Waters:
Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd
[2008] FCA 3
Court declares Japanese whaling illegal in Australian Antarctic
Humane Society International Inc v
Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd
[2008] FCA 3
On 15 January 2008, the Federal Court declared that Japanese whaling in
Australian Antarctic waters was contrary to the
Environment Protection and
Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
(Cth) (‘EPBC Act’) and issued
an injunction restraining further breaches of the
That ruling, by Allsop J,
represents the culmination of over three years of litigation by the Humane
Society International Inc (‘HSI’).
HSI commenced proceedings in the Federal Court in October 2004, seeking the
enforcement of certain provisions of the EPBC Act that
make it an offence to
kill or interfere with whales within the Australian exclusive economic zone
(EEZ). In order to proceed with
the litigation, HSI had to seek the
Court’s permission to serve the originating process on the respondent, the
Japanese company
Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha (‘Kyodo’), in Japan. Before
deciding whether or not he would grant the necessary leave, Allsop J

the Attorney-General submitted that the matter

diplomatic channels rather than the

majority decided that it was also premature to refuse leave to serve outside the
of any possible orders for
final relief.
As might be anticipated, actually serving the process documents on the
respondent in Japan proved to be difficult. Justice Allsop
notes how the
Japanese Government, through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, refused to provide
any assistance:

allow the documents to be accepted for service on the grounds that ‘this

the applicant twice
sent the necessary documents to the respondent’s business by registered
post. Each time the envelope was
returned, unopened, with a stamp indicating
that the respondent refused to receive it. On a further occasion, a lawyer
attended the
respondent’s offices in person and finally managed to leave
the package of service documents with the respondent’s employees.
Not surprisingly, Kyodo did not respond to the service documents and did not
appear on the date of the scheduled hearing. The matter
proceeded, with the
applicant producing evidence to establish the claim rather than seeking a
default judgment.
Evidence of whaling activities came largely from reports submitted by the
respondent to the International Whaling
Commission.
The applicant was
able to use the data in the reports to demonstrate that whales had been killed
or otherwise interfered with inside
Australia’s Antarctic EEZ. Justice
Allsop had no trouble in finding that

Allsop then considered the Court’s discretion to refuse relief, and once
more raised international law issues and futility
as possible grounds for
exercising that discretion. The Attorney-General had again been invited to make
submissions in the case,
and had confirmed his previous position. However,
Allsop J, in line with the Full Court’s ruling, stated that uncertainty
Australian sovereignty in Antarctica and jurisdiction in the
Australian Antarctic EEZ could not be examined by the Federal Court
proceedings.
He commented
[t]hese matters of sovereignty and international recognition (and lack of
extensiveness thereof) can be taken to have been before,
and well recognised by,
Parliament when it enacted the EPBC
Further, in
light of the public interest nature of the proceedings, and the fact that any
difficulty in enforcing the Court’s
order would be a result of the
respondent’s disobedience, Allsop J refused to withhold relief on the
grounds of futility.
Whether or not HSI gets the opportunity to have the court’s orders
enforced remains to be seen. The recent change in Federal
Government has
certainly affected the context surrounding the case. Prior to the final judgment
being handed down, the new Minister
for Foreign Affairs, Steven Smith MP, and
the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett MP,

legislation and would be separate from the Humane Society
