EPA v ENGELS
[2025] SAERDC 16
THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING JUDGMENT:
The defendant Joel Peter Engels has pleaded
guilty to two counts of intentionally or recklessly contravening an environment
policy contrary to
Environment Protection
(SA), (the Act) and cl10(1) of the Environment Protection (Waste to
Resources) Policy 2010.
That is summary offending and the maximum penalty applicable in each case is
a fine of $120,000 or imprisonment for two years.
The defendant, due to the timing of his plea of guilty, is entitled to a
legislative discount of up to 40% of any penalty imposed.
The factual basis for sentencing has been agreed in the Combined Summary of
Allegations and Antecedent Report,

that he would be bringing waste materials to the

Section 5D(5)
17 March 2025, Dion Buring (an authorised officer under the
Environment
Protection Act 1993
) provided a notice to Joel Peter Engels. That notice was
given pursuant to
section 5D(5)
Environment Protection Act
that notice, Engels was invited to provide a statutory declaration in the event
that he was not the principal offender or the owner
of the Truck at the time of
the First or Second Disposal. He was given until 7 April 2025 to do so. No
statutory declaration was
The defendant explained his reasons for this
offending. He said he had been engaged to do some work at the site of the
dumping; the
removal of all the trees on the site. He said after commencing that
work an officer of the council told him one of the trees was
a significant tree
and not to be removed. He said that upset the person who had contracted him to
remove the tree and a dispute arose
defendant said he was so angry he dumped unrelated waste on the site, in order
to convince
his client to pay what was owed.
I accept the defendant regrets that act and recognises that was not the right
way to go about recovering what he was owed. I also
accept he was unaware the
waste contained asbestos and it had subsequently cost him $8000 to remove that
waste and dispose of it
As for the personal circumstances of the defendant, he was experiencing
significant stress at the time of this offending relating
to a contested family
inheritance and a workplace incident suffered by a person he had engaged.
The defendant is in a relationship but has no children. The defendant has
several criminal convictions which indicate an unwillingness
to comply with the
usual regulation which applies to us all.
The defendant operates a tree lopping business. He owns three trucks, a ute
and a car. His current annual revenue just exceeds $100,000.
He owns a block of
land which is intended to be developed for his own home. He is on a payment plan
for several fines for driving
offences. He has a tax debt of $46,000.
This is unusual offending. It was done deliberately as a misguided attempt to
get the attention of a person the defendant says owed
him money. The defendant
did take prompt steps to clean up that mess.
Having spoken directly with the defendant, as he represented himself, I do
consider this prosecution has already had a deterrent effect
on him. I accept
the defendant is contrite and I am guardedly optimistic as to his prospects of
rehabilitation and I consider he
is unlikely to offend again.
A conviction in respect of each offence will be recorded.
In respect of each offence, I adopt a starting point of $12,000. Each
starting point will be reduced by 40% to $7,200.
The two offences were interconnected to the extent they related to one
transaction with a former client of the defendant. I will therefore
