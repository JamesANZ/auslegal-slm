[2010] SAWC 1
Judgment of Senior Warden Dr

ENERGY AND RESOURCES - MINERALS -
MINING FOR MINERALS
Owner of land, notice of entry, preliminary point
MAXIMUS RESOURCES LTD v
JON BENNETT ALTON, ARTHUR JAMES FOWLER & RICHARD GORDON TEUSNER
[2010] SAWC 1
is a further application filed on 21 December 2009 by Maximus Resources Ltd
(Maximus) for permission to undertake a drilling
program over land that is
exempt from mining due to the proximity of dams, springs and residences.
circumstances of exemption are the same as set out in my judgment between the
same parties on 4 July 2008. In addition, there
was an objection to entry and
the use of declared equipment by the owner of the land where the drilling
program is proposed, Mr Richard
Gordon Teusner. His land has been leased for
two years from 1 January 2009 to J.S. and M.A. Teusner (Exhibit R1, annexure 3)
$75/ha per annum. Other than the additional interest of J.S. and M.A.
Teusner, and the timing of the program, the proposal is broadly
the same as that
on which I ruled in that earlier judgment. Those differences led me to require
a fresh application but I have accepted
the evidence from the earlier case and I
expect my judgment here to be consistent with my earlier judgment.
matter was listed for directions on 2 February 2010 and set for trial on 3 March
2010. There was an adjustment to 4 March 2010
and then an adjournment of the
trial date. The trial continued and was heard on 16 March 2010.
writing my judgment I have noted that the application is framed as a removal of
exemptions to mining. As a preliminary point
I raise the owners’ rights
to object to entry
Mining Act 1971
compensation
61—Compensation
(1) The owner of any land upon which mining operations are carried out in
pursuance of this Act shall be entitled to receive compensation
for any economic
loss, hardship and inconvenience suffered by him in consequence of mining
operations.
(2) In determining the compensation payable under this section, the following
matters shall be considered:
(a) any damage caused to the land by the person carrying out the mining
operations; and
(b) any loss of productivity or profits as a result of the mining operations;
(c) any other relevant matters.
(3) The amount of the compensation shall be an amount determined by agreement
between the owner and the mining operator or, in default
of agreement, an amount
determined, upon application by an interested party, by the appropriate
(4) The appropriate court, in determining compensation under this section, shall
take into consideration any work that the mining
operator has carried out, or
undertakes to carry out, to rehabilitate the land.
(5) Upon the hearing of an application for compensation under this section, the
appropriate court may order a mining operator to
carry out such work to
rehabilitate the land as the Court thinks fit.
is broadly defined as
of land means—
(a) a person who holds a registered estate or interest in the land conferring a
right to immediate possession of the land; or
(b) a person who holds native title in the land; or
(c) a person who has, by statute, the care, control or management of the land;
(d) a person who is lawfully in occupation of the

in terms of the definition. They should be parties
and notice of entry
and notice of the intention to use declared equipment
should be given to
them. Absent that, mining cannot proceed. This may have occurred and they may
have then objected. It may be
that the earlier notice to Mr R.G. Teusner is
sufficient. In any event, the rights being pursued here are well known to the
I canvassed them in my earlier judgment of 4 July 2008 (at para.38):
Mr Teusner’s position is different. His rights come as an
objection to entry and to drilling.
quoted the relevant sections.
John Teusner gave evidence and pursued arguments for compensation. I have heard
fresh evidence and submissions and, for the reasons
I gave at paras.36-41 of my
July 2008 judgment, I remain of the view that I should let the proposed
exploration proceed on conditions
to minimise the effect of the mining operation
and compensation for those effects that cannot be removed. I am still
considering
the appropriate conditions and terms of compensation to be imposed.
However, if I am correct that J.S. and M.A. Teusner, who are
occupation of the land, are not parties, then no order I make will bind them.
If they have not received the notices, or
have effectively received notices and
raised objections, then mining cannot proceed. I invite Maximus Resources Ltd
to consider
this position whilst I continue to consider the matter. I give
liberty to apply.
