Family tax benefit and baby bonus: meaning of 'living with' for resident
of Australia and child born overseas
SECRETARY to the DSS and McGEE
Decided: 4th February 2014 by R.P. Handley
McGee aged 59, an Australian citizen and resident, had a small mechanical
repair business and worked casual hours as a security guard.
He met a lady in
Cambodia in 2008, he kept in contact, and by 2011 the couple decided to marry.
It is against the law in Cambodia
for a foreign man over 50 to marry a Cambodian
woman. So they became engaged in Cambodia in July 2011 and flew to Australia the
day. Mrs McGee became pregnant in Australia but had to return to Cambodia
when her 3 month visa expired. McGee flew to Cambodia in
January 2012 to arrange
accommodation for Mrs McGee and the expected baby. McGee also applied for a
prospective spouse visa at this
time. McGee returned to Australia for employment
reasons and when the chosen apartment in Cambodia became vacant Mrs McGee signed
McGee’s daughter was born in early April and McGee flew to Cambodia on
18 April 2012. McGee applied for Australian citizenship
for his daughter on 26
April 2012 and he returned to Australia the next day. McGee paid for his niece
to visit Mrs McGee and his
daughter in July 2012 and his niece helped Mrs McGee
with her visa application. In October 2012 McGee was able to travel to Cambodia
and bring Mrs McGee and his daughter to Australia. They were married in February
2013. Mrs McGee was granted a subclass 300 visa
on 24 May 2013.
McGee said he was advised by Centrelink that the ‘Baby Bonus claim must
be lodged within 52 weeks of the child’s birth’.
McGee lodged a
claim for Baby Bonus and family tax benefit (FTB) on 28 November 2012.
Centrelink rejected the Baby Bonus claim because
McGee’s daughter was not
his FTB child within 26 weeks of her birth. McGee was granted FTB from the date
his child arrived
in Australia.
The AAT needed to decide whether McGee was eligible to receive the Baby Bonus
in respect of his daughter and whether he was eligible
to receive FTB for the
period prior to his daughter’s arrival in Australia on 19 October 2012.
Legislation
Eligibility for the Baby Bonus and FTB is governed by the
A New Tax System
(Family Assistance) Act 1999
(Cth) (the Family Assistance Act). Eligibility for
the Baby Bonus is linked to an individual’s eligibility for the FTB. At
the relevant time, s.36(2)(aa) required that the child be ‘an FTB child of
the individual’ to be eligible for Baby Bonus,
and s.36(2)(b)(i) required
that the individual was ‘eligible for family tax benefit in respect of the
FTB child at any time
within the period of 26 weeks starting on the day of the
child’s birth’.
Eligibility for FTB is determined by s.21 of the Family Assistance Act.
Section 21(1)(b)(i) states that to be eligible for FTB the
individual must be
‘an Australian resident’. McGee qualified as a resident but to be
eligible for the Baby Bonus and
FTB in respect of his daughter she was required
to be an ‘FTB child’. An ‘FTB child’ is defined as:
22 (1) An individual is an FTB child of another individual (the adult) in any
of the cases set out in this section.
Individual aged under 16
(2) An individual is an FTB child of the adult if:
(a) the individual is aged under 16; and
(b) the individual is in the adult’s care; and
(c) the individual is an Australian resident, is a special category visa
holder residing in Australia or is living with the adult;
(d) the circumstances surrounding legal responsibility for the care of the
individual are those mentioned in paragraph (5)(a), (b)
The AAT referred to the FA Guide for guidance as to the ‘living
with’ requirement at 2.1.2.10 and at 2.1.2.30.
2.1.2.10. ...
General residence requirements
In deciding whether a child is ‘living with’ the individual for
the purposes of the residence requirements, the ordinary
‘living’ should be used, that is, residing, dwelling or occupying a
place as a domicile. The period of time
that the child has been staying with the
individual may also be considered. A short period of staying with the child or
the child while the child is still residing overseas is not likely to
constitute living with the individual.
2.1.2.30. ...
Child born overseas
A person can claim FTB and/or baby bonus for a child who is born overseas
while they are outside Australia, subject to other eligibility
criteria. The
claim must however be lodged within the allowable claim period. The residence
requirements for FTB and baby bonus are
satisfied as long as at least one parent
is an Australian resident who is temporarily absent from Australia.
If a person returns to Australia without the child, they may still be
eligible for a payment if the child was living with them at
any time after the
birth. They may als be entitled to FTB and/or baby bonus if the child is an
Australian resident or SCV holder
residing in Australia as long as the child is
still in their care.
Example 1: Sarah and Kate are a couple who leave Australia temporarily for 18
months. Four months after departure, Sarah has a baby
and lodges a claim for FTB
and baby bonus after the birth. As Sarah and the baby are only temporarily
absent from Australia, they
may be eligible for FTB and baby bonus. Note: Sarah
need not wait until her return to Australia to lodge the claim as the baby bonus
claim must be lodged within 52 weeks of the child’s birth.
Example 2: Jeffrey leaves Australia temporarily to travel overseas. While
overseas he meets and marries a non- Australian resident
who subsequently has
his child. As the birth parent is not residentially qualified for payment,
Jeffrey may lodge a claim for FTB
and baby bonus within the applicable time
Submissions
The Department argued that McGee did not satisfy the requirement in s.22(2)
(c). McGee contended that his daughter was living with
him during the relevant
period. The Department contended that a 10 day visit to Cambodia after the child
was born did not constitute
living (synonymous with dwell or reside) with the
child within the first 26 weeks after birth. The Department argued that McGee
not intended to treat the apartment in Cambodia as his home and referred the
Tribunal to the decision in Sheehan and Secretary, Department
of Families,
Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs
[2011] AATA 611 (Sheehan)
case with similar facts.
McGee argued that Sheehan was different in that Sheehan had not intended to
marry the mother of his child and make a family. McGee
had always intended to
marry but the Cambodian law and the migration process had been a barrier. It was
argued that even a short
period of time with the child overseas could qualify as
‘living with’. McGee gave evidence that he had paid for all of
expenses for his daughter and the Baby Bonus was to assist with the expenses
associated with a baby’s birth.
McGee stated that he was confused about the rules of 26 weeks and 52 weeks.
Although his daughter had remained in Cambodia to complete
her immunisation
program, McGee stated that he might have been able to bring the program forward
if Centrelink had said the time
limit was 26 weeks.
The AAT found that this decision turned on the meaning of the term
‘living with’ in s.22(2)(c) of the Family Assistance
Act. McGee was
required to be ‘living with’ his daughter during the relevant period
of 26 weeks. The term is not defined
in the legislation, unlike the word
‘resides’, which is explained in
section 7(3)
Social Security
. To interpret undefined words it is usual to look at ‘the
ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words of the provision having
their context and legislative purpose’; Australian Education Union v
Department of Education and Children’s
[2012] HCA 3
The AAT found that the words ‘abide’ and ‘dwell’ had
a temporal element suggesting a degree of permanence
which was reflected in the
‘Guide’ stating a short period of time is not likely to constitute
living with the individual;
although a short time was not precluded. In Sheehan,
the AAT found the 33 days spent by Sheehan with his child and the child’s
mother in the Philippines was a temporary arrangement, and Sheehan had no
entitlement to Baby Bonus. In this case, the AAT found
the facts were different
but the dwelling arrangement was similar. The AAT found that McGee’s
daughter was not an FTB child
even though they had 9 or 10 days together in
April 2012.
The AAT noted the confusion about the 52 weeks and suggested that he could
make a claim under the Compensation for Detriment Caused
by Defective
Administration Scheme.
Formal decision
The AAT set aside the decision of the SSAT and decided that McGee was not
eligible for the Baby Bonus in respect of his daughter,
nor was he eligible for
the FTB prior to 19 October 2012.
