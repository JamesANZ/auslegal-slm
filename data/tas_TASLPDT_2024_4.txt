The Tribunal ordered that the names of the parties to the application be

Reasons for Decision
1. This decision concerns an application for costs by the Practitioner
(‘practitioner’). It follows the failure of the
‘Complainants’ application to the Tribunal by an appeal by re-
hearing (the reasons for which are referred to as the
against the
determination of the
Legal Profession Board of Tasmania
‘Board’) dismissing a complaint the ‘practitioner’ had
been guilty of “
unsatisfactory professional conduct
professional
misconduct”
principal reasons’
should be read with these reasons
The Board summarily dismissed the complaint pursuant to
s.433(1)(a)
Legal Profession Act
( the “LPA”) as
”lacking in substance”.
.As stated in the
the complaint before
the ‘Board’ was-
“In or around August 2012 ,the Practitioner failed to address the
Complainants grievances and concerns in relation to the
manner in which their
legal matter was effected by the practitioner’s legal firm and further
failed to conduct a proper review
and or assessment of the actions of the legal
practitioner who had carriage of the matter.”
. The ‘practitioner’ was the principal of the firm
engaged by the ‘Complainants’. Another, ‘KBC’
lawyer conducting the ‘Complainants’ litigation since August 2009.
The ‘practitioner’ had never met
the ‘Complainants’ or
had undertaken any work for them. Their matter was close to trial in August 2012
, and they became
dissatisfied with advice given and courses of action and the
quantum of damages likely recoverable as suggested by counsel. There
also was an
application for production of their documents claimed as privileged shortly to
be heard in Court in Melbourne. The ‘Complainants’
wrote to the
practitioner for urgent help.
. The ‘practitioners’ retainer was “ ...
matter of urgency, if you would look into the status of our matter ,review
recent correspondence and assess our situation.
. The practitioner responded immediately
“ ...I shall review
the status of your case in the context of your concerns and I expect to be able
to advise you of the outcome
by Monday 6
. It is unnecessary to further detail the facts and our reasoning
which are set out in the
principal reasons
except that-
(i) the practitioner responded fully to the ‘Complainants’ by
of August 2012 in the context asked.
(ii)because of the ‘practitioners’ response or due to a large
part of it, the litigation of the ‘Complainants’
settled shortly
afterwards without need to argue the production of documents or proceed to
. By late August and further in September 2012 the
‘Complainants’ commenced agitating to the practitioner about issues
that were not specific to his retainer. However, he dealt with an issue of his
law practice being authorised by its agreement with
‘Complainants’ to enable costs to be taken from settlement monies of
theirs held in trust.
. The ‘Complainants’ complained to the
‘Board’ of issues they say the ‘practitioner’ did not
in his response of the 6
of August 2012. The issues raised
were not part of the request to the ‘practitioner’ or his agreement
forming his retainer.
They were raised again in the re-hearing before the
Tribunal and again are the subject of the ‘Complainants’ submissions
as to costs, in effect that their complaint was not dealt with by the
‘Board’ or Tribunal it being , with various variations
wording, that “
the practitioner had condoned the misconduct of
.The Tribunal is of the opinion as was the ‘Board’, that
the complaint had no prospect of success ;it was unarguable and
was lacking in
It was dismissed.
.The Tribunal has jurisdiction to require the
‘Complainants’ pay the ‘practitioners’ legal costs as
of the ‘ LPA’ . The practitioner seeks
costs on an indemnity basis. We have held that the Tribunal, once jurisdiction
is established to make a costs order, it has power to make a special costs
order, such as solicitor client costs or indemnity costs
against a party before
the Tribunal from the wording of
of the ‘LPA’. The
discretion must be exercised judicially and cautiously. It is accepted that
usually if costs are to
be made by order of the Tribunal, they would be based on
party party costs.
. In exercise of our discretion whether to order costs be paid and
the basis for them we take account of the following factors as
respect of the ‘Complainants’ in the related matter of complaint
against ][‘KBC’]-
(i) Costs orders including special costs orders are not punitive.
(ii) Although the Complainants were unrepresented in the Tribunal, they
consulted lawyers as to procedural matters.
(iii) The ‘Complainants’ were informed at the first directions
hearing at the Tribunal they could be liable for costs
‘practitioner’ and warned they could be considerable if counsel
was involved
(iv)Although unrepresented their complaint material and submissions revealed
they are articulate and not lacking education. They
were prepared to use those
gifts in submissions to misstate what the’ practitioner’ had
stated in his report of the
of August 2012 to them; to suit
their view the ‘practitioner’ had condoned alleged misconduct of
or he had approved all [KBC’s] actions and
(v) Being unrepresented was the ‘Complainants’ choice unfettered
by financial disability or availability of legal representation.
(vi) Being unrepresented enabled them to disregard ethical considerations in
making or to exhibit restraint from making, serious
allegations of fraud and
corruption without a basis against the ‘practitioner‘
where if represented by a lawyer
they could not have been made.
(vii)The ‘Complainants’ being unsuccessful.
(viii)The practitioner incurred expenses of representation of solicitors and
counsel to defend the application that should not have
been brought by the
‘Complainants’ to the Tribunal.
As we determined in the
principal reasons
“There is no material or information provided to the Tribunal of
anything the practitioner was involved in ,aided ,counselled
or participated in
or in any way acted or omitted to act either with [‘KBC’] or
counsel or performed himself that was
or could be subject of disciplinary
action being taken against him as a legal practitioner or law practice
concerning the Complainants.”
. We are satisfied that the ‘Complainants’ be required
to pay the ‘practitioners’ legal costs and the amount
of the costs
to be paid be determined on an indemnity basis.
It is ordered that-
(1) Pursuant to s.481(4) of the Legal Profession Act 2007 (the Act) the
Complainants are required to pay the costs of the ‘practitioner’
and incidental to the re-hearing application to the Tribunal.
(2) That pursuant to s.481(5) the amount of the costs required to be paid
is to be determined on an indemnity basis; and
(3) The costs be taxed in accordance with the
Supreme Court Rules 2000
