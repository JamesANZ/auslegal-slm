APPLICATION FOR A HOTEL LICENCE
Section 51(1)
This is an application by Bend Hotel Pty Ltd for a
in respect of premises to be situated at
109-117 ROWLEY STREET ALDINGA
and to be known as
ALDINGA TAVERN
I am satisfied that the advertising requirements of
have been complied with.
Section 53(2)
Liquor Licensing Act
provides that
“a licensing
authority should not grant an application as a matter of course without proper
inquiry into its merits (whether
or not there are objections to the
application).”
For the purpose of this application, the key sections are 56, 57 and 58. I
will deal with
Section 58(1)
provides that
“an applicant for a hotel licence must
satisfy the licensing authority by such evidence as it may require that having
to the licensed premises already existing in the locality in which the
premises or proposed premises to which the application relates
are or are to be
situated, the licence is necessary in order to provide for the needs of the
public in that locality.”
Mr Battiston for the applicant, submits that the locality comprises Aldinga
Beach, Aldinga, Maslons Beach, Sellicks Beach and Port
I accept this locality with the proviso that Sellicks Beach and Port Willunga

be made out for a new
hotel in the area, but in my opinion, that time has not yet
There has been no change in the number of hotels in the locality since this
Since 1996 there has been a significant change in this locality which I have
verified on inspection. In summary:
population in 1996 was 6000 and in 2006 was 12,801
in the period
2001 to 2006 the population increased by 13% compared to a state average of
over the same
period, Aldinga Beach increased by 30%
during the years
2001 to 2006 dwellings increased by 20% compared to a state average increase of
5% population
since the 2001
to 2006 census there has been further significant development within the
inspection I noted two major housing developments within a stone’s throw
of the proposed site.
The proposed hotel will comprise a sports bar, function room,
dining areas and drive through bottle shop.
I am satisfied as to
section 58(1)
and accordingly I grant a Certificate
of the Act subject to the following conditions:-
1. the authorised trading hours (including extended trading) will be:
Monday to Saturday - 9 am to midnight
Sunday - 11 am
2. Sale of liquor for consumption off premises:

I am satisfied that the operation of the licence will not offend against

of the Act.
