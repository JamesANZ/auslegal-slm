reviewable decision was affirmed.
DETERMINATIONS MADE:
CERTIFICATE
The reviewable decision is about the calculation of the claimant’s
pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE) which concerns the amount
of weekly payments
of statutory benefits that are payable under Division 3.3 of the
Accidents Injuries Act 2017
(the MAI Act), and is therefore a merit review
matter under Schedule 2(1)(a) of the MAI Act.
reviewable decision dated 25 November 2024 is affirmed, namely that the
claimant’s PAWE is $159.50 (rounded).
STATEMENT OF REASONS
Raza (the claimant) was involved in a motor accident on 5 June 2024. The
claimant was riding his motorbike in the right-hand lane
when a ute on the
opposite side exited a petrol station driveway and made a left turn onto the
road. Instead of staying in the left
lane, the claimant says the ute veered into
the right lane and collided with the claimant.
claimant says he sustained a radial fracture and psychological sequalae as a
result of the motor accident.
claimant was 17 years of age at the time of the motor accident. His father, Asif
Moosa, made a claim on his behalf for statutory
with Youi (the insurer),
the third-party insurer of the vehicle that he says caused the accident.
Moosa is the appointed representative of the claimant in the merit review
proceedings at the Personal Injury Commission
(Commission).
the time of the motor accident, the claimant was working in casual employment at
a hamburger restaurant.
insurer made a decision that the amount of the claimant’s pre-accident
weekly earnings (PAWE) was
claimant says this figure is incorrect and seeks a determination from the Merit
Reviewer that his PAWE is $400 gross per week.
DECISION UNDER
insurer’s calculation of the claimant’s PAWE was based on payslips
provided in the 52-week period (5 June 2023 –
4 June 2024) immediately
before the motor accident. This comprised of 42 weekly payslips amounting to a
total of $8,293.37. The insurer
divided this figure by 52 weeks and arrived at a
figure of $159.48. After rounding, the insurer determined that the
PAWE was $159.50.
claimant submits that the insurer’s decision is incorrect because
additional factors regarding his employment circumstances
should be considered
in order to determine his PAWE benefits. These are:
claimant only began working in 2023, at 17 years of age, and was therefore not
receiving many shifts from his employer.
Particularly, the claimant reports that
he was only getting roughly one shift a week, and occasionally no shits.
However, as time
progressed, the claimant began receiving more shifts from his
employer each week. The claimant emphasises that the was working a
minimum of 20
hours a week at the time of the accident, and notes that his employer can
provide written correspondence confirming
that his weekly shifts were fixed at a
minimum of 20 hours per week.
The claimant highlights that his age and inexperience when beginning his
employment initially inhibited him from receiving many shifts.
However, due to
the progression of his employment and his consequent increased number of shifts
at the time of the accident, the
claimant believes that he is entitled to gross
weekly payments of greater than $159.50.
The claimant relies on his payslips dated 12 May 2024, 26 May 2024, and 2
June 2024, and submits that his PAWE should be calculated
at $400.00 gross
weekly, in accordance with the minimum fixed shifts of 20 hours per week that he
was receiving at the time of the
insurer’s reply submissions state that its internal review decision is
the preliminary conference on 25 March 2025, Ms Starnovsky, the claimant’s
representative, stated that she believed the insurer’s
calculations were
correct but it was the claimant’s appointed representative, Mr Moosa, that
wanted confirmation from a Merit
Reviewer that the calculations were indeed
was also agreement that the insurer’s calculations were made under the
correct provisions of the legislation, namely s
4(1) which defines
“pre-accident weekly earnings” as:
-accident weekly earnings
, in relation to an earner who is injured
as a result of a motor accident, means the weekly average of the gross earnings
by the earner as an earner during the 12 months immediately before the
day on which the motor accident occurred, unless subclause
referred Ms Starnovsky to her submissions about the employer allegedly fixing
the claimant’s shifts to a minimum of 20 hours
per week. I asked whether
this information was a document already in existence at the time of the motor
accident or whether it was
information that was subsequently sought from the
Starnovsky stated it was the latter and as she was not hopeful of obtaining the
information, the submission was no longer pressed.
Given the concessions from
the claimant, I stated that it was my preliminary view that the insurer’s
calculation of the claimant’s
PAWE was correct. Ms Starnovsky, however,
stated that the claimant wanted a determination on his application for merit
advised the parties that I would provide a determination with a brief statement
setting out my reasons for the
determination.
DETERMINATION
is no dispute that the claimant is an earner.
is no dispute regarding the insurer’s
setting out the various
weekly payment amounts the claimant received in the 52 weeks before the motor
parties are in agreement that sch 1, cl 4(1) applies in the calculation of the
claimant’s PAWE.
another sub-clause in cl 4 applies, the onus is on the claimant to show this.
There is no evidence before me to suggest any of
the other sub-clauses in cl 4
accordance with
Allianz Insurance Australia Limited v
the claimant’s
PAWE is calculated by taking his earnings over the whole of the 12-month period
immediately before the day of
the accident and dividing it by 52.
the calculation of the claimant’s PAWE is:
$8,293.37 / 52 =
$159.50 (rounded).
