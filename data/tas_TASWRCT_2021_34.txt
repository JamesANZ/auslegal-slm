REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
The Worker’s Claim
1. The worker is employed as a chef by the employer. She made
a claim for workers compensation dated 25 May 2021. In support of
she provided an initial workers compensation medical certificate dated 21 May
2. In summary, the worker claims that from 19 May 2021 she became
incapacitated for work as a result of pain in her left hand and
wrist, described
as tendonitis. In her claim form the worker states:
developed over time started with a small amount of pain in the thumb every time
I would lift pots, pans and deep fryer
baskets ect and gradually became worse
with time.”
3. A similar description is provided in the certificate. The
worker was certified as incapacitated for any work from 19 May 2021
2021. She was certified as fit for suitable duties from 12 July 2021 to 26
August 2021.
The Dispute
4. The employer disputes liability for the worker’s claim
pursuant to s81A of the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation and
Compensation
Act 1988 (the Act). The grounds for the dispute are as follows:
(a) The worker did not suffer an injury, not being a
disease, arising out of or in the course of her employment as required by
of the Act.
(b) The worker did not suffer an injury, which is a
disease, and to which her employment contributed to a substantial degree as
by s25(1)(b) and s3(2A) of the Act.
(c) The worker did not suffer an
injury or disease which is a recurrence, aggravation, acceleration, exacerbation
or deterioration
of any pre-existing injury or disease to which her employment
was the major or most significant contributing factor to that recurrence,
aggravation, acceleration, exacerbation or deterioration as required by s25(1)
and s3 of the Act.
5. The issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether the
employer has a reasonably arguable case to dispute liability to pay compensation
to the worker in relation to her claim for compensation.
The Evidence
6. The employer tendered and relied upon the following
documents that were filed with the s81A referral:
(a) Copy of notice of dispute to the worker.
(b) Workers
compensation claim form.
(c) Initial workers compensation medical certificate
dated 21 May 2021.
(d) Continuing workers compensation medical certificate
dated 12 July 2021.
(e) Medical report of Dr Carlin White dated 29 July
7. The employer primarily relied upon the report of Dr White.
Some pertinent aspects of his report are as follows:
• “The salient points [of the worker’s
history] are that there was gradual and insidious onset of symptoms without
obvious triggering event and that this process occurred over a 1-2 week time
This was in the setting of steady work demands, with no significant
change in total hours
my opinion [the worker’s] symptoms and signs are consistent with mild De
Quervain’s tenosynovitis (DQT).
This is best characterised as a
The presentation of symptoms on or about the 19/05/2021 would be
best described as an exacerbation of the underlying
was no work incident on 19/05/2021, this was the time at which [the worker]
sought medical care for a condition
which had been present for some time
• “...there
are many factors which contribute to a person developing DQT. The current
medical knowledge on this topic
suggests that it is a complex multiple risk
factor problem associated with anatomical variations, predisposing conditions,
hand activities
and psychosocial factors.
The individual risk factors leading
to [the worker] developing DQT may include:
• Hormonal changes secondary to
• Household
chores including cooking, cleaning and care for her
• Genetic/anatomical
predisposition
• History of
anxiety/depression
I recognise that [the worker’s] employment has played a role in her
development of this condition, I do not assess this
as the major or most
significant factor for her underlying condition. In support of this opinion is
the fact that she has worked
as a chef for at least 7 years without this issue
previously, and with no significant change in her work structure or physical
prior to symptom
am not of the opinion that [the worker’s] work is the major contributing
factor to her developing this disease.
However her work most certainly does
have the potential to cause secondary exacerbation of this condition and I am of
the opinion
that attendance with her GP, a local steroid injection (ultrasound
guided) and ongoing physical therapy would be a reasonable expense
discussed above it is not my opinion that [the worker] suffered a work related
injury, rather she is suffering from
a disease which then became apparent around
19/05/2021. The effects of this disease continue to impact her ability to work
work appears to have exacerbated this underlying disease. Her recent
failed attempt to work 4 hours per day would suggest that her
work remains a
potential exacerbating factor.”
Consideration
8. It is clear from Dr White’s report that the first and
second grounds of dispute of this claim are made out. He clearly states
the worker has not suffered a work-related injury. He says she is suffering a
disease but work was not the major contributing
factor to the development of
that disease.
9. The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from Dr
White’s report is that the worker’s incapacity arose from
aggravation or an exacerbation of her underlying disease (DQT).
10. The case
of Bradshaw v Tasmania Networks Pty Ltd
[2019] TASSC 41
, which was upheld by the
Full Court in Bradshaw v Tasmania Networks Pty Ltd
[2020] TASFC 2
is applicable
to the facts of this case.
11. The Learned Primary Judge Brett J., held at
virtue of the extended definition of injury and its interaction with section
25(1)(b), an aggravation etc of a pre-existing
injury or disease is an injury,
but only where the employment was the major or most significant contributing
factor to that aggravation.
In the case of the aggravation of a pre-existing
disease, it is the aggravation, not the underlying disease, which must be
connected to the employment in the required sense: Long v Kmart
Australia Ltd
[2016] TASSC 6
25 Tas R 237
, per Porter J. at
12. It is clear from the evidence that the worker’s
incapacity which arose on 19 May 2021 resulted from the worker’s
of symptoms on that day after having worked for the employer as a
chef lifting trays, pots and fry baskets and that those symptoms
constituted an
aggravation or exacerbation of the worker’s underlying DQT, that is the
effect of the underlying condition of
DQT on her was increased or intensified by
those symptoms
However, liability on the part of the employer to pay workers compensation for
the worker’s injury depends upon the existence
of the requisite causal
relationship between the employment and the injury.
13. In the circumstances
of this case, the question comes down to whether the evidence permits a
reasonable argument that there were
other possible causes of the worker’s
pain as she experienced it on 19 May 2021, other than her employment, which
might qualify
as the major or most significant
White consistently maintains in his report that the worker suffered incapacity
as a result of symptoms experienced on or around
19 May 2021 and that there was
a causal relationship between those symptoms and her employment generally. In
this case, the Tribunal
must consider the nature and extent of that causal
relationship
order for the employer to liable to pay compensation to this worker there must
be a causal relationship between the worker’s
employment and the
aggravation or exacerbation of the underlying disease, not the development of
the disease
requisite causal connection is that the worker’s employment must be the
major or most significant contributing factor
to the aggravation or
exacerbation. As stated by Brett J. in Bradshaw v Tasmania Networks Pty Ltd
(supra) at [58]:
“The use of the
definite article in this legislative formulation is
important.”
17. In order to fall within s25(1) employment must be
“the predominant contributing factor to the disease, or aggravation of
exacerbation of the
18. Nowhere
in Dr White’s report does he attribute the worker’s employment to be
the predominant or the major or most
significant contributing factor to the
worker’s disease (DQT) or the aggravation or exacerbation of that
19. As previously indicated Dr White says:
am not of the opinion that
[the worker’s]
work is the major
contributing factor to her developing this disease. However, her work most
certainly does have the
to cause secondary exacerbation of this
condition.”
20. Further he says:
“...it is not my
opinion that
[the worker]
suffered a work-related injury, rather she is
suffering from a disease that became apparent around 19/05/2021. The effects of
disease continue to impact her ability to work and her work
to have exacerbated this underlying disease. Her recent failed attempt to work
4 hours per day would suggest that her work remains
exacerbating
21. As a result of Dr White using words such as
“appears” and “potential” it is open to conclude that he
not attribute to the worker’s employment that it was the major or
most significant contributing factor to the aggravation or
exacerbation of her
underlying disease (DQT).
22. It is also open to conclude from Dr
White’s report that there are a number of other risk factors that may also
have played
a role in the onset of the worker’s symptoms on 19 May 2021
including being female, hormonal changes secondary to PCOS, gym
attendance,
household chores including cooking, cleaning and caring for her dog,
genetic/anatomical predisposition and history of
anxiety/depression.
White refers to a number of studies that suggest that “many more factors
than just repetitive movements are required
for the onset of symptoms of
stated by Brett J. in Bradshaw v Tasmania Networks Pty Ltd (supra) at
“On a hearing, the
resolution of this question of causation will involve a determination of fact,
on the basis of ‘a common
sense evaluation of the causal chain’:
Kooragang Cement Pty Ltd v Bates
(1994) 35 NSWLR 452
, cited by Pearce J. in Vos
Constructions v Norton-Smith. Accordingly, I am satisfied that, on the evidence
before the Tribunal,
a reasonably arguable case exists concerning the liability
[the employer]
to pay compensation. This is because
reports leave open a reasonable possibility that following a
contested hearing, the claim may be rejected, particularly having regard
requirement that the employment is the major or most significant factor in the
aggravation or exacerbation of the underlying
25. The decision of Brett J., was upheld by the Full Court. In
the reasons for decision of Estcourt J. he held at [15]-[17] as follows:
“[15] It is clear that
the relevant assessment must be carried out on the basis of the evidence
available at the time of the
referral and not on the basis of additional
evidence that might be adduced on a final hearing, which might establish another
cause as the major or most significant factor. However, that does not
mean that the contested nature of a final hearing and the inevitable
that hearing of the evidence available at the time of the referral, must be
[16] Thus, the question in the present case is, in my view, exactly as the
learned primary judge put it at [49] of his reasons, namely,
"whether the
evidence permitted a reasonable argument that the appellant's employment was not
the major or most significant factor
in the causation of the aggravation or
exacerbation of the underlying disease". Or, put another way, whether
presently available evidence might reasonably be argued as
establishing that the major or most significant contributing factor could
said to be the
employment because it was not possible to
determine what role his employment actually played in the exacerbation of his
spondylosis, as opposed to other factors, including the natural
progression of the degenerative changes in his spine.
[17] Whilst the employer carries the onus of proof on a s 81A application, I
accept the submission put on behalf of the
by his counsel...in
his written submissions, that what the employer is required to prove is not that
there is no liability under s
25 of the Act, but only that there exists, on the
evidentiary material the employer relies upon in the s 81A proceedings, a
chance that the worker will be unable to discharge the onus of proof
that will ultimately rest with the worker by virtue of the Act,
s 49(2)(a), on a
final hearing of the worker's claim. As
put it, ‘the
employer was certainly not required in this instance to positively prove that
some specific factor other than
the worker's employment was the major or most
significant contributing factor’.”
Determination
26. Applying the test set out by Evans J. in St Helens Oysters
Pty Ltd v Coatsworth
[2007] TASSC 90
(2007) 17 Tas R 43
, it is not possible to
determine what role the worker’s employment played in the exacerbation or
aggravation of her disease.
Dr White identified a variety of other plausible
potential causes of the worker’s condition (DQT) that are inconsistent
liability. In these circumstances, on the limited material before the
Tribunal, there is a reasonably arguable case that following
a contested
hearing, the worker’s claim may be rejected.
27. As stated by Pearce J.
in Vos Construction and Joinery Pty Ltd v Norton-Smith
[2016] TASSC 38
Act does not require that the employer case about liability be strong or
compelling, but the case that the claim may ultimately
be rejected must be
reasonably arguable.”
28. I am satisfied on the evidence before the Tribunal that a
reasonably arguable case exists concerning the liability of the employer
compensation. I determine that a reasonably arguable case exists. There will
be orders pursuant to s81A(3)(c) and (d).
