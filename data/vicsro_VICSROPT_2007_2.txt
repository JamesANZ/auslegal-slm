Contractors - Labour and non-labour components (PT-129) [2007] VICSROPT 2 (1 May 2007)
Revenue Rulings
Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
deems a person (whether incorporated or not) who
entered into a `relevant contract' with a business (the
principal) to be an employee of the principal, and
payments to such persons to be wages for the purposes
of the Act. Deemed wages under
Act are subject to pay-roll tax.
While most contracts for the provision for services
come within the meaning of `relevant contracts'
of the Act, there are certain types
of contracts that are specifically excluded from the
definition of `relevant contracts'. One of the exclusions
is a contract which provides materials and equipment
(non-labour component) as well as services, and the
non-labour component exceeds 65 per cent of the
contract amount and all the other conditions specified
in Revenue Ruling PT.123 are met. This is because,
under these circumstances, the provision of services
would be considered as ancillary to the provision of
materials and/or equipment
(section 3(C)(1)(d)
If none of the exclusions in
section 3(C)
applies and the relevant contract includes a non-labour
component, the Commissioner of State Revenue (the
Commissioner) allows the non-labour component to
be deducted from payments made under the contract
because only payments made in respect of labour
are subject to pay-roll tax. A percentage of deduction
(approved deduction) allowed by the Commissioner
is set out in Revenue Ruling PT.122 which varies
according to the profession/trade of the contractor.
The approved deduction is an estimate of supplies
and equipment a contractor would usually provide
as agreed with the representatives of the respective
Uncertainty may arise where a contractor charges
labour and non-labour components of a relevant
contract under separate invoices or itemised separately
under a single invoice. The purpose of this Revenue
Ruling is to clarify which amounts paid under these
circumstances would be deemed as wages and are,
therefore, subject to pay-roll tax.
In determining taxable wages for the purposes of
of the Act, payments made under a
relevant contract can only be reduced by the approved
deduction regardless of the actual amount of non-
labour component charged by the contractor. Where
the labour and non-labour components are charged
separately (whether in a single invoice or otherwise),
the entire sum paid (i.e. payments for both the
labour and non-labour component) less any approved
deduction must be declared as wages for pay-roll
tax purposes.
If a contractor's profession/trade is not listed in
Revenue Ruling PT.122, the principal may apply
in writing to the Commissioner for a private ruling.
Similarly where the principals believe that they are
entitled to a higher percentage of deduction than
the approved deduction, they may apply to the
Commissioner for a private ruling. In applying for
a private ruling, details on the cost of materials
and equipment provided by the contractor and the
amount(s) paid to the contractor must be provided
Please note that rulings do not have the force of
law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
