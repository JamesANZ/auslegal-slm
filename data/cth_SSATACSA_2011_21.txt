Decision of the Tribunal
August 2011 the Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review and

depart from the administrative
assessment of child support.
Date of dispatch
6 September
REASONS FOR
Introduction
Wallace and Mr Fredericks have three children together: Tammy, aged 14, Maria,
aged 11 and Christopher, aged 7. Ms Wallace has
greater than primary care of
the children for child support purposes.
Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989
(‘the Assessment
Act’), the child support payable is administratively assessed according to
a formula which incorporates
variables including the parents’ adjusted
taxable incomes and their percentages of care of the children of the assessment
well as the need to provide for their other relevant
Assessment Act also provides for a departure from the administrative assessment
in certain circumstances. Ms Wallace lodged a
departure application on 6
September 2010. The application was allowed by a senior case officer who made a
decision to depart from
the administrative assessment. Mr Fredericks objected to
that decision but the objection was disallowed by an objections officer.
Fredericks sought further review and the matter was heard by the Tribunal on 15
August 2011.
Fredericks gave sworn evidence at the hearing. Ms Wallace elected not to
participate in the hearing, but remained a party to the
review. The Tribunal
also had regard to the documents provided by the Child Support Agency
(‘the CSA’) (exhibits 1 and
C), documentation provided by Mr
Fredericks (exhibit A) and Ms Wallace (exhibit B).
to section 98C of the Assessment Act, a decision maker must be satisfied of the
following three matters before making a decision
which departs from the
administrative assessment:
(i) that one, or more than one, of the grounds for departure referred to
in subsection 117(2) exists;
(ii) that it would be:
(A) just and equitable as regards the child, the liable parent, and the
carer entitled to child support; and
(B) otherwise proper;
to make a particular determination under this Part;
A Ground for Departure
Subparagraphs
117(2)(c)(ia) and 117(2)(c)(ib) of the Assessment Act, commonly referred to as
Reason 8, provide as grounds for departure:
(c) that, in the special circumstances of the case, application in
relation to the child of the provisions of this Act relating to
administrative
assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable
determination of the level of financial support
to be provided by the liable
parent for the child:
(ia) because of the income, property and financial resources of either
(ib) because of the earning capacity of either parent ...
Wallace argued that Mr Fredericks’ taxable income understated his true
income. She based this assertion on an examination
of some of his bank
statements which showed regular deposits of $1,500 per week ($78,000 per
Fredericks’ only current source of income relate to his current
employment.
December 2009, Mr Fredericks entered into a business relationship to undertake a
project with Mr William Barry. The relationship
was structured as a corporate
entity in which Mr Fredericks and Mr Barry had equal shares (the Business). Mr
Fredericks lent the
Business $50,000 and Mr Barry has lent a further $657,000.
A bank loan was obtained for a further $1,375,000. The business project
now been finalised and is being marketed. Interest has been weak and at this
stage it appears Mr Fredericks and Mr Barry will
not recoup their
investments.
Fredericks and Mr Barry agreed that between December 2009 and May 2011 (15
months) he would receive drawings of $74,000 as payment
for constructing the
project. Mr Fredericks submitted that he took these drawings as weekly payments
of up to $1,500 and that these
were the payments identified by Ms
Fredericks’ 2009/2010 Income Tax Return reveals that he received $28,500
(after tax)
from the Business. His 2010/11 return discloses receipt
of $40,400 (after tax).
In total this means that he has received
$78,900 from the Business. This income tallies with the bank statements
provided to the
Tribunal and it is clear that Mr Fredericks’ income tax
returns represent a fair declaration of the income received by Mr Fredericks
each of the relevant tax years.
Fredericks became unemployed when his contract with the Business concluded in
May 2011. He immediately sought income support payments
from Centrelink but as
yet has not received a payment. He has since obtained work
(commencing in
mid July 2011) and currently earns $822 per week before tax ($42,773 per
He is continuing discussions with Centrelink for the
recovery of arrears of Newstart allowance and will include any that he receives
in his 2011/12 income tax return.
Fredericks supplied the Tribunal with extensive disclosure of his business
accounts and source documents. A close examination
of those documents reveals
that there is no apparent source of income which is different to that attested
to by Mr Fredericks. The
Tribunal finds that Mr Fredericks’ taxable
income (on which any child support assessment would be based) is an accurate
of his income for child support purposes and further that it has been
so at all material times. There is no suggestion that Mr Fredericks
access to other undisclosed financial resources.

assessment application, the administrative assessments
would likely proceed as

prior year’s earnings he would have underpaid
child support (by
approximately $7,725) in Period One, overpaid child support in Period Two (by
approximately $3,500) and be likely
to overpay child support in Period Three (by
approximately $1,600 per annum). However, the Tribunal has found nothing
untoward in
the calculation of Mr Fredericks’ income and, while the
fluctuations in that income (combined with the timing differences required
the Act) have impacted the assessment, the Tribunal is confident that over time
the differentials will be made up as each successive
Tribunal is satisfied that the application of the administrative assessment
based on Mr Fredericks’ taxable incomes would
not result in an unjust and
inequitable determination of child support payable. As a result, the Tribunal
concludes that a ground

respect of Mr Fredericks’
income and financial resources does not
section 103S of the
Child Support (Registration & Collection) Act
, the Tribunal may affirm, vary or set aside a decision. In doing so,
the Tribunal can exercise all the powers and discretions that
are conferred to
the Registrar under that Act. For the reasons outlined above, the Tribunal finds
that there is no reason for a departure
decision to be made in the current case.
The Tribunal will therefore set aside the decision under review and direct that
child support
be assessed in accordance with the administrative
On 27 August 2011 the
Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review and substitute a
decision that there is no ground to
depart from the administrative assessment of
child support.
