Alteration of other rules of organisation.
On 6 November 2024 the Clubs Australia - Industrial (CAI) lodged with
the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) a notice and declaration
setting out
particulars of alterations to its rules.
The CAI seeks certification of the alterations under
section 159
Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009
On the information contained in the notice and declaration, I am
satisfied the alterations have been made under the rules of the organisation.
The particulars set out alterations to
- Financial
Requirements.
The alterations to
remove the now obsolete provisions
requiring officers to complete financial management training, as this obligation
is currently
enshrined in
section 293K
of the Act. Further amendments to the
Rule remove the provisions outlining specific financial disclosure obligations.
As required
section 141(1)(ca)
of the Act however, the Rule still retains
the provision requiring the CAI to develop and implement financial policies and
in relation to expenditure.
In my opinion, the alterations comply with and are not contrary to
the Act, the
Fair Work Act 2009
, modern awards and enterprise agreements,
are not otherwise contrary to law and were made under the rules of the
organisation. I
certify accordingly under
subsection 159(1)
of the Act.
