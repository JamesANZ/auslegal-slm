The biggest marine documentary
United Nations adopts the ‘Rotterdam Rules’
African piracy on IMO agenda
by Mikhail Kashubsky
The biggest marine documentary
Headed by renowned French film director and actor Jacques Perrin,
Galatée Film Productions, a French-based production house specialising
big screen nature documentaries, is completing a new film about the
world’s oceans.
is claimed to be the biggest-budget cinema documentary ever
produced. It
has a budget of about $US60 million. The feature is being
developed by Galatée Films in partnership with Disneynature. The producers
have stated that:
explores the unrecognised, hidden face of the Earth.
also makes it alarmingly clear that the marine world, despite its fascinating
wealth and complexity, is fragile. It is living on
borrowed time, threatened by
human actions: overfishing, pollution, coastal destruction, climatic changes.
Five years in production, one year behind schedule, a screenplay
in constant development, cutting-edge technological inventions made
at the last
minute, Galatée cameramen dispersed across all the seas of the world,
several hundred biologists on hand, the European
Space Agency and the scientists
of the international project the Census of Marine Life working overtime, the
film is at last scheduled
for release later this year.
The Galatée team has received the support of the Sloan Foundation and
has been working closely with the Census of Marine Life
(Census) scientists to
ensure the scientific accuracy of the film. The production benefits from the
precious information of an entire
network of experts spread out over the planet.
In fact, the cooperation between Galatée Films and the Census benefits
both parties. The Census assisted with arranging authorisations
certain territorial waters where marine mammals are protected by extremely
strict legislation. In exchange, the scientists
gain from the producers’
sophisticated technology and logistics whereby they are finally able to go up
close to animals they
have previously only observed from a distance.
The footage and images sometimes give scientists information that was
previously beyond their reach. For example, one of the technological
employed in the production (which could benefit scientists) is an underwater
microscope manipulated by a robotic arm with
the sole aim of filming larvae as
they have never before been filmed.
Last year, Australian and French movie-makers were filming super macro
segments for the movie in ReefHQ, the world’s biggest
living coral reef
aquarium, in north Queensland.

With less than two hundred days before the end of filming, the producers hope
to achieve an ambitious task of filming the birth of
a humpback whale in
Polynesia, a spectacle that no human eye has ever witnessed before.
Being such a major, technologically advanced production,
supposedly reveal new mysteries of the world ocean.

United Nations adopts the ‘Rotterdam
On 11 December 2008, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted, at
session, a new global cargo liability convention.
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage
of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea
aims to create a modern and uniform law
concerning the international carriage of goods which include an international
sea leg, but
which is not limited to port-to-port carriage. The convention
replaces the Hague-Visby and Hamburg Rules, and it has become known
‘Rotterdam Rules’.
The draft convention was prepared over thirteen sessions from April 2002 to
January 2008, and was submitted for the approval of the
United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). Extensive negotiation by the
Member States and observers of UNCITRAL
has resulted in overwhelming support for
a significant increase to the limits on carrier liability for cargo loss or
damage that
apply in most countries.
The final draft text was approved by UNCITRAL on 3 July 2008 and subsequently
presented to the UN General Assembly for conclusion.
After considering the final
draft, the General Assembly, among other things, declared that it is:
Convinced that the adoption of uniform rules to modernize and harmonize the
rules that govern the international carriage of goods
involving a sea leg would
enhance legal certainty, improve efficiency and commercial predictability in the
international carriage
of goods and reduce legal obstacles to the flow of
international trade among all States.
The Rotterdam Rules
comprise 96 articles arranged in 18 Chapters. By contrast, Hague-Visby Rules
contain only 10 articles and Hamburg
Rules have 34 articles. The Rotterdam Rules
will be open for signature by all States at Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on 23

African piracy on IMO agenda
Following the adoption of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions
1846 and 1851, on 2 and 16 December 2008 respectively,
which extended
UNSC’s authorisation for countries to enter Somalia’s territorial
waters using ‘all necessary measures’
to counter piracy and armed
robbery at sea, the IMO has already taken a number of steps this year to tackle
the piracy problem in
the region.
The first development was the establishment of a Contact Group on Piracy off
the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS), in early January 2009,
with the primary mission of
facilitating discussion and coordination of actions among States and
organisations aimed at addressing
the issue. CGPCS, which includes the IMO
Secretariat, has formed four working groups.
IMO also convened a high-level meeting in Djibouti between 26-29 January
2009, to help address the issue of piracy and armed robbery
against ships off
the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. The most significant outcome of
the meeting was the adoption of the
Code of Conduct concerning the Repression
of Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the
Gulf of Aden.
The Code is based on the
Regional Cooperation Agreement on
Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia
(ReCAAP) and
considered an important starting point for successful co-operation and
coordination in the region.
State parties intend to fully co-operate in the arrest, investigation and
prosecution of persons who have committed piracy or are
reasonably suspected of
having committed piracy, to seize suspect ships and the property on board such
ships, and rescue ships, persons,
and property subject to acts of piracy.
IMO Secretary-General, Efthimios Mitropoulos, has also urged the Nigerian
Government to take action to help reduce the number of acts
of piracy and armed
robbery in the Gulf of Guinea and in the waters off the coast of Nigeria. In the
meeting with Nigeria’s
new Minister of Transport, Mr Ibrahim Bio, which
took place on 20 February 2009 at the IMO Headquarters, Mr Mitropoulos stressed
that ‘urgent action was needed to assure the international maritime
community of Nigeria’s commitment to address the
problem on a priority
A few days after the meeting with Nigeria’s Minister of Transport, Mr
Mitropoulos officially opened, on 24 February 2009, the
first meeting of a
Working Group charged with considering operational coordination,
information-sharing, regional capacity building,
and the possible establishment
of a regional coordination centre. Working Group Two met in early March 2009 to
discuss legal issues.
