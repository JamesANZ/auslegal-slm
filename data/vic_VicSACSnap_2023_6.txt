Sentencing Snapshot 278: Sentencing Trends for Obtaining Financial
Advantage by Deception in the Higher Courts of Victoria 2017-18
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
obtaining a financial advantage by deception in the County and Supreme Courts of
Victoria (the higher courts)
from 2017-18 to

offences is available on
Advisory Council Statistics (SACStat)
A person who, by any deception, dishonestly obtains any financial advantage
for themselves or another person is guilty of obtaining
a financial advantage by
deception. Obtaining a financial advantage by deception is an indictable offence
that carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of up to
1,200 penalty units.

This Snapshot focuses on cases where obtaining a financial advantage by
deception was the principal offence, that is, cases where
obtaining a financial
advantage by deception was the offence that received the most severe
Obtaining a financial advantage by deception was the principal offence in
1.7% of cases sentenced in the higher courts between 2017-18
and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 145 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of obtaining a financial advantage

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an immediate
imprisonment term of less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole
period. For terms
between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the
discretion to fix a non-parole period. For terms of imprisonment of 2 years
more, the court must impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the
court fixes a non-parole period, the person must
serve that period before
becoming eligible for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the
person must serve the entirety
of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 88 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for obtaining a financial
advantage by deception, 18 were not eligible to have
a non-parole period imposed
because their total effective sentence was less than one year. Of the 70 people
who were eligible to
have a non-parole period fixed, 66 were given a non-parole
period (94.3%).
Figure 6 shows the non-parole periods in cases where the principal offence
was obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Non-parole
periods ranged from
6 months to 7 years, while the median non-parole period was 2 years (meaning
that half of the non-parole periods
were below 2 years and half were above).
There were 22 people sentenced to imprisonment for obtaining a financial
advantage by deception
who did not have a non-parole period imposed.
The most common range of non-parole periods was 1 to less than 2 years (24
