FROM RISK MANAGEMENT TO OPERATION RESILIENCE: A COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS OF CPS 230 OPERATION RISK MANAGEMENT
I INTRODUCTION
On July 1, 2025, the Australia Prudential Regulation Authority
(‘APRA’) will formally implement the Prudential Standard
Operational Risk Management (‘CPS
This marks a
significant shift in Australia financial regulation from traditional operation
risk management toward a comprehensive
operational resilience framework. This
standard will replace several existing APRA standards, establishing an
integrated regulatory
framework that combines three pillars: operational risk
management, business continuity management and service provider
management.
The core competitiveness of the general insurance entity lies in its risk
management capabilities. Its business model depends on precise
identification, assessment, and
An effective risk
regulatory framework is crucial for ensuring the financial soundness of general
insurance companies, protecting
policyholder interests, and maintaining
financial system stability. CPS 230 applies to multiple financial sectors,
including the
general insurance industry, and imposes diverse and complex
compliance requirements on the insurance companies.
This article aims to critically analyse the impact of CPS 230 on the
operational resilience framework of general insurance companies.
It focuses on
three core questions: First, it examines the relationship between operational
risk management and resilience, analysing
the fundamental reasons behind
APRA’s push to transition from risk management to resilience building.
Second, it analyses the
innovational requirements of CPS 230 for the general
insurance industry, including board responsibilities, management of key service
providers, and specific requirements for defining critical operations (claims)
and setting tolerance levels. Third, it evaluates
the adaptability of CPS 230 in
the context of digital transformation and its potential regulatory
challenges.
This article employs a comparative research method, including compares CPS
230 with its predecessors CPS 231
and CPS 232
to identify substantial
differences and the compliance challenges brought by the new framework, and it
conducts a horizontal comparison

valuable insights into how financial regulation is evolving
globally and offers
a foundation for assessing both the merits and challenges of Australia’s
approach to operational resilience

III KEY INNOVATIONS AND TRANSFORMATION IN CPS 230’S
OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK
CPS 230 is a comprehensive operational resilience regulatory standard divided
into five main sections. This includes risk management
framework, roles and
responsibilities, operational risk management, business continuity, and service
However, in its
response to submissions, APRA further clarifies that the core requirements of
CPS 230 are ‘operational risk
management’, ‘critical service
provider management’ and ‘business resilience and
continuity.
There is no
correspondence between the two categories. The three pillars represent CPS
230’s policy objectives,
and the compliance requirements corresponding to the latter objectives are
distributed among the five requirements of CPS 230.
This Part analyses the compliance impact on insurance companies from four
dimensions, starting from an examination of actual changes
of regulatory
A From Risk Management to Operation Resilience: A Paradigm
Shift in Regulatory Philosophy
Although CPS 230 is named ‘operational risk
management’,
its essence
is beyond the scope of traditional risk management. Traditional operational risk
in the capital framework is defined
as the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external

preventive approach.

on probability prediction and consequence control
Comparatively, operational resilience represents a more holistic concept that
recognises the inevitability of risk and emphasises
the ability to maintain
critical operations when disruptions occur, as well as the ability to recover
quickly from them.
has been clearly stated in the Discussion Paper published by APRA, which
indicates that CPS 230 aims to drive regulated
entities to establish ‘the
ability to maintain critical business operations during severe operational
disruptions’.
This shifts
the focus to business continuity and resilience as goal-oriented objectives,
rather than merely remaining at the level
of risk avoidance or reduction.
According to APRA’s guidelines, operation resilience is the expected
goal of operational risk
management.
This statement
accurately summarises the relationship between the two – risk management
is the means and operation resilience
is the end.
The Royal Commission’s Final Report revealed
systemic failures in claims handling by insurance companies, exposing the
limitations
of relying solely on risk control in complex operational
environments.
This result
suggests that relying solely on risk controls is no longer sufficient to deal
with the complexity of the operating environment.
Furthermore, in the post-pandemic era, insurance entities face emerging
risks. Many companies are still adapting to the ‘pandemic

supply chain disruptions, accelerated
digital and technological adoption,
enhanced cybersecurity and data risks, and adverse weather conditions have all
contributed to
uncertainty.
In this context, it
is no longer sufficient for the regulatory focus to be purely on risk avoidance,
it is essential to ensure that
business-critical services remain operational
even in the face of unavoidable disruptions.
Notably, while CPS 230 demands higher resilience standards, it simultaneously
adopts a proportionality principle, allowing insurance
companies to customise
implementation plans according to their size, business complexity and risk
profile. This flexibility enables
insurance companies of different sizes to
address the new regulatory requirements appropriately while achieving genuine
improvement.
Overall, CPS 230 represents a fundamental shift in APRA regulation –
from reactive risk prevention and control to proactive
resilience building. This
shift will reshape general insurers’ risk management practices, business
continuity planning and
organisational structures, making the industry more
capable of responding to operational disruptions of all kinds and better
policyholder interests. Furthermore, it reflects a common feature of
international financial regulatory trends – in an environment

executives,
CPS 230 emphasises
the board’s collective governance by clarifying the board’s ultimate
responsibility for oversight
of operational risk management, particularly in
ensuring business continuity and third-party risk
management.
This complementary
approach extends accountability from the individual level to the
institution’s daily risk governance, forming
a more comprehensive
accountability framework.
A significant innovation in CPS 230 is elevating board accountability from
traditional risk management to operation resilience. Traditionally,
responsibilities in risk management primarily focused on approving risk policies
and overseeing risk control measures –
that is, preventive
responsibilities.
CPS 230 now
requires boards to be accountable for overall operational continuity, reflecting
an outcome-oriented requirement.
This expanded accountability requires the boards to demonstrate that their
companies can maintain critical operations during severe
disruption events and
restore full functionality within acceptable
timeframes.
Multiple provisions
distributed across different sections of CPS 230 form a comprehensive board
accountability framework covering
all aspects of operation resilience. This
framework is manifested in four key areas:
1. Paragraph 20 establishes the basic principle of board accountability:
‘The Board of an APRA-regulated entity is ultimately
responsible for the
oversight of the entity's operational risk management, including the management
of business continuity and service
arrangements.’
provision has programmatic significance, transcending the traditional view of
operational risk as a technical issue and clearly
elevating it to a governance
responsibility at the board level. Compared to CPS 231 and CPS 232, this
formulation integrates previously
fragmented outsourcing management and business
continuity responsibilities into a unified accountability framework, creating a
comprehensive scope for board oversight.
2. Paragraph 21 requires the board to ‘ensure that the entity
establishes clear roles and responsibilities for senior management
in relation
to operational risk
management’,
strengthening
the board’s organisational structure responsibility. This provision
directly links corporate governance responsibilities
with operational risk
management, establishing a top-down accountability chain by clarifying the
board’s leading role in responsibility
allocation.
3. Paragraph 22 details the board’s three core responsibilities, which
constitute the substantive content of the accountability
mechanism and
correspond to CPS 230’s three core
4. CPS 230 extends board accountability throughout the operational resilience
management lifecycle:
(a) Pre-planning stage
Boards are responsible for approving risk management frameworks, business
continuity plans, and service provider management policies,
and must regularly
receive information about operational risk profiles and trends to ensure Boards
can make informed decisions.
(b) Continuous monitoring stage
Paragraph 41 requires reporting to the board any failure to meet tolerance
levels and remediation
(c) Post-audit evaluation
Paragraph 60 requires the internal audit function to regularly report to the
Board on whether service provider arrangements comply
with policy
requirements.
This lifecycle accountability mechanism ensures that Boards not only
participate in policy formulation but also continuously monitor
implementation
effectiveness and drive necessary
improvements.
In summary, by systematically reconfiguring the Board accountability
framework to closely align corporate governance with operational
resilience, CPS
230 responds to the Royal Commission’s call for greater accountability of
senior executives in insurance entities
and promotes a paradigm shift in the
governance of insurers from a compliance-process-orientated approach to an
outcome-orientated
C Critical Operation Identification and Risk Tolerance
Given that boards are assigned ultimate responsibility for assuming operation
resilience, CPS 230 introduces two mechanisms: ‘critical
and ‘tolerance
These mechanisms
transform abstract operational resilience into specific, actionable regulatory
standards. In this framework, critical
operation serves as the foundation for
determining the direction of a company's resilience building, while tolerance
levels provide
quantifiable assessment standards for resilience
construction.
Paragraph 37 of CPS 230 explicitly requires APRA-regulated entities to
identify their critical
operations.
These are business
operations that, if disrupted, would cause significant impact to customers,
counterparties, the entity itself,
or the financial system. Here, the degree of
impact on financial system is introduced as a criterion for determining critical

in CPS 232.
For insurance companies, CPS 230 makes a breakthrough by directly designating
‘claims processing’ as a critical operation

seriously undermined the social function
of the insurance industry and directly impacted CPS 230’s clear
positioning of claims
as a critical operation, reflecting a regulatory shift in
thinking from crisis response to risk
prevention.
D Tolerance Level Setting: Quantitative Standards for
Resilience Management
A major innovation in CPS 230 is the requirement to set specific, measurable
tolerance levels for each critical operation. Paragraph
38 states that
APRA-regulated entities must set clear tolerance levels for each critical

downtime, maximum acceptable data loss and minimum service levels. This

recommendations following the flood events. It requires insurance companies to

time but also on service quality and data safety.
Compared to the general ‘recovery objectives and strategies’ in CPS
232, these detailed standards make resilience building more targeted and
measurable.
To ensure that tolerance levels are truly achievable in practice, CPS 230
introduces systematic testing
These transform
abstract resilience metrics into attainable business objectives. Compared to CPS
232, CPS 230’s testing requirements
are more systematic and directly
linked to tolerance levels, forming a complete resilience management

This reflects the
fact that CPS 231 is based on the principle of activity-orientation, focusing on
which activities are outsourced.
In contrast, CPS 230 significantly expands the regulatory scope by adopting
the concept of ‘material service provider’,
covering all service
provision arrangements that support critical operations, regardless of their
contractual form.
Further, it
explicitly lists four mandatory types of substantive services for the insurance
industry, including insurance
This scope expansion reflects regulator recognition of the complex dependency
networks in modern insurance operations, acknowledging
that even non-outsourcing
relationships can significantly impact operational resilience.
Another major innovation in CPS 230 is the introduction of
‘fourth-party risk’ management requirements. This requirement
extends the risk management perspective from direct service providers to the
entire service chain.
Overall, CPS 230’s service provider management framework, together with
board accountability mechanisms and critical business
identification frameworks,
constitutes a complete operational resilience regulatory system. This system
requires insurance companies
to manage their external dependencies from a more
holistic and systematic perspective, ensuring the resilience of critical
within complex modern service ecosystems.
IV COMPARISON OF INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
2025 is not only the year when CPS 230 will be formally implemented, but also
when the EU’s
and the UK’s operational
resilience-related regime will be formally
implemented.
Comparing the same
regulatory measures in other advanced international jurisdictions will help to
better understand the internal
logic and regulatory direction of CPS 230, as
well as to explore the potential risks and challenges associated with it.

requirements.
CPS 230 presents more innovative features suited to Australia's local
context, positioning itself between principle-based regulation
and detailed
process regulation. Particularly through the introduction of fourth-party risk
management and the clear definition of
critical operations, it demonstrates the
Australian regulatory authority's forward-looking perspective and strong
understanding of
emerging risks.
V CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES FOR CPS 230
A Absence of Proportionality and Compliance
Any compliance initiative typically faces criticism of overburdening, and CPS
230 is no exception.
Although APRA claims that they follow the principle of proportionality and
has provided some flexibility by extending implementation
deadlines and
adjusting final text content,
the lack of distinction between significant financial entities may still impose
excessive compliance burdens on small and medium-sized
This differs from
the UK and especially the EU’s direct emphasis on proportionality
principles, which both take into account
the innovative role of small medium
enterprises in the chain and the greater compliance pressures they face. Without
offering more
flexible compliance measures for small businesses, flexible
regulatory oversight and compliance assistance during the initial compliance
period become very important.
Current compliance pressures may force small and medium-sized insurance
companies to exit the market or be

market concentration and hindering the development of a more dynamic and
competitive market.

would greatly alleviate these burdens.
VI CONCLUSION
This article provides a comprehensive analysis of CPS 230 and explores
APRA’s regulatory shift from traditional risk management
to operational
resilience by comparing the CPS 231 and CPS 232 with relevant operational
resilience regulation in the EU and UK.
