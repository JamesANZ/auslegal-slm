Chapter One: Introduction
This report focuses on the policing of cannabis, amphetamine and other
illicit drug use in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities
and remote areas, including the role of police in efforts to reduce drug-related
Recent shifts in drug supply and use appear to be exposing isolated
Aboriginal communities to unexpected difficulties. Cannabis is
now flowing into
remote areas at an alarming rate, a trade fuelled by high demand and extreme
profi ts but increasingly facilitated
by profi teers from outside the community
rather than resident user-dealers.
Despite a sharp rise in cannabis smoking, particularly among young people,
there is no evidence of a corresponding fall in drinking.
Alcohol and
alcohol-related conflicts remain an urgent issue for most communities, while the
illicit drug trade is adding fresh and
dynamic impediments to an already complex
policing environment.
Recent rapid uptake in use and availability of
Although cannabis has been present in rural and remote communities for some
years, much of the increased cannabis use noted in remote
areas appears to be
very recent, to involve large numbers of first-time users and to involve binge
use of other substances (Clough
et al. 2004b).
A survey in the mid-1980s found little or no cannabis use in the Northern
Territory’s ‘Top End’ communities. Police
sources confirmed
that cannabis use was rare in remote Northern Territory communities before 1991
(Select Committee on Substance
Abuse in the Community 2003), but began to notice
and warn of an emerging market in remote areas in the mid-1990s (ABCI 1999).
Surveys across the East Arnhem Land region showed that cannabis use by males
aged over 15 years quickly increased to 31% by the late
1990s, then to 55% in
1999. Female cannabis use jumped from 8% to 13% in 1999. By 2001-02 regular
cannabis usage had surged to 62-76%
of males and 9-35% of females aged 13-34
years (Clough et al. 2004b). The accelerating use was most noticeable at
individual community
level. Between 1999 and 2000 the proportion of males using
cannabis in one East Arnhem Land locality almost doubled, from 21% to
cannabis use among females emerged for the first time, with up to 20% trying the
drug that year (Clough et al. 2004b).
Expert evidence and public meetings in
Lajamanu, Tiwi Islands, Jabiru and Katherine noted that remote communities
across the Northern
Territory all recently experienced similar rapid increases
in cannabis use, plentiful supply from external sources, and community
cooperation in distribution (Select Committee on Substance Abuse in the
Community 2003).
Although others have noted that cannabis use is becoming more prevalent among
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders elsewhere in
Australia (ANCD 2002), there
is little published information detailing changing patterns or rates of use.
Most studies are neither
current nor pertinent to remote area populations.
Consequently, relevant information exists for just a few localities in the
Territory and rural communities elsewhere.
National, state and territory drug reporting systems have generally not
detected these patterns in remote Aboriginal communities.
The dearth of relevant
information limits the ability to develop strategies to act against substance
abuse, despite its importance
to Aboriginal health in general (Clough et al.
Surveys of Aboriginal community attitudes to drug use indicate that more
immediate concerns, about excessive alcohol consumption and
associated violence
and disorder, can overshadow community concerns about substances such as
cannabis even if the longer-term harms
associated with cannabis smoking are
understood (AIHW 1995). Since the late 1990s there has also been wider
availability and use
of cannabis nationally, a trend Rey & Tennant (2002)
link to broader social changes: “The ready availability of the drug,
increasing social disapproval of cigarette smoking, stern drink driving laws,
and perceptions that cannabis is safe or less harmful
than cigarettes or alcohol
may explain these changes”.
