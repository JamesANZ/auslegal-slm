Response from  WorkSafe received 12 March 2024.
Work Health and Safety Act 2012
, persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs) are responsible for inspecting and maintaining tractors to ensure they are
safe to use.
As noted in Coroner McTaggart’s report, in 1982 legislation was introduced to mandate the use of roll-over protection for tractors.
A tractor must not be used in a workplace unless it is securely fitted with a roll-over protective structure (ROPS). This does not
apply to a tractor under 560kg or over 15,000kg, a tractor installed in a fixed position and incapable of moving, or a tractor used
for a historical purpose or activity. If the tractor is used where it is too low for the tractor to work with the ROPS in place,
then the ROPS may be lowered or removed only for this situation and only if other measures to reduce the risk of roll-over are in
place. ROPS must comply with the relevant Australian Standard.
If a tractor was manufactured prior to 1982 and does not have a ROPS, it must be fitted with one before being used in a workplace.
While consideration has been given to the prohibition of tractors manufactured before 1982, feedback from the rural industry is that
this is not supported, and will bring significant cost to affected businesses, many of which are small, family-based operations.
Alternatively, tractors can be fitted with a variety of other attachments and implements designed for specific purposes, including
a STAP. However, each particular attachment that is fitted to a tractor introduces a new set of hazards, even if the tractor itself
is set up for safe use. Planning and selecting the correct equipment for the intended task and terrain is an important step in managing
risks. The use of a STAP may in some instances create a higher risk for the user of the tractor than if one was not fitted. This
is particularly the case where the STAP was not designed specifically for the tractor that it is fitted to.
Since the release of Coroner McTaggart’s findings, WorkSafe Tasmania has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving
awareness of the risks associated with tractors on farms and educating businesses on how to reduce these risks. The Safe Farming
Tasmania (SFT) program was launched in 2014. The SFT program was designed to raise awareness of farm safety issues state-wide. The
SFT program is a joint initiative between WorkSafe Tasmania and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment, and has been
modelled on WorkSafe Tasmania’s existing Work Health and Safety Advisory Service.
The SFT program was developed in consultation with the rural industry, and is strongly supported by an industry-led stakeholder reference
group. This work is gaining national attention for its approach to raising awareness of work health and safety in the rural sector.
The SFT program aims to reduce farm related death, injury and disease, and improve the health and safety of workers in the Tasmanian
rural sector by:
* raising awareness of farm safety issues;
* encouraging discussions about safe farming;
* building leadership safety cultures and influencing attitudes;
* producing and disseminating targeted information; and
* working with industry stakeholders to provide training and education.
In the financial year to 30 June 2023, the SFT Program provided over 200 requests for guidance and advice. SFT is also collaborating
with business partners to run a series of tractor safety awareness sessions throughout the State including King and Flinders Islands.
Plans are well underway for this to occur.
Since the inception of the program to the end of March 2023, over 315 safety management plans have been developed for and with farmers,
tailored to their individual farm operations. These safety management plans are critical to achieving safer farming practices and
In addition to the SFT Program, the Government offered a Primary Producer Safety Rebate Scheme (the Scheme), which opened on 1 October
2021 and closed on Thursday, 30 June 2022. The Scheme provided a rebate of up to $5,000 for the purchase of workplace safety solutions
to medium, small and owner operator businesses within the agriculture sector in Tasmania.To ensure that the rebate scheme had the
greatest impact on our farmers’ safety, it covered eligible items that mitigate the risk of injury caused by the five major causes
of injury or death in farming:
* body stressing;
* falls, trips and slips of a person;
* being hit by moving objects;
* hitting objects with a part of the body; and
* vehicle incidents.
To address quad bike and tractor (vehicle) incidents, helmets and training were included for applicants who own a quad bike, side-by-side
vehicle, or tractor for work purposes.
The scheme guidelines were developed in consultation with the industry-led Safe Farming Reference Group. They covered a wide range
of commercially available safety measures including, in the cases of vehicles, agricultural side-by-side vehicles, ATV operator protection
devices such as quadbar, helmets, and, for tractors only, rollover protection structures and run over protection devices. In total
786 applications were approved under the Scheme, paying out more than $3.6 million in rebates to primary producers.
