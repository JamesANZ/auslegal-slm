REASONS FOR
appellant is a company undertaking two major residential development projects in
the Tweed Heads area. It applied under the
Government Information (Public
Access) Act 2009
(GIPA) to the respondent council for access to
correspondence between council officers and people concerned about the
development
projects, and their impact on the area.
council refused to disclose some of the information sought. The appellant
applied to the Tribunal for review. The Tribunal upheld
the council's objections
in certain respects. The appellant now appeals in relation to one only of the
Tribunal's rulings, being
the following:
1. The decision of the respondent in regard to the deleted
information in the emails that are item 1 is affirmed.
council filed a notice in reply to the appeal stating that it wished to make no
further submissions, and would submit to the outcome.
We have reviewed the
submissions it made to the Tribunal at first instance in relation to the deleted
information.
White, group adviser to the group of companies of which the appellant company is
part, appeared by leave for the appellant. He
had with him the project manager,
Mr van Rij.
1 contains email correspondence in the period 17 - 21 January 2010 between a
person whose name and related particulars has been
deleted and the council's
director of planning, Mr Vince Connell. The subject matter of item 1 is
described by the Tribunal at [33](a)
of its reasons. As at January 2010 the
development had yet to clear the primary planning approval stage. That has now
occurred and
the development is in the implementation phase (we were told that
10,000 houses were to be built, and the time frame was around 20
Tribunal referred to the relevant provisions of GIPA and engaged in the required
balancing exercise, and we will not repeat the
detail of its approach here. At
[55] the Tribunal said:
55 As I have explained above, the information in item 1 is
essentially a request, by person A, for information from the respondent.
basis of information received by the respondent in the course of its
consultation under
, I accept that the public interest consideration against
disclosure of the name and email address of person A is very strong. And
find, on balance, that the public interest consideration against the disclosure
of person A's name and email address outweighs
the public interest consideration
in favour of disclosure.
response to the council's letter of consultation under
, the writer had
referred to a family circumstance that the writer saw as justifying
non-disclosure.
its submissions the appellant drew attention to internal references in the texts
released that suggested that the writer had made
enquiries of Mr Connell on
behalf of an 'association'.
to the balance to be struck between the public interest in disclosure and the
public interest against disclosure, the appellant
reiterated the case it had
made to the Tribunal below that it was entitled to know who precisely had
communicated with council officers
expressing concern over the development.
appellant also submitted that if, as it surmised, the writer was writing on
behalf of a community organisation the writer's claim
to privacy of identity was
weakened if not lost. The appellant disputed that any reference to an
organisation could be treated as
'personal information' within the meaning of
the Act. 'Personal information' is defined as:
4 Personal information
(1) In this Act,
personal information
means information or an opinion
(including information or an opinion forming part of a database and whether or
not recorded in a
material form) about an individual (whether living or dead)
whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the
information
or opinion.
(2) Personal information includes such things as an individual's
fingerprints, retina prints, body samples or genetic characteristics.
(3) Personal information does not include any of the following:
(a) information about an individual who has been dead for more than 30
(b) information about an individual (comprising the individual's name and
non-personal contact details) that reveals nothing more
than the fact that the
person was engaged in the exercise of public functions,
(c) information about an individual that is of a class, or is contained in a
document of a class, prescribed by the regulations for
the purposes of this
appellant drew attention to a statement in the writer's email that indicated
interest in pursuing a public media campaign against
the development. The
appellant submitted that this was not consistent with the privacy interest to
which the Tribunal had given weight.
appellant also referred to the exclusion from the meaning of personal
information seen in cl 4(3)(b), and, argued that this exclusion
might apply to
the present case. While we doubt that the words "engaged in the exercise of
public functions" is intended to apply
to persons engaged in public activity on
behalf of a private organisation of citizens, there is, as we see it, some merit
general point that a person who makes enquiries as a representative of a
community organisation is in a different position to a person
who makes an
enquiry simply on their own behalf.
Tribunal did not in its reasons separate the issue of the name of the writer
from the issue of the name of the organisation. In
our view, the Tribunal erred
in deciding not to disclose the name of the organisation.
Tribunal proceeded on the basis, as we read the reasons, that both pieces of
information fell within the meaning of 'personal
information'. For the name of
the organisation to be protected as personal information, it would need to be
shown that the revelation
of the name of the organisation would have the result
that the identity of the writer would be 'apparent or can reasonably be
ascertained
from the information'. There was no such finding. In these
circumstances we can not be satisfied that the name of the organisation
have been treated as covered by the meaning of 'personal information'. This
information could not, therefore, be protected
by reference to any public
interest that has as its focus the reasonableness of the non-disclosure of
personal information.
previously noted, the writer had raised a personal circumstance with the council
in opposing disclosure of identity. The Tribunal's
reference to a 'strong'
public interest case against disclosure we take to be a reference to this
matter. We informed the appellant
of our understanding.
indicated that we would uphold the appeal and permit disclosure of the name of
the organisation wherever it appears in the emails
in item 1. The appellant was
satisfied with that outcome. It is unnecessary therefore to consider further the
Tribunal's decision
as it related to the name of the writer of the email.
1. Appeal allowed.
2. Decision under appeal varied, as per [16] of these reasons.
