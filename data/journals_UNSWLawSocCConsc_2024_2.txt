Court Of Conscience
The Hon Tom Bathurst AM
I think that no one would deny that we are living in times of almost
unprecedented change and associated turbulence. This country,
in common with the
rest of the world, is facing extraordinary challenges in areas such as climate
change, other environmental factors,
artificial intelligence and crypto
currency, just to name a few. In this country, as well as in many other
countries, we face the
challenges of reversing the wrongs done in the past to
Indigenous people, ensuring their traditions, cultures and rights to country
properly recognised, making sure minorities whether by virtue of ethnic origin,
religious beliefs, sexuality or other characteristics
are treated equally, and
ensuring the rights of disadvantaged people in our society are properly
The law cannot provide a solution to all these challenges. What it should
seek to do is to provide a framework within which these
challenges can be met
and with which people’s basic rights can be protected at a time of
dramatic change coupled with a degree
of social upheaval. For this to occur, it
is essential that our legal framework properly responds to these emerging
That is why law reform is so important. Let me emphasise that law reform is
not a knee-jerk reaction to issues as they emerge. It
involves a clear
identification of the issues, consultation and consideration of alternate
solutions before reaching a conclusion
as to the best method to proceed. It must
be recognised that in many cases there will not be a universally acceptable
solution for
the problem nor necessarily a perfect solution, but it is a process
which must be undertaken.
In that context, this book is an important book. The distinguished
contributors traverse the critical areas where it may be said that
the law has
failed to keep up with changes in society and provide a proper framework within
which the emerging challenges can be
Thus, the Honourable Michael Kirby addresses the problem that people from
non-majoritarian sexual orientation and gender identity
have been left behind by
lawmakers. The failure of anti-discrimination legislation both in this State and
nationally in dealing with
these issues provides ample testimony to that
failure. The benefit of it being addressed is self-evident; not only will it
basic human rights to which these minority groups are entitled but it
will also generate a culture of community respect for these
groups. In that
context, Professor Rosalind Croucher, the former Chairperson of the Australian
Law Reform Commission, emphasises
the need for a Human Rights Act for
The issue of climate change is dealt with from a number of different
perspectives. Justice Preston looks at the issue from the perspective
members of the community have a duty to respect, protect and fulfill the right
to a clean and healthy environment. Associate
Professor Faith Gordon emphasises
the importance of climate change to young people, those most likely to be
affected, and the potential
of the law to address the issue. Courtney Hall
addresses the issue of management of private investment in the green market,
I think will require regulatory intervention in the near future.
Two articles deal with the need to address injustice to Indigenous people. Dr
Keon-Cohen argues convincingly that providing justice
to Aboriginal communities,
particularly their relationship with government, will not occur without a
systemic shift in community
attitudes, something which to say the least may be
difficult to achieve having regard to the failure of the Voice referendum. In
another article, Mahlia Garay, Lucy-Ann Kelley and Annaliese Gielingh urge for
legislation to require judicial officers to recognise
the harm resulting from
the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents.
The other chapters in the book cover a range of topics where legal reform
will be necessary to ensure that the law adequately serves
the community. In
addition to the topics that I have mentioned above, they include issues relating
to corporate criminal conduct,
the need for reform to defamation law, privacy
protection, the danger of algorithmic assessment in the immigration process,
from the tax compliance burden and the need for legal services reform to
fully harness the potential of innovation and technology.
All the authors are to be congratulated on the learning and insight they have
provided with their contributions. The Editorial Board
of the Court of
Conscience should also be congratulated for their initiative in putting together
the book. It is a remarkable achievement.
