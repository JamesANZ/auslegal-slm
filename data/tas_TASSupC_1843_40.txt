Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land
Montagu J., 23 October 1843
Hobart Town Advertiser
, October 1843
Before Mr. Justice Montagu, and a Civil Jury
George Meadowcroft, William Driscoll, and Charles Baker, were indicted for having on the 12th of August last, robbed William
Bell of four half crowns and 2s, and putting him in grievous bodily fear. A second count laid the money as the property of George
The Solicitor-general when the jury list was called over, challenged those gentlemen who had been on the jury in the case
of Butterfield for rape, and who had been locked up from Saturday evening to Monday evening. The motive of the learned gentleman
seemed to be to excuse them from farther attendance, on the ground of their having already given so much of their time to the public
at these sittings.
His Honor observed that it was unusual to challenge, except in cases arising from incompetency, or supposed bias for or
against a prisoner. As to the jury in Butterfield's case, he would trust his life in their hands, but he would repeat it was
unusual to excuse gentlemen from attending on the grounds of personal convenience or consideration.
The Solicitor-general then opened the case to the jury, and called a number of witnesses, from whose testimony it appeared
that the robbery was attended by great personal violence, and committed under circumstances which aggravated the offence.
The three prisoners and the prosecutor, together with a number of other convicts, were on the 12th of August last, in
the tread-mill ward of the penitentiary, and the robbery was committed between 12 and 1 o'clock, in the water-closet. William
Bell, the prosecutor, was known to have the money concealed on his person, sewed up in a piece of shirting. He did not know how much
there was, it having been given him to take care of by George Beal, another prisoner. He was assailed on all sides, thrown the ground,
and gave the packet up to Driscoll, under an impression that they would have taken his life. Driscoll put a knife to his throat and
swore he would immediately "cut his b_____y head off," having hold of him by the shoulder with the left hand, whilst the
prisoner Meadowcroft got hold of Bell by the head, pulling it back, and fixing his fingers over the sockets of his eyes. The other
prisoner, Baker, was also actively assisting during the assault. Hearing cries of distress and a great disturbance in the closet,
Constables William and Joseph Dean proceeded there and seized Driscoll, who let a half-crown drop from his mouth, and had the other
money in a piece of shirting - he having cut a hole in it large enough for the half-crown to be abstracted. The money was given by
the Deans to Constable William Hair, who handed it over to Mr. Gunn, the Superintendent.
The latter gentleman sealed it up in the presence of Hair, and locked it in his desk. Hair produced the packet, which had not been
opened - he had no doubt of its being the same.
His Honor observed that was not sufficient proof, it would have been desirable had Mr. Gunn attended.
The Solicitor-general observed that Mr. Gunn had given evidence at the time of committal, and was in attendance at the
Court the whole of Saturday, but this morning he (the Solicitor-general) had received a note from that gentleman stating he was unable
to attend from illness.
The prisoners Driscoll and Meadowcroft cross-examined most of the witnesses with great adroitness and tact - their object
seemed to be to convince the court that it was a general row, in which they took no more part than the rest; and that that every
one in the ward knew that the money was dishonestly come by, so that they had each an equal right to take it from the fortunate possessor.
This was entirely disproved, especially by the evidence of George Beal, who originally came to Adelaide, from whence he
came to Launceston. There he got into trouble and was escorted by a constable to the prisoner's barracks in this city. The money
was his own, paid to him by his late master, Mr. Marshall, of Launceston, tailor.
His Honor expressed his regret to see a man who came to these colonies free in such a situation as that in which he now
appeared, and after laying down the law, and pointing out the leading features of the case, left it to the jury, who almost immediately
found a verdict of guilty against all of them.
His Honor, in passing sentence, adverted to their police characters. That of Driscoll presented an awful amount of crime
and consequent punishment.
They were severally sentenced to transportation beyond the seas for the term of their natural lives, with an intimation,
that, if sent to Port Arthur, they would, for a considerable portion of that time, be worked in irons.
Hobart Town Courier
, 27 October 1843. AOTSC 41/5: Meadowcroft and Driscoll were sent to Port Arthur for 6 years and Baker for 5 years.
