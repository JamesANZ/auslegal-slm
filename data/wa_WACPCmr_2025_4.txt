Reasons for Decision
As a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed
all evidence. Only the evidence relevant to deciding this application is
in these reasons for decision.
Requested condition – a qualified roof plumber is to attend, assess the
roof sheet and the installation of the camera and solar
In written evidence to Consumer Protection, the landlord has expressed concern
that the requested minor modification has changed
the integrity of the roof
The tenant has already carried out the minor modification. The tenant supplied
various photos of the roof, which show how the minor
modification was carried
out. The tenant submits they installed the minor modification by removing
existing screws on the roof sheet,
screwing brackets into the roof sheet to add
one security camera and one solar panel, and added two additional seals to the
to prevent water ingress.
The tenant supplied Consumer Protection with a written letter from [redacted]
and [redacted]. [redacted] [redacted] states that the
installation of the
support bracket for the security system will not cause any water issues and when
removed and the roof screws
are reinstalled no water issues should arise. The
letter suggests that the tenant has already complied with the requested
therefore the requested condition is not necessary or reasonable.
The landlord submitted a letter from [redacted]. [redacted] [redacted] states
that when the camera is removed ‘penetrations
will remain, and repairs
will be required’. [redacted] [redacted] states there are three different
levels of repairs that may
be necessary once the minor modification is removed,
ranging from low level repairs (silicone) to high level repairs (full
replacement
of roof sheeting). The [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted]
website homepage suggests there are five different departments
Roof plumbing is not listed
on the Group’s homepage or plumbing page; therefore, this email was not a
particularly relevant
consideration for this ground.
Having regard to all of the evidence before me, the requested condition is not
Requested condition – upon vacating, a roof plumber attend to ensure
that the roof sheet/s are to be returned to the condition
it was, prior to the
camera and solar panels being installed (this may require the affected roof
sheets to be replaced)
The landlord is concerned about water ingress in the eaves and damage to the
roof sheeting from the requested minor modification.
It is a term of every residential tenancy agreement that, unless the landlord
agrees otherwise, when the tenant vacates the tenant
must either:
the minor modification and restore the premises to its original condition,
the landlord the reasonable costs incurred in doing such work.
The landlord is at liberty to pay for someone to inspect the roof when the
residential tenancy agreement ends. If there is any permanent
damage to the roof
at the end of the tenancy, and the landlord can prove that this damage was
caused by the tenant, then there are
appropriate remedies available to the
landlord in the RTA, such as an application for compensation for breach of the
Given that both parties have rights and obligations set out in the RTA which
address the concerns raised by the landlord, the requested
condition is not
necessary. The requested condition is not approved.

Magistrates Court of Western Australia. Appeals must
be lodged within seven days
after receiving this decision, or a later date if leave is granted by the Court.
