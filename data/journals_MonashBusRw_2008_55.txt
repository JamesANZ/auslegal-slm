assesses the role of skills’ development in a shrinking workforce.
Retaining older workers in the workforce is becoming increasingly urgent in the context of ageing populations and skills shortages.
This paper explores the contribution to this objective of skills development opportunities.
There is no single or simple way to encourage older people to keep working, however, providing them with opportunities to update their
existing skills and learn some new skills can contribute as part of a broader strategy that includes changes to public policy to
reduce incentives to retirement and to workplace practices that discourage older workers.
Research shows that older workers do have a capacity to learn and that many benefits flow from providing them with skill development
opportunities for individuals, employers, enterprises and communities.
Knowledge is growing of the most effective forms of skills development for older workers. These build on good practice in teaching
and learning for adults and take account of diversity among older workers in such factors as gender and culture.
Recent Australian research conducted by the Centre for the Economics of Education and Training (CEET) investigated the forms of skill
development most effective for people aged 45 years or older and the implications for effective skills development of some aspects
of the diversity among these people, in their skills, qualifications, workforce experience and employment status.
Seven case studies of training delivery were conducted, with the programs explored being driven and shaped variously by the concerns
and goals of enterprises, individuals, communities and governments. Positive outcomes were identified from all seven programs. The
success of the programs was attributable largely to a combination of the approaches to teaching and learning that were used (i.e.
good practice for adult learners) and organisational factors that included: cooperative arrangements for program development and
delivery; the integration of learning and work; the creation of sympathetic learning environments; and attention to appropriate staffing.
There was substantial diversity among the participants in the programs studied. Where issues arose that were related to aspects of
this diversity, they were addressed primarily by identifying and gaining an understanding of the needs of program participants and
establishing appropriate responses. Responses demonstrated inclusive approaches to program development and delivery, consistent with
good practice in the teaching and learning of adults.
This study drew two major conclusions. First, differences among older workers mean that skills development which supports and encourages
their participation in the workforce should be targeted to the needs and circumstances of specific sub-groups. Variations among older
workers, for example, in skills development and learning needs; preferences, goals and motivations; and work experiences and expectations,
require consideration when framing the types of skills development to be provided and how it is to be delivered. Particular account
needs to be taken of gender-related differences and of the ways in which barriers to employment and participation in education and
training affect different groups of older workers.
Second, appropriate and effective skills development for older workers, in all their diversity, is built on good practices in the
teaching and learning of adults. Some adaptations may be required to programs, activities and other arrangements to meet the needs
of older learners in general and some specific sub-groups and individuals, but where good practices and inclusive approaches are
adopted, these will generally be small.
