Introduction
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
is becoming ever-increasingly
important considering the globalisation of the economy and the extensive import
and export markets
of countries all over the world. It is important that persons
trading across national borders have an understanding of the text and
the CISG as it has become part of domestic law in over 60 countries. Of all the
major trading nations England is the only
country which has not yet ratified the
CIDG or is not in the process of doing so like Japan. It has become so important
CISG has sparked much discussion and debate regarding its provisions.
Upon reviewing the book,
International Sales Law
, collated by Ingeborg
Schwenzer and Christiana Fountoulakis, it is apparent that the objective behind
this text is to provide a comprehensive
explanation of the
, and the current state of
jurisprudence and academic writing. The text achieves its objective. Overall,
this is an excellent text
for a one-stop reference point for all your CISG
CISG in a Nutshell
The text is a convenient reference point for students, early career
researches and professional due to its structure and careful collation
only cases but also academic writings. Schwenzer and Fountoulakis have
segregated the CISG into its respective articles and
provide an analysis of each
article assisted by providing cases law and other published texts. This book has
the same value that
other casebooks have, in that it provides the facts and
decision of various courts and tribunals from all over the world. This is
fantastic utility for students and professional alike who are studying or having
to apply international sales law.
However, it is not just the case summaries that make this book a great study
tool. The other remarkable aspect of this text is the
not only practical, but
also conceptual comparative analysis of the CISG from the point of view of other
domestic laws as well. For
example, under Article 35 of the CISG, lack of
conformity ‘includes discrepancies in quality, quantity, delivery of an
and packaging
Schwenzer and
Fountoulakis then proceed to explain that in many domestic legal systems - by
drawing upon the different distinctions
– regard the lack of conformity in
a different way than it is recognised by the CISG. It is also pointed out that
the difference the outcome is not the same either. Such an
international comparison with domestic law regimes is carried out for
of the articles and provides excellent insight into the differing
characteristics of the CISG.
Schwenzer and Fountoulakis have also included review questions after each
article, to enhance the educational experience of the text.
These questions test
not only the student’s understanding of the CISG, but allow for
independent thought and classroom discussion
and debate.
Importance of the CISG Convention
Schwenzer and Fountoulakis utilise the Convention Debates for very few
articles thus,
the only suggestion for improving the text is
broadening the use of the CISG Convention debates. The Convention debates
provide the
very background to the CISG and its meaning and purpose. The Debates
would assist students’ understanding of why certain academic
exists, such as the one that exists as to recognition of good faith under the
CISG. Providing excerpts from the Convention
debates would provide students with
a context in which to understand and interpret the CISG and possibly develop
individual ideas
with respect to the meaning and or operation of the CISG
specifically considering that the authors work on comparative explanations
within the global system of laws.
This text is an excellent reference point for those delving into the CISG for
the first time. Ingeborg Schwenzer and Christiana Fountoulakis
have made this a
light read; even difficult concepts, such as the requirements for making out a
successful claim under Article 35
of the CISG are made clear and understandable.
International Sales Law
is an ideal study mate for understanding the
