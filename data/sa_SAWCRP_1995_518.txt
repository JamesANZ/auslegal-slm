Compensation
Review Panel
ETTRIDGE AND
TRANSADELAIDE
(00247717/01/08, 01/09, 01/10, 01/11, 01/12 and
Determination of Review Panel made on
26 September 1995
Review Officer
The worker in this matter has lodged several
applications for review which primarily deal with the worker’s dispute as
quantum of weekly payments of income maintenance. Before examining the
applications before me it is necessary to comment on the
history of this
On 15 February 1988 the worker who is employed
as a bus driver, served on his employer a notice of disability and compensation
regarding a back disability. It was noted by the Workers’
Compensation Appeal Tribunal in
Ettridge v State Transport
- Print A84/1995;
[1995] SAWCAT 84
“The worker’s claim was accepted and weekly payments commenced.
He remained incapacitated for work until 20 July 1988
when he was certified fit
for alternate duties. At all material times since then the worker has at least
been partially incapacitated
for work although as I understand he has continued
to work full-time.”
It would appear on the evidence before me that
this history is partly incorrect.
There are at least four periods where
there was a variation in the degree of the worker’s incapacity. These can
be identified
as follows:
9/2/88 to 21/2/88 - Total
2/5/88 (1 day) - Total incapacity
24/6/88 (1 day) - Total
24/7/88 - Total incapacity
On each occasion the worker
had his notional weekly earnings reassessed by the exempt employer as being
differing periods of incapacity.
As to the first period the worker
challenged the amount set by the exempt employer apparently on a number of
grounds. One issue was
the exclusion of overtime in the nature of
“cancelled days off” (CDO’s). The Review Officer made certain
on this aspect but left the calculation of the worker’s
entitlement to the quantum of average weekly earnings to the parties.
review determination went on appeal to the Full Supreme Court in the matter of
Ettridge v State Transport Authority

(1992) 163 LSJS 153
which dismissed the worker’s appeal.
has since ‘campaigned’ vigorously to have this issue re-opened. It
has only been since the decision of His
Honour Deputy President
Cawthorne’s contained in Print A84/1995 that it was uncovered that the
Review Officer had not completed
his statutory duty in setting the quantum. The
original review application No 890101 was remitted to the Review Officer to set
This process has now been completed and I refer to the ex
tempore decision of the Review Officer made on 12 September 1995. The Review
Officer referred to the above periods but determined that the average weekly
earnings should be set only for the first period of
incapacity at the rate of
This is a vital issue and goes to the heart of the matters
before me. Each of the applications relate back to this figure as if it
applicable throughout any subsequent periods of incapacity.
applications before me do not specify any other date of decision. They lacked
the necessary preciseness to reflect that a reviewable
decision are before me in
order to give me jurisdiction. However on the basis that the applications
sought to challenge subsequent
variations to the worker’s payments of
income maintenance, I proceeded to deal with the claims of
‘miscalculations’
on the basis that all review applications relate
someway to the original setting of the average weekly earnings figure.
is now obvious, following the recent decision of the Review Officer, that that
is not the case. Some of the worker’s calculations
relate to the
‘fourth’ figure set by the exempt employer. The worker has never
sought to challenge this figure save
that he would say that he sought to
challenge ‘the lot’.
A further complicating factor is the
impact of the decision of the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Tribunal in
Marina v The Corporation (Remm Constructions Pty Ltd)
[1995] SAWCAT 25.
The impact of this case is set out at page 10
wherein His Honour Judge Cawthorne stated:
“Pursuant to the Act the rate of compensation to which an incapacitated
worker is entitled is fixed by reference to the worker’s
average weekly
earnings. In recognition that average weekly earnings may vary from time to
time, the Act in section 4(9)(a)(i) prescribes
the relevant date from which to
base the calculation as the date of the commencement of the period of the
worker’s incapacity
for work. If the worker ceases to be incapacitated,
but then suffers a further period of incapacity albeit as a result of the
disability, the date from which the calculation is then based is the
date of the further period of incapacity.
If, however, the worker remains
incapacitated throughout, albeit that a settled return to work might mask its
continuance and/or end
the Corporation’s liability to pay income
maintenance, the commencement of the period of incapacity remains the relevant
. Moreover, the fact that the level of incapacity may change, and drift
into periods of total incapacity, does not mean that there
are new periods of
incapacity and thus new relevant dates for the purpose of calculating average
weekly earnings.”
(emphasis added)
If this decision (which is binding on Review
Officers) is correct (and it should be noted that it is the subject of an appeal
Full Supreme Court), the Review Panel and the worker have no choice but
to accept the decision of Review Officer on 12 September
1995. I have explained
this aspect to the worker. He now seeks to challenge the Review Officer’s
It is my view that no useful purpose is brought about by me
entertaining applications for review which lack the necessary clarity
structure to provide me with a reviewable decision. It is one thing to proceed
without regard to technicalities and legal forms
(cf Section 88 of the Act)
however it can only be achieved if both parties to the application know
precisely the dispute before them.
Apart from the worker’s general
dissatisfaction with his average weekly earnings figure he has not been prepared
a structured approach to his applications. I have spent the last half
hour of the last hearing before me attempting to explain the
nature of the
process that must be adopted.
In essence they may be summarized
(1) Dispute as to the setting of his average weekly earnings, either
(a) As set by Review Officer on 12 September 1995
(b) As paid by the exempt employer on 24 July 1988
- This issue will be governed by principles set out in
case. Neither of these decisions have been
reviewed or appealed.
(2) Adjustments of annual leave, long service leave entitlements. This issue
is really a non-issue as the parties are agreed to the
correct method to be
adopted. The only real issue is as to quantum which follows from the settlement
of issue (1).
(3) Adjustments pursuant to section 38. No review has ever been conducted by
the exempt employer nor has the worker ever requested
such a review. There can
therefore be no reviewable decision.
(4) Adjustments pursuant to section 39. Again this matter can be dealt with
only after issue (1) is resolved.
It is my view that there are no
applications for review before me which reflect the above. I hope the worker
will heed such advice
if he is to embark on future
DETERMINATION
Accordingly, pursuant to
section 96 of the Act, I determine that the applications before me do not give
me the necessary detail in
order to be satisfied that there is a reviewable
decision before me and I dismiss all the applications before me.
appeal against this determination must be lodged with the Workers’
Compensation Appeal Tribunal within one month of the
receipt of this
determination. Enquiries about appeals may be directed to the Registrar of the
