of the FPP was refused because it failed to identify and protect a nest
(“the nest”) of the Tasmanian wedge-tailed

appeal contested the refusal. The evidence was as follows.
evidence on behalf of the FPA was that it relied upon management tools including
the Threatened Fauna Advisor (the TFA)
The TFA is an expert decision
support system for threatened species in forestry situations. It is applied
pursuant to Section D3.3
of the Forest Practices Code, which requires that
Forest Practices Officers (FPO) in determining the management of threatened
in wood production areas,
inter alia,
consult the
TFA delivers endorsed management prescriptions (called "recommendations") for
threatened species in forestry situations. Under
the agreed procedures, the
evidence was, forest practices officers will obtain an endorsed management
prescription for the operation

harvesting under a previous plan, eagle nest number 1615 was identified, and the
FPA advised that a reserve should be implemented
around the nest site. An area
of approximately 11 ha was reserved from any further harvesting/development
operations. FPP number
RL 0001 for the clear falling of the existing Forest and
subsequent silviculture in the 11 ha area, was prepared. That is the area
contains the relevant nest.
proposed operation would harvest all of the Forest within the 11 ha area.
Recommendation
3 of the TFA for the wedge-tailed eagle is that there be no forestry activities
within 500m or a 1 kilometre line of
sight during the breeding season, and an
intact reserve area of at least 10 ha around a nest.
above evidence was not contested and the Tribunal finds in accordance with
Tribunal is accordingly satisfied that the proposed FPP is not in accordance
with Recommendation 3 of the TFA, and therefore not
in accordance with agreed
procedures for threatened fauna management. It is therefore not in accordance
with the Forest Practices
Code, and therefore contrary to the Forest Practices
Act. The latter is so with respect to the effect upon this threatened
Section 37(13) of the
Forest Practices Act
1985 the Tribunal is to take
into account the financial effect of its determination on the parties to the
appeal. The relevant financial
effect which on the evidence will be likely to
occur as a result of the present refusal is the loss of a substantial amount of
from the proposed harvesting and subsequent silviculture operations.
The Tribunal was satisfied this will occur as a result of refusal
which is necessary for the protection of the eagle nest.
appellant, if the FPP is refused by the Tribunal for these reasons, has the
opportunity pursuant to the
Nature Conservation Act

Minister for compensation. The Tribunal accordingly does not see the financial
effect of its determination
as justifying approval of the FPP when it should
otherwise be refused.
Conclusion and Decision
Tribunal considers that the refusal appealed against was appropriate having
regard to all the relevant matters. The decision
of the Tribunal is that the
refusal appealed against is upheld.
Tribunal will entertain any application for an order for costs in this appeal,
if made to the Tribunal in writing with supporting
submissions within the next
14 days. If requested the Tribunal will reconvene to hear any evidence in
respect of any matter bearing
on an order for costs.
the absence of any such application for an order for costs the order of the
Tribunal is that each party bears its own costs.
