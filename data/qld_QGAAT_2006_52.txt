REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION
[1] RWM is a 31 year old who lives with his mother, MB, and his step-father, DB.
RWM has had an acquired brain injury since birth.
RWM executed an Enduring Power
of Attorney on 29 November 1996 appointing his mother, his sister, LK, and his
brother-in-law, TK,
as his attorneys for financial matters.
[2] RWM came to the attention of the Office of Adult Guardian because of
concerns that he was not being adequately supervised with
his medication,
resulting in him taking excessive medication and that his finances were being
managed inappropriately. Whether RWM
had capacity to sign the Enduring Power of
Attorney dated 29 November 1996 was also raised as a concern. The Office of
Adult Guardian
carried out an investigation and provided a report to the
Tribunal dated 28 March 2006. It recommended the need for the Public Trustee
be appointed as an independent administrator for RWM but did not consider that
there was a need for a guardian to be appointed.
Issues and the Legislation
[3] The issues for the Tribunal
have capacity for the matter?
Enduring Power of Attorney dated 29 November 1996
Is there a need for a Guardian? if
so, who should be appointed; and
need for an Administrator? if so, who should be
THE PARTIES
[4] RWM attended the hearing with MB, DB, LK (sister), RJ (sister), and Peter
Hooper, MB’s Solicitor who witnessed the Enduring
Power of Attorney dated
29 November 1996. Mr Hooper was present as an observer and did not seek to be a
legal representative of MB.
The Evidence
[5] In addition to the written material contained on the Tribunal file, all of
the parties attending the hearing were given the opportunity
to express their
views. These views where specifically relied upon by the Tribunal, are discussed
LACK CAPACITY FOR THE
[6] The Tribunal had the opportunity to speak to RWM about his understanding of
the reason for the hearing, his life and interests
and the Enduring Power of
Attorney executed on 29 November 1996.
[7] RWM cannot read but can recognise names. He can sign his name by printing
“RWM” but otherwise can only write numbers.
He is very difficult to
understand and has extremely limited verbal communication with mainly
answers. He looks to his mother and
step-father to answer for him. His interests are lollies and playing darts. He
fairly naturally
referred to his wanting his mother to look after his money when
questioned about the Enduring Power of Attorney but he exhibited
a total lack of
understanding of an Enduring Power of Attorney.
[8] Dr Thomas McEniery, a general practitioner, has treated RWM since 1997 and
had last seen him on 25 January 2006. He reported
that RWM had an acquired brain
injury which has been present since birth and that his condition was stable. Dr
McEniery considered
that RWM’s moderate cognitive impairment affected his
ability to manage his financial affairs “extensively” and
was “unable to manage financial affairs”.
[9] Besides the Office of Adult Guardian, who applied for the Tribunal to
appoint The Public Trustee as RWM’s administrator
on the basis that he
lacked capacity, MB applied to be appointed as his guardian and administrator.
DB supported MB’s application.
[10] LK, in a follow-up form to the Tribunal dated 18 April 2006, stated that
“RWM cannot make decisions on his own”
and that “I am
comfortable with the current guardians”. DJ, from RWM’s employer, in
a follow-up form to the Tribunal
dated 18 April 2006, stated that RWM needs
assistance with health care and lifestyle decisions and does not understand
finances and
property decisions.
[11] RJ, in a follow-up form to the Tribunal dated 19 April 2006, stated that
RWM does not make decisions and that MB makes all
[12] It was clear to the Tribunal that RWM lacked capacity to make decisions
were no contrary opinions
voiced by anyone present.
ENDURING POWER OF
[13] The Enduring Power of Attorney was executed on 29 November 1996 appointing
RM, LK and TK as attorneys for financial, personal
[14] Mr Peter Hooper provided a letter to the Tribunal, dated 21 April 2006, in
which he confirmed that he had witnessed the signing
of the document and
indicated that RWM had indicated at the time that he wished his mother and
siblings to be appointed Attorneys
on his behalf. The Tribunal noted that in
witnessing the form Mr Hooper did sign that “the donor appeared to me to
the nature and effect of this power.”
[15] The Tribunal noted, that in his letter Mr Hooper said that “at the
time, capacity for Powers of Attorney was not viewed
with the rigid application
that now applies as a result of the
Guardianship and Administration Act
, and the capacity was not queried in the same manner it now is”.
[16] While Mr Hooper spoke of consulting a Dr Carroll about RWM’s capacity
to execute an Enduring Power of Attorney the Tribunal
noted that Mr Hooper did
not attempt to assert that, at the time, he had satisfied himself that RWM had
the capacity to execute an
Enduring Power of Attorney or set out the basis on
which he may have come to this conclusion.
[17] Having had the opportunity to speak to RWM at the hearing, and on the basis
of the medical evidence which stated that RWM’s
condition was stable and
had existed since birth, the Tribunal formed the view that RWM lacked capacity
to make an Enduring Power
of Attorney on the day of the hearing and would have
lacked capacity to make one on 29 November 1996.
[18] The Tribunal, therefore, concluded that the Enduring Power of Attorney
executed on 29 November 1996 was invalid because RWM
lacked capacity.
[19] The following Enduring Powers of Attorney for RWM are declared invalid
pursuant to Section 113(2) of the
Power of Attorney Act 1998
and Section
84(2) of the
Guardianship and Administration Act
The Enduring Power of
Attorney dated 29 November 1996 appointing RM, LK and TK as attorneys for
financial, personal and health matters.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN?
[20] RWM lives with his mother and his step-father and there is no suggestion
that this is likely to change, although RJ has expressed
an opinion that she
would like to have RWM live with her. Therefore, there is no need for
accommodation decisions in the near future.
[21] RWM’s health care decisions are currently made by his mother and his
step-father and LK and RJ would also be available
as RWM’s Statutory
Health Attorneys if a health care decision was required, so the informal
arrangements are working, making
an appointment for health care decisions
unnecessary. The same can be said for the provision of services for RWM which
would be managed
by his mother and his step-father.
[22] There are no other decisions of a personal nature on the horizon which
would require the appointment of a guardian for RWM.
The Office of Adult
Guardian also did not consider that there was a need for a guardian to be
[23] On the basis that there are no pending decisions of a personal nature
required for RWM, the Tribunal determined that the appointment
of a guardian for
RWM was not required.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATOR?
[24] The Office of Adult Guardian recommended the need for the Public Trustee to
be appointed as an independent administrator for
RWM. MB, supported by DB and
LK, applied to be appointed as RWM’s administrator.
[25] In light of the overwhelming evidence that RWM could not manage his own
financial affairs it was clear that an administrator
needed to be appointed to
manage his affairs for him.
[26] The Tribunal concluded that an administrator should be appointed to manage
RWM’s financial affairs.
IF SO WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED?
[27] The Tribunal had to consider the application from MB for her appointment as
administrator for RWM, or it could appoint the Public
Trustee of Queensland as
administrator to manage RWM’s financial affairs. In deciding who was the
most appropriate administrator
for RWM the Tribunal had the assistance of a
report from the Office of Adult Guardian which recommended the need for the
Public Trustee
to be appointed as an independent administrator for RWM.
[28] RWM receives a fortnightly Centrelink Disability Support Pension of $528.55
and a mobility allowance of $71.40. He also receives
wages ranging between $30
and $90 per fortnight. These funds are credited to his Bank account in the name
of MB as trustee for RWM.
[29] MB charges RWM $200 per fortnight board and lodgings and claimed his
personal spending was $175 per fortnight, comprising purchases
of CDs, DVDs,
clothing, chips and soft drinks. RWM also spends approximately $50.00 per
fortnight on taxi vouchers to and from his
[30] On this basis, RWM should have savings each fortnight of approximately $160
being the difference between his income and his
expenditure. However, his bank
statement of 31 January 2006 showed a balance of only $1.20.
[31] MB advised the Office of Adult Guardian that she uses an ATM card to access
the funds from RWM’s account. RWM cannot use
an ATM card. The bank
statements provided to the Tribunal showed regular withdrawals of $340 each
fortnight as well as other withdrawals
which resulted in minimal balances
shortly after each deposit.
[32] MB advised the Office of Adult Guardian that she had been told by
Centrelink staff on a number of occasions that RWM could not
have any savings
over $1,000 or his pension would be decreased. MB said that as a result of this
advice, she has maintained a minimal
balance in his account. MB advised that she
had recently purchased a television, portable DVD player, stereo, video
recorder, mattress,
and furniture for RWM.
[33] MB advised the Tribunal that since 3 months ago, when the Office of Adult
Guardian became involved, she has been able to save
[34] The Office of Adult Guardian concluded that
withdrawals from the bank account seem to indicate that RWM’s pension is
as part of the family income and used accordingly, not necessarily for
RWM’s sole benefit. Because the Adult Guardian was
satisfied that
RWM’s finances were not being used for his sole benefit it concluded that
the allegation of inappropriate
management was substantiated.
[35] RWM and DB and MB live in a Queensland Housing Commission rented house. The
rent has recently increased from $200 per fortnight
to $323 a fortnight. Just
before Christmas 2005 RWM’s name was put on the lease.
[36] LK was supportive of MB’s application and said that now that her mum
had given her word, books would be kept. RJ, however,
thought that the Public
Trust might be best and that they might build up RWM’s money quicker.
[37] MB told the Tribunal that she had no experience in bookkeeping but DB had
done the books for canteens for Navy establishments.
MB was unsure as to whether
or not she was RWM’s Centrelink nominee.
[38] Peter Hooper made the comment that all of this has been a “wake-up
call” to MB.
[39] While it was clear from the evidence that MB plays a significant role in
RWM’s life and that he looks to her for assistance
with his finances, the
report from the Office of Adult Guardian raised some serious
[40] The Tribunal concluded that it was necessary that a pattern of saving be
established for RWM so that he had funds available
to meet expenditure in the
future. DB and MB are on pensions and because of their age could not be expected
to look after him for
the rest of his life.
[41] Given the conclusions of the Office of Adult Guardian, the Tribunal decided
that it would be appropriate for an independent
administrator to be appointed
for RWM so that systems could be put in place to ensure a saving regime could be
established for RWM.
The Tribunal decided that the appointment of the Public
Trustee for one year would enable this to occur and that MB could then apply
appointment as RWM’s administrator when, if appointed, she would be able
to continue with the established regime.
[42] The Tribunal considered that, in the period of the Public Trustee’s
appointment, MB should be given as much opportunity
as is appropriate to manage
RWM’s day-to-day financial affairs.
