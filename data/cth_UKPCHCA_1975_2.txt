1975, March 12; May 6. 6:5:1975
Lord Wilberforce delivered the judgment of their Lordships as follows:-
The petitioner has sought special leave to appeal in forma pauperis to Her
Australia dated 22nd August 1974. By that judgment the
Full Court dismissed an
appeal by the petitioner against a judgment of the High Court of Australia
(Mason J.) in its original jurisdiction
dated 4th December 1973. (at p232)
2. A preliminary objection to the competence of the petitioner to present the
petition was taken on behalf of the respondent, the
Commonwealth of Australia,
and argument was heard by their Lordships on this objection without entering,
at that stage, upon the
merits of the petition. (at p232)
3. The objection was founded upon the
Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals)
, an enactment of the Parliament of the Commonwealth
of Australia.
This Act was reserved for Her Majesty's pleasure, and was assented
June 1968. The Queen's assent was made
known by proclamation of the
Governor-General on 30th July 1968 which appeared
in the "Commonwealth of
Australia Gazette" of 6th
August 1968. (at p232)
4. Section 3 of the said Act is as follows:
"(1) Special leave of appeal to Her Majesty in Council from
a decision of the High Court may be asked only in a matter in
which the decision of the High Court was a decision that -
(a) was given on appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court
of a State given otherwise than in the exercise of federal
(b) did not involve the application or interpretation of -
Constitution
(ii) a law made by the Parliament;
(iii) an instrument (including an ordinance, rule, regulation
or by-law) made under a law made by the Parliament.
(2) The last preceding sub-section does not apply in respect
of a decision of the High Court given in a proceeding that was
commenced in a court before the commencement of this Act." (at p232)
5. It is clear, in their Lordships' opinion, that the petitioner is prevented
from seeking special leave of appeal by the terms
of this section. The
proposed appeal is from a decision of the High Court which, itself, was not
given on appeal from a decision
of the Supreme Court of a State. Since, in
order for a petition for special leave to be admissible, the requirements of
(a) and (b) must be satisfied, and since that of par. (a) is
clearly not satisfied, the section, unless its validity can be attacked,
conclusive. (at p233)
6. It was contended for the petitioner that
of the said Act was not
validly enacted, in accordance with the
Constitution
of Australia, and this
contention must now be examined. The relevant section of the
Constitution
which is as follows:
"No appeal shall be permitted to the Queen in Council from a
decision of the High Court upon any question, howsoever
arising, as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of
the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to
the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of any two or
more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the
question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in
The High Court may so certify if satisfied that for any special
reason the certificate should be granted, and thereupon an
appeal shall lie to Her Majesty in Council on the question
without further leave.
Except as provided in this section, this
Constitution
impair any right which the Queen may be pleased to exercise by
virtue of Her Royal prerogative to grant special leave of appeal
from the High Court to Her Majesty in Council. The
Parliament may make laws limiting the matters in which such leave
may be asked, but proposed laws containing any such limitation
shall be reserved by the Governor-General for Her Majesty's
pleasure." (at p233)
7. The relevant part of this section is the last sentence, and it is no doubt
under this sentence that the Act of 1968 was purportedly
passed. The main
argument for the petitioner was based upon the word "limiting", the contention
being that this word did not extend
to authorize complete abolition of the
right to seek special leave of appeal from the High Court and that the Act of
1968 did amount
to such complete abolition. Their Lordships cannot accept this
argument. Whether or not the words "limiting" and "limitation" are
in the restricted sense contended for, the Act of 1968 does not amount to a
complete abolition of the right to seek special
leave of appeal from the High
Court. Under
(ii) the High Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from
the Supreme Court of any
State or from any other Court of any State from
which, at the establishment of the Commonwealth, an appeal lay to the Queen in
Appeals from the High Court in such matters
unless they involve the
exercise of federal jurisdiction are untouched by the Act of
1968: the Act is
therefore a "limitation" in
the narrowest sense of the word. (at p234)
8. A second argument was based upon the use of the word "matters" in the last
sentence of
, the suggestion being that any limitation
must be by subject
matter, which must be specified in the limiting enactment and which
one of the matters mentioned in
. In their Lordships' opinion
however, the word "matters" which also appears in
(relating to
the original
necessary it may be, in view of the terms
application of "matters" in those sections, their Lordships have no doubt that
a general construction must be applied
to the word. This appears to
conform with the view of the High Court expressed in a number
of decisions.

must be given to it in

For these reasons their Lordships, on the hearing of the preliminary
objection, ruled that the petition was incompetent and decided
