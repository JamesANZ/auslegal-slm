REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
The residents of the Bribie Pines Island Village as listed in attachment A to
the application filed 11 September 2008 (“the
respondents”) seek an
order that Palmpoint Pty Ltd (“the applicant”) disclose copies of
all its financial documents
for the years ending 30 June 2005, 30 June 2006, 30
June 2007 and 30 June 2008.
applicant is the park owner of the Bribie Pines Island Village (“the
are 270 manufactured home sites located at the park and the home owners occupy
the sites pursuant to site agreements. Most of
the site agreements contain
provisions for an annual CPI site review rental increase and a market review
increase every three years.
There are 96 site agreements that contain a
provision for an annual CPI increase only and do not contain a three yearly
market review
On 29 July 2008 the applicant served notices on the 96 homeowners advising of a
site rent increase based on a market review pursuant
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks Act) 2003
Act”). Many of these home owners responded saying they did not accept the
proposed increase, and others did
not provide a written response indicating
whether or not they agreed with the proposed increase within the time required
71(4) of the Act.
applicant seeks an order that the increase be approved, and in its application
set out the facts it relies on in support of the
matters raised in section 70(3)
of the MHRP Act and pleads:
“(a) as determined by the registered valuer, the
increased site rents will still be below the range of site rents usually charged
for comparable residential parks;
(b) the increase in the site rent is not substantial;
(c) the site rent is adjusted annually in accordance with the CPI and the
park owner is seeking a market review under section 71 of
(d) the CPI increase in the year 30 March to 2008 is 4.8%;
(e) the amenity of the home park and the standard of the common areas has
been completely revamped;
(f) no communal facilities or services have been withdrawn;
(g) there are 14 new residents paying $133.50 for outside sites and 24
(paying) $130.50 for inside sites, which further evidences
the current market
rents for sites in the park;
(h) the proposed increase is fair and equitable in all the circumstances and
will maintain site rent parity in the home park.
The site rent increase sought in the section 71 notices
should be approved because site rents need to be kept in line with actual
rents and market increases must be done on a regular basis to ensure that the
rents do not fall too far behind the market
rate. The Consumer Price Index is
not an accurate measure of costs and rents in the park and a long period in
which rent reviews
are based only on the Consumer Price Index is likely to
result in a significant differential between the resulting site rents and
market rents.”
respondents in their defences have denied that the applicant is entitled to the
market review increase.
Relevant Legislation

Respondents’ Submissions
respondents submitted that they are entitled to disclosure of the financial
accounts for the years ending June 2005 to June 2008
and for part of the year
May 2009. The basis upon which they seek
these orders is stated in their submissions, as follows:
The applicant in his statement on page 2 states:
applicant believes the increase is reasonable and not excessive” he also
goes on to say on the same page “the
market rent review is affordable in
all circumstances considering the relativity of the increase in site rents as a
comparison to
the increases in the average earnings of workers over several
industry groups over the past three years and the increases in the
pension and
rent assistance rebates over the past three years”. This is a typical
example of the attempts by the applicant
to be judge and jury in all matters.
The financial accounts will very well show why it is affordable to the company,
Palmpoint Pty
Ltd, not to be granted the increase and that the applicant has a
very substantial net income without such increase. The financial
accounts would
be further proof that the increase asked for is motivated by greed.
The applicant states on page 3
, “all capital gain from resales goes
to the resident the park owner makes no profit from resales.” There is a
substantial
commission, fee or whatever it is called which is charged to the
In his conclusion the applicant states “the purpose of the site rent
increase was to increase the site rents applicable in the
park to market rates
to ensure the park remains viable to operate and to enable the applicant to
continue to be able to provide all
residents including the respondents with a
place to live in pleasant surroundings”. To my mind this is an insult to
the intelligence
of the Tribunal and the production of the financial accounts as
requested will show this without any doubt. Also in the conclusion
applicant goes on “it will be difficult for the applicant or any other
park owner to maintain the current standard of facilities
and services offered
by the park if it cannot adjust rents to market rates and market rents continue
to be capped.” The financial
accounts will again show the truth of the
matter and in any case it will be interesting to ask of the applicant as to what
and services are being referred to.
The applicant also requests the production of costings in relation to the new
administration building. They say:
“It is submitted that this building
has not been of any advantage to this village, in fact the service and
facilities have,
in relation to administration, dropped significantly. The
hours have been slashed in which we can ask for service even to the extent
management wanting us to make appointments. The walking distance for residents
has increased substantially, and remember these
are old people, some of whom
cannot walk without the use of physical aids. There was an admin building
already in the village, and
this was adequate for use by the residents of this
village. In addition this so called new admin building also serves as a home
for the husband and wife management team and also for Mr Forrester when he is
present. Should these matters be taken into consideration
then the cost
declared is very overstated and in fact as far as this village is concerned the
amount should not even be considered.
Palmpoint Pty Ltd alleges in its
statement that the admin building costs in excess of $550,000.
The applicant also asks that any contract between the applicant and Mr
O’Donnell be produced. The reason being that:
“his letter
attached to the applicant’s submission has been unduly influenced by the
relationship between him and the
applicant. I do not believe that Mr
O’Donnell is an independent person and is in fact an employee of the
applicant or under
a great degree of control by the applicant. The fact that he
might not be on the payroll is not conclusive that he is not an employee,
might be done for taxation purposes or other reasons.”
Applicant’s Submissions
applicant submits that it has not sought to increase the rental pursuant to
for reasons related to the applicant’s financial circumstances
and profitability. The purpose of the site rent increase was
to increase site
rents applicable to the park to market rates to ensure that the park and the
applicant’s business is keeping
pace with the market. The applicant
submitted that smaller periodic rental increases over time are manageable by
comparison to a
situation where no increase might occur for a long period of
time and then the need arises for a substantial increase.
submits that even if the applicant’s profitability were a relevant factor
to take into account, the financial circumstances
do not address all matters
that are relevant to the long term viability of the park. To continue to
operate as a business the park
must show a return on investments so that future
capital expenditure funded by borrowings can be justified.
Observations and Findings
Tribunal does have power pursuant to section 50(b) of the CCT Act to require a
party to the proceeding to give to the Tribunal
any document in the
party’s possession or control that may be relevant to the proceeding.
Thus the first enquiry is to determine
whether the financial records and the
other documents sought from the applicant are relevant to the issues raised in
the proceeding.
applicant is seeking a market review rental increase pursuant to
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act
and the grounds for the
increase are set out in its application. The applicant has referred to section
70(3) of the MHRP Act and
listed the factors that it considers are relevant.
The applicant relies on the market rent that is payable as the main factor and
have not pleaded the increase in costs as a factor to be relied on. The market
rent is the rent that persons are prepared to pay
for a manufactured home site
at the park. As the costs of running the park are not listed as a relevant
factor in determining whether
a rental increase should be allowed, the financial
returns of the company are not relevant to the proceeding. The same reasoning
applies with respect to the costs of the new administration building and the
contract documents that are requested. The financial
and other documents are
not relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings.
am not satisfied that the documents requested are relevant to the issues raised
in the proceeding. I also get the impression the
respondents are fishing for
documents that they hope may exist and may be relevant. They are requesting
copies of all financial
documents with out precisely considering what these
documents are and how they may be relevant. If the respondents were to list the
documents they are seeking, there position may have been stronger.
these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the respondent is entitled to
disclosure of the documents being sought.
application for disclosure of the financial and other documents is dismissed.
