Legislation
Consideration
Family tax benefit: shared care; care period
McMANUS and SECRETARY TO THE DSS
Decided: 10th April 2014 by N. Isenberg
McManus and Pretorious were separated and the care of their two children was
determined by Family Court Orders dated 8 July 2010.
The orders were very
detailed and the care arrangements were worked out over a two year period. The
alternate years gave McManus
more care. McManus lodged a claim for family tax
benefit (FTB) for the period 8 January 2012 to 13 January 2013. His salary after
January 2013 precluded him from FTB. Centrelink rejected his claim because he
had 27 per cent care of the children; when it was reassessed
he had 29 per care
(still below the required 35 per cent for FTB). McManus appealed the rejection
on the basis that this was an alternate
year and the actual care of the children
was at least 35 per cent. Pretorius did not agree with the proposed change.
The main issues were whether there was a change in the pattern of care, and
if so, the start and end date of the care period.
Legislation
A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999
provides that if care for a child during a care period is less than 35 per cent,
the child is taken not to be a child of that individual
for FTB purposes for any
part of the period. Where the pattern of care shows that parents share
qualification for FTB for a child,
then the decision-maker is required to
determine the appropriate shared care percentages.
Section 35P
states that a care percentage must be revoked if a
new percentage of care is determined under
, and the new percentage
would be in a different range as set out in the provision.
Section 35Q
also provides discretion to revoke a care percentage.
Section 35B
states the percentage is determined on the basis of the actual
care the person has or will have over the care period. The term 'care
as having the meaning given by
(2)(b) of the
does not specify when a care period starts and
for how long it continues.
Consideration
Pretorious argued that there was no change in the care, and that the court
or-ders were being followed as they had been in the previous
year. Pretorious
stated that if there was a change in care it was when the youngest child started
school on 27 January 2012. McManus
conceded if that date was used he would have
less than 35 per cent care. He had used the dated 8 January 2012 because he had
children for the second part of the school holidays.
Family Assistance Guide
(the ‘Policy') has provisions for
determining the actual percentage of care and the care period. Instruction
2.1.1.45. These
provisions are especially important where carers do not agree as
to the pattern of care.
Instruction 2.1.1.50 of the Policy relevantly states as follows: Step 1 -
Establish the pattern of care The pattern of care to be
used in the shared care
determination is either the pattern agreed to by all carers of the child or, if
there is no such agreement,
the pattern of care as established by the FAO
decision maker for the assessment period. Depending on the care arrangements for
child, there may be more than one as-sessment period in an income
Instruction 1.1.C.100 of the Policy relevantly states as follows:
1.1.C.100 CARE PERIOD FOR FTB ASSESSMENTS
The term 'care period' is used in relation to assessing shared care for the
purposes of FTB. The care period for working out the percentage
of care provided
by an adult: • begins on the day on which the care of a child starts to be
shared between 2 or more adults,
or the day on which the pattern of care
(2.1.1.45) changes, and • ends when there is a subsequent change in
Explanation
A care period of 12 months from the commencement of the care ar-rangements
will generally be used where the care arrangements are
ongoing. The same care
arrangements will be assumed to apply for subsequent 12 month periods, unless
otherwise advised. If there
is no agreed ongoing pattern of care and the care
arrangements only apply to a period shorter than 12 months, a one-off shorter
period may be determined. Centrelink argued that it was misleading to
calculate the care period every 12 months and that it was more
accurate to use
the two year cycle, or, if there was to be a change in care percentages it
should be at the milestone changes, like
the commencement of school for the
younger child.
Centrelink argued that there was no reason to go against the policy
guidelines and referred the AAT to the case of
Gillson and Secretary,
Department of Families, Housing, Community Services & Indigenous Affairs
[2011] AATA 73
where the Tribunal stated that it is appropriate to have
regard to the Policy in contested cases of shared care. The AAT found that
concerned the tensions between the formula for entitlement to FTB
on the basis of ‘hours in care’, rather than on the
‘nights in care’ as set out in the Policy. However, in
the AAT accepted that in some cases it may be appropriate to assess care
arrangements differently than anticipated by the Policy.
The AAT found there was nothing inconsistent with the Policy if it found that
the care arrangements changed on 8 January 2012 and
that it was unreasonable for
Centrelink to use the 2 year cycle.
The AAT set aside the SSAT decision and found that McManus was entitled to
FTB for the period 8 January 2012 to 7 January 2013 because
he had 35 per cent
care of the children during that period.
