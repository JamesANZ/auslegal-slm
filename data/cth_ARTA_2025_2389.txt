Statement of Reasons
(the Applicant) seeks review of a decision to reject an 18 July 2023 claim for
child care subsidy (CCS) for her daughter (born
27 November 2021) and to grant
CCS in relation to her later 20 May 2024 clam from 13 May 2024 and not earlier.
At issue is the earliest
date from which Ms WBLN can be paid CCS in
relation to her daughter.
had previously been in receipt of CCS and family tax benefit (FTB) at various
times in relation to her two sons on the basis
that she was single.
27 August 2021, Ms WBLN made a claim for Parental Leave Pay in relation to
the expected birth of her daughter on 30 November
In this claim, Ms WBLN
advised that she had been a member of a couple with her partner from 20 January
issued letters to Ms WBLN on 5 April 2022, 1 June 2022,
25 November 2022 and 24 May 2023 stating that her partner’s
had not been confirmed for the 2020/2021 financial year and that her CCS
entitlement could not be assessed until his income had been
confirmed by lodging
a tax return or advising that a tax return was not required to be lodged. The
letters further set out the advising
time frames for that to be done.
11 July 2023 and 17 July 2023, Centrelink wrote to the Applicant advising that
her CCS had been cancelled because she was no longer
eligible for CCS for her
sons from 11 July 2022 because they had not attended a childcare service in the
prior 26 weeks. The letters
further stated that a claim for CCS would need to be
lodged if they started using child care again.
18 July 2023, Ms WBLN lodged a claim for FTB and CCS providing details of
her two sons and her daughter.
27 July 2023 and 19 August 2023, Centrelink emailed Ms WBLN advising that
they were working on her claim, that she didn’t
need to do anything and
that she could track the progress of her claim by logging into her Centrelink
account or app.
16 October 2023, Centrelink decided to reject the Applicant’
claim. This decision was not notified to Ms WBLN.
24 October 2023, Centrelink again wrote to the Applicant advising that her CCS
had been cancelled because she was longer eligible
for CCS for her sons from 11
July 2022 because they had not attended a childcare service in the prior 26
weeks. The letters further
stated that a claim for CCS would need to be lodged
if they started using child care again.
first learned that her 18 July 2023 claim had been rejected when she attended a
Centrelink branch in May 2024. She lodged
a further claim on 20 May
On 22 May 2024, CCS
was granted from 13 May 2024 pursuant to the 20 May 2024 claim.
22 May 2024, the Applicant requested a review of the decision to grant CCS from
13 May 2024 and not earlier and, on 5 June 2024,
a Centrelink authorised
review officer affirmed the decision.
28 August 2024, following an application for first review lodged on 5 June 2024,
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT)
in its then Social Security and
Child Support Division (SSCSD), affirmed what was identified as the two
decisions to 1) reject Ms
July 2023 claim for CCS for her
daughter and 2) to grant the 20 May 2024 claim from 13 May 2024 and not
24 September 2024, Ms WBLN lodged an application with the AAT seeking
second review of the decision of the SSCSD.
14 October 2024, the AAT became the Administrative Review Tribunal (the
Tribunal). Under the transitional provisions in the
Administrative Review
Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No.
1) Act 2024
proceedings in the AAT that were not finalised before 14 October 2024
are taken to be continued and finalised by the Tribunal. Anything
relation to the proceeding before 14 October 2024 is taken to have been done by
the Tribunal.

As recognised by the Federal Court in
MDXJ v Secretary, Department of Social
[2020] FCA 1767:
The part which a
governmental policy should ordinarily play in the determinations of the Tribunal
is a matter for the Tribunal to
determine, in the context of the particular
case, informed by considerations of the desirability of consistency of
administrative
decisions, but balanced against the ideal of justice in the
individual case (
Hneidi v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
(2010) 182 FCR 115
). Further, it is well-established that the
Tribunal must make the correct or preferable decision in each case on the
material before
it and that the Tribunal is at liberty to adopt whatever policy
it chooses, or no policy at all, in fulfilling its statutory function
Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No 2)
(1979) 2 ALD 634

The important
matter is compliance with the terms of the relevant statute itself

acknowledge that
in the absence of statutory
indication to the contrary, any lawful executive policy enacted to guide the
exercise of a statutory power
is a relevant factor for me to take into account
in performing the review task. A lawful approach allows the adoption of
appropriate
policy as a guide but not so as to control the making of the
are two separate decisions that arise for consideration given
Ms WBLN’s submissions. As already canvassed those decisions
the decision to reject Ms WBLN’s 18 July 2023 claim and 2) the
decision to grant the 20 May 2024 claim from 13 May 2024
Respondent’s position is that the decision to reject the
18 July 2023 claim was correct because Ms WBLN’s
2020/2021 income tax return had not been lodged by the due date
and, further, as a result, there was no recent reasonable estimates
an assessment could be based.
Further, the Respondent’s position is that the first date CCS could be
granted from in relation to Ms WBLN’s 20 May 2024
13 May 2024 and not earlier.
CONSIDERATION
position includes that her 18 July 2023 claim for CCS for her daughter should be
accepted on the basis that Centrelink
should have relied upon the previous
estimates of family income that she had provided. In written submissions dated
20 December 2024,
Ms WBLN’s submissions include that:
(a) She has regularly provided family income estimates: on 1 July 2021, 4
May 2022, 1 July 2022, 4 July 2022, 1 July 2023 and 13
as per screenshots provided from her myGov.
(b) She questions why her estimates are not able to be accepted in relation to
her claim for CCS for her daughter lodged on 18 July
2023 as is permitted by
section 67DB.
(c) No request for income was requested after her 18 July 2023 claim was
(d) It would have been reasonable for Centrelink to use and rely upon her family
income estimate in order to process the 18 July
2023 claim.
(e) She did not receive notice of the decision to reject her 18 July 2023 claim.
hearing Ms WBLN’s evidence included that she has been receiving
subsidies in relation to her children for 15 years and thought
she had a good
understanding of what was required and she made every effort to ensure that
estimates of income were given to Centrelink
on time to ensure that everything
was accurate. She applied for CCS for her daughter, which she believed she was
eligible for, and
patiently waited to receive an assessment and never received
it – there was no communication. In the meantime, she kept updating
records and was then surprised to later learn that an assessment had been made,
rejecting her claim, for which she received no
notification or correspondence.
If she was eligible to receive CCS, she should receive it and it should be
backdated because she
never received an outcome for her claim.
said that her understanding was that Centrelink worked off estimates and
corrections would be made once the paperwork was
lodged and income was verified;
with either an overpayment or underpayment resulting. That is why she kept
everything up to date.
Further Ms WBLN stated that all the correspondence
she had previously received was in relation to her sons and she did not
that to also apply if she lodged a new claim in relation to her
daughter. Ms WBLN said she found it harsh and penalising to receive
determination or outcome for her application in July 2023 until almost a year
later when she made enquiries to find out the claim
had been rejected. She has
missed out on potentially thousands of dollars from not being notified of the
Respondent’s position as regards rejection of the 18 July 2023 claim for
CCS, is that Mrs WBLN’s partner’s tax
return for the 2020/2021
income year was lodged on 7 May 2024, outside the deadline within which an
individual and, if relevant,
their partner’s tax return, must be lodged to
satisfy CCS reconciliation conditions. Reconciliation is required to correctly
determine a person’s entitlement to CCS, with reconciliation requiring
confirmation of a person’s and their partner’s
taxable income
(section 67CD of the Administration Act). There were no special circumstances
that prevented satisfaction of the reconciliation
conditions within the required
time, including because a number of notices were sent to Mrs WBLN about the need
to confirm previous
years’ income and alerting Mrs WBLN to the deadlines.
Those notices were deemed to received by her. The Respondent further
Ms WBLN’s 17 July 2023 claim in any event provided no estimate of
income for her partner and stated his income estimate
agreed she had received notices via myGov as contended by the Respondent but
said they were in relation to her sons. She did
not ever receive any
communication that assessment for her daughter required confirmation of income.
She said at the time she received,
for example the 25 November 2022 letter,
stating that her partner’s income needed to be confirmed, it was
irrelevant because
she had not yet made an application for CCS for her daughter
because she was not yet in any kind of childcare. She queried why an
estimate of
her partner’s income could not be relied upon based upon his previous tax
returns. She stated that she did not
receive any communication, after her claim
of 18 July 2023, that tax returns needed to be lodged. Instead, she
received continual
emails saying that Centrelink was working on her claim and
she did not need do anything. The Respondent’s position in response
that Ms WBLN had already been notified of the requirement for her
partner’s income to be confirmed by lodging tax returns
for the 2020/2021
year and had chosen not to do so. In this regard the Respondent noted that
Ms WBLN’s evidence on first review
included that she did not press
the issue of lodgment of her partner’s tax returns earlier because she
knew their income was
too high and because the two older children were no longer
attending day care or after school care. Ms WBLN said that she became
of changed income limits for CCS, and her daughter had then started attending
day care, and that is why she lodged a claim
on 18 July 2023. If she had been
informed in a timely fashion of the issue with her partner’s tax return
after 18 July 2023,
they would have been in a position to rectify this
and lodge a further claim earlier than 20 May 2024.
Respondent’s position, further, is that the earliest date that a claim can
be granted is the first Monday of a CCS fortnight
that is not more than 28 days
before the claim was made, such that the earliest date that the 20 May 2024
claim can be granted is
the first Monday of the CCS fortnight prior to 20 May
2024 (when all requirements were met), that is from 13 May
Ms WBLN’s 18 July 2023 claim
67CB(1) of the Administration Act provides that an individual is only entitled
to be paid CCS if a determination to that
effect has been made. However,
subsection 67CB(4) of the Administration Act further provides that an individual
who is entitled to
be paid CCS:
(a) ceases to be entitled to be paid that CCS, and is taken never to have been
entitled to be paid that CCS, if the individual has
not met the CCS
reconciliation conditions, for the income year in which the CCS fortnight that
includes the week starts, by the first
deadline for the income year; and
(b) cannot again become entitled to be paid that CCS before the individual meets
the CCS reconciliation conditions for the income
67CC of the Administration Act provides that if an effective claim has been made
for CCS, a determination must be made as
to whether the requirements in
subparagraph 85BA(1)(a)(i) to (iv) of the Act are met and if not, the
individual is not eligible for
67CD(2) of the Administration Act provides that a determination must be made
that an individual is entitled to be paid
CCS, and the amount they are entitled
to be paid, if certain requirements are satisfied. The requirements include,
pursuant to subsection
67CD(2)(b), that the individual meets the
information requirements in subsection 67CD(10) of the Administration Act
which includes
the following requirement in paragraph (d):
(d) if a determination was made for the individual under section 67CD for a week
in a previous income year and the first deadline
for the previous income year
has passed—the individual has met the CCS reconciliation conditions for
that previous income year.
determination had been made for Ms WBLN in relation to previous income
years, including the 2020/2021 income
As to whether Ms WBLN
met the CCS reconciliation conditions for that previous income year, the CCS
reconciliation conditions are
set out in section 103A of the Administration Act.
When a person is required to lodge a tax return, the CCS reconciliation
are met once the Commissioner of Taxation has made an assessment of
the taxable income of the person for the relevant income year,
that is the
person, and their partner, if relevant, have both lodged their tax returns.
103B and 103C of the Administration Act set out the deadlines for meeting the
CCS reconciliation conditions as being:
(a) the end of the first income year after the relevant income year (the
first deadline
) unless a longer period is allowed if satisfied
that special circumstances prevented the individual meeting the CCS
reconciliation
conditions for the relevant income year before the end of the
first income year; and
(b) the end of the second year after the relevant income year (the
) unless a longer period is allowed if satisfied that special
circumstances prevented the individual meeting the CCS reconciliation
for the relevant income year before the end of the second income year.
provisions are noted in section 6.4.4.10 of the Guide which also recognises that
an individual needs to meet reconciliation
conditions for all income years in
which CCS was determined before they are able to make a new effective claim for

advising of the need

letters included the following:

67DB(2)(a) of the Administration Act provides that if an individual has not met
the CCS reconciliation conditions at the
time of making a determination under
section 67CD, a determination may be made on the basis of a reasonable estimate
given by the
individual.
of 18 July 2023, the Commissioner of Taxation had not made an assessment of the
taxable income of Ms WBLN’s partner for the
2020/2021 income year. It
is not in dispute that this did not occur until 7 May 2024. Ms WBLN’s
evidence before me was that
she was notified that they needed to lodge tax
returns, but she thought it was irrelevant to her because there was no
application
in process – she believed their combined income was too high
(and the boys were no longer attending any kind of childcare).
The subsequent
18 July 2023 claim was because new income tests came into play and her
daughter was then attending childcare. Further,
Ms WBLN submitted that she
was not advised of the implications of not confirming the 2020/2021 income as
regards the claim for CCS
for her daughter.
can be seen from the letters in evidence and Ms WBLN’s evidence that she
was advised of the requirement to lodge her partner’s
tax returns and
chose not to do so on the basis that it was irrelevant to her at the time.
Ms WBLN contends that she was not notified
of the implication for the claim
for CCS for her daughter and that the previous letters had been about CCS for
her sons. Notably,
however, both the letters of 25 November 2022 and
24 May 2023, after noting that family income is not confirmed for the
income year, go on to state that Ms WBLN is only able to submit a
new claim for CCS after family income is confirmed. No reference
is made to such
limitation only been in relation to her sons or in relation to previous CCS
entitlements only.
essence, Ms WBLN was not aware of the effect of the legislation in her
circumstances and has made an assumption that the requirement
2020/2021 family income was not relevant to her, contrary to what is actually
stated in the letters from Centrelink. As
has been found in a number of previous
analogous cases, lack of awareness of the law does not constitute special
circumstances nor
is there an obligation for Centrelink to provide clients with
information as to their entitlements or to correct their errors. (

am not satisfied that special circumstances existed that prevented lodgment of
Ms WBLN’s partner’s tax return before
either of the deadlines.
The reconciliation conditions were not met in relation to the 2020/2021 income
year for the purposes of
the 18 July 2023 claim.
regards whether a determination could alternatively be made on the basis of a
reasonable estimate given by Ms WBLN, Ms WBLN submits
regularly provided family income estimates, on 1 July 2021, 4 May 2022, 1 July
2022, 1 July 2023 and 13 May2024 as per screenshots
provided from her myGov
account. Centrelink submits that there was no reasonable recent estimated
provided by Ms WBLN. It was submitted
that as at 18 July 2023,
Ms WBLN’s partner’s income tax return for 2020/2021 had not
been lodged and it could not be
said that a reasonable estimate had been given
by Ms WBLN in those circumstances.
submissions on behalf of the Respondent included that estimates cannot be relied
upon indefinitely and that is why the legislation
makes it clear that there
needs to be confirmation of income, by lodgment of tax returns, within two years
of the relevant income
myGov screenshots provided by Ms WBLN,
and Centrelink’s
show that Ms WBLN
provided 2 income estimates for the 2021/2022 income year, an estimate of
$121,000 on 1 July 2021 and an estimate
of $271,000 on 4 May 2022.
Ms WBLN’s and her partner’s combined actual income for the
2021/2022 was $394,286.
satisfied in those circumstances that a reasonable estimate had been provided by
follows that I am not satisfied that information requirements in
subsection 67CD(10) of the Administration Act were met in relation
Ms WBLN’s 18 July 2023 claim such that a determination could be made
that Ms WBLN was entitled to CCS. Ms WBLN’s
July 2023 claim therefore could not be
Ms WBLN’s 20 May 2024 claim
is not in dispute that by the time of Ms WBLN’s 20 May 2024 claim,
the reconciliation conditions for the previous years in
which there had been a
determination for CCS for Ms WBLN, including relevantly the 2020/2021
income year, had been met, with the
Commissioner of Taxation having made an
assessment of the taxable income of Ms WBLN’s partner on 7 May
2024 such that a determination
could be made pursuant to subsection 67CC(1)(a)
of the Administration Act in relation to the 20 May 20224 claim.
issue, is the earliest date upon which CCS could be granted to Ms WBLN.
Further Ms WBLN submitted that consideration should be
given to the fact
that had she known about the 18 July 2023 claim rejection earlier, she would
have arranged for satisfaction of
the reconciliation conditions and lodgment of
a further claim much earlier than 20 May 2024. She then would not have
lost her entitlement
to thousands of dollars of CCS in relation to her
67CC(4)(a) provides as follows in relation to the date of effect of a
determination made under subsection 67CC(1)(a):
(4) A determination made under paragraph (1)(a):
(a) takes effect on the day specified in the determination, which must be the
first day for which the Secretary is satisfied that
the requirements in
subparagraphs 85BA(1)(a)(i) to (iv) of the Family Assistance Act are met
that is also:
(i) the first Monday of a CCS fortnight; and
(ii) not more than 28 days before the day the claim was made; and
May 2024 was the first Monday of a CCS fortnight after the reconciliation
conditions were met on 7 May 2024. That is therefore
the first day upon which
Ms WBLN could be granted CCS pursuant to the 20 May 2024 claim. There is no
discretion in the legislation
for the Ms WBLN’s circumstances to be
taken into account such that CCS can be paid from an earlier date.
have found that Ms WBLN’s 18 July 2023 claim could not be granted. I
have also found that the earliest date from which CCS
could be granted in
relation to Ms WBLN’s 20 May 2024 claim is 13 May 2024. It
follows that the decision under review is affirmed.
reaching this decision, I acknowledge Ms WBLN’s understandable
concern that she was not notified of the 16 October 2023 rejection
her 18 July 2023 claim and that had she been duly notified, she could have and
would have arranged for her partner’s 2020/2021
tax return to be lodged
earlier and for a new claim for CCS to be lodged earlier than
20 May 2024. However, the legislation does
not permit these matters to
be taken into account either as regards rejection of the 18 July 2023 claim nor
as regards the earliest
date from which CCS could be granted pursuant to the 20
May 2024 claim. The failure by Centrelink to notify Ms WBLN of the
of her 18 July 2023 claim is a matter going to Centrelink’s
internal processes and obligations and is not a matter that the
legislation
enables me to take into account. Ms WBLN is at liberty to follow up
Centrelink in relation to concerns about that failure,

make a complaint given in the authorised review officer’s
