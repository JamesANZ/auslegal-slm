PROCEEDING IN THE ABSENCE OF THE COMPLAINANT
correspondence, dated 11 May 2007, the Tribunal informed all of the parties
that the matter had been listed for a directions hearing
at 10.00 am on
15 June 2007, in Court 22, Level 5, the Brisbane Magistrates
Court, situated at the corner of George and Turbot Streets,
correspondence also informed the parties that the hearing had been listed
because the Complainant's complaint has not been finalised
in accordance with
the provisions of the Act.
the matter came before the Tribunal, the Complainant did not appear. I directed
that her name be called three times in the precincts
of the Court. There was no
appearance following the calling of her name.
addition to the correspondence already noted above, the Tribunal itself had,
prior to the hearing, made the following attempts
to contact the
Complainant:
15 December 2005, a member of the Tribunal staff called the contact mobile
telephone number provided by the Complainant ("the
number") only to find that
that number had been disconnected;
correspondence dated 15 December 2005 directed to the Complainant at her
address for service (as provided by solicitors who
had previously acted for
her), the Tribunal informed the Complainant that the Registry had been trying to
number provided had been disconnected- a request was
made for the Complainant to contact the Tribunal Registry urgently on the number
provided to advise her intentions with respect to her complaint.
Complainant has not responded to any of the attempts made by the Tribunal to
to remain in contact with the
am satisfied, as a result of the matters summarised above, that the Complainant
was aware that the matter would come before the
Tribunal, for directions at
10.00 am on 15 June 2007.
the circumstances, I determined to conduct the directions hearing and hear any
submissions as to the future conduct of the matter
in the absence of the

noted above, by correspondence dated 15 December 2005, the Tribunal wrote
to the Complainant requesting that she provide new contact
details because the
only telephone number provided to the Tribunal for its use in contacting her had
been disconnected.
Tribunal has received no response in respect of this request by the
Complainant.
has been no further action in respect of this complaint since the actions of the
Tribunal as noted above which occurred on 15
RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE
the history of this matter as outlined and the matters referred to above, I find
that the failure of the Complainant on a continuing
basis to attempt to
prosecute her complaint in any meaningful way, when considered in conjunction
with her failure to appear at the
hearing today and her failure to maintain
to satisfy me "that for any other reason the complaint should not be
further considered"
and consequently I dismissed the complaint.
Mr Teherne,
who appeared on behalf of the First and Second Respondents, sought that the
Complainant pay their costs of the matter
on the Magistrates Court scale (said
by him to be current as at 2003) in the total sum of $2,960.00.
Tribunal may order a party to pay such costs as the Tribunal considers
reasonable.
deciding whether to order a party to pay costs, the Tribunal may have regard to
the matters particularised in s.213(3) of the
Mr Treherne sought costs as assessed on the Magistrates' Court scale, s.213(2)
provides as follows:
"However, costs must be assessed
using the Scale of Costs for the District Court under the
Uniform Civil
Procedure Rules
unless the Tribunal is satisfied that, because of the
complexity of the matter, or because of another reason, costs should be assessed
using a higher scale."
matters to which the Tribunal may have regard in determining whether to order a
party to pay costs are enumerated in s.213(3)
. I am not persuaded
that the reasons for the enactment of the
as stated in the preamble would be
compromised or defeated if the Complainant was ordered to pay the costs of the
First and Second
Respondents in the circumstances outlined above.
I am concerned that a party such as the complainant who acts on her own behalf
may not have fully understood the potential
consequences for her in the event
that a costs order was made at the Directions hearing. Further, in so far as it
is relevant, I
have had regard to
N v State of Queensland & Anor
considered all of the matters outlined above, in the exercise of my discretion,
I make no order as to costs.

– whilst the Court was concerned with s.202 of the Act, the
phrase “without reasonable excuse” is common to both
