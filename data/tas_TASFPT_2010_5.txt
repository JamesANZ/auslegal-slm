T and V Payne v Forest Practices Authority [2010] TASFPT 5 (11 May 2010)
File No: 1/10 F D5/2010
T and V Payne Appellants
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was the hearing of an appeal for FPP – RSS0008 at
“Ringrove” 1434 Earlham Road, Rheban.
The appeal was heard at
Hobart on 7

and Ms A Chuter appeared on behalf of the Forest Practices Authority.

is an appeal by Timothy and Valerie Payne against the refusal by the Forest
Practices Authority of Forest Practices Plan 0008
for clear felling and
conversion to plantation of 159ha of native forest and partial harvesting of
19ha of native forest.
area of that Forest Practices Plan is part of the “
property of approximately 2000ha about 16 kilometres south of Orford. In
February 2007 the Appellants prepared a Redevelopment Plan
in respect of
the entire property. In that Plan the property was described and dealt with as
nine Management Units. No 3 was Earlham
Hills foothills and Forest
Practices Plan RSS006 submitted in respect of it. The Forest Practices
Authority refused to certify that
Plan and this Tribunal on
23 February 2010 dismissed an appeal against that refusal; upon the
grounds that the Plan involved clearance
of threatened forest communities
Eucalyptus globulus
Eucalyptus ovata
threatened species Swift Parrot.
Practices Plan RSS0008 was in respect of Management Unit No 8 Cockle Bay
and Boot Bay and was refused upon the grounds:
approximately 5ha of threatened forest community
Callitris rhomboidea
excluded from clearing and conversion operation, and
areas of potential foraging and breeding habitat for Swift Parrot should not be
only material before the Tribunal is the proof of evidence prepared by
Shaun Thurstans, Swift Parrot Project Officer, Threatened
Species Section
DPIPWE and Anne Chuter, Ecologist, Forest Practices Authority. That proof of
evidence establishes that each ground
of refusal was obedient to Tasmanian
policy and legislation.
is no escape for the Tribunal from those grounds of refusal.
Appellants foresaw this conclusion and by letter dated 3 February 2010
“The rejected plan (RSS0008) proposed the development to plantation of
159 hectares, the selective logging of 19 hectares, and
reservation of 228 hectares, making a total of 406 hectares, occupying
20% of Ringrove’s total area of approximately 2000
At a previous hearing of the Forest Practices Tribunal on the 14 December
2009 with regard to Forest Practices Plan RSS 0006 (Earlham
Hill), I provided
the following information from the planning document
Ringrove: Redevelopment
with regard to the 800 hectares of Ringrove adjacent to the
Mercury Passage shoreline (which includes the area of FPP Plan RS0008
discussion here). I said the
intention is to retain this whole area as
reserve. Although it contains significant stands of marketable timber, and
offers country
ideal for plantation development post harvesting, these
marketable values are outweighed by the value of it being an extraordinary
diversity of environments that together forms part of a unique and largely
untouched landscape. In terms of its vegetation, the
unique characteristics
include a stand of mature blue gums over natural grassland that extend the whole
length of the coastline,
a significant patch of oyster bay pines inland from the
coast that are of great stocking density, and a patch of remnant rain forest
that includes sassafras and manferns. Even patches of cutting grass and baurea
scrub occur within it.
Rare birds that occur in the area include both sea eagles and wedge tail
eagles and swift parrots.
It would be feasible to combine heritage and environmental values and
forest exploitation by careful logging of the area, but in doing
natural beauty of the area would be spoiled. The separate heritage values of
the components containing endangered flora
and fauna would not in any way match
the value of the area protected as a whole. It is the view of the owners that
material values
of timber locked up in preserving this country could more than
be balanced by offsets in the other areas set aside for plantation
development.
It is unfortunate for us as planners of our property development that the
Earlham Hill (Forest Practices Paln RS0006) was rejected,
because, as the
sentence ending this quote above states, we propose to accept as an offset to
the plantation in RS0006 that the Boot
Bay proposed here (FPP RS 0008) be
retained as a conservation area without cost to the community. This intention
was conveyed to
the Forest Practices Authority prior to the submission of both
Now, however, and in view of the fact that our appeal against the Forest
Practices Authority’s advice was unsuccessful with
regard to FPP RS 0006,
it is encumbent upon me to take this step to maximize the commercial value of
for my family, particularly as the combined areas of FPP RS0006
and FPP RS0008 of 826 hectares 41% of the total farm area. It is
inequitable in my view that one family should relinquish nearly half the income
potential from a not insubstantial property to underwrite
community initiatives
in the protection of endangered species and environments.
I would not argue at length for the Tribunal to reverse the recommendation of
the Forest Practices Authority because we were unsuccessful
in that with regard
to the adjoining FPP, and, in our view, the conservation values of this Boot Bay
area (FPP RS0008) are markedly
greater than for the Earlham Hill area (FPP
RS0006). Our intention here is to make clear, that where before we would
provide this
area as an offset, the rejection of all development persuades us to
seek compensation in both cases, including the relevant area
here within FPP RS
with Tasmanian legislation and policy the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal
against the Forest Practices Authority refusal
to certify the Plan 00078.
However, we note the Appellants’ statement and contentions from Mr
Payne’s letter 3 February
2010; and support any negotiated solution
including the development of offset proposals – perhaps as the Appellants
had proposed
- and note any application which they may make for compensation
