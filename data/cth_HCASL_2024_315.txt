IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY UNCLE ROBBIE THORPE FOR
SPECIAL LEAVE TO APPEAL
[2024] HCASL 315
applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of
the Supreme Court of Victoria
(McLeish JA), which refused the applicant's application for a direction to
a Registrar to accept documents
for filing.
applicant's proposed grounds of appeal have no prospects of success.
It would therefore be futile to grant the extension of time
leave to appeal refused.
