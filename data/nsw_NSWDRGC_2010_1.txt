1 Mr Kyle Bruce is an applicant to undertake a
Drug Court Program. He has been charged with 17 offences, including 15 break and
offences of various descriptions, 12 of which were committed in
circumstances of aggravation. The circumstance of aggravation alleged
such matters is that the offence was committed in the company of another
2 Mr Bruce indicated a plea of guilty to all 17 matters in the
Local Court when Mr Bruce sought access to a Drug Court opportunity,
matters were then adjourned to the Drug Court. He has confirmed those guilty
pleas before the Drug Court, which has now recorded
convictions. Mr Bruce is 19
years old, and, whilst he has a juvenile record, has never been dealt with as an
adult. He has extensive
family support, and otherwise appears to be a likely
candidate for a Drug Court program.
3 Mr Bruce has been extraordinarily
co-operative with the prosecuting police. The facts sheet reveals that Mr Bruce
was spoken to
be detectives about an incident at Robbie Crescent, Carlingford
when he reported on bail in relation to matters number 1 and 2 on
the Drug Court
list. Mr Bruce then told detectives that he wished to participate in
an investigative drive about interview regarding a number of offences
he had committed...during this drive about interview the accused
admitted to
committing the following offences
”. The facts sheet then provides
details of 15 new matters, including the Robbie Crescent offence, which is at
the heart of
4 An issue has been raised by the Crown as to his
eligibility for a Drug Court program. Eligibility for a Drug Court program is
Drug Court Act 1998
Section 5(2)(b)
that a person is not an eligible person if the person is “
an offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault.”
The issue arises because matter number 8 on the Drug Court list is the Robbie
Crescent, Carlingford offence, and involves an aspect
of violence (to use a
neutral term).
5 Matter number 8 is a charge arising under
Crimes Act 1900
; a matter of break, enter and steal, committed “
circumstances of aggravation, to wit, he was in company with another person,
namely unknown person
”. The facts tendered, and to which the offender
has pleaded guilty, are:
“...the accused admitted breaking into number 16 Robbie Crescent in
Carlingford in the company of two other unknown males. They
broke into this
house by kicking in the front door and once in the house unplugged and moved a
computer before stealing the victim’s
car keys and motorbike keys. The
accused tackled the victim to the ground in an attempt to flee from the house.
The victim suffered
pain from being knocked to the ground. None of the property
has been recovered.”
6 Ms Broomfield
for the Crown firstly responded to the
The Queen v De
[1981] HCA 31
(1981) 147 CLR 383)
which the Court had suggested was an issue to be
explored at this hearing. I am grateful for the submissions made. I agree with
Crown that the inclusion within the accepted facts of conduct in this case,
which reveals an additional matter of aggravation, does
not breach the
principle, as Mr Bruce is not exposed to a higher penalty.
(unrep, 30/5/94, NSWCCA)
(unrep, 9/7/97,
7 The substantive issue is however the question of eligibility,
given the treatment of the home owner by Mr Bruce when he broke into
Crescent address. Ms Broomfield sensibly perhaps relies on the decision of
[2005] NSWDRGC 1
a decision of mine in 2005. Mr Flood, for Mr
Bruce, has to argue that either
was wrong, or that this case can be
distinguished from
raised an interesting
issue, as Mr E faced a charge which sounds alarming, that is, a charge of
“wielding a knife in a public
place”, an offence under
Summary Offences Act 1988
As was discussed in
that case, the offence could be established without anyone of reasonable
firmness even being present, as
“No person of
reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the
The legislation also provides an opportunity for an accused to
establish a reasonable excuse, and/or the statutory defence of “lawful
authority” under
9 On this vexed question as to whether a
person has been charged with an offence involving violent conduct, in
I sought to summarise the case law to that point:
“In the matter of
Chandler v The Director of Public Prosecutors
[2000] NSWCA 125
Justice Hodgson, Chief Judge in Equity, gave the leading
opinion. Justice Hodgson referred to the second reading speech for the
which was given in the Legislative Assembly on 27 October
1998, and that second reading speech included the following statement;
“The Drug Court programme will deal
only with offenders who commit certain categories of offences. These offences
will be mainly
non-violent theft offences. Those offenders who commit sexual
offences and offences involving violent conduct will not be eligible.
of offences that will be included are break, enter and steal, fraud and forgery
offences, offences involving stealing from
a person or unarmed robberies,
provided there is no violence, possession and use of prohibited drugs, or
dealing in quantities of
prohibited drugs below the indictable
At paragraph 37 his Honour said;
“...in my opinion, the use of the word
‘charged’ in
Section 5(2)
points very strongly to it being the
elements of the charge which are significant, not the particular conduct. That
view was expressed
in an earlier decision of Judge Murrell, Senior Judge of the
Drug Court in
R v Rance [1999] NSW Dg Ct 2.”
Justice Hodgson also referred to dictionary definitions of violence and
violence and said;
“40. Without
quoting them, I think it is fair to say that relevantly the dictionary
definition suggests that violence generally
refers to the application of rough,
strong, physical force.”
Justice Hodgson also agreed with Judge Murrell in
should be construed quite strictly, as it removes a benefit which would
otherwise accrue to an offender.
The next relevant authority is the
matter of the
Director of Public Prosecutors v Allan Ebsworth and
[2001] NSWCCA 318.
In that matter Justice Meagher gave the leading
opinion. The case of
concerned a man who was charged with
robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. Mr Justice Meagher agreed with
what Chief Judge
Hodgson had said in Chandler in relation to an elements test,
and went on to say;
“19. I agree with
that construction of the section. In my view, this Court should follow what was
said in Chandler in this connection.
20. In the present case, if
one looks at the charge, it is implicit as I have said from the verb, to rob and
the accusation of an
offensive weapon, that violence was necessarily involved.
Those two elements together constitute violent conduct.”
Support for this interpretation is found in the decision of the Victorian
Supreme Court in R v Butcher
[1986] VicRp 4
[1986] VR 43
when that Court stated, “if
threats are made personally to intimidate or seeking to intimidate this is also
in our opinion
violence.... both putting a person in fear or seeking to put a
person in fear of being ‘subjected to force’ has always
accepted under the common law as violence sufficient to render a contemporaneous
larceny a robbery.”
And continuing from paragraph 24;
“24. Accordingly, the charge of armed
robbery armed with an offensive weapon, in reference to the elements of the
charge, constitutes
behaviour involving violent conduct.
if that test is wrong, and if it were necessary to consider the particular
conduct of the offender, the first opponent’s
behaviour in this case
necessarily constitutes violent conduct.
26. For the reasons given
above, threatening to use violence in the form of brandishing a baseball bat is
sufficient to constitute
violent conduct.”
So essentially the situation is that the decision in
and again approves the decision of the Drug Court in
10 It should also be
noted that Mason ACJ agreed with Meagher JA in
If one confines oneself to the criminal pleading as distinct from the
facts the Crown expects to prove in this case, this was in my
offence involving violent conduct...That is because a necessary element of the
offence of the robbery charged will
be proof of the use of threat of

authority from
elements test.
however I went on to rely on what Mr
Justice Meagher said (at paragraph 25 quoted above) about considering the
particular conduct
of the offender, given the alternate elements of the charge
against Mr E of “wielding a knife in a public place”, and
at the particular conduct of Mr E. In Mr E’s case, the elements of the
offence charged
reveal whether there was violent conduct or
not, yet on the face of it, the offence of
“wielding a knife in a
public place”
appears to be an offence which is aimed at providing
community safety from possibly very concerning or dangerous behaviour. So an
offence committed against that section could have been one which involved no
conduct which could be considered violent conduct, or,
as with Mr E’s
factual circumstances, included significant violent conduct.
Bruce’s case is quite different. There is no doubt that the elements of
the offence with which he has been charged, that
is, break enter and steal,
committed in the aggravating circumstance of being in company, is not an offence
in which there is any
element of violent conduct (except perhaps towards the
broken door, and Parliament specifically expected the Drug Court to deal with
matters of break, enter and steal). This is a fundamentally different situation
14 As Mr Flood has pointed out, the prosecution has not charged
Mr Bruce with the offence of break, enter and steal with the circumstance
aggravation being the use of corporal violence on the home owner (or with a
separate charge of assaulting the home owner for that
matter). What is before
the Drug Court is a charge which has no elements of violent conduct within it,
but a facts sheet which discloses
an alternate charge, or an additional
15 Whilst any utilisation of
does not arise in this case, I do note that if Mr Bruce
charged with common assault, it is likely that the court would have been
prepared to deal with such a matter by utilizing
Drug Court Act
by sitting temporarily as an ordinary Local Court, and then dealing with that
assault charge in a way which did not prevent
Mr Bruce having the opportunity of
a Drug Court Program. See
[2005] NSWDRGC 2.
a procedure regularly undertaken by the Drug Court if there are separate
offences involving violent conduct in the low
range of objective gravity –
for example, an offender may be charged with a string of dishonesty offences,
and with resisting
the Police Officers or assaulting a Loss Prevention Officer
at the time of his arrest. Clearly, the last mentioned matters are charges
involving violent conduct, but are not of such seriousness as to prevent the
offender being regarded as an eligible and appropriate
candidate for a Drug
Court program. Utilizing the ordinary jurisdiction of the Local Court, this
court might defer finalising the
matters involving minor violent conduct by
imposing a conditional bond under
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure)
, or by sentencing the offender to a term of imprisonment which has
already been served whilst on remand. I have only raised this
issue of the use
to draw attention to the fact that it may have been to Mr Bruce’s
to have been charged with an additional offence of common
17 Ms Broomfield has also raised the Crown’s concerns that
to find Mr Bruce to be an eligible person may open the floodgates,
undesirable offenders gain access to the program. I cannot agree. One would and
can expect that if an offender commits crimes
which involve significant or
concerning violence, then they will be charged with offences with elements which
reflect that violence.
The charges thereby laid will render the person
ineligible.
18 Accordingly, for the reasons above, I am of the view that
Mr Bruce is an eligible person.
