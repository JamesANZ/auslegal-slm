CORAM: GRANT CJ
EDITED REASONS FOR DECISION
August 2025)
[1] The accused
is charged with aggravated assault alleged to have been committed against the
complainant on 10 October 2023, and
sexual intercourse without consent,
aggravated assault and choking in a domestic relationship alleged to have been
committed against
the same complainant on 28 October 2023.
[2] The Crown
case may be summarised briefly as follows. The accused and the complainant were
in an intimate partner relationship
at the material time. There was a domestic
violence order in force which named the complainant as the protected person and
the accused from assaulting her.
October 2023, the accused became intoxicated, verbally abused the complainant
and accused the complainant of sleeping with
other men. He then ripped off the
complainant’s underwear and punched her three times in the groin. The
accused then threatened
to stab the complainant with a stick and struck her to
the head with a rock. That conduct constituted the aggravated assault offence
charged in count 1.
October 2023, the accused again became intoxicated, verbally abused the
complainant and accused the complainant of sleeping
with other men. During that
abuse the accused began punching and kicking the complainant. The accused then
forcibly removed all the
complainant’s clothing, pulled her to the ground
and beat her with a stick. While on top of the complainant the accused forcibly
inserted a finger or fingers into her vagina two or more times. That penetration
constituted the rape offence charged in count 3.
The accused then stabbed the
complainant with a stick to the back, buttocks and chin, attempted to force the
stick into the complainant’s
mouth and bit her on the forearm. That
conduct, together with the physical violence which preceded the alleged rape,
constituted
the aggravated assault offence charged in count 2. The accused then
placed his hands around the complainant’s throat and strangled
sufficient pressure to interfere with her breathing. That conduct constituted
the choking offence charged in count 4.
[5] The Crown
has served two notices advising of its intention to adduce tendency evidence.
[6] The first
notice is dated 1 August 2025 and relates only to the charged conduct. The Crown
contention is that the evidence in
relation to each charged incident is mutually
admissible to prove a tendency on the part of the accused to engage in physical
towards the complainant; to engage in sexual or sexualised violence
towards the complainant; and/or to have a jealous, controlling
and violent
disposition towards the complainant. Those tendencies are said to relate to the
issue of whether the accused committed
the acts charged.
[7] The defence
does not object to the mutual admissibility of the evidence for that purpose,
subject to one important qualification.
That is, the defence accepts that the
offences with a sexual component, being counts 1 and 3, are mutually admissible
for tendency
purposes, and that the offences of frank violence, being counts 2
and 4, are mutually admissible for tendency purposes, but not otherwise.
[8] The second
tendency notice is dated 7 August 2025 and relates to both the conduct charged
in counts 1, 2 and 4, being the aggravated
assault and choking offences, and six
assaults which the accused committed on his former intimate partner between 24
July 2017 and
19 January 2021. The Crown contention is that the evidence of each
incident is admissible to prove a tendency on the part of the
accused to engage
in physical violence against female intimate partners; to improvise weapons to
use against female intimate partners
during assaults; and/or to have a
controlling and violent disposition towards female intimate partners. Again,
those tendencies are
said to relate to the issue of whether the accused
committed the acts charged.
[9] The defence
takes objection to the admissibility of the evidence of the six assaults which
the accused committed on his former
intimate partner. The evidence sought to be
adduced for that purpose is particularised in the second tendency notice.
questions of proof, those previous incidents may be summarised as
follows in ascending chronological order:
(a) on 24 July 2017, the accused became intoxicated and struck the victim on the
back of the head twice with a toy truck causing
swelling and bruising, in
circumstances where a domestic violence order was in place naming the victim as
the protected person;
(b) on 28 September 2018, the accused became intoxicated and struck the victim
in the head with a saucepan, placed his hands around
the victim’s neck and
choked her, ripped the victim’s clothing in the course of attempting to
prevent her from escaping,
struck the victim on the back with a broomstick and
punched the victim in the head;
(c) on 10 July 2019, the accused became intoxicated, threatened to hurt the
victim and then punched the victim to the chest, in circumstances
domestic violence order was in place naming the victim as the protected
(d) on 5 December 2019, the accused became intoxicated, started arguing with the
victim about jealousy issues, struck her in the
head and neck with a bicycle,
punched the victim twice to the neck and then dragged the victim along the
ground, in circumstances
where a domestic violence order was in place naming the
victim as the protected person;
(e) on 18 November 2020, the accused verbally abused the victim and threatened
to stab her with a pair of scissors he was holding;
(f) on 19 January 2021, the accused became intoxicated and struck the victim
with a table causing her to fall to the ground, got
on top of the victim and
choked her, and stabbed the victim in the shoulder and lower leg with a pair of
[10] There is no
doubt or dispute concerning the principles which govern the admissibility of
tendency evidence. They are now well-settled.
The first question is the extent
to which the evidence is capable of supporting the tendency asserted. The second
question is the
extent to which the tendency, if capable of support, would make
more likely the facts said to constitute the charged offences. In
those questions, the court must take into account the cogency of the evidence
relating to the relevant conduct, the strength
of the inference that can be
drawn from the evidence concerning tendency, and the extent to which that
tendency increases the likelihood
that the fact in issue occurred.
[11] If the
evidence satisfies those criteria, there is a further requirement that it cannot
be used against an accused unless its
probative value outweighs any prejudicial
effect. For these purposes, the ‘probative value’ of evidence is
mean ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect
the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact
[12] Turning
then to the assessment of the strength of the tendency inference, the number and
frequency of the incidents sought to
be relied upon by the Crown is sufficient
to establish that the accused has behaved in a violent manner towards his
previous intimate
partner and the complainant. Having regard to the number and
nature of the previous incidents, when taken together with the conduct
any temporal gaps between them are not sufficient to sustain the conclusion that
these were isolated aberrations or otherwise
not reflective of a relevant
tendency on the part of the accused. That is particularly so given that both the
period of the accused’s
relationship with the former partner, and the
interregnum between the end of that relationship and the date of this alleged
were punctuated by regular and sometimes lengthy periods of
incarceration. The incidents are also not so remote in time from the
circumstances of the offences charged as to significantly undermine their
probative value in permitting an inference of tendency
to be drawn.
[13] The conduct
in question is general in the sense that it is said to demonstrate a tendency on
the part of the accused to engage
in physically violent behaviour towards his
intimate partners and to have a violent disposition towards his intimate
partners. On
the other hand, certain aspects of the conduct are relatively
specific in the sense that they variously involve either intoxication,
component in the form of jealousy and/or and the use of everyday objects as
weapons. Proof of those incidents is no doubt
sufficient to demonstrate a
tendency on the part of the accused to act in a particular way or to have a
particular state of mind.
Those tendencies are to engage in frank violence
including the use of improvised weapons and to harbour a violent disposition
his intimate partners.
[14] I turn then
to consider whether those tendencies, if found to be established by the jury,
would make more likely the facts said
to constitute the charged offences. At
the risk of doing a disservice to the carefully crafted submissions of both the
the defence, the competing contentions can be broadly summarised as
[15] The Crown
says that it is unnecessary to establish that the violence deployed on each
occasion was identical, or even of the
same type. It is only necessary to
demonstrate that the accused uses violence against his intimate partners in
similar circumstances.
It would be artificial to construct any rigid delineation
between violent offending and sexual offending in these circumstances.
because assault, domestic strangulation and rape are all offences of violence at
base, and a tendency to engage in verbal
and physical violence so as to exercise
control is clearly relevant to establishing whether the accused exercised
physical dominion
in these circumstances as alleged, and whether the sexual
penetration alleged was consensual: see
Pseudonym) v R
[2023] VSCA 269
[16] Conversely,
the defence says that general tendencies in relation to violence and violent
disposition cannot assist the jury in
determining whether the accused engaged in
sexualised violence or sexual intercourse without consent. The evaluation of
value is directed to the capacity of the tendency evidence to bear on
the probability that the accused engaged in the conduct charged.
calculus, a tendency to engage in non-sexual violence does not and cannot assist
the jury in determining whether the accused
has committed sexual offences. The
defence also submits that it is not possible to quarantine the evidence of the
prior convictions
to proof only of the violent offences charged. Any direction
to the jury designed to limit the use of the evidence for tendency purposes
the violent offences charged would be ineffective to preclude rank propensity
reasoning and/or would be so confusing as to give
rise to unfair prejudice.
assessment, while on one level the rape charge falls into a different category
of offending to the other three charges,
and while the tendencies asserted by
the Crown in the second notice do not have a sexual component, that is not such
as to fatally
diminish the probative value of the tendency evidence sought to be
adduced in the circumstances of this case. It is well accepted
that as a general
proposition there does not need to be a specific conformity between the
incidents relied on for the tendency inference,
either between themselves or
with the conduct constituting the offence charged. With the exception of
tendency evidence which is
adduced to establish identity, evidence is not
deprived of its character as tendency evidence only because the inference sought
be drawn from the prior behaviour does not conform precisely with the conduct
[18] In the
circumstances of this case, it is not meaningfully possible to disentangle the
two charges alleging violent conduct on
28 October 2023 from the rape charge.
All were committed as part of the same episode or transaction and occurred
either simultaneously
or in quick succession. All were highly violent in nature.
The digital penetration as it is described in the Crown case and the
complainant’s
evidence was an act of violence and the exercise of physical
dominion rather than a sexual act. The accused’s conduct in that
was not directed to his own sexual gratification. It was sexual conduct only in
the sense that it involved a violent interference
with the complainant’s
genitalia. Its defining characteristics were violence and degradation. The same
may be said of the conduct
charged in count 1.
[19] If one adds
to the other evidence in the Crown case the fact that the accused has displayed
a tendency in similar circumstances
to respond with drunken violence towards his
previous intimate partner, including by the use of improvised weapons, any
that the complainant has fabricated her account of violence with a
sexual component motivated by jealousy, or is somehow mistaken
in that respect,
might be assessed by a jury as unreasonably improbable.
[20] As well as
satisfying the second threshold requirement for admissibility, that affords the
evidence a relatively high degree
of probative value. Ranged against that, the
evidence is not of such a character as to provoke some irrational, emotional or
response in the jury or cause the jury to give it more weight than it
deserves. Any concern in that respect can be adequately addressed
orthodox directions in relation to the use of evidence for a tendency
[21] The rulings
on the preliminary issues
evidence identified in the Crown’s tendency notice dated 1 August
2025 is mutually admissible for tendency purposes.
evidence identified in the Crown’s tendency notice dated 7 August
2025 is admissible for tendency
