KEY WORDS Floor Coverings, Penalty, Evidence
The application for the imposition of a civil penalty is dismissed.
The Application
By an application lodged with the registry
on 5 March 2001 the Owners Strata Plan 58649 ("the applicant") sought the
imposition of
a penalty on Ms Tran ("the respondent") for failing to comply with
a notice to comply.
The Hearing
At the first hearing Ms Reed of BCS Strata Management Pty Limited ("BCS")
conducted the matter. Ms Tran appeared in person. At the
second hearing Ms
Dalag also of BCS appeared for the applicant. Mr Robinson, solicitor
represented Ms Tran.
The Applicant's Evidence
The evidence of the applicant was in summary as follows:
BCS was appointed strata
managing agent pursuant to a written agreement dated 10 April 2000. Ms D
Richards of that office held a
delegation to affix the seal of owners
corporations managed by BCS and attest to the fact and date of
At the executive
committee meeting of the owners corporation on 13 September 2000 a resolution
was passed in the following terms:
"Resolved that Body Corporate Services be authorised to issue a Notice to
comply to the owners of unit 9 who installed tiles on the
unit floor without
written permission from the owners Corporation which is causing noise and
disturbance to the other residents in
the building."
A letter was sent by BCS
to Ms Tran on 14 September 2000 requesting compliance with by-law
A notice to comply dated

extent sufficient to prevent transmission of noise from
the floor space likely
to distract with the peaceful enjoyment of the owner or occupier of another
Letters had been
received from Ms G Willis of lot 15 dated 28 December 1999 and 16 February 2000
complaining about noise emanating
from lot 9 including loud music, loud parties,

A letter of Mr A Hunt,
chairman of the owners corporation of 18 June 2001 noted that a resolution had
been made at an extraordinary
general meeting that the owners corporation were
not willing to pay the full costs of a sound test, but were prepared to meet
the costs if Ms Tran was prepared to meet the other

Evidence was given on behalf of the owners corporation by Ms J Poddebsky of
unit 2. Her evidence was in summary as follows:
owner/occupier of lot 2 in the scheme. Lot 2 is located, for the most part
under lot 9.
Ms Tran removed the
carpet from part of her lot, replacing it with hard tiles some 18 months ago.
The tiles contribute to the passage
of noise from lot 9 to lot 2. The sound
transmitted from the tiles is very different from the sound transmitted through
floors in the kitchen.
A diary kept by her
notes noise events in the more recent past between October 2000 and March 2001
including noise on tiled floor,
dragging noises, sounds like galloping, tap
dancing on floor, stomping shoes, steel balls dropping over and over and
furniture being
dragged across the floor.
The additional noise has
had a significant effect on her use and enjoyment of the lot, it can be enough
to wake her up, she has had
difficulty sleeping, suffered migraines, slept in
other room, used ear plugs and raise the level of music played in her
A medical report from
her general practitioner, Dr G Horton noted that she had been suffering
increasing frequency of migraines, and
that she has reported her neighbour
upstairs is noisy and wakes her on a regular basis. This contributes to her
migraines and stress.
She obtained a quotation
from acoustical engineers to conduct sound
Ms Tran's offer to carry
out informal testing was refused by the owners corporation on the basis that
such testing was not objective.
A tape recording of
noise heard in her flat was played.
Respondent's Evidence
Ms Tran's evidence was in summary as follows:
The carpet in the living
area of the lot was replaced with tiles in early 2000. It was replaced as it
was affecting her allergies.
It is a one bedroom apartment and she has her bed
and a rug in the living area so much of the floor space is
Lot 2 is not directly
below lot 9. Part of the living room of lot 9 is directly over lot 2, and the
kitchen and bathroom of lots
9 and 8 are also over lot 2. These rooms are tiled
and may also be a source of noise into lot 2.
It is her habit not to
wear shoes in the lot, but accepts that visitors do wear shoes.
Photographs taken by her
of the lot in March 2001 were tendered.
She can also hear noise
while in her unit however she is not always sure of the source of the noise.
Sometimes the sound of people
in the stairway is sufficient to wake
Complaints were received
in 1999 about noise from her stereo and she put items under it to limit the
Ms Tran denied generally
that she made much noise while in the lot and in particular that she dragged
furniture across her lot. She
relied on the photographs to show the lot is
sparsely furnished. She also denied having parties at the lot. Her sister and
who is four years old visit on occasion, but most time is spent on the
balcony when they visit.
In response to questions
by Ms Reed, Ms Tran denied changing the configuration of the living room after
the visit of the Council inspector.
A statutory declaration
of R J Grady dated 24 May 2001 was provided. Mr Grady occupied premises
adjacent to Ms Tran and at no time
has he heard noise from Ms Tran or her
An undated letter of S
Foley of lot 3 was provided. Ms Foley has occupied the flat for two years. She
has not heard noise from lot
9 other than the usual sounds. When she stood in
the hall underneath lot 9 she was able to hear Ms Trans footsteps while she was
in the corridor but not once she entered her unit.
She says in March 2001
she requested access to Ms Poddebsky's flat and offered access to her flat to
arrange for an informal sound
test where members of the owners corporation
inspect lots 2 and 9 while a range of normal activities are conducted in lot 9.
proposal was not accepted. Mr Hunt, the Chairman of the executive committee
and Ms Dalag visited her flat in April. Mr Hunt that
walking sounds could not
be heard though some noise from the kitchen or bathroom would be
The request for access
was raised as an issue at the hearing on 14 May 2001 and the matter was
adjourned to allow the parties to make
arrangements.
Ms Tran followed up the
question of an informal inspection by email with the managing agent on 29 May
The matter was
considered by the executive committee on 13 June 2001. No agreement to do the
inspection was reached. This was noted
in a facsimile from Ms Tran to the
managing agent on 15 June 2001.
Ms Tran and Mr
Robinson on her behalf submitted it was unfair to her that she was not given an
opportunity to carry out testing of
the noise transmission between the lots.
She is not in a position to meet the case against her as access was not
Relevant Provisions
By-law 14 Floor coverings
(1) An owner of a lot must ensure that all floor space within the lot
is covered or otherwise treated to an extent sufficient to
prevent the
transmission from the floor space of noise likely to disturb the peaceful
enjoyment of the owner or occupier of another
by-law does not apply to floor space comprising a kitchen, laundry, lavatory
or bathroom.
This by-law was previously by-law 25
in Schedule 1 to the
Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act 1973
by- law 26 in Schedule 3 to the
Strata Schemes (Leasehold Development) Act
By-law 14 imposes an objective test,
namely, would the noise that is being transmitted from the floor space be likely
to disturb the
peaceful enjoyment of a reasonable person? The reference to
peaceful enjoyment rather than just enjoyment imports notions of tranquility,
quietness and freedom from disturbance.
The owners corporation as the
applicant for the penalty bears the onus of proof on the balance of
probabilities. The evidence given
on behalf of the owners corporation is that
various types of noises can be heard through the floor space including the sound
of footsteps,
furniture being moved and items being dropped. These noises have
affected the peaceful enjoyment of Ms Poddebsky in lot 2. That
evidence is
given from her personal observations as well as a tape recording made by her.
No expert evidence was given to support that evidence from an acoustic
engineer or someone experienced in testing and evaluating noise
The owners corporation despite several requests has denied Ms
Tran the opportunity to test that evidence by making similar informal
observations or recordings. The requests were made by Ms Tran orally and in
writing before and after the first hearing. The opportunity
for Ms Tran to have
access to lot 2 to carry out such testing was also raised at the first hearing
and the adjournment of the matter
created an opportunity for such access to be
provided prior to Ms Tran completing her evidence.
The question of access
was considered by the owners corporation at an executive committee meeting after
the first hearing. The minutes
of that meeting were not provided however a
letter from the Chairman supports a finding that access would only be permitted
acoustic engineer if Ms Tran was prepared to share half the cost of
obtaining the report. The other half would be met by the owners
corporation.
The only evidence of noise transmission is from personal experience of
the owner of lot 2. Ms Tran was denied an opportunity to make
investigations and carry out informal testing, the equivalent of the owners
corporation's evidence. In the circumstances
I am not satisfied I should place
much weight on that evidence. By denying an opportunity to carry out similar
investigations to
test that evidence it is open to me to infer that such testing
would not have supported that evidence.
When weighing that evidence
against Ms Tran's general denials, her evidence about her use of the premises,
the fact that other parts
of lots 9 and 8 which may be tiled are over lot 2 and
the observations of Ms Foley, although not sworn, there is no reason why I
should prefer the evidence of the owners corporation over that of Ms Tran. They
bear the onus of proof and I am not satisfied the
owners corporation has proven
the transmission of noise in breach of the notice to comply.
application is therefore dismissed.
