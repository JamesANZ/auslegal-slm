Sentencing Snapshot 273: Sentencing Trends for Murder in the Higher Courts
of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of murder
in the Supreme Court of Victoria from 2017-18 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on murder and other offences is available on
Advisory Council Statistics (SACStat)
The offence of murder applies to the most serious homicides - when a person
intentionally or recklessly kills another or inflicts
severe injury on another
person who dies as a result. Murder is an indictable offence that carries a
maximum penalty of life
imprisonment.
Murder is a category 1 offence if it was committed on or after 20 March 2017.
For this offence, this classification means that courts
must always impose a
custodial sentence.
Murder is also
a standard sentence offence if it was committed on or after 1 February 2018.
This means that courts must take into
account that a prison sentence of 25 years
(or 30 years if the victim was a custodial officer or emergency worker on duty)
the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this
This Snapshot focuses on cases where murder was the principal offence, that
is, cases where murder was the offence that received the
most severe
Murder was the principal offence in 2.8% of cases sentenced in the higher
courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 97 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of murder.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
murder by financial year. There were 12 people sentenced
for this offence in
2021-22, up from 9 in the previous year. The number of people sentenced was
highest in 2017-18 (27 people) and
lowest in 2020-21 (9 people). There were 38
people whose offending attracted standard sentence offence classification. The
sentence in all of those cases was 25 years. None of the victims were
custodial officers or emergency workers on duty.

The proportion of people who received an immediate
custodial sentence was 100%

of imprisonment (91.8%, or 89 of 97 people).
All of the remaining people
received either a custodial supervision order (6.2%, or 6 people) or a
non-custodial supervision order
(2.1%, or 2 people).

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the offence of murder from 2017-18 to 2021-22.
The principal sentence applies to a single offence at a
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves multiple charges,
the total effective sentence will be either the same as or longer than the
Principal sentences of imprisonment
All 89 people who received a principal sentence of
imprisonment for murder received a
non-aggregate
imprisonment term, that
is, the imprisonment term was not part of an aggregate
None of these
imprisonment terms were combined orders of imprisonment and a community
correction order.
The lengths of these imprisonment terms is shown in Figure 3. Imprisonment
terms ranged from 13 years
life imprisonment, while the median length was 23 years (meaning that half of
the imprisonment terms were below 23 years and half
were above). The most common
range of imprisonment terms was 20 to less than 21 years (11 people).

Figure 4 shows that the average length of imprisonment (excluding life)
imposed on people sentenced for murder ranged from 20 years
and 2 months in
2020-21 to 24 years in 2019-20. Over the five years, the average length of
imprisonment for murder was 22 years.
The average length of imprisonment when
murder was a standard sentence offence was 22 years and 4 months.
The lengths of imprisonment imposed when murder was a standard sentence
offence are presented separately because courts sentencing
standard sentence
offences 'must only have regard to sentences previously imposed for the offence
as a standard sentence offence'.
Courts sentencing non-standard sentence offences must have regard to sentences
imposed when the offence both was and was not a standard
sentence offence.

Non-parole periods
For imprisonment terms of 2 years or more, the court
must impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
period, the person must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the
person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for murder face multiple
charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks at the
of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of murder.
Figure 9 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
murder by the total number of sentenced offences per person.
The number of
sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 33, while the median was 1
offence. There were 73 people (75.3%) sentenced
for the single offence of
murder. The average number of offences per person was 2.

people sentenced for murder. The last column sets out the
average number of
offences sentenced per person. For example, 4 of the total 97 people (4.1%) also

burglary. On average, they were sentenced for
1.0 charges of aggravated burglary per case.

for murder in the higher courts. Of these people, 89 (91.8%) received a
sentence of imprisonment, and the remaining people received either a
custodial supervision order (6 people) or a non-custodial supervision
Total effective sentences ranged from 14 years to life imprisonment. The
median total effective sentence was 23 years and 4 months,
while the median
length of imprisonment was 23 years. Non-parole periods ranged from 9 years to

period was 18 years. On average, people
sentenced for murder were sentenced for 2 offences each, with a maximum of 33
Of the 38 principal offences of murder subject to the standard sentence of 25
years, 35 received imprisonment, 2 received a custodial
supervision order, and 1
received a non-custodial supervision order. The average imprisonment term for
those 35 principal offences
was 22 years and 9 months, which is higher than the
overall average of 22 years for the 89 principal offences that received
imprisonment
during this period.
