DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
On 27 July 2011, the Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review
and to refuse to depart from the child support assessment.
This means the application for review has been successful.
DATE OF DESPATCH:
8 August 2011
REASONS FOR DECISION
Moore is the parent liable to pay child support to Ms Moore for their children
Tracey, born 2005, and Amelia, born 2007. The children
are in greater than
primary care of Ms Moore. The matter was registered with the Child Support
Agency (CSA) from 24 October 2008.
administrative assessment of child support for the period from 1 October 2009 to
31 December 2010 was based on an adjusted taxable
income of $9,012 for Mr Moore
(his 2008/09 taxable income), and an adjusted taxable income of $13,729 for Ms
Moore (her 2008/09 taxable
income). The assessment was for the payment of $356
18 September 2009, Ms Moore lodged a departure application on the basis of Mr
Moore’s income and earning capacity.
Senior Case Officer decided on 18 November 2009 that the assessment produced an
unjust and inequitable level of child support and
that for the period 1 December
2009 to 31 October 2012, Mr Moore’s adjusted taxable income should be set
at $48,000.
Moore objected to that decision on 30 November 2009 and on 19 January 2010 an
Objections Officer disallowed the objection. Mr Moore
applied to the Social
Security Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal), on 28 January 2010 to have the
decision reviewed.
20 May 2010, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal), decided that
for the period 1 December 2009 to 31 October 2012,
the annual rate of child
support payable by Mr Moore be set at $9,470. Mr Moore had been removed as a
party to the application for
review when the Tribunal was unable to contact him
at the pre-arranged time. The Tribunal found that based on the available
Mr Moore had significant financial resources not reflected in the
administrative assessment and that it was fair for him to meet
two thirds of the
necessary costs of the children which totalled $14,205 annually. This became the
new administrative assessment.
14 September 2010, Mr Moore applied for a departure from the administrative
assessment on the basis of the high contact costs involved
in spending time and
communicating with his children (reason one), and because the assessment was
unfair because of his income and
financial resources (reason eight).
Senior Case Officer decided on 18 October 2010 that no reasons were established
to depart from the administrative assessment.
Moore lodged a written objection to that decision on 7 January 2011 together
with an extension of time application. The extension
of time was granted and on
9 March 2011 the Objections Officer decided to allow the objection in part.
Objections Officer stated that he was able to consider the application which
covered a period set by a previous decision because
there had been a significant
change in Mr Moore’s circumstances in that on 29 October 2010, Mr Moore
sold his dwelling and
had surplus proceeds of approximately $466,000 available
Objections Officer decided that:
For the period 1
January 2011 until 30 June 2011, Mr Moore’s adjusted taxable income be set
at $45,000 per annum;
For the period 1
July 2011 until 30 September 2012, Mr Moore’s adjusted taxable income be
set at $46,710 per annum;
For the period 1
January 2011 until 30 June 2011, Ms Moore’s adjusted taxable income be set
at $43,273 per annum;
For the period 1
July 2011 until 30 September 2012, Ms Moore’s adjusted taxable income be
set at $44,917 per annum.
Objection Officer found that in the child support period 1 October 2009 to 31
December 2010, Mr Moore had three contact visits
with his children and estimated
that the costs incurred by Mr Moore were $2,347. In the above period, Mr
Moore’s income was
$11,265, (adjusted taxable income of $9,012 in 2008/09
extrapolated over 15 months). As Mr Moore’s contact costs exceeded more
than 5% of his adjusted taxable income, the Objections Officer found the ground
established, but decided it was not just and equitable
to amend the assessment
as the costs do not exceed 5% of the current adjusted taxable income of $45,000.
21 March 2011 Ms Moore lodged an application for review with the Tribunal
against the decision of 9 March 2011.
16 May 2011, a pre hearing conference was held.
20 May 2011, Mr Moore and Ms Moore were issued with directions pursuant to
subsections 103(2), 103ZA(1)(b), and 110X of the Child
Support (Registration
& Collection) Act 1988. These directions informed them that a hearing of the
application for review was
fixed for 27 July 2011 and of the requirement for
each party to provide specified evidence.
Moore was required to provide by 17 June 2011:
(i) A completed
Statement of Financial Circumstances Form;
(ii) Copies of her payslips for the last three months;
(iii) Copies of her Centrelink statement showing payments of parenting
(iv) Personal tax returns for the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 financial years
including a full schedule of all expenses claimed and income
earned with regards
to rental property in 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 taxation return, and dividends
from shares;
(v) Copies of all bank account, loan account, investment account and credit
card statements for the last three months for accounts
held either personally or
jointly by Ms Moore;
(vi) Current child support statement;
(vii) Court order or agreements indicating the level of care of the children.
Moore provided additional material in compliance with the directions hearing and
this was numbered A1 – A59.
Moore was required to provide by 17 June 2011;
(i) Details of
dates of contact with the children since mid 2010 to date;
(ii) Receipts of expenses for example air fares, petrol, and accommodation
associated with contact with the children, or details

(vi) Loan application for property C;
(vii) Business activity statements lodged since 1 July 2010;
(viii) Copies of all bank account, loan account, investment account and
credit card statements from 2 February 2011 to date held
either personally or
jointly by Mr Moore.
Moore provided additional material in compliance with the directions hearing and
this was numbered B1 – B94.
CONSIDERATION
The legislative framework and issues for the Tribunal to determine
rate of child support payable by a liable parent is usually based on an
administrative assessment under
Child Support (Assessment) Act
(the Assessment Act). This requires the application of a statutory
formula which takes into account factors such as the number of
children, the
level of care provided and the income of each parent.
liable parent or a carer may apply to the Child Support Registrar for a
determination to depart from the child support administrative
assessment under
Part 6A of the Assessment Act (section 98B). Where an administrative assessment
has been amended to give effect
to a previous departure determination, it
becomes the administrative assessment for all purposes, including a subsequent
application
for a departure determination.
Objections Officer stated erroneously in his decision of 9 March 2011, that he
was only able to consider an application for a
period set by a previous decision
if there is fresh relevant evidence available that was not considered by the
original decision
maker or there has been a significant change in either
parent’s circumstances. This is not the correct test. While section
of the Assessment Act provides that the Registrar may refuse to make a
determination when an application had previously been
refused and no new matter
has been submitted, in this case, the initial application was made by Mr Moore,
and a determination was
made. While this is not an appeal of the earlier
Tribunal decision, it was open to Mr Moore to make a departure application.
this case, the Registrar, and the Tribunal standing in place of the Registrar,
may make a departure determination if the three
matters set out under subsection
98C(1) are established:
(i) that one, or more than one, of the
grounds for departure referred to in subsection 117 (2) exists; and
(ii) that it would be:
(A) just and equitable as regards the child, the liable parent, and the
carer entitled to child support; and
(B) otherwise proper;
to make a particular determination under this Part;
grounds for departure from an administrative assessment of child support are
those set out in section 117(2) of the Assessment
satisfied that a ground or grounds exist and that it would be just and equitable
and otherwise proper to make a particular determination,
the Tribunal must make
one of the determinations prescribed in section 98S of the Assessment Act.
Section 98S sets out the determinations
that may be made under the departure
provisions. It permits a range of determinations, including varying the rate of
child support
payable and the adjusted taxable income of the parents.
QUESTION ONE – DOES A GROUND EXIST TO DEPART FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE
ASSESSMENT?
grounds for departure are set out in section 117(2) of the Assessment Act. In
this case, Mr Moore has relied on two grounds when
he lodged his departure
application on 14 September 2010. The Tribunal considered each ground in turn.
Income, Property and Financial Resources of Either Parent
Subparagraph
117(2)(c)(ia) – commonly referred to as “Reason 8”- provides
as a ground for departure:
(c) that, in the special
circumstances of the case, application in relation to the child of the
provisions of this Act relating to
administrative assessment of child support
would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of
financial support
to be provided by the liable parent for the child:
(ia) because of the income property and financial resources of either
term ‘special circumstances’ expresses the policy that the
administrative assessment formulae is to be departed from
only if it is unfair
to apply the usual calculations, due to unusual features of the circumstances of
the case. It has been described
as meaning ‘facts peculiar to the case
which set it apart from other cases’ (
Savery and Savery
(1990) FLC 92-131
at 77,897) or ‘something special or out of the
ordinary’ (see
requirement that the case not be an ordinary, or ‘run of the mill’,
was spelled out by the Full Family Court in
Gyselman v Gyselman
[1991] FamCA 93
, where Chief Justice Nicholson along with Fogarty and Nygh JJ wrote,
at paragraph 39, of their judgment:
Section 117(2) sets out the
grounds for departure from administrative assessment. Each of those grounds is
prefaced by the words,
‘in the special circumstances of the case’.
Whilst it is not possible to define with precision the meaning of that term,
a generality it is intended to emphasize that the facts of the case must
establish something which is special or out of the ordinary.
That is, the
intention of the Legislature is that the Court will not interfere with the
administrative formula result in the ordinary
run of cases. In Savery's case (p
77-897), Kay J., adopting the view in Philippe (1978) FLC 90433 at p 77202 in a
different context,
said that ‘special circumstances’ were
‘facts peculiar to the particular case which set it apart from other
The approach to the interpretation and application of the
particular grounds in s 117(2) must be guided by that qualification.
little earlier in this case, the Full Court expressed the overall policy served
by the ‘departure’ provisions as follows:
a central feature of the Assessment Act is that child support liabilities are to
be determined administratively by the application
of the legislative formula,
the legislation also provides avenues of challenge or review by the Courts. This
is necessary for a number
of reasons. Firstly, some applications for assessment
will raise critical issues of fact ... Secondly, whilst a general formula may
carry out the legislative intent in the large number of cases, it is recognized
that it will also produce cases of unfairness and
inequity which call for a
variation in the assessment if injustice is to be avoided. The Assessment Act
provides for that to be done,
within the limits it prescribes ...
the present case this means, in very broad terms, that it is not possible to
vary an assessment unless the Tribunal is satisfied
there is some
‘injustice’ and some degree of ‘unusualness’ about the
circumstances being relied on to support
the variation.
this case, Mr Moore sought a departure from the administrative assessment three
months after the decision of the Tribunal. He stated
that the assessment was
unjust and inequitable as his income had been estimated to be $50,000 and yet
the assessment by the Australian
Taxation Office was $20,000. He stated that he
was being forced to sell his home due to limited work.
this case, the Tribunal is not reviewing the correctness of the previous
Tribunal’s decision of 20 May 2010. It does not
have the jurisdiction to
do so. Rather, it is determining whether that decision should be departed from
due to special circumstances
such that the decision is unjust and inequitable.
the hearing, Mr Moore stated he lodged the departure application because the
previous Tribunal had relied on incomplete financial
information when reaching
its decision. Mr Moore had omitted to provide it with a complete set of bank
account transactions, which
Mr Moore said, led the Tribunal to assume he had
undisclosed financial resources. He was also unaware of the implications of not
participating in the phone hearing and was unaware he could be removed as a
party to the proceedings.
Assessment of evidence, findings of fact and application of the law
Tribunal had before it the documents supplied by the Child Support Agency
Registrar under subsection 95(3) of the
Child Support (Registration and
Collection) Act 1988
, together with supplementary documents relating to the
application for review provided by both parties.
Tribunal considered the evidence regarding Mr Moore’s income and financial
determining that Mr Moore had the capacity to meet the costs of two thirds of
the costs of the children, the previous Tribunal
had the benefit of a Statement
of Financial Circumstances form completed by Mr Moore and was satisfied that he
had the capacity to
pay $9,470 per year, or $182 per week.
making this decision, the previous Tribunal had regard to the following:
son Timothy was living with his relatives overseas;
stated income of $281 per week ($100 from his business; $146 newstart allowance;
$25 family allowance; and $10 child
maintenance from Timothy’s mother);
Stated living
expenses of $795 per week;
Earnings from
his business of $25,471 for the period 1 March 2009 to 31 March 2010, which when
added to rent from a flatmate, total
earnings of $27,871;
expenses for the period 1 March 2009 to 31 March 2010 of $12,040, leaving an
amount of earnings of $15,831 which when averaged
over 56 weeks is approximately
$280, not $100 as stated by Mr Moore;
decision to sell his unencumbered home for $480,000 net in June 2009 and obtain
a mortgage for $200,000 in order
to purchase a six bedroom home for $645,000
(property B), on 21 April 2009;
Tribunal does not consider Mr Moore’s omission to provide the previous
Tribunal with complete financial records constituted
circumstance’. He was able to do so, but mistakenly failed to provide
the requested documents. Even had
those records been provided, the Tribunal
cannot be satisfied that the previous Tribunal would have necessarily reached a
conclusion for reasons outlined below.
18 October 2010, the Senior Case Officer found that reason 8 was not
established. He stated that Mr Moore would be required to
have a taxable income
of $66,500 to have an annual rate of $9,470 payable for child support. Mr Moore
had listed personal expenditure
of $3,940 per month (or $47,280 per year) and
that after revising the figures to reflect work related insurance and vehicle
he had personal expenditure of $3,510 per month which equates to a
taxable income of $52,511 per year. The Senior Case Officer was
not satisfied
that Mr Moore had demonstrated how he was able to meet those expenses when he
claimed to have net available funds of
$42,858 and so determined that he had not
been able to establish that he did not have access to other income or financial
He also noted that Mr Moore had listed property B for sale at
$739,000 and that after commissions and repaying a mortgage of $200,000
have retained an amount of $518,182 which represents a capital gain of around
$37,290. He was not satisfied that Mr Moore’s
equity in his property
should not be taken into account for the purposes of assessing child support,
particularly as the parents
had completed a property settlement and Mr Moore had
invested assets and improved his asset base.
Mr Moore’s lodgement of an objection and the granting of an extension of
time application, an Objections Officer decided
that the ground to depart from
the administrative assessment due to reason 8 was established as Mr Moore had
sold property B on 29
October 2010 and from that date had surplus sale proceeds
of approximately $466,000 available to him. He determined it was appropriate
depart from the administrative assessment from 1 January 2011 which closely
aligns with Mr Moore’s objection and extension
of time request on 7
January 2011. In doing so, he found that Mr Moore could potentially earn
interest of $28,000 per year ($466,450.47
multiplied by 6%) plus projected
business income of $17,000 based on business deposits of $8,987.68 over a 95 day
period from 29
October 2010 to 1 February 2011 and a business income to net
profit ratio of 50%. He found that Mr Moore has income and property
available to him equivalent to an income of $45,000 per annum.
Objections Officer found the surplus sale proceeds were a financial resource and
as such there had been a significant change in
Mr Moore’s circumstances.
In the Tribunal’s view however, this change resulted in an improvement in
income and so closely considered whether this change could be
regarded as a special circumstance that subsequently made the administrative
assessment unjust and inequitable.
Moore stated he sold property B because he couldn’t afford the home loan
repayments of $1,200 per month. The property was
vacant for three months before
it was sold as he decided that he and Timothy, who returned from overseas in May
2010, would move
in with his mother. Prior to that, he had three or four people
renting a room from him at various times at $100 per week each.
Moore’s evidence is that he purchased property C for $350,000 on 25 March
2011. He did this with full knowledge of his child
support liability. At
hearing, Mr Moore stated that he was of the opinion that his child support
liability ought to be based on his
income from self employment only, and that
the proceeds from the sale of his home should not be relevant. After purchasing
C, Mr Moore invested $100,000. He provided evidence of a balance on 1
June 2011 of $100,493.16.
hearing, Mr Moore stated that there was now only $60,000 invested. He bought a
car for $15,000 for personal use and spent $25,000
on renovating property C. It
was falling apart when he bought it. He is saving money by doing a lot of the
work himself when he can
and expects it will cost at least a further $25,000 in
renovations.
Moore considers his child support liability should be based on his income as
assessed by the ATO, and that the fact that he sold
property B and invested the
proceeds should not be relevant to his child support liability, yet it is this
change that he has sought
to rely upon as the basis for a departure
determination.
Moore’s current circumstances are that he has bought an unencumbered
property (property C) in March 2011 with the proceeds
from the sale and intends
to use that money to renovate the property. He is self employed. He is however,
able to do a lot of the
work in renovating his home without having to pay other
people. He told the Tribunal that he voluntarily surrendered his newstart
allowance at the beginning of the year and that any cash jobs he does goes
through his bank account.
Moore submitted that Mr Moore’s decision to become a devout religious
follower severely impacted upon his ability to work
due to the time involved in
following his faith. He had started spending increasingly long periods of time
in 2007 practicing his
faith and in late 2008 they separated. There were two
periods where Timothy lived overseas with relatives, the last period ended
May 2010 when Mr Moore left the religion and travelled overseas to bring Timothy
and spent time in City A where
she lived with the children. He saw more of the girls while he was here working.
said that property B was purchased with the intention that it be used as a venue
for religious gatherings. Ms Moore finds it inconceivable
that Mr Moore is only
earning $20 per hour at his trade. Ms Moore submitted that the CSA was wrong to
base his projected income on
an assessment of his business deposits over a 95
day period from 29 October 2010 to 1 February 2011. During this period, Mr Moore
was overseas from 26 November 2010 to 31 December 2010 and so determining his
income on this period is inappropriate.
Moore stated he had his phone on international roaming while he was overseas and
does not consider his absence impacted upon his
work. He denied buying property
B with the intention it be used as a religious centre. Property B was a contact
address only because
he held a reportable position within his religious group.
In the Marriage of M J Ross and G P McDermott
[1998] FamCA 134
(1998) 23 Fam LR
, the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia stated “
which we have formed is that it would be inappropriate and a misreading of the
requirements of
s 117(2)(c)(i)
for special circumstances of the type defined
there, to be established merely upon proof of a change in the "income, earning
property and financial resources" of that party. It is, we think,
implicit in para (c)(i) read overall that that circumstance has
to be compared
with that person's commitments in order to arrive at a view that there would be
an "unjust and inequitable determination
of a level of financial support".
Moore asserts the administrative assessment of child support would result in an
unjust and inequitable determination of the level
of support to be provided by
him for the children. Mr Moore has failed to demonstrate this.
Tribunal was not satisfied that Mr Moore’s circumstances are special such
that the administrative assessment of $9,470 per
annum based on the necessary
costs of the children, would lead to an unjust and inequitable determination of
the level of financial
support to be provided by Mr Moore.
The cost of spending time with, or having contact with the children
second ground on which Mr Moore sought to depart from the administrative
assessment relied on his claims that the costs he incurs
in spending time with
Tracey and Amelia are high as they live in City A and he lives in City B.
Subparagraph
117(2)(a)(iv) of the Assessment Act provides as a ground for departure:
(b) that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs
of maintaining the child are significantly affected:
(i) because of high costs involved in enabling a parent to spend time
with, or communicate with, the child; or
term ‘special circumstances’ is not defined in the Assessment Act.
Gyselman v Gyselman
[1991] FamCA 93
[1992] FLC 92-279
the Full Family Court indicated
that for there to be special circumstances, the facts of the case must establish
something which
is special or out of the ordinary.
the hearing Mr Moore provided list of expenses incurred by him in having contact
with the children in 2010 and 2011. At the hearing,
Mr Moore stated he had based
his expenses of $900 per visit on a calculation done by the Senior Case Officer
on 18 October 2010.
He has not kept any receipts of expenses, and is unable to
explain why he has not done so.
Moore stated he saw the children for three periods during school holidays and in
2010 his costs were:
$900 for travel
for three trips with travel of 4,000kms each trip, (1,000 km in each direction
from City B to City A);
Accommodation of
$960 based on accommodation at $480 per visit. He stays at a place half way for
one or two nights on each leg of
each visit.
addition, he claimed servicing of vehicle $450 per year, phone calls of $5 per
week ($260 per year), and 28 small trips when he
was working for eight weeks in
City A from August to November 2010 based on 40 km travelled each trip. Mr Moore
stated he did not
keep a log book but does not claim this component of his
expenses as a tax deduction.
the 2011 year to date Mr Moore has claimed that his costs are:
$700 for travel
for two trips with travel of 4,000 each trip stating the cost of petrol had
accommodation based on $500 per visit for two trips.
Phone calls and
wear and tear on motor vehicles of $350.
Moore stated she writes down the dates Mr Moore has care of the children and her
record of the transport arrangements are as follows:
June 2010: She
flew to City B with the girls, Mr Moore drove the girls back to City A
July 2010: Mr
Moore came to City A for work;
August 2010: Mr
Moore came to City A for work and stayed seven days;
September 2010:
Mr Moore came to City A for work, drove the girls back to City B to spend time
with him, then drove them back to City
October 2010:
Mr Moore came to City A and worked.
January 2011: Mr
Moore picked up the girls and drove to City B then drove them back after two and
a half weeks;
April 2011: Mr
Moore came to City A for work;
July 2011: Mr
Moore drove to City A, picked up the girls and took them to City B, then drove
Tribunal is satisfied that Mr Moore incurs additional costs to spend time with
the children due to the distance involved.
Assessment of evidence, findings of fact and application of the law
1 July 2008 subsection 117(2B) of the Assessment Act applies and provides that a
parent’s costs involved in enabling the
parent to have contact with a
child can only be high if the costs that have been or will be incurred during a
child support period
total more than 5% of the amount worked out by:
dividing the
parent’s adjusted taxable income for the period by 365; and
multiplying the
quotient by the number of days in the period.
Moore did not provide a copy of any receipts to support his departure
application and at the hearing sought to rely on the calculations
made by the
Senior Case Officer in his decision on 18 October 2010. At that time, five
receipts for fuel were provided which indicated
the cost was $234 for one return
trip, or $468 for two return trips.
of accommodation costs in September 2010 was $89 for one night when Mr Moore was
travelling on his own and $120 for the night
when the children were travelling
with him; a total of $418 for two return trips ($89 + $120 +$120 +$89). On that
basis, the Senior
Case Officer found that the cost for spending time with the
children was $886 ($468 fuel + $418 accommodation) for two return trips
Tribunal does not accept that it is necessary for Mr Moore to spend two nights
in accommodation on each leg of the trip.
Moore did not keep a log book of his travel to see the children and so the
Tribunal does not consider it reasonable to take into
consideration a mileage
allowance for the time that Mr Moore was in City A for the purpose of work.
Similarly, there is no basis
to his stated costs of wear and tear on his vehicle
and the Tribunal could not be satisfied that this cost would not be claimed as
business deduction despite Mr Moore’s claims that he only claims a
proportion of those expenses for work related purposes.
Similarly, Mr
Moore’s claim for phone calls to speak to his children was not verified.
Tribunal therefore considered that the costs incurred in spending time with
Tracey and Amelia over the child support period 1
October 2009 to 31 December
2010 to be:
December 2009:
$788 based on one return trip ($433) plus air travel with one child $345;
June 2010: $673
based on one return car trip $433 plus air travel with two children one way
September 2010:
$866 based on two return trips by car 2 x $443
$2,347 in the period 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2010.
Tribunal is satisfied that $2,347 represents more than 5% of the adjusted
taxable income for Mr Moore in the child support period
and so the costs can be
considered high.
the child support period 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2012, Mr Moore’s
adjusted taxable income was his 2009/10 income of $20,412
which when applied
over a 15 month period is $25,515. The Tribunal assessed his costs incurred in
spending time with Tracey and Amelia
January 2011:
$886 based on two return trips by car;
July 2011: $866
based on two return trips by car
$1,772 to date in the current child support period.
Tribunal is satisfied that $1,772 represents more than 5% of the adjusted
taxable income (5% of $25,515 = $1,275) for Mr Moore
in the child support period
and so the contact costs can be considered high for the current child support
is therefore evident that Mr Moore’s costs in enabling him to spend time
with, or communicate with, the children are high.
Before the Tribunal can be
satisfied that this ground for departure exists, the Tribunal also must be
satisfied that there are special
circumstances and that these costs
significantly affect Mr Moore’s costs of maintaining the children.
September 2010 Mr Moore had a sum of $466,000 invested. Even after the purchase
of property C in March 2011, Mr Moore had $100,000
invested until his recent
expenditure on renovations and a second car. In light of the actual level of
financial resources Mr Moore
had during the period concerned, the Tribunal does
not consider that these “high” contact costs significantly affect
his costs of maintaining the children. There is therefore no ground to depart
from the administrative assessment.
section 98F of the Act, the Registrar may refuse to make a determination without
taking any further action if:
(i) there are no grounds for
departing; or
(ii) it would not be just and equitable to make a determination; or
(iii) it would not be otherwise proper to make a determination.
As there was no ground established, the Tribunal did not proceed to consider
whether a determination would be just and equitable and
otherwise proper.
The Tribunal’s determination
On 27 July 2011, the Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review
and to refuse to depart from the child support assessment.
This means the application for review has been successful.
