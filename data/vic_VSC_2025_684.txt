HIS HONOUR:
Introduction
5 November 2025, I made two orders. The first granted MB’s application
Sex Offenders Registration Act 2004
(‘the Act’) to suspend his reporting obligations. The second
required the use of pseudonyms for the applicant and
the original complainant in
this proceeding and in any material published in connection with this
proceeding. At the time of making
those two orders I indicated I would provide
written reasons in due course. I do so now.
2008, MB, who was aged 20, engaged in sexual intercourse several times with MD,
who was aged 15. The relationship was reported
to police after MB was introduced
to MD’s family by MD.
2009, MB pleaded guilty to and was convicted of four counts of sexual
penetration of a child under the age of 16, contrary to
(Vic), as it then stood. The sentencing judge, based on the expert
evidence of forensic psychologist Jeffrey Cummins, found that
MB was immature
psycho-sexually and that there had been no grooming of MD: the two met up after
MD posted a personal advertisement
on a networking site. MB was sentenced to a
total effective sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment suspended for 18
since offending
being sentenced approximately 16 years ago, MB has not been in any further
trouble with the law and has been compliant with
his reporting obligations. He
is in a long-term, stable relationship. He has led an industrious life.
complications
work involves overseas travel, which is complicated by his reporting
obligations. He may be required to travel overseas at short
notice, but there
are delays of 6–8 weeks in obtaining permission for such travel from the
police pursuant to his reporting
obligations.
additional difficulty is that the parents of MB’s long-term partner live
overseas. His partner’s father is in failing
health. MB’s partner is
fearful of flying alone.
application is strongly supported by testimonials from co-workers, family,
friends and even the complainant from the original
criminal proceedings.
is also a recent report from forensic psychologist Jeffrey Cummins which states,
most relevantly:
In my opinion [MB’s] risk of committing a further sexual offence remains
low – which is the lowest risk rating a psychologist/psychiatrist
practising in Australia can assign. On the basis of both historical and recent
assessment of [MB] it is my opinion there is no need
for him be offered or be
directed to participate in any further offence specific treatment.
Applications
Chief Commissioner of Police did not oppose the application to suspend
MB’s reporting obligations, having regard to MB’s
positive progress
over the last 16 years, his work and personal commitments and Mr Cummins’
expert evidence. Nor did the Chief
Commissioner oppose the pseudonym order.
relevant provisions of the Act are, in particular,
39 Supreme Court may suspend certain registrable offenders’ reporting
obligations
(1) This section applies to a registrable offender who is required to continue
to comply with the reporting obligations imposed by
this Part for the remainder
of his or her life.
(a) a period of 15 years has passed (ignoring any period during which the
registrable offender was in government custody) since he
or she was last
sentenced or released from government custody in respect of a registrable
offence or a corresponding registrable
offence, whichever is later; and
(b) he or she did not become the subject of a life-long reporting period under a
corresponding Act whilst in a foreign jurisdiction
before becoming the subject
of such a period in Victoria; and
(c) he or she is not on parole in respect of a registrable offence—
the registrable offender may apply to the Supreme Court for an order suspending
his or her reporting obligations.
40 Order for suspension
(1) On the application under section 39(2), the Supreme Court may make an order
suspending the registrable offender's reporting obligations.
(2) A court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied
(a) the registrable offender poses no risk or a low risk to the sexual safety of
one or more persons or of the community; and
(b) it is in the public interest to suspend the registrable offender’s
reporting obligations.
(3) In deciding whether to make an order under this section, a court must take
into account—
(a) the seriousness of the registrable offender’s registrable offences and
corresponding registrable offences; and
(b) the period of time since those offences were committed; and
(c) the age of the registrable offender, the age of the victims of those
offences and the difference in age between the registrable
offender and the
victims of those offences, as at the time those offences were committed; and
(d) the registrable offender’s present age; and
(e) the registrable offender’s total criminal record; and
(f) any other matter the court considers appropriate.
(4) In deciding whether to make an order under subsection (1), the Supreme Court
must also take into account any submissions made
by the Chief Commissioner under
section 41.
Conclusions
light of the matters referred to above, especially the expert evidence of
Mr Cummins, I was satisfied that MB is a low risk to
the sexual safety of
others in the community and that it was in the public’s interest to
suspend MB’s reporting obligations
was also satisfied that, in the exercise of the court’s inherent
the abovementioned
pseudonym order. In my view, such an order strikes a proper balance between, on
the one hand, open justice (that
is, allowing for the publication of these
reasons) and, on the other hand, the public interest in not undermining the
progress made
by MB in his personal and professional life.
