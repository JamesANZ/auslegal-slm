Recommendation 1
– That the Department for
Correctional Services continue to identify and eliminate hanging points from
cells in all South Australian
correctional facilities.
Responses from SAPOL
Compliance with
this recommendation already exists in all SAPOL cell facilities, including those
declared as Police Prisons under
the Correctional Services (Declaration of
Police Prisons) Act 2007.
Recommendation 6
– That all forms needed for the admission of a
prisoner, whether in electronic or paper format, be reviewed to improve their
ease of use for the correctional officer and the prisoner.
The Department
for Correctional Services has a new computer system known as `iSafe' which is
being implemented to address admissions
and related material. There have been no
requests made of SAPOL to amend any aspects of the current Shield Detainee
Transfer Report
and the Custody Management Portfolio considers the current
format acceptable.
Recommendation 7
– That the preferred method for admission be by
computer records that are easily accessible and formatted.
Recommendation 11
– Items that have the potential to act as
ligatures should be classified as contraband within the Department for
Correctional
Services institutions, or at least within Department for
Correctional Services custodial facilities that have not had cells updated

facilities. This is prescribed in General
Order, Custody Management which
requires members to consider "Items on the person that may cause injury or harm
to the detainee or
others". Further, guidance is contained in
regulation 82
Police Regulations 2014
which outline that members must consider removing
any items which may "be used to cause injury or harm to the prisoner or any
