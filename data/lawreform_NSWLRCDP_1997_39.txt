Discussion Paper 39 (1997) - Review of Section 316 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)
Summary of Options for Reform
History of this Reference (Digest)
OPTION 1 - ABOLISH S 316
Section 316 should be abolished. The terms of the section are so wide that it intrudes into a range of confidential relationships.
The social utility of the section is outweighed by the potential for harm to these valuable relationships.
OPTION 2 - BENEFIT ONLY OFFENCE
Section 316 should be amended so that the offence is only made out when the defendant accepts or agrees to accept a benefit in money
or money’s worth in return for failing to disclose an offence.
OPTION 3 - SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS
Section 316 should be amended to provide that legal practitioners, medical practitioners / counsellors / psychologists / social workers
and priests who acquire information about serious offences in the course of their profession or vocation are not guilty of an offence
for failing to disclose it, in accordance with the doctrine of privilege. The section should also be amended to provide that engaging
in genuine research constitutes a reasonable excuse for concealment of information about serious offences from the police.

1. Introduction
History of this Reference (Digest)
Section 316(1)
(NSW) provides that where a person has committed a “serious offence”, it is an offence in certain circumstances for another
person who knows or believes that the offence has been committed to fail to report the information to the police or an appropriate
The maximum penalty for an offence under
is imprisonment for two years. “Serious offence” is defined in
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) as an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more or life.
Sections 316(2)
(NSW) provide that it is an offence to accept or agree to accept certain benefits in consideration for committing an offence under
The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for five years.
1.3 This Discussion Paper considers whether the offences contained in
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) should be amended or abolished.
THE COMMISSION’S REFERENCE
1.4 On 1 August 1997 the Attorney General, the Hon Jeff Shaw QC MLC, referred to the Commission the question whether the offences
contained in
should be abolished or amended.
1.5 In 1994 the Criminal Law Review Division of the Attorney General’s Department commenced a review of
9CHP1_3" href="#fnDP39CHP1_3">
In October 1995, a Working Party of the Criminal Law Review Division of the Attorney General’s Department was convened to
examine the use of
and to consider whether it was necessary to develop guidelines to clarify the meaning of “reasonable excuse” in the section.
In 1996, the Working Party proposed that
be amended so that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions be required in relation to the continuance of prosecutions
of certain classes of persons, which were to be prescribed by regulation.
1.6 This proposal was adopted in a 1997 bill to amend
The Bill was assented to on 30 September 1997, but has not yet been proclaimed.
It is expected that the Act will come into operation by the end of 1997. Parliamentary Counsel have commenced drafting regulations
under the Act which it is expected will come into operation simultaneously with the Act.
THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PAPER
1.7 This Discussion Paper adopts the following structure:
Chapter 1 states the issue and sets out the Commission’s terms of reference.
Chapter 2 outlines the law in New South Wales.
Chapter 3 analyses the law in other Australian jurisdictions and in overseas jurisdictions with similar offences.
Chapter 4 addresses the issues whether the law of New South Wales should be amended or whether all or part of
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) should be abolished, and contains the Commission’s preliminary proposals.

2. The Law in New South Wales
History of this Reference (Digest)
HISTORY OF SECTION 316
2.1 Section 316 was inserted into the
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) in 1990 as part of a package of amendments to the
The purpose of the amendments was to create a comprehensive statement of the law relating to public justice offences which, until
the enactment of the amendments, was “fragmented and confusing, consisting of various common law and statutory provisions,
with many gaps, anomalies and uncertainties”.
The section replaced the common law misdemeanour of misprision of felony.
The common law offence consisted of knowing that a felony had been committed and failing to disclose that knowledge to those responsible
for the preservation of the peace within a reasonable time and having had a reasonable opportunity for doing so.
In England, the common law offence was replaced with a statutory offence in 1967, following the abolition of the distinction between
felonies and misdemeanours in that jurisdiction.
However, the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours still exists in New South Wales.
SECTION 316
Section 316
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) provides that:
Concealing serious offences
316(1) If a person has committed a serious offence and another person who knows or believes that the offence has been committed and
that he or she has information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of the offender or the prosecution
or conviction of the offender for it fails without reasonable excuse to bring that information to the attention of a member of the
Police Force or other appropriate authority, that other person is liable to imprisonment for 2 years.
(2) A person who solicits, accepts or agrees to accept any benefit for himself or herself or any other person in consideration for
doing anything that would be an offence under subsection (1) is liable to imprisonment for 5 years.
(3) It is not an offence against subsection (2) merely to solicit, accept or agree to accept the making good of loss or injury caused
by an offence or the making or reasonable compensation for that loss or injury.
The meaning of “serious offence” in
An offence punishable by imprisonment or penal servitude for 5 years or more or for life.
Murder, sexual assault and theft are serious offences under
Growing small amounts of marijuana and prostitution are offences which are not serious under the section.
2.3 Although
requires that the concealed offence be a “serious offence”, it is not necessary for the prosecution to establish that
the defendant knew that the offence was a serious offence.
Section 316
applies whenever a person who knows or believes that an offence has been committed “has information which might be of material
assistance” in the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of the offender. The section clearly applies to a person where the
offender has confessed to that person. However, the section also applies where a person has information (other than admissions or
confessions) about other real or circumstantial evidence of an offence. The term “information” includes information in
the nature of hearsay, as well as information which would be admissible in court as evidence.
BASIS OF RULE
2.5 The policy rationale of
is that it serves the public interest by encouraging citizens to provide information about serious offences to law enforcement authorities.
CONVICTIONS UNDER
SECTION 316
2.6 In the Local Courts, 85 cases under
were documented in the period June 1992 to May 1997. Thirty four cases under
were recorded in the higher courts in a slightly longer reporting period, from the commencement of the operation of
in 1990 to December 1996.
Local Courts
2.7 81 cases under
are recorded during the reporting period.
The accused pleaded guilty in 71 cases. Forty seven offenders had prior convictions of some type, although the statistical information
available does not indicate the type of prior offences. Four offenders were charged with multiple counts. The penalty imposed in
most cases in the Local Courts was either a fine, ranging between $100.00 and $500.00, or a bond under s 558 of the
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW). Custodial sentences were rare; only seven prison sentences, ranging from two months to seven months, were imposed on offenders
during the period. A full breakdown of penalties imposed is set out at 2.8 below.

2.9 Four cases under
are recorded during the reporting period. The accused pleaded guilty in every case. Two offenders had prior convictions of some type,
although the statistical information available does not indicate the type of prior offences. No offenders were charged with multiple
counts. Fines of $300.00 and $4,000.00 were imposed in two cases. In one case, the offender received a bond under s 558 of
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) and in the other case a compound penalty of a bond under s 558 and a fine was imposed.
Higher courts
2.10 34 cases under
are recorded in the higher courts during the reporting period. The accused pleaded guilty in every case. Nine offenders had prior
convictions, although none were for the same or similar offences.
Two offenders were charged with multiple counts. The penalty imposed in most cases in the higher courts was either a bond under
s 558 of the
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) or a community service order. Community service orders required between 50 hours and 500 hours of community service work, with
the majority requiring between 250 hours and 300 hours of community service. Custodial sentences were also rare in the higher courts.
Only two prison sentences, both of six months, were imposed during the period. A full breakdown of penalties imposed is set out
at 2.11 below.

RELATED OFFENCES
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) contains several other offences relating to the concealment of offences.
Hindering investigations
Section 315
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) provides that:
315(1) A person who does anything intending in any way to hinder:
(a) the investigation of a serious offence committed by another person; or
(b) the discovery of evidence concerning a serious offence committed by another person; or
(c) the apprehension of another person who has committed a serious offence;
is liable to penal servitude for 7 years.
“Serious offence” has the same meaning for these offences as it does for
There is also a specific offence of tampering with or fabricating evidence or knowingly making use of fabricated evidence with the
intention of misleading a court, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for ten years.
These offences, which cover situations where the accused does a positive act to prevent the investigation of the offence or tamper
with evidence, can be contrasted with
, which makes it an offence merely to have knowledge of a serious offence in certain circumstances.
Interference with judicial officers, witnesses, jurors and police
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) also contains a series of offences which relate to interference with judicial officers, witnesses and jurors by corruption,
threats, intimidation, and preventing a witness or juror from attending court. The penalties for committing these offences are imprisonment
for periods ranging between five years and fourteen years.
It is an offence to wilfully obstruct a police officer executing his or her duties. The penalty for this offence is five years’
imprisonment.
It is also an offence to resist or hinder or incite another person to resist or hinder a police officer. The penalty for this offence
is imprisonment for one year or a $1000.00 fine.
Aiding and abetting, accessories
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) contains a series of aiding and abetting provisions and accessory offences,
as well as aiding and abetting provisions in relation to specific offences.
2.17 A person is guilty of aiding and abetting an offence if he or she is present when the offence is committed and the person assists
or encourages the offender to commit the offence, or is ready and willing to assist or encourage the offender to commit the offence.
If there is no common purpose between the two, there must be actual encouragement in some form or other.
In contrast,
makes it an offence merely to have knowledge of a serious offence in certain circumstances, without assisting or encouraging the
offender in any way or being prepared to do so if required.
2.18 A person is guilty of being an accessory before the fact of an offence if, although not present at the time of the offence, the
person intentionally procures, incites or encourages the offence in some way.
A person is guilty of being an accessory after the fact of an offence if, although not present at the time of the offence, the person
assists the offender in any way to dispose of the proceeds of the crime or to avoid apprehension, trial or punishment.
Again, the distinction between
and the accessory offences is that mere knowledge that a person intends to or has committed a crime is not enough for liability as
an accessory.

Discussion Paper 39 (1997) - Review of Section 316 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)
3. Comparison with Other Jurisdictions
History of this Reference (Digest)
3.1 Most other Australian jurisdictions have provisions which make failure to disclose knowledge of an offence to the police an offence
in certain circumstances. England has also replaced the common law offence of misprision of felony with a modified statutory offence.
It did so at the same time as it abolished the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours. That distinction still exists in New
South Wales. The elements of the offences and the penalties for committing the offence of concealing an offence differ from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. In England and all Australian jurisdictions except New South Wales, the offence of concealment of an offence is
only committed when the offender obtains or attempts to obtain a benefit of some kind in return for not disclosing the offence to
the police.
3.2 The Australian Capital Territory is the only Australian jurisdiction with no offence equivalent to
However, the Australian Capital Territory does have provisions dealing with aiding and abetting an offence and with accessories.
3.3 Section 5 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967
(Eng) provides:
Penalties for concealing offences or giving false information
5(1) Where a person has committed an arrestable offence, any other person who, knowing or believing that the offence or some other
offence has been committed, and that he has information which might be of material assistance in securing the prosecution or conviction
of an offender for it, accepts or agrees to accept for not disclosing that information any consideration other than the making good
of loss or injury caused by the offence, or the making of reasonable compensation for that loss or injury, shall be liable on conviction
on indictment to imprisonment for not more than two years.
(3) No proceedings shall be instituted for an offence under this section except with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
3.4 The English provision applies to the concealment of “arrestable offence(s)”. “(A)rrestable offence” includes
all offences for which the sentence is fixed by law; offences carrying a sentence of five years’ imprisonment for a first conviction;
and numerous offences under a wide variety of prescribed legislation, including customs and excise offences, offences under England’s
official secrets legislation, and offences relating to the publication of obscene material and carrying offensive weapons.
The scope of s 5 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967
(Eng) is much broader than the obligation to disclose information about “serious offences” imposed by s 316.
3.5 In England, the offence of concealing an offence is only committed when the defendant accepts or agrees to accept consideration
for not disclosing information about the offence. Section 316 contains a similar offence
, but also creates an offence where a crime is concealed without any benefit accruing.
3.6 Section 5 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967
(Eng) provides guidance as to the meaning of “consideration” in the section. Making good the loss or injury caused by
the offence or compensation for that loss or injury does not constitute consideration. This also applies in New South Wales.
3.7 There is no equivalent in s 316 to the prerequisite in s 5 of
the Criminal Law Act 1967
(Eng) that the Director of Public Prosecutions consent to all prosecutions under s 5 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967
3.8 Unlike s 316, s 5 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967
(Eng) does not contain an exception where the defendant has a reasonable excuse for failure to disclose an offence to the police.
3.9 The penalty for committing an offence under the English provision is imprisonment for a maximum of two years. This is identical
to the penalty imposed by s 316(1), but considerably less than the penalty imposed by s 316(2), which is actually equivalent to s
Criminal Law Act 1967
(Eng) in that it only applies where the defendant accepts or agrees to accept a benefit for concealing an offence. The penalty imposed
by s316(2) is imprisonment for five years.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
3.10 There appears to be no offence of concealment of an offence in South Australia.
Section 241
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA) provides:
Impeding investigation of offences or assisting offenders
241(1) Subject to subsection (2), a person (“the accessory”) who, knowing or believing that another person (“the
principal offender”) has committed an offence, does an act with the intention of -
(a) impeding investigation of the offence; or
(b) assisting the principal offender to escape apprehension or prosecution or to dispose of proceeds of the offence,
is guilty of an offence.
(2) An accessory is not guilty of an offence against subsection (1) –
(a) unless it is established that the principal offender committed -
(i) the offence that the accessory knew or believed the principal offender to have committed; or
(ii) some other offence committed in the same, or partly the same, circumstances; or
(b) if there is lawful authority or reasonable excuse for the accessory’s action.
This is a true accessory after the fact offence.
Section 241
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA) applies to the concealment of all types of offences, unlike s 316 which is restricted to the concealment of serious offences.
3.12 The language used in
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA) is different to the language of s 316. Section 316(1) focuses on the defendant’s state of mind. It refers to the defendant
knowing or believing that a serious offence has been committed, but failing to bring information about the offence to the authorities.
Section 241
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA) emphasises the steps taken by the defendant to conceal the offence. It requires that the defendant “does an act”
with the intention of impeding the investigation of the offence or the apprehension or prosecution of the offender. This element
is required by the South Australian provision in addition to the requirement that the defendant knew or believed that an offence
had occurred.
Section 241
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA) specifically provides that where a person is found not guilty of the principal offence but the court is satisfied that another
person was guilty of the principal offence, the court may still find the accessory guilty of an offence under s 214.
9CHP3_7" href="#fnDP39CHP3_7">
The South Australian provision also provides that a defendant may be convicted of an accessory offence committed outside South Australia
if the court has jurisdiction to deal with the principal offence.
Section 316 does not deal with these issues.
3.14 The penalties for committing an offence under
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA) are staggered between two years’ and ten years’ imprisonment, depending on the sentence committed for the principal
The penalties under s 316 are not linked to the concealed offence in this way. Instead, in s 316, the penalty is increased from imprisonment
for two years to imprisonment for five years where the defendant accepts or agrees to accept any benefit in consideration for concealing
the offence. This reflects the fact that it is considered to be a more serious offence to receive a benefit in return for concealing
an offence.
Section 241
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA) does not refer to the situation where a defendant receives a benefit in return for concealing the principal offence.
3.15 In 1992 there were two prosecutions in the Local Courts under
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
(SA). There were no prosecutions in the higher courts in 1992. Between 1993 and 1996 in the Local Courts there was an average of
29 convictions per year. In 43% of cases between 1992 and 1996, no penalty was imposed on the convicted offender. Fines were imposed
in almost 15% of cases. Suspended prison sentences were imposed in a further 15% of cases. Community service orders were imposed
in almost 13% of cases. Imprisonment was imposed in less than 10% of cases. In the higher courts in the same period there was an
average of 9 convictions per year. In over 28% of these cases, no penalty was imposed on the convicted offender. Imprisonment accounted
for over 28% of penalties and suspended prison sentences accounted for 22% of penalties. Bonds were imposed in over 16% of cases.
Section 326(1)
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic) provides:
Concealing offences for benefit
326(1) where a person has committed a serious indictable offence, any other person who, knowing or believing that the offence, or
some other serious indictable offence, has been committed and that he has information which might be of material assistance in securing
the prosecution or conviction of an offender for it, accepts any benefit for not disclosing that information shall be guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to level 8 imprisonment.
3.17 “Serious indictable offence” is defined as an indictable offence which is punishable on first conviction with imprisonment
of five years or more or life.
This is similar to the definition of “serious offence” for the purposes of
3.18 In Victoria, the offence of concealing an offence is only committed when the defendant accepts a benefit for not disclosing information
Section 316
contains a similar offence, but also creates an offence where a crime is concealed without any benefit accruing.
Section 326
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic) provides guidance as to the meaning of the term “accepts any benefit”. It provides that in relation to thefts,
criminal damage to property, similar and associated offences, no offence is committed if the only benefit accepted in return for
failing to disclose the offence is the making good of any loss or injury caused by the offence, or the provision of reasonable compensation
for the loss or injury.
In New South Wales, the provision that soliciting, accepting or agreeing to accept the making good of the loss or injury caused by
an offence or the making of reasonable compensation does not constitute a benefit, is not restricted to a particular group of offences.
Section 326
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic) also deems that a person accepts a benefit by accepting or agreeing to accept:
any benefit or advantage, or the promise of any benefit or advantage, either to himself or to another, whether or not the benefit
or advantage is in money or money’s worth.
There is no equivalent provision defining the term “benefit” in
Section 326
also states that “benefit” for the purposes of
can accrue to the defendant or to any other person.
This is also the position in New South Wales.
3.22 Unlike
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic) does not contain an exception where the defendant has a reasonable excuse for concealing information about an offence from
the police.
3.23 The penalty for committing an offence under
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic), one year’s imprisonment, is considerably lower than the penalty of five years’ imprisonment prescribed for the
offence of concealing an offence for a benefit under
QUEENSLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND NORTHERN TERRITORY
3.24 Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have all adopted a similar formulation for the offence of compounding
or concealing crimes. The offence is contained in the
Criminal Code Act 1899
(Qld) s 133; the
Criminal Code Compilation Act 1913
(WA) s 136 and the
Criminal Code Act 1983
(NT) s 104.
3.25 The offence in these jurisdictions provides:
Any person who asks, receives, or obtains, or agrees or attempts to receive or obtain, any property or benefit of any kind for himself,
herself or any other person, upon any agreement or understanding that the person will compound or conceal a crime, or will abstain
from, discontinue, or delay, a prosecution for a crime, or will withhold any evidence thereof, is guilty of an indictable offence.
3.26 This section applies to the concealment of all types of crimes, compared to s 316 which is restricted to the concealment of serious
3.27 In Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory the offence of concealing an offence
is only committed when the defendant asks for, receives, or agrees or attempts to receive property or a benefit for not concealing
the crime. Section 316 contains a similar offence, but also creates an offence when a crime is concealed without any benefit accruing.
3.28 The definition of benefit in these jurisdictions includes property and states that the property or benefit can accrue to the
defendant or to any other person. Section 316 also states that “benefit” for the purpose of s316(2) can accrue to the
defendant or to any other person.
3.29 Unlike s 316, the offence in these jurisdictions does not contain an exception where the defendant has a reasonable excuse for
concealing information about an offence from the police.
3.30 The penalties for committing an offence in these jurisdictions are staggered between three years’ and seven years’
imprisonment, depending on the sentence for the concealed offence.
This is also the approach taken in the South Australian provision.
The penalties under s 316 are not linked to the concealed offence in this way.
3.31 In Queensland, the offender can not be arrested without a warrant.
3.32 There have been no prosecutions under the Queensland provision in the last ten years and there is no record of any prosecution
under the Northern Territory provision. There have been two convictions under the Western Australian provision. In both cases, the
offender pleaded guilty and was fined $2000.00.
3.33 Section 58 of the
Criminal Code Act 1924
(Tas) contains a concealment offence which is limited to the concealment of treason.

Discussion Paper 39 (1997) - Review of Section 316 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)
4. Reform of Section 316
History of this Reference (Digest)
ARGUMENTS FOR RETAINING SECTION 316
4.1 There are clear arguments for retaining s 316 in its current form. These arguments focus on the social utility of the section.
4.2 It is argued that the section serves a valid social purpose, which is to encourage members of the public to report information
4.3 It has also been suggested that the offence serves a useful purpose by facilitating plea bargaining.
However, the data on prosecutions under s 316 does not support this argument. Of 85 cases under s 316 in the Local Courts in the
period June 1992 to May 1997, four defendants were charged with multiple counts. Of 34 cases under s 316 in the higher courts in
the period January 1990 to December 1996, no defendants were charged with multiple counts.
The section may also be used by the police as a plea bargaining tool in the sense that it is presented to suspects as a lesser offence
than the alternative charges the police can choose from.
ARGUMENTS FOR REFORM OF SECTION 316
4.4 There are strong arguments for the reform of s 316. These arguments focus on the scope of offences covered by the section, civil
libertarian concerns, the impact of the section on professional and personal confidential relationships and the relationship of s
316 and the law relating to the right to silence and privilege against self incrimination.
Scope of s 316
4.5 It is argued that the unreasonably wide scope of s 316 has the potential to bring the criminal law into disrepute. The section
makes it an offence to fail to disclose a “serious offence”, which is defined as an offence punishable by at least five
years’ imprisonment.
However, many submissions suggested that the community would consider that it was absurd to require disclosure of many offences which
technically fall within this definition. For example, a boy who gives his mate a “leg up” in an attempt to climb a brick
wall into enclosed lands with intent to steal a horse commits a “serious offence”.
Civil libertarian concerns
4.6 One submission characterised the offence created by s 316 as nonfeasance, distinguishing it from misfeasance, such as the active
suppression of information, or active assistance of an offender to escape detection.
Civil libertarians argue that it is oppressive to make it a crime for a person to hold a particular state of mind, even where the
person has not done any act to conceal an offence. It is argued that this extends criminal liability too far from the criminal act
4.7 A related civil libertarian argument is that the obligation to disclose information about the commission of serious offences to
the police imposed by s 316 makes everyone in the community agents of “big brother” - an unreasonable interference by
the state into the freedom of individuals to decide whether or not to participate in the legal framework of society.
Levels of cooperation with the police cease to be a measure of whether particular laws really reflect what the community wants in
the context of an obligation to report “serious offences” to the police.
Effect on confidential relationships
4.8 Section 316 has been criticised because it imposes an obligation to report serious offences disclosed in the course of confidential
relationships. This obligation is inconsistent with the widely accepted principle, which is based on the religious concept of confession,
that offenders should be able to discuss their woes with another without fear of betrayal of confidence.
Many submissions argued that the obligation imposed by s 316 undermines these relationships by destroying confidentiality between
the parties.
Lawyer/client relationship
4.9 This argument has been raised in relation to the relationship between lawyers and their clients. It has been suggested that the
doctrine of legal professional privilege may not be sufficient to protect a legal practitioner who is charged under s 316.
Case law on the scope of the common law offence of misprision of felony suggests that legal professional privilege may be a reasonable
excuse for the purpose of s 316.
However there is no case law on the relationship of s 316 and the doctrine of legal professional privilege, although a similar attitude
would be expected to be taken.
Law enforcement agencies/informers
4.10 A similar argument has been raised in by law enforcement agencies, which obtain information about the commission of offences
from informers. It is argued that although a potential witness is unlikely to be prosecuted under s 316, the possibility alone is
a disincentive to informers to cooperate with law enforcement agencies.
The problem is exacerbated for investigators and interviewers who consider that they are compelled to caution potential witnesses
This problem can only exist in relation to informers who are potential witnesses. It must be recognised that many informers merely
acquire knowledge of offences through others and are not witnesses to offences.
Health care professionals, counsellors/patients
4.11 Relationships between health care professionals, including medical practitioners, nurses, counsellors and educators and their
patients are also based on confidentiality. It is argued that the existence of s 316 will deter patients from approaching such professionals
for medical advice or counselling when doing so will necessitate revealing the commission of a serious offence by or against the
Similar considerations may apply to some youth workers and social workers.
4.12 This problem can arise in many situations. For example, a person may approach a medical practitioner seeking advice on safe sexual
practices, revealing that the client or the client’s sexual partner is under the age of consent. A person may approach a drugs
counsellor seeking information on safer injecting drug use or information about drug addiction and reveal that he or she or another
person possesses a quantity of a prohibited drug. A person may approach a medical practitioner for treatment of injuries and reveal
that they have been a victim of an assault. The same person may reveal the commission of the assault against them to a school counsellor.
As with law enforcement agencies, the problem is exacerbated for health care professionals and counsellors who consider that they
are compelled to caution clients in advance that if they disclose information about serious offences, it will be reported.
4.13 A related issue is the potential application of s 316 to people in “quasi-counselling” positions such as sports coaches
and teachers.
Researchers/subjects
4.14 This issue has also been raised by researchers who argue that compliance with the obligation to report serious offences imposed
by s 316 would inhibit legal, medical and social research.
Again, this can arise in many contexts.
4.15 Legal research into criminal activity may involve interviewing offenders, witnesses and victims of crime as well as observing
people involved in criminal activity. Illegal behaviour which may include serious offences may also come to light indirectly in medical
and social studies where it is not the primary focus.
There are clear problems with the potential legal liability of researchers in relation to information about serious offences acquired
during the course of research. University and other institutional ethics committees who approve research projects generally require
consent from research subjects after proper explanation. Informing research subjects that the information which they provide may
be reported to authorities is likely to be a significant impediment to participation in research and is also likely to undermine
trust between the researcher and the research subject.
4.16 Although the exercise of prosecutorial discretion may ensure that researchers are not charged under s 316, the potential legal
liability of the researcher, the university and its officers, and the fact that this will undermine the institution’s insurance
coverage means that approval may be withheld.
Medical and social research and research into criminal behaviour and its control, which is of considerable social utility in developing
public strategies to reduce the harms associated with crime, is threatened by the existence of s 316.
Family and friends
4.17 Section 316 imposes an obligation to report serious offences on the offender’s family. Such an obligation is in conflict
with their role within the family and may harm the relationship of family members.
For example, parents who know or believe that their child has committed a serious offence are required by s 316 to inform the police
of any information which might assist in securing the apprehension or conviction of their child. This would also apply to spouses.
Complying with the disclosure obligation imposed by s 316 would severely strain, and may well destroy, these relationships. One submission
queried whether, if there are multiple witnesses in one family to a “serious offence”, the obligation to report continues
once one family member reports the offence to the police.
In this context, family can have many different meanings. Similar objections to the scope of s 316 apply in relation to close friends
of the offender.
4.18 However, it is also arguable that in the case of serious offences such as domestic violence and sexual assault occurring within
the family, it is appropriate that the obligation to report offences should outweigh protection of the family relationship.
Residential care facilities
4.19 One submission also noted the possibility that people with intellectual disability living in residential facilities could be
charged for not reporting an offence they witnessed against another resident.
4.20 Finally, s 316 may be wide enough to impose an obligation to report serious offences on victims of crime. It is argued that this
is unacceptable because victims should be entitled to exercise their own judgment in deciding not to report offences committed against
them and may have many valid reasons for choosing not to inform the authorities.
One submission also argued that the section deprives victims of offences such as domestic violence of the capacity to use the threat
of reporting the offender as a way of negotiating escape from a violent relationship.
4.21 The relationship between s 316, the pre trial right of silence and the privilege against self incrimination is not clear. In
disclosing information about an offence committed by a third person, a person may incriminate themselves about an offence they have
committed. For example, a person may acquire information about illegal drug trafficking in the course of purchasing and using illegal
drugs. Is the person entitled to rely on the privilege against self incrimination in this situation to avoid the obligation to report
information in relation to the offence committed by the third person? There is authority that at common law the pre trial right of
silence prevailed over the offence of misprision of felony.
This position has been criticised on the basis that it may lead to injustice where there is a gross discrepancy between the magnitude
of the concealed offence and the insignificance of the apprehended prosecution. For example, where disclosing information about a
murder would incriminate the informant as having been driving without a licence, it is argued that giving ascendancy to the right
to silence produces injustice.
4.22 However, there is no case law on the relationship between s 316 and the right to silence. One submission suggested that an accomplice
or accessory would be guilty of an offence under s 316 when exercising the right not to answer police questions which may lead to
his or her own conviction.
4.23 A technical problem related to the operation of the privilege against self incrimination is that where an accused has had knowledge
or a belief about the commission of a serious offence for some time, the disclosure of that information will incriminate the accused
in respect of the concealment itself.
OPTIONS FOR REFORM
4.24 A number of submissions argued that the solution to the problems with s 316 discussed at paras 4.4 to 4.23 was abolition of the
This position is justified on the basis that the offence is rarely used
and that courts have rarely imposed significant penalties on offenders.
Related to this argument is the suggestion that s 316 is, or could be, used oppressively where prosecuting authorities know that
a person was involved in an offence but are unable to prove the nature of the person’s involvement, and to “target”
families of offenders known to the police.
4.25 It is also argued that the section has minimal deterrent value,
and that there are other offences which adequately cover blameworthy activity of this type.
Define “reasonable excuse”
4.26 One submission observed that uncertainty as to the meaning of “reasonable excuse” in s 316 is a major fault with
the current provision.
Arguably, the exception where the accused had a “reasonable excuse” for not disclosing information about a serious offence
to the police protects the groups of people referred to at paras 4.8 to 4.20.
However, there is no case law on this point. In relation to research work, concern has been expressed that the criteria used to determine
what is reasonable from a research ethics perspective may be different from the criteria used in the exercise of a discretion to
prosecute or in determining the outcome of a prosecution under s 316.
This concern could also apply to relatives of offenders and victims of offences.
4.27 To remove doubt, it has been suggested that the term “reasonable excuse” be defined to provide that people in particular
professional relationships have a “reasonable excuse” for concealing information about serious offences acquired in the
course of those relationships.
Alternatively, one submission suggested that the section should be amended to clearly separate “reasonable excuse” as
a statutory defence, to be made out on the balance of probabilities.
4.28 This approach does not protect family and friends of offenders or victims of offences from committing an offence under s 316
if they fail to disclose their knowledge of serious offences.
4.29 Another disadvantage of this approach is that the process of prescribing particular professions is complex and inflexible mechanism
for protecting confidential relationships from the operation of s 316. It is not possible to predict the range of institutions, students,
agencies, commercial organisations, community based groups and independent consultants likely to acquire information about serious
offences in the course of confidential relationships.
Requiring the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or Attorney General
4.30 In England no proceedings can be instituted under s 5 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967
(Eng) without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1997
(NSW) adopts a narrower version of this requirement. It requires the Attorney General’s consent to prosecutions under s 316
of persons who acquire knowledge of a serious offence in the course of practising or following a profession, calling or vocation
to be prescribed by regulation.
Although this approach would reduce the number of prosecutions under s 316 which require the Attorney General’s consent, there
are difficulties with relying on a prescribed list of exempted relationships.
Submissions by academics argued that incorporating a high level discretion is not adequate to protect their interests because the
problem faced by researchers is the theoretical possibility of prosecution which is taken into consideration by ethics committees.
Restricting offence to benefit situations
4.32 Restricting the operation of s 316 to situations where the accused accepts or agrees to accept a benefit in return for not disclosing
information to the police or other authorities would exempt the groups of people identified at 4.8 to 4.20 above from the operation
of the section. This approach was suggested by a number of submissions.
4.33 A number of submissions also argued that while there are strong arguments for the abolition of s 316(1), the behaviour criminalised
by s 316(2) is much more serious, which warrants retaining this arm of the offence.
4.34 Comparable offences in England, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory restrict the offence of concealing
an offence to situations where the accused obtains a benefit in return for not disclosing the offence.
This was the offence initially recommended for New South Wales.
However, following lobbying from the Police Service and Police Association, s 316 was enacted in its current form.
4.35 Care needs to be taken in relation to the form of words used to describe an offence which is restricted in this way. Concern
has been expressed that the expression currently used in s 316(2), “(a) person who solicits, accepts or agrees to accept any
benefit for himself or herself or any other person in consideration” for committing an offence under s 316(1), is too broad.
It has been suggested that the social utility of research referred to in para 4.16 may fall within the scope of s316(2).
Similarly, it has been suggested that it is necessary to make clear that earning an academic or other professional salary does not
constitute a relevant benefit.
One submission suggested that “benefit” to a person for the purposes of s 316 should include avoiding an investigation
into an incident involving that person.
Amend definition of “serious offence”
4.36 One submission suggested that s 316 should only apply to the concealment of serious offences which can only be dealt with on
indictment.
Another alternative would be to redefine “serious offence” so that only offences carrying a penalty of, say, seven years
or more constituted “serious offences” for the purposes of s 316.
Require intent
4.37 One submission argued that s 316 should only criminalise wilful or intentional concealment of information when called upon to
reveal it by the police.
However, the offence of wilfully obstructing a police officer executing his or her duties already exists in this situation.
4.38 There are considerable discrepancies between the penalty for breach of s 316(1), which is imprisonment for two years, and the
penalties under the equivalent provisions in other jurisdictions, which vary from imprisonment for one year to imprisonment for 10
4.39 In fact, the imposition of prison sentences on offenders under s 316 is rare.
It has been suggested the reluctance of magistrates and judges to impose prison sentences on offenders relates to the selective use
of s 316 by prosecuting authorities.
It has also been suggested that the imposition of a custodial sentence for the commission of an offence under s316(1) is inappropriate.
4.40 Section 316 has a valid social purpose of encouraging members of the public who have information about serious crimes to report
that information to the police and other appropriate authorities. However, the technical application of s 316(1) to information acquired
in the course of confidential relationships, including relationships between law enforcement agencies and informants, health care
professionals and patients and researchers and research subjects inhibits participation in these relationships. This problem outweighs
the social utility of s 316(1).
4.41 The Commission is satisfied that s 316 in its present form is unsatisfactory. If its retention at all can be justified in the
face of the arguments stated above, some amendments are required at least to clarify problems arising from the present wording and
to preserve the interests of lawyers, medical practitioners and others whose services are considered socially valuable. The Commission
therefore makes alternative proposals and seeks comment upon them:
OPTION 1 - ABOLISH S 316
Section 316 should be abolished. The terms of the section are so wide that it intrudes into a range of confidential relationships.
The social utility of the section is outweighed by the potential for harm to these valuable relationships.
OPTION 2 - BENEFIT ONLY OFFENCE
Section 316 should be amended so that the offence is only made out when the defendant accepts or agrees to accept a benefit in money
or money’s worth in return for failing to disclose an offence.
OPTION 3 - SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS
Section 316 should be amended to provide that legal practitioners, medical practitioners / counsellors / psychologists / social workers
and priests who acquire information about “serious offences” in the course of their profession or vocation are not guilty
of an offence for failing to disclose it, in accordance with the doctrine of privilege. The section should also be amended to provide
that engaging in genuine research constitutes a reasonable excuse for concealment of information about serious offences from the
