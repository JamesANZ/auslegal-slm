On 1 May 2025, the landlords applied to Consumer
Protection for approval to refuse the tenant’s request.

premises are unsuitable for keeping the requested pet.

As a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the
evidence relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for

In the landlords’ application, it is stated that the premises are
unsuitable due to the backyard being fully paved with no

fencing and open spaces.
of any grassed area in the backyard does not make the premises are unsuitable
for keeping the requested pet.
Research conducted by Consumer Protection shows the premises is a four bedroom,
two-bathroom home with a fully fenced backyard and
protection from the elements
for the requested pet.
Considering the information from the landlords and the tenant, I am not
satisfied that the premises are unsuitable for keeping the
requested pet.
Is keeping the requested pet at the premises likely to cause damage to the
premises that could not be repaired for less than the bond?
The security bond held by the Bond Administrator for this premises is $2200.
In written submissions, the landlords stated that the requested pet has caused
the following damage:
Rips in the fly
screen door.
Faeces on pavers
causing stains.
A photograph of the rips to the fly screen door was submitted by the landlords.
There is no evidence of the cost to repair to the
flyscreen door, but it would
clearly not exceed the security bond.
The landlords submitted non-dated photographs depicting faeces on the pavers for
the home open of the premises. There is no evidence
of staining to the pavers or
the cost to repair should any staining occur.
No evidence has been provided by the landlords to show how the requested pet
will damage the premises exceeding the security bond
The tenant has an obligation to ensure that the premises are left in as close as
possible to the same condition compared to when
they moved in, less any fair
wear and tear.
This cannot be
determined until the end of the tenancy.
In the tenant’s application, a plan to train and care for the requested
pet was submitted.
Considering the information from the landlords and the tenant, I am not
satisfied that keeping the requested pet at the premises
is likely to cause
damage to the premises that could not be repaired for less than the bond.
Is keeping the requested pet at the premises likely to cause the landlord
undue hardship?
The term ‘undue hardship’ is not defined in the RTA.
The Macquarie Dictionary defines the terms as:
unwarranted; excessive; not proper, fitting or right; unjustified.
Hardship: a
condition that bears hard upon one; severe toil, trial, oppression or need.
The New South Wales Supreme Court has previously concluded that the phrase
“undue hardship” means “greater hardship
circumstances warrant”.
It was stated on the pet request form that the landlords are “quite
stressed about the situation” due to the pavers not
being cleaned and the
damage to the fly screen door evident when there was a home open to sell the
The RTA outlines the tenant’s responsibilities:
the tenant shall
not intentionally; or
negligently
cause or permit damage to the
The RTA similarly outlines tenant responsibilities for keeping a pet:
the tenant is
responsible for nuisance caused by a pet; and
repairing damage
caused by a pet.
The tenant’s written submission states the landlords approved the
requested pet in person and then declined approval a few
days later. The
landlords had the opportunity to decline the request prior to the requested pet
being brought onto the premises.
No evidence has been provided by the landlords to show that the requested pet
would cause damage that would meet the definition of
undue hardship.
Considering the information from the landlords and the tenant, I am not
satisfied that keeping the requested pet at the premises
is likely to cause the
landlord undue hardship.
A tenant or landlord who is dissatisfied with this decision can appeal to the
