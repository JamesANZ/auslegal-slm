REASONS FOR DECISION:
Introduction
This is a claim by the Applicant for
interest upon an amount owing under a building contract. The quantum of the
Applicant’s
claim is set out in material filed in the Tribunal on 7 March
2003. The total interest claimed by the Applicant against the Respondent
$35,549.37.
The Respondent does not take issue with
the Applicant’s interest calculations, nor does the Respondent contest
that the Applicant’s
claim for interest is pursuant to Clause 10.4 of the
building contract entered into between
Submissions
The Respondent submits however
I have a discretion (presumably pursuant
to section 95(4) of the
Queensland Building Services Authority Act 1991
(“the Act”) as in force at the date of commencement of this
application) as to whether to award interest in any application
no matter upon
what basis the claim for interest was brought.
The Applicant’s conduct generally
during the course of the application (in terms of its abandonment and success on
various heads
of claim) was such that my discretion should be exercised against
the Applicant upon its interest claim.
A written offer was made by the
Respondent by letter dated 28 June 2000, and that the Applicant failed to
recover an amount in excess
of that offer. By reason of this again I should
exercise my discretion against the Applicant in respect of its interest
In view of the Applicant’s conduct
aforesaid and the letter of offer, the term in the contract giving rise to the
Applicant’s
contractual claim for interest should be avoided. This is
pursuant to section 95(4)(d) of the Act.
In response the Applicant submits
The power given in section 95(4) of the
Act to award interest is not a discretionary power in the sense that term might
be applicable
to an award for costs, but is, if it is to be regarded as a
“discretion” at all, a “discretion” to decide
solely according to the legal principles involved.
The offer in the Respondent’s
letter of 28 June 2000 is an “all up” offer. Interest is not a
discrete item in the
offer. The offer therefore must include any interest
factor. In any event the amount offered, namely $20,000, is neither equal
nor does it exceed, the amount recovered by the Applicant which Mr Burnett of
Counsel for the Applicant assessed in respect of
Coolden in an amount in the
order of $41,200. Accordingly, even if there was a discretion in the Tribunal
in respect of interest,
as the Respondent submits, that discretion should not,
on the basis of the quantum of the offer and the amount recovered by the
be exercised in favour of the Respondent.
The nature of the offer (including as it
does undetermined costs in three (3) Supreme Court Chamber applications both for
and against
each of the parties and upon which no particularity was provided) is
so indefinite as to quantum (other than the $20,000 noted) as
to not allow any
arithmetical determination as to the actual amount being
In respect of (c) above I note that,
during the course of the Respondent’s own submissions, Mr Forde of Counsel
for the Respondent
suggested that, with the off-setting of costs in the Supreme
Court actions, the Respondent’s offer would probably approach
$35,000. I note further that this amount remains less than the amount which,
upon Mr Burnett’s assessment, the Applicant
recovered, namely
I should yet further note that Mr
Forde’s response to this was that he anticipated (yet to be argued) costs
orders in this application
would favour the Respondent:
Which would accordingly further increase
the amount of the Respondent’s offer to beyond $30,000 or $35,000;
by reason of a recent Court of Appeal
Elphick -v- Elliott
[2002] QSC 285
such costs could be set off
against damages (by way of interest) due to the Applicant to arrive at a net
On the assumption that the
Respondent’s submission is correct, namely that I have the
“discretion” suggested, I
consider that:
the 28 June 2000 offer is, as the
Applicant submits, incapable of being calculated as to amount, beyond that is
the $20,000 specifically
in any event there is no particularity
upon which I could reasonably attempt that exercise;
on the information available it has not
been established on the balance of probabilities that the Respondent’s
offer exceeds
the amount recovered by the Applicant.
Again based upon the above assumption, I
consider that the Applicant’s “conduct” is reflected in the
amount recovered
which, in turn, will reflect not only in the level of costs
that it will recover, but also the interest to which it will be entitled.
such it would not ordinarily be a discretionary factor to be further taken to
account in my view. I should say no more than
that, as it is anticipated that
there will be a further contest as to costs.
Having made these comments primarily I
consider that the power in section 95 to award (Mr Forde adds, not award)
interest is not in
the nature of a “discretion” as the Respondent
submits, but is, again as the Applicant submits, a power to be exercised
according to the contractual rights and liabilities of the parties, in this case
pursuant to the subject building contract and, more
particularly, Clause 10.4 of
that contract. It is then simply a contractual matter to be approached based
upon the legal principles
The Applicant is entitled to interest
under the contract pursuant to Clause 10.4. That entitlement (it is common
ground) is calculated
by the Applicant to be $35,549.37 (including both the
“Coolden” and “Verandahs” projects). If the Respondent
wished to avoid the imposition of the contractual term as to interest, it was
open to the Respondent to have paid an amount to the
Applicant, thereby stopping
interest running. It chose not to do so.
I should answer as well the
Respondent’s submission that this was an appropriate circumstance for me
to avoid the term in the
contract relating to interest. In my view the subject
term is not an unjust contractual term, even given the circumstances as the
Respondent interprets them. Further, in my view, the application of the
interest provision in the building contract does not invoke
any injustice to the
Respondent for the reasons already noted. Indeed the Respondent was well aware
that there was such a term,
and that interest was running. Further the
Respondent has had the benefit of the monies not paid and, alternatively the
has been kept out of its money payable by the Respondent under the
building contract.
In all the circumstances I consider that
the Applicant is entitled to recover by way of interest the total sum of
$35,549.37.
Accordingly I order that the Respondent
pay to the Applicant within 28 days from the date of this order the sum of
$35,549.37, failing
which the Respondent will pay interest at the rate of 10%
per annum on so much of that sum as shall remain unpaid until it is
