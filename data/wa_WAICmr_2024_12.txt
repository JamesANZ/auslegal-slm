Decision D0122024 – Published in note form only
Malik and Main Roads Western Australia
[2024] WAICmr
Date of Decision: 30 August 2024
Information Act 1992
Schedule 1, clause 3
November 2022, Dalbir Singh Malik (
complainant
applied to Main Roads Western Australia (
) under the
Freedom of Information Act 1992
) for access to documents relating to the investigation of
allegations the complainant made to the agency. Relevantly, the investigation
was carried out by an external organisation and found that all but one of the
complaints were not substantiated.
By notice of decision dated 23
November 2022, the agency refused the complainant access to two documents,
referred to as the Draft
Report and the Final Report, pursuant to clauses
11(1)(c) and 8(2) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act. The complainant applied for
review of the agency’s decision and claimed that there were
additional documents within the scope of his access application.
13 December 2022, the agency confirmed its decision to refuse access
to the Draft Report and the Final Report. The agency also
refused access to
additional documents, under section 26 of the FOI Act, on the basis that they
did not exist.
The complainant contested the agency’s internal
review decision that no additional documents exist. On 25 January 2023, the
agency purported to provide the complainant with an amended internal review
decision. The agency’s purported decision confirmed
the decision to
refuse access to the Draft Report and the Final Report and located one
additional document, referred to as the Engagement
Agreement (together,
disputed documents
). The agency refused access to the
Engagement Agreement, pursuant to clauses 11(1)(c), 3(1) and 4(2) of Schedule 1
to the FOI Act.
On 30 January 2023, the complainant applied to the
Information Commissioner (
the Commissioner
) for external review of the
agency’s decision to refuse access to the disputed documents. The
Commissioner obtained the disputed
documents from the agency, together with the
FOI file maintained in respect of the access application.
external review, the agency gave the complainant edited access to the Engagement
Agreement and informed the complainant
that it considered that the Draft Report
and Final Report are also exempt under clause 3(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act
clause 3(1)
The complainant was not satisfied with the access
provided. The complainant claimed that the Draft Report and the Final Report
not exempt as claimed by the agency and that there was an additional
document within the scope of his access application.
On 3 July 2024, the
Acting Information Commissioner (
A/Commissioner
) considered all of the
material before her and provided the parties with her preliminary view. In
addition to providing her preliminary
view as to whether there were further
documents within the scope of the access application, the A/Commissioner was of
the preliminary
view that the Final Report is exempt under clause 3(1). In
light of her view, it was not necessary to consider whether the Final
also exempt under clause 11(1)(c) and 8(2) as claimed by the agency.
The complainant did not accept the preliminary view that the Final
the disputed document
) is exempt under clause 3(1) and provided
further submissions. The complainant submitted that disclosure of the disputed
was in the public interest.
After considering all of the
material before her, including the complainant’s further submissions, the
Commissioner agreed with
the A/Commissioner’s preliminary view.
Clause 3(1) provides that matter is exempt if its disclosure would
reveal personal information about an individual (whether living
Personal information is exempt under clause 3(1) subject to the application of
the limits on the exemption set out in
clauses 3(2) to 3(6). Relevantly, clause
3(6) provides that personal information will not be exempt if its disclosure
balance, be in the public interest. Under section 102(3) of the FOI
Act, the complainant bears the onus of establishing that it
would, on balance,
be in the public interest to disclose personal information about other
individuals.
Having examined the disputed document, the Commissioner was
satisfied that it contained personal information, as defined in the FOI
that the disputed document was on its face, exempt in its entirety under clause
In considering whether disclosure of the personal information in
the disputed document would, on balance, be in the public interest
pursuant to
clause 3(6), the Commissioner did not accept the complainant’s submission
that personal privacy is not applicable
to individuals who are officers of
government agencies. The Commissioner considered that, in circumstances where
the personal information
under clauses 3(3) or 3(4), as was the case here, it is necessary to consider
whether disclosure of the personal information would, on balance, be in the
public interest.
The Commissioner considered the public interest in
maintaining personal privacy is a strong one and may only be displaced by some
other, strong public interest that requires the disclosure of personal
information about one person to another. Further, in cases
such as this, where
allegations have been made to a government agency and the ensuing investigations
have not resulted in formal
findings in relation to those allegations, the
Commissioner noted that there is a strong public interest in protecting the
of the persons the subject of the complaint: see
Re Ninan and
Department of Commerce
[2012] WAICmr
Re ‘K’ and Legal Practice Board
[2024] WAICmr
In balancing the competing public interests, the Commissioner was not
persuaded that the public interests favouring disclosure of
the disputed
document outweighed the strong public interest in the protection of personal
that the limit on the exemption in
clause 3(6) did not apply to the disputed document.
Accordingly, the
Commissioner found that the disputed document is exempt under clause 3(1) of
Schedule 1 to the FOI Act and varied
the agency’s decision.
