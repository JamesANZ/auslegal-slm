DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
On 27 February 2012
the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review.
28 February 2012
REASONS FOR DECISION
Walker and Ms White are the parents of Michael, born 2002 and Julie, born 2004.
The case was first registered with the Child Support
Agency (“the
Agency”) for assessment and collection on 27 February 2002. Mr Walker is
the parent liable to pay child
support to Ms White. The rate of child support
payable in the child support period commencing 1 December 2009 was $8664, based
Mr Walker’s adjusted taxable income of $55250, being his taxable income
for the 2008-2009 financial year.
11 October 2010 Mr Walker contacted the Agency and estimated that his adjusted
taxable income for the remainder of the 2010-2011
financial year would be $0.
The rate of child support was reassessed to take this into account with effect
from 11 October 2010,
which had the effect of reducing the annual rate to $2356
(the fixed annual rate). Mr Walker and Ms White were advised of this decision
by letters dated 13 October 2010. Mr Walker subsequently requested that the
fixed annual rate not apply. Mr Walker and Ms White
were notified by further
letters dated 2 December 2010 that the annual rate of child support had been
reduced to $356 (the minimum
annual rate) with effect from 11 October
18 November 2010 Ms White had lodged an objection to the decision to accept Mr
Walker’s income estimate of $0 for the period
11 October 2010 to 30 June
2011. On 17 January 2011 an objections officer of the Agency affirmed this
decision and notified the
parties. On 13 September 2011 Mr Walker contacted
the Agency and advised that he was still in receipt of newstart allowance. He
estimated that his 2011-2012 financial year adjusted taxable income would be
$12357. The rate of child support was reassessed
on the basis of this
income with effect from 13 September 2011. On 12 October 2011 Mr Walker
objected to this decision
on the basis that he had been in receipt of newstart
allowance since January 2011 however the rate of child support was based on
2009-2010 financial year adjusted taxable income of $59999 from 1 July 2011 to
12 September 2011.
7 December 2011 an objections officer of the Agency reviewed the decision to
accept the estimate of income with effect from 13
September 2011 and not 1 July
2011. The objections officer disallowed the objection on the basis that an
estimate of income may
only take effect from the day it is
23 December 2011 Mr Walker applied to this Tribunal for an independent review of
the Agency’s decision. The matter was heard
and determined on 27 February
issue to be determined in this case is whether it is correct to assess the rate
of child support payable in the period 1 July
2011 to 12 September 2011
(inclusive) on the basis of Mr Walker’s adjusted taxable income for the
2009-2010 financial year.
CONSIDERATION OF
Child Support (Assessment) Act
(“the Act”)
allows for a parent to estimate their financial year adjusted taxable income for
child support purposes.
subsection 60(1)
of the Act (attached), the
estimate can be made before or during a year of income. It is not disputed and
the Tribunal consequently
finds that Mr Walker made an estimate of adjusted
taxable income
for the 2010-2011 financial year
on 11 October 2010. The
rate of child support was then correctly assessed on the basis of this estimated
income from that date.
of the Act provides that the start date for an estimate election is the
day that the estimate was made or the first day of a child
support period,
whichever is the latter. Mr Walker made his estimate election on 11 October
2010. This was during the 2010-2011 financial
year therefore the estimate
related to income for the 2010-2011 financial year. Mr Walker was notified by
letter dated 13 October
2010 that this was the case and that the estimate of
income would be used in the assessment of child support until the end of the
estimate period.
terms of how long an estimate of income can be used for the assessment of the
child support,
of the Act (attached) provides that the period of
effect is called the application period. The application period commences on the
start date for the estimate election and ceases at “the end of the last
day of that year of income”. This means that
the estimate made by Mr
Walker on 11 October 2010 takes effect from 11 October 2010 to 30 June 2011
basis of Mr Walker’s case is that there had been no change to his
circumstances and that he was still in receipt of newstart
allowance as at 1
July 2011. He further submits that as the Agency and Centrelink communicate with
each other, it was apparent to
the Agency that he was still in receipt of
Centrelink payments. His final submission was that notices from the Agency
stipulate that
a person must notify of changes in their circumstances within 14
days. As there had been no change, there was no requirement for
him to contact
the Agency.
Tribunal accepts that Mr Walker remained in receipt of newstart allowance
however there is no basis under the law to treat his
estimate of 2010-2011
financial year income, which was made on 11 October 2010, as also being an
estimate of 2011-2012 financial
year income. Further to this,
section 60(7)
provides that the estimate must be made by the parent. Officers of the Agency do
not have the power to unilaterally change the assessment
of child support on
this basis.
is not disputed by Mr Walker and the Tribunal consequently finds that as at 1
July 2011 Mr Walker had not provided an estimate
of his 2011-2012 financial
year income.
He could have done this in accordance with
section 60(2)
the Act. In the absence of a valid estimate of income made by the parent, the
rate of child support reverted to that calculated
under the formula assessment,
which means that the rate was based on the 2009-2010 financial year adjusted
taxable income. In Mr
Walker’s case, this was $59999.
Walker then made an election to estimate his adjusted taxable income for the
2011-2012 financial year. That election was made on
13 September 2011. In
accordance with
section 60(5)
of the Act that election must take effect on the
day it is made. It is not possible for the estimate of income to be backdated to
1 July 2011 or any other date. As the income estimate was correctly applied by
the Agency with effect from 13 September 2011, the
Tribunal must affirm the
decision before it.
