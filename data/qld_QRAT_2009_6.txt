Matangi v Queensland Racing [2009] QRAT 6 (27 April 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
27 April 2009
Rachael Matangi
RESPONDENT:
Queensland Racing
APPEARANCES:
Rachael Matangi on her own behalf and Mr W Birch, steward on behalf of
Queensland Racing
REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield -
This is an appeal by Rachael Matangi against the severity of the penalty
imposed on her by stewards following a conviction under AR81A(1)(a).
circumstances leading to the conviction identify that the appellant is a track
work rider and together with a significant number
of track work riders was the
subject of testing procedures undertaken at the Gold Coast Turf Club on Monday
23 February 2009. The
sample provided by the appellant revealed the existence
of Sympathomimetic Amines. It appears that after her work chores for Saturday
had been completed she attended a nightclub in Surfers Paradise with other
associates in the racing industry and had a considerable
amount of alcohol.
When she determined to attend the racetrack for track work riding purposes on
Monday she was still suffering
the effects of what now appear to be a
recreational drug.
As a result the stewards determined that she be disqualified from holding a
licence to ride track work for a period of six months.
The stewards in their
deliberations asked if there were any issues that needed to be placed before
them that would enable them to
be lenient when imposing any penalty. To her
credit she provided information that identified her reliance on the racing
to a very large extent. The stewards considered that it was not proper
that the industry be lenient with persons who were in charge
of very dangerous
and highly trained thoroughbreds and considered that in all the circumstances a
period of six months disqualification
The appeal was lodged as a result of that imposition of penalty and this
Tribunal having heard the evidence considers that a period
of six months is more
than reasonable as one could easily identify having regard to similar type
occurrences and penalties imposed
in New South Wales and other states that a
significantly higher penalty could have been imposed. In the circumstances it
appropriate that the penalty be varied and this appeal is dismissed and
the deposit is forfeit.
