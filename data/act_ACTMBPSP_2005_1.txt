Dr IJ [2005] ACTMBPSP 1 (1 January 2005)
Medical Board of the Australian Capital Territory
Professional Standards Panel Outcomes
Following receipt of a report, the
Medical Board established a panel to inquire into allegations that Dr IJ
had supplied three
patients with prescriptions and referrals without
taking an adequate medical history; had claimed for a number of
consultations
in which Medicare was billed; and had failed to maintain
notes in relation to provision of prescriptions, referrals and other
consultations
with the three patients.
The panel conducted an Inquiry on 23 September 2005.
On the basis of the evidence before it, the panel decided that Dr
IJ had contravened
the required standard of practice, but that Dr IJ�s
conduct did not put public safety at risk. Accordingly, the Panel
decided that
it was appropriate to formally reprimand Dr IJ.
