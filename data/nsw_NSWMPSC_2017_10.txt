STATEMENT OF DECISION
Introduction
ur inquiry concerns the practice of Dr Khamis in the care of four of his
fter obtaining his medical degree from the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons in Ireland in 1975 Dr Baderudin Khamis undertook
his internship at St
Laurence’s Hospital in Dublin. For the next three years he worked in the
Department of Medicine at the
Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin. He migrated
to Australia in 1979 and became registered to practise medicine in New South
r Khamis commenced in a general practice in Wauchope and began his long
career looking after the local community. He secured an appointment
as Visiting
Medical Officer at Wauchope Hospital in 1980 working in casualty and attending
many of his patients. In November 2014
he received an award from the Rural
Doctors Association, acknowledging over 35 years of service to the rural
community. Dr
Khamis has a long and distinguished career serving the people of
Wauchope, and his many contributions should not be forgotten.
n 21 July 2017 Dr Khamis advised AHPRA that he had retired from medical
practice. On 28 July 2017 his name was removed from the register
practitioners, effective from 27 July 2017. Dr Khamis has told us he has no
intention of ever reapplying for registration.
n 12 October 2016 the Health Care Complaints Commission had made a
in accordance with s39(2) and s90B(3) of the
Health Care
Complaints Act
and s145A of the
Health Practitioner Regulation National
National Law
) alleging that Dr Khamis had been guilty
of unsatisfactory professional conduct in the treatment he afforded to four
patients, and
the records he kept, in different periods from 2013 through to
early 2015. The Complaint contained four distinct complaints, which
may be dealt
with together in the one inquiry (clause 6(1) of Schedule 5D of the National
n large part Dr Khamis acknowledges the Complaint and accepts he has been
guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct under ss139B(1)(a)
and (b) of the
National Law. Although Dr Khamis is presently not registered, we have decided to
make directions as to conditions
that are to be imposed were Dr Khamis to become
registered.
efore referring to the evidence, setting out our findings and giving reasons
for our decision we deal with particular matters that
arose during the course of
the proceedings.
Non-disclosure order
n 5 April 2017 the Chairperson directed that nothing that would identify the
four patients was to be published, and we refer to those
patients as Patient A,
Patient B, Patient C, and Patient D respectively. A similar order was made with
respect to a
former patient of Dr Khamis who had made a complaint on 17 January 2012 about
Dr Khamis (Exhibit A, Tab 1(d)). Those directions continue.
Application to terminate the inquiry
n 28 July 2017 Dr Khamis requested that the inquiry be terminated on the
grounds that his name had been removed from the register
on 27 July 2017. He had
no intention of again practising, given his age and health, and it was not in
the public interest for the
inquiry to continue. The application was made under
clause 12(1) of Schedule 5D of the National Law.
n 31 July 2017 the Commission wrote to the Medical Council of NSW opposing
the application, and providing further information concerning
Dr Khamis, some of
which was not immediately relevant to the Complaint.
he issues were considered during a telephone directions hearing with the
Chairperson at 2:30pm on 31 July 2017. By clause 12(3) an
application to
terminate an inquiry may be dealt with by Chairperson, and the decision is taken
to be an exercise of the power by
the Committee.
oth Dr Khamis and the Commission accepted that the application by Dr Khamis
could be considered on the basis of the correspondence
and the submissions made.
However, to the extent that the correspondence from the Commission referred to
matters that were not the
subject of the Complaint before the Committee those
matters were to be ignored, and they were not taken into account.
s Versace for Dr Khamis provided further information in relation to his
personal circumstances and confirmed that Dr Khamis had
no intention of
seeking reregistration. By clause 12(1)(a)(ii) and clause 12(1)(b) an inquiry
may be terminated if the practitioner
ceases to be registered and it is not in
the public interest for the inquiry to continue.
s Bayley, for the Commission, submitted that even though Dr Khamis was no
longer a registered health practitioner and was unlikely
to ever be registered,
there was no evidence to support a conclusion that it was ‘
public interest for the inquiry
... to continue’
. Ms Bayley drew the Chairperson’s
attention to the value of an inquiry providing general deterrence, see
Care Complaints Commission v Do
[2014] NSWCA 307
[35], and that an inquiry
might continue particularly in circumstances where there were factual disputes
Health Care Complaints Commission v Duggan
[2015] NSWCATOD 142.
f a practitioner is no longer registered then s146B(2) of the National Law
permits a Committee to direct that conditions be imposed
if the health
practitioner were registered. Under clause 12 of Schedule 5D(1)(b) an inquiry
may only be terminated if it were not
in the public interest for the
inquiry to continue. The mere fact of Dr Khamis no longer being registered
is not a basis
to terminate an inquiry. The information concerning Dr
Khamis’s health was not of a kind that suggested it would not be in
public interest to proceed.
n preparation for the inquiry Dr Khamis had submitted a response to the
Complaint in which he admitted many aspects of the subject
matter of the
Complaint, although there were still matters in dispute. If upon inquiry the
Complaint were established, then the Committee
could consider a direction to
impose conditions were Dr Khamis to become registered. The National Law provides
that the inquiry continue
unless not in the public interest.
ven if Dr Khamis did not become registered there is still benefit in the
public and the profession having access to a decision of
the Professional
Standards Committee that considers whether Dr Khamis’s alleged conduct
amounted to unsatisfactory professional
conduct. A direction concerning
conditions, if appropriate and imposed, could give guidance as to how issues of
this kind might be
he application to terminate the inquiry was refused.
pon the application being refused Ms Versace said she was obtaining further
instructions from Dr Khamis as to whether there would
be any further admissions
as to the subject matter of the Complaint. If there were to be further
admissions then the evidence to
be considered or tested by the Committee might
be more limited. If Dr Khamis were to make any further admissions then he was
to do so by noon on Friday, 4 August 2017.
ur inquiry took place on 15 August 2017.
Further admissions by Dr Khamis
t the commencement of the inquiry Mr Jackson for Dr Khamis provided us with a
further amended reply to the Complaint (which became
Exhibit D) and formally
made admissions on behalf of Dr Khamis in response to the Complaint. There was
little that was in contest
Dr Khamis’s conduct amounted to unsatisfactory professional conduct.
r Khamis did not attend the inquiry. He was not prevented from attending by
illness or other circumstance. We were told Dr Khamis
felt too ashamed to
attend, particularly as the Complaint came at the end of his long and
distinguished career. There was no application
for adjournment by Dr Khamis or
the Commission. The inquiry proceeded in his absence. We have relied upon the
material provided to
us along with the helpful and focussed submissions of Ms
Petrie for the Commission and Mr Jackson for Dr Khamis.
The documents provided to the Committee
e received two folders of material from the Commission (Exhibit 1) containing
matters relating to the Complaint including records
of proceedings under s150 of
the National Law heard on 6 May 2015 with a written decision of 18 August 2015
imposing conditions on
his practice. On 31 August 2015 Dr Khamis sought review
of conditions under s150A of the National Law, and we were provided with
related material including the reasons for the subsequent decision dated 23
December 2015. These conditions required Dr Khamis
to practise under
supervision, and he gave consent for the Medical Council to obtain information
from Medicare about Dr Khamis.
Included was a Neuropsychological report by Dr Stewart of 25 July 2015
(Exhibit 1, Tab 14) and a report from Dr Rosen, a neurologist,
September 2015 (Exhibit 1, Tab 18) – expressing different views as to
cognitive impairment, if any.
he folders included details of a patient complaint made in 2012, and
correspondence from the Medical Council of NSW warning Dr Khamis
careful with his medical records and to meet the requirements of the
Regulation.
he folders included a report from Dr Geraldine Duncan as an expert’s
assessment of Dr Khamis’s conduct. Dr Khamis did
not contest Dr
Duncan’s views, except as set out below.
s Petrie provided a chronology (Exhibit 2) but with redaction of some
information which was not immediately relevant.
s Petrie also sought to tender materials relating to recent proceedings
(under s150 of the National Law) that had taken place shortly
before Dr Khamis
sought his removal from the register. Aspects of that material had been
referred to in the redacted portion of
the chronology.
n support of the tender of the material, Ms Petrie said the material would be
relevant to the exercise of the powers under s146B of
the National Law upon
findings of unsatisfactory professional conduct. Mr Jackson submitted the
material was prejudicial and could
affect the Committee’s consideration of
whether there had been unsatisfactory professional conduct.
e did not receive the material at that stage but left it to the Commission to
retender the material on the question of exercise of
powers if the Committee
found that the Complaint was proved.
n behalf of Dr Khamis we received a folder (Exhibit A) containing a statement
of Dr Khamis dated 6 June 2017 with annexures, his initial
formal written
admissions and some references. We also received a statutory declaration of Dr
Khamis (Exhibit B) saying he had no
intention of ever reapplying for
registration, and a supplementary statement of Dr Khamis dated 4 August 2017
(Exhibit C) dealing
with circumstances of his recent removal from the register.
Importantly we were given the further amended formal reply to particulars
Complaint (Exhibit D).
The Complaint
he Complaint is set out at Annexure 2 to our decision but without the
schedule containing the names of Patient A, Patient B, Patient
C and Patient D.
The Complaint consists of four complaints in respect of the four patients, with
background circumstances for each.
The allegation is of unsatisfactory
professional conduct under s139B(1)(a) of the National Law in the treatment
afforded to each
patient and a related allegation of unsatisfactory professional
conduct under s139B(1)(b), being a contravention of Clause 7 and
Schedule 2 of
Health Practitioner Regulation (New South Wales) Regulation
respect of his record keeping.
y Exhibit D, Dr Khamis admitted the subject matter of the Complaint and that
he was guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct
in respect of the four
complaints. Nevertheless, in his reply he did not admit, or had had points to
make about the following alleged
particulars:
omplaint One A, paragraph 2(c) concerning Patient A’s doses of
Prednisone;
omplaint Three A, paragraph 1(b) in that he said he did discuss the listed
factors but had not made a record in the notes;
omplaint Three A, paragraph 2(b) in that iron and haemoglobin studies had
been ordered sufficiently regularly;
omplaint Four A, paragraph 1(a) in that he performed the heart rate and
rhythm, blood pressure and chest auscultation examinations
but failed to make a
record in his notes.
aking account of Dr Duncan’s report, the other documents provided by
the Commission, and the material from Dr Khamis, along
with the subsequent
discussions with the representatives for Dr Khamis and the Commission, we were
able to conclude that both parts
of each of the four complaints were proved,
even allowing for the issued raised by Dr Khamis. As explained below we came to
assessment of Dr Khamis’s conduct, and did not simply adopt Dr
Duncan’s views, even though we generally agreed with her
assessments.
ach complaint and the matters not admitted by Dr Khamis are examined below,
along with other aspects of some of the particulars. Notwithstanding
admissions by Dr Khamis it is useful to consider the circumstances of each of
the complaints in turn.
lthough the parties had not requested that we proceed on a two-stage basis we
adjourned to consider whether the Complaint was proved.
In undertaking our task,
and notwithstanding Dr Khamis’s admissions, we were mindful of the
obligation to think carefully in
reaching our conclusion (
Briginshaw v
[1938] HCA 34
(1938) 60 CLR 336).
Complaint One A and One B
s set out in the annexure, Complaint One concerned Dr Khamis’s failure
to adequately examine or assess Patient A and his failure
to develop an adequate
medical plan for the patient’s Polymyalgia Rheumatica. Dr Khamis admitted
the particulars alleged except
the question of whether Patient A’s dose of
Prednisone needed to be reduced, and if so, at what rate. Dr Khamis said that he
relied on the discharge summary in that he would have been given a copy of the
discharge summary when the patient presented (Exhibit
A, statement of Dr
Khamis, paragraph 49, and pages 46 to 49. And 52 of Annexure C), and in effect,
could be taken to have deferred
to the specialist’s knowledge in not
considering any other course of action with respect to Prednisone. Whilst Dr
well have been cognisant of those aspects of the discharge summary
there is no evidence that he considered that information in the
development of
an adequate management plan.
omplaint One B was that Dr Khamis was guilty of unsatisfactory professional
conduct under s139B(1)(b) of the National Law in that
he had failed to meet the
requirements of clause 7 of Schedule 2 of the
Health Practitioner Regulation
(NSW) Regulation 2010
in relation to Patient A’s clinical records. The
alleged breaches took place on 13 January 2014, on 12 December 2014, and again
on 16 December 2014 in Dr Khamis not recording information that was known to him
that was relevant to Patient A’s diagnosis
or treatment plan, and more
generally by not including information that would enable another practitioner to
continue management
of Patient A.
n her report Dr Duncan expressed the view that Dr Khamis’s conduct in
relation to Patient A as particularised fell significantly
below the standard
expected of a general practitioner of an equivalent level of training and
experience at the time, and it invited
her strong criticism. The Committee is of
the same view even allowing that Dr Khamis may well have been relying on the
summary as an aspect of developing a management plan for Patient
n our view Dr Khamis’s conduct fell significantly below the standard
reasonably expected of a practitioner of his level of training
and experience,
and his record keeping was in contravention of the Regulation as alleged.
Complaint Two A and Two B
r Khamis admits the entirety of this complaint. On 6 March 2015 he was
assessing Patient B, who had been seen by others in the practice
in the past. He
diagnosed bilateral renal artery stenosis, referred the patient to a vascular
surgeon, and provided a prescription
for Olmesartan. However, Dr Khamis failed
to properly examine or assess the patient in that he did not measure the
weight or blood pressure, and did not investigate by urinalysis.
Dr Khamis did not order follow up pathology of creatinine, electrolyte
or urea, nor any blood pressure recordings in the first month of treatment.
While the prescription of Olmesartan is not necessarily
contra- indicated it
potentially has side effects and Dr Khamis should have followed up with regular
electrolyte investigation and
blood pressure recordings in the first month (Dr
Duncan’s report, p13). Dr Khamis’s records were inadequate in that
did not record his findings, or results of examinations, his reasoning or a
co-ordinated plan.
n our view Dr Khamis’s conduct fell significantly below the standard
reasonably expected of a practitioner of his level of training
and experience,
and his record keeping, such as it was in contravention of the Regulation as
Complaint Three A and Three B
etween 2012 and July 2013 Patient C attended the medical practice for regular
venesections for his Porphyia Cutanea Tarda, which were
performed by Dr Khamis
or one of the practice nurses. The patient returned for regular venesections in
December 2014 and was seen
by Dr Khamis on a few occasions through to March
he complaint is that in 2013 and 2014 Dr Khamis failed to adequately manage
Patient C’s condition in that he did not arrange
for gene analysis,
monitor or discuss
various factors relevant to the condition, exclude potential associated
comorbidities or prepare a coordinated health plan. It is
also said that between
2012 and 2015 Dr Khamis failed to manage or monitor the patient’s iron and
haemoglobin levels in that
he did not order iron and haemoglobin studies
regularly or order recent haemoglobin values before venesections. Additionally,
before nor after the venesections did he measure blood pressure and
pulse rate.
r Khamis largely admits the particulars of the complaint but says that he did
discuss alcohol intake, iron containing medications
and exposure to the chemical
dioxine with Patient C although he failed to make a note in his record. The
Commission submitted that
we should conclude that Dr Khamis was not to be
believed and pointed to inconsistencies in his statements and in other material
as the medical reports obtained in respect of the first two s150
proceedings. It may well be that Dr Khamis is of the view that he
discussed these matters with Patient C but there is no evidence that he did, and
we are unable to conclude that he did
hen it comes to the criticism that he failed to order iron and haemoglobin
studies on a regular basis Dr Khamis refers to the table
prepared by Dr Duncan
and set out on pages 17, 18 and 19 of her report. There does not appear to be
any particular or considered
regularity in those studies, at least with respect
to the venesections undertaken. However it does appear to be the case that even
though Dr Khamis was without those iron and haemoglobin studies at particular
times he nevertheless proceeded with the venesections
without any apparent
concern and without taking steps taken to ensure that those studies were
ith respect to the issue of arranging for gene analysis, it is true that
between 2013 Dr Khamis did not make those arrangements. However
he had done so
in December 2012 when he referred Patient D. In paragraph 96 of his first
statement Dr Khamis says, “
It does not appear [Patient C] ever attended
for these studies
”. So even though Dr Khamis ordered the studies he
did not follow up. Whilst excluding HIV and Hepatitis C may have been ideal,
the circumstances of this patient the failure to do so is not conduct that falls
below the expected standard.
r Duncan’s view was that, as particularised, Dr Khamis’s conduct
fell significantly below the expected standard. Even
if Dr Khamis’s
arrangements for the gene analysis were adequate, and that he spoke to Patient C
there were regular iron and haemoglobin studies we
are of the view that Dr Khamis’s conduct in relation to Patient C in not
following up on the on the iron and haemoglobin levels is, of itself, conduct
that was significantly below the standard reasonably
to be expected of a
practitioner of his equivalent level of training or experience.
r Khamis admits the particulars of his breach of the obligation to keep
records. In the clinical records on 18 February 2015 he did
not include adequate
details of physical examination, the reason why he issued prescriptions for
Panadeine Forte and Disprosone,
and the reasons for pathology being ordered. In
this regard he has breached his obligation by failing to record the information
to him, the clinical opinion he reached, and information sufficient to
allow another medical practitioner to continue management
of Patient C.
r Khamis gives no explanation or excuse for failing to meet his obligations
and this is of particular concern given Dr Khamis’s
experience of the
complaint in 2012 and his commitment at that time to maintain records in
accordance with Schedule 2 of the
Health Practitioner Regulation (NSW)
Regulation 2010
. Record keeping is an essential part of good medical
practice. It is not difficult to meet the requirements of the Regulation. Dr
Khamis had previously been warned about his record keeping, and he had
undertaken to meet the requirements of the Regulation (Exhibit
1, Tab 8). In
those circumstances we find proved the complaint of unsatisfactory professional
conduct under s139B(1)(a) of the National
Complaint Four A and Four B
omplaint Four deals with that the treatment afforded to Patient D, with a
history of ischaemic heart disease, and seen by Dr Khamis
on a number of
occasions from 19 November 2014 to 9 March 2015. The allegation is that when Dr
Khamis saw Patient D on 19 November
2014 he failed to adequately examine or
assess him, provide instructions for follow up after a prescription for
Seretide, request
or organise an ECG and confirm whether he had attended an
appointment with a cardiologist.
r Khamis says that he did assess Patient D’s heart rate and rhythm,
blood pressure and chest auscultation although he failed
to so record in his
clinical notes, (Exhibit A, Tab 1, paragraph 102). In the absence of any medical
record it is difficult to be
confident that Dr Khamis did in fact listen to
Patient D’s heart and lungs and take his blood pressure. Dr Khamis says he
but at the same time he admits that he did not assess oxygen saturation or
assess Patient D’s weight and body mass index. We
conclude the evidence is
of what he would normally have done rather than Dr Khamis having a clear
recollection of a particular examination
with this particular patient, more than
two years ago.
ven if we resolve that issue in Dr Khamis’s favour it remains that his
overall examination, assessment and treatment was particularly
inadequate given
this patient’s history, the prescription for Seretide (a medication for
asthma when the patient presented
with chest pain), the failure to organise an
ECG test and the failure to follow up with an appointment with a cardiologist.
display a significant weakness in Dr Khamis’s practice. We find
that the care afforded to Patient D by Dr Khamis on 19 November
significantly below the standard expected, and amounts to unsatisfactory
professional conduct.
omplaint Four B concerns Dr Khamis’s alleged unsatisfactory record
keeping on 19 November 2014, 23 December 2014, and 9 March
2015, as well as Dr
Khamis not including information that would enable other practitioners to
understand Patient D’s history
and the future management plans for the
continuity of his care. His failures amount to unsatisfactory professional
conduct as defined
in s139B(1)(b). Each of these incidents is of concern, but
taken together, and in context of the warning in 2012, suggest the Dr
a particular weakness in the keeping of records.
Consideration of exercise of powers under s146B
ollowing an adjournment and consideration of the available evidence we
informed the parties that the Complaint had been proved, and
that we would be
giving consideration to an exercise of power under s146B of the National
here was no dispute that the exercise of power was to be protective of the
public and the profession, rather than punitive (
Health Care Complaints
Commission v Litchfield
(1997) 41 NSWLR 630). We should take a broad
conception of protection of the public, and our decision may have a general
effect beyond Dr Khamis (
Health Care Complaints Commission v Do
[2014] NSWCA 307
Prakash v Health Care Complaints Commission
NSWCA 153).
s Petrie then tendered a bundle of documents (Exhibit 3) detailing an
allegation that Dr Khamis had practised contrary to the conditions
that had been
imposed at the first s150 hearing and which had been continued after the second
s150 hearing. Included in the bundle
was data from Medicare listing
prescriptions issued by Dr Khamis between 4 November 2015 and 29 May 2017. Ms
Petrie also tendered
an updated chronology (Exhibit 4), which included details
of the recent s150 proceedings.
s Petrie handed up written submissions in relation to the ability of the
Committee to receive what became Exhibits 3 and 4, and also
written submissions
in respect of our inquiry more generally. Although not required those
submissions were of assistance.
ogether the material was put forward on the basis it would assist the
Committee to consider whether in all the circumstances orders
were required
under s146B of the National Law in order to protect the public interest.
r Jackson did not contest the Medicare records. Exhibit 3 includes a file
note recording a conversation with Dr Khamis on 20 June
2017 where Dr Khamis
acknowledges writing prescriptions but saying that he did not realise a
condition that he was not to practise
without supervision meant he could not
prescribe, but is now aware. In a follow up email Dr Khamis said that most of
the scripts
were written for family members and close friends.
e have treated the material as making an allegation of breach of conditions,
an allegation that has not yet been tested. Although
the Medicare list appears
extensive, many of the prescriptions were of repeats or given at the same time.
The issue of the prescriptions
might not be as frequent as first appears.
t appears that the receipt of the Medicare data prompted the Medical Council
to suspend Dr Khamis’s registration, and a few
days later the suspension
was lifted to permit Dr Khamis to have his name removed from the register.
Whilst it is a matter for the
Medical Council of NSW we expect the subject
matter of the recent s150 proceedings would be revisited were Dr Khamis to seek
registration.
omewhat counter-intuitively, the submission of the Commission was that the
tendered material demonstrated that Dr Khamis was not a
person who would comply
with conditions and therefore it was not appropriate to impose any conditions,
nor was there any utility
in doing so.
oth Ms Petrie and Mr Jackson submitted that a reprimand was the appropriate
exercise of power.
Is a reprimand available under s146B?
s Petrie submitted that a reprimand was within the power of a Committee even
when a practitioner was no longer registered.
ection 146A of the National Law provides that if the Committee finds the
subject matter of a complaint proved it may exercise any
power conferred on it
by Subdivision (3) of Division 3. Relevantly s146B of the National Law sets out
what the Committee may do in
relation to
a relevant health
practitioner
ection 146 of the National Law defines a relevant health practitioner as
‘a health practitioner registered under this Law’.
lthough Dr Khamis was registered under the National Law when the Complaint
was made, as envisaged by s144, he was not so registered
at the time of our
iven that the power of the Committee in s146B(1) of the National Law is
limited to a relevant health practitioner, meaning one registered
National Law, it would appear that none of the listed items would be available
to the Committee.
owever s146B(2) provides:
If the relevant health practitioner is not registered, a direction may
still be given under this section but has effect only so as
to require the
conditions concerned to be imposed when the health practitioner is
registered.
hat subsection would appear to provide certain powers to the Committee that
may be exercised even if the practitioner is not registered
at the time of the
he subsection refers to ‘a direction’ being able to be given
under the section. Subsection 146B(3) contains the words
order or directs that any condition be imposed’
which suggests that an
order and a direction are different exercises of power. Subsection 146B(1)(a)
refers to a caution or
reprimand, while subsection (1)(c) to (f) refer to
orders that may be made. It is only subsection 146B(1)(b) that contains
reference to conditions and the ability to impose conditions on a
practitioner’s registration. It is clear by subsection
(2) that the powers
of the Committee to deal with a practitioner who is not registered are limited
to a direction that conditions
be imposed when the health practitioner is
registered.
here appears to be no ability to caution or reprimand the practitioner or to
make any orders of the kinds listed in subsection (c)
to (f). That
interpretation makes sense within the scheme of the legislation. If a
practitioner is no longer registered there is
no utility in making orders of
those kinds that might otherwise be available. Nor is there any particular value
in issuing a caution
or reprimand to a practitioner who is not then registered.
However, there is utility in making a direction that conditions be imposed
a practitioner to become registered. It would be at that stage that the public
interest would need protection.
s Petrie also submitted that it would be inappropriate to make a direction to
impose a condition, as the condition would not apply
until some time in the
future of which the Committee would have no present knowledge. Whether and what
conditions might be made are
a matter for particular circumstances but it is
plain from the existence of subsection 146B(2) of the National Law contemplates
there will be circumstances where the Committee might make such a direction
t should be kept in mind that conditions, even those imposed on a registered
practitioner, apply in the future having been made for
the future protection of
the public based on the information presently available. The same may apply in
the case of a practitioner
not registered at the time of an inquiry.
n our view we do not have power to reprimand Dr Khamis, even if it would be
appropriate to do so were Dr Khamis still registered.
We do not make any
decision in that regard. We do not believe s146B(2) can be read as direction
for a condition that a reprimand
issue on registration. The power is one of
imposing conditions – a reprimand is not a condition.
ow that Dr Khamis is no longer registered our power is limited to making a
direction under s146B(2) of the National Law, and that
is the means of
protecting the public. Not to make a direction would leave Dr Khamis’s
registration open and unconditional,
and dependent on AHPRA intervening in the
registration process or the Medical Council proceeding under s150 of the
National Law.
Those matters are for others and are not within the scope of our
inquiry. It is our task to deal with the Complaint before us, and
to act in the
public interest. If no direction were made then all that would remain would be
our statement of reasons, and Dr Khamis
then able to register without any
conditions at all.
Should we make a direction?
s Petrie submitted that there was no need to make a direction as to
conditions as the ordinary process of reregistration with AHPRA
would lead to
the raising of any issues that needed to be considered at that time, and the
most recent s150 proceedings would be
the trigger for action by the Medical
Council of NSW.
hilst the National Law does provide for such checks at the time of
registration, it seems to us that to take that approach would deprive
of any practical operation.
ction under s150 is only available in respect of a registered practitioner.
Now that Dr Khamis is unregistered it is not clear that
he could be the subject
of a complaint under s144 of the National Law, at least not until he were
registered.
ven though Dr Khamis says he has no intention of seeking reregistration it
remains that he may change his mind and could reapply at
any time. He could not
be prevented from doing so. Were Dr Khamis registered we would impose conditions
on his practice. The Committee
has the ability to impose conditions on his
practice were he to register, and those conditions would apply from the moment
of registration.
Direction as to conditions
bove, we have set out our assessment of the Complaint and Dr Khamis’s
conduct and found the Complaint proved. Although Dr Khamis
often reached the
right diagnosis he did not collect all the information that would have been
useful in treatment. He did not follow
up develop plans of management. He failed
to make adequate records.
he events of the Complaints took place within the ordinary or typical
experience of a general practitioner in rural practice, and
throughout a period
of a few years. Dr Khamis left the practice in April 2015, and continued
attending some nursing home patients
until October 2015, when he ceased to
practice (putting aside any conclusion that may be drawn from the documents in
Exhibit 3).
The information we have does not demonstrate that Dr Khamis has been
diligent or thorough in keeping up to date professionally or
in meeting or
maintaining his training requirements. The information available leads us to
conclude that Dr Khamis has not practised
in the recent period at the high
standard we expect he did in the past.
ven allowing for his formal admissions we do not have any useful information
or explanation from Dr Khamis about his particular circumstances
at the time of
the events, nor do we have any understanding of how he sees his own conduct, or
how he reflects on his work. Dr Khamis
may have been lackadaisical in the
provision of care, or perhaps he was not as enthusiastically interested in his
patients as is
to be hoped. He may have been unwittingly slowing down and no
longer putting in the effort that the public is entitled to expect.
Whilst there
was a suggestion of cognitive impairment, it is unknown if that may have been a
factor in his treatment of the four
patients. Dr Khamis provided some limited
information about his current health, and acknowledges his health has been a
him withdrawing from practice.
e conclude that Dr Khamis should not be in practice unsupervised, and he
should only practice with others. Despite having completed
an online course Dr
Khamis needs to demonstrate he has absorbed and understood what is required.
There are unanswered questions about
his state of health and whether it may have
any impact on his practice.
ere Dr Khamis to return to practice he will be required to meet then current
requirements and may face additional conditions
considered necessary
by the National Board.
n our view the public will be protected by a direction that the following
conditions apply when Dr Khamis is registered under the
National Law.
