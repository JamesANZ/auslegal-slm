INTRODUCTION
1. On 29 November 2017 I made an order by consent in the
applicant’s favour with respect to the issue which he had referred
Tribunal pursuant to s28(2) of the Motor Accidents (Liabilities &
Compensation) Act 1973 (“the Act”). In
addition the parties were
agreed that the respondent was to pay the applicant’s costs of and
incidental to the reference taxed
on a party/party basis but they disagreed
question was
therefore adjourned to 13 December 2017 for argument.
DETERMINATION
Regulation 14(1)
Motor Accidents Compensation
Tribunal Regulations 2009
deals with the question of costs. That regulation
determining a reference, the Tribunal may order a party to the reference to pay
costs to another party to the reference
and may fix the reasonable amount of
those costs.”
3. The parties were agreed that regulation vests in the
Tribunal an unfettered discretion which must be exercised judicially.
the proper exercise of that discretion dictates that costs follow the
event and are therefore awarded to the successful party. The
rationale for such
an order was explained by McHugh J in Latoudis v Casey
[1990] HCA 59
at 567 in the following terms:
“The rationale of the
order is that it is just and reasonable that the party who has caused the other
party to incur the costs
of litigation should reimburse that party for the
liability incurred. The order is not made to punish the unsuccessful party.
function is compensatory. Thus, in civil proceedings an order may, and
usually will, be made even though the unsuccessful party
has nearly succeeded or
has acted reasonably in commencing the
proceedings.”
4. The ordinary rule that costs follow the event may be
departed from where the conduct of the successful party, other than that which
gave rise to the claim, was unreasonable or improper or where that party did
something connected with the proceedings which was calculated
to occasion
unnecessary litigation or expense: Unilever Australia Limited v Gunn, Rose Jane
& PD Wholesalers
[1998] TASSC 143.
There was no suggestion by either party
in this case that the ordinary rule should be departed from, it was just the
scale of costs
which was in dispute.
5. Counsel for the applicant noted that
the usual practice when making an order for costs under r14 was for the Tribunal
that the unsuccessful party pay the successful party’s costs of
and incidental to the reference at the rate of 85% of the fees
of Schedule 1 of the
Supreme Court Rules 2000
(the usual practice). Counsel for
the applicant submitted that the Tribunal should not follow the usual practice.
He did so for
the following reasons:
• By analogy he compared this case to the situation in
SGIC v Lane
[1997] SASC 6122.
In that case the plaintiffs were suing to enforce
an entitlement to an indemnity under an insurance policy. The plaintiffs were
successful and the trial judge ordered that the defendants pay the
plaintiffs’ costs taxed on a solicitor and client basis.
That order was
appealed and it was noted by Debelle J. that the ordinary rule is that costs are
paid on a party and party basis
and that generally speaking some special or
unusual feature is required to warrant a departure from the usual practice. He
an order to pay costs on a solicitor and client basis will not be found to
have miscarried unless it appears the order involved a
manifest error or
injustice. He noted:
support for the order of the trial judge may be found in the fact that, had the
plaintiffs treated the defendant’s
denial of liability to indemnify as a
repudiation of the contract, they could have recovered as damages their costs on
a solicitor
and client basis.”
• In this case it was submitted the statutory scheme
provides for an indemnity and for the payment of scheduled benefits when
statutory preconditions to payment are met. It was submitted the applicant was
entitled to scheduled benefits but the respondent
failed to make a determination
and in fact never made a determination in the applicant’s favour but in
the end, by consent,
paid his claim. It was this failure of the respondent to
indemnify the applicant which counsel for the applicant submitted was akin
wrongful repudiation of an insurance contract. It was made clear that the
applicant did not want solicitor/client costs but
that he wanted them paid on
the Supreme Court scale without any reduction.
6. The following further submissions were made by counsel for
the applicant:
• The applicant has received well in excess of the
statutory limit that an injured person is entitled to by way of medical and
disability benefits payable under the Motor Accidents (Liabilities &
Compensation) Regulations 2010 so in essence the respondent
has treated him as a
person to whom s2(5) of the Act applies without making a determination under
• This was a very large claim of in excess of $1,000,000.00 for
gratuitous services payable by way of disability benefits in
attendant care and domestic services which is ongoing and which settled for
$400,000.00;
• The issues in the reference were complex and concerned
the meaning of the phrase “indefinite period” which appears
of the Act and on which there has been no relevant decision since the daily care
provisions were inserted into the Act.
I note s2(5) and the definition of daily
care have been in operation since 1 August 2002;
• Factually there were
some complexities insofar as the medical evidence was
• These proceedings were intimately linked with common law
proceedings but this reference had to be determined first because
the Supreme
Court in determining whether or not the applicant was covered by s27A of the Act
might have determined the applicant’s
entitlement to ongoing gratuitous
care at the time of the certificate, i.e. at the time of the judgment in the
common law proceedings,
rather than at the outset which may have resulted in the
applicant losing his entitlement to this benefit, up until the date of the
common law judgment, if the common law claim had been dealt with
• His claim for this benefit is ongoing; and
the above served to demonstrate that this case was by no means an ordinary one
and hence the usual practice should
be departed from.
7. Counsel for the respondent submitted the Tribunal should
follow the usual practice for the following reasons:
• There was a proper justiciable issue before the
Tribunal and there was no allegation the respondent had acted with male fides
vexatiously, it is just that the applicant considers the respondent’s
actions were wrong;
• We still do not have a determination as to the
complex issue raised by this reference;
• If one looks at the
reference, the case settled for far less than what was claimed (I note from the
file, as at 30 June 2016,
the claim was quantified at just under $100,060,000.00
and it settled for approximately 40% of that sum);
• This is not a
question of indemnity; there is a consent that the respondent will pay the
applicant’s costs on a party/party
basis. SGIC v Lane (supra) is wholly
distinguishable and irrelevant;
• The usual practice is consistent with
what a successful party can normally recover in the Workers Rehabilitation &
Compensation
Tribunal; r15(2) of the Workers Rehabilitation & Compensation
Regulations 2011. In regard to this matter it was submitted that
determined by this Tribunal were similar to matters determined in the Workers
Rehabilitation & Compensation Tribunal
in that both tribunals have to deal
with medical questions, questions of statutory interpretation, complex matters
which can often
be multifactorial and claims for statutory compensation which
are associated with separate common law proceedings;
• The applicant
has in this case been unsuccessful before the Tribunal in respect of two
previous interlocutory matters.
8. Examples where this Tribunal has recently followed the usual
practice are Bugg v Motor Accidents Insurance Board [2016] TASMACT
3, a decision
of the former Chairperson, Chairperson Carey, and Simmons v Motor Accidents
Insurance Board [2016] TASMACT 1 a decision
of former Tribunal Member, Mr
9. The court in SGIC v Lane (supra) dealt with a common law claim
whereby the plaintiffs sought an indemnity from an insurer. In
R v Cohen &
Ors; ex parte Motor Accidents Insurance Board
[1979] HCA 46
(1979) 141 CLR 577
the High Court dealt with the question whether or not the Motor Accidents
Insurance Board engaged in the business of insurance and
whether its employees
were therefore “employed in the business of insurance” within the
meaning of an eligibility clause
of the relevant industrial organisation. The
Court’s decision discusses the meaning of an indemnity in the context of
Act. Mason J, with whose reasons all the judges, apart from Barwick CJ,
agreed, summarises the provisions of the Act and at [12]
says Part III
“creates a scheme of indemnity by the Board in relation to common law
liabilities arising out of motor vehicle
accidents which have resulted in death
or bodily injury”. As to the payment of scheduled benefits with which
this Tribunal
is concerned Mason J. says at [28] that Part IV of the Act
“provides for a scheme to be administered by the Board whereby
compensation
in the form of scheduled benefits is to be paid to those injured in
motor vehicle accidents or the dependants of those killed in
such accidents.
The scheme thus established is not one of insurance, since it involves no
indemnity in respect of common law liabilities
and, indeed, operates
irrespective of the existence of those liabilities”. While counsel for
the applicant might argue that
a premium needs to be paid in return for the
payment or reimbursement of scheduled benefits incurred which of itself amounts
indemnity, that is if a premium is not paid a person might be excluded
under a number of provisions set out in s24 of the Act, a
premium is clearly not
required to be paid in all cases for an injured person to be eligible for
scheduled benefits. Two common
examples that immediately spring to mind are
pedestrians and cyclists. It is therefore clear that Part IV of the Act does
provide an indemnity in the wider sense of that term and accordingly,
in my view, the principles in SGIC v Lane (supra) are not relevant
question I must determine.
10. I accept from a consideration of the file that
the applicant’s claim was a very large one which was complex from a
interpretation point of view and which involved complexities in the
medical evidence. I agree though, with counsel for the respondent,
highlighted the fact there are many matters similar to this one which are heard
and determined by the Workers Rehabilitation
& Compensation Tribunal.
Ultimately no determination was required because the parties came to an
agreement. Accordingly, although
counsel for the applicant says the respondent
was incorrect in the way it dealt with the applicant’s claim, there simply
been no determination about that. For reasons of consistency I am not
persuaded that the usual practice should not be followed in
this case. If the
usual practice is not followed, then not only will there be inconsistency
between the level of costs which can
be recovered in the Workers Rehabilitation
& Compensation Tribunal and this Tribunal, there will also be inconsistency
with decisions
in this Tribunal. It seems to me the usual practice has been
influenced not only by r15(2) of the Workers Rehabilitation & Compensation
Regulations 2011 but also by a decision of Zeeman J. in Trident Seafoods Pty Ltd
v Dransfield
[1993] TASSC 87.
That case was an appeal from the Workers
Compensation Commissioner who dismissed an application made by the appellant for
that the respondent pay the appellant’s costs of an unsuccessful
application made by the respondent. In those days s59 of
the Workers
Rehabilitation & Compensation Act 1988 prohibited the granting of costs to
or against any party unless there were
some special features arising from the
circumstances of the case before the Commissioner that warranted the making of
the order for
costs in favour of one of the parties. After reviewing the
matter, Zeeman J. concluded the Commissioner could have reached the position
that an order for costs should have been made. As to the level of costs,
counsel for the appellant submitted that costs should be
ordered on Table A
which was the highest award of costs available in the Supreme Court at that
time. Zeeman J. said, with respect
to that submission at [14]:
am not persuaded that that is appropriate. The proceedings were proceedings in
an inferior court. Table A is the highest
scale of costs applying to this
11. His Honour therefore made an order that the costs in
relation to the proceedings before the Workers Compensation Commissioner
awarded at the highest scale provided for in Table B which at the time was a
lower scale of costs applying to actions and applications
instituted in the
Supreme Court.
12. For the foregoing reasons there will be an order that
the respondent pay the applicant’s costs of and incidental to this
reference at the rate of 85% of the fees set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the
Supreme Court Rules 2000
