Clarification
Regarding Form 15A Response to Claim (lodged 22 August 2024)
August 2024, I lodged a Form 15A Response to Claim that contained incorrect
information about the payments made to the Claimant;
inaccuracies in that document were due to a mistake caused by my mother, Marivic
Angeles, who was managing the payments and providing
information;
mother was under significant stress at the time because of the court
proceedings, which led to her inadvertently misrepresenting
the amounts and
dates of the payments; and
correct payment details are now provided in
of this statement and are
supported by the attached bank records.
10 January 2025, the remaining balance owed to the Claimant is $300; and
confirm my intention to repay this balance at the earliest opportunity, or as
directed by the Court.
15 January 2025, Ms Cronin filed a further statement of evidence in
support of her claim in the following
Explanation of Payment:
confirm that the $3,000 of debt by the defendant Marjorie dated 14 May 2024 is
still outstanding. Marjorie borrowed $3,000 and
agreed to repay it within 2
weeks. This payment has not occurred and no explanation has been

agreement for the extra $500 it was understood
that she and her boyfriend 'Moo'
would share some profit with me as done in the past. They deal in buying and
selling used cars
privately and need to borrow.
Please refer to
Exhibit: 10.

buyers could purchase it. On 17 June 2024 Marivic

deposited $700 and verbally stated that the car was still being repaired.
matter proceeded to hearing and trial on 25 February 2025.
learned magistrate accepted into evidence the First Cronin Statement and the
Second Cronin Statement, but did not receive into
evidence Exhibit 14 from the
First Cronin Statement on the basis that it had nothing to do with the
addition, the following documents attached to the First Cronin Statement were
struck out on the basis of relevance (being character
references): the document
from the Catholic Parish of Applecross; the statutory declaration of
Dante Maribbay; the statutory declaration
of James Cronin attached to the
First Cronin
learned magistrate accepted into evidence the Angeles Statement except for pars
5 and 6 of the statement and all of the character
references attached to that
statement (on the grounds of relevance).
and Ms Angeles were given the opportunity to ask questions in
cross-examination of each other. Ms Angeles' mother, Marivik
Angeles, was
called as a witness by Ms Angeles and gave evidence-in-chief and was also
cross-examined by Ms Cronin.
is convenient to summarise the evidence of Marivik Angeles, which was as
Marivik Angeles made give payments totalling $7,500 to Ms Cronin on behalf
of her daughter, Ms Angeles.
she made these payments instead of her daughter because her daughter is a
student, and she asked Marivic Angeles to pay on her
behalf because she did not
have the money.
Marivic Angeles paid Ms Cronin $500 every week and has a receipt for
electronic (payment) from her bank to Ms Cronin's account.
in making the payments to Ms Cronin, Marivic Angeles sometimes forgot to
include her daughter's name. But for the payment made
Marivic Angeles recorded this against the name 'Payment Jorie'. Jorie
being Marjorie Angeles, the defendant.
for the payment of $700, Marivic Angeles put $200 extra because it was a late
payment and that this is part payment of the debt
another payment of $500 was made on 4 July and a final payment on
she made the payments as payment for Ms Angeles' debt to Ms Cronin in
respect of the loan.
way of closing submission, Ms Cronin put to the learned magistrate
that the payments of $500 and $700 received, totalling $1,200,
in respect of the
$3,000 loan the subject of the claim was 'the profit' (or interchangeably
referred to as 'the interest').
summarising her position by way of closing submission, Ms Angeles put to
the learned magistrate as
ANGELES, MS:
Yes. Your Honour, I will state based on my statement and
the truth. I can confirm to now that I already made the payment to the
of $2700, which are in annexure A, and the bank transfer recording supporting
these payments. So 1 May 2024, 17 June 2024,
4 July 2024, 29 July
2024 and lastly 9 August 2024. And as of today, I am confidently that
the remaining balance owed to the claimant
is $300. Thank you.
reaching her Decision, the learned magistrate determined
14 May 2024, Ms Angeles approached Ms Cronin for a loan of $3,000
which she promised to repay in two weeks (ie around 27 May 2024).
Ms Angeles asked to borrow the $3,000 to purchase a motor vehicle for her
own use and not to buy and sell at a profit.
it is not in dispute that there was no charge payable, and that no interest was
or would be payable on the $3,000 loan amount.
Mrs Angeles had paid Ms Cronin $2,700 of the $3,000 loan on behalf of
Ms Angeles.
admitted that she owed $300 of the $3,000 loan and that having considered the
evidence, the calculations by Ms Angeles
are found to be correct.
Ms Cronin, who is not the holder of a financial services licence or an
Australian creditors licence, is, from the evidence, including
Ms Cronin's
own evidence, a regular moneylender to a number of people, not just
Ms Angeles' family.
the relevant 'voluntary payments' received by Ms Cronin were in fact
intended to be by Ms Angeles, and on her behalf and expressly
described as
'Jorie' in the payment transactions, by Marivic Angeles, repayments of the
principal loan amount of $3,000. These are
the payments that were made on
9 August 2024 in the sum of $400, 17 June 2024 in the sum of $700,
the amount paid on 31 May 2024
in the sum of $500,
and 15 August 2024 in the sum of $500, totalling $2,200.
the payment made on 29 July was one that was made expressly but orally on
behalf of Ms Angeles by her mother Marivic Angeles
and that Marivic
Angeles' evidence at trial is accepted in this regard.
an additional payment of $800 by Marivic Angeles to Ms Cronin made on
13 August 2024, $500 of which related to Ms Angeles' loan.
the payments of $500 and $700 were not 'voluntary payments' or 'gifts' from, or
on behalf of Ms Angeles to Ms Cronin, but instead
were part payments
of the principal made in respect of the debt and reduction of the debt.
The appeal to this court

Magistrates Court (Civil Proceedings) Act
(WA) (MCCP Act) an appeal from a judgment of the Magistrates
Court in a minor case is subject to s 32 of the MCCP Act.
32(3)(b) of the MCCP Act provides, relevantly, that an appeal against a judgment

grounds that there has been a denial of

new evidence was sought to be adduced in the appeal. I have therefore
determined the appeal on the evidence that was before the
magistrate.
Grounds of appeal
notice of appeal filed 17 April 2025, Ms Cronin appealed against the
Decision. The sole ground of appeal is denial of natural
justice, which
Ms Cronin augmented in her notice of appeal and outline of submissions
dated 16 June 2025. These can be summarised
as follows:

Litigant in person appeal
the hearing of the appeal on 9 September 2025, Ms Cronin appeared as a
litigant in person without the assistance of an interpreter.
I was mindful that
the trial of the lower court proceedings, both parties had the assistance of an
interpreter. However, when asked,
Ms Cronin confirmed that she was ready
to proceed with the hearing of her appeal in person, and without the need for an
interpreter
and engaged with the hearing. Ms Cronin confirmed that she
intended to rely on her written submissions and the evidence and materials
before the lower court.
order of this court made 19 August 2025, the learned registrar made orders
that service of the notice of appeal on the respondent

2025 and the service by Malcolm Raymond Barret at Kabayan Buffet 243 Walter
Road, West Morley, WA, 6062 on 20
June 2025 be good and sufficient service
of the notice of appeal. Ms Angeles was not present at the hearing of the
appeal and has
not filed a notice of intention to respond.
Ms Cronin is a litigant in person in the appeal, she is entitled to some
leniency in relation to compliance with the court
I approach the documents in which she articulates her appeal with some
flexibility.
I need to be astute to ensure that, in a poorly expressed or unstructured
document in which she sets out her case, there is no viable
case which, with
appropriate amendment or permissible assistance from the court, could be put
into proper form.
the same time, I also need to ensure that any latitude given to Ms Cronin
as a litigant in person does not deprive Ms Angeles
of her rights to
procedural fairness and a fair hearing, notwithstanding that she chose not to
appear at the hearing of the

proceedings be given a fair hearing. This normally

requirements of natural justice in this case are therefore to be viewed in the
context of the minor case procedure of the Magistrates

six months later on 25 February 2025. Prior
to trial, there were a number
of procedural hearings on 30 September 2024, 25 November 2024,

Stop again. Listen. Listen carefully. You have given me a
26 page witness statement. That should contain all of your relevant
Does it contain all of your relevant evidence, including all supporting
documents? Yes or no.
HIS HONOUR:
No, no. It wasn't a - it was a yes or no question.
Have you given all of your relevant documents to the court in your
witness statement that you previously lodged? Yes or no.
CRONIN, MS:
Yes, I did. However, the claimant made another
statement, stating this and this and this and this, the payment. So I need to
you evidence of what are those payments for, which is not there.
HIS HONOUR:
Okay. At the beginning of the hearing do you remember me
asking you do you want to lodge another statement. I asked that question
twice and you never answered me. I will ask it a third time. Do you want to
lodge another statement?
CRONIN, MS:
Yes, your Honour.
learned magistrate, at the listing conference on 13 January 2025, provided
Ms Cronin with ample opportunity to require additional
time to produce to
the court this further
HIS HONOUR:
Equally, ma'am, I don't want to rush you with your
statement. I want to make sure that you do your statement correctly, and in
full form with all the materials, and also that your opponent gets a chance to
think about it. So I will give you the - if you need
a little bit more time -
can you do 24 January still or do you want me to push that out a bit more?
HIS HONOUR:
... Do you understand why I am making that order,
Ms Cronin? I'm going to make the trial date 25 February. I am going to
you 24 January as the deadline for you to do your statement. That way she
has a month to consider what you have said, and prepare.
All right. Do you
understand, Ms Cronin, or was there something further you wanted to say?
CRONIN, MS:
But I would prefer 29 January.
HIS HONOUR:
I know you would. But I don't, and it's up to me, not you.
Okay. And the reason I don't prefer that previous time is because,
what I said before, you need to do your statement, and I want to give you a
reasonable period of time to do that. 24 January
is a reasonable period of
time. That's a couple of weeks, roughly, from today - slightly less than
that. And then she will have
a month to think about that, and you will have a
trial on 25 February ...
HIS HONOUR:
Do you want me to make it 27 January for your statement, if
you need a little bit more time?
CRONIN, MS:
No. What I am trying to say, I don't need it to submit it
anymore. I don't need. Because everything is ..
HIS HONOUR:
Yes, you do, because you have told me you're going to say
some extra things at the trial. And if you're going to do that -

the amount in
CRONIN, MS:
... The defendant's loan of 3000 is still unpaid today.
CRONIN, MS:
Whatever additional payments I received, they were voluntary
offered to me.
HER HONOUR:
What are the additional payments that you did receive?
CRONIN, MS:
It's, like, they will say - the mother will say, tubo, which
is a profit.
INTERPRETER (CLAIMANT):
CRONIN, MS:
these additional payments amounting to $1,200, the submission put to the learned
magistrate by Ms Cronin, was that this was 'voluntarily
offered' to her by
way of a profit
CRONIN, MS:
The extra payments were - it's like - it's like a profit
sharing. It's voluntary, offered to me the 500 and then the 700 ...
HER HONOUR:
So you made $1,200 on a $3,000 loan.
CRONIN, MS:
Yes, your Honour.
learned magistrate sought clarification as to the basis on which Ms Cronin
sought payment of the entirety of the Loan amount
in circumstances where the
evidence put to the lower court by Ms Cronin was that she had received
payment of $1,200 from the defendant
HER HONOUR:
All right. So you've received $1200. Why are you claiming
CRONIN, MS:
Because the 500 and the 700 is a profit sharing and
voluntary offered by the cost - by the defendant's mother.
HER HONOUR:
But it wasn't offered by the defendant.

Sorry. I'm just dealing with your evidence. I don't need -
whether I need it or not, you haven't given it to me, and I'm not going
anyone to adduce any additional evidence today because Magistrate Crawford made
it very clear that this was going to be
the evidence of the hearing. Because
you don't speak English and you need an interpreter, I need you to elaborate on
your evidence.
So I'm just raising with you the documents that you are raising
with me, and I'm asking you to explain how something that doesn't

Ms Angeles' mother before 31 May is relevant.
You were paid $500 on 31 May, you say the voluntary payment. You had a
discussion with Ms Marivik. You said you had a discussion
with the defendant in
her shop - in her mother's shop, and her mother. I'm asking you to elaborate on
that. You've taken me to

imposed - I have all the texts, which is relevant, and I can show on
my next - I
have a court hearing on 26 March and I will show - - -
HER HONOUR:
I'm not interested in any other hearing.
CRONIN, MS:
As I said - - -
HER HONOUR:
I'm not interested in who owes - I'm only interested in this
review of the lower court transcript shows that Ms Cronin was reminded by
the learned magistrate of her opportunity to provide
clarification and present
evidence about her
HER HONOUR:
Thank you. Now, Ms Cronin, all the questions are
finished. Correct? This is an opportunity, if there's anything you want to
if you were cut off giving the answer, not cut off giving some evidence
that you weren't asked about. Is there anything that you
were asked about that
you were unable to answer fully?
I think I answer everything. Okay. All right. Thank you. You can leave the
witness box and take your material with you. Thank
you very much.
on a review of the lower court file, Ms Cronin appears to be seeking to
enforce terms of a purported agreement for 'interest'
or 'profit' in respect of
the Loan that are so vague in nature and not properly documented, such that they
are not capable of being
understood by reference to the evidence and materials
available. Ms Cronin's own evidence at trial was that 'whatever additional
payments' she received 'were voluntarily offered' to
CRONIN, MS:
Okay: I do not have a business of lending money.
I only lend money to the defendant, her parents, brother, and Lucy
Avellaneda.
I lend them money in good faith and help them in their business and
family needs. Whatever additional payments I receive, they
were voluntarily
offered to me.
HER HONOUR:
Okay. Continue.
CRONIN, MS:
I also lend money for friends, acquaintances, who are
desperately in need without asking or expecting anything in return.
is, even if Ms Cronin had satisfied me that she was denied natural justice
in the manner alleged in respect of the evidence
sought to rely on (which is not
the case here), it is not clear to me that the evidence would have established
that the payments
of $500 and $700 received, totalling $1,200, by Ms Cronin
were in addition to the Loan amount. There is also the question of how
arrangement can be said to bind the defendant in any event.
issue in relation to this ground of appeal, from a natural justice perspective,
is whether Ms Cronin had been given reasonable
or sufficient
opportunity
prepare her case by the filing of evidence so as to be given a fair or
reasonable opportunity to present her
my review of the transcript, it is not evident to me that the learned magistrate
prevented Ms Cronin from saying everything she
wanted to say (aside from
matters determined by the learned magistrate to be irrelevant and therefore not
admissible). Ms Cronin
had, in my view, ample opportunity to produce to
the court the evidence and materials she sought to rely on, or to seek the time
of the court to allow her the time. Ms Cronin did not act on this
opportunity.
fact that Ms Cronin does not like this result does not mean that she has
been denied natural justice. As this court has previously
Ogbonna v CTI Logistics
[T]he question of whether there has been a failure to comply with the rules of
natural justice is not answered by reference to the
outcome of the exercise of
the relevant power. The principles of natural justice are not
concerned with the merits of a particular
exercise of power, but with the
procedure that must be observed in its exercise. The focus of
attention must therefore be on the
position as it stood before the impugned
decision is taken.
has not satisfied me that she was denied natural justice by the learned
magistrate. In my view, Ms Cronin had sufficient
opportunity to present
her case and has not established any denial of natural justice in the manner in
which the learned magistrate
allowed her to present her case or to give
evidence-in-chief.
ground of appeal has not been established.
Was there a denial of natural justice because the learned magistrate did not
give Ms Cronin sufficient opportunity to cross examine
Ms Angeles?
Ms Cronin's
position as regards cross-examination, is set out in the notice of appeal and
the outline of submissions, and can be
summarised as follows: That the learned
magistrate did not allow the appellant to properly cross-examine the respondent
her debts and failure to repay the borrowed sum.
Disposition
right to challenge by cross-examination a witness whose evidence is adverse, in
important respects, to the case a party wishes
to present is an aspect of the
obligation to accord natural justice. However, a magistrate has a wide
discretionary power in any
proceedings to contain cross-examination within
proper limits and to disallow repetitious, prolix or unnecessary
is evident from the transcript of the hearing before the learned magistrate
that Ms Cronin was given the opportunity to, and did,
cross-examine
Ms Angeles and indeed Marivik Angeles. It is sufficient to cite the
CRONIN, MS:
Yes, your Honour. Okay. Actually, I have nothing against
Jorie, because she's my favourite. Okay. But I want to ask all of this.
Jorie, why did you borrow money from me, the 3000, may I ask?---Yes, and I've
already given you so many explanation even (indistinct).
Yes, why you still
asking for it?
CRONIN, MS:
I just want to know - also I want to know, what did you do -
HER HONOUR:
Let her answer the first question.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've given you a clarification, even on the text
message, that I need to borrow $3000. I didn't even want to borrow from you,
but out of need, I just, and also we're like a family, so that's why I asked
you. I borrowed money from you, it's because for the
car, personal use and -
and nothing related buying and selling.
CRONIN, MS:
Okay. Okay. So you promised to pay it in two weeks' time,
but it's now nine months, and you haven't even paid me or returned -
my messages. Is there any reason why?
HER HONOUR:
So there are two questions there. This witness's evidence
is that she has paid you $2700.
CRONIN, MS:
Yes, but I explained already where the money went to.
HER HONOUR:
That's what you did with the money. This witness says that
she caused her mother to send the money, either orally or in writing,
behalf to pay.
CRONIN, MS:
Okay. I think that's all that I have to ask because I
already explained.
HER HONOUR:
Yes, but do you want to put to this witness if you had a
conversation with the mother about not accepting what it was - what the
of the money is for?
HER HONOUR:
All right. This is your opportunity. Is there any other
questions that you want to ask your witness?
CRONIN, MS:
No, your Honour.
HER HONOUR:
Okay. Ms Cronin, this is your opportunity to
cross-examine the witness.
Angeles, the respondent's mother, was also cross-examined by Ms Cronin in
respect of the Loan and the $500 and $700 payments
CRONIN, MS:
Okay. Wasn't the - you told me verbally - wasn't it the 500
and the 700 that you paid me, you verbally told me that was the interest
3000 loan? And then after that, you said, 'I won't give you - is it okay not to
give you anything any-more?'; is that correct?
INTERPRETER (WITNESS):
No, your Honour, all payment for Jorie's debt.
my view, the learned magistrate gave Ms Cronin considerable latitude in
asking questions in cross-examination. She had ample
opportunity to challenge
the evidence of Ms Angeles (and Marivik Angeles) and did so.
has not satisfied me that she was denied natural justice on the basis that she
was not given a sufficient opportunity to
cross-examine Ms Angeles.
ground of appeal has not been established.
Was the learned magistrate biased?
Ms Cronin's
contentions as to bias and apprehended bias, as set out in the notice of appeal
and the outline of submissions, concern
the perceived behaviour of the learned
magistrate (ie behaving harshly and unsympathetically towards Ms Cronin,
while exhibiting
leniency, emotional support and undue sympathy to
Ms Angeles and her mother; change in tone; assisted Ms Angeles by
putting 'some
leading questions' to be asked by Ms Angeles).
'central element in the system of justice administered by our courts is that it
should be fair and this means that it must be open,
impartial and
even-handed'.
test for actual bias was summarised by Newnes JA in
Chin v Legal Practice
Board of Western
Where a party contends that actual bias exists, the applicant must show that the
mind of the decision-maker is so committed to a
conclusion already formed as to
be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or arguments may be presented:
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng
[2001] HCA 17
; (2001) 205 CLR 507, 532 [72]. Actual bias will exist where the
decision-maker has prejudged the case against the applicant, or
acted with such
partisanship or hostility as to show that the decision-maker had a mind made up
against the applicant and was not
open to persuasion in favour of the applicant:
[36], [72]. Such an allegation must be 'distinctly
made and clearly proved':
[69], [127].
have reviewed the transcript of the hearing on 25 February 2025, as well as
Ms Cronin's observations on the transcript set out
in her notice of appeal
and outline of submissions. From my review of the case as a whole,
Ms Cronin has not satisfied me that the
learned magistrate was
actually biased in the manner described in
. The allegation
of bias certainly has not been 'clearly proven'. Rather, what occurred was
that the learned magistrate, correctly,
sought to confine the evidence to the
issues in dispute. She then sought to engage with Ms Angeles to seek to
understand the issues
from her perspective.
establish that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias, the appellant
would need to point to what it was that led the magistrate
to decide the case
other than on its factual or legal merits. He would then need to identify the
connection between the evidence
of apprehended bias and how that caused the
tribunal to deviate from deciding the case on the
judging whether there is a reasonable apprehension of bias, it should be
assumed that the lay observer would base his or her opinion
on a fair assessment
of the judicial officer's conduct in the context of the trial as a
McLure P observed in
De Alwis [No 2]
, in the context of dealing
with an assertion of bias, it 'will often be necessary with a self-represented
litigant for a trial judge
to intervene in order to stop irrelevant matters
being raised and to prevent unnecessary delays or
disruptions'.
That is in part what occurred in the present hearing. The fact that the
learned magistrate made rulings against Ms Cronin does
not provide a basis
for a reasonable apprehension that the learned magistrate did not bring an
impartial or unprejudiced mind to
bear on those matters and other
my review of the case as a whole, I do not consider that a 'fair-minded lay
observer might reasonably apprehend' that the learned
magistrate had not
brought an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues the
magistrate had to decide. Rather,
as I said in relation to actual bias, it
would have been apparent to a fair-minded lay observer that the learned
magistrate was trying
to confine the evidence to the issues in dispute, and then
to engage with Ms Cronin to seek to understand the issues from her
perspective.
There is no arguable basis in the manner in which the
learned magistrate conducted the trial for an allegation of apprehended
has not satisfied me that there has been a denial of natural justice on the
basis that the magistrate acted with actual
or apparent bias.
ground of appeal has not been established.
the reasons which I have set out above, the appeal should be dismissed.
would ordinarily follow the
as Ms Angeles elected to take no part in the appeal, the appropriate
order is that there be no order as to costs.
