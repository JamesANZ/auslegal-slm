Sentencing Snapshot 290: Sentencing Trends for Intentionally Causing
Injury in the Higher Courts of Victoria 2018-19 to 2022-23
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
intentionally causing injury in the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria (the
higher courts) from 2018-19 to
Adjustments made by
the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June 2023 have been
incorporated into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on intentionally causing injury and other offences is also
available on
A person who intentionally causes injury to another person without lawful
excuse is guilty of this offence. Intentionally causing
injury is an indictable
offence that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and/or a fine
of 1,200 penalty units.

If the offence was committed on or after 28 October 2018 and the victim was
on duty as an emergency worker, custodial officer or youth
justice worker, it is
a category 1 offence, meaning courts must almost always impose a custodial
This Snapshot focuses on cases where intentionally causing injury was the
principal offence, that is, cases where intentionally causing
injury was the
offence that received the most severe
Intentionally causing injury was the principal offence in 4.2% of cases
sentenced in the higher courts between 2018-19 and 2022-23.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 367 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of intentionally causing injury.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
intentionally causing injury by financial year. There were
84 people sentenced
for this offence in 2022-23, down from 88 in the previous year. The number of
people sentenced was highest in
2021-22 (88 people) and lowest in 2020-21 (55
There were also 3 people who received a custodial supervision order, 7 people
who received a non-custodial supervision order, and
2 people who were released
unconditionally for the principal offence of intentionally causing injury during
the five-year period.

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the principal offence of intentionally causing injury from
2018-19 to 2022-23.
The principal sentence describes the sentences for the offence at
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves
multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the same as or
longer than the principal
Principal sentences of imprisonment
There were 291 principal sentences of imprisonment
for intentionally causing injury. Table 2 shows that 212 (72.9%) were
non-aggregate
imprisonment terms, and 79 were aggregate imprisonment
There were 127
people who received a community correction order in addition to their
imprisonment term.

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.

offence of intentionally causing injury, 205 were eligible
to have a non-parole
