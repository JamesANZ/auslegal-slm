The committee dealt with this bill in
Alert Digest No. 8 of 2016
Minister responded to the committee’s comments in a letter received on
21 November 2016. A copy of the letter is attached
to this report.
Alert Digest No. 8 of 2016 - extract
Delegation of legislative power—setting level
of charge by regulation
This bill provides for the imposition of a charge on ‘approved course
providers’ as a tax. Approved course providers are
VET providers approved
in accordance with the
VET Student Loans Bill 2016
. The charges imposed on
‘approved course providers’ are intended to fund the VET student
loan program, including costs
incurred by the Commonwealth in administering the
program, data collection and analysis as well as compliance and enforcement
(explanatory memorandum, p. 1).
Clause 7 of the bill, however, provides for the amount of charge payable to
be prescribed by the regulations or in a manner worked
out in accordance with a
method prescribed in the regulations.
The explanatory memorandum (at p. 5) states that ‘it is anticipated
that the amount of the charge will be determined having
regard to the size of
the provider’ and that ‘prior to the introduction of the regulations
a fees schedule will be determined
that is consistent with the Australian
Government Cost Recovery Guidelines and documented in a cost recovery
implementation statement’.
The committee notes this explanation of how it is anticipated that the level
of charge will be determined. However, there are no limitations
on the amount of
charge payable on the face of the bill. As the setting of the amount of charges
is a significant matter, the committee
seeks the Minister’s advice as to
whether the bill can be amended to provide greater legislative guidance as to
how the charge
amount is to be determined and to limit the amount that may be
Minister's response - extract
The detail about the calculation methodology, amounts and limits to charges
are still being worked through by the Department in consultation
Department of Finance.
The reputation of the vocational education and training sector has been
impacted by unscrupulous providers, driven by financial gain
with poor student
outcomes. Urgent reform is required to address these problems. In developing the
Bill, it was felt that the demand
for urgent reform outweighed the benefit of
delaying introduction to enable more detail to be included in the Charges Bill.
decision was made having regard to the other controls in place to ensure
the appropriateness of the charge and the calculation methodology:
a. the detail will be contained in regulations which will be subject to
Parliamentary scrutiny through being subject to disallowance
for 15 sitting days
after tabling in both Houses of Parliament; and
b. the Department will need to comply with and meet the requirements of the
Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines when formulating
the charges
calculation methodology and determining the appropriate charge amounts. A cost
recovery implementation statement will
also need to be prepared to further
facilitate transparency and accountability.
There is also benefit in providing the detail in regulations as it will allow
for greater flexibility to deal with the evolution of
the program and to ensure
that charge methodology and amounts remain appropriate.
Committee response
The committee thanks the Minister for this response.
The committee notes the Minister’s advice that the ‘detail about
the calculation methodology, amounts and limits to charges
are still being
worked through by the Department’ and that ‘it was felt that the
demand for urgent reform outweighed
the benefit of delaying introduction to
enable more detail to be included in the Charges Bill’. The committee
acknowledges
these points; however, from a scrutiny perspective, the committee
does not generally consider that the need for urgency is, of itself,
sufficient justification for leaving important aspects of a legislative scheme
to the regulations. While the Australian Government
Cost Recovery Guidelines may
currently be applicable as a matter of policy, the committee notes that it
remains the case that there
is no guidance on the face of the bill as to how the
charge amount is to be determined, nor is there any limit on the amount that
be imposed.
The committee requests that the key information be included in the
explanatory memorandum, noting the importance of these documents
as a point of
access to understanding the law and, if needed, as extrinsic material to assist
with interpretation (see
section 15AB
Acts Interpretation Act
The committee draws its general concerns in relation to setting the amount
of a charge by regulation to the attention of Senators.
Noting that the
regulations will be subject to Parliamentary disallowance the committee leaves
the appropriateness of setting the
level of charge by regulation in this
instance to the consideration of the Senate as a whole.
The committee also draws this matter to the attention of the Senate
Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for information.
