Disability support pension: medical evidence for rating under requisite
SECRETARY TO THE DSS and BUNWORTH
Decided: 3rd June 2014 by S.M McCabe
Bunworth claimed the disability support pension (DSP). Bunworth suffered from
lumbar spondylosis, Hepatitis C and a hearing impairment.
He argued that his
back condition attracted twenty points under the relevant impairment table and
the Social Security Appeals Tribunal
(SSAT) agreed with that assessment and
decided that he was entitled to receive the DSP. The SSAT had been provided with
from a job capacity assessor which suggested that Bunworth’s
impairment would only attract 10 points under the table but rejected
favour of its own assessment at the hearing.
The DSS sought review at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) with fresh
evidence in the form of a specialist report from an
occupational physician.
The issue was whether Bunworth suffered from a back condition which attracted
20 points under Table Four of the Tables for the Assessment
of Work- Related
Impairment for Disability Sup-port Penion, and whether he was therefore entitled
to the DSP.
Bunworth’s application for DSP was lodged on 5 March 2013 and the AAT
therefore had regard to Bunworth’s con-dition at
that point and in the
thirteen-week period that followed (sch.2, cl.4 of the
Social Security
(Administration) Act 1999
). The AAT found that there was no doubt that
Bunworth suffered from a degenerative condition of the lumbar spine and
Hepatitis C
at the relevant time.
The Secretary argued that there was no evidence that the Hepatitis C
im-paired Bunworth in any way and the AAT accepted that position.
The hearing
impairment was not discussed in material before the AAT.
Bunworth met the first requirement for DSP under
Security Act 1991
(the Act) which was that the applicant have a physical,
in-tellectual or psychiatric impairment.
The second requirement under
(1) (b) of the Act is that the impairments
attract at least 20 points under the relevant impairment tables.
The third requirement in
(1) (c) is that the applicant has a
‘continuing inability to work’. That requirement includes
undertaking a program of
sup-port unless the person has a severe impairment
which means it rates at least twenty points on one impairment table. Bunworth
had not engaged in a pro-gram of support for the requisite length of time which
would only be at issue if his impairment was found
to attract less than twenty
points under Table Four.
Medical evidence
The case turned on the medical evidence. Dr Adam provided the fresh medical
re-port relied upon by the Secretary before the AAT. He
was questioned in detail
assessment that Bunworth’s
impairment attracted ten points under Table
Dr Adam gave evidence that it was unlikely that Bunworth could
‘undertake any work’. Nevertheless, Bunworth did not have
impairment with a ‘severe’ functional impact that would result in an
award of twenty points under Table Four. Under
that Table a person has a
‘severe’ functional impact where:
(1) The person is unable to
(a) perform any overhead activities; or
(b) turn their head, or bend their neck, without moving their trunk; or
(c) bend forward to pick up a light object form a desk or table; or
(d) remain seated at least 10 minutes.
The evidence from Dr Adam was that the real issue was whether Bunworth could
remain seated for 10 minutes.
Bunworth did not remain seated for 10 minutes during the course of the AAT
hearing. The SSAT’s observation of the same thing
appears to have been why
it rejected the job capacity assessor’s opinion that a 10 point impairment
rating applied.
Bunworth’s wife gave evidence at the AAT that he did not take
painkillers on the day of the AAT hearing, in order to stay alert.
Without the
painkillers, it was harder for him to sit for longer periods.
Despite his observation of Bunworth at the AAT hearing, Dr Adam did not
resile from the view that, at the time of consultation in
January 2014, Bunworth
could sit for at least 10 minutes. In particular, Dr Adam relied on the fact
that Bunworth had travelled from
the Gold Coast to Brisbane for the consultation
with only one break.
Dr Adam acknowledged that someone would not meet the criteria of being able
to sit for ten minutes if the person would endure serious
The AAT considered the issue of whether a person could sit for at least ten
minutes because they had taken painkillers. The AAT found
that on a proper
construction of the guidelines, if a person suffered significant pain by sitting
for more than 10 minutes, then
they should be considered unable to do so.
The AAT found that although at the date of hearing, Bunworth might have been
unable to sit for at least ten minutes without painkillers,
the question was
what was the situation at the date of claim and in the thirteen-week period that
The AAT considered the report of Dr O’Keefe dated 13 June 2013 which
stated that Bunworth could sit for half an hour. The evidence
was unclear as to
whether a painkiller was being taken at that point.
The AAT found the evidence of Dr Adam and Dr O’Keefe to be consistent
and also that the guidelines made it clear that the decision-maker
rely on self-reporting. The AAT found it was constrained to accept the
consistent medical evidence and that Bunworth did
not qualify for the DSP.
Other observations
The result of the AAT decision was that Bunworth would be required to persist
on newstart allowance. The AAT expressed no view as
to whether a new claim for
DSP would be successful.
Concern was expressed by Bunworth’s wife that her husband would have
‘trouble complying with activity requirements under
the Newstart program
if they were imposed insensitively’. The AAT assumed that any assessment
of Bunworth’s job capacity
would proceed on the basis of Dr Adam’s
opinion. His opinion was that ‘Bunworth is practically incapable of
notwithstanding that Bunworth did not attract twenty impairment
points. To avoid doubt, the AAT expressly preferred the report prepared
‘highly-credentialed and experienced medical practitioner’ over the
job capacity assessment.
Formal decision
The AAT set aside the decision under review and decided in substitution that
Bunworth did not qualify for the DSP.
