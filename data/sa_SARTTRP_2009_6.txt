Section 3 - Meaning of residential park tenancy agreement, sub-tenancy
agreement and site agreement
Turner v Ritchie & Hill (RP09/0009)
Tribunal finds an agreement at the Roxby Downs Olympic Dam Caravan Park is
neither a residential park tenancy agreement nor a site
agreement under the
Residential Parks Act but the premises are sufficiently permanent to be
“residential Premises” within
the meaning of the
Residential
Tenancies Act
- Residential Park Dispute
Turner v Ritchie & Hill (RP09/0009
The applicant purchases a dwelling located on a site in the Roxby Downs
Caravan Park under unknown terms without intending to reside
applicant rents the dwelling to the respondents. The applicant claims
compensation at the end of the agreement for unpaid
rent. The Tribunal finds
the agreement between the parties is not a residential park tenancy agreement
but is a residential tenancy
agreement and awards compensation under the
Residential Tenancies Act, 1995

RESIDENTIAL TENANCY AGREEMENT DETAILS

Period of Tenancy: Twelve months fixed term

SWORN EVIDENCE
was given in person by:
Landlord Melissa Turner
The tenant was given notice of the hearing. The tenant was not at the
The landlord’s evidence was that she “purchased” Site 47 of
the Roxby Downs Olympic Dam Caravan Park for a considerable
sum of money in
July/August 2007. It consisted of a site with a dwelling attached. The
dwelling is in part permanent and incapable
of being moved easily. It was
always her intention to sublet/rent the site. She never intended to reside
there. She purchased
it as an investment. I do not have sufficient evidence
before me to determine exactly what Ms Turner “purchased”. I
to believe there is no written agreement which defines the interest purchased by
her. On the evidence before me it appears
that in return for payment of the
money she obtained an agreement which entitles her to occupy a dwelling on Site
47 of the park
on terms and conditions which are not clear at this point.
The Roxby Downs Olympic Dam Caravan Park is in my view a Residential Park as
Residential Parks Act, 2007
(herein after referred
to as “the Act”). The Act was proclaimed and came into operation
(apart from Sections 18 and
43) on 3 November 2007. That is some three or four
months after Ms Turner “purchased” the site and dwelling.
Section 5 of the Act proscribes its application. The relevant part is
Section 5(1) and reads:-
“This Act does not apply to an agreement that
confers on a person a right to occupy a dwelling in a Residential Park unless
the dwelling is or is to be the person’s principle place of
residence”.
I find that the Act does not apply to the agreement between Ms Turner and the
Roxby Downs Olympic Dam Caravan Park.
Ms Turner entered into an agreement with Chad Ritchie and Tayla Hill (herein
after referred to as the tenants) to rent the property
from 17 November 2008 for
a twelve month fixed term. The agreement to rent the property was entered into
directly between Ms Turner
and the tenants.
Section 3 of the Act defines a Residential Park Site Agreement as an
agreement under which a
grants another person, for valuable
consideration, a right (which may, but need not, be an exclusive right) to
in the Residential Park and install or locate a dwelling on
the site, for residential purposes.
I find the agreement between Ms Turner and the tenants is not a Residential
Park Site Agreement. It is not an agreement between the
the tenants. It is not to occupy a site and install or locate a dwelling on the
Section 3 of the Act defines a residential park agreement as meaning:
“residential park tenancy agreement
(a) an agreement under which a park owner grants another person, for
valuable consideration, a right (which may, but need not, be
an exclusive right)
to occupy a site in the residential park, and a dwelling made available on the
site by the park owner, for residential
purposes; or
(b) an agreement (a
sub-tenancy agreement
) under which a
resident grants another person, for valuable consideration, a right (which may,
but need not, be an exclusive right)
to occupy the site in respect of which the
resident has a right of occupancy, and the dwelling on the site (whether a
dwelling made
available by the park owner or installed or located on the site by
the resident), for residential purposes;”
.Section 3 of the
Residential Parks Act
defines resident. “a resident
of a Residential Park means a person who is granted a right of occupancy under a
residential
park tenancy agreement or a residential park site agreement in
respect of the residential park, or a person to whom the right passes
assignment or operation of law and includes a prospective resident or former
I find that the agreement entered into by Ms Turner and the tenants is not a
residential park tenancy agreement because it is not
an agreement either between
and the tenants nor a resident and the tenants.
I have found that the agreement between Ms Turner and the Roxby Downs Olympic
Dam Caravan Park is not a residential park agreement
or a residential park site
agreement. It follows that Ms Turner does not fit the definition of
Based on the landlord’s evidence I find that the premises described as
Lot 47 Roxby Downs Olympic Dam Caravan Park, Roxby Downs
is a sufficiently
permanent and attached structure to be a residential premises as defined in
Residential Tenancies Act, 1995
I find that the agreement between Ms Turner and the tenants to be a tenancy
agreement which comes under the
Residential Tenancies Act, 1995
The tenant was given inspection sheets and an information brochure at the
beginning of the tenancy.
Ms Turner’s evidence (which I accept) is that the tenants ceased making
rental payments on 13 March 2009. They phoned the landlord
stating that they
may need to leave Roxby Downs on approximately 9 May 2009 because Ms
Hill’s mother had become ill. She served
a Form 2 notice on them on 7
April 2009 requiring vacant possession on or before 24 April 2009. She made
inquiries with the Manager
of the Roxby Downs Caravan Park subsequent to 24
April 2009 and was advised that the tenants had vacated. They had not notified
the park owner or the landlord (other than as set out above). Rent is paid to 1
March 2009 with a credit of $220.00. She seeks
compensation for rent from 2
March 2009 to 24 April 2009 inclusive. That is an amount of $2313.90. The
credit of $220.00 should
be deducted from that. In her application she sought
compensation of $2051.43. Given the need to notify the tenants of claims made
against them I am unable to award compensation exceeding the amount claimed. I
find the tenant liable to compensate the landlord
for outstanding rent in the
sum of $2051.43.
Based on the evidence of Ms Turner, I find the tenants have a liability of
$73.90 for electricity used by them during their occupation.
Again based on the
evidence of Ms Turner I find the tenants liable for the cost of $40.00 for
cleaning out the refrigerator.
I have found the tenants liable to pay compensation totalling $2165.33.
I will order that the bond be paid to the landlord. After deducting that
amount I will order the tenants to pay compensation of $965.33
