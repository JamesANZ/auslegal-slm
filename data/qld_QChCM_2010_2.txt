INTRODUCTION
[1] This is an application by Sergeant Hafner of the Queensland Police Service
pursuant to
Section 258
Youth Justice Act
Section 258
provides the Court may call on a parent of a child to show cause
why the parent should not pay compensation where a child has been
found guilty
of a personal or property offence.
[3] The application relates to the child DA aged 14 years.
[4] The term “parent” for the purpose of
Section 258
guardian of the child. DA’s mother KD, his father ET and his carer CD
have been regarded as parents for the purpose
of this application. The
Justice Act
does not define the term “guardian”. The term is defined
in the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian
“guardian, of a child, means any of the following persons—(a) a
person who is recognised in law as having all
the duties, powers,
responsibilities and authority relating to the child that, by law, parents have
relating to their children;
(b) a person in whose favour a parenting order is
in force under the
Family Law Act 1975
(Cwlth); (c) a carer of the child under
Child Protection Act 1999
; (d) a person who is entitled to the custody of
the child under the
Adoption Act 2009
[5] On the 4
of May 2010 DA was sentenced to four
months detention and was to be released on a 3 month conditional release order
for two offences
of enter premises and commit an indictable offence by means of
a break; however DA would not agree to the terms of the conditional
order and was therefore detained.
[6] On the 4
of May 2010 I called upon CD and KD to
show cause why one or both of them should not pay compensation to DA’s
[7] Compensation is sought on behalf of the Complainant hotel in the sum of
[8] Evidence has been by way of sworn affidavit filed on behalf of the Applicant
and the First and Second Respondents.
[9] CD (37) referred to in submissions as the cultural grandmother of DA has the
day to day care of DA. She is in receipt of Centrelink
[10] KD (34) is the mother of DA. She is in receipt of Centrelink benefits.
[11] Sergeant Hafner submits (see paragraphs (h) and (i) of his affidavit) that
DA has clearly had inadequate supervision as evidenced
by his offending
behaviour and various breaches of bail conditions. DA’s history is not
especially bad. He has however been
before the Court on a number of occasions
over the last twelve months.
[12] It is time the Court drew a line in the sand and made parents realise they
carry a heavy burden of parental responsibility towards
their children. The
community demands it. Mrs Dooley from the local Justice group told me when DA
was before the Court on the 8
March 2010 that local
businesses are sick and tired of the amount of break and enters that are
occurring, most of which are focussed
on alcohol.
[13] The Complainant in the substantive offences is the Graham Hotel, one of the
favourite break and enter targets of criminals in
Mareeba. It has been broken
into on numerous occasions and had substantial amounts of alcohol stolen. The
evidence before me does
not indicate whether DA may have been dealt with for
breaking into the hotel on any previous occasions.
[14] On the 23
of August 2010 I called on DA’s
natural father ET to show cause why he should not be ordered to pay
compensation.
[15] ET has filed no material in answer to the show cause notice.
[16] The Prosecution has filed no more material in respect of ET.
[17] The Respondents, CD and KD, have not filed any more material in respect of
[18] From the evidence before me ET was not aware he was the father of DA until
DA was 7 months of age. It appears his involvement
with DA has been minimal.
[19] Mrs Dooley did advise me on the 23
2010 that DA does “hang” with ET.
[20] It would appear ET has completely abandoned his responsibilities in respect
of DA. ET has not filed any material in these
proceedings. It is at odds with
common sense that a person who has completely abrogated his parental
responsibilities should not
be held responsible for the actions of his
offspring, especially where as in this case ET has apparently not acted in any
provide for DA.
[21] Prima facie I am of the view that ET has contributed to the fact the
offence happened by his not adequately supervising DA.
[22] So far as the evidence before me is concerned it is generally
inadequate.
[23] On the 23
of August I advised the parties of the
decision of Judge Wall DCJ in the matter of the
Queen v CB and KE
pointed out in that matter evidence was taken and witnesses cross-examined.
None of the parties in this application asked to
call any evidence or
cross-examine any deponent. It may be that I have made an error in procedure in
originally calling for affidavit
material instead of listing the matter for a
formal hearing.
[24] It is my belief now that procedurally upon the return of the show cause
notice I should have listed the matter as a hearing.
This matter has proceeded
on the basis of the filing of affidavits by the Respondents and the taking of
submissions.
[25] The Act is silent on the procedures to be adopted in determining the show
cause and the method of calling evidence, other than
confirming the proceeding
is a civil proceeding. The Court does however have to be satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt of the matters
set out in Section 258(1).
[26] Sergeant Hafner says in paragraph 4 (l)
“The only reasonable
inference that can be drawn from the submissions outlined above is that the
parent/guardian of the child
have contributed to the fact that the offence
happened by not adequately supervising the child, when the ongoing history of
the child’s
offending behaviour and breaches of bail curfew conditions
over an extended period of time demanded a greater degree of supervision
restriction on the child’s movements (particularly at night time), than
was exercised.”
[27] In response KD says in paragraph 9
“DA and Algin come to see me
occasionally. I have tried to influence the behaviour of DA and Algin to ensure
that they stay
on a straight path. However DA in particular is not interested
in what I try to tell him. I know Denise also tries very hard to
change his ways but he doesn’t seem to listen”
This is a rather
pathetic statement of parental responsibility.
[28] KD does not depose to any of the history of her parenting of DA especially
the supervision, guidance, encouragement, and discipline
she utilises in
parenting DA.
[29] KD provides no detailed statement of financial circumstances that would
assist in determining her financial status, other than
she is on Centrelink
benefits and all her money is spent on food and accommodation for the other four
children in her care.
[30] KD appears content to have abrogated her parental responsibilities
informally to CD. The burden of parental responsibility
cast upon a parent is I
think higher than that exhibited by KD.
[31] KD is to a lesser extent in the same boat as ET. She appears to have
nothing to do with the day to day care of DA and appears
content to abrogate her
parental responsibilities in favour of DA residing with CD.
[32] CD however is in the position of having no formal authority over DA. The
only authority CD would exercise over DA would be
cultural, but that does not
appear to have any impact on DA’s offending ways.
[33] Whereas ET has never had any parenting role in respect of DA KD I assume
was responsible for placing DA with CD. KD does according
to her affidavit have
some contact with DA.
[34] Prima facie I am of the view that KD has contributed to the fact the
offence happened by not adequately supervising DA.
[35] CD says in paragraph 9
“I try to do my best for the children in my
care but DA in particular is a real problem for me. I speak to him constantly
his offending behaviour. I have told him that it is wrong and that the
consequences of his offending will lead to detention if he
does not mend his
ways. When I tell him this, he seems to listen but it doesn’t seem to
sink in at all.”
[36] Once again this is an inadequate statement of CD’s supervisory
[37] There is no suggestion that as a consequence of DA’s actions of
leaving the house CD takes any steps to bring him home.
One would think a
caring responsible person would, immediately the child’s absence was
discovered try to locate him and/or
seek assistance from the responsible
agencies to find him. There is no suggestion of any discipline by CD towards
DA. There is
no mention of education. There is no detailed statement of
financial circumstances other than she is on Centrelink benefits and
money is spent on food and accommodation for the children in her care.
[38] From the submissions received it is apparent that CD is not DA’s
grandmother. The arrangement whereby CD looks after
DA is an informal one, the
only formality appearing to be that she receives Centrelink benefits to care for
him. Neither KD nor
ET assists financially in DA’s up-keep.
[39] I do not wish to be unduly critical of CD as she provides a home to DA and
other children, however given DA’s offending
behaviour I am prima facie of
the view that CD has contributed to the fact the offence happened by not
adequately supervising DA.
[40] Although the arrangement with CD is informal I would urge CD to adopt
standards and set boundaries for the children she elects
to take into her
[41] Notwithstanding my concerns about the lack of control exercised by CD over
DA I am not satisfied CD falls within the definition
of Parent for the purposes
of this application. The application in so far as CD is concerned is
[42] It may be that the Department of Child Safety should investigate whether DA
is a child in need of protection and take appropriate
measures to ensure he
receives suitable lawful placement and supervision.
[43] KD and ET are the parents of DA. They have both sought to ignore their
parental responsibilities towards DA. Maybe KD thought
that by placing DA with
CD she had fulfilled her obligations to him. I do not think this is so as the
placement is informal and
CD exercises no control over DA, and has no lawful
capacity to do so. The relationship between CD and DA appears to be no more
that of a boarder.
[44] Upon a consideration of the evidence before me I am satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that –
Compensation for the offence should
be paid to the Complainant, and
KD has contributed to the fact the offence happened by not adequately
supervising DA, and
ET has contributed to the fact the offence happened by not adequately
supervising DA.
[45] In determining whether it is reasonable for KD to pay compensation I have
regard to her financial circumstances. This area
has not been explored very
well in the material before me. In the matter of CB & KE the parents were in
receipt of benefits,
but did have some small surplus of funds. The
consideration of whether it is reasonable for KD to pay compensation is not I
limited to a consideration of her financial circumstances, however Section
259 (9) requires the Court to have regard to the parent’s
capacity to pay,
and the effect the order would have on the parent’s capacity to provide
for dependants, when considering the
amount to be paid by the parent by way of
compensation.
[46] KD is in receipt of $1,000.00 per fortnight by way of benefits. She has
nothing left after the payment of household expenses.
[47] I cannot in the circumstances be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it
is reasonable that KD should be ordered to pay compensation
for the offence.
[48] The application in respect of KD is dismissed.
[49] In determining whether it is reasonable for ET to pay compensation I have
regard to the circumstances of his involvement with
DA as I understand them. ET
has had no supervisory role at all in respect of DA. He does not contribute to
DA’s upbringing
morally, socially, culturally or financially. On the one
hand it may be thought in such circumstances ET as DA’s father should
shoulder a high degree of responsibility for DA’s bad behaviour. However
in circumstances where ET has had nothing to do with
DA, and I expect has not
been invited to exercise any parental influence over him, it is difficult to
determine that it is reasonable
he should be ordered to pay compensation.
[50] I cannot in the circumstances be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it
is reasonable that ET should be ordered to pay compensation
for the offence.
[51] The application in respect of ET is dismissed.
