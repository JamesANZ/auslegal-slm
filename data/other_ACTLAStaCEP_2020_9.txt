2. Planning in the
Australian Capital Territory
Introduction
2.1 This chapter outlines the planning framework in the Australian Capital
Territory (ACT) and briefly outlines the evolution of the
Territory Plan from
its inception, through a series of reviews and restructures.
Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act
(Cth) sets out the overarching legal framework for the planning of, and
management of the land in, the ACT.
It establishes the National Capital Authority, one of the functions of which is
to prepare and administer a National Capital
The objective of the National
Capital Plan is to ensure that Canberra and the Territory are planned and
developed in accordance with
their national
significance.
Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act
also provided for the ACT Legislative Assembly to make laws to
establish a Territory planning authority, and to confer on that authority
function of preparing and administering a Territory
These requirements were
incorporated into the
Interim Planning Act 1990
and subsequently, with
expanded environmental assessment and heritage provisions, into
(Planning and Environment) Act 1991
2.4 In 2008, as part of the reform of the ACT planning system, the
(Planning and Environment) Act 1991
was replaced by the
Planning and
Development Act 2007
which includes the provision for the Planning and Land
and the Territory
2.5 The Territory Plan commenced operation on 31 March 2008 and provides the
policy framework for the administration of planning in
The object of the territory plan is to ensure, in a manner not inconsistent with
the national capital plan, the planning and development
of the ACT provide the
people of the ACT with an attractive, safe and efficient environment in which to
live, work and have their
recreation.
2.6 Under section 50 of the Act, the:
Territory, the Executive, a Minister or a territory authority must not do any
act, or approve the doing of an act, that is inconsistent
with the territory
Act requires the Territory Plan to set out the planning principles and policies
for giving effect to its objective in a way
that gives effect to sustainability
principles, including policies that contribute to achieving a healthy
environment in the ACT.
2.8 The Territory Plan includes:
 a statement of strategic directions;
 objectives and development tables applying to each zone;
 a series of general, development and precinct codes; and
 structure plans and concept plans for the development of future
urban areas.
2.9 The Territory Plan graphically represents the applicable land use zones
under the following categories:
 Residential;
 Commercial;
 Industrial;
 Community Facility;
 Parks and Recreation;
 Transport and Services; and
 Non-Urban.
2.10 Recognising that land use policies may change over time, the Act
provides for variations to the Territory Plan, which are prepared
Planning and Land Authority, currently under the auspices of the Environment,
Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate
(the Directorate), for
stakeholder consultation and
2.11 Under the Act, the Minister must refer draft plan variation documents,
within 5 working days of the notification of the public
availability
to an appropriate
committee of the ACT Legislative Assembly (the Assembly) for consideration and
2.12 The Minister must not take action in relation to the draft plan
variation until the committee of the Assembly has reported on
has decided not to report on
has not informed the
minister within 20 working days of the referral as to whether it will prepare a
or the committee of the
Assembly has not reported on the draft plan variation by the end of the period
of six months starting the
day after the day on which it was referred to the
2.13 The Minister must take any recommendation of the committee into account
before making his decision in relation to the draft plan
If the Minister
approves it, the proposed plan variation and associated documents will be
presented to the Assembly.
Unless wholly or partially rejected by the Assembly, on a motion for which
notice has been given within five sitting days of the
plan variation being
presented to the Assembly, the plan variation will commence on the date
nominated by the Minister.
3. The Draft Variation
Draft Variation to the Territory Plan 363 - Curtin group centre and
adjacent residential areas: Zone changes and amendments to the
Curtin precinct
map and code
(the Draft Variation) seeks to vary the Territory Plan and
current Curtin precinct map and code in line with recommendations made
Curtin Group Centre Master Plan (2018) (the Master Plan). The Draft Variation
proposes the following changes to zones within
the Curtin Group Centre and the
surrounding medium density residential areas:
• limiting building heights around the Group Centre’s central
courtyard to single storey;
• permitting up to five storeys to the south and north west of the
central courtyard;
• permitting up to six storeys for the Statesman Hotel site (Block 6
Section 62 Curtin) and part of the adjacent parking areas;
• permitting residential development in the medium density residential
zones adjoining the centre up to six storeys;
• rezoning a parcel of unleased land at the south west corner of the
Carruthers Street roundabout from residential/commercial
zones to urban open
space (Block 7 Section 63 Curtin);
• rezoning the southern part of the centre from commercial core zone to
commercial business zone; and
• generally prohibiting residential uses within the commercial core
area at the ground floor level, to encourage an active streetscape
and in public
3.2 The Draft Variation has interim
Planning and Development Act 2007
Draft Variation applies during the defined period, starting from the day when
the Draft Variation given to the Minister is notified
(the notification day). In
this case, from 12 March 2020.
The defined period, and the interim effect of the Draft Variation, ends on the
day the earliest of the following occurs:
I. the day the plan variation, or part of it, commences;
II. the day the variation is rejected by the Legislative Assembly;
III. the day the variation is withdrawn under
(2)(b)(v) or
IV. the period of 18 months after the notification day
3.4 During the defined period the Territory, the Executive, the Minister or a
territory authority ‘must not do or approve anything
that would be
inconsistent with Territory Plan as if it were amended by the draft
variation’. In cases where there is inconsistency
between the Territory
Plan and the draft variation, ‘then the draft variation takes precedence
for the extent of the
inconsistency’.
3.5 The sites affected by the Draft Variation are the Curtin Group Centre and
surrounding medium density residential
3.6 The Group Centre is located approximately 3km north of the Woden Town
Centre and 300m west of the Yarra Glen and Carruthers Street
interchange. The
centre is bounded by Carruthers Street to the north, Theodore Street to the east
and Strangways Street to the west
3.7 The Group Centre is predominately single storey commercial developments
with awnings surrounding a central courtyard. Buildings
at the northwest and
southeast corners of the centre are two storeys, with the southwest and
northeast sections dominated by surface
3.8 To the east of the Group Centre are detached single dwellings, to the
northeast and south are multi-unit developments, whilst
to the northeast and
south there are community facilities and urban open
3.9 The flowing Territory map zones currently apply to the Draft
• Commercial Core – CZ1 Core
• Commercial Business – CZ2 Business
• Commercial Services – CZ3 Services
• Medium Density Residential Land – RZ4 Medium Density
Residential
• Community Facilities Zone – CFZ Community Facilities
• Transport and Services – TSZ1
3.10 In addition to general codes which may apply, the following codes
currently apply to the Group Centre under the Territory Plan:
• Commercial Zone development code;
• Residential Zones development code; and
• the Curtin precinct map and
Changes to the Territory
3.11 Land in the ACT is divided into sections and blocks.
3.12 Planning ‘zones’ are applied to land and the zoning
determines what kind of development is allowed on the land.
3.13 As illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the Draft Variation would make
the following changes to the existing Territory Plan
• an area of CZ1 to the south of the centre between the existing CZ1
zone and the CZ2 zone further south will be rezoned CZ2;
• an area of the RZ4 section on the southern side of Carruthers Street
and an area of the adjoining CZ3 area on Carruthers Street
will be rezoned PRZ1
– Urban Open Space.
- Current Territory Plan
- Proposed Territory Plan
Amendments to the Curtin Precinct Map
3.14 Precinct maps identify areas where there are additional planning
3.15 As illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the Draft Variation would make
the following changes to the existing Curtin Precinct
• the addition of RC2 (rules and criteria) zones to the east and west
of the centre to control residential developments;
• the removal of the MT1 and MT2 (merit track) zones currently dividing
section 62 and their consolidation with blocks 1 and
2 section 63 as an RC1
• The removal of block 7 section 63 at the northwest corner of the
existing RC1 area from the RC1
- Current Curtin Precinct
- Proposed Curtin Precinct
Amendments to the Curtin Precinct Code
3.16 As outlined in the Territory Plan, Precinct Codes provide additional
planning, design and environmental controls for individual
blocks and may
contain references to provisions in other codes.
3.17 Precinct codes contain additional rules and/or criteria for particular
blocks or parcels identified on the precinct map, to be
read in conjunction with
the relevant development code. Each element has one or more rules and, unless
the respective rule is mandatory,
each rule has an associated criterion. Rules
provide quantitative, or definitive, controls whereas criteria are chiefly
qualitative
3.18 The Draft Variation would make changes to the existing Curtin Precinct
Code, including:
• Prohibiting development on the existing surface carparking in the
centre (R3);
• Providing for environmental protections from noise and contamination
for nominated areas (R5 and R6);
• Identifying maximum building heights, setbacks and active frontages
for sites in the group centre (R7, R8, R9, R14, R15, R21
and R22), including
providing for solar access into the central courtyard (R10, R12 and R13);
• Providing for pedestrian access through the main areas of the centre
(R20) and the provision of awnings for buildings fronting
primary active
frontage areas (R27); and
• The addition of building height, setback and access controls for new
RC2 areas to the east, west and northwest of the centre
(r29, R30 and
Consultation by the
Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate
3.19 The Directorate released the Draft Variation for public comment on 7
June 2019. The closing date for comments was 21 August 2019.
The Directorate
received a total of 19 written submissions, including two late submissions.
3.20 Key issues of concern raised in the public submissions included:
• Changes to the proposed statement of desired character to include
references like ‘an active and inclusive meeting place,’
human scale urban village’ and ‘a sunlit central
courtyard’;
• Reduction of building heights to maintain views from the group centre
to Red Hill;
• Additional solar access protection for the central courtyard to
prevent overshadowing;
• Increase to building setbacks along Strangways Street and Theodore
Street; and
• Additional tree protection in the group
3.21 In response to public comments, changes were made to the exhibited
version of the Draft Variation. These included:
• Excluding the whole of block 19 section 62 Curtin from area
‘a’ in Figure 2 of the proposed precinct map and code;
• Including references to ‘the desired character’ in
criterion C9 b);
• Removing the reference to ‘future’ from criterion C9 d)
• Changing the reference from ‘building facing’ to
‘building directly fronting’ in rule R13;
• Clarifying wording in rule R14 to better reflect setback
requirements;
• Amending rule R20 and Figure 4 (of the proposed precinct map and
code) to refer to pedestrian areas as ‘pedestrian priority
instead of ‘pedestrian only areas’;
• Excluding block 20 section 62 Curtin from the ‘pedestrian
priority area’ in Figure 4 of the proposed precinct
map and code; and
• Adding a mandatory rule R7 for a maximum building height of two
storeys (maximum 9 metres) to the commercial CZ1 core zone,
other than where
alternative building heights are identified in the precinct
Comments on Consultation
3.22 The Committee notes that given the large amount of planning reports,
codes, plans and strategies, it is difficult for individuals
and community
organisations to participate meaningfully in public consultation.
3.23 In their submission the Curtin Residents’ Association (Curtin RA)
contrasted the ‘long drawn and wide consultation’
for the drafting
of the Master Plan with the processes that followed, including ‘[f]ailures
in the community consultation process,
resulting in Plans and Codes that omit
aspects that are generally consistent with development, although not necessarily
desires of a small number of particular developers’.
3.24 The Curtin RA further noted the ‘[l]oss of transparency in the
process of consultation, plan drafting, and development
assessment and
conditional
acceptance’.
Understanding the Draft
3.25 The Territory Plan is a complex document. Draft Variations to the
Territory Plan can reflect this complexity and it can be difficult
persons to understand exactly what the existing rules are and how they will be
changed by a Draft Variation.
3.26 The Committee notes that extensive sourcing and cross matching or
relevant documentation is required to ascertain what has been
amended in the
Territory Plan or what is being referenced within the Draft Variation. This is
beyond the capacity of many in the
community, particularly with changes to map
references; inconsistent terminology and a lack of explanatory notes.
3.27 Canberra Town Planning pointed to the need to ensure that precinct codes
are easily understood: ‘A precinct code that is
too complex, or imposes
restrictions that are too onerous, will not make Curtin an attractive place to
do business’.
They further
pointed to the specific issue of solar access where regulations could be
simplified to achieve desired results:
There are several rules and criteria that seem to be seeking to protect solar
access to the courtyard. It would be better if a single
metric could be
identified that would achieve this outcome and not be so
Recommendation
Committee recommends that, subject to the following recommendations, Draft
Variation 363:
Curtin group centre and adjacent residential areas: Zone
changes and amendments to the Curtin precinct map and code
Group Centre Master Plan
4.1 Master plans are a key element in the government’s implementation
of the 2012 Planning Strategy.
Through master plans, the government seeks to ‘manage and deliver
responsible, integrated growth in appropriate
locations’.
4.2 A master plan is a non-statutory document that ‘sets out how a
particular area can (as opposed to will) develop and redevelop
future’. A master plan provides ‘a high level plan intended to set
out objectives and strategies to manage development
and change over time’
and ‘defines what is important about a place and how its character and
quality can be conserved,
improved and enhanced’. A master plans ‘is
not a detailed
4.3 Master plans are prepared by the Directorate, which also periodically
reviews them ‘to ensure their currency’.
Community and industry groups
are engaged during the preparation and review processes for master plans to
ensure that ‘local
issues and community values are
considered’.
4.4 The implementation of a master plan may involve the following
• Territory Plan variations;
• Sale of Territory-owned land;
• Capital works;
• Realisation of industry opportunities identified within the master
• Further community
consultation.
4.5 Preparation for the Curtin Group Centre Master Plan (the Master Plan)
began in April 2015 with the first stage of community engagement
and the release
of information posters. At this stage of community engagement, the government
‘outlined key planning issues
and sought feedback on the preliminary
challenges and opportunities that exist in the centre’. The second stage
of community
engagement run from November 2015 to February 2016 and
‘sought feedback on the draft master
4.6 Whilst the completion of a master plan usually involves a two-stage
community consultation and engagement process, due to the
community interest in the recommendations of the draft master plan, including
new opportunities being identified for
the centre and the announcement of light
rail from the city centre to Woden’, the Directorate undertook two
additional stages
of community
engagement.
4.7 The third stage of community engagement involved the government
establishing a community panel ‘to discuss development and
redevelopment
opportunities at the centre’. The community panel met in July, August and
November 2017 with ‘representatives
of the community, lessees, traders,
developers and government ‘. At the final meeting of the community
engagement panel, revised
master plan master plan diagrams were presented for
building heights adjacent to the existing central courtyard were
contested’.
4.8 The fourth and final stage of community engagement was conducted between
April and June 2018 and ‘sought feedback on the
revisions to the draft
master plan in response to the outcomes of the community panel
The Master Plan
was finalised following this stage of community engagement.
4.9 According to the ACT Government, the master plan:
...provides an overview and background analysis of the study area. It recommends
a vision, spatial framework, planning principles
and strategies that respond to
existing and potential development pressures in the centre. Key strategies and
recommendations are
based on the background analysis and community engagement
Understanding the
relationship between the Draft Variation and the Curtin Group Centre Master
4.10 The Committee notes that a number of submissions to both the inquiry and
to the Directorate during the public consultation phase
raised concerns about
parts of the Draft Variation and the proposed changes to the precinct code not
complying with the Master Plan.
4.11 The Curtin RA, for instance, highlighted issues ‘where the
planning process has failed to translate the long drawn and
wide consultation
and drafting of the Master Plan to the Draft Variation’ and the
‘[f]ailure to translate excellent planning
for the public domain at the
Master Plan level into the codes of the Territory
4.12 Specifically, the Curtin Residents’ Association highlighted three
major areas where they saw inconsistencies between the
intentions of the Master
Plan and the detail contained in the proposed Draft Variation:
1. Statement of
Desired Character
in the Draft Variation;
2. Control of
overshadowing
for development in the Curtin Group Centre
in the Draft Variation; and
3. Set-back on Strangways
4.13 These matters are discussed in further detail in the following
5. Key Issues
Desired Character
5.1 Contributors to both the inquiry and the Directorate’s consultation
phase noted the importance of including a
desired character
within the precinct code, but also highlighted where they believed this
statement, as it appeared in the Draft Variation,
had fallen short of community
expectations.
desired character
statement appears in the proposed Curtin
Precinct Code as follows:
• A busy community hub that offers a broad range of services and
facilities to diverse usergroups in the area
• Provide sustainable and high-quality housing options to attract
residents to the area
• Be an attractive place to do business for local retailers and other
• Provide opportunities for evening activities, as well as informal
recreation, community and leisure uses
• Pedestrians and cyclists will be able to access the centre safely and
efficiently and be connected to nearby facilities such
as schools, aged care
accommodation and the future City to Woden light rail on Yarra
5.3 The Curtin RA submitted:
The Precinct Code does not contain sufficiently strong description in its key
elements of the character that is strongly expressed
in the Master Plan, to
ensure that it implements the aims of the Master Plan. These elements were
strongly expressed in community
consultation and subsequent government
Elsum similarly noted that the ‘statement of
desired character
the recommended version of the Curtin Precinct Code does not incorporate key
elements of very high value to the
community’.
5.5 The Curtin RA, while acknowledging that the
desired character
statement contained in the proposed Curtin Precinct Code is derived from the
Master Plan and the associated community consultation,
argued that this is
‘only part of what the plan identifies as the character of the
Centre’. What is missing, according
to the Curtin RA, ‘is the
motivating and guiding
urban village
character human
5.6 Citing relevant examples from the Master Plan, the Curtin RA asserted
that the ‘key messages here are consistent:
• People/community-centred planning and development
• ‘human scale’ / ‘village feel’
• The very high value of the sun-lit central courtyard
• Support for higher buildings (greater than 2 storeys) away from the
immediate vicinity of the core area centred around the
courtyard.’
5.7 The Curtin RA submitted that the following three elements should be added
desired character
statement in the proposed Curtin Precinct Code
to better reflect community sentiment:
• Be an active and inclusive meeting place;
• A human scale urban village; and
• It is to provide a sunlight central
5.8 In a similar fashion, Ian Elsum suggested that the following statement
also be added to the
desired character
statement in the proposed Curtin
Precinct Code:
it is a successful urban village with a sunlit central courtyard both of which
contribute to making it an active and inclusive social
meeting place for the
Committee Comment
5.9 The Committee supports the inclusion of a
desired character
statement in the proposed Curtin Precinct Code.
5.10 In a recent report on development application processes, the Committee
noted that there is often a disconnect between development
application
assessment and design and character elements identified in master plans and
other similar planning
5.11 That report recommended that ‘the Territory Plan Review rectify
the disconnect between the Development Application process,
as per the Territory
Plan, and key design and character elements that are articulated in master
plans, planning refreshes and zone
objectives’ (Recommendation
The Committee believes that
the inclusion of appropriate
desired character
statements will go part
way to resolving the widely-felt disconnect between master plans, and similar
documents, and draft variations.
5.12 The Committee agrees with submissions that the
desired character
statement should be expanded to better reflect the Curtin Group Centre Master
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that the
Directorate expand the proposed
desired character
statement in the Curtin
Precinct Code to include human scale, sunlight to the central courtyard and the
provision of attractive and
busy public places more generally.
5.14 Canberra Town Planning informed the Committee of a potential issue
associated with plot ratios in the proposed Curtin Precinct
The Commercial Zones code identifies a maximum plot ratio within group centres
of 100%, with criteria-based assessment being available
(R46/C46). In the
absence of any controls relating to plot ratio in the precinct code, it is
likely that this control will need to
be addressed by any future development
further elaborated:
Where the precinct code is providing for opportunities for 6 storey development,
this would result in plot ratios much higher than
100% and could result in
considerable planning risk to the proponent. This is especially relevant given
that the plot ratio of the
proposed redevelopment of 44 Curtin Place was one of
the reasons given for refusing the original 2016 development application. To
reduce risk to future development proposals that are consistent with the
intentions of the master plan and precinct code, the precinct
code should
include a control relating to plot ratios that are consistent with the height
controls and intended development
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the
Directorate consider whether it is necessary to include plot ratio controls for
development sites
likely to exceed a 100 per cent plot ratio.
Surface parking
5.17 Rule 3 (R3) of the proposed Curtin Precinct Code, relates to the
existing surface car parking in the Group Centre. It prohibits
development on
these areas (as shown in Figure 1 of the proposed Curtin Precinct Code)
‘except any associated works to the
surface car
5.18 Canberra Town Planning took issue with the inflexibility of this rule,
arguing that:
Rule 3 seems to be at odds with the intention to move towards more sustainable
and active transport. Should the car parking not be
required in the future, the
only way to do anything else with this land would be to first complete a
Territory Plan variation. It
cannot even be converted to parkland. Given that
the current variation has taken several years to complete, this seems to be
unnecessarily
inflexible.
Committee Comment
5.19 The Committee agrees with the Canberra Town Planning submission that the
proposed parking controls (R3) are too restrictive and
may impact on future
needs such as landscaping, footpaths and encroachments from surrounding
commercial development such as entry
structures.
5.20 The Committee notes that more flexible controls have been used in
previous draft variations it has considered and is of the view
that these would
not cause the issues resulting from the inflexibility of R3 of the Draft
5.21 The Committee believes that Rule 4, Criteria 4 of the Mawson Precinct
Code offers a superior approach to that of R3 in the proposed
Curtin Precinct
5.22 Rule 4 (R4) of the Mawson Precinct Code states:
This rule applies to the shaded areas shown on figure 1.
Development complies with all of the following:
a) the existing number of car parking spaces is retained on the site and made
available for public use at all times
b) provides car parking that is generated by the development on site in
accordance with the Parking and Vehicular Access General
Code in addition to the
spaces required by item
5.23 Criteria
4 (C4) of the Mawson Precinct Code states:
Development meets all of the following:
a) in accordance with the Parking and Vehicular Access General Code, there is
enough car parking for the needs of the centre as a
b) the development does not adversely affect the overall function of the centre
in terms of economic, social, traffic and parking
and urban design
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the
Directorate change the proposed parking controls currently proposed in Rule 3 to
rules and criteria
similar to that contained in Rule 4 - Criteria 4 of the
Mawson Precinct Code.
Sunlight to the central
5.25 Contributors to the inquiry, together with
public submissions to the Directorate’s consultation phase, highlighted
importance of the Group Centre’s sunlit central courtyard to the
Curtin community.
5.26 The Curtin RA informed the Committee that:
Solar access to the central courtyard, ensuring it is light-filled, is critical
to its role as a community space and to the attraction
of Curtin as a place for
shopping, cafes, meeting and
this context the Curtin RA objected to the proposed height restrictions in the
proposed Curtin Precinct Code, which would
apply to developments in the south
and southwest of the Group Centre, and would allow for heights that are the
lesser of 5 storeys
and 18 metres. The Curtin RA objected on the grounds that
this may impact solar access to the courtyard:
Buildings of this height in these locations would contribute to overshadowing of
the central courtyard in a period of high use (the
latter half of the afternoon
in spring, summer and autumn) and be in stark conflict with the low-scale, urban
village character of
the Group Centre that is highly valued by the
community...
Curtin RA’s primary concern relating to overshadowing of the central
courtyard was the Directorate’s methodology
for assessing solar access.
The Curtin RA argued:
...the recommended draft variation is not satisfactory because assessing solar
access (overshadowing) of the central courtyard only
at “winter solstice
between 9:00am and 2:30pm” does not reflect actual use of the courtyard by
5.29 Elaborating
on this, the Curtin RA submitted that:
The intent of the controls for solar access for the central courtyard is to
enable and promote social activities and community use
of this vital public
space. Assessing solar access only at winter solstice between 9:00am and 2:30pm
does not enable this goal to
order to reflect actual patterns of use, the Curtin RA recommended that Rule 10
(applying to solar access to the central courtyard)
be amended to replace
“winter solstice between 9:00am and 2:30pm” with “spring
equinox (22 September) between 9:00am
5.31 Following the public consultation phase, the Directorate responded to
this suggestion by noting that:
The specified times between 9:00am and 2:30pm enable an appropriate balance to
be achieved to allow for redevelopment to occur, while
maintaining a high level
of solar access to the central courtyard throughout the year. The reason that
solar access is tested at
the winter solstice is because it is considered to be
the ‘worst case’ scenario and when sunlight is most desirable
the coolest part of the
Curtin RA questioned this assertion on the following grounds:
This is often
true: as the sun moves across the sky on an arc further
towards the south as the season changes from winter to summer, places that
not overshadowed through a particular period of the day at the winter solstice
will be overshadowed at other times of...other
seasons and worst case
overshadowing from the point of view of peoples’ use of a place may well
occur at time other than winter
Curtin RA provided the following justification for replacing the winter solstice
with the spring equinox as a more appropriate
date for assessing overshadowing
of the central courtyard:
Community use of the central courtyard – its role as a safe, protected
meeting and gathering place – is highest in autumn
and spring when it is
neither as cold as mid-winter nor as hot as in high summer when the sunlight is
too intense.
Consequently, the spring equinox is a better date than mid-winter for assessing
the effect of overshadowing. Controlling to the spring
equinox would also
provide sufficient control of overshadowing in
Curtin RA also provided the following justification for shifting the timeframe
for assessing overshadowing from ‘9:00am
to 2:30pm’ to ‘9:00am
to 3:30pm’:
Limiting the assessment of overshadowing to the morning (after 9am) and early
afternoon (up until 2:30pm) ignores the critical role
the courtyard plays as a
safe and attractive place for children and teen-agers to meet after school and
socialise, often while parents
and carers are shopping. This contributes to
making the period after 3pm one of the busiest times of the day for use of the
Consequently, a period after 3pm is a critical time for ensuring
there is good solar access in the central
Committee Comment
5.35 The Committee notes that this is at a minimum the third time it has
addressed the issue of sunlight to public spaces in a report,
with previous
consideration in the reports for draft variations relating to Woden Town
and Mawson Group
. It is clear that this is
a recurring issue that needs to be addressed in the Territory Plan for all
centres in Canberra, not just
on a case-by-case basis as master plans or
Territory Draft Variations are drafted.
5.36 The Committee sees merit in the argument made in submissions that in
Canberra, the spring and autumn equinoxes may be more relevant
times of year for
assessing solar access. At the equinoxes, people are out in Canberra’s
public spaces seeking to enjoy the
sun. In mid-winter, the cold weather deters
people from spending long periods in the public squares and courtyards in our
Changing the season at which sunlight is assessed could in many cases
allow more development, while also better protecting sunlight
when it is most
valued by the community.
Recommendation 5
The Committee recommends that the
Directorate consider, as part of the Territory Plan Review, options for
protecting sunlight for
public spaces that address the times of day and year
when sunlight is most valued by the community, and introduces protections that
will apply in all group and town centres across Canberra rather than in
selective centres.
Recommendation 6
The Committee recommends that the
Directorate amend the Draft Variation so as to ensure the central courtyard
receives full sunlight
between 9:00am and 3:30pm on the spring equinox.
Strangways Street
5.39 Submissions to both the inquiry and the Directorate’s public
consultation phase raised issues with the setbacks applied
to Strangways
5.40 On this issue, the Curtin RA pointed out that the Curtin Group Centre
Master Plan shows ‘that a 3 metre setback for buildings
is essential to
enable planting of large canopy shade
5.41 However, the Curtin RA indicated in their submission, that the Draft
Variation allows for zero setback along Strangways Street
for commercial uses
(Figure 3 of the draft precinct
This, according to the
Curtin RA ‘is inconsistent with the tree-lined pedestrian way model of
Strangways St spelled out in
They further noted
A reasonable set-back (even three metres) is not inconsistent with commercial
use, and would provide for deep rooted trees etc. This
is desirable both in
terms of the general expressions of the Curtin Group Centre Master Plan and for
current policies to promote
the enhancement of the urban tree
Committee Comment
5.42 The Committee agrees with the Curtin RA that it is highly desirable to
leave space for full-sized street trees on Strangways
Street in front of both
residential and commercial development (see Rule 14 and the area shown as
‘C1’ in Figure 3 in
the draft precinct code). However, it is also of
the view that commercial development needs to directly front the footpath to
commercial space that is able to attract customers. A compromise needs to
be found that meets both needs.
5.43 The Committee is of the view that one option that could be considered is
for a 3 metre setback with the requirement that the
entire 3 metres is paved so
that to customers, the commercial space appears to abut the footpath.
5.44 In this context another option the Committee believes could be
considered is to reduce the height of development within 3 metres
of the block
boundary to a maximum of one storey so that the tree canopy has room to grow
above the roofline.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that the
Directorate adjust Rule 14 and Figure 3 in the proposed Curtin Precinct Code to
leave space for
full-sized street trees on Strangways Street in front of both
residential and commercial development, while also creating functional
commercial space that is able to attract customers.
6. Conclusion
6.1 The Committee makes seven recommendations.
6.2 The Committee thanks the organisations and individuals who made
submissions to this inquiry.
