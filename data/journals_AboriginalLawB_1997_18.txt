Book Review The Aboriginal Tasmanians (2nd Edition)
Book Review
The Aboriginal
(2nd Edition)
by Lyndall Ryan
Sydney Allen & Unwin. 1996, xxxii & 380pp
Reviewed by Clive Moore
The first edition of
The Aboriginal Tasmanians
was published by
University of Queensland Press in 1981. The book has no equal and deserved
reprinting, but as with many second editions
the reviewer is left with the task
of working out what has changed. The first chapter of Ryan's book examines the
pre-European-incursion
lifestyle of Tasmania's Aborigines, now known as the
Pallawah. The book then follows their fate after European colonisation through
eighteen more chapters, with the second edition text now extended through to the
1990s. The nineteen chapters trace the gradual decimation
of Pallawah numbers,
but quite strongly stress the survival of Indigenous Tasmanians. Indirectly,
this is a suitable counter to Tom
Haydon's Rhys Jones-influenced film
Last Tasmanians
, released in 1978, which created a picture of a declining
race not fit to face the European onslaught.
The original book was written at a time when there was very little decent
literature available on the history of Aboriginal-White
relations in Australia.
Henry Reynolds' first book,
The Other Side of the Frontier
, was published
the same year. The only substantial studies available for inspiration were
Charles Rowley's 1970 trilogy
Aboriginal Policy and Practice
The Destruction of Aboriginal Society
Outcasts in White Australia
), and Raymond Evans'
early work on Queensland (Evans, K Saunders and K Cronin,
Race Relations in
Colonial Queensland
, 1975/1988). Given this context, Ryan's book is
remarkably well researched and perceptive. It also has one important strength,
wonderful set of forty-five maps. Seldom has a history book been so well
served by cartography. Even without the text one can follow
the seasonal
movements of the Pallawah, graphically seeing the effect of European pastoralism
on their movements, and look region
by region at the results of
colonisation.
The new Acknowledgments pages left me with the impression of a totally
reworked text, but a closer check shows that apart from perhaps
corrections, the original body of the text has been left unaltered. The real
changes are additions: a new fourteen page Introduction,
which discusses recent
archaeological finds and places the 1981 edition into a wider historiographic
context; a new twenty-seven
page chapter on the politics of Tasmanian Aboriginal
identity, 1973 to 1992; and a final twenty-three page chapter on
reconciliation and the new Aboriginal politics of the 1990s. The upshot
of 1990s politicking was the 1995 decision by the Tasmanian
government to
transfer 3,800 hectares of land back to the Pallawah, including mutton bird
islands in Bass Strait and historic sites
on Tasmania, although there was to be
no official apology for the massacres and forced detentions of last century.
The most interesting legal points arising from the book are the contrasts
between Henry Reynolds' arguments presented in
The Law of the Land
Fate of a Free People
Aboriginal Sovereignty
(1996), which have placed considerable stress on the colonial legal precedents
of the 1830s and 1840s. For Tasmania, Reynolds argues
that a verbal treaty was
made between the Pallawah and the colonial government to induce surrender, which
was dishonoured (1995:
pp 122-3, 156-7). Ryan does not believe that there ever
was anything that can be construed as a formal treaty (1996: p xxviii).
The second edition is sixty-five pages longer, the number of illustrations
has been increased, and some of the originals have been
replaced with better
quality reproductions. The new edition is worthwhile for one photo alone: a 1977
shot of a very concerned Queen
Elizabeth, wearing a tiara, being presented with
a lands rights petition by a casually dressed Michael Mansell.
