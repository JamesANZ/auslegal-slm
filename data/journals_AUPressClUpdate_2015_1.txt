MEDIA RELEASE | 19 February 2015
Council resolution about conduct of The
The Australian Press Council has expressed its deep concern at recent conduct
of The Australian, which has again deliberately breached
its obligations to the
The Council has also denied assertions made by The Australian about the scope
of the Council’s authority, about recent adjudications
by the Council, and
At its meeting this week, the Council passed the following resolution (by 18
votes to 1):
“The Council
deep concern that, notwithstanding assurances at its last
Council meeting that News Corp publications were complying with the obligations
of Council membership, The Australian has again chosen consciously to breach one
of the Council’s firmest requirements concerning
the confidentiality of
its provisional adjudications;
that until The Australian provides assurance that it will abide
by Council’s requirements, complainants against the publication
advised that confidentiality cannot be assured, but that the Council will still
consider the complaint if the complainant
so desires;
the Executive Director to make a public statement explaining
the Council’s concern and asks the Chair to write to the Editor
Australian calling on him to abide by the obligations of a member of the
the assertion by The Australian that the Council has exceeded
its authority and notes with concern The Australian’s further
misrepresentations of the role and policies of the Council and views of its
Chair since his Press Club speech.”
The Executive Director, John Pender, said:
“The Australian’s assertions about the legal and traditional
scope of the Council’s work are incorrect. It has also
misrepresented the
particular adjudication to which it referred, the provisional adjudication in
relation to which it breached confidentiality,
and the Council’s general
approach to photographs which depict the horrors of accidents, war or other
disasters.”
“The requirement of confidentiality of provisional adjudications is
designed to enable complainants and publications to have
an opportunity to
comment and seek changes before an adjudication is finalised. This opportunity
will continue to be generally available
but will need to be re-considered where
a publication repeatedly breaches the terms on which it is provided.”
The adjudications
The following extract from the final adjudication to which The Australian
objected contains the Council’s full reasons for not
upholding the
“The Council considers that the image was likely to cause substantial
offence and distress to a significant number of people.
This impact was due
largely to the close proximity of the knife to Mr Foley’s neck and thus to
what readers might have perceived
as the actual beheading.
On the other hand, the Council agrees that it is sometimes in the public
interest for people to be exposed in a powerful way to realities
which they may
find upsetting but about which it is important that public opinion is
well-informed. This applies especially to behaviour
that, as in this case, is of
an extreme kind with which they may not already be familiar and which has
potentially far-reaching consequences.
The Council considers that the image could well have been published on an
inner page without losing its effectiveness. This would
have reduced the risk of
offence or undue harm to children and others including those who merely saw it
in passing. The risk could
also have been reduced by choosing, as did many other
publications, an image less close to the actual beheading but still powerfully
On balance, however, the Council has concluded that publication of the image
was not a breach of its Standards. This is mainly because
there was a very
strong justification in the public interest due to the extreme behaviour about
which it was reasonable to believe
readers should be well-informed.
The Council welcomes the careful consideration in the publication of images
of this nature, but emphasises that where the justification
is less powerful
than in this case, some images may breach its Standards of Practice if published
on the front page even though they
would not have done so if published less
prominently. The particular placement of material is not usually a matter for
consideration
by the Council but in some cases it may affect whether the
Standards have been breached because, for example, it substantially affects
circumstances in which the material is seen, the range of people who see it, or
the nature of its impact on them
Accordingly, the Council has concluded that its Standards of Practice were
not breached.”
The wording of the provisional adjudication to which The Australian objected
cannot be disclosed until the adjudication has been finalised.
