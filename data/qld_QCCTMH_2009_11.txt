REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Hainke (“the applicant”) seeks an order that she was an applicant in
application MH006-08 and that the orders made
by Member Spender on 17 December
2008 apply equally to her. She says her name was on the list of applicants
attached to the application
filed on the 23 June 2008. To the contrary, Haraba
Pty Ltd as trustee for the Haraba Trust t/a Gateway Village Resort (“the
respondent”) says that the applicant was not on the new list of applicants
and the orders made on 17 December 2008 were not
referrable to her.
application is being determined on the papers.
applicant is the owner of a manufactured home positioned at the Gateway Village
Resort, 200 School Road Rochedale in the State
of Queensland. The respondent is
the park owner.
23 June 2008 fifty-five homeowners lodged application MH006-08 seeking to
challenge a proposed site rent increase on the ground
that it was excessive.
The applicants were described as “
Robert Joseph Cramp and Gladys Kay
Cramp and others see attachment 1
”. Attachment 1 listed the names of
fifty-five homeowners with signatures and began with the preamble:
We the resident home owners of Gateway Village listed
below, wish to confirm that it is our wish to be represented in any action to
taken against Gateway Village Resort in the CCT by the delegation of four
residents namely: Bob Cramp, Neville Beecroft, Jarred
McCrenor and Don
applicant’s name and signature was on this list.
6 August 2008 a directions hearing was heard before the Chairperson, Ms J
Schafer. During the hearing Chairperson Schafer impressed
on Mr Cramp, the
representative for the applicants, the need for a new list containing the names
of the applicants, their site numbers
and signatures. Of the many directions
given, two are significant, and are:
“1. By consent, J & G Jones of site 69 and G
Worthington of site 83 are included as applicants in the proceedings.
will file in the registry
deliver to the respondent
of an updated list of applicants on
which the name, signature, and site number of each home owner is listed,
4:00PM ON 28 AUGUST 2008
28 August 2008 a new list was prepared and filed. It contained two pages of
names with their signatures, dates of signing and site
The applicant’s name, signature and site number was not included on this
matter came before Member Spender on 8 and 9 December 2008 for the final hearing
and at the beginning of the hearing discussions
and submissions about the
identity of the persons on the list took place.
In the reasons for decision delivered on 17 December 2008, Member Spender noted
applicants as at the date of the hearing were those
addition of the homeowners on site 69 and 83 who were included in the
application by order of the Tribunal on 6 August 2008
on the 17 December 2008 Member Spender made an order and the applicants on this
order were described as:
“Robert & Gladys Cramp and Neville &
Janice Beecroft and those listed in attachment A of the application filed on 23
June 2008 together with those included on 6 August 2008”
learned Member made an order setting aside the proposed rental increase,
substituting a new rent and ordered a refund of overpayments.
On 20 January 2009 the applicant wrote to the respondent asking why the ordered
refund was not paid to her. The respondents replied:
The applicants who were party to the proceedings were
those listed in the updated applicants list filed pursuant to the directions
6 August 2008, in which you are not included
Since you were not a party to the proceeding you are therefore not
entitled to the Tribunals order of 17 December 2008
applicant now seeks an order that she was an applicant in proceedings MH006-08
as she had signed the attachment to the application.
Applicant’s submissions
applicant said that on 20 June 2008 she approached Mr Cramp a fellow resident
and requested that she be joined in application
MH006-08. She was requested to
sign the document attached to the application and against her name which she
the following months she was away from home for extended periods of time and she
knew nothing of any second list. On 20 January
2009 she became aware that other
residents had received site rent refunds and adjustments in accordance with the
order of the Commercial
and Consumer Tribunal dated 17 December 2008. She
approached the park managers and they informed her she was not an applicant and
was not entitled to the refund.
applicant maintains that she is within the ambit of the order as the applicants
are described in the order as the persons on the
list attached to the
application and the reasons for decision describe the applicants as
those listed in Attachment A of the application filed on 23 June 2008
together with those included on 6 August 2008
”. She said that the
order and the reasons for the decision makes no reference whatsoever to any
second list.
said she was away and not available to sign the second list.
Mr Cramp, the person representing the applicants at the hearing, swears that the
applicant attended his home on 20 June 2008, requested
to be included in the
application and signed the list in his presence. He said that he was not
involved in gathering the second
set of signatures but he said the applicant was
not contactable when the signatures were collected. It was not until 20 January
2009 that the applicant contacted him and enquired as to why she was not
receiving her refund adjustment for site rent.
Mr Beecroft said that he visited all the residents listed in the original
application to obtain their signatures for the updated
list. In the course of
this action he was unable to obtain the signature of two residents, Heather
Forman and Jean Hainke as they
were away from the village for an extended period
and were not contactable.
Respondent’s submissions
respondent submitted that the applicant is not entitled to the benefit of the
order made on 17 December as she was not included
in the updated list of
applicants. In a letter dated 27 January 2009 the respondent stated:
We reject any suggestion that we have acted in
contravention of the Commercial and Consumer Tribunals order of 17 December
The list of applicants who were party to the proceedings are those listed
in the updated applicants list filed pursuant to the directions
of 6 August
2008 in which you are not included. It is not our obligation to make sure that
the applicants list were named in it. That
was the responsibility of the applicant’s representative, Mr Robert Cramp.
time during the course of the proceedings or prior to the decision did Mr
Cramp or any other person raise that you ought to be part
proceedings.
Since you were not a party to the proceedings you are therefore not
subject to the Tribunals order of 17 December 2008
Observations and Findings
dispute will be resolved by a consideration of the orders made by Member Spender
on the 17 December 2008 and the reasons for
decision delivered on that same
The confusion arose because the applicant signed the original application and
was not available when the second list was being prepared.
If she was available
she would no doubt have signed it.
the reasons for decision delivered on 17 December 2008 Member Spender noted that
the applicants as at the date of the hearing
“were those homeowners
whose name appeared on a list attached to the application, with the addition of
the homeowners on site
69 and 83 who were included in the application by order
of the Tribunal on 6 August 2008
the 17 December 2008 Member Spender made an order and the applicants on this
order were described as:
“Robert & Gladys Cramp and Neville &
Janice Beecroft and those listed in attachment A of the application filed on 23
June 2008 together with those included on 6 August 2008”
As the order made by Member Spender and the reasons for decisions referred to
the applicants who signed the attachment filed with
the application on the 23
June 2008 and as the applicant’s name was on this list, I am satisfied
that the applicant was an
applicant in proceedings MH006-08. On the other hand,
if Member Spender had stated that the applicants were those persons listed
the new list the position may have been different.
In these circumstances I am satisfied that the applicant was an applicant in
MH006-08 and is entitled to the benefit of the orders
Tribunal order is as follows:
applicant was an applicant in MH006-08 and is entitled to the benefit of the
orders made.
