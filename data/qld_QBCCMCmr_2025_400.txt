Mixed Use Development

ORDERS MADE:
The application is dismissed.
REASONS FOR DECISION
Hanson seeks three orders against his body corporate:
Recognition
of CBC Levies as Liabilities
That the Body Corporate be directed to record and treat all levies issued to
Duhig by the Community Body Corporate...as valid and
payable liabilities,
including special levies raised by the CBC EGM held 4 October 2022, the CBC AGM
held on 20 December 2023, and
the CBC EGM held on 25 March 2025.
Reimbursement of $300 Invoice
That the Body Corporate be directed to reimburse Daniel Hanson (Lot 21) the
$300 charge issued for the replacement of a door handle,
on the basis that the
charge was unreasonable and/or issued in a hostile or punitive context.
Removal and Exclusion from Committee Positions
That Franklin Manoharan and Joe Joseph be removed from holding any committee
positions in Duhig...for a period of three years.
Recognition of CBC Levies
is a member of Cathedral Place Community Body Corporate (
obliged to pay it contributions under the
Mixed Use Development Act 1993
apparently been collecting contributions from its proprietors to pay the
CBC’s levies, but has not paid them because
it disputes their
“validity and enforceability...due to persistent financial mismanagement,
unauthorized expenditure, lack
of transparency, and procedural
irregularities.”
[3] Mr Hanson
wants Duhig to pay the CBC’s outstanding levies and record them as
liabilities in its financial statements. With
respect to the second issue, the
Act does not prescribe the minutiae of the body corporate’s accounting
records. In fact,
the Act does not contemplate a body corporate being a member
of and paying contributions to another body corporate, so unsurprisingly
makes no arrangements for how the body corporate ought to record contributions
levied by the CBC. The body corporate is required
to keep “a receipt
book, cash book, financial institution deposit book, contributions levy
register, cheque book and register
of assets” and “a proper
statement of accounts”,
none of that clearly indicates how contributions owed to a principal body
corporate ought to appear in Duhig’s financial
[4] Mr Hanson
does not have standing to pursue the first issue. As mentioned, Duhig’s
obligation to pay contributions to the
CBC arises under the MUD Act. The
contributions are determined by the CBC and levied on its members, including
If they are not paid, the
CBC may recover them as a debt in a court of competent
There is no direct
role for the proprietor of a lot within a member of the CBC in that
[5] While the
proprietors of Duhig pay contributions levied by Duhig that partially go toward
the CBC’s levies, just as all
of Duhig’s liabilities must ultimately
be met by its members, Mr Hanson does not challenge Duhig’s levying of its
proprietors.
He insists that the money, now collected, must be paid to the CBC
notwithstanding Duhig’s misgivings about the CBC’s
entitlement to
[6] That is
properly a dispute between Duhig and the CBC. It is a dispute about the rights
and obligations of persons under the MUD
Act that the CBC or Duhig could raise
with a referee under section 214A of that Act. But they have not done so. The
CBC is apparently
not pressing a claim to the contributions withheld by Duhig.
It has not made an application to that effect and did not make a submission
response to the present application. I would not make orders purporting to
resolve that dispute without the involvement of the
party most affected by

is nothing explicit in the MUD Act to restrict the parties who might apply under
Australian courts, notably the High Court in its judgment in
the Australian Conservation Foundation case, have closed the door to
principle of open standing. The effect of the locus standi rule is to exclude
some people from obtaining relief from the courts
in declaring and enforcing the
law in circumstances where others could obtain that relief. Neither Australian
nor any other country
of which I have knowledge has a completely open system in
civil law in the sense that anyone can obtain a ruling from a court on
subject upon which the person desires a
[8] If the CBC
wishes to pursue payment of the outstanding contributions it should make an
application to that effect. That would
allow the dispute to be decided between
its protagonists.
Reimbursement of $300
Hanson says he installed a smart lock on his front door with the permission of
the former chairperson of the body corporate
committee. It was subsequently
found not to be compliant with fire safety requirements, so Mr Hanson purchased
a fire-rated replacement
and asked the building caretaker:
mind contacting the repairer to confirm they are happy to install this lock and
pass the inspection?
installation, Mr Hanson was sent an invoice by Duhig’s body corporate
manager for $300 for “replacement of
lockset”. He says he paid it
“in good faith to avoid escalation”. He now wants it reimbursed,
arguing there was
no body corporate resolution to recover the money from him,
the body corporate is responsible for the maintenance of the door and
usually recover the cost directly from other owners, and he may be being
punished for his history of raising governance
and compliance concerns.
[11] The $300
consisted of:
to fill a hole in the door frame
to install a doorstop, and
to install the new smart lock.
committee resolved to reimburse the first two amounts at a committee meeting on
14 August 2025. Only the $205 to install
the fire-rated smart lock remains in
dispute. At the same meeting, the committee voted down Mr Hanson’s motion
proposing reimbursement
of half the $205.
committee did not contest Mr Hanson’s claim that no resolution was passed
to issue an invoice for the $300. Nevertheless,
Mr Hanson chose to pay it and
must now establish why the body corporate is obliged to return it.

corporate must “properly maintain and keep in a state of good and
serviceable repair...each door...in walls where
a side of the door...is part of
the common property”.
covers Mr Hanson’s front door, which is in a wall separating lot 21 from
the common property. As the boundary lies at
the centre of the wall, the
outside face of the door would usually be part of the common

proprietor who makes an improvement to the common property, such as by replacing
a regular door handle with a smart
lock, typically does so at their own expense
and assumes the body corporate’s maintenance responsibilities with respect

thereafter.
[16] Mr Hanson
suggests the body corporate may be punishing him, contrary to the
committee’s obligation to act reasonably when
But there is no
evidence that the committee refused reimbursement in reprisal for unrelated
issues, nor that the body corporate
has absorbed similar costs for other owners.
As noted, it is unremarkable for a proprietor to pay for their own improvement
common property.
[17] Owners
require approval by resolution without dissent to make improvements to the
common property.
Mr Hanson had
at most the oral approval of a former committee chairperson. If the body
corporate wished to punish Mr Hanson, it
could have insisted that he reinstate
his former lock unless he obtains approval by resolution without dissent for the
lock to remain. Instead, it only required him to meet the costs
associated with his new lock.
[18] I am not
satisfied that the body corporate is under any obligation to absorb any costs
associated with Mr Hanson’s new
fire-rated smart lock.
Removal & exclusion of two committee members
Hanson argues that Messrs Joseph and Manoharan, who occupy the committee’s
executive positions, should be removed from
the committee and prohibited from
serving on it for three years. He describes various aspects of their
performance that he considers
unsatisfactory.
[20] But the Act
defines who is electable to the committee and the circumstances in which their
position becomes vacant.
is no lawful basis for removing and excluding committee members for the reasons
argued by Mr Hanson. If proprietors feel
any members have not performed
appropriately, they will take that into account when voting in future committee
