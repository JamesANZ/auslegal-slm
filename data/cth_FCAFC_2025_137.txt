REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
A. SYNOPSIS
Tower Pty Ltd (in liq) was wound up on 28 August 2019 and Mr Neil Robert
was appointed as one of the joint and several liquidators. The
other appointee has since retired. The relation back day is 22 July
Cussen has reason to believe that there are grounds to pursue voidable
transaction claims involving Monarch pursuant to
Division 2 of
Corporations Act
(Cth). In these reasons each
reference to a statutory provision is to the
Corporations Act
unless otherwise
specified. To that end, he applied on 21 July 2022 for an order pursuant to
concerning 10 individuals and corporations as putative
defendants to voidable transaction claims. That was proceeding VID 410/2022.
It will be noticed that the application was made one day prior to expiry of the
three year limitation period at
for the making of an application
s 588FF(1).
Nonetheless, he obtained the extension order on 9 March

proceedings to 22 January 2024. We refer to this as the
extension order

which sometimes refers to unidentified transactions

or some combination of each.

respectively
and collectively as the
2024 proceedings
Cussen did not move with alacrity to serve the 2024 proceedings.
Federal Court (
Corporations
(Cth) provides
that “as soon as practicable after filing an originating process and, in
any case, at least 5 days before the
date fixed for hearing, the plaintiff must
serve a copy of the originating process and any supporting affidavit” on
the respondents. The first date for the hearing of the 2024 proceedings
was subsequently fixed for 2 February 2024. The proceedings
were not served in
time. Informal notification was given by email to some of the respondents, or
their solicitors, which notified
the first date for case management and
foreshadowed an intention to apply for an extension of the time to serve the
2024 proceedings.
2 February 2024, counsel for Monarch and Mr Cussen informed the Corporations
List Duty Judge that, subject to any contrary direction
of the Court, Mr Cussen
intended to proceed with the public examination of certain individuals prior to
prosecuting the 2024 proceedings.
The matter was adjourned to 16 February 2024.
In the meantime, there was correspondence between the solicitors for Monarch and
Cussen and solicitors representing some of the respondents concerning the
failure to serve the proceedings within time. Those respondents
did not waive
the irregularity and foreshadowed applications to permanently stay the
respective proceedings. On 16 February 2024,
some of the respondents were
represented by counsel before a different Corporations List Duty Judge and
foreshadowed an application
for a permanent stay of the proceedings because
service had not been effected as required by the Corporations Rules. The 2024
proceedings
were then docketed to the primary judge.
16 February and 7 March 2024, solicitors acting for Monarch and Mr Cussen
purported to serve the 2024 proceedings. That was
met with applications by the
named respondents for a permanent stay, amongst other orders. Monarch and Mr
Cussen responded with
multiple applications filed on 12 March 2024 for orders
extending the time for service pursuant to r 1.10 of the Corporations Rules
and/or r 1.39 of the
competing applications were heard by the primary judge on 3 and 5 June 2024.
For reasons published on 4 July 2024, his Honour
dismissed each application to
extend time and ordered that each proceeding be summarily dismissed:
in the matter of Monarch Tower Pty Ltd (in liq) v Sinoace Holdings Ltd
[2024] FCA 716
). Subsequently, his Honour published reasons for
making costs orders on 13 November 2024:
Cussen, in the matter of Monarch
Tower Pty Ltd v Sinoace Holdings Ltd (No 2)
[2024] FCA 1309.
1 August 2024, Mr Cussen and Monarch filed six notices of appeal against the
orders made on 4 July 2024. Five were not accepted
for filing until 2 August
2024, but that is a matter of no present consequence. Between 5 August 2024 and
9 July 2025, Mr Cussen
and Monarch filed six amended notices of appeal against
the orders. The notices of appeal in order are: VID 748/2024 (Sinoace BVI
proceeding), VID 749/2024 (Zuccubarr proceeding), VID 751/2024 (Payton
proceeding), VID 752/2024 (Timswee proceeding) and VID 753/2024
(Rill Trading
proceeding). There is a further notice of appeal concerning Sinoace BVI. It is
proceeding VID 754/2024 and concerns
separate orders that the primary judge also
made on 4 July 2024 relating to the extension application. It was accepted
primary judge that Sinoace BVI was not served with and did not
otherwise have notice of the extension application. As we explain,
that led the
primary judge to set aside the extension order to the extent that it affected
the rights of Sinoace BVI.
Separately,
between 28 August 2024 and 30 May 2025, Mr Cussen and Monarch filed six
applications for extensions of time and for leave
to appeal the orders of 4 July
2024. Those applications were brought because of uncertainty in the mind of Mr
Cussen about whether
the orders made by the primary judge were interlocutory or
final and whether the primary judge had made summary judgment orders within
Federal Court of Australia Act 1976
). If interlocutory, leave to appeal is required pursuant to
s 24(1A) of the FCA Act; and summary judgment pursuant to s 31A is taken
be interlocutory: s 24(1D)(b) FCA Act.
are additional layers of complexity. The appeal grounds seek to raise arguments
that were not put to the primary judge and
during the hearing of the appeal,
counsel for Mr Cussen and Monarch raised further additional arguments that are
not mentioned in
the grounds of appeal.
this Court must resolve the following issues:
(a) Is leave to appeal required, and if so should it be granted?;
(b) Is an extension of time required, and if so should it be granted?;
(c) Should leave be granted to argue matters not put to the primary judge?;
(d) If (a) and (b) or (c) are resolved in favour of Mr Cussen and Monarch, did
the primary judge err in the exercise of his discretion
as contended in the
appeal grounds?
the reasons that follow, we have concluded that leave to appeal is required and
with it, in each case, an extension of time is
required. Leave is required to
advance arguments that were not put to the primary judge, which leave is
refused. Save for one appeal,
there is no merit in any of the appeal grounds
concerning the dismissal of the applications to extend time for the service of
2024 proceedings and the consequential entry of summary judgment in each
appeal succeeds against the orders made by the primary judge concerning the
Sinoace BVI proceeding (appeal VID 754/2024) where
his Honour set aside the
extension order as against it, determined that he had no power to re-hear the
extension application and
dismissed the proceeding.
the balance of these reasons, it is convenient to collectively reference Mr
Cussen and Monarch as the
applicants/appellants
as the context
B. SOME BACKGROUND
adopt the pellucid summary of the primary judge at PJ [16] – [29] (where
‘the company’ is a reference to Monarch):
The company and the winding up order
The company was incorporated on 1 July 2015, and at all relevant times had three
directors — Anthony Gilbert, Jian Lin and
Li Shao. It operated a property
development business. Its only project involved the acquisition in May 2016 of
land at 256–266
City Road, Southbank, Victoria. The company intended to
construct a residential building on the land. It obtained funding from various
parties in connection with the development of the land in the sum of
approximately $34.9 million. The company ceased trading in January
land was subsequently sold in June 2018 for $38 million.
On 22 July 2019, Mr Chen Hu, a shareholder of the company, filed a winding up
application against the company in the Supreme Court
of Victoria, which on 28
August 2019 ordered that the company be wound up and appointed the liquidator
for the purposes of the winding
The liquidator says that the current claims of creditors against the company
total just over $41 million. In his view, the company
exhibited signs of
insolvency from as early as 30 June 2016, and it was insolvent from at least 3
August 2017.
Liquidator’s investigations
Upon the liquidator’s appointment, he issued
letters to the company’s directors requiring the delivery up of all books
and records of the company in their possession or control. The liquidator
received a response from Mr Shao (in September 2019). Mr
Lin and Mr Gilbert did
not respond.
In the first three months of his appointment, the liquidator sought to obtain
books and records of the company from a number of third
parties, including from
financial institutions, VicRoads, the Australian Taxation Office, the
company’s former accountants
and lawyers, and from searches of the
Personal Property Securities Register and the Land Titles Office database.
The liquidator formed the view that the books and records obtained were
insufficient for him to understand the particulars and purpose
transactions undertaken by the company.
In May 2020, he obtained approximately 900 gigabytes of documents from the
company’s former IT services provider, ComputerTalk.
Given the volume of the material received, the liquidator determined that it
would not be commercial to embark on the process of
reviewing the documents
without receiving external funding.
From May 2020 to November 2020, he entered into negotiations with a funder to
obtain funding to review the documents provided by
ComputerTalk.
On 26 November 2020, the company, the liquidator and the funder entered into a
funding agreement to enable him to be funded to conduct
the review.
The liquidator and his staff commenced reviewing the documents. In his affidavit
dated 24 April 2024, the liquidator deposed that
while the documents obtained
from ComputerTalk assisted his understanding of the transactions undertaken by
the company, and the
potential legal claims for recovery for the benefit of its
creditors, he still did not have sufficient material to correctly and
explain the nature and purpose of the transactions.
By June 2021 – three years ago – the liquidator had identified
potential claims totalling more than $27 million against
various persons, which
he listed in his evidence as follows:
Persons / Entity
Rill Trading Resources Inc
Sinoace Holdings Limited
Zuccubarr Pty Ltd (ACN 006 062 719) / Zeninvest Pty Ltd

Between July 2021 and May 2022, the liquidator discussed with the funder the
possibility of further funding to commence public examinations
and proceedings
against the company’s directors and potential respondents.
On 16 May 2022, a second funding agreement was entered into to provide such
October and December 2023, the appellants’ solicitors and counsel prepared
initiating documents for the commencement
of the public examinations. The
originating process was filed on 6 December 2023, and summonses and orders for
production were issued
to various persons and entities. The public examinations
were listed by the Court to be held over five days from 24 to 28 June 2024.
C. THE PRIMARY JUDGE’S REASONS IN SUMMARY
primary judge first determined whether the 2024 proceedings validly named
persons and corporations as respondents who were not
listed in the extension
order. He concluded they were not because on a plain construction of the
extension order it is confined
to the persons named therein: PJ [81] –
[106]. That finding is not challenged.
the primary judge addressed an argument of Sinoace BVI that it was denied
procedural fairness because it was not served with
or given informal notice of
the extension application and the affidavit in support, despite the primary
judge being informed during
the hearing that each putative defendant had
received notice. His Honour had considered, as a matter relevant to his
to extend time, that none of the putative respondents raised any
issue of prejudice in the event that time be extended: PJ [19].
Honour had no difficulty in concluding that the denial of procedural fairness
entitled Sinoace BVI to relief that the extension
order be set aside as against
it: PJ [107] – [117]. That order is not challenged, but it founds a
unique ground in the separate
Sinoace BVI proceeding appeal from matter VID
410/2022. The contention is that having set aside the extension order against
BVI, the primary judge erred in holding that he had no power to re-hear
the application concerning it because the application was
spent: PJ [13], [118]
– [148]. In any event, even if that were not so, the primary judge
reasoned that he would not allow
nunc pro tunc
application with
respect to Sinoace BVI: PJ [149].
PJ [151] – [154], the primary judge dispensed with the service application
in so far as it concerned Sinoace Holdings Hong
Kong on the simple ground that
it was not incorporated until after the facts asserted to give rise to the
voidable transaction.
That finding is not challenged by the appellants.
PJ [155] – [156], the primary judge dispensed with two miscellaneous
contentions: that the extension order should be set
aside against all parties
because it is not severable and that the entirety of the claims of the
appellants should be dismissed because
they are hopeless. These findings are
not challenged by any notice of contention.
PJ [158], the primary judge commenced his consideration of the applications to
extend time to effect service of each voidable
transaction proceeding
. His Honour determined that the last day for service was 28
January 2024, being at least five days before the return date fixed
first mention of the applications. His Honour noted that Mr Cussen accepted
that he had failed to serve each proceeding
in time and therefore had breached
both r 2.7 of the Corporations Rules and r 8.06 of the Court Rules: PJ
primary judge then turned to the usual considerations that enliven the
discretion to extend time pursuant to r 1.39 of the Court
Rules, whereby
the Court may extend or shorten any time fixed before or after the time has
expired. This general power is applicable:
r 1.10 Corporations Rules. The
primary judge identified as relevant considerations in the matters before him
the period of delay
and whether there was a satisfactory explanation for it: PJ
[163] – [164]. His Honour also listed a summary of relevant principles
from the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in
Retirement Guide Management Pty Ltd
[2017] VSCA 47
(2017) 54 VR 325
[165]. Of particular relevance to the matters before him, the primary judge
focused on these propositions from
(which at [55] set out and
adopted the summary of Judd J as the primary judge in that case), which dealt
with the equivalent extension
of time rule in proceedings in the Supreme Court
of Victoria:
(9) An extension under r 5.12 would not usually be granted to enable a plaintiff
to further investigate the merits of the claims
or obtain litigation
(10) It is the duty of a plaintiff to serve legal process promptly. The
obligation is more acute in the case of a proceeding commenced
under s 588FF,
arising directly under r 2.7 in relation to an Originating Process, and more
generally under s 25 of the
Civil Procedure Act
(11) Even in the absence of a requirement under the rules to serve as soon as
practicable, an applicant for an extension under r
5.12 would be required to
demonstrate reasonable steps had been taken to serve the court process.
(12) A decision not to serve, made by a plaintiff for forensic or strategic
purposes, is antithetical to the duty to serve promptly.
(13) An extension will not ordinarily be granted to facilitate a
plaintiff’s decision not to serve process on a defendant,
whereabouts were known and who might readily be served.
(14) A delay in service of a proceeding commenced under s 588FF, in
contravention of the applicable rules, is particularly serious
if it occurs
after the expiration of the limitation period.
primary judge accepted on the evidence before him the overarching submission of
each of the respondents which he summarised at
In this case, it was submitted on behalf of all respondents who appeared that
the liquidator deliberately and strategically took
it upon himself not to take
any steps to serve the originating process on the respondents; that he knowingly
allowed the time for
service required by r 2.7 of the Corporations Rules and r
8.06 of the [Court Rules] to expire, including because it would be
onerous” on him to delay service until after the completion of
certain public examinations; and that in those circumstances,
having arrogated
to himself a decision to delay service that was not his to make, his application
for nunc pro tunc orders to make
good late service should be refused.
PJ [167], the primary judge set out, and adopted, an extensive extract from the
written submissions of senior counsel for Zuccubarr.
The submission emphasised
that by no later than 31 January 2024, Mr Cussen knew that he was required to
make an application for
an extension of time to effect service but unilaterally
determined not to do so until the conclusion of the public examinations which
anticipated would occur by mid-April 2024. That was a deliberate decision to
withhold prosecution of the proceedings in order
to accommodate his preference.
It was not a course consented to by the respondents. In consequence, he
advertently permitted each
proceeding to become stale for forensic and strategic
purposes eliding only with his interests. In doing so he “arrogated
himself control over when service should occur, with the clear intention to
affect a stay of the proceedings, which he intended
to be until at least 30 June
2024, so that he could first conduct and complete public examinations which he
had failed to diligently
commence during the 18 month extension period he had
previously been granted by the court”.
submission was stridently critical of the decision by Mr Cussen to put aside
service of the proceedings in order to conduct further
investigations into the
merits of each claim. The submission continued that in those circumstances, Mr
Cussen should not be granted
any further indulgence. Delay is more serious
where it occurs after expiry of the initial three year limitation period, which
the present case. There was further delay in the applications to extend time
for service, which is also unexplained.
primary judge summarised his reasons for refusing to extend time at PJ [169] and
[171] respectively:
The liquidator’s conduct in arrogating to himself the role of deciding
when to effect proper service on the respondents, flying
in the face of the
Rules and the applicable principles, is made even worse in light of the
leisurely way he has approached his task
since his appointment, and his
unfortunate practice of making court applications on the final day of limitation
The respondents in these proceedings are all facing claims in which the
liquidator challenges transactions which took place in 2017.
His explanations
for the delay put in support of his nunc pro tunc applications are wholly
inadequate, for the reasons I have detailed
Accordingly,
the primary judge ordered that each application to extend time be refused and
that each proceeding be summarily dismissed;
giving as an additional reason for
the dismissal of proceeding VID 410/2022 that no further relief can be granted
in respect of it:
D. IS LEAVE TO APPEAL REQUIRED?
time limited for the filing of a notice of appeal from a final order is 28 days:
r 36.03 of the Court Rules and s 30AF of the
FCA Act. If the orders
of 4 July 2024 were final, the appeals were brought within time. If the orders
were not final, the time
limited for an application for leave to appeal is 14
days: r 35.13 of the Court Rules. In that event, an extension of time is
for leave to appeal: r 35.14.
applicants contend that leave to appeal is not required, as the orders are
final, but in the alternative submit that leave should
be granted if that point
is determined adversely to them. The respondents variously submit that leave to
appeal and an extension
of time is required in each appeal, which should be
leave and extension of time applications are in the same form. The drafting is
prolix. The contention is that the orders made
by the primary judge are
attended by sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of leave to appeal pursuant to
s 24(1A) of the FCA Act by
reference to the grounds in each notice of
appeal. Further, it is contended that substantial injustice will be caused to
the applicants
in that the proceedings were not commenced for personal benefit;
rather for the benefit of the creditors of Monarch and there are
prospects of success on the merits of the underlying claims. The applications
are supported by multiple affidavits made
by Mr Cussen on 24 and 29 April, 9,
20, 30 and 31 May and 28 August 2024. He was not cross-examined.
to appeal is required for two reasons. First, the primary judge summarily
dismissed each proceeding. Having refused the applications
to extend time for
service, the Court did not have jurisdiction. Service goes to the jurisdiction
of the Court to determine the
proceedings:
Laurie v Carroll
[1958] HCA 4
(1958) 98 CLR 310
at 323-324, Dixon CJ, Williams and Webb JJ. The proceedings
therefore had no reasonable prospect of success and summary dismissal
correct order. An order which summarily dismisses a proceeding is
interlocutory:
Dimitrovski v Boland
[2023] FCAFC 86
Markovic, Downes and Kennett JJ.
reasoning should not be conflated with the validity of each proceeding. Section
51 of the FCA Act provides that no proceeding
commenced in this Court is
“invalidated by a formal defect or an irregularity, unless the Court is of
the opinion that substantial
injustice has been caused by the defect or
irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the
It may be accepted that a failure to serve as required by
r 2.7 of the Corporations Rules is an irregularity that is capable of
by a successful application to extend the time for service. The proceeding is
not a nullity:
MBD Management Pty Ltd v Butcher
[2010] FCA 1071
[91] – [92], Edmonds J;
Re Equititrust Ltd (in liq) (Receivers and
Managers Appointed) (No 1)
[2018] FCA 39
– [43], Foster
that is not to the present point. The reliance by Mr Evans KC for the
applicants on s 51 of the FCA Act as the foundation for
the submission that
it was for the respondents to apply to set aside service which “in
fact” had been effected, although
beyond the time determined by r 2.7
of the Corporations Rules, is misplaced. Service could not be validly effected
after 28 January
2024 in that each proceeding was stale, absent waiver of the
defect. There was no waiver by any defendant. Thus, service could
effected absent an extension of the time limited for service:
[2005] NSWCA 135
(2005) 53 ASCR 442
, Tobias JA (Hodgson
and Ipp JJA agreeing).
second reason is that an application to extend time for the commencement of a
proceeding pursuant to
s 588FF(3)(b)
Corporations Act
does not finally
determine the underlying rights of the parties in the principal cause, with the
consequence that appeals from such
orders are interlocutory:
[2024] FCAFC 102
(2024) 305 FCR 55
– [54], McElwaine, McEvoy and Neskovcin JJ.
the requirement for leave to appeal at s 24(1A) of the FCA Act applies.
The well-understood considerations are engaged:

Ltd v Dart Industries Ltd
[1991] FCA 844
(1991) 33 FCR 397
399, Sheppard, Burchett and Heerey JJ. Accepting there are no rigid rules, it
is usual to consider whether “the
decision is attended with sufficient
doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by the Full Court” and whether

will result if leave is refused.
have the benefit of full argument on the appeal grounds as ultimately pressed.
For the reasons stated in Parts E and G, the grounds
in the discretionary error
appeals were not devoid of merit even though we have rejected each. The ground
in VID 754/2024 raises
a substantial question of whether this Court should
follow a decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal. We also accept in a
sense the evidence of Mr Cussen in his affidavit of 28 August 2024, that
if leave is refused substantial injustice will be suffered
by himself, Monarch
and its creditors caused by the inability to pursue substantial monetary
recovery proceedings. A grant of leave
to appeal is justified in each

usual considerations tend to overlap with whether leave should be granted:
Tu’uta v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and
Multicultural Affairs
[2022] HCA 28
(2022) 276 CLR 579
Gordon, Edelman and Steward JJ. For the same reasons they favour an extension
of time. The additional consideration is the length
of delay and whether there
is an adequate explanation for it coupled with counterbalancing prejudice to the
respondents. Mr Cussen
explains in his 28 August 2024 affidavit the reason for
delay, being uncertainty whether the extension orders of the primary judge
final or interlocutory. It was initially considered that the extension orders
were final and the notices of appeal were filed
in time. The position was
reconsidered when, on 14 August 2024, the respondents took the point in some
notices of objection to competency.
The applications for leave to appeal were
filed shortly thereafter.
distinction between final and interlocutory orders is often a difficult one to
draw. It is a common mistake for even experienced
lawyers to misunderstand it.
There is no real prejudice to the respondents if time is extended. The
administration of justice in
these proceedings justifies an extension. That
order will be made in each proceeding.
F. THE SINOACE BVI APPEAL (VID 754/2024)
address this appeal first, where the point is unique to Sinoace BVI. The
contention is that the primary judge erred in concluding
that once the extension
order directed to Sinoace BVI was set aside, the Court had no power to re-hear
the extension application
because it was spent: PJ [148].
primary judge considered that he was bound to follow the majority reasons of the
Queensland Court of Appeal in
Stramit Corporation
[2003] QCA 298
[2004] 2 Qd R 17
for the proposition that once a court has
determined an application under s 588FF(3)(b) it cannot re-hear the
application if subsequently
the extension order made is set aside in part as
against one or some creditors: Williams and Jerrard JJA. The appellants contend
that this Court should reach the contrary conclusion aligned with the dissenting
reasons of Fryberg J.
588FF relevantly provides:
Courts may make orders about voidable transactions
(1) Where, on the application of
a company's liquidator, a court is satisfied that
a transaction of the company is voidable because
of section 588FE, the court may make one or more of the
following orders:
(a) an order directing a person to
pay to the company an amount equal to some or all of
the money that the company has paid under
the transaction;
(3) An application under subsection (1) may only be made:
(a) during the period beginning on the relation-back day and ending:
(i) 3 years after the relation-back day; or
(ii) 12 months after the first appointment of a liquidator in relation
to the winding up of the company;
whichever is the later; or
(b) within such longer period as the Court orders on an
application under this paragraph made by
the liquidator during the paragraph
(a) period.
should also be made that the general power at s 1322 to, inter alia, extend
time periods does not apply. Section 588FF(3)
covers the field:
Ltd v Brown
[2003] NSWCA 216
(2003) 58 NSWLR 322
, [129], Spigelman CJ, Mason P and Handley JA agreeing;

(2006) 231 CLR 334
, Gleeson CJ, Gummow,
Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ;
Grant Samuel Corporate Finance Pty Ltd v
[2015] HCA 8
(2015) 254 CLR 477
a liquidator’s application for an extension of time pursuant to s 588FF(3)
is “spent” once the extension
is granted, and hence the power cannot
be re-enlivened if the extension order is later set aside in part, is a
difficult question
on which there is division in appellate authority.
considering the authorities, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of
what occurred before the primary judge. Mr Cussen
applied by originating
application dated 21 July 2022, in proceeding VID 410/2022. He sought an order
pursuant to s 588FF(3)(b)
extending the time for the making of an application
under s 588FF(1) to, and including, 22 January 2024 “with respect to any
voidable transaction involving” Monarch and “each or any of”,
amongst others, Sinoace BVI. He obtained that order
on 9 March 2023. The order
did not reserve liberty to apply. Sinoace BVI filed a Notice of Appearance in
the proceeding subsequently
commenced against it on 15 March 2024 (VID 31/2024).
That did not operate as a submission to jurisdiction or a waiver of irregular
service as, concurrently and consistently with rr 10.11 and 13.01(1) and
(3) of the Court Rules, it filed an application for a declaration
originating process had not been duly served, that it be set aside against it
and that the proceeding be permanently stayed
against it.
primary judge determined that because Sinoace BVI as “the target of an
extension application” had not been given the
opportunity to be heard upon
it, it was “entitled to have the order set aside”: PJ [115]. The
reference by the primary
judge for that proposition to
Williams (as
liquidator of Willahra Pty Ltd (in liq)) v Kim Management Pty Ltd

confirms that the primary judge set aside the

of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in

is the third proposition that is central to this appeal. Helpfully the primary
judge summarised the salient facts of
Stramit Corporation
and the result
at PJ [126] – [131]:
In that proceeding, on 7 September 2000 Mullins J had made an order on an ex
parte application extending the time within which the
liquidators might
institute proceedings pursuant to s 588FF(1).
On 16 May 2002, Chesterman J set the order aside in so far as it applied to
Stramit Corporation Pty Ltd (Stramit).
On 5 June 2002, the liquidators applied for an order joining Stramit in the
proceedings and a consequential order extending the time
for bringing
proceedings until 30 June 2002.
On 1 October 2002, Mullins J on the original application filed on 31 August 2000
made an order adding Stramit as a party and extending
the time pursuant to s
588FF(3)(b).
Stramit appealed and sought to have the 1 October order set aside.
By a majority (Williams and Jerrard JJA, Fryberg J dissenting), the Full Court
held that the effect of Chesterman J’s order
was that Stramit was not a
creditor affected by the order made on 7 September 2000, making it necessary for
the liquidators to commence
a fresh proceeding seeking an extension of time
— which, as is the case here, they could not do because the time limit had

identify any putative defendant or category of
claim. It provided
Pursuant to Section 588FF(3) of the Corporations Law, the time within which
applications may be brought under Section 588FF(1) by
the applicants be extended
to end on 11 September 2001.
JA reasoned in part as follows at [71]:
My concern is that the original
order has not been set aside. In
this case the order made by Mullins J on 7 September 2000 still stands as a
final order of the court.
Effectively all the order of Chesterman J has done is
to make it clear that that order does not apply to Stramit because that company
was denied the opportunity of being heard. The order stands with respect to all
other creditors of the company, and is,
prima facie, an
order finally
disposing of the application. Stramit was not identified as a party to the
original application as at 7 September 2000
and, as has been recognised by both
Austin J and Mullins J, it is necessary to somehow have a proceeding against
Stramit before an
order binding upon it can be made. There was an application
made to the court by the document filed 31 August 2000 and there was
order of the court, disposing of all issues raised by that application, made on
7 September 2000. The fact that it was subsequently
held that that order was not
binding on Stramit, who was not a party to that application, does not mean that
the proceeding commenced
by the application has not been fully and finally
determined by the order of 7 September 2000.
Honour returned to that aspect at [78] – [81]. It is not necessary to set
out the passages, save to note that his Honour
maintained his view, despite the
contrary reasoning of Austin J in
DML Resources
[2001] NSWSC 590
(2001) 52 NSWLR 685
that no authority supported “the proposition that the original application
would remain extant so far as the
creditor held to be excluded from the
operation of the order originally made was concerned” and “the
order was not set aside; it still stands so far as
every creditor of the company, other than Stramit, is concerned”:
JA agreed with Williams JA and provided short reasons for doing so. At [117],
his Honour observed “with due respect”
to the contrary view of
Fryberg J, as follows:
The situation when the ex parte order actually made by Mullins J was set aside
on 16 May 2002 “in so far as it applies to Stramit
Corporation Ltd”
was the same, in my judgment, as the position that would have existed had the
order made by Mullins J on 7
September 2000 specifically excluded Stramit. That
position is that subject to appeal, the proceeding on the
application inasmuch as it was an application to which Stramit should have
been a respondent, was concluded by the order of Chesterman
J but adversely to
the liquidators. There was no extant but incomplete proceeding on that
application in which some further step
still remained to be taken, and no
further order was required to dispose of that application, either against
Stramit or as to the
application made in general terms against all possible
respondents.
the contrary, Fryberg J reasoned that that the order made on 7 September 2000
was set aside in part, which he regarded as “a
statement of historical
fact” at [145] and continued:
With effect from 16 May 2002 at the very least, that order no longer affected
Stramit. Probably the order of 16 May 2002 should be
construed as setting aside
the original order ab initio, lest it be argued that it was effective in the
period up to that date; but
that need not be decided at this point. Once the
order was set aside in part, the liquidators no longer had all of the relief for
which they had applied in the original application.
Honour next reasoned that the original application had not been finally disposed
of: [146] – [148]. In part, he observed:
There is no doubt that even after 16 May 2002 so much of the order of 7
September 2000 as remained was a final order of the court.
However that does not
answer the question. Nor is it answered by the fact that the liquidators were no
longer entitled to get all
the relief for which they had applied. Both of these
matters are relevant to the question, but they do not conclude it.
When on an application a court makes a final order granting the applicant less
relief than was sought in the application, the question
whether the application
has been finally disposed of can be resolved only by examining what occurred at
the hearing...
In the present case Chesterman J did not set aside the order as against Stramit
with the intent or for the purpose of ensuring that
the original application
fail against that company; in other words, on the merits. He did so to enable a
hearing to take place.
Accordingly,
Mullins J was correct to conclude that the liquidators’ application had
not been finally disposed of: [149].
concerned a liquidator’s claim that voidable transactions
against a number of creditors should be set aside, including payments
$5.7 million to BP. The liquidators did not commence proceedings within the
three year period. They applied for an extension
of time. There were multiple
applications before Austin J resulting in seven judgments. The application to
extend time was heard
and time was extended. BP succeeded in an
application to set aside the order as affecting it. Many issues were dealt with
Court of Appeal, including the availability of s 1322 on an
application pursuant to s 588FF, which as we have noted the Court held
not available. In reaching that conclusion, Spigelman CJ referenced the
decision of Mullins J in
Greig v Australian Building Industries Pty Ltd (in
[2002] QSC 298
(2002) 171 FLR 41
, where her Honour determined that
s 1322 could not be availed of: [50], [70]. Mullins J was upheld on that
Stramit Corporation
. In what is a postscript to his reasons,
Spigelman CJ noted that the Court of Appeal decision in
Corporation
was delivered after he had drafted his reasons: [195]. Then, in
obiter reasoning, his Honour set out an extensive analysis of the
Appeal decision and reached two conclusions. One, to confirm his earlier
conclusion that a general order may be made against
unspecified creditors: [200]
– [204]. The other at [207] that:
I see considerable force in the dissenting opinion of Fryberg J that the effect
of the subsequent order, which is in identical terms
to that of Austin J in the
present proceedings, had the consequence that the original proceedings were not
finally disposed of. The
differ in that the
original order extending time did not, as the orders made by Austin J did,
reserve liberty to persons to apply
to set aside or vary the order extending
time. However, this express reservation only made clear what would in any event
be the legal
position: a person affected by an ex parte order may always apply
to have the order set aside. (See
Owners of the SS Kalibia v
[1910] HCA 77
(1910) 11 CLR 689
at 694, per Griffith
CJ next drew an important distinction before ultimately observing that it was
not necessary to decide the issue. At [208],
his Honour observed:
Furthermore, the test of finality is the determination of the rights of the
parties in a “principal cause”, not the determination
application before the court. (See
Hall v Nominal
[1966] HCA 36
(1966) 117 CLR 423
at 443, per
Windeyer J. See generally
Southern Cross Exploration NL v Fire and All
Risks Insurance Co Ltd (No 2)
(1990) 21 NSWLR 200.)
There may be
cases where ancillary proceedings are appropriately characterised as the lis
before the court. However, an application
for an extension of time is not, in my
opinion, able to be so characterised. The “principal cause” is the
application
under s 588FF(1).
Court referenced that paragraph with approval in
at [51] to conclude
at [52] – [53] that an order made on a s 588FF(3)(b) application does
not determine the rights of the parties
in the underlying cause and is therefore
interlocutory. To the contrary, the reasoning in
Stramit Corporation
proceeds on the basis that the order is final: [71], [78], [80], Williams JA;
[116], Jerrard JA and [146], Fryberg J. Whether the
order was final or
interlocutory was not argued. That leads to difficulty in accepting the ratio
as correct. An interlocutory order
is just that: it lacks finality for all
purposes. No question of
res judicata,
merger, issue estoppel or Anshun
estoppel arises:

it is correct that the order made by Mullins J in
Stramit Corporation
7 September 2000 bound each creditor until set aside against one, some or all,
it was not with respect to Williams JA “a

disposing of all the issues raised by [the application]” (at [78]). And
similarly with respect to
Jerrard JA, who at [116] reasoned on the same basis.
This is not to overlook that Fryberg J also proceeded on the premise that the
order was final at [146], which his Honour then qualified at [147] in
distinguishing cases where a court “does not decide part
of an application
on the merits”. However, the reasoning does not address that
determination of an application made pursuant
to s 588FF(3) does not
determine the substantive rights of the parties under s 588FF(1).

that a fresh application would now be out of time”: [7].

Austin J was primarily concerned with the
joinder of BP Holdings to the proceeding, ultimately to conclude that joinder
faced insurmountable
difficulties: [81]. However at [29] – [30], Austin J
addressed the status of the extension application consequent upon the
of BP Holdings:
The BP companies have applied for orders setting aside the ex parte orders made
on 4 September 2000, insofar as they are affected
by the ex parte orders. I have
decided that the orders sought by the BP companies should be made. The ground
upon which I shall make
those orders is a procedural ground, namely that the
original orders should not have been made until the BP companies were given
opportunity to be heard. It is not a ground relating to the substance or merits
of the plaintiffs' application for an extension
My decision, therefore, does not mean that the plaintiffs have no substantial
entitlement to the kind of relief that they originally
sought. My reasons for
judgment of 17 July 2001 provided no basis for an order dismissing the
proceeding automatically, and consequently
the proceeding will remain in
existence after the ex parte orders have been set aside. As I have noted, the
prayers for relief in
the originating process need to be amended to make it
clear that the plaintiffs, having already secured an extension of time with
respect to other creditors, now seek an equivalent extension of time only with
respect to the BP companies.

Black was the primary judge in the proceeding that led to the appeal in
Fortress Credit:
Re Octaviar
[2012] NSWSC 1460
(2012) 271 FLR 413.
The liquidators commenced a s 588FF(1) proceeding
against Fortress, which then applied to set aside the founding extension order
to the extent that it applied to it or in the alternative to exclude it from the
application of the order. It contended that it
was an actual or likely target
of an application under s 588FF(1), but was not given notice by the
liquidators of the extension application.
Fortress raised other arguments about
the validity of the extension order, which need not be mentioned.
of the reasoning of Black J is concerned with resolving factual questions about
whether the liquidators were aware, or ought
reasonably to have been aware, that
Fortress was an actual or likely target of a voidable transaction proceeding,
whether Fortress
was entitled to have the extension order set aside
or whether at best the right was to have the court reconsider the
merit of the extension application as against it. Ultimately,
determined to re-exercise the discretion on the extension of time application
because the liquidators conceded that Fortress
was entitled to an opportunity to
make submissions as to whether the order should have been made in the first
place: [62]. In the
preceding paragraph however, Black J rejected the formal
submission of Fortress that the court lacked power to re-hear the extension
application if the extension order was discharged. The competing views in
Stramit Corporation
were identified and Black J considered himself
“bound” by what Spigelman CJ had said in
BP Australia
concerning his preference for the view of Fryberg J: [61]. Black J did not
otherwise elaborate. Of course, his Honour was not bound
by the obiter of
Spigelman CJ.
Harris Scarfe
Ltd (in liq) & Harris Scarfe Wholesale Pty Ltd (in liq)
[2008] SASC 74
(2008) 216 FLR 242
raised a number of issues, of
which one is presently relevant. On 14 April 2004, the liquidators obtained an
order extending the
time for the commencement of s 588FF(1) proceedings
against 19 named creditors plus unidentified creditors. Recovery proceedings
were subsequently instituted against the 19 named creditors and a number of
creditors who were within the unidentified class. Some
of the creditors made
applications to set aside the order of 14 April 2004, because they were not
given notice of the application.
The applications succeeded and Debelle J
ordered that the extension order be set aside as against those creditors and be
and determined
inter partes
: [12]. An issue arose as to whether
the liquidators were required to join the 19 creditors as respondents to the
voidable transaction
proceeding. His Honour determined that joinder was not
necessary, as the liquidators were entitled to have the original extension
application listed for hearing against those creditors: [23].
reasoning to that conclusion at [22], Debelle J stated in part:
Notwithstanding that none of the 19 creditors is a named party to the
application made on 28 March 2004 for an extension of time,
the current
liquidators are, nevertheless, at liberty to have that application for an
extension of time reconsidered against each
of those creditors. The fact that
the extension order was set aside as against certain creditors has no
consequence other than that
the application made on 28 March 2004 must be
considered afresh as against each of those creditors and on the facts that
to the liquidators and to each creditor. The application made on 28
March 2004 was a valid application. The current liquidators are
not making a
fresh application but are seeking a re-hearing of the application made on 28
March 2004. It is being re-heard for the
reason only that the order as against
those 19 creditors has been set aside. The fact that the 19 creditors did not
get notice of
the application until well after the limitation period in s
588FF(3) had expired does not of itself assist the 19 creditors as s
588FF(3)(b) requires only that the application has been instituted before
the expiry of that time limit. The liquidators had intended
that these 19
creditors would be bound by the order made on 14 April 2004. They are not bound
because they had no notice of the application
and they were not given an
opportunity to be heard. The re-hearing will determine whether the liquidators
are to be granted an extension
of time against each of those 19 creditors. It is
as if these 19 creditors had been named in the summons and the application
each is now being heard for the first time. In other words, the
application remains on foot and has to be reconsidered in the light
evidence then adduced. At the hearing of the application each party will be at
liberty to adduce evidence and make submissions.
The liquidators will be at
liberty to show why they should be permitted to institute proceedings after the
expiry of the three year
period and each creditor will be at liberty to contend
why the order should not be made, adducing such evidence of prejudice and
facts on which each creditor relies.
also [29], where his Honour restated his conclusion that the liquidators were
“entitled to a re-hearing of the application
as against these 19
creditors”.
Honour regarded that procedure as consistent with the reasons of Chesterman J
and Fryberg J in
Stramit Corporation
and Spigelman CJ in
of the creditors then appealed to the Full Court:
[2008] SASC 203
(2008) 219 FLR 329.
The appeals were dismissed,
though it should be understood that the issues for determination concerned
first, whether new liquidators
could be substituted for the retired liquidators
(who had obtained the extension order), second, whether the liquidators could
the extension application against the now identified creditors with or
without joining each as a defendant to the application, and
third, whether the
extension order was validly made in relation to unidentified creditors. Doyle
CJ, with whom Anderson and David
JJ agreed, held that the new liquidators could
be substituted, joinder was permissible but unnecessary and the order was
made. As such, the appeal did not directly raise for determination
whether the extension application could be re-heard as against
the creditors who
had succeeded in having the order set aside.
Nonetheless,
Doyle CJ referenced without demur the reasoning of Debelle J on that issue at
[22], [40] and [46] – [48]. In doing
so the Chief Justice also expressed
agreement with what Debelle J had said at [29].
should the conflict in the authorities be resolved? On the weight of numbers
there is clear direct or obiter support for the
view of Fryberg J in
Corporation
. But that hardly resolves the issue at the level of principle.
In our view and with respect to the views of Williams JA and Jerrard
Stramit Corporation,
we do not accept that when an extension order made
under s 588FF(3) is set aside upon application by an affected creditor, who was
not given notice of the extension application, that the application cannot be
redetermined as against that creditor.
starting point is to recognise that an
interlocutory order is by
its very nature defeasible, upon an application
ex debito justitiae
explained by Rich J in
It is a fundamental principle of natural justice, applicable to all courts
whether superior or inferior, that a person against whom
a claim or charge is
made must be given a reasonable opportunity of appearing and presenting his
case. If this principle be not observed,
the person affected is
ex debito justitiae
, to have any determination which
affects him set aside; and a court which finds that it has been led to purport
to determine a matter
in which there has been a failure to observe the principle
has inherent jurisdiction to set its determination aside (
). In such a case there has been no valid trial at all. The setting
aside of the invalid determination lays the ghost of the simulacrum
of a trial,
and leaves the field open for a real trial.

first difficulty with the majority reasoning in
Stramit Corporation
that although Mullins J understood that the extension order was defeasible and
once set aside the application remained to be determined
([70]), Williams JA was
critical of that reasoning at [71] as no authorities were cited in support. The
criticism was repeated at
[78]. In our view there was no need to cite any
authority for the fundamental principle stated by Rich J in
Williams JA expressed his “concern that the original
has not been set aside”: [71]. That is not correct. It was set aside
“in so far as it applies to Stramit Corporation
Ltd” by Chesterman J
on 16 May 2002: [3]. No argument was put that the order was incapable of being
severed or partially set
aside in that way. The reason given by Williams JA at
[71] for his conclusion is also with respect unconvincing:
The fact that it was subsequently held that that order was not binding on
Stramit, who was not a party to the application, does not
mean that the
proceeding commenced by the application has not been fully and finally
determined by the order of 7 September 2000.
misunderstands what occurred. The order was set aside. Chesterman J did not
make some other order that it was not binding on
Corporation Pty
Ltd. Further, the proceeding to which his Honour refers did not result in a
full and final determination when the
extension order was made. As we have
explained, the order was interlocutory and not final.
was also wrong in our respectful view for Williams JA to reason that “the
proceeding”, being the extension application,
was somehow unable to be
determined against Stramit once the order was set aside against it. The
reasoning does not explain why
it is that the application to extend time for the
commencement of a proceeding against all potential creditors was incapable of
re-determination,
this time with one of the corporations within the potential
class of creditors being heard. There is no justification in principle
court then lacked power to re-hear the application.
s 588FF(3)(a) requires is that an application under subsection (1)
“may only be made” within the later of two time
periods unless a
longer period is fixed by a court order made on an application and made within
the period in subparagraph (a).
As explained by Doyle CJ in
[49], the “issue is whether an application was made ... within the
required period” and not when it is ultimately
determined. Where the
extension application is made within the required period but not determined
until after expiry of it, why
is it that, if an extension order is later set
aside, is it not open to re-hear the application? We can discern no reason in
that if a court remains seized of a valid application, it is
nonetheless powerless to determine it. That point was well made by
Harris Scarfe
If a liquidator has been granted a general order pursuant to s
588FF(3)(b) extending the time limit as against creditors of the company
and that order was made on the day before the limitation period has expired, the
order would be entirely futile as against those
creditors who later make
successful applications to set aside the order on the ground of a want of
procedural fairness.
text, context and purpose of the provision does not support the contrary
conclusion of Williams JA. Spigelman CJ in
BP Australia
extensively
essayed the legislative purpose of
Corporations Act
[121]. The overall purpose of requiring expedition to
facilitate certainty in commercial dealings is well understood. What must
be overlooked is that when balancing the competing interests between the
difficulties faced by liquidators in undertaking investigations
into failed
corporations, where it is frequently the case that poor record keeping and
mismanagement is the cause of insolvency,
Parliament only required that an
application under
, or an extension application under
, be made within the later of two defined periods. In doing so,
a general discretion is conferred on the Court to decide in particular
balancing relevant competing interests, whether the conduct of a liquidation and
the transactions in issue justify an extension
of time. The purpose of the
provision is twofold. The requirement to quickly identify voidable transactions
and commence proceedings
is tempered by recognition that it is not always
practicable to do so:
Fortress Credit
at [138] – [139], Gleeson JA.
Those purposes do not require the conclusion that a court is deprived of power
to re-hear an extension
application in the present type of case.
respect to Jerrard JA, his Honour’s reasons do not take the matter any
further. The fact that Mullins J made a general
order for the bringing of any
voidable transaction application does not support the distinction that his
Honour drew at [115] –
[117] between a general order and one that
specifically excludes named creditors. The effect is the same once an unnamed
successfully applies to set aside the order on the basis that it had no
notice and in consequence was not heard on the exercise of
the discretion to
extend time for the commencement of a proceeding against it.
our view, Fryberg J was correct to understand at [145] and [149] that the order
of Mullins J had been set aside in part with the
consequence that the relief
sought by the liquidators against Stramit (as a subsequently identified
creditor) remained to be determined.
reasoning of Fryberg J has the not inconsiderable support, albeit in obiter, of
the New South Wales Court of Appeal in
BP Australia
and of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in
. It is consistent with the view of respected commercial single

conclusion is supported in an analogous context by an argument that the High
Court determined to be without merit in
, which we referenced above
on a different point. The liquidators commenced a
within time in the District Court of New South Wales. Thereafter by operation
of certain rules of the District Court,
the action was taken to be dismissed if,
after six months and 28 days from commencement of the action, no defence had
and default judgment had not been entered. That was the case.
Another rule permitted the District Court to extend time, even when
expired. The issue before the High Court was whether
(Cth) “picked up” these procedural provisions or
whether s 588FF(3) “otherwise provided”. The Court held
procedural rules applied to the proceeding in federal jurisdiction. Once a
proceeding is commenced “the conduct of
the litigation is left to the
operation of the procedures of” the court in which it is commenced:
was sufficient to determine the appeal. However, the Court addressed that which
was described as a remaining subsidiary point
at [43] – [44]. The
appellant had argued that the effect of the default dismissal rule in the
District Court was that thereafter
the exercise of federal jurisdiction was
“spent”. In rejecting the argument at [44] the Court
The circumstance that the Rules provided in the terms of
dismissal of that proceeding does not provide a basis for the conclusion that
the federal jurisdiction was exhausted on 1
December 2003, unless it be assumed
that the "dismissal" was final in all respects. The Rules, as was
emphasised in the course of
argument in this Court, are to be read as a whole.
At all times in the District Court and in the Court of Appeal there was a
in the exercise of federal jurisdiction because those Courts were
seized of a "matter" arising under a law of the Parliament, namely
s 588FF, in
respect of which jurisdiction had been conferred on the District Court
under Pt 9.6A of the same statute.
analogy in the present appeal, once the primary judge set aside the extension
order against Sinoace BVI, there remained to be determined
the extension
application against it. The setting aside did not effect a final determination
of the application.
these reasons, we are convinced that the decision in
Stramit Corporation
is plainly wrong and should not be followed:
Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v
Say-Dee Pty Ltd
[2007] HCA 22
(2007) 230 CLR 89
primary judge erred at PJ [148] when he held that it was not open to re-hear the
extension application. That said, his Honour
is not to be criticised for the
conclusion that he reached in considering that he was bound to follow the
majority holding in
Stramit Corporation.
Departing from a decision of an
intermediate Court of Appeal on the construction of Commonwealth legislation is
ordinarily a matter
for an Appeal Court.
appellants seek an order that order 2 made on 4 July 2024 in proceeding VID
410/2022 be set aside and in its place, the application
be remitted to another
judge for determination. The primary judge also determined the
appellants’ extension application in
proceeding VID 31/2024
concerning Sinoace BVI, stating at PJ [149] that he “would not in any
event allow the liquidator’s
nunc pro tunc
application” with
respect to it. With respect that cannot be so. The primary judge set aside the
extension application and
determined that he could not re-hear it. It follows
that the appellants’ application for an extension of time to serve the
s 588FF(1) proceeding did not arise for determination as there was no
extant proceeding that could be served. Thus, the primary
judge reached the
correct conclusion, but for the wrong reason. The order dismissing that
application will not be disturbed.
appellants have established that the orders made by the primary judge should be
set aside and the extension application must be
remitted to another judge for
determination. That requires a setting aside of order 2 made on 4 July 2024 in
proceeding VID 410/2022,
and each of the orders made on 4 July 2024 and 13

amended the ground provides:
His Honour erred in finding (Reasons at [160]) that service of the originating
process was only able to be effected on or before
28 January 2024. His Honour
should have found that, notwithstanding that service of the originating process
and affidavit in support
had not been effected by the applicants “as soon
as practicable” and in any case in the period between 22 January 2024
28 January 2024 as required by r. 2.7 of the
Federal Court (Corporations)
(Cth), service of the originating process and affidavit in
support on the respondent[s] had, as a matter of fact and law, occurred
relevant dates between 15 February 2024 and 7 March 2024], so that:
proceeding should continue against the respondent[s] unless orders were made on
the application of the respondent setting aside
on the respondents was effected between 15 February 2024 and 7 March 2024. The
dates were 15 February 2024 (Zuccubarr), 19
February 2024 (Timswee), 26 February
2024 (Sinoace BVI), 5 March 2024 (Rill Trading) and 7 March 2024 (Payton).
While the appellants
accept that service was “irregular” (in that it
was outside the time prescribed by the Corporations Rules), they submit
primary judge should have found that service had in fact occurred on the
relevant dates in that period, and that the primary
proceedings should continue
despite the late service, unless orders were made setting aside service.
that end, the appellants submit that the “fact of service” on the
respondents during the later periods is of importance
because there may be
deemed service as a matter of fact where a document has come to the attention of
a respondent party:
Bioaction Pty Ltd v Ogborne
[2022] FCA 436
402 ALR 542
– [39]. They submit that this principle extends to
circumstances where service has been “effected factually” but
accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Rules or the Court Rules.
As such, the appellants submit, the primary
judge “erred in not
considering the fact of service, and in failing to consider the effect of
factual service on the applications
before him”.
is a new argument that was not put to the primary judge. Leave is required to
Khalil v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services
and Multicultural Affairs
[2022] FCAFC 26
– [36]. As is well
understood, the Court must be satisfied that it is in the interests of the
administration of justice to
permit new argument on appeal. It is well
recognised that generally a party may be permitted to raise new arguments on
appeal where
there is no possibility that the case would have been conducted
differently at trial had the point been raised in that arena:
Whisprun Pty
Ltd v Dixon

make no submissions to that effect.
that is not the end of the matter. In this case the appellants face two
difficulties. One, they were represented before the
primary judge and no
explanation has been offered on the appeal for the failure to take the point
below. The other, the point is
antithetical to how the appellants conducted the
proceedings below. The appellants prosecuted interlocutory applications
to r 1.39 of the Court Rules that the time for service of the
originating process and the affidavit in support be extended in each
new argument denies that it was ever necessary to take that course. It proceeds
on the basis that, accepting that service
was irregular, the primary judge
should have found that service had in fact occurred on various dates with the
outcome being that
each proceeding should have continued absent the making of
orders, on application by the respondents, to set aside service.
foregoing are strong reasons to refuse leave to raise the new argument. In any
event, Ground 1 is without merit. For the reasons
given in Part C, once the
time for service passed, the proceedings could not be validly served absent an
order extending time. Section
51(1) of the FCA Act does not assist. The
appellants took the correct course before the primary judge in seeking an order
time for service be extended
nunc pro tunc
is no merit in the contention that service had occurred in fact with the
consequence that the onus then fell upon the respondents
to make an application
to set aside service. Service was not validly effected. This point was made by
Sinoace BVI when applying
pursuant to r 13.01(1)(c) of the Court Rules for
a declaratory order that the originating application had not been duly served
it, and applies generally for each other respondent.
these reasons, we refuse leave to raise the new argument and with it dismiss
ground provides:
His Honour should have found that, although the applicants had not effected
service of the originating process within the time provided
for by r. 2.7 of the
Federal Court
(Corporations) Rules
(Cth), the respondent[s]
had been served with the originating process after that time, and that in order
for him to exercise any
power of summary dismissal of the proceeding, His Honour
needed to conclude that the continuation of the proceeding by the applicants
was, in the circumstances, an abuse of process.
to Ground 1, this ground rests on the contention that service was in fact
achieved and then proceeds to contend that the
primary judge could only have
summarily terminated each proceeding if he was satisfied that continuation would
be an abuse of process.
It is another new argument not put to the primary
ground and the arguments in support of it are fatally flawed.
was conceded by the appellants in written submissions dated 8 May 2024 before
the primary judge that if the extension applications
failed, then each
proceeding should either be stayed or summarily dismissed (at [114]):
...[I]t is submitted that it is appropriate for the court to exercise its
discretion to extend time for service nunc pro tunc until
the date that actual
service took place. The purpose of the power to extend time for service is to
avoid an injustice. The presumptive
prejudice and absence of any special or
actual prejudice to the respondents determines that the interests of justice lie
of the extension. It is submitted that the alternative result –
to dismiss or permanently stay the proceedings – is out
of proportion with
the nature of the default.
appellants did not submit to the primary judge that summary dismissal should be
approached only if he was satisfied that continuation
of the proceedings would
be an abuse of process. That begs the question: where in an appeal governed by
the deference standard (
v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic
Church for the Diocese of Lismore

primary judge? This argument should not now be

ground is prolix. The appellants raise multiple complaints to the effect that
the primary judge’s findings that Mr Cussen
arrogated to himself control
over when service would occur at PJ [10], [166] and [167], were against the
weight of the evidence.
Six evidentiary matters are referenced by way of
particulars. In submissions, the appellants contend that the reasons of the
judge are “extraordinarily unbalanced” in that they focus
solely on factors against the grant of leave. The evidence
that it is said was
not given sufficient weight is identified in the ground as:
was only on 30 January 2024 that the liquidator obtained advice regarding the
existence of the option of making an application
to the Court to extend time for
service of the originating process, being the advice set out at Reasons at
advice received by the liquidator did not contain any advice that a failure to
serve the originating process within the time prescribed
by r 2.7 would
cause the applicants to breach the Court’s rules as to service of the
originating process;
applicants sought to, and substantially did, comply with the direction made by
Anderson J on 25 January 2024 to notify the respondent
(among others) of the
email from the Court which identified the return date of the originating process
of 2 February 2024;
email sent to the Court by Jacky Lam on 1 February 2024, read in context, gave
notice of the intention of the applicants to make
an application to the Court to
seek an extension of time within which service of the originating process and
affidavit would be effected,
rather than an intention to deliberately not serve
those documents;
liquidator was unaware until 16 February 2024 of the decision in

, and the principles with
respect to decisions of applicants not to serve an originating process and

Immediately
upon becoming aware of the decision in

substantively, the appellants submit that the primary judge conflated the
personal decision of Mr Cussen not to substantively
progress the proceedings
until completion of his investigations, with an intention to arrogate to himself
control over the process
of service. The submissions draw attention to the oral
submissions of counsel for the appellants at the first case management hearing
on 2 February 2024 before Anderson J. Relevantly, counsel submitted:
MR MILLER: In the interim, what my client, Mr Cussen, has proceeded to do is to
commence a public examination proceeding against
various parties. The public
examination proceeding has been returnable before Registrar Edwards in this
court on 17 January and the
registrar has made orders for the issue of various
summonses and orders for production of documents. There is an overlap, your
of course, in the content and subject matter of the public examinations
and the addressees of the summonses comprise either the respondents
five proceedings or their controllers and directors. Similarly, the documents
that are sought to be produced in the public
examinations comprise documents
that are relevant to these proceedings. My client, Mr Cussen, has formed the
intention, subject to
the court’s directions, of course, to proceed with
the public examinations prior to seeking to continue with these voidable
transaction claims
emphasis is placed on the last sentence of that submission. However, that is
not the end of what was put and which might
be thought to assist the
appellants’ arguments. The submission before Anderson J continued:
MR MILLER: There are three reasons for that, your Honour. The first is, there
may be facts and documents that are obtained during
the public examinations
which are relevant to the claims and/or defences made in the proceedings.
Second, it would be an efficient
use of the parties’ resources, that is,
the applicants and the respondents, to concentrate on the public examinations
and then the substantive proceedings, being the proceedings before your
Honour today. The third reason is a reason of court resource[s],
your Honour. In
my submission, it's an efficient use of resource[s] to proceed with the public
examinations first.
The court rules, of course, provided that the originating processes and
affidavits in support in these proceedings must be served
practicable; that's rule 8 06, and at least five days before the first case
management hearing. That has not been done,
your Honour. My instructions are to
apply in due course for an order under rule 1.39 of the court rules extending
the time for service
until a date that the public examinations are expected to
be concluded.
Ultimately,
counsel submitted that his instructions were to seek an adjournment of the case
management hearing for a period of two
weeks until 16 February 2024, at which
“return date my instructions will be to apply for an extension of time to
serve until
the end of May”.
case management hearing was adjourned to 16 February 2024, and resumed before
McElwaine J when Mr Fary SC for the defendant in
VID 32/2024 maintained his
client’s position that the proceeding had been purportedly served in
breach of r 2.7 of the Corporations
Rules and was not “good
service”. When it was put to Mr Fary that compliance with r 2.7 may
be dispensed with, he referenced
the discretion to be exercised and indicated
that reliance would be placed on the principles in
appellants further submit that that the primary judge failed to notice the
“transparency of the approach” taken by
primary judge commenced at PJ [163] by correctly observing that the appellants,
in order to obtain an extension of time for service,
bore the onus of providing
an adequate explanation for the delay. At PJ [164] the primary judge referenced
Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance Pty Ltd v Buzzle Operations
, Ipp JA (which he noted was referred to with approval in
In my view it would be inappropriate to allow an extension of time for the
service of a writ or statement of claim where a significant
cause of the delay
has been the willingness of the plaintiff to do nothing about service while
awaiting a decision from a litigation
funder as to whether or not to provide the
necessary funds. Were that to be regarded as a good reason to extend time, the
Court would
be allowing plaintiffs to arrogate to non-parties the right to
decide the period by which the time for service of a writ should be
That would be fundamentally in conflict with the Court’s duty to exercise,
alone, the discretion conferred upon it.
Honour then set out the summary of the principles in

which we have in part reproduced in Part C. At PJ [167], his Honour set out an
extensive extract from the written submissions

fact, the liquidator had sent virtually identical correspondence on 31 January
2024 at 10.57 am to the solicitors for Payton in
respect of VID 33/2024.
submissions of Mr Fary further reference the affidavit of Jacky Lam which in
part stated:
The applicants propose to complete the public examinations prior to continuing
with [the proceedings] for four reasons:
(a) The public examinations may reveal facts and documents that are relevant to
the further conduct of [the proceedings], the relief
sought in those
proceedings, and the claims made in those proceedings;
(b) It would be less onerous on the applicants if the public examinations were
completed first, prior to continuation of [the proceedings].
In this respect,
the administrative resources of the applicants and their solicitors can be
directed at the public examinations first,
and then towards the continuation of
[the proceedings] from June 2024 onwards;
(c) Similarly, it would be less onerous on the respondents, and their
resources, and the resources of the respondents’ legal
representatives, if
any, in [the proceedings] if the public examinations were completed first, prior
to the continuation of [the
proceedings].
reasons for proposing to complete the public examinations prior to continuing
with the proceedings are deposed to in identical
terms in the Cussen affidavit
dated 24 April 2024, at [51].
submissions continue that this evidence “starkly reveals” that Mr
Cussen deliberately determined not to serve and
to allow the documents “to
go stale for forensic and strategic purposes”, having regard to his
interests in the proceedings.
That, the submission concluded, amounted to him
arrogating for himself control over when service should occur.
oral submissions, we were taken to legal advice received by Mr Cussen (dated 30
January 2024 sent at 5.05 pm) which it was said
resulted in his decision not to
serve the originating process and affidavit in support. The advice, partly
redacted, nonetheless
relevantly provides:
As you are aware, the court sent us an email last Thursday informing us of the
case management hearing to be held at 9:30am on Friday,
2 February 2024.
In addition, the Court asked that we notify the respondents of their email and
that the respondents file a formal notice of acting
as soon as practicable.
In light of the above, we propose notifying the respondents in accordance with
the Court’s directions, however, for the reasons
outlined below, we do not
propose to serve the applications until after the conclusion of the public
examinations.
To that end, if you would like to proceed as proposed, please see for your
review and approval draft email
to the respondents.
As discussed above and previously, we consider that we should refrain from
serving the applications until after the conclusion of
the Public Examinations.
This is including for the following reasons:
examinations will be held in the week of 15 April 2024 which is relatively close
funding [has] been agreed or provided by the Funder yet, and the additional time
will allow us to come to some agreement;
there is no funding, by refraining from proceeding with the applications, we can
minimise the risk of adverse costs orders; and
can minimise further costs incurred until we have further information furnished
in the public examinations with respect to the
To proceed with an application to extend time to serve, we will need to prepare
a short affidavit deposing to the orders extending
the limitations period, the
public examinations having been commenced, the expected duration of the public
examinations, and seeking
orders under r 1.39 extending the time for service
until after the public examinations are finished.
Accordingly, please let us have your instructions to proceed with the
application to extend time for service.
advice is not entirely clear in that there was a suggestion that no steps be
taken to serve the applications until conclusion
of the public examinations, but
in contrast instructions were sought to proceed with an application to extend
the time for service.
In any event, Mr Cussen decided, on receiving the advice,
not to continue with the proceedings until after conclusion of the public
examinations: Cussen affidavit 24 April 2024, [51]. Next, at [52] he deposed
that he was aware from 30 January 2024 that he could
apply to extend the time
for service pursuant to the Court Rules and “instructed my lawyers to
proceed on that basis”.
That paragraph is ambiguous in that it fails to
reveal if the instruction was to proceed instanter or at a later time. What is
known is that Mr Cussen was ignorant of the decision in
February 2024, when on that day he instructed his solicitors to effect service
of each proceeding, and then to apply for
an adjournment until the first
available date after conclusion of the public examinations: Cussen affidavit 24
April 2024, [61] –
[62]. The interlocutory applications to extend time in
each proceeding were not filed until 12 March 2024. Hence, the obvious
that is open is that Mr Cussen did not instruct his solicitors to
proceed with those applications forthwith on 30 January 2024.
was therefore open to the primary judge to find, by adoption of counsel’s
submissions, that Mr Cussen was aware by no later
than 30 January 2024 that the
Court Rules required the making of an application to extend time for service of
each proceeding, that
the time period had by then passed and, despite that
knowledge, instructed his solicitors to advise that it was not his intention
proceed with service until after conclusion of the public examinations.
the primary judge did not disregard the legal advice provided to Mr Cussen. At
PJ [170] his Honour considered the submission
that a matter relevant to exercise
of the discretion to extend time was the fact that Mr Cussen relied on legal
advice. However,
nonetheless as the facts reveal, Mr Cussen made a strategic
decision not to prosecute the proceedings. In consequence, the primary
reasoned at PJ [170]:
With that knowledge, and for the strategic purposes to which he deposed, and
which are set out above, he took it upon himself to
decide for himself when
service should occur, for a reason that could best be summed up as
“because it suited me to do so”.
That his solicitors and counsel
were apparently unaware of the governing and well-established principles in
in those circumstances is irrelevant and the
cases on which he relied are of no avail.
conclusion was open. The primary judge did not misstate the facts or act on a
wrong principle.
should, however, be said about a reference in the submissions of Zuccubarr and
[2007] NSWCA 234
AJA. The appeal challenged the decision of the primary judge to extend the time
for service of an amended statement of
claim in an action for medical negligence
against the appellant. The original statement of claim was issued on 28 July
ceased to be valid for service on 29 November 2004. A procedural rule
required the plaintiff to serve, with the statement of claim,
a statement of
expert reports. That was not done. That deficiency was remedied when the
plaintiff brought an application to extend
time for service. When the statement
of claim was issued, investigations as to whether the plaintiff had a reasonable
prospect of
success had not been completed by his solicitors. There was
evidence that the plaintiff had been advised, based on three reports
neurosurgeons, that she did not have much prospect of success in a negligence
claim. The case as ultimately put was that the
surgeon failed to give
appropriate warnings. The primary judge concluded that there was “some
material on which a failure
to warn case might proceed”, depending on the
outcome of expert evidence:
at [25]. At [28] Handley AJA
The plaintiff’s legitimate interest in the prosecution of her claim is
balanced by the defendant’s legitimate interest
in the claim not being
prosecuted when the application is made 19 months after the expiration of the
limitation period.
[30] there is reference to the principle that a plaintiff seeking an extension
of time must establish a proper or adequate reason,
including a satisfactory
explanation for the delay. The case also raised limitation questions: the
plaintiff was out of time absent
an extension: [31] – [33].
reference in the submissions to
at [44] is out of context. It must
be read with the following which appears at [42] – [46]:
The present case is essentially different. The defendant was still in practice
and there would be no difficulties in effecting service.
The plaintiff’s
problem was that she had not decided whether to proceed and if so on what basis.
In these circumstances, in
my opinion, the case is a limitation case and not a
want of prosecution case within the reasoning in
(above). Essentially the plaintiff wanted more time within which
to decide whether she would proceed with her case.
The limitation period of three years is intended to provide a reasonable time
for a plaintiff who has suffered personal injuries
to seek and obtain
appropriate medical and legal advice and to decide whether legal proceedings are
justified. It was not suggested
that her injuries contributed to the delay.
In these circumstances delay within the limitation period is also relevant to
the exercise of the discretion to extend time for service
of proceedings. A
plaintiff who issues proceedings just before the limitation period and only then
has the merits of the case investigated
should not have any expectation of
obtaining an extension of time to enable investigations to continue. There
should also be no expectation
that time spent in this way after the statement of
claim has been issued, especially after it has become stale, will be accepted
an adequate explanation for such delays. Her case is not improved if
investigations were carried out with reasonable diligence,
Proceedings for professional negligence differ from the general run of personal
injury cases as they affect the defendant personally
and his or her professional
reputation. One may reasonably infer that considerations such as this prompted
the reduction in the time
for service of the statement of claim for cases in the
Professional Negligence List and the warnings in the Practice Direction.
The plaintiff made no attempt to explain the delay prior to the filing of the
statement of claim. Dr Teo's report is dated the day
following the issue of the
statement of claim but presumably Walsh & Blair already knew something of
its contents when they commenced
the proceedings. The date the plaintiff first
consulted Walsh & Blair is not known although the Judge inferred that this
not have happened until she lost her position with the Education Department
at the end of 2002.
[49] it was found that there was no explanation why the plaintiff’s
solicitors did not serve the statement of claim within
the required period of
four months, save that they were awaiting further expert reports. However, that
was not true in respect of
the failure to warn case which was supported by an
expert report then to hand. This led to the inference at [51] that:
These matters strengthen the inference that the statement of claim was not
served before Walsh & Blair withdrew from the case
in November 2004 because
the failure to warn case was seen to be weak and a wider case was not supported
by experts’ reports.
This inference is further strengthened by the advice
from Maurice Blackburn Cashman.
[52] it was found “there has not been a full or adequate explanation for
the delays from the end of 2002 ... Indeed the
evidence suggests that decisions
not to proceed were made on advice in June and November 2004 and February
2005”. Nor had
any explanation been given for the failure to apply for an
extension of time within the four month period allowed for service: [54].
the primary judge erred. The Court re-exercised the discretion and determined
to refuse the extension application.
in this context, the decision in
is radically different from the
facts of the present case. However, it does not follow that the primary judge
erred in adopting
that part of the submission. The submission refers to other
matters, such as the email of 15 February 2024 sent by a law graduate
Kerr in the employ of the appellants’ solicitors, which responds to
correspondence from solicitors acting for some of
the respondents to the effect
that consent would not be provided for an adjournment pending completion of the
public examinations.
Mr Kerr replied:
We are instructed that our client will not make an application to extend time
for service.
Accordingly, please find

of Neil Cussen affirmed 19 January 2024.
in the knowledge that applications to extend the time for service were
necessary, acquired no later than 30 January 2024, Mr
Cussen decided he would
not take that necessary step and instead purported to serve the proceedings and
the affidavit in support.
submissions also correctly note that orders were made on 16 February 2024,
requiring the appellants to make any application to
extend time for service by 4
pm on 8 March 2024. That order was not complied with. No formal application to
extend the time for
service was made until 12 March 2024. Mr Cussen did not
offer an explanation for the failure to comply with the orders of 16 February
primary judge at PJ [169] found that Mr Cussen’s conduct in
“arrogating to himself the role of deciding when to effect
proper service
on the respondents, flying in the face of the Rules and the applicable
principles, is made even worse in light of
the leisurely way he has approached
his task since his appointment, and his unfortunate practice of making court
applications on
the final day of limitation periods”. The finding was
plainly open on the evidence.
discretionary error is made out. This ground fails.
complaint is that the primary judge fell into discretionary error by considering
an irrelevant consideration, namely that Mr Cussen
had a practice of making
court applications on the final day of limitation periods: PJ [169].

to be attributed to each

evidence of belated applications throughout; commencing with the applications to
extend time pursuant to s 588FF(3)

is no merit in this ground.
is another prolix ground. The complaint is that the primary judge failed to
consider nine relevant considerations:
(1) the fact (as his Honour should have found) that there was no evidence that
the respondent[s] had suffered any actual prejudice
by reason of the
applicants’ late service of the originating process and affidavit in
support on it.
(2) the fact (as his Honour should have found) that the presumptive prejudice
suffered by the respondent[s] by reason of the applicants’
late service of
the originating process was minor and/or insignificant.
(3) the fact that immediately upon becoming aware of the decision in
(and by implication, that he had breached r. 2.7), the liquidator instructed
his legal advisers to effect service of the originating
process and affidavit in
support, and to apply to adjourn the proceeding[s] until after the public
examinations had been conducted;
(4) the short duration of the period from when the applicants breached r. 2.7
until they effected (factual, if not legal) service
of the originating process
and affidavit on the respondent[s];
(5) the fact that the liquidator’s decision not to serve the originating
process on the respondent[s] extended no further in
time than from 30 January
2024 (alternatively 22 January 2024) until [the relevant date of factual
(6) the fact that the liquidator’s decision not to serve the originating
process and the affidavit in support on the respondent[s]
was made by him as a
result of legal advice received from his lawyers on 30 January 2024;
(7) the fact that, notwithstanding that the applicants did not serve the
originating process and affidavit in support on the respondent[s]
in accordance
with rule 2.7, the applicants did otherwise seek to (and substantially did)
comply with the directions of the Court
in respect of them, including the
direction by the Court on 25 January 2024 that the applicants promptly notify
the respondent[s]
of the hearing to be held on the return date of 2 February
(8) the merits of the claims against the respondent[s] in the proceeding[s],
based on the present state of the evidence;
(9) the fact that the liquidator did not bring the proceeding[s] for his
personal benefit, but for the benefit of the company and
its creditors.
dealing with these complaints, it is important to keep in mind that an appeal is
constrained in matters of practice and procedure,
where there is a presumption
in favour of correctness:
Adam P Brown Male Fashions v Philip Morris Inc
[1981] HCA 39
(1981) 148 CLR 170
appellants’ contention in relation to the first consideration may be
readily disposed of. The respondents did not claim
actual prejudice. The onus
fell on the appellants to establish absence of prejudice. This consideration is
therefore irrelevant
and no error is established.
balance of the complaints may be shortly addressed seriatim. Each lacks merit.
to the second, there was obvious presumptive prejudice by reason of significant
delay. As observed in
The events the subject of the proceeding occurred more than six years prior to
the applicants seeking an extension, and more than
seven years prior to the
respondents being served. The principle of presumptive prejudice reflects the
adverse effect of the effluxion
of time on defendants’ ability to prepare
their defences.
voidable transaction proceedings as formulated were sparse in detail, extending
to no more than monetary claims for relief in
specific amounts and as stated in
each originating application. A little more detail was contained in the
affidavits of Mr Cussen
made on 19 January 2024 in each of the 2024 proceedings.
The date ranges asserted for the defeasible transactions span the period
November 2016 to 22 March 2018 as follows:
Date range of defeasible transactions
Sinoace BVI proceeding (VID 31/2024)
2 November 2016 – 22 March 2018
Zuccubarr proceeding (VID 32/2024)
6 December 2017 – 1 February 2018
Payton proceeding (VID 33/2024)
13 December 2017 – 31 January 2018
Timswee proceeding (VID 34/2024)
Rill Trading proceeding (VID 35/2024)
primary judge was alert to this. He was the judge who made the extension order
and the affidavits were read at the hearing in
June 2024. The delay relevant to
presumptive prejudice was clearly not confined to late service of the
originating applications.
primary judge did not overlook the third fact: PJ [59].
primary judge was aware of and considered the fourth and fifth considerations:
PJ [2], [3], [52], [56] and [170].
matter in the sixth point was considered, correctly in our view when addressing
to the seventh matter, the ground and the submissions in support fail to reveal
how this was material to the exercise of the discretion
reposed in the primary
judge. In any event, the primary judge was well aware of the direction given by
the Court on 25 January 2024:
PJ [49]. His Honour was also aware of what
occurred at the case management hearing on 2 February 2024: PJ [56] –
merits of the claims, matter eight, were not as correctly submitted by Payton,
ever fully ventilated before the primary judge.
The originating applications do
not reveal the merit of each claim, and the affidavits of Mr Cussen did not take
the factual basis
much further. The primary judge was well aware that the
appellants contended for substantial recovery proceedings, exceeding
$27,000,000:
PJ [27]. Nonetheless, the explanations for the delay in serving
claims that Mr Cussen considered meritorious were “wholly
inadequate”: PJ [171].
to the ninth matter, it was obvious that Mr Cussen did not bring the proceedings
for personal benefit and otiose to record that
fact. How it is said that the
failure by the primary judge to state that fact infected his discretion was left
undeveloped in submissions.
ground fails.
extension of time to apply for leave to appeal and leave to appeal will be
granted in each appeal.
primary judge was correct to:
(a) Dismiss each application to extend time in proceedings VID 31/2024 (Sinoace
BVI), VID 32/2024 (Zuccubarr), VID 33/2024 (Payton),
VID 34/2024 (Timswee) and
VID 35/2024 (Rill Trading); and
(b) Set aside the order made on 9 March 2023 in proceeding VID 410/2022 in so
far as it applied to Sinoace BVI.
primary judge erred in:
(a) Determining that he had no power to re-hear the application pursuant to s
588FF(3) for an extension of time to commence a proceeding
against Sinoace BVI;
(b) Dismissing the application to extend time for service in proceeding VID
31/2024 (Sinoace BVI).
follows that each appeal will be dismissed, save for appeal VID 754/2024 which
will be allowed. The question of costs may not
be as straightforward as
following the respective events. Time will be allowed for short written
submissions and resolution of costs
on the papers.
