Sentencing Snapshot 293: Sentencing Trends for Cultivating a Commercial
Quantity of Narcotic Plants in the Higher Courts of Victoria
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
cultivating a commercial quantity of narcotic
in the County and
Supreme Courts of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2018-19 to
Adjustments made by
the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June 2023 have been
incorporated into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on cultivating a
commercial quantity of narcotic plants and other offences is also available
Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981
provides for a set of offences involving cultivation of a narcotic plant that
distinguishes between large commercial, commercial
and non-commercial quantities
of the plant.
This Snapshot
examines the offence of cultivating a commercial quantity of narcotic plants.
The amount that constitutes a commercial
quantity depends on the type of
In relation to
cannabis, which is the most common narcotic plant involved in these offences, a
commercial quantity is 25 249 kg or
Cultivating a commercial quantity of narcotic plants is an indictable offence
that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 3,000
penalty units.
If the offence
was committed on or after 20 March 2017, it is a category 2 offence, meaning
courts must impose a custodial sentence
except in particular
circumstances.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where cultivating a commercial quantity of
narcotic plants was the principal offence, that is, cases
where this was the
offence that received the most severe
Cultivating a commercial quantity of narcotic plants was the principal
offence in 2.9% of cases sentenced in the higher courts between
2018-19 and
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 249 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of cultivating a commercial quantity
of narcotic plants.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
cultivating a commercial quantity of narcotic plants by
financial year. There
were 29 people sentenced for this offence in 2022-23, down from 44 in the
previous year. The number of people
sentenced was highest in 2018-19 (68 people)
and lowest in 2022-23 (29 people).
There were no people who received a custodial or non-custodial supervision
order for the principal offence of cultivating a commercial
quantity of narcotic
plants during the five-year

The rate of
immediate custodial sentences was lowest in 2022-23 (89.7%) and highest in

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the principal offence of cultivating a commercial quantity of
plants from 2018-19 to 2022-23.
The principal sentence describes sentences for the offence at
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves
multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the same as or
longer than the principal

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
