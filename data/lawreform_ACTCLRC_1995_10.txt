Defamation Report
Introduction
Defamation is the publication of words or images to a person that damages the
reputation of another.
A defamatory statement
is one that is likely to cause ordinary, reasonable people to think less of the
person about whom the words
or images are published. An inference that casts a
defamatory imputation is enough to bring an action.
The following are examples of defamation:
An imputation which may tend to cause a person to be hated or despised,
or cause them to be treated with contempt by their peers
The publication of material that renders a person to ridicule, even if involving
humour. The publication of a photograph that
contained an optical illusion
giving the appearance that someone was guilty of indecent exposure is defamatory
Certain caricatures have been held to be defamatory. Determining what is
defamatory is notoriously difficult in these matters.
The distinction between
artistic freedom and defamation will no doubt remain the subject of litigation
There are a number of defences that may
be raised to an action for defamation. These include justification, public
interest, privilege
(of varying degrees), fair comment, comment, as well as
other defences. Defences vary in nature throughout Australian jurisdictions.
The Task of the Committee
The defamation reference requires the Committee to make recommendations about
the reform of both the substantive and procedural
law of defamation.
Although the "pressing need" for reform has been largely assumed in submissions
to the Committee, there have been a number of reasons
put forward for the "pressing
need" for reform of ACT defamation law. Some of these reasons have proven illusory;
some have been
based on self-interest.
The Committee has proceeded from two policy bases:
Renewal: The ACT substantive law of defamation is highly fragmented.
The existing statutory provisions are antiquated. While it is
in the nature of
the common law to change and develop, defamation law, with celebrated
exceptions, has been resilient to change.
In relation to the ACT procedural law
of defamation, study has suggested the existence of a series of systemic
problems. Accordingly,
the primary reform goal of the Committee has been to
reorganise and renew the substantive and procedural law.
Uniformity: There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts to establish
a uniform Australian law of defamation (of necessity
this has only focussed
on substantive rather than procedural uniformity).
This ultimately has invoked difficult policy issues, balancing on one hand
the possibility of a uniform law adopted through
compromise with local laws
of varying similarities reflecting local concerns.
now seems an unlikely result.
Notwithstanding this, a secondary reform goal of the
Committee has been to position developing ACT law within a legal framework most
consistent with uniform developments. Accordingly, the Committee has
deliberately based this report and its draft legislation on
the broad framework
of draft legislation prepared as part of the move towards uniformity between
the Eastern States in 1992.
Social rules concerning defamation have pervaded many if not all organised societies.
Concern about defamation can be found in the earliest legal and religious writings
from different cultures. As early as the twenty-fourth
century BC, Ptahhotpe commanded:
Do not repeat slander; you should not hear it, for it is the result
of hot temper.
However, hand in hand with
rules that provided legal relief for the subject of a slander, came notions of
the need for a robust approach
to the issue. Confucius (551-479 BC) wrote:
He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind,
nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful
called intelligent indeed.
The genesis of much modern
Western defamation law is the Roman law of injury caused by insulting behaviour
and scandalous libels.
Roman law was concerned with attacks on a person's
honour and reputation rather than with freedom of expression. The Roman jurist
Ulpian noted that, under the Lex Cornelia:
If someone composes, writes or publishes something tending to bring
another into hatred, ridicule or contempt, or maliciously causes
done, even though it be published in the name of another, or even anonymously,
he can be sued under this law and
if he is found guilty, he will be declared
untrustworthy so that his word cannot be given in Court, nor can he make a will.
And by a decree of the Senate the same fate awaits anyone who publishes a scurrilous
epigram or anything else of the like, even
in shorthand, and anyone who offers
such things for sale or purchase.
Little is known of defamation law in Britain prior to the 14th Century.
However, records from the early fourteenth century
that show occasional actions by a judge or litigant as a result of a malicious
slander in open court, suggest the existence of rules concerning slander within
customary law.
In 1378 the statute known as
Scandalum Magnatum
was enacted to "protect
the fame of great men". It was used by nobles, judges and ecclesiastical dignitaries
who had been slandered.
The policy of the legislation was declared to be to
prevent discord between the classes, but the purpose of the action was to
the magnate's name by recovering damages.
Prior to the 16th Century defamation matters were considered to be properly
the purview of the ecclesiastical courts. The church
courts would hear actions
for "spiritual damage".
Those courts entertained
what were in form criminal proceedings and could sentence the guilty party to
penance, but not award
damages or costs. Telling lies about someone was a form
of immorality and was best dealt with by the church.
In the 16th Century common law judges began to entertain actions for slander
where the damage suffered was 'temporal' rather than
'spiritual'.
This seems to be a result of pressure from the
growing number of defamation litigants to have access to a remedy other than
having just a penance imposed on the offending party. A second development at
much the same time was the assumption by the Court
of Star Chamber of a criminal
of a fine, and damages
to the injured party.
At this time there was intense competition amongst
the different courts (most notably the King's Bench and Common Pleas) each
to attract additional business amongst an increasingly litigious citizenry.
This parallel development may, too, have
put pressure on the common law courts
to offer an attractive remedy in slander cases.
The popularity of 'the action for words' in the common law courts grew
remarkably. Shakespeare reflected on the preoccupation with
the evil of
defamatory comments:
For slander lives upon succession, Forever housed where it gets
Justice Dyer remarked in 1557 that such actions had become too common being brought
'for every trifling thing'. There was also concern
by judges that juries in slander
cases were awarding sums for damages quite disproportionate to the harm caused
and beyond the
ability of the wrongdoer to pay.
With the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1641, the common law courts assumed
libel was actionable
without the need to show damage, whereas slander still required proof of
damage. Slander was confined to imputations
made orally, while libel resulted
when the insult had been committed to writing.
In an attempt to stem the flow of 'actions for words' the common law courts
sought to restrict the scope by excluding words 'spoken
in anger or sport',
unless malice was alleged. The courts also introduced a construction doctrine,
in mitiori sensu (in a milder
sense), so that ambiguous or doubtful words were
to be construed in their milder sense. This policy was carried to extremes so
that seemingly absurd ambiguities were raised where no ordinary person would
have had any doubt. The rule was laid to rest
The courts then introduced the restriction that
for words to be actionable they should not only cause loss but also be capable
of bearing a defamatory meaning.
By the 18th Century the law of defamation had largely achieved its modern
form. For defamation to be committed, it was necessary
to show that the words
used 'should expose the plaintiff to hatred contempt or ridicule'
or 'tend to cause him to be shunned or avoided'
During the course of the 19th Century, attempts were made to reform the law of
defamation in England. In 1843, a select Committee
of the House of Lords
recommended the assimilation of slander and libel. It also recommended the
modification of the common law defence
of truth with the requirement to also
establish that the matter was for the public benefit. This recommendation was
accepted in England
only in relation to criminal cases.
The recommendations were adopted in the colony of New South Wales (then
comprising the areas later to become the states of Queensland
and Victoria) in
1847. In particular, the 'public benefit' requirement was introduced to
overcome objections that the common law
seemed to condone the embarrassing or
hurtful exposure of purely private matters (for example, dredging up someone's
criminal record
when he or she has long since reformed).
In NSW various changes were made to the
Defamation Act 1847
in a restatement in 1901 and then by amendment of the 1901 Act in 1909. In 1958
NSW adopted a codified statement of
the common law, but this was found to be
unsatisfactory. The present NSW Act came into effect in 1974 following a NSW
Commission report in 1971.
Victoria, after its creation as a separate colony, repealed the New South Wales
law in 1856. The law again separated the actions
of libel and slander. Today
Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the
Australian Capital Territory
apply the common law with some legislative (but
not uniform) modifications.
In the latter half of the 19th Century, Queensland embarked on a wide ranging
reform by enacting codes which were intended to
replace the common law. In 1889,
Queensland enacted a legislative statement of the cause of action and defences.
Today both Queensland and Tasmania have statutory codes based on the Indian
Penal Code of 1860 (common law principles are only
used to resolve matters of
construction and of ambiguity).
Last century, there was a tendency to decry the action of defamation. Writers
vigorously attacked the concept:
It takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt
you to the heart; the one to slander you and the other to get the
news to you.
It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things
against one, behind one's back, that are absolutely and
entirely true.
The point that is really at issue remains
untouched. Libel settles nothing.
Nevertheless, the basic issues involved in defamation cannot
be dismissed so easily. Defamation cannot be underestimated as a means
ensuring integrity in reporting of fact.
Defamation laws are quite draconian and make us watch every
single word that goes in the paper.
The Reference
The Committee held a series of public hearings and consulted widely with individuals
and representative organisations both locally
and interstate. Written and oral
submissions to the Committee identified a broad range of competing interests.
Competing Interests
Some submissions questioned the basic rationale of defamation laws. The Free
Speech Committee argued that the notions of reputation
that underpin current
defamation law are based largely on outmoded notions of class, race and gender.
Others proposed that defamation
law should not apply to particular types of
material. The Australian Society of Authors argued that defamation law is
inappropriate
to imaginative works. Defamation deals with facts, imaginative
works do not. For example, because a novel is not true, the major
defences of
defamation are not open to an author or publisher of fiction. It considers it
very improbable that, if imaginative writers
were exempted from defamation law,
such writing would become a disguised form of journalism. The Australian
Society of Authors provided
three examples of where literary works have been
pulped or edited (and subjected to payment of damages) due to alleged
in those works. Many authors earn less that $10,000, but under
publishers' contracts, they are liable for the costs of any defamation
Some submissions stressed the important nature of the law of defamation. The
Australian Press Council proposed that a guarantee of
the human right of
freedom of speech should be incorporated into Commonwealth and State
constitutions.
Some submissions suggested that the existing law protected particular market
structures. It was suggested that the possibility of
very high damages awards
may be attractive to media proprietors because it represented a major barrier
to entry by smaller-scale
competitors. It was also argued that existing
newspapers have a monopoly which they abuse because they "know how to get away
it", using all defences whether a valid or not to make proceedings long,
complex and expensive.
Some submissions pointed to the cost implications of complexity in the law. It
was argued that getting good legal advice on defamation
could be a lottery
because so few lawyers understand it (and specialist advice is expensive). The
law needed to be simpler so that
more lawyers can competently deal with the
issue. The law needed to be more accessible and legal aid should be available.
it was also argued that if journalists produced material that was
accurate and fair there would be few problems. The reason litigation
protracted and expensive is that this is the way media defendants make it.
The Canberra Times argued that media organisations provide the public with a
huge volume of information in a tight time frame. In
providing information with
such speed there is an inevitable trade off in accuracy and fairness. The law
should recognise the public
interest in having information delivered quickly
and not place such strict requirements of proof on the media. The law at
is weighted too much in favour of preserving reputation rather than
respecting the right of the public to have information and debate.
cases unnecessarily clog the courts and use talent that could be better used on
more pressing cases such as personal injury,
crime, family law. Cases rarely
get decided within two years. In these circumstances, actions are no longer
money. The Canberra Times already used corrections,
apologies and replies through the Letters page frequently, but still many want
money. Defamation is a sterile area of the law that seems to achieve nothing
for the community. It provides occasional undeserved
windfalls for some lucky
plaintiffs. Wholesale fundamental reform is needed. The Canberra Times
estimates that defamation actions
add one cent per copy to the cost of the
Canberra Times, a cost that is passed to the consumer.
Others argued that the defamation laws have made rich people and politicians
richer, at the same time giving little to ordinary people.
It was suggested
that the solution was to make defamation laws at the federal level and exclude
protection from those who hold public
office or who are public figures.
The ALP (ACT Branch) believed that the defamation law in the ACT currently
favours the protection of an individual's reputation to
the detriment of free
speech. The law needs to be clearer, more accessible and more easily
understood. The law should reflect a proper
balance between free speech and the
protection of the individuals reputation.
The AMA argued that the medical profession has come under increasing attack
from the media. Medical practitioners now regard themselves
as an 'aggrieved
group'. The AMA argued that doctors rely solely on their good name to attract
patients. A good reputation takes
a long time to build up. Media comment, even
if subsequently proven false can permanently damage a doctor's professional
reputation.
If media comment continues to be indiscriminate, biased and unfair
then the chances of attracting good quality doctors to the ACT
will be greatly
diminished.
The ACT Law Society and legal practitioners played an active role in
consideration of the reference. There was a great diversity
of opinion within
the profession; some proposed the abolition of the cause of action while others
proposed the simple adoption of
the law in another jurisdiction. The Law
Society argued that in reform of the law the plaintiff must not be ignored. A
should have the right to a trial on the truth of the matter, the
right to vindication by the judgment of that trial, and the right
to an award
of damages.
Balancing Interests
Against this background of diverse and, to some extent, irreconcilable
interests, the Committee has attempted to provide a modern
balanced form to ACT defamation law.
The Committee takes as its starting point the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights which gives expression to a number
of fundamental rights.
The original terms of the defamation reference issued on 7 September 1990 state
that there is a need to strike
a contemporary balance between two competing
(1)No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his
attacks on his honour
and reputation.
(2)Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such
interference or attacks.
(1)Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.
(2)Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas of all kinds,
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of
art, or through any other
media of his choice.
(3)This exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article
carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It
may therefore be
subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided
by law and are necessary:
For respect of the rights or reputations of others;
For the protection of national security or of public order (order public),
or of public health or morals.
The original terms of reference
referred to (without endorsing) criticisms of the present law of defamation
that it was irrelevant,
the cost to the individual and community was too high
and there were delays in obtaining acceptable redress. The Committee was
of these criticisms, the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and the public benefit of the diffusion of accurate
information when
considering proposals for reform.
Reform of the Substantive Law of Defamation
The Committee makes the following recommendations concerning the substantive
law of defamation.
The Committee received no submission supporting the retention of the existing
Accordingly, for the reasons set out
in detail below, the Committee believes that the ACT Legislative Assembly should
laws concerning unlawful attacks on a person's honour and reputation.
Recommendation: The ACT Legislative Assembly should enact a new
defamation law.
The existing defamation laws are obscure
contradictory
and fragmented. These laws were inherited from
New South Wales early this century but have since been repealed in that State.
section 6 of the Imperial Act 21 Jas. 1 c. 16 (1623) was an early attempt
to discourage actions for slander.
the Imperial Act 32 Geo. 3 c. 60 (1792) dealt with criminal procedure in
trials for libel;
the Imperial Act 60 Geo. 3 and 1 Geo. 4 c. 8 (1819) provided for the seizure
of libellous papers;
the Defamation Act 1901 of New South Wales (No 22, 1901) provides the basic
structure for civil and criminal actions in the ACT;
the Defamation (Amendment) Act 1909 of the State of New South Wales (No.
22, 1909) provides for certain statutory defences to
a civil or criminal action
for defamation.
The Committee
believes that these laws should be repealed.
Recommendation: The following laws should be repealed: the Defamation
Act 1901; the Defamation (Amendment) Act 1909; 32 Geo. 3 c.
60 (1792); 60 Geo.
3 and 1 Geo. 4 c. 8 (1819); and section 6 of 21 Jas. 1 c. 16 (1623).
The common law rules concerning defamation are fragmented across
the statutory provisions and the decisional law that makes up the
common law.
It is inaccessible. Various rules within the common law are archaic while
others are at the cutting edge of social change.
In the course of its research, the Committee noted a number of older common law
offences that remain law in the ACT. These offences
(the common law
misdemeanours of criminal, blasphemous, seditious and obscene libel) are no
longer appropriate in the ACT. The Committee
believes that they should be
Recommendation: The common law misdemeanours of criminal, blasphemous,
seditious and obscene libel should be abolished.
The Free Speech Committee argued that the common law is uncertain
and confusing. This uncertainty has led to the media engaging in
unnecessary self-censorship. Specialist practitioners working in the field do
not necessarily share this perspective. The
Committee considers that
inaccessible laws are capable of causing great injustice to individuals. It
notes that wholesale change
can sometimes also lead to uncertainty and
confusion as the metes and bounds of the new rules are tested. The Committee
concerned to balance the competing issues of the inaccessibility of
the law with the undoubted strengths within a common law system.
The Committee has concluded that in the case of defamation law, the cause of
action and the defences to the cause of action should
be set out expressly in
legislation. However, the Committee was mindful of the continuing relevance and
value of much of the decisional
law making up the common law. Giving a
statutory form to the cause of action and defences is not intended to restrict
the ability
of courts to use the decisional law in particular situations
(particularly in the assessment of damages).
Recommendation: Causes of action and defences should be included in the
legislation.
The common law will continue to develop, as will procedural and statutory
law in other like jurisdictions.
Accordingly,
the Committee recommends that the law of defamation be reviewed as necessary
with a view to incorporating such
developments as are appropriate.
Recommendation: The new law should be kept under review with a view to
incorporating appropriate developments in the common law.
It is customary to include a number of `housekeeping' provisions in ACT law.
These include provisions dealing with the name of the
law, a statement of the
purpose of the law, when the law is to take effect, the effect of the law on
incidents that occurred before
the new law came into effect and definitions.
The Committee considers that the law should be cited as the Defamation Act
because the form of the legislation proposed by the Committee
is sufficiently
similar to the existing subject matter of existing defamation law and the word
defamation is commonly used and understood
to apply to attacks on a person's
honour and reputation.
Recommendation: The new law should be known as the Defamation
The Committee considers that the stated purpose of the proposed
Defamation Act should be to balance the right to freedom of speech
right to protection from unlawful attacks on a person's honour and reputation.
A purpose clause in the law should identify
the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights as constituting the preferred expression of these rights.
Consideration
might be given to including the articles in a schedule to the
Recommendation: The stated purpose of the new law should be to balance
the right of freedom of expression (expressed in Article 19
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) with the right to the
protection of the law against unlawful attacks
on a person's honour and
reputation (expressed in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights).
The Committee considers that it is desirable that there be a period of time
between the formal passage of the proposed law and
its coming into effect. This
would enable the Government and private agencies to take steps to publicise
the provisions of
the new law. Accordingly, the normal provision for the commencement
of the Act should be made.
Recommendation: The normal provision for the commencement of the law
should be made.
The Committee believes that the Act should not prejudice the
substantive law applicable in relation to a publication that occurred
the Act came into effect. Accordingly it should be clearly expressed to have
prospective effect. Provisions in the Act designed
to expedite the carriage of
matters, being procedural, will immediately apply to cases whether or not the
cause of action preceded
the commencement of the law.
Recommendation: The law should be clearly expressed to have a
prospective effect. However, provisions in the law designed to expedite
carriage of matters should apply to all cases immediately.
Such interpretive provisions as are necessary should be included
in the Act:
The Committee considers that "substantially true" should be defined to mean
true in substance or not materially different from the
In a number of the proposed defences, there is a requirement that an act of
the defendant must have been done in `good faith'. Good
faith is often equated
with the absence of bad faith or the absence of dishonesty. The Committee
considers that it is appropriate
for a court to start from the presumption that
all acts are done in good faith unless there is persuasive evidence that the
question was done in a deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth.
This approach places the burden of proof of establishing that
an act was done
in a deliberate, complete or reckless disregard for the truth onto the
Recommendation: Provision should be made for the
definition of certain terms and the approach to be taken in relation to `good
ACT statute law does not set out the cause of action for defamation; plaintiffs
rely upon a common law cause of action. At common
law the cause of action differed
depending on whether the defamation was a slander or a libel. A libel was defamatory
matter communicated
to a recipient by sight such as a newspaper or picture. A
slander was defamatory matter communicated to a recipient by hearing such
For historical rather than practical
reasons, different procedural rules applied to each action. In the ACT, these
distinctions
have no practical effect in civil proceedings.
The Committee notes the submission from the John Fairfax Group arguing that
the definition of defamation should be left to the
common law.
At common law, use of defamatory words is an
actionable tort for loss of reputation. The person who claims to have been defamed
may sue the person making the defamatory statement for compensation for that
loss of reputation. Once the person claiming to
have been defamed has shown
that the statement, words or image has a defamatory meaning, it is up to the
person who made the
statement to establish a defence.
For the reasons noted above, the Committee rejects this approach. The Committee
believes that two new civil causes of action should
be given statutory form and
that these two new statutory causes of action should cover the field.
- general cause of action
The Committee recommends that there should be a general cause of action for
defamation.
Defamation Act 1974
in New South Wales makes every imputation conveyed
by a defamatory matter a separate cause of action. The common law approach adopted
in the ACT allows the court to consider the full effect of defamatory matter
The Committee has stated previously that the approach in the New South Wales
Act tends to encourage barren semantic speculation
matter which results in interminable interlocutory skirmishes.
The Committee agrees that 'imputations' are properly dealt with by way of particulars
and should not give rise to separate
causes of action.
The cause of action should be based on the existing common law concept of
defamation. The Committee notes that defamation can
arise from both the ordinary
meaning of the material or the innuendo, or the defamatory imputation, carried
by the material.
The Committee sees no reason to dwell on this distinction in
the formulation of a statutory cause of action.
Recommendation:
A person about whom a defamatory statement is made or conveyed has a
cause of action against the person who makes or conveys the
statement to another person.
A defamatory statement is one that effects a person's reputation,
office, profession, calling, trade or business and tends to: lower
a person in
the estimation of reasonably minded persons generally; cause that person to be
shunned or avoided; or expose that person
to hatred, contempt or ridicule.
A defamatory statement may be made or conveyed: by written or printed
words or in some other permanent form; or by spoken words,
sounds, looks,
signs, gestures or in some other non-permanent form (including ideas or words
conveyed through an electronic or other
of the dead
At common law a personal action dies with the person. The personal representatives
of a deceased plaintiff cannot start an action
after the death of a plaintiff
even if special damage has accrued to the plaintiff's estate. Similarly, an action
cannot be commenced
against the personal representatives of a deceased defendant.
The rationale applying the rule to defamation cases might be that defamation concerns
itself with the reputation of a person, and
resultant damages compensate that
person for loss of that reputation, hurt feelings and embarrassment. The deceased
cannot suffer
hurt feelings and embarrassment and cannot be compensated.
The Free Speech Committee opposed permitting an action to vindicate the
reputation of a dead person.
Notwithstanding this, the majority
the Committee recognised that the relatives and friends of the deceased could
well desire to see that reputation vindicated.
The majority considers that the
common law is inadequate because:
The public interest is best served by honest information being placed in
the public arena. It is undesirable that dishonest information
be placed in the
public arena simply because it concerns someone who can no longer defend his or
her reputation.
The deceased obviously has no way of refuting claims against him
or her, so it is unfair to allow such attacks. A cowardly attack
person should give the person's estate a right of action against the attacker.
The majority of the Committee thought that a balanced approach was to
allow a period after the death of a person where the estate
of that person
could sue. After that time no action could lie. The majority felt that general
damages should not be awarded in such
a case, as the decision of the court will
have the effect of vindicating the reputation of the deceased.
Recommendation: A personal representative of a dead person about whom a
defamatory statement is made or conveyed, with the leave of
the Court, should
have a cause of action on behalf of the estate against the person who makes or
conveys the defamatory statement
to another person.
A defamatory statement is one that is made within 12 months of the death
of the dead person and tends to lower the remembrance of
the dead person in the
estimation of reasonably minded persons generally.
A defamatory statement may be made or conveyed: by written or printed
words or in some other permanent form; or by spoken words,
sounds, looks,
signs, gestures or in some other non-permanent form (including ideas or words
conveyed through an electronic or other
Such an action may only be brought by and in the name of the personal
representative of the deceased person for the benefit of the
deceased person's
Damages cannot be awarded for general damages in such a case.
after commencement of an action
At common law, a defamation action ended with the death of either party to the
case. Section 5(2) of the
Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1955
specifically excludes defamation cases from the statutory survival of other
forms of action.
The survival or otherwise of a cause of action has been subject to considerable
The Committee considers that the
issue is of largely academic interest in the ACT but that it would appear to
be an unfair
result for the estate of either the plaintiff or the defendant
to bear the cost of an unconcluded action because the case ended
with the death
of that party. The majority felt that general damages should not be awarded
in such a case, as the decision
of the court will have the effect of vindicating
the reputation of the deceased.
Recommendation: Section 5(2) of the
Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1955
should be amended to provide that where a person who
has a right or liability in respect of defamation dies, the right or liability
passes to the executor of the person's will or the administrator of the
person's estate.
Damages cannot be awarded for general damages in such a case.
General Issues
The Committee recommends that there should be a number of specific defences to
an action for defamation. These defences are set out
below. A number of these
defences mirror existing common law and statutory defences; as part of the
Committee's general approach,
the existing defences have been subsumed within
the statutory framework.
The primary (and most convincing) defence to defamation is truth. Abraham Lincoln
argued that: "Truth is generally the best vindication
against slander".
In practice, defendants seldom rely on truth as a defence. Most defamation cases
proceeding to the defence stage in the ACT seem
to have done so on the joint assumption
that the matters complained of were untrue.
At common law truth, by itself, constituted a complete defence to an action
in defamation. A United Kingdom Law Reform Commission
report in the early nineteenth
century recommended that this simple defence be qualified by the requirement
that the truth
should also be a proper matter for the public domain. This recommendation
was rejected in the United Kingdom in relation to the
civil action but was adopted
in NSW in 1847 in relation to both civil and criminal actions and, ultimately,
the ACT. The common
law position was adopted in Victoria. This split in approach
between the jurisdictions has been a continuing source of controversy.
Developments
in the United States effectively restricting public figures from taking defamation
action have placed additional
tensions on the defence.
At common law, truthful statements define reputation rather than damage it.
A defamatory matter is presumed to be false
and the defendant cannot lead evidence of truth unless a plea of 'justification'
If the defendant can prove that
the statement is true, then that statement is not defamatory. It is not enough
to have a belief
in the truth of the matters contained in the statement. The
motivation of the maker of the statement has no significance in relation
this defence.
The common law formulation
does not extend protection to privacy.
The ACT has inherited a modified common law position.
Under section 6 of the
Defamation Act 1901
the defendant must prove truth
and that the statement was made "for the public benefit". In order to rely on
this defence the
defendant, in pleading his or her defence, must allege that
it was for the public benefit that the alleged defamatory matters
were published
and provide reasons in support of such an assertion.
It is argued that this imports significant protection
for privacy into the law.
There was considerable difference of opinion about the elements of this
defence. The Australian Press Council supported as a first
preference, truth
alone as a defence. However, it would also support truth and privacy. The
Council proposed that the plaintiff should
have the onus of proving that a
publication is of a private sensitive fact.
The Australian Society of Authors supported the defence of truth alone, without
public interest or public benefit. It pointed
to jurisdictions where truth alone
is the defence and argued that no problems have arisen in these jurisdictions.
It also asserted
that the defence is illogical, even unavailable, in relation
to imaginative works such as fiction. In relation to a work of fiction,
can any author prove 'truth' in a defamation action? The Committee notes that
this not a uniquely modern problem.
The John Fairfax Group favoured truth alone as a defence. It submitted that its
use in several jurisdictions had not resulted in
any undue invasion of privacy.
However, if truth alone is not possible, the Group would support truth and
publication genuinely relates to a matter of public
interest. The onus should be on the plaintiff to prove that the published
was an invasion of privacy, and did not relate to a matter of public
The Free Speech Committee recommended that the public interest or public benefit
requirement be removed from the defence of truth.
The Free Speech Committee
argued that the reasons put forward for the retention of the public interest
requirement
misconstrues the object of defamation
law. Other legislation such as racial discrimination and equal opportunity legislation
exists to remedy this issue. The introduction of privacy legislation would also
remedy this issue. There is no need for defamation
law to also perform this
Similarly the ALP (ACT Branch) submission argued in favour of truth alone
together with a reversal of the onus of proof. It argued
that to retain the
'public interest' requirement is to confuse the object of defamation laws in
protecting reputation with that of
protecting privacy. The end result is that
the public interest requirement is just one more obstacle to free speech
without adequately
protecting privacy.
The ACT Law Society believed that truth and public interest should be the test.
At present, the plaintiff needs only to raise the matter and the defendant is
put to the proof of truth. A minority of the Committee
favoured a reversal of
the onus of proof on the basis that the plaintiff in other tortious cases is
obliged to establish all the
grounds for the action. However, the majority of
the Committee agreed that it was appropriate for the defendant to prove the
of a matter. In general, it is the defendant who originally publishes the
defamatory matter. The defendant, having published the
material, should be put
Of all the issues to be considered by the Committee the formulation of this
defence proved to be the most difficult. The Committee
acknowledges the
attraction of moving back to the common law defence of truth alone.
The Committee notes that the object of defamation laws have traditionally
protected a basket of rights and privileges going to
the dignity of a person.
of Article 17 of
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The
Committee believes that the privacy of the individual is deserving
protection. It believes that the most effective and appropriate way to achieve
this is to develop a separate action
for the invasion of privacy.
Recommendation: The Committee recommends the development of a separate
action for the invasion of privacy.
The Committee acknowledges the practical difficulty of developing such an
action. In the absence of such an action, the majority
of the Committee felt that the principle defence
should reflect the present ACT position.
It is an appropriate mechanism to protect privacy
in the context of defamation.
Recommendation:
The defence of truth should be available where the defendant establishes
that the matter is true and the publication of the matter
was warranted in the
public interest.
The Committee believes that the defence of truth should also be
available in cases where substantial truth has been established.
simple variation of the general defence to avoid unmeritorious claims for a
technical defamation.
Recommendation: The defence of truth should be available where the
defendant establishes that the matter is substantially true but
did not further
harm the plaintiff, because of the substantial truth of the matter, and the
publication of the matter was warranted
in the public interest.
In America, the defence of justification has been radically altered by what
is known as the Public Figure Test. To succeed in
a defamation claim, a plaintiff
who is a 'public official' or 'public figure' must prove that the defendant
acted with actual
malice (actual knowledge of the falsity or the published material
or reckless disregard as to its truth).
Furthermore, the plaintiff must prove actual
malice 'with convincing clarity', an onus of proof that goes far beyond the
'balance of probabilities' used in civil cases.
The ALP (ACT Branch) suggested that that adoption of a public figure test would
only serve to further complicate the area. Professor
Michael Chesterman noted
that a public figure test may in practice operate against the interests of
"free speech advocates" because
of the emphasis it puts on "malice" or
"recklessness".
The Australian Press Council believed a public figure test should be
introduced. It argued that public figures (particularly parliamentarians)
a much greater access to the media than ordinary persons, seek publicity and
have a great deal of control over what information
they provide to the media
and so to the public. Parliamentarians enjoy the protection of privilege and
should be subject to scrutiny.
The Australian Society of Authors argued for a public figure test. It argued
that a public figure test encourages open debate on
political issues. A public
figure test is concerned with matters of public concern, not the private lives
of individuals. Although
it saw some difficulty in defining what or who is a
public figure, this difficulty should not preclude consideration of such a
It found no evidence to suggest that a public figure test would
discourage persons from entering public life.
The Free Speech Committee recommended that a public figure test be introduced.
It should require a public figure to show actual malice
by the publisher - ie,
publication of a deliberate lie or reckless publication amounting to lie -
before damages are recoverable.
The US Courts have no difficulty in defining
who is a public figure. Public figure plaintiffs are successful on a comparable
with private persons. An alternative approach is that where a publisher,
after making all reasonable inquiries and on reasonable
grounds, believes
material to be true, and publishes a correction, the defence of justification
should operate.
The John Fairfax Group supported the introduction of a public figure test. It
argued that public figures bring a large proportion
of defamation actions.
Public figures should be subject to intense public scrutiny although the
private lives of public figures should
not come under the same scrutiny. The
judge should determine whether a person is a public figure, and whether the
matter published
is one of public concern. If these matters are found, then the
plaintiff should only succeed if the jury finds that the publication
deliberately false.
The Committee rejects the arguments put forward in favour of adoption of the
public figure test.
In the Committee's view,
such a test has difficulties in relation to Article 17 of the International
Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and represents an unwarranted intrusion
into the liberties of persons who enter public life. Under the existing
proposed) law, the Committee notes that there is "...no doubt that the private
activities of a person holding public office
or participating in public affairs
will be a matter of public interest to the extent that these private activities
his or her fitness to hold the office in question."
of political expression
The Committee considers that it should be a defence that the defendant was exercising
his or her freedom of political expression,
or communication for political purposes.
This defence should be qualified to the extent that the defendant should have
believed in the truth of the matters, that the matter
complained of was not published
in reckless disregard of the truth and was a reasonable exercise of the defendant's
right of political
expression. The Committee notes the decisions of the High Court
of Australia regarding the finding and widening of `implied rights'
Constitution
Theophanous v Herald and Weekly Times Ltd
Stephens v West Australian Newspapers
are authority for the proposition that
Constitution
protects, to a certain extent, communication for political purposes.
The Committee is in agreement with the desirability to provide
added protection
for those wishing to comment on political matters, and the majority
regards the legislative endorsement of the Court's decision as a desirable part
of a new Defamation Act for the Australian Capital
Territory. In any event, the
adoption of such a defence is, at least as to national political expression, constitutionally
Recommendation: The defence of political expression should be available
as a defence as to any matter complained of, if the defendant
establishes that
the defendant believed the matter to be true at the time the matter was
published and that the matter complained
of was not published in reckless
disregard of the truth and was a reasonable exercise of the defendant's freedom
of political expression.
The ACT relies on the common law formulation with a number of statutory additions.
At common law, all statements made in the course of proceedings of, and all
documents published to, or under the authority of, parliaments
and the courts
are accorded absolute privilege. It is important to note that absolute
privilege applies to the actual event or document.
It does not extend to media
reports of the event or document.
Section 5A of the
Defamation (Amendment) Act 1909
provides defences for
the publication of parliamentary reports and other matters including:
a report, paper, votes or proceedings published by order, or under the authority,
of a parliamentary body
or a committee
of such a body;
a copy of any such report, paper, votes or proceedings; or
a fair extract from, or fair abstract or fair summary of, any such report,
paper, votes or proceedings.
This statutory defence is not available if it
is proved that the defendant did not publish the matter in good faith for
public information
or for the advancement of education.
The ALP (ACT Branch) suggested that the defence should be extended to the
pronouncements of politicians in the course of their work,
eg. letters to
constituents, committee work and press releases. The Australian Society of
Authors proposed that proof stages of parliamentary
debates should be
absolutely privileged.
The Committee agrees that there should be a defence of absolute privilege
as there are certain occasions on which "...public policy
and convenience require
that a [person] should be free from responsibility for the publication of defamatory
Absolute privilege denies the plaintiff the opportunity to vindicate his or her
reputation. Accordingly, the occasions of absolute
privilege should be limited
to a number of specific situations where it is in the public interest that
frank and legally uninhibited
discussion occur. Such situations clearly
encompass proceedings before parliament, courts, tribunals and formal
government inquiries.
Recommendation: The defence of absolute privilege should be available if
the defendant establishes that the publication was made by
or on behalf
* a judicial officer, member, counsel, jury, witness or party in the
course of any proceedings before any court;
* a member, counsel, witness or party in the course of any proceedings
before a specified non-curial body
* a person in the course of any proceedings before a parliamentary body
* a person in the course of any proceedings authorised by law.
The Committee considers that the defence should extend to a
report (or other further publication) of the proceedings if the defendant
establishes that the report was authorised for publication by the relevant
body. This would cover, for example, the publication of
the order of a court
when authorised by the court.
Recommendation: The defence of absolute privilege should extend to any
further publication of the (above) proceedings if the defendant
establishes
that the report was authorised for publication by or on behalf of the relevant
Less obvious is the question whether it should apply to processes
ancillary to such proceedings. Should the law protect a person
complaint that leads to the establishment of a non-curial body? The Committee
considers this to be appropriate in relation
to a body which is not formally
convened until after a complaint is made.
Recommendation: The defence of absolute privilege should be available if
the defendant establishes that the publication was made by
or on behalf of the
defendant in establishing the jurisdiction or need for the establishment of a
specified non-curial body.
At common law, statements made by one officer of state to another in the course
of their official duty attracts absolute privilege.
The ambit of the defence is unclear and should
be stated in a modern form.
Recommendation: The defence of absolute privilege should be available to
communications within Government concerning matters of state.
The ACT relies on the common law formulation with a number of statutory
enhancements.
At common law, protection is granted under the defence of qualified privilege
to statements, even if defamatory and not justified
by the defence of truth,
where the person who makes the statement has a legal, moral or social interest
or duty to make it
to a person having a corresponding interest or duty to receive
The defence fails if a statement was
motivated by malice.
Mr Bruce Connell argued that the existing law is sufficient. The practical
rules are simple. A journalist should ask:
have you checked your facts?
are there inconsistencies?
are you telling only one side of the story?
is it a beat up?
are you attempting to be too smart?
if you are going to make a comment, are you sure you have the facts?
with fair reports of Parliament, is the editing selective?
The Canberra
Times proposed that qualified privilege should be changed to include specific
documents and utterances including: proceedings
of all duly constituted public
meetings in the ACT; press statements issued in the name of a member of the
Legislative Assembly;
and press statements issued by all ACT and federal
government departments and government bodies. It argued that the media has a
to publish and comment on matters of public importance and that the public
has a corresponding right to receive or interest in receiving
The Australian Society of Authors argued that qualified privilege should
recognise a duty-interest relationship between a newspaper
and its readers, and
book publishers and authors and their readers.
The Free Speech Committee noted that common law qualified privilege is only
available where there is a reciprocity of duty or interest
between the
publisher and those to whom the material is published. There is no relationship
of duty/interest between the media and
the public unless a person has been
publicly attacked in which case the media is under a duty to publish a counter
attack, or to
correct incorrect material. The Free Speech Committee proposed
that this defence should be widened to include matter where it would
view of the great majority of people of good sense that the subject dealt with
is such that the desirability of the public
being informed outweighed the risk
of injury to reputation." The Free Speech Committee noted that qualified
privilege is lost if
the publisher was motivated by malice -ie. an "improper
motive" or lack of honest belief in the truth of what was published. The
Speech Committee argued that this is a double standard when the publisher's
motive (ie. good faith) is irrelevant to determining
whether matter is
defamatory. The Free Speech Committee recommended that qualified privilege
should not be lost unless the defendant
published knowing the material was
false or with a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. It recommended that
if malice is to
defeat qualified privilege, it has to be proved against each
individual defendant.
Various jurisdictions including the ACT have extended the defence of qualified
privilege to a wider range of statements. Occasions
of qualified privilege are
listed in Section 5 of the
Defamation Amendment Act 1909
providing a
defence for the publication in newspapers of matters "for the information of
the public". The statutory protection applies

or either House of the Parliament or of the Parliament of

justice, whether such proceedings are preliminary or interlocutory

been prohibited by the court or has been ruled
to be inadmissible by the court;

protection is restricted to material published in good faith for the
information of the public in a newspaper. A publication is
said to be made in
good faith for the information of the public if the person by whom it is made
is not actuated in making it by
ill-will to the person defamed, or by any other
improper motive, and if the manner of the publication is such as is ordinarily
fairly used in the case of the publication of news. In the case of the
publication of certain reports of proceedings referred to
above, it is evidence
of a want of good faith if the proprietor, publisher, or editor has been
requested by the person defamed to
publish in the newspaper a reasonable letter
or statement, by way of contradiction or explanation of the defamatory matter,
refused or neglected to publish the same.
The Committee considers that there are a number of situations in which matter
is published that should be protected by a defence
of qualified privilege
except where it can be shown that the publisher was not acting reasonably.
The Committee sees considerable merit in providing a workable "media defence".
In some cases, the press should be able to raise a matter that they can not
prove is true, but believe the public has an `interest'
in knowing of it. The
`interest' must be more than a simple wish to be entertained; a public purpose
or interest must be thereby
served. They must be able to establish that they
acted reasonably in all the circumstances.
Recommendation: There should be a defence of qualified privilege for a
publication, if in respect of the matter published, the recipient
interest or apparent interest in having information on some subject, and the
matter is published to the recipient in the course
of giving to the recipient
information on that subject, and the conduct of the publisher in publishing
that matter is reasonable
in the circumstances.
reports and official and public documents
At common law, qualified privilege attaches to fair and accurate reports of judicial
and quasi judicial tribunals in which there
is a determination of matters in which
the general public has a legitimate interest.
The defence fails if a statement was motivated
There can be difficulty in the application of the common law where a determination
has to be made as to whether a report is protected
or not under qualified privilege.
New South Wales has created certainty in its legislation by listing reports
that attract
privilege in Schedule 2 of their Act.
The Committee agreed that this would be a worthwhile approach in the ACT.
Recommendation: There should be a "protected report" defence for the
publication in good faith of a report of proceedings of a kind
specified in a
schedule to the Act or a copy of such a document or an extract or abstract
from, or summary of, such a document.
notices and official notices and reports
The Committee considers that certain specific protections should apply to
official notices.
Recommendation. There should be a defence for the publication in good
faith of a notice in accordance with a direction of a court
of any country.
There should be a defence for the publication in good faith of any
notice or report in accordance with an official request.
If there is an official request that a notice or report be published to
the public generally or a section of the public, and the
notice or report is or
relates to a matter of public interest, there should be a defence for a
publication in good faith of the notice
or report, or an extract or abstract
from, or a report or summary of, the notice or report.
However, this defence should not affect any liability in defamation of a
person making such an official request.
The Free Speech Committee recommended that a defendant relying on comment as a
defence should be required only to show that the defendant
(or the defendant's
servant or agent) honestly held the opinion contained in the defamatory
material, not that they believed the
imputations conveyed.
The John Fairfax Group proposed the adoption of NSW
Defamation Act

useful. The defence should not be defeated if the imputations

was based on proper material for comment, the comment represented the opinion

or the defendant's servant or agent (or was the comment of a
The Committee considers that there should be specific protections afforded to
the expression of opinion based on material that would,
of itself, attract a
defence from an action of defamation.
Recommendation: There should be a defence of comment of the defendant to
the extent to which a publication is an expression of opinion
based on material
that would, of itself, attract a defence from an action of defamation and at
the time when the comment was made,
the comment represented the defendant's
opinion, and the comment relates to a matter of public interest.
There should be a defence of comment of an employee or agent of the
defendant to the extent to which a publication is an expression

Defamation Act 1901
provide for apologies and payment into court and
for a defence of apology and payment into court. The Committee notes that these
provisions are largely ignored in practice both in this jurisdiction and elsewhere.
The Australian Press Council is opposed to court-imposed corrections and
retractions. The Council argued that such a procedure may
require the press to
print corrections to matters they know are true (but cannot prove to be true)
or sincerely believe to be true.
However, an early apology or correction that
is court-approved should be available as an alternative to damages unless
economic loss
can be proved. The publisher and complainant should be able to
seek approval by the court of the form and manner of the correction,
correction should bar proceedings for general damages.
The Australian Society of Authors agreed with early retraction, correction or
apology (in the terms and form as prescribed by a Court)
and argued that this
should result in no or highly restricted damages. It argued that if no damages
were recoverable, then this may
be a real reform, but that restricted damages
may merely be the same as the current procedure for mitigating damages. In
to literary works, it saw problems with how retractions would be
published but argued that the literary pages of major newspapers
or literary
magazines would be appropriate vehicles. It argued that a lot more
consideration should be given to the mechanics of
these sorts of remedies.
The Free Speech Committee recommended that the powers of the courts be
increased to order the publication of retractions and corrections
alternative remedy, including power to make an order in respect of the form,
content and placement of these. The matters the
Court may take into account in
mitigating damages should be specified.
The John Fairfax Group is opposed to the concept of court-ordered corrections
and retractions. However, prompt publication of court-approved
corrections and
apologies might be an alternative to damages. Court approval of the substance
and form of a proposed correction or
apology could be useful in circumstances
where: the complainant seeks a correction or apology that is completely
unacceptable to
the publisher; and the complainant refuses to accept or offer
of correction or apology and institutes an action for damages. There
strict time limits (say 7 days) on the procedure.
The Committee considers that the existing law should be significantly altered
to make the process of apology a real and attractive
Recommendation: The publisher of matter that is or may be defamatory of
another person may make to the person (the complainant) an
offer of amends
under this law. If an offer of amends is made under this law and the
complainant does not accept the offer, it is
a defence to proceedings by the
complainant against the publisher for damages for defamation that:
* the publisher made the offer as soon as practicable after becoming
aware that the matter is or may be defamatory of the complainant;
* the publisher is ready and willing to perform the offer on acceptance
by the complainant at any time before the start of the trial
on issues in
relation to the defence; and
* in all the circumstances, the offer (including the offer of money) is
reasonable.
In determining whether the offer is reasonable, the Committee
believes that regard should be had to any correction or apology published,
action taken, by the publisher or any other person at any time before the
occasion for determination arises.
Publication
At common law, liability for a publication arises from participation or authorisation.
Thus where defamatory matter is published, everyone who has taken part may face
action. In the case of a newspaper, the following
people may be sued: the journalist,
editor, printer, publisher and vendor. A limited defence does exist to protect
innocent distributors,
he/she did not know that the publication contained the defamation
complained of ; and
he/she did not know that the publication was of a character likely to
contain a defamation; and
such want of knowledge was not due to any negligence on his/her part.
The ALP (ACT Branch) argued that there is
room for a limited defence if the publisher did not know or could not be
expected to know
material may be defamatory, and that they took steps to remedy
any injury arising from any misunderstanding.
Justice Gallop, in the ACT Supreme Court decision of
Edward Cecil Thompson
v Australian Capital Television
ruled on the defence of innocent dissemination. The case involved the broadcast
of defamatory material on Capital 7, a television
station in the ACT. Capital
7 had taken an item on direct feed from Channel 9 in Sydney, and had no opportunity
the material or to edit it.
Justice Gallop stated "It is now settled law that a person who is not the
author, printer, or the first or main publisher of a work
that contains a
libel, but has only taken a subordinate part in disseminating it, eg. by
selling, distributing or handing to another
a copy of a newspaper or book in
which it appears, will not be liable if he succeeds in showings:
that he did not know that the book or paper contained the libel complained
that it did not know that the book or paper was of a character liable to
contain a libel; and
that such a want of knowledge was nor due to any negligence on his part."
The authority in the area of the defence of innocent dissemination has largely
been concerned with newspapers and books. Justice
Gallop noted that this was the
case and agreed with the opinion of Sally Walker
who stated that there seems no reason that the same principles should not apply
to material broadcast on radio and television.
Recommendation: There should be a defence of innocent publication. The
publication is "innocent" as regards the other person if, at
and before the
time of publication, the publisher and the publisher's employees and
* exercises reasonable care in relation to the matter and its
publication;
* does not intend the matter to be defamatory of the person;
* does not know and could not reasonably be expected to know the
circumstances because of which the matter is or may be defamatory
of that person.
from the Speaker's Corner
The Committee notes the institution of a `Speaker's Corner' in Glebe Park. The
Committee notes that in fact no specific protection
exists for a person
availing themselves of the supposed freedoms in using the `Speakers Corner'
(although any of the above defences
might apply in particular cases).
The Committee considers that there should be a specific defence for words
spoken at the `Speakers Corner'. The defence should not
extend to the use of
mechanical or electronic aids nor to the republication of the words spoken.
The lack of a specific defence might be thought to be a trivial matter and not
worthy of specific legal protection. The Committee
considers that it is an
initiative of considerable symbolic importance; it establishes a formal
recognition of the tension between
the ideal of unfettered freedom of speech
and the qualified freedom within the law. It feels that the lack of a defence
specifically remedied.
Recommendation: There should be a defence of words spoken from the
Speaker's Corner.
Damages for defamation are assessed in accordance with the common law rather
than in accordance with principles set out in any legislation.
The Australian Press Council proposed that damages should not be the principal
remedy except for proven economic loss. The Free Speech
Committee countered
that damages are not always an appropriate remedy - it results in a court
judgment that the audience to whom
the statement was made is not even aware it
does not restore reputation. The John Fairfax Group argued that damages are an
inappropriate
remedy unless economic loss can be proved. Damages should not be
awarded at all if an agreed upon or court-ordered correction or
published unless the plaintiff can show economic loss.
Professor Michael Chesterman noted that the vindication of reputation is the
remedy primarily desired by defamed persons (a court
ordered correction could
give defamed private citizens greater access to the highly concentrated media).
Others agreed that corrections
made immediately, accurately and prominently
would make a big difference. Some suggested that newspapers be required
automatically
and immediately to give prominent space to corrections and
complaints by persons who feel they have been defamed in the newspaper
to right of reply remedy). Professor Chesterman argued that a right of reply
should be available and may be a more appropriate
remedy in many cases,
particularly where dealing with defamatory comment. He noted that appropriate
alternative non-monetary remedies
would provide a middle way between often
heavy damages (plus costs) and no remedy at all and should be a potential
alternative to
damages, not just a factor in mitigation.
The Canberra Times argued that damages have gotten out of hand in NSW and
this could easily happen in Act.
The Canberra
Times suggested an indexed cap of $10,000 for pain, suffering and embarrassment,
and no limit for proven damage.
To the contrary, the AMA objected that capping
claims to $10,000 was not advisable, because financial damage, even if unrecoverable,
would exceed this amount many times over. Unless there is a large financial
penalty to act as a deterrent, the media will abuse
its privilege on a scale
unprecedented in this country. The Australian Press Council and the John Fairfax
Group proposed that
a cap should not be placed on damages for non-economic loss.
The Australian Society of Authors wanted a cap for damages for non-economic
The Law Society suggested that the law has taken the view that it is assumed
that a defamatory imputation has caused a loss in some
financial sense so
damages are appropriate. The level of damages awarded should not be dissimilar
to those in personal injuries cases.
The Law Society objected to the notion
that damages should be awarded only for proven monetary loss and opposed a cap
damages. Each case should be considered on its merits.
Professor Michael Chesterman said that some damages awards are "obscene" when
compared to those available for "pain and suffering"
in torts. Mr Ryan argued
that damages awards are not high enough, that the cost to a plaintiff, family
and friends may be much greater
that current damages awards can compensate for
(ie. they may involve selling family homes; massive loss in business; and
stress related
illnesses).
The Committee notes with approval that, in NSW, in determining the amount of
damages to be awarded in any successful defamation proceedings
a court is now
required to:
ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the
relevant harm and the amount of damages awarded; and
take into account the ordinary level of general damages component in
personal injury awards.
The Committee considers that evidence should be
admissible on behalf of the defendant, in mitigation of damages, that the
has already recovered damages;
has brought proceedings for damages; or
has received or agreed to receive compensation.
The Committee considers
that in assessing damages or awarding costs the court should take into account
whether or not:
a correction statement was sought or published and the promptness and
prominence with which the correction statement was published;
an offer of amends was made and the circumstances in which the offer of
amends was made.
Recommendation: Damages for defamation
are to be recoverable in accordance with the common law subject to the
following qualifications:
* a court is required to: ensure that there is an appropriate and
rational relationship between the relevant harm and the amount of
awarded; and take into account the ordinary level of general damages component
in personal injury awards in the ACT.
* evidence should be admissible on behalf of the defendant, in mitigation
of damages, that the plaintiff: has already recovered damages;
has brought
proceedings for damages; or has received or agreed to receive
compensation.
* the court should take into account whether or not: a correction
statement was sought or published and the promptness and prominence
the correction statement was published; or an offer of amends was made and the
circumstances in which the offer of amends
The Committee notes the recommendation in the United Kingdom Neill Report
recommending the removal of the right to claim exemplary
or punitive damages
in defamation cases.
The Neill Report argued
against retention of these heads of damage on the basis of analogy of such damages
with a criminal
law fine. The Australian Press Council and the John Fairfax
Group proposed that exemplary damages should be abolished.
The Committee does not support any practice whereby exemplary or punitive
damages are sought as a matter of course in defamation
cases. However, the majority
does not agree with the removal of these rights.
It considers that the above formulation and
cost penalties will discourage unmeritorious applications for this remedy.
A plaintiff in a civil action other than defamation is generally required to
prove damage. The Australian Society of Authors argued
that damages should be
assessed as for other damages. The Free Speech Committee recommended that
damages only be awarded for proven
monetary loss.
The Committee concedes the force of these arguments. However it notes that the
intangible nature of damage resulting from defamation.
Accordingly it believes
that the plaintiff should be relieved from the necessity of proving specific
damage in an action for defamation.
Recommendation: A plaintiff should not need to allege or prove specific
damage in an action for defamation.
Section 9 of the
Defamation Act 1901
discourages
unmeritorious applications by providing that an order for costs should not be
made where damages awarded are less than
$4 unless the Judge in any case of
libel certifies that the words charged as defamatory were published without
reasonable grounds
or excuse. Surprisingly, the Imperial Act
21 Jas. 1 c.
16, s 6 (1623)
provides that if damages are assessed at being under $10,
then the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action shall only recover so much
costs as the damages so given. Such provisions are an unnecessary burden on the
law of costs which already penalises frivolous process.
In previous
recommendations, the Committee has recommended the repeal of these rules.
In the ACT juries are allowed under the Supreme Court Rules, but, until recently,
a jury trial has not been ordered. Juries are
used in defamation cases in New
South Wales and are treated as '... holders of the public conscience and the preferred
adjudicators
of the facts'.
However, issues of public interest, privilege
and reasonable cause are decided by the judge. Juries also decide on the amount
damages. The perception is that juries will often award inappropriately large
amounts in damages, and that there is little consistency
in amounts from case
The ALP (ACT Branch) suggested that juries should not be introduced. The Law
Society submitted, with juries, the advantages of a
more accurate reflection of
community standards is outweighed by the prolongation of trials and associated
additional costs.
The Australian Society of Authors would like to see judges sitting alone for
reasons of shortening proceedings, lower costs, and
reliable precedents.
However, if juries were to be retained then juries should determine liability
and the judge the size of damages.
The John Fairfax Group argued that juries should determine liability. If
general damages are retained, the judge should determine
quantum with advice
from the jury as to whether damages should be actual or nominal, or whether any
mitigating or aggravating factors
The Committee notes that the proposed law will need to make provision for the
delineation of the particular functions of judge and
juries if juries are to be
retained as an option. The Committee makes no specific recommendations about
the role of the jury other
than to note the desirability of juries not being
involved in determining the quantum of damages and the desirability of
consistency
with NSW. In this respect the recommendations of the New South
Wales Law Reform Commission concerning juries are of particular interest.
Corrections
Corrections can come in many forms including retractions, apologies or replies.
A 'retraction' may be defined as a 'good faith publication
of facts, withdrawing
and repudiating the prior defamatory statement'.
If this is accompanied by some expression of contrition,
it is called an 'apology'. A 'reply' is the publication of the plaintiff's
A correction may be used to correct public misconceptions resulting from the
publication of untrue material.
The circumstances
where corrections are used by the media vary.
The Committee notes that newspapers often expressly
correct mistakes of fact. Mistakes seem to be less commonly admitted on radio
or television. Offers of reply, after someone has felt aggrieved by an article
published are reasonably common, and, in newspapers,
are commonly placed in
the 'Letters' page. Apologies for matters that are in dispute due to a divergence
of views between the
media outlet and the person mentioned are rarely offered,
unless there is a threat of legal action. Even if this is the case the
proprietor is often reluctant to correct as this may be seen as an admission
if matters do come to court. This means
that the effectiveness of corrections
is diminished in exactly the situation where litigation might have been avoided
correction been made.
The Committee thought it desirable to establish a more formal correction
process that overcome structural disincentives to publishing
the truth of a
matter. In doing so, the Committee does not belittle the practical difficulties
that might be encountered given that
the effectiveness of the correction would
depend on speed in reaching substantially the same audience as did the original
misstatement.
Where the defendant is not a publisher, seeking a similar
audience also presents difficulties.
The Committee considers that a person who proposes to take an action for
defamation should be placed under a positive obligation
to take steps to
protect their reputation.
Recommendation: A person who has a cause of action under the Defamation
Act shall, before commencing proceedings, require that the
person who published
the defamatory matter take appropriate steps to correct the defamatory matter
(if this has not already adequately
Where a person does not make a prompt correction statement in
accordance with the request, the complainant should be able to engage
person in a mandatory process focussing on the terms of a correction without
the need to commence defamation proceedings.
Recommendation:
Where a person refuses or inadequately complies with a request for a
correction, a person who has a cause of action under this Act
may apply to a
court for an order recommending that the person who published the defamatory
matter publish in the way, and at the
time or times, specified in the order, a
correction statement that:
* is in a form approved by the court or a mediator appointed by the
* relates to the matter on which the proceedings are or may be based;
* effects a correction of, or an apology for, the matter to which it
The effect of co-operation in the publishing of an effective
correction may well be seen in a diminution in commencement of defamation
actions. The Committee is aware of a number of cases where the plaintiff would
have been satisfied with a prompt retraction, apology
or opportunity for reply.
Similarly, the Committee is aware of a number of cases where the defendant was
anxious to give a prompt
retraction, apology or opportunity for reply.
Perversely, despite the best of intentions on the part of the parties, in some
cases an attempt to finalise the form of the correction failed. The
Committee considers that the formalisation and protection of
this process will
avoid such failures.
Recommendation: No inference of liability is to be drawn from the
publication of a correction statement.
It was suggested that a correction should exclude a subsequent
claim for damages if the correction was prominent, contrite and prompt
The Committee felt that there would be circumstances where even if these
criteria were met, a court should still consider
the issue of damages although
an effective correction would have a significant effect on the quantum of
damages (this issue is dealt
with under Damages at p.48). Without making a
specific recommendation to this effect, the Committee considered that a person
had received an adequate correction would also need to establish
negligence, reckless indifference or deliberate action on the part
person making the correction to receive damages as well.
The person who made the statement complained about may not be prepared to
publish the correction and may be content to see the matter
litigated. It would
be unconscionable to force a person to publish a correction against their will.
Recommendation: It should not be mandatory for a party or prospective
party to publish a correction statement.
of the Procedural Law of Defamation
This chapter focuses largely on reform issues which may arise during the
pre-trial period of a defamation action from the time the
writ is issued to the
beginning of the trial. This period can often be occupied by sterile and
expensive disputation on pleadings
and interlocutory skirmishes (arguments over
pleadings, particulars and discovery of documents which are usually heard by
the Registrar
or Master).
The Committee notes that the implementation of recommendations in this Chapter
may require amendments of the Rules of the Supreme
Court. The rule making power
of the Supreme Court is vested in the Judges of the Supreme Court.
Consequently, the recommendations in this Chapter
insofar as they require amendment to the Rules of Court are respectfully addressed
to the Supreme Court.
Many written and oral submissions to the Committee confidently asserted
features and trends about ACT defamation cases on the basis
anecdotal observations. For example, many people, including those familiar with
defamation practice in the ACT, confidently
asserted that defamation
proceedings are only used by the very wealthy, that most proceedings are
against newspapers, that the ACT
is the most popular forum for defamation
actions and that most defamation proceedings result in windfall damages.
Ultimately, each of these assertions has proved to be mistaken.
It has only been through painstaking empirical research that the Committee has
been able to pierce the myths that surround defamation
proceedings.
The Committee initiated a detailed study of the law concerning procedural steps
applicable to defamation proceedings. As part of
this study the Committee undertook
a study of the 1130 procedural steps taken in 133 defamation proceedings initiated
Supreme Court from 1985 to 1988.
In conducting the study, the Committee has been greatly assisted by the interest
and comments of practitioners, court officials
and the judiciary. The findings
of the study suggest a number of changes need to be made to pre-trial processes
in the ACT.
The support given the Committee
and recent concerted moves to update and improve pre-trial processes auger well
in this area.
The Committee's study showed that, over the period studied:
thirty to forty defamation actions were commenced in the ACT each year;
only a small percentage of actions actually proceeded to trial and less
than one quarter of all actions ever came before a judicial
officer for any
one quarter of actions examined did not progress beyond issue of a writ
or the appearance of the defendant;
very few actions conformed to time deadlines imposed by the Supreme Court
Rules for the completion of procedural steps;
the majority of defendants are not newspapers;
the majority of plaintiffs were neither recognisably prominent persons nor
politicians;
defamation actions can take a long time to get through the pre-trial process.
One third of all actions examined were still 'live'
after three years (procedural
steps were still being taken). One quarter of all actions examined were still
'live' in this
sense after four years. A number of cases were live after five
years (about 10% of cases);
defamation cases tend to get bogged down in interlocutory skirmishes.
It has been suggested that plaintiffs are forced into long , costly
and stressful
battles simply because many media organisations
arguments are mounted on behalf of defendants.
In its submission, the Law Society argued that the best way to improve the
procedure was to simplify the law of defamation. Surprisingly,
suggested that if this was done then it would be unnecessary to amend
procedural rules. The Committee agrees that sensible
reform of the substantive
rules of defamation law may have a beneficial effect on procedure. However, on
the basis of its research,
it does not agree that procedural rules can be left
as they presently are. Indeed, the Committee strongly believes that procedural
reform is necessary in meeting the associated problems of delay and expense in
defamation process.
For some time there has been greater judicial emphasis on the importance of
preparatory steps in coming to trial. In 1970, Justice
Russell Fox argued that:
It is of particular importance that the parties understand clearly
and with precision what is being alleged by each other and what
the issues for
trial are. It is also important that they take full advantage of interlocutory
processes which will enable them
to save time at the trial, as by obtaining
admissions. These results are most likely to be achieved, and to be achieved
minimum expense and delay, if the parties have ready access to the Court,
and freely obtain its directions.
Sadly, the advantages foreseen by Mr Justice Fox have been largely overtaken by
increased pressure on the availability of judicial
time. Some of the issues identified
in this chapter might be addressed through the introduction of an expedited list
In Western Australia, civil
cases (including defamation cases) are now coming on for trial 3-4 months after
issue of the writ.
However, such a system requires adequate judicial time to deal
properly with these matters and maintain the pressure on both parties.
Committee's opinion, adoption of this model would require the appointment of an
additional resident judge to the Supreme
Court (imposing costs on the general
community) or reliance on arbitration (imposing cost on the parties themselves).
In the past, Courts have rarely intervened to progress an action on their
own motion. However, in the Committee's view, it is
clear that Courts must take
a firmer role in the case management of this class of actions to ensure that
matters are brought
to trial at the earliest possible moment. Firmer judicial
intervention at a very early stage in the judicial proceedings will
defamation proceedings and reduce costs. Intervention would help the parties
concentrate their minds at a much earlier
stage on the issues for decision,
minimising the prospect of untenable defences being maintained up to and including
It may also reduce the list of plaintiffs who are not really serious
essential element
in recent moves to implement better case flow management in other Australian
The Fox model also rested on the assumption that parties have a shared interest
in preparing for trial. The casual observer might
mistakenly believe that the
existing rules provide a sufficiently rigorous timetable for the completion of
all necessary pre-trial
steps. However, the present rules are based on
self-help and much depends on the cooperation of the parties in bringing a
to conclusion. Evidence before the Committee suggested parties often do
not have a shared interest in preparing for trial. At one
extreme are parties
who attempt to delay the proceedings for collateral advantages (such as
restriction on the public debate of the
question at issue) while at the other
extreme are those who cannot proceed immediately (because of more pressing
business reasons
or financial incapacity). In some cases, the elusive search
for certainty can become a paper war with expensive interlocutory processes
serving no better purpose than to distract or wear down the other side.
Examination of a number of defamation cases suggest that, at least in the early
stages of the interlocutory process, information
sought by the plaintiff or the
defendant varies very little. Notwithstanding this and strict timetables set by
the Supreme Court
Rules, there are often lengthy delays in seeking or providing
basic information. Delays are sometimes explained by the need to clear
for information or responses with counsel. However, these delays are not
justified in the public interest; delay frustrates
the proper administration of
justice and has brought the operation of the law into disrepute.
The pre-trial period should not be a period devoted to the pursuit of tactical
advantage. The Committee believes that if one's name
is to be cleared then the
sooner that is done after the defamation, the better. There is always a certain
unreality about having
an action three or four years after the event when
everyone has virtually forgotten about the original defamatory allegations.
disappear or their memories become hazy.
In making recommendations in this area, the Committee has had regard to the
following principles:
it is essential that any damage to reputation is vindicated at the earliest
possible moment;
actions should be heard in the climate in which the defamatory statements
were made and not, as is sometimes the case, many years
access to justice should not be frustrated by technical procedures; and
improvements need to be made so that defamation litigation is less
time-consuming and less expensive.
Reform aims in this area are:
to ensure the timely resolution of disputes relating to pleadings and
interlocutory proceedings generally;
to ensure that the onus of proof where truth is pleaded falls on the
appropriate party; and
to stop the inappropriate use of the sub-judice rule.
Significant
injustices may arise during the pre-trial period. For example:
the free flow of information within the community can be stopped, or, at
least severely restricted, sometimes with unfortunate
and harmful effects.
a party's resolve or financial capacity to see the case through to its
final conclusion can be "worn down". This tactic may win the
case for his or
her opponent without consideration of the substantive issues
Proceedings taken during this period may become a very expensive
element in the overall cost of taking or defending a defamation action.
pre-trial period should serve as a period during which:
the issues to be put to and decided by a Court are crystallised; and
where appropriate, any loss unjustly suffered by the plaintiff is minimised
through the joint efforts of plaintiff and defendant.
existing procedural law
To understand how the procedural law works, it is necessary to closely examine
closely the existing procedural rules. Because defamation
proceedings can be
initiated in the Supreme Court, the Magistrates Court and the Small Claims
Court, the Committee considered the
procedural rules in each jurisdiction.
However, because detailed empirical information is only available for the
Supreme Court and
because most actions are commenced in that Court, the
Committee concentrated on that jurisdiction.
In order to make changes, it is important to understand the complexities of the
system. Accordingly, the Committee makes no apology
for the technical nature of
the following discussion.
In the Supreme Court, procedural law in defamation actions is a very
specialised area; during the process, litigants and practitioners
are presented
with numerous pitfalls and tactical options. While some of these issues are
faced in other types of action, there are
a number of highly complex issues
unique to this area of law. This is an area of considerable change: recent
practice directions
concerning this area and the revision of the rules
themselves have addressed some of the issues of concern identified in the
Committee's
In the course of preparing a case for court, a defamation action passes through
a number of distinct phases from the writ of summons
(formal commencement of
action) to certificate of readiness (conclusion of preparatory steps). The
following list indicates the stages
which might be encountered in a defamation
action in the ACT.

Certificate of Readiness
Defamation cases commence by Writ of Summons.
A Writ of Summons is issued by the plaintiff.
It commands the defendant to answer the action.
From 1985 to 1988, about 160 defamation writs were issued.
Information
included in the Writ of Summons
A Writ of Summons must include information about the nature of the claim and the
relief or remedy sought.
It must identify
the publications in respect of which the action is brought.
However, it is unnecessary to set forth the
precise ground of complaint or the precise remedy or relief sought.
In most other types of action commenced before the Supreme Court, the plaintiff
may include with the Writ of Summons additional information
concerning the
action. This is normally done in a formal document entitled a Statement of
Claim although it can also be included
within the Writ of Summons. It other
early stage, this
generally speeds the ultimate disposition of a case.
However, actions for libel and slander are specifically excluded from this
beneficial process.
In a defamation case,
the plaintiff is required to provide this additional information only after
the defendant enters his
or her appearance.
In reality the Writ of Summons in a defamation case gives little information
have to face. With no information
other than the Writ of Summons, the defendant will have very little information
nature of the claim. A defendant may be left to guess about the complaint
of the plaintiff although there may have been some more
informative pre-action
correspondence (letters of demand). This can cause hardship when the defamatory
imputation arises by
inference or mistake.
Without more information, the defendant may
not be in a position to take steps to remedy any loss or damage occasioned to
The Committee believes that it may be possible to save time and money by
simplifying the initial interrogatory stages and ensuring
that parties focus on
the real issues in the case at an early stage. Under the present rules it is
possible for an aggrieved person
to issue a writ of summons very quickly at
little cost. However the writ itself gives very little indication of the nature
case the defendant has to meet.
Recommendation: Order 4 rule 5 should be repealed.
The Writ of Summons must specify a time in which the defendant must enter his
or her appearance. Save in exceptional circumstances,
this is 8 days.
Many appearances seemed to exceed this time limit. Indeed, the average time to
enter an appearance was 26 days after filing the writ.
Where the defendant does not enter an appearance, the action may proceed as
if the defendant had entered an appearance.
Recommendation: The time limit for entering an appearance should be
revised and strictly enforced.
In defamation cases, a Statement of Claim must be provided to the defendant
within 14 days of the defendant entering his or her appearance.
deliver the statement of claim within 14 days enables a defendant to apply to a
Court to dismiss the action for want of
prosecution.
However, only 12 of the 90 statements of claim complied with the time
deadlines. 61 of the 90 statements of claim examined were issued
after 14 days.
17 of the 90 statements of claim were issued before the permitted date (some
with the Writ). The average time to issue
a statement of claim (excluding
statements of claim issued by mistake) was 78 days.
The Committee believes that certain material should be provided to the
defendant at the time the action commences. The plaintiff
should set out
matters necessary for the efficient disposition of the case including: facts
giving rise to identification; facts
founding a true innuendo; and, where the
offending publication is a newspaper, details of distribution of the newspaper
then known).
The Committee considers that allegations in the Statement of Claim should be
kept as simple as possible. It should be open to a plaintiff
particulars of the imputations on which he or she relies by letter rather than
plead them formally. This has the advantage
of flexibility and means that the
drafting of the Statement of Claim will not be unduly delayed.
Recommendation: Comprehensive information concerning an action should be
provided to the defendant with the Writ of Summons.
If the plaintiff does not deliver the statement of claim within
the time allowed for that purpose, the defendant may apply to the
Court to dismiss
the action with costs, for want of prosecution.
If no statement of claim has been delivered,
then on the hearing of such application the Court may order the action to be
or may make such other order as seems just.
The threat of dismissal is generally an empty threat. It does not constitute
a bar to recommencement of the action or of a subsequent
interlocutory motion
to set aside the dismissal. An action dismissed in this manner could be immediately
recommenced (unless
statute barred).
It would be unusual for a dismissal order to
be made, if the plaintiff was making genuine efforts to proceed.
A defendant may also move to strike out a statement of claim under Order 24
rule 4 on the basis that the statement and particulars
disclose no reasonable
cause of action. The Courts are reluctant to take such a step.
General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner
for Railways
Chief Justice Barwick
explained this reluctance:
...the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to the customary
tribunal which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his
cause of action - if that be the ground on which the court is invited, as in
this case, to exercise its powers of summary
dismissal - is clearly
demonstrated. The test to be applied has been variously expressed; 'so
obviously untenable that it cannot
possibly succeed'; 'manifestly groundless';
'so manifestly faulty that it does not admit of argument'; 'discloses a case
Court is satisfied cannot succeed'; 'under no possibility can there
be a good cause of action'; 'be manifest that to allow them'
(the pleadings)
'to stand would involve useless expense'.
Alternatively, the defendant may seek further and better particulars of the statement
Defendants are entitled to particulars of the
defamatory imputations or innuendoes relied upon by the plaintiff. They should
expressly related to publications (where more than one publication is being
complained of or parts of the publication where appropriate).
Where innuendoes
are provided by particulars, they will supersede innuendoes, if any, set out in
the statement of claim.
The defendant may, within 10 days of entering an appearance (or later by leave
of the Court), apply for summary judgment on the basis
that the action is
frivolous or vexatious, that the defendant has a good defence or that the
action should be disposed of summarily.
Order 17 provides that any defendant to
an action may, within ten days after appearance, or at any later time by leave
of the Court,
apply for summary judgment. If the Judge is satisfied that the
action is frivolous or vexatious, that the defendant has a good defence
merits, or that the action should be disposed of summarily or without
pleadings, the Judge: may order that judgment be entered
for the defendant with
or without costs; may order that the plaintiff shall proceed to trial without
pleadings; or if all parties
consent, may dispose of the action finally, and
without appeal, in a summary manner.
A defence is to be entered within 14 days of the date of the appearance or
statement of claim. A properly framed defence can help
identify the issues in
contention between the parties. Where the Court or Judge is of the opinion that
any allegations of fact denied
or not admitted by the defence ought to have
been admitted, the Court or Judge may make such order as is just with respect
extra costs occasioned by their having been denied or not admitted.
Of the 79 defences examined, only 2 defences were within the 14 days allowed.
The average time to issue a defence was 255 days.
Recommendation: The time limit for entering a defence should be revised
and strictly enforced.
In theory, the failure to enter a defence can significantly
prejudice the defendant's case. If a defendant fails to deliver a defence,
plaintiff may set down the action for default judgment.
However, in practice, default judgments can
be set aside.
Hewitt v Mirror Newspapers
Ltd and Another
, Justice Connor set
aside an interlocutory judgment, saying:
Despite the magnitude of this delay which has almost certainly
caused the plaintiff and his legal advisers extreme inconvenience,
think it has caused any harm to the plaintiff which the law in this context
regards as irreparable. If the interlocutory
judgment remains, the defendant
will be prevented from putting its defence before the
The Courts are reluctant to strike out actions.
Comalco Ltd v Australian Broadcast Commission
Justice Northrop considered such an application. He referred to the general principles
General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)
but was unable to form the necessary clear conclusion
that the pleadings attacked disclose no reasonable answer even though there
been full and substantial argument before him.
A plaintiff may also move to strike out a defence on the basis that it does
not disclose a reasonable answer to the claim.
However, in
Combe v Santamaria
Beaumont noted that the defendant needs only to give limited particulars of
a plea of qualified privilege and may
rely on other matters particularised but
which appear at the trial.
The lack of pleadings can be fatal to raising defences at the time of trial.
Order 38 rule 13 provides that where there are no
pleadings or issues, the defendant
shall not, except by leave of the Court or Judge, be allowed to rely on a set-off
or a counter-claim,
or on the defence of infancy, coverture (ie, marriage),
fraud, illegality, truth (in an action of defamation) or facts in mitigation
of damages in such action, defence on equitable grounds, statutory limitation
of actions, or discharge under any law relating
to bankruptcy or the winding
up of companies, unless he has given, within twenty days after appearance, notice
to the plaintiff
stating the grounds and the particulars upon which he relies.
A copy of any such notice shall be filed by the plaintiff for the
Judge at the trial.
A reply is to be delivered within 7 days of the defence.
It is not necessary for a party to file or deliver
a reply that is merely a joinder of issues.
However, all 47 replies examined were issued after 7 days. The average time
to issue a reply was 193 days.
Recommendation: The time limit for entering a reply should be revised
and strictly enforced.
In some cases parties may seek discovery through interrogatories.
Interrogatories may be made on a number of subjects,
including the size of circulation of a paper within a jurisdiction.
A party may also apply to the Court for
directions.
Pleadings may close at the end of any of the above stages.
Time-limits specified in the rules may be varied by consent of the parties.
Order 64 rule 6 provides that the time for delivering,
amending, or filing any
pleading or document may be enlarged by consent in writing, without application
to the Court or Judge.
The revised process proposed by the Committee must be set within a strict
framework which cannot be abridged by the parties alone
and which discourages
non-compliance. The right to demand additional information should not be the
prerogative of either party: the
need for further or better particulars should
be established at a directions hearing before a Judge or the Master. Because of
weaknesses in the existing rules, this scheme may need in part a
legislative basis.
If a party repeatedly fails to comply with time limits there must be a
readiness on the part of the Court to penalise the party (such
as the awarding
of costs on a solicitor/client basis against a defaulting party). Parties and
their legal representatives should
be subjected to a much higher degree of
preparation and discipline. There may also be the prospect of orders for costs
against practitioners
personally for delay or incompetence.
It may be appropriate for the Court to initiate an automatic directions
hearing. When the matter comes before the Master or Judge
for directions a
strict timetable should be imposed for the completion of all further
interlocutory steps. In particular, the need
for interrogatories should be
established instead of it being an automatic entitlement. The party should be
obliged to come back
before the same Master or Judge in 28 days to keep the
matter under review.
Recommendation: Order 64 rule 6 should cease to apply in defamation
cases. Time should only be capable of being enlarged by order
of the Court.
Alternative
Dispute Resolution
One of the continuing complaints is that of court delay in the resolution of defamation
actions. This has prompted suggestions that
in some circumstances it may be desirable
to seek a resolution of such disputes outside the court system by means of arbitration
or mediation. The Report of the Legislation Committee of the NSW Parliament on
the Uniform Defamation Bill
was generally supportive of alternative dispute
resolution, particularly mediation.
Arbitration of defamation cases was generally considered unworkable because
setting up a separate arbitration tribunal would duplicate
the adversarial
system already in place and also duplicate the cost.
Mediation, on the other hand would appear to be a more positive alternative.
A questions arises as to whether the mediation should
be a function of the court,
or whether it should be performed by a body independent of the court. One suggestion
made to the
New South Wales Law Reform Commission was to use the Australian
Press council in this role.
The Press Council
at present deals with complaints from the public concerning editorial and article
content of the print media.
Complaints are first directed to the editor of the
publication concerned and if there is no resolution then the complaint is referred
to the Council for adjudication. Other suggestions were for a panel of mediators
independent of the courts and the Press Council.
Courts in other jurisdictions sometimes come under enormous pressure due to the
number of cases pending. There is no provision to
refer matters to mediation so
as to relieve the pressure. The ACT Court system is in a much better position.
The case load is not
as heavy as in other jurisdictions and new case management
procedures have been recently introduced to facilitate the more efficient
of cases through the courts.
Recommendation: The Committee is in favour of mediation. Defamation
matters should be dealt with as part of the new case management
already in place within the ACT court system (note that this system also
imposes `tailor made' time limits.).
The current limitation period for defamation actions is six years. This time
runs from the date of publication of the matter complained
period is seen as far too long. It is logical
to assume that the defamatory
material would have come to the notice of the potential plaintiff long before
this period has elapsed.
The Canberra Times suggested six months from date of publication. It argued
that the present six years is to long to require defendants
to keep records and
tabs on witnesses. The ALP (ACT Branch) suggested two year limit from time of
publication. The Australian Press
Council supported 6 months from when
plaintiff first learns of the publication with an absolute limit of 3 years.
The Australian
Society of Authors argued for a 6-month limitation period for
reasons including the "potential jeopardy to reprints and paperback
It viewed the current 6 year period as inappropriate for the timely restoration
of a person's reputation. The Free Speech
Committee pointed out that the
current 6 year limitation period allows plaintiffs to commence actions well
after the time in which
it is realistic to restore their reputation. The Free
Speech Committee recommended that the limitation of the time in which a person
whose reputation has been attacked to 3 months after the publication. The John
Fairfax Group supported a limitation period of 6 months
from when the plaintiff
first learned of the publication with an absolute limit of 3 years. A permanent
stay of proceedings should
be applied where a plaintiff takes no action for a
period of 12 months.
The Committee agreed that the limitation on commencement of defamation actions
should be six months from the date of discovery of
publication, with a capacity
to extend to three years with leave of the court.
Recommendation: A defamation action should be not maintainable after the
expiry of the period of 6 months immediately following the
publication, or with
the leave of the Court, a period of not more than 3 years immediately following
the publication.
In addition to civil consequences for the publication of a defamatory matter,
such conduct may also be a crime punishable by fine
or imprisonment.
English Courts developed criminal libel to prevent breach of the peace that
might arise in response to verbal assaults upon honour
or reputations. The
original split between criminal slander and criminal libel can still be seen in
different provisions in the law.
Criminal slander is dealt with in the
Crimes Act 1900
. Section 547(2) of
Crimes Act 1900
provides that where a defendant has spoken any
offensive or defamatory words and this gives rise to the possibility of a
the peace, the defendant may be required to enter into a undertaking
to keep the peace.
Criminal libel is dealt with in the
Crimes Act 1900
. Part 3 of the
Defamation Act 1901
makes provision for three offences: malicious
publication of false defamatory libel, malicious publication of defamatory
libel with intent to extort money.
In practice, very few criminal defamation proceedings have occurred in recent
Recent United Kingdom cases and reports
similarly lend little support for the retention of the law.
The ALP (ACT Branch) suggested its abolition.
The Committee considers the existing law to be archaic. The Committee has
previously recommended the repeal of the
Defamation Act 1901
considers that the
Crimes Act 1900
should be amended to remove the reference to
defamatory words.
Recommendation: Section 547(2) of the
Crimes Act 1900
should be amended
to delete the words "or defamatory". A consequential change is necessary in
relation to the title of the subsection.
The Committee notes, without making a
recommendation, that consideration might be given to the repeal of subsection
547(2) and (3).
It has been put to the Committee that it is unnecessary to retain
criminal offences concerning defamatory conduct. It was argued
that such provisions
are not suited to modern circumstances.
The Australian Society of Authors and the Free Speech Committee recommended
that criminal defamation should be abolished as being
anachronistic.
The John Fairfax Group argued that criminal defamation should be abolished. If
the offence is retained, then the DPP should have
sole discretion as to its
use. Similarly the Australian Press Council supported abolition of criminal
defamation. If this is not
possible, then the Attorney-General's consent should
be required before prosecution.
Mr Bruce Connell argued that criminal libel should be retained for those rare
cases where one individual deliberately sets out seriously
to injure another by
means of libel. He thought that prosecutions should be handled by an
independent body such as DPP(free from
the executive arm of government). There
is the situation where a person with no means repeatedly and wantonly defames
various individuals
and those cases where, by reason of their position in
office, a person would not be expected to take action personally by way of
civil proceedings.
With some reluctance, the majority of Committee cannot agree with the suggestion
to abolish the offence.
The Committee notes
that a number of subterfuges have been used to avoid civil liability for defamatory
conduct. Ultimately,
a criminal sanction is the only real sanction against someone
who has made themselves an uneconomic civil target or who defames
a person or
body that cannot be expected to take a civil action.
Recommendation: The ACT should retain a criminal offence of
defamation.
However, the Committee considers that proceedings for an offence
should only be started with the written consent of the Director
of Public Prosecutions
and within 6 months of the offence being allegedly committed. In considering
whether the grant consent,
the Director should have regard to Australian treaty
obligations.
Recommendation: Proceedings for an offence should only be started with
the written consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions
and within 6 months
of the alleged offence.
Section 23 of the
Defamation Act 1901
permits damages to
be exacted against types, presses or printing materials of the person who
publishes the defamation. It is unnecessary
to preserve this provision.

AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT
Mr Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to:
advise members of recent advances in the effort to bring about uniform
defamation law in Australia; and
table revised terms of reference to the Community Law Reform Committee
concerning defamation law reform.
The Eastern States Exercise
It has been long accepted that defamation does not stop at State or
Territory borders; what happens in one State or Territory has
an inevitable
impact in other jurisdictions.
We can all see some of the undesirable interstate ramifications of defamation
in the over-burdened lists of our courts. Many litigants
commence actions in
the ACT simply because of the perception that the ACT provides particular
advantages to plaintiffs. The most
tenuous connection is sometimes used to
found an action in the ACT rather than the place where a paper or broadcast was
What exacerbates the problem in the ACT is not that we have particularly
objectionable defamation laws but that our present law is
different from the
other States and draws litigants like a magnet. Recently, the ACT Law Society
has recommended that the ACT reconsider
the moves being made towards uniformity
by the Eastern States.
At the June 1990 Alice Springs meeting of the Standing Committee of
Attorneys-General, Ministers agreed that the question of uniform
laws should be re-opened. This exercise has been coordinated directly by the
Attorneys-General of NSW, Victoria and Queensland.
At meetings of the Standing
Committee of Attorneys-General and at various other times, they have reported
publicly on their progress.
To date, the New South Wales, Victorian and
Queensland Attorneys-General have issued a number of joint discussion papers on
of defamation law. The exercise has made significant progress
towards establishing a single simple defence of justification, shorter
limitation periods, court-recommended corrections, protections for innocent
publication and other measures to encourage media responsibility.
Just recently, the Eastern States' exercise has picked up momentum and appears
to have some chance of success in developing a uniform
law. I do not think we
should ignore this window of opportunity for closer ACT involvement.
Community Law Reform Committee
Members will be interested to know that the Eastern States' proposals
are not dissimilar to those developed by our Community Law Reform
which is also considering the issue of defamation law reform. I have discussed
the possibility of moving closer to the
Eastern States exercise with the
Chairperson of the Community Law Reform Committee, Mr Kelly.
Mr Kelly, has advised me that the Committee has come to the view that, whilst
all the details of the Eastern States proposal have
not been clarified, the ACT
would be well served by becoming more involved with the Eastern States
exercise. He has also advised
me that the effort of the Committee was already
directed to areas of reform in the defamation area not affected by the Eastern
exercise: namely consideration of procedural reform and consideration of
a new tort of privacy.
The Committee is considering a model privacy law which provides for a
complete tort of privacy - an action that would be similar to
but separate to a
defamation action. At present, the Eastern States' proposal only provides
protection for publication of private
facts where a person is also defamed.
Recently I had pleasure in providing an advance copy of the Committee's paper
on privacy to
the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I believe that we
will get some fairly positive feedback from the other States and Territories
once they have a chance to consider our Committee's proposal for reform in this
Procedural Reform
The Committee is also examining closely reform of the procedural law.
It is procedural difficulties which often cause lengthy delays and high costs
in defamation proceedings. The Committee has held a
public seminar on
procedural reform and received favourable comment on its proposals. The
Committee will be releasing a discussion
paper on procedural reform in the near
future which will be circulated to all jurisdictions for comment.
Closer Relations with the Eastern States
Following discussions with the Attorneys-General from the Eastern States
and our Community Law Reform Committee, I think the time
is right for the ACT
to move closer to the Eastern States exercise and I have signalled our
intention to do this.
I will advise members of the detail of the Eastern States proposals after the
next round of discussions.
I hasten to add that the Community Law Reform Committee will continue to be
actively involved in the reform of defamation law in
the area of procedural
reform and the development of a new tort of privacy for the ACT.
To this end I have revised the Committee's terms of reference and I table it
for the information of members.

"A": Uniformity
Both the original reference issued by former Attorney General Bernard Collaery
as modified by former Attorney General Terry Connolly,
refer to a uniform
defamation law proposed by the Eastern States. The desire, will and spirit to
achieve uniform defamation laws
has been difficult to put into effect.
For more than 150 years there have been a number of attempts to secure uniformity
between the states. The most recent attempts can
be traced back to 1976 and the
then Commonwealth Attorney-General, R. J. Ellicott, QC, who gave a reference to
the Australian Law
Reform Commission to report on desirable changes to the existing
law, practice and procedure relating to defamation. The Commission's
Unfair Publication: Defamation and Privacy
was released in 1979. It contained
recommendations for reform and explored options for achieving uniformity.
It also canvassed aspects of invasion of privacy caused by publication.
The Standing Committee of Attorneys General (SCAG) attempted to progress the
goal of uniform defamation laws in 1980. The Standing
Committee received a
number of submissions and in 1983 and 1984 released draft legislation for
public comment. The legislation failed
to receive widespread support and in
1985 defamation law reform was removed from SCAG's agenda.
The reason that the uniform exercise faltered was disagreement among the States
in the areas of the defence of justification and
the definition of a defamatory
matter. In its first report in 1988, the Constitutional Commission recommended
Constitution
should be altered to confer power on the Commonwealth with
respect to defamation.
This proposal has likewise
been rejected.
In 1990 SCAG agreed that the question of uniform defamation laws should be re-opened.
There was a resurgence of interest amongst
the eastern States of Queensland, Victoria
and New South Wales. The ACT Alliance Government, while encouraging this move,
join the Eastern States exercise.
The Eastern States worked on a joint Discussion
paper which was released in August 1990. A second paper was released in January
1991. Once again there was great interest generated and many submissions were
received. A Labor Government came to power in the
ACT in 1991 and the new Attorney
General, Terry Connolly, expressed a desire to join the Eastern States in promoting
uniformity.
Uniform Defamation Bills (based largely on the existing NSW
) were introduced into the Parliaments of Queensland, Victoria and New
South Wales in late 1991. A similar Bill was tabled by the
Attorney General in
the ACT Assembly in November, 1991.
Just when it seemed that uniformity was about to be achieved, the strategic
alliance between the Attorneys collapsed. The Queensland
Bill lapsed when the
Parliament was prorogued in early 1992. Following State election, the new
Victorian Government indicated that
it would not pursue uniformity as a
priority. The NSW Bill was referred to the NSWLRC for that body to undertake
empirical research
into defamation practice.
In an effort to secure some elements of uniformity between their jurisdictions,
the ACT Community Law Reform Committee met with the
NSWLRC on a number of
occasions with a view to preparing a joint report. However, it has become clear
that there could not be agreement
on a number of matters of importance.
"B": Other Developments
The reader's attention is drawn to several challenging proposals for reform,
particularly the recent report of the New South Wales
Law Reform Commission.
Developments in the United Kingdom continue to have relevance in the ACT.
Recently, Sir Leonard Hoffmann prepared a draft Defamation
Bill and an
explanatory paper. The main purpose of the bill (which had some similarities
with the Right of Reply Bill introduced
in the Commons in 1989) was to provide
for summary relief in certain defamation cases:
it permitted immediate corrections and small sums of money by way of
compensation;
it permitted defendants to dispose quickly of trivial cases;
it encouraged early settlements.
The Hoffmann draft Bill was criticised
in a 1991 report commissioned by the Lord Chancellor and undertaken by the
United Kingdom Supreme
Court Procedure Committee (chaired by Lord Justice
Neill). The recommendations of the Report deal with practice and procedure in
Defamation. Some of the recommendations in the Neill Report deal with issues
that have no relevance to the ACT. Others issues dealt
with in the Neill Report
have been considered by the Committee and either supported or rejected. A
number of the changes in the Neill
Report have already been put into effect as
changes to the Supreme Court Rules. In September 1994, the New Law Journal
reported that:
"Significant procedural changes affecting defamation actions
have recently been introduced ... [and] came into force on September
The changes implement some of the recommendations of Lord Justice Neill's
Working Group whose Report on Practice and Procedure
in Defamation was
published in July 1991. They are likely to have a considerable impact on the
conduct of libel litigation."
Late in 1994, following the
abandonment of proposed United Kingdom privacy laws, the Lord Chancellor
indicated that a Government Bill
to reduce the cost and delay in lawsuits would
be published. Proposed features of the legislation (an amalgam of both Neill
and Hoffmann
recommendations) are:
inclusion of a fast-track system for cases where moderate damages and a
correction would be sufficient remedy (complainants would
be able to go to a
High Court judge to seek an order requiring that the record be set straight and
damages be awarded up to a fixed
ceiling of several thousand pounds);
defendants will be able to halt cases when they recognise a plaintiff has
been libelled.
damages would also be determined by a judge.
judges will be able to rule before trials whether the words complained
the three-year time limit for starting an action for defamation would be
reduced to one year.
a new defence of innocent dissemination.
The Lord Chancellor's proposal
has come under fire from some United Kingdom defamation lawyers who argue that
under the fast-track
system judges will not properly assess damages as they
will not have had the opportunity to hear all the evidence.
Defamation Bill
The attached Bill has been prepared by the Community Law Reform
Committee. The Committee notes that the Bill, before being introduced
Assembly, should be prepared in final form by the Parliamentary Counsel. The
Committee has prepared this Bill, which is
similar in form and content to
legislation prepared as part of the Eastern States uniform exercise, to assist
practitioners and others
interested in visualising the proposed legislation.

faith, good faith shall be presumed and the onus of establishing
that the act
was not done in good faith lies with the plaintiff who must establish that the
act was done in disregard for the truth
either deliberate or reckless.
A relevant factor in deciding whether matter
was published
in good faith is whether any of the involved persons, when requested to do so
by the person whom it may defame, was

There is a defence as to any matter complained of, if the
publication was made in good faith and the defendant establishes that the
publication related to a matter of public interest and was made after
appropriate inquiries.
A relevant factor in deciding whether matter

an opportunity to confirm or deny the
truth of any statement made in the matter (unless such a course would have been
inappropriate).
If the court decides that a defence is made out, and it decides
that the statement is false, it may order the defendant to publish

qualified privilege and the manner of publication was reasonable in the
circumstances.
publication
(a) a person makes a multiple publication; and
(b) the matter published would if published to one or more, but not all, of
the recipients be published on an occasion of qualified

for the publication to that recipient
or those recipients, even though the
publication is not made on an occasion of qualified privilege as regards any
other recipient.
However, if the extent of publication is reasonable having regard
to the matter published and the occasion of qualified privilege,
defence of qualified privilege as regards all the recipients.
In this section, a matter is published on an occasion of qualified
privilege if the matter is published in and relevant to circumstances
attracting the defence of qualified privilege under this Part.
In this section, "multiple publication" means the publication of
the same or like matter or of copies of any matter to two or more
recipients:
(a) at the same time; or
(b) by means of the publication or in the ordinary course of affairs of
numerous copies of a newspaper or other writing; or
(c) otherwise in the course of one transaction;
There is a defence for a publication, if:

that character.
Information
There is a defence for a publication, if in respect of the
matter published:
(a) the recipient has an interest or apparent interest in having information
on some subject; and
(b) the matter is published to the recipient in the course of giving to the
recipient information on that subject; and
(c) the conduct of the publisher in publishing that matter is reasonable in
the circumstances.
A person has an apparent interest in having information on some
subject only if, at the time of the publication in question, the publisher
believes on reasonable grounds that the person has that interest.
If matter is published for reward in circumstances in which there
would be a qualified privilege under subsection (l) for the publication
were not for reward, there is a defence of qualified privilege for that
publication even though it is for reward.
6 - Protected reports and official and public documents
There is a defence for the publication in good faith of a report of
proceedings of a kind specified in Schedule 1 or a copy of such
a document or
an extract or abstract from, or summary of, such a document.

notice or report in accordance with an official request.
If there is an official request that a notice or report be
published to the public generally or a section of the public, and the
report is or relates to a matter of public interest, there is a defence for a

specified in Section 12 or Schedules 1 or 2;
(b) at the time when the comment was made, the comment represented the
defendant's opinion; and
(c) the comment relates to a matter of public interest.
of comment of an employee or agent of the defendant

may be the basis of comment imputing a dishonourable motive or
governing the
degree of foundation or justification that comment imputing a dishonourable
motive must have in the material on which
the comment is based.
9 - Defence of unlikelihood of harm
of unlikelihood of harm
It is a defence that the circumstances of the publication of the
matter complained of were such that the person defamed was not
likely to suffer
harm because of that person's generally bad reputation prior to the publication
of the matter.
10 - Defence concerning offer of amends
when an offer of amends is not accepted
The publisher of matter that is or may be defamatory of
another person may make to the person an offer of amends under this Division.
If an offer of amends is made under this Division and the offeree
does not accept the offer, it is a defence to proceedings by the
against the offerer for damages for defamation in respect of the matter in
question that:
(a) the offerer made the offer as soon as practicable after becoming aware
that the matter is or may be defamatory of the offeree;
(b) the offerer is ready and willing to perform the offer on acceptance by the
offeree at any time before the start of the trial
on issues in relation to the
defence; and
(c) in all the circumstances, the offer is reasonable.
In determining whether the offer is reasonable, regard is to be had
to any correction or apology published, or action taken, by the
publisher or
any other person at any time before the occasion for determination arises.
Particulars
in support of offer
An offer of amends:
(a) must be expressed to be made under this Division; and
(b) must include an offer to publish, or join in publishing, such correction
(if any) of the matter in question as is reasonable;
(c) must include an offer to publish, or join in publishing, such apology (if
any) to the offeree as is reasonable; and
(d) if material containing the matter in question has been delivered to a
person by the publisher or with the publisher's knowledge,
must include an
offer to take, or join in taking, such action (if any) as is reasonable for the
purpose of notifying the recipient
that the matter in question is or may be
defamatory of the offeree; and
(e) particulars of any correction or apology made or action taken, before the
date of the offer; and
(f) may include an offer of recompense for the expenses of the offeree
incurred because of the publication of the matter in question.
Determination
of questions
If an offer of amends is accepted, the court may, on
application made by a party to the offer, determine any question as to the
to be taken in performance of the agreement arising by acceptance of the
offer and an appeal does not lie from such a determination.
The court may, of its own motion or at the request of a party to
proceedings or prospective party to threatened proceedings in defamation,
appoint a mediator to advise on a correction or apology in an offer of
The mediator may advise on the following matters:
(a) the contents of the correction or apology;

11 - Defence of Innocent Publication
of innocent publication
It is a defence that the publication of the matter complained of
was an innocent publication.
For the purposes of this Part, if matter is published by a person,
and the matter is or may be defamatory of another person, the publication
"innocent" as regards the other person if, at and before the time of
publication, each of the involved persons:
(a) exercises reasonable care in relation to the matter and its publication;
(b) does not intend the matter to be defamatory of the person; and
(c) does not know and could not reasonably be expected to know the
circumstances because of which the matter is or may be defamatory
The "involved persons" are the publisher and the publisher's
employees and agents concerned with the matter in question or with
publication.
12 - Defence of statement from the Speaker's Corner
of words spoken at the Speaker's Corner
There is a defence of words spoken without electronic
or mechanical aid at the Speaker's Corner in Glebe Park between midday and
2:00pm on any Sunday.

reply, the mediator may approve the form of the statement or reply.
A mediator may be appointed to advise on a correction statement
even though an application for an order has not been made.
5 - DAMAGES
Subject to this section, damages for defamation are to be the
damages recoverable in accordance with the common law.
In determining the amount of damages to be awarded in any
successful defamation proceedings:
(a) the court shall ensure that there is an appropriate and rational
relationship between the relevant harm and the amount of damages
awarded; and
(b) the court is to take into account the ordinary level of general damages
component in personal injury awards in the ACT.
No special damage need be alleged or proven.
General damages may not be awarded in relation to a matter where
the person defamed died before the action was commenced or during
the course of
the proceedings.
or falsity of matter
If it is relevant to the amount of damages whether the matter
complained of was or was not true or substantially true:
(a) there is no presumption as to whether the matter was or was not true or
substantially true; and
(b) evidence as to whether the matter was or was not true or substantially
true may be adduced by any party (whether or not evidence
on the subject is
adduced by any other party).
In proceedings for damages for defamation in respect of the
publication of any matter, evidence is admissible on behalf of the defendant,
in mitigation of damages, that the plaintiff:
(a) has already recovered damages; or
(b) has brought proceedings for damages; or
(c) has received or agreed to receive compensation,
for defamation in respect of another publication of matter to the same purport
or effect as the matter complained of in the proceedings.
In assessing damages or awarding costs the court is to take into
account whether or not a correction statement was sought or published
promptness and prominence with which the correction statement was published.
In assessing damages or awarding costs the court is to take into
account whether or not an offer of amends was made and the circumstances
which the offer of amends was made.
6 - CRIMINAL DEFAMATION
A person must not, without lawful excuse, publish matter
defamatory of another living person:
(a) with intent to cause serious harm to any person (whether the person
defamed or not); or
(b) if it is probable that the publication of the defamatory matter will cause
serious harm to another person (whether the person
defamed or not) with
knowledge of that probability.
Penalty: 3 years or $5,000
In subsection (1), "publish" has the meaning that it has in the law
of tort relating to defamation.
Proceedings for an offence against this section may be started only
with the written consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions
within 6 months
of the offence.
In proceedings for an offence against this section, a consent
purporting to have been signed by the Director of Public Prosecutions
without proof of signature, evidence of the consent of the Director of Public
Prosecutions.
However, if the Director of Public Prosecutions would be a
defendant in any proceedings for an offence against this section, the
references in this section are to be read as references to the Attorney-General.
A person accused of an offence against this Act in respect of
the publication of matter defamatory of another person has lawful excuse
the publication only if, had the other person brought proceedings against the
accused for damages for defamation in respect of
the publication of the matter,
the accused would be entitled to succeed in those proceedings.
However, regard is to be had only to the events happening before
and at the time of publication.
If an information or other statement of a charge of an offence
against this Act alleges that the accused published the matter in
without lawful excuse, it is not necessary to negative, in the information or
other statement, any thing which would amount
to lawful excuse under this
At the trial of a person accused of an offence against this Act, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to negative any thing which
would amount
to lawful excuse under this section unless an issue respecting the thing is
raised by evidence at the trial.
Once such an issue is raised, the onus of establishing absence of
lawful excuse lies on the prosecution.
No inference of guilt is to be made from the publication of a
correction statement under this Act.
7 - MISCELLANEOUS

person includes, except in so far as
the context or subject-matter otherwise
indicates or requires, a reference to the executor, administrator or other
of a court to order decision to be published

The Committee is considering the related issue of privacy
in a separate exercise.
These are briefly outlined in Attachment "A".
This issue is canvassed in greater detail by the New South Wales
Law Reform Commission's Report on
(LRC 75, 1995) at pp 6-9.
As part of this reference, the Committee met on a number of occasions with the
New South Wales Law Reform
Commission and has carefully followed the progress
of that reference.
Graham Hryce, a senior associate practicing in the area
of defamation has said, in a perceptive analysis of the New South Wales Law
Reform Commission's Report, that the report kills hope of a unified national
law (Reformers open a Pandora's Box, Canberra Times,
8/11/1995, p13). He said:
"Perhaps the most surprising characteristic of the report is its parochialism
and its explicit rejection
of the goal of national uniformity for defamation

In particular, the Committee held a conference on Ethics and the
Media (25-26 May 1991) in Canberra to debate the issues of defamation
ethics. This followed an earlier seminar held by the Kingswood Institute of
Applied Ethics in March 1991. Speakers included
Justice Marcus Einfield of the
Federal Court of Australia, Mr John Langmore, MHR, Dr Satendra Nanden, of the
University of Canberra,
and Ms Wendy Bacon, of the University of Technology,
Sydney. The conference attracted print and broadcasting journalists, lawyers
and academics working in communications. Discussion demonstrated the practical
difficulties a working journalist faces on a daily
in reconciling the various
theoretical and ethical considerations. Justice Einfield, in a paper on Human
Rights and the Media, canvassed
the major legal and social issues affected by
the media in Australia. Using examples such as the coverage of the Gulf War and
in the way comment is presented as 'news', Justice Einfield argued that
media self-regulation was an inadequate means of preventing
abuse of human
rights. Privacy, contempt and the accuracy of information in the media often
conflicted with commercial and circulation
imperatives. Rather, Justice
Einfield argued that media ownership, power and behaviour should be the subject
of a national inquiry
or Royal Commission and then to on-going independent
review. In a related paper on press ownership, Mr John Langmore endorsed the
need for an independent review of media practices. At the conference, Mr Peter
Quinton (Director of ACT Law Reform) presented a paper
on models for change.
This paper presented various options pursued overseas to provide independent
review of media activities and
ensure media compliance with stated ethical
standards. The paper examined challenges inherent in self-regulation and the
availability
of current remedies. It then examined in detail the Austrian
legislative model: a law that specifically addresses the responsibilities
needs of the media.
There was great diversity in
submissions to the Committee. Some sought wholesale statutory reform of the
law. At the other (and alone
of those who made submissions to the Committee) Mr
Bruce Connell argued for a return to the common law. He argued that the common
law is well equipped to deal with defamation actions. He argued that the common
law of defamation has not become too technical and
complex, as it is based on
sound common sense. Amendments to the common law have created complexity,
confusion and expense. He noted
that statutory provisions would be necessary in
relation to the issue of absolute privilege.
The Committee does not propose to discuss modern actions
similar to defamation which are now found in section 52 of the Commonwealth
Trade Practices Act 1974
and the ACT
Fair Trading Act.
these provisions are specifically aimed at business and consumer issues. They
do not rely on concepts and procedures in
defamation law.
The existing statutory law does not define defamation but
adds a number of statutory glosses to defences and other matters.

Section 3 of the
Defamation Act 1901,
following the
reforms in NSW of 1847 effectively provides that the rules concerning libel
apply also to slander. However, surprisingly,
the various laws dealing with
criminal defamation still draw practical distinctions between written and
spoken defamation.
The John Fairfax Group opposed codification although it
argued that some defences should be provided by statute.
The ALP (ACT Branch) submission suggested the ALRC
definition ie. a defamatory matter is the publishing of an untrue or misleading
matter concerning a person which: adversely affects the reputation of that
person in the estimation of ordinary persons; deters ordinary
persons from
association or dealing with that person; or injures that person in his or her
occupation, trade, office or financial
That the material conveys one or more defamatory
imputations is relevant to determine if the matter is truly defamatory.
The NSW approach has been the subject considerable
criticism within the ACT. Commenting on the NSWLRC Report 75 Graham Hryce also
noted that "[T]here is a very real question as to whether common law

From a procedural point of view the Committee notes that it will
hasten the resolution of actions if the alleged innuendo, if necessary,
provided to the defendant, together with other information, at a very early
stage in the pre-trial process.
Pulling v G.E. Ry
(1882) 9 Q.B.D. 110
Mr Roderick Campbell and Mr Peter Sutherland disagreed
with the majority position. They generally supported the existing position
common law in relation to this matter. Mr Campbell was prepared to contemplate
such an action after death where actual financial
loss could be established.
Plutarch, in discussing the life of the great Athenian law maker
Solon points to three other reasons for restraint: "Another law
which is highly praised is the one forbidding anyone to speak ill of the dead,
for piety requires us to regard the dead
as sacred, justice to refrain from
attacking the absent, and political wisdom to prevent the perpetuation of
hatreds." Plutarch,

In Queensland, Tasmania and the ACT, in addition to
proving truth, the defendant must also prove the matter published was 'for the
public benefit'. In New South Wales an imputation must be shown to be 'of
substantial truth' and to be 'a matter of public interest'.
Plutarch notes that the law maker Solon had the following
confrontation with Thespis, the `father' of tragedy: "At this time Thespis
beginning to develop performances of tragedy and the novelty of his enterprise
attracted most of the city to watch, although
it had not yet been made the
object of regular competition. Solon had always been a good listener and ready
to learn something new,
and now in his old age had become even fonder of
leisure and entertainment, and for that matter wine and song, too, and so he
to watch Thespis act in his own play, as the ancient poets usually did.
After the performance was over, he went up to Thespis and
asked him whether he
was not ashamed to tell such lies in front of so many people. When Thespis
replied that there was no harm in
speaking or acting in this way in
make-believe, Solon struck the ground angrily with his staff and exclaimed,
"Yes, but if we allow
ourselves to praise and honour make-believe like this,
the next thing will be to find it creeping into our serious business".

ie, that "statements which are true, but unnecessary
and cruel" should also be remedied under defamation laws
see also the recommendation of the NSWLRC in Report 75
(LRC 75, 1995) at p.37. The Committee is developing a separate series of
recommendations
on this issue.
Mr Roderick Campbell argues that issues of privacy
should not form part of the law of defamation. He argues that a separate action
for privacy should deal with the issue.
The Committee was not persuaded that there was a
difference of substance between the formulations of `public benefit' and
interest'. On balance, the Committee preferred the more modern NSW
formulation. Further, the Committee noted that the proposed defence
easily changed by amendment if a tort of invasion of privacy became law by
removing the public interest provision and leaving
truth alone as the

basically declaratory.

The Committee also notes overlapping Commonwealth
parliamentary protections in the
Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987
particularly
of that Act that provides a specific defence concerning
a report of proceedings. The broader issue of parliamentary privilege is
outside the ambit of this report.
Note that `Parliamentary body' includes the Legislative
Assembly, either House of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Parliament, or
House of the Parliament, of a State; and the Legislative Assembly of the
Northern Territory.
Royal Aquarium v Parkinson
[1892] 1 Q.B. at
In this context, a "specified non-curial body" means a body :
* established by statutory provision or required by the rules of natural
justice (other than a domestic forum which derives its authority
solely from
the submission or consent of the parties); and
* capable of making a final determination affecting the status or rights of any
person or capable of making a report having a "major
influence" on the ultimate
decision; and
* required to determine the truth and justice of a matter of public concern;
"proceedings" includes any preliminary procedural steps
required or permitted
by law to be taken.
For these purposes a "parliamentary body" should include a
parliament or legislature of any country, a house of a parliament or
legislature
of any country, a committee of a parliament or legislature of any
country, or a committee of a house or houses of a parliament or
legislature of
any country.

Sections 5 of the

an apology to mitigate damages and section 8 provides for a defence of apology
and payment into court. The pleading must
be that the libel was without actual
malice and without gross negligence.
section 28, ACT
Supreme Court Act
Supreme Court proceedings from 1988 to 1993 were also
examined, but because many of these matters had not proceeded to finality,
was considered unwise to rely on the later cases to found observations about
the system. However, the progress of these later
cases has been used for
comparative purposes.
Indeed, the procedural law seems to be misunderstood by some
practitioners. Many did not seem to be aware of the special application
rules to defamation proceedings. For example, mandatory Supreme Court Rules
were not adhered to in relation to the filing
of a Statement of Claim after the
initiating writ in about 18% of cases.
The Committee notes earlier research by the ALRC over a
number of jurisdictions to the effect that only 5% of matters commenced were
set down for hearing and only 3% were heard. ALRC Report 11, paras 52-6.
Such actions are sometimes categorised as 'stop-writs'
(ie, writs issued with no intention to proceed to a determination of the
substantive
issue in contention but to pressure the defendant into silence).
Although the Committee notes that these time deadlines may
be extended by consent of the parties.
against defendants that were recognisably media proprietors
Many plaintiffs were ordinary citizens. Invariably under
the present system, for a plaintiff to lose a libel action could mean the
of all he or she owns including the family home. The plaintiff may have a
strong case, but in any litigation, success cannot
be guaranteed.
These figures supports anecdotal information which
suggests that the average time spent between the issue of the writ and the
commencement
of trial in the ACT can vary between two-and-a-half and
three-and-a-half years and it is unusual for a trial to come on within 18
months after the date of the issue of a writ.
Anecdotal evidence tends to suggest that many of these
are often frivolous or misconceived. Some may be deliberate ploys to "wear
down" the other party. This takes additional time and expense. Interlocutory
applications are sometimes necessary but in some cases
they become point-taking
exercises to put the plaintiff or defendant to additional expense and
frustration in the hope that he or
she will abandon the action or else settle
for a trivial amount - perhaps less than he or she would be awarded at trial.
Delay in finalising a defamation action and the
associated expense imposes great stress and cost on litigants. To provide some
illustrations
of the costs involved, it is not unusual for a party to incur
costs of between $75,000 - $100,000 (in addition to the verdict) for
that lasts approximately two weeks. These figures include pre-trial
preparation. In addition, the unsuccessful party usually
has to pay the other
parties legal costs in a similar sum. Defamation cases, as with any other
complex litigation, usually justify
the retention of senior and junior counsel.
The daily rate for each party so represented works out at about $9,000. In
addition there
are incidental costs for transcripts, witnesses' expenses and
the like while the case is proceeding.
Mr Ryan argued that court procedures are too long and
costly; the process adversely affects family and friends as well as the
(stress etc). The process can wipe a private person out. Defamation
affects a lot of ordinary persons (even more so than the rich
or famous). The
plaintiff has to prove the defamation - a very traumatic experience (ie. having
to get people in to attest your good
Insofar as that is the case, the Canberra Times is an
exception to the general rule. It has been at pains to make it clear to this
Committee and to the earlier inquiry by the Legislative Assembly that it is the
policy of that newspaper to correct and apologise
promptly where the
circumstances so warrant.

Rules of the Court Discussion Paper, CLRC 1992
It has been argued that the use of the law of defamation acted as
a significant deterrent to publicity concerning the abuses at Chelmsford
hospital. The failure to publish details of the abuses may have allowed these
abuses to continue longer than they would have had
the information been
publicly available.

Justice Russell Fox considered an application for
particulars on a statement of claim
in Hadzel v De. Waldorf
He noted (p.176):...a defendant cannot necessarily be expected to
ascertain all the defamatory imputations for himself. In the present
is not only the problem of attaching a meaning or meanings to a particular
passage or passages, there is the problem of
knowing what passages are said to
be defamatory. The defendant (and the Court) should be told what the plaintiff
alleges in regard
to these matters.

[1966] HCA 36
(1966) 117 CLR 423
(1878) 3 QBD 722.
Hall v Nominal Defendant
, the Chief
Justice said: The matter, it seems to me, is quite different from the case of
successive applications for extensions of
time for the taking of a step in an
action or for setting aside a default judgment in an action. In these cases,
the matter is under
the control of and generally within the discretion of the
court in which the action is brought. Also, the action is brought to enforce
rights which, if they exist, derive from facts or circumstances apart from the
statute or jurisdiction which gives the court control
of the proceedings. The
dismissal of an action for insufficiency in a statement of claim, or the entry
of a non-suit is also quite
different. In such cases the right, if any exists,
is not determined by the order. But in the case of an application for extension
of time under the Act, the only power given to the court is a power given in
relation to an application to extend time. The questions
for the court upon
such an application are whether a sufficient reason has been given for the
failure to sue in time, and, if so,
whether it is just in all the circumstances
to grant or refuse the application.

of the statement complained of, the defendant shall not be entitled on the
trial to give evidence in chief, with a view to mitigation
of damages, as to
the circumstances under which the defamation was published, or as to the
character of the plaintiff, without the
leave of the Judge, unless seven days
at least before the trial he furnishes particulars to the plaintiff of the
matters as to which
he intends to give evidence.

The Calcutt Committee (1990 Cm1102) and the Neil
Report (Supreme Court Procedure Committee, Report on Practice and Procedure in
Defamation,
July 1991) cast some doubt on the utility of the offence.
The Committee notes that
Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987
has abolished criminal proceedings for
contempt by defamation of the Commonwealth Parliament, House or Committee.
Mr Roderick Campbell disagrees with this recommendation.
He considers that the offence should be abolished. He queries the utility
the offence and its theoretical underpinnings.
