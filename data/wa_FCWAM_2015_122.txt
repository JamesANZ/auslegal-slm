WORDS IN SQUARE BRACKETS REPLACE WORDS USED IN THE ORIGINAL JUDGMENT -
PARTIES’ NAMES AND IDENTIFYING DETAILS HAVE BEEN CHANGED
1 This matter involves a consideration of the
Rice & Asplund
which is a principle of law
established from the decision of
In the marriage of Rice & Asplund
[1978] FamCAFC 128
(1979) FLC 90-725.
This decision has evolved into a longstanding principle
in which the Court must firstly consider whether the principle is to be
considered on a preliminary basis or one after a detailed investigation. In
addition, the Court must, in considering such a principle,
still take into
account the best interests of children and the various provisions such as the
objects and principles of the Act in
coming to its determination (see the views
of Warnick J in
[2008] FamCAFC 16
(2008) FLC 93-363
and [65]). As
Warnick J said at [81] in
Thus, in my view, when the threshold question described in
Rice & Asplund
is determined as a preliminary matter, it
remains a determination “on the merits”. Where an application is
at a preliminary stage, it is not dismissed for some technical reason,
such as the failure of the party to appear or some lack of
compliance with form
and procedure, but rather because, assuming the evidence of the applicant is
accepted, there is an insufficient
change of circumstance shown to justify
embarking on a hearing. Though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion
will, or ought
be, about the interests of the child in not being subjected to
further litigation, is more powerfully in the child’s welfare,
allow the application to continue.
2 It is clear that the
Court must, if determining the matter at a preliminary stage, take the
applicant’s case at its highest
and proceed on the basis that the evidence
produced by the applicant is correct. This view is also supported by the Full
Poisat & Poisat
(2014) FLC 93-597.
3 The Court in this matter is satisfied that the principle should be decided
on a preliminary basis in all the circumstances.
Rice and Asplund
principle is that there must be a sufficient
change in circumstances between the making of final orders in relation to
issues and the filing of fresh proceedings.
Miller & Harrington
[2008] FamCAFC 150
, the Full Court
considered an appeal by the mother against orders made by Barry J to
dismiss her fresh application on the basis of
the rule in
. At the original trial, Buckley J found, amongst other things,
and this is set out at [106] of the Full Court decision, that:
the mother was
unable to facilitate a positive relationship between the children and the
the mother was
of the view that the children should choose for themselves whether they see
their father or not and, for example, had
told the children in the waiting room
of the report writer that they did not have to see their father if they elected
each child had
indicated to the report writer that they did not wish to see their father;
the mother had
“over exposed” the children to the dispute. The elder child
made it clear she did not want any contact
with the father;
the children
have been unduly and negatively influenced by the mother and she was unable to
facilitate a relationship between the
children and the father while they resided
if the children
were placed with the father they would experience emotional and behavioural
difficulties in the short term as they
learned to adjust;
if the children
did not reside with the father, contact orders would be ineffectual; and
eventuality, the relationship between the father and the children would further
deteriorate.
6 The Full Court accepted that taking the
mother’s case at its highest, the asserted changes of circumstances
appeared to be
[at 110] that:
the father and
his family denigrated the mother to the children which had caused the elder
child to leave the father’s care
(a matter which Mr Page SC described
before Barry J as “the most important” of the changes that had
occurred since Buckley
J’s judgment.);
the mother had
given birth to a child and a relationship had developed between the children and
that child and separation from that
child was “a source of some
the children
left the father’s residence “unaided by either of their
parents” and had chosen to “go back into
that action was
an indication of the stress the children were under;
the children
were now aged 14 and 11 (as opposed to 12 and nine before Buckley J).
7 In those circumstances, the Full Court found that the matters
said to be changes on behalf of the mother were in fact [at 116]:
manifestations of the fact that the central matters found by
Buckley J including the antipathy of the children toward their
the difficulties his Honour said would exist for the children on a
change in their residential care, the inability of the mother
to promote or
foster a relationship between the children and their father and the influence of
the mother’s attitudes on the
wishes of the children – continued to
8 In those circumstances the appeal by the mother was
9 These principles were recently followed in the Full Court decision of
Carriel & Lendrum
[2015] FamCAFC 43
(2015) FLC 93-640.
The Full Court acknowledged
that the trial Judge [at 25] recorded that the “rule” in
was the subject of detailed consideration in
[2008] FamCAFC 150
(2008) FLC 93-383
(2008) FLC 93363 and
Collivas & Cassimatis
[2007] FMCAFam 293.
The Full Court
acknowledged that his Honour correctly accepted that the mother’s evidence
should be taken at its highest and
that the “threshold question”
enunciated in
Rice & Asplund
is determined as a preliminary matter,
and on the merits. His Honour also made it clear that he would assume that the
evidence of
the mother is accepted in order to assess whether there was a
sufficient change of circumstances to justify embarking on a hearing.
10 His Honour referred to the above-mentioned quote by Warnick J in
The factual background
11 In the previous proceedings between these
parties, the mother filed the original proceedings on 8 March 2010. A response
filed by the father on 12 April 2010. The matter eventually proceeded
to a trial listing to commence not before 31 July 2013. The
trial had in
late stages been Judge Managed by Moncrieff J.
12 On 8 April 2013, his Honour dealt with a number of issues including the
listing of a contravention application filed by the father
and the provision of
a further updating report by the single expert, Dr Phil Watts. His Honour
adjourned the matter to 13 May 2013
and then further adjourned it to 24 June
2013. On that occasion both parties were represented by experienced counsel.
The father’s
counsel effectively advised the Court that the father sought
to withdraw from the proceedings. On that basis the Court made the
trial in this matter listed to commence not before 31 July 2013 be and is
hereby vacated.

be no order as to costs.
outstanding applications and responses otherwise be and are hereby
13 The above orders therefore brought an end to the
proceedings that had been before the Court for over three years.
14 The father then filed fresh proceedings on 10 December 2014, only 18
months later. The matter came before me on 19 January 2015.
Given the previous
involvement of his Honour, the proceedings were adjourned to his Honour on
23 March 2015. On that date his Honour
made orders in relation to the
filing of affidavit material by the father that would specifically address the
Rice & Asplund
issues and otherwise adjourned the matter back before
15 The father filed that affidavit as required on 10 April 2015. In it he
acknowledges a number of issues including:
(a) I have made some mistakes, but what parent hasn’t;
successfully completed many courses and also attended
counselling sessions with child psychologist, Carol Smith, who was recommended
by Dr Watts [emphasis added];
(c) I now have a better understanding of how to deal with these situations and
my only focus is on my daughters’ health and
(d) I have completed all courses and counselling as requested by Dr Watts
and the Court, I also completed several other courses that
I felt would be
beneficial in helping deal with issue [sic] concerning the girls;
(e) The courses recommended and I have successfully completed are Mums &
Dads Forever, Holyoake, 123 Magic, Challenging the Fury
Within, also attended
counselling sessions with child psychologist, Carol Smith.
(f) Other courses I have attended to better myself are Self Esteem and Changing
Negative Thinking, Assertive Communication, I have
also read Dr Watts’
book “Shared Care or Divided Lives” and purchased the 123 Magic
(g) He asserts that the reason he withdrew from the previous proceedings was
that he believed the ongoing legal action was having
a detrimental effect on his
daughters and on both the mother and him emotionally and financially. He
asserts that he was not aware
of the ramifications of withdrawing from the legal
proceedings and “regrettably my lawyers did not advise me of the
consequences”.
He claims he was not aware that he would no longer have
any rights or influence in the girls’ development and wellbeing.
asserts that if he had known these facts at the time he would not have
withdrawn. He hoped that by withdrawing from the proceedings
emotions could
subside and in time the parents could re-engage on an amicable level and discuss
what was in the best interests of
the children.
(h) He says that since final orders were made he received on average monthly
calls from the child, [Child B],
lasting between 35 and 55 minutes
which went well. Given a violence restraining order that was in place at the
time, he was not able
to call [Child B] so he was left to receive calls from her
whenever they occurred. He last spoke to [Child B] on 19 July 2014.
During that conversation she expressed feelings of love for the father. He
claimed to have been at a school assembly the week before
that phone call.
He acknolwedged he has not spoken to his daughter, [Child A], in nearly
four years.
16 There are some difficulties with the assertions
set out by the father above.
17 The various courses that he relies upon (and there are annexures which
confirm his attendances) are all courses that were attended
well prior to the
orders in June 2013. Much of it is in 2010 which is well prior to even the
single expert report. There is no
evidence of any involvement in courses
the 2013 orders were made [emphasis added].
18 In my view, the fact that the phone calls were occurring for some period
of time after the orders were made is not particularly
relevant. More
importantly, the phone calls were not made pursuant to an order and the
cessation of those calls was therefore not
a breach of an order. Those phone
calls were something that the child felt comfortable in doing following the
dismissal of these
proceedings and it may be something the child feels
comfortable in doing in the future. The mother accepted that the father was
the assembly in July 2014. He accepts however that he did not see either child
at the assembly given the large number of students.
19 I am conscious that there may be a stronger reason to refuse the
relitigation of parenting issues where a Court has finally determined
application on its merits. In this case that would have been after a trial
had taken place and evidence was tested and a judgment
was delivered. It would
be, in my view, a stronger case were those circumstances to have existed in this
matter. The parties in
the previous proceedings would have been put through
that process and the evidence would have been tested and findings of fact made
by the trial Judge. In my view, in those circumstances, it would be more
difficult to argue a change in circumstances.
20 It must be kept in mind, however, that this was a matter where the father
withdrew from proceedings. Again, this is different,
in my view, to a situation
where orders are made by default; perhaps for the reason of some technical lack
of compliance with an
order such as an order for the filing of affidavit
material or a lack of appearance. In this case, the father was legally advised
by an experienced practitioner whether he received advice as to the implications
of his decision is something he will need to deal
with with his advisor at the
time. From the Court’s perspective however, it is faced with an
application by a father to relitigate
precisely the same issues that were before
the Court for a period of over three years. Those proceedings culminated
in final orders
in June 2013 and it is
18 months later that the
father seeks to relitigate these issues [emphasis added]. It would appear the
father has had a change of
heart and regrets his decision to withdraw from the
proceedings. He did so under advice, however, and must accept the consequences
of his actions. Given the asserted changes in circumstances and taking them at
their highest, I am not satisfied that there is a
sufficient change in
circumstance to justify relitigating these issues again. In all the
circumstances therefore, the application
by the husband will be dismissed. It
is not in these children’s best interests to relitigate over these issues
as the husband
appropriately acknowledged the previous proceedings were no doubt
having an emotional effect on both parties and on the children.
appropriate in all the circumstances to risk creating that ongoing effect again
by relitigating.
proceedings before the Court are dismissed.
