REASONS FOR DECISION
3 October 2025 our substantive orders and reasons were published. In the orders
we made provision for application in respect of
costs of the appeal. One party,
being the respondent owners corporation (OC), was legally represented with a
grant of leave for
legal representation to that party on the appeal on 25
October 2024.
our substantive decision we refused leave to appeal (to the extent that leave
was required) and dismissed the appeal.
accord with our costs directions, both parties filed submissions, the
appellant’s in response to the OC’s written submissions
seeking its
costs on the ordinary basis as agreed or assessed and not seeking a further
hearing on costs. The appellant did not object
to that means of determining
costs and accepted that the ordinary costs rules applied, but resisted any order
for costs and said
that we should exercising discretion in that way “to
decide what is fair”.
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
(NSW) (NCAT Act),
together with
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Rules 2014
(NSW) (the Rules), provide that the ordinary costs rules apply, even in the
absence of special circumstances required by s 60 of
the NCAT Act, where
“the amount claimed or in dispute in the proceedings is more than
$30,000”. Rule 38A applies the
costs rules applicable in the primary
decision to the costs of the appeal.
Allen v TriCare (Hastings) Ltd
[2017] NSWCATAP 25
Appeal Panel found that “‘[P]roceedings’” refers to the
process set in motion, or commenced, by lodging
an application or notice of
appeal. That process includes the steps taken by the Tribunal to hear and
determine whether to grant
the relief sought in the application or notice of
appeal, as well as any interlocutory or ancillary steps. Proceedings are defined
by the subject matter raised in the application or notice of appeal. The
participants in proceedings are limited to the parties determined
in accordance
with [s 44 of the NCAT Act and the Rules]”.
Owners SP 63341 v Malachite Holdings PL
[2018] NSWCATAP 256
the Appeal Panel summarised the operation of r 38 as follows, from the detailed
discussion at [86]-[111]:
“[3] Rule 38(2)(b) applies to the
following proceedings:
(1) Where the relief claimed in the proceedings is for an order to pay a
specific amount of money, or an order to be relieved from
an obligation to pay a
specific amount of money, and that amount is more than $30,000;
(2) Where an order is sought in the proceedings for the performance of an
obligation (such as to do work), and the Tribunal has power
make an order to pay
a specific amount of money, even if not asked for by the claimant, provided
(a) there is credible evidence relating to the amount the Tribunal could
(b) that evidence, if accepted, would establish an entitlement to an order
for an amount more than $30,000.
[4] Rule 38(2)(b) may also apply to proceedings where the orders sought in
the proceedings depend upon the claimant proving there
is a debt owed in order
to establish an entitlement to the relief sought, and that amount is in dispute
and is more than $30,000.
[5] Rule 38(2)(b) does not apply to proceedings:
(1) Where a claim for relief in the proceedings (not being a claim for an
order to be paid or be relieved from paying a specific sum)
consequence of that relief being granted, result in the loss of any property or
other civil right to a value of more than
$30,000; or
(2) Where there is a matter at issue amounting to or of a value of more than
$30,000 but:
(a) no direct relief is sought and no order could be made in the proceedings
requiring payment or relief from payment of an amount
more than $30,000; or
(b) the relief sought does not depend on there being a finding that a
specific amount of money is owed.”
Hanave PL v Wine Nomad PL
[2022] NSWCATAP 361
Panel expounded aspects of the above summary which were not the subject of
findings in the partly-successful appeal to
the Supreme Court on aspects of the
substantive decision
[2023] NSWSC 265:
“[40] As made clear in
at [75] and following, r 38 is not concerned with the value of
rights that might be in issue or any change in wealth. Unlike
s 101(2)(r)
Supreme Court Act 1970
(NSW), r 38 does not require consideration of
whether the proceedings:
(1) involve a matter at issue amounting to or of a value of $30,000 or more,
(2) involve (directly or indirectly) any claim, demand or question to or
respecting any property or civil right amounting to or of
the value of $30,000
[41] Rather, r 38(2)(b) applies where “the amount claimed or in dispute
in the proceedings is more than $30,000”.
[42] The questions to be determined are what is the amount
“claimed”, what is the amount “in dispute” and
“the proceedings” in circumstances where there are two applications,
the second in the nature of a cross-application
application”)”.
it is clear that the threshold amount was exceeded on the test as explained in
. The cost or value of the
kitchen works the subject of one of the owner’s claims ($82,500) alone
clearly exceeded $30,000:

principles governing costs are authoritatively explored in
[1990] HCA 59
(1990) 170 CLR 534
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
[1998] HCA 11
which have been followed and applied in the Tribunal, among many
instances, in
Thompson v Chapman

, citing earlier consistent authority, and in

(1) The exercise of the discretion is principled but involves impression and
evaluation.
(2) The starting point for the exercise of costs discretion on the usual
principles is that costs are compensatory for having to
contest the proceedings
to achieve the outcome, and normally follow the event.
(3) “The event” is usually the overall outcome of the proceedings
– did the successful party have to go to the
court or tribunal to get what
it achieved, rather than being offered at least that relief prior to
commencement of the proceedings.
(4) If there are distinct, separate or dominant issues on which the party
seeking relief did not succeed, that may be taken into
account in the exercise
of costs discretion, either as an award of costs of those issues to the party
who had success on them or
as a discount of the costs of the overall successful
party, or some other appropriate exercise of principled discretion.
(5) There may be no order as to costs made (to the intent that each party pays
its or their own costs) where there has been a measure
of success on both

; applied in
Oppidan Homes PL v Yang

(6) Costs are usually ordered on the ordinary basis as agreed or assessed,
unless the parties tender material and/or make submissions
that justify an award
of costs on the indemnity basis as agreed or assessed, in whole or part.
(7) For an award of costs on other than the ordinary basis, a party’s
conduct of the proceedings themselves, or the nature
of the proceedings
themselves (for instance, misconceived), or unreasonable refusal of an offer
(often when an outcome less favourable
than an offer is achieved in the
litigation), are considered.
OC submitted that it had succeeded on every contested issue properly the subject
of appeal, which was correct, and therefore succeeded
on “the event”
with no reason to depart from the usual outcome in that circumstance.
appellant submitted the following reasons (in summary) that there should be no
order as to costs despite the ordinary costs rules
(1) She brought the appeal “in good faith to correct what I believed were
errors about serious property damage caused by the
[OC’s] contractors. I
have always acted honestly and co-operatively as a self-represented
be consistent with fairness,
proportionality and the Tribunal’s role in providing accessible justice to
in good faith”.
(2) The appellant repeated in substance her version of the chronology of events
and the OC’s alleged conduct which have relevantly
been dealt with in our
substantive decision.
(3) The appellant said that she “acted reasonably and the [OC’s] own
conduct caused much of the delay and confusion,
fairness requires that each
party bear its own costs”. Again, the relevant facts were dealt with in
our substantive decision.
(4) The appellant denied delaying the proceedings, said that any early
disorganisation was corrected on appeal and that “imperfect
presentation” did not equal unreasonable conduct.
(5) The appellant denied introducing new claims except for the alleged
“improper conduct” of the strata liaison owner,
which should in any
event be treated as special circumstances “due to the ongoing stress and
unsafe conditions that I am facing
living within this strata”.
(6) The appellant said that she raised arguable issues.
(7) The appellant said that no special circumstances under s 60(2) of the NCAT
Act had been raised and that, for costs to be awarded,
a case must be frivolous,
vexatious or unreasonable. This sought to apply factors which apply where the
ordinary costs rules do not
(8) The appellant would be paying twice – through her levies and through
the costs order. This failed to recognise that, if
the OC was reimbursed by a
costs order, any legal expenses that it had already paid from levies could be
refunded or held against
other OC expenses which otherwise would be the subject
of a levy on lot owners.
(9) The OC had its legal expenses funded by levies when the appellant had relied
on free community legal advice from Fair Trading,
a private firm and a legal
of the foregoing reasons altered the operation of the rules governing the usual
costs outcome. In particular, they did not acknowledge
that the authorities
cited above make it clear that costs awarded on the ordinary basis are a
compensation to the party who obtains
a costs order for having to conduct the
proceedings, not a punishment.
OC is accordingly entitled to its costs of the appeal against the appellant lot
make the following orders:
(1) Order that a further hearing on costs is dispensed with.
(2) Order that the appellant pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal on
the ordinary basis as agreed or assessed.
I hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for
decision of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of New
