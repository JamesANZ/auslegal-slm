Tribunal’s decision:
The Tribunal made a community
treatment order with a duration of 26 Weeks expiring on
21/09/2025.
This statement of reasons:
After the hearing
you requested a written explanation of the Tribunal's decision. A copy of this
statement of reasons will be given
to your treating team as well as to
THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
1. Reason for the hearing
This hearing was held because your treating team
applied for another treatment order. The Tribunal had to have a hearing to
whether or not to make a treatment order.
2. The law the Tribunal had to apply to make a decision
To make this decision the Tribunal had to
consider whether the compulsory treatment criteria applied to you. The
compulsory treatment
criteria are listed in the
Mental Health and Wellbeing
(‘the Act’) and are attached.
Under the Act the Tribunal must give proper consideration to the mental
health and wellbeing principles (‘principles’).
Based on the
information provided in your hearing and our understanding of your
circumstances, the Tribunal identified the following
principles were
particularly relevant to its decision:
Dignity and
restriction
decision making
are discussed later in these reasons.
The Tribunal must also give proper
consideration to your rights under the
Charter of Human Rights and
Responsibilities
(‘the Charter’). Compulsory
treatment engages and limits a number of human rights protected under the
Charter including
consent, and where a person is being treated in hospital, freedom of movement.
To give proper consideration to your rights protected under the Charter, and
whether limits on them are reasonable, the Tribunal
must thoroughly examine
three things:
whether the
compulsory treatment criteria apply to you;
if it is making
or confirming a treatment order, whether you can be treated in the community;
if authorised to
do so, how long the treatment order should last.
3. Overview of the information provided to the Tribunal at the
As you know your treating team prepared a report
for your hearing that they gave to you, they also provided some documents
from your file. You provided a written submission to the Tribunal.
This statement of reasons does not summarise all that information,
but the next
section refers to the information the Tribunal relied on to make its decision
and explains why.
The Tribunal must have regard to your views and
preferences. From what you told the Tribunal, and the materials we read, we
that you were a man in your forties and lived at home with your
mother. You were adamant that you did not experience any form of
mental illness.
You had never had any symptoms that could be attributed to a mental illness. You
believed that the treatment you
had been provided had caused you harm, including
causing you to have diabetes. You said that you had good engagement with the
team and did not lack insight into your mental health as the treating
team claimed.
4. The Tribunal’s decision about the compulsory treatment
The following summarises what the Tribunal
decided in relation to the four questions that need to be answered under the
treatment criteria.
(a) Do you have a mental illness?
There was a significant difference of opinion
between you and the treating team.
As noted above, it was your view that
you do not have a mental illness. In your submission, you explained that your
father, before
he passed away, made false claims to the treating team that you
had been hitting family members and damaging the family home.
you have physical health issues that mean you are unable to work. You have been
bothered by the treating team since 2009.
When asked why you believed
the treating team would falsely say that you had a mental illness, you said it
was so they could make
money. The more people on orders there were, the more
money they make.
You said that all your family and friends know that you
don’t have a mental illness and the treating team’s involvement
causing lots of family problems.
You are a religious person and are
concerned that your religious beliefs and manner of worship, is misunderstood as
a mental illness.
The treating team had a very different view. The
report stated that you were diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003 and had
inpatient admissions to treat your illness. Your last admission was in
early 2023. The diagnosis had been made based on observing
you and talking to
your close family members.
The report said that when unwell you exhibited
symptoms of a mental illness. These included: Increased agitation and being
aggressive to your mother and threatening violence; persecutory
delusions, namely beliefs you will be harmed; hearing voices stating
has told you not to take medication and not to waste time going to the toilet;
and a fixation that the medication is harming
you. When unwell you also had poor
self-care. The treating team were also of the view that you experienced what are
known as negative
symptoms of mental illness, inactivity, lack of enjoyment in
life (anhedonia) and apathy (lack of motivation).
The report described
how at the time of your last admission to hospital you were floridly psychotic.
That is, they observed symptoms
of psychosis.
When there is such a
difference of opinion the Tribunal must consider the evidence that has been
provided to it by everyone. We also
took into account that the law says that you
are not to be considered to have a mental illness because you express a
particular religious
belief or because you engage in particular religious
We do not accept that that the treating team would misdiagnose
you for profit. We note the lengthy time you have been engaged with
health services and the fact that a number of different people over an extensive
period of time, have observed you to have
the symptoms of a mental illness. We
understand that this is hard for you to accept but we also observe that often
people have no
memory of their symptoms when they recover.
satisfied that you had a significant disturbance of thought, mood and perception
and therefore did have a mental illness.
(b) Does your mental illness mean you need to be treated now,
to try and prevent your mental health or physical health seriously
deteriorating;
or to prevent serious harm to you or someone else?
The report noted, and TD confirmed at the
hearing, that you were admitted to hospital in early 2023 because you were
experiencing
symptoms of a mental illness. At the time you were admitted to
hospital you had not been taking your medication for a month. The
treating team
observed that when you started taking medication again, your symptoms improved.
The report also noted that since leaving
hospital and having regular medication,
your mental state has remained stable.
We were satisfied that you need
immediate treatment to prevent a serious deterioration in your mental health and
therefore this criterion
The treating team also stated that
when you become unwell you have been aggressive to your family. No details were
provided as to
the seriousness of any harm your family members experienced, or
the form that aggression took, other than verbal abuse. Although
verbal abuse
can be distressing, based on the material that was provided to us, we were not
satisfied that you needed immediate treatment
to prevent serious harm to someone
(c) Will you receive immediate treatment if you are on a
treatment order?
You are currently receiving treatment in the
form of anti-psychotic depot injection. We were satisfied this will continue if
on a treatment order.
You also have an NDIS package but you are
reluctant to engage their services.
The treating team had also
considered an admission to PARC (prevention and recovery care) that may assist
you to develop skills to
live more independently.
(d) Is there a less restrictive means than a treatment order
that would enable you to receive immediate treatment?
You said you would prefer to stay away from the
treating team. You did not want to take the medication because it caused
and it is not natural. If you had to receive treatment you would
prefer to be treated with vitamins and herbs. You thought that the
made decisions about your mental health treatment were bad people.
were also concerned that the harmful drugs were going into your body that God
created. You believed all psychiatric drugs are
one hundred per cent negative.
You also said that you could not stand the needle as they hurt.
treating team said that you had told them that you only attended appointments
with them, and had the treatment, because you were
on a treatment order.
We have given consideration to the principles, and we acknowledge that
your dignity and autonomy is important and that you should
be supported to
exercise your rights. We understand that you find being subject to compulsory
treatment is very distressing. We also
appreciate that you feel that you are not
being heard. In your written submission and when you spoke to us you made your
You said that you found the treatment order very
restrictive, and we note the principles require that treatment must be provided
the least restriction of your rights and with the aim of promoting your
recovery. At the hearing we discussed with TD whether the
treating team had
taken into account the distress you experienced being on an order, when
providing treatment. She indicated that
the treating team had considered your
distress at being on an order, but they were concerned about the serious risks
if your mental
illness was not treated. We also noted that prior to you
admission in early 2023 the treating team had attempted to treat you more
intensively in the community before admitting you to hospital as this was less
restrictive.
The principles state you should
be supported in making decisions about your treatment including services that
are provided by NDIS
and other treatments such as PARC. We were satisfied that
the treating team was supporting you to make these decisions.
with your mother and she has been the subject of verbal abuse from you when you
were unwell, she is to be supported in her
role in decisions about your
treatment and recovery.
The principles note you are entitled to the
dignity of risk, that is you have the right to take reasonable risks. However,
were to be wholly responsible for decisions about your treatment it
appears that you would cease medication. The risk that you would
relapse, based on what occurred when you stopped taking medication in the past
is high, and in our view, not a reasonable
You are a religious
person, and the diversity principle requires that treatment you are provided
should take into account your diverse
needs. The treating team has not said, and
we do not find, that the fact you are religious means you have a mental illness.
Due to the fact that you would not receive treatment for your mental
illness if you were not on an order, we were satisfied that a
less restrictive
alternative to compulsory treatment was not available, and that this criterion
5. Decision
Given the Tribunal decided that all of the
compulsory treatment criteria applied to you the Tribunal made a treatment
Treatment in hospital or in the community
no suggestion that your treatment could not be provided in the community and so
the Tribunal made a community treatment
Length of the Treatment
The Act sets a maximum duration of six months for treatment

appeared that at this stage you were not able to work together with the treating
team as you did not trust them and thought
they were bad people. You also did
not see any need for any mental health treatment. For these reasons the Tribunal
decided to make
a 26-week order.
Twenty-six weeks is the longest this treatment order can last. Your
treating doctor must revoke your treatment order at any time if
they believe the
treatment criteria no longer apply.
