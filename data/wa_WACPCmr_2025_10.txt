Reasons for

evidence relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for
Is the requested pet a ‘dangerous dog’ as defined in the
The landlord provided Consumer Protection with a copy of a ‘Dangerous Dog
Declaration’ issued by the City of [redacted]
on 2 April 2025.
The declaration states that the requested pet has been declared a
“Dangerous Dog” under
section 33E
Dog Act 1976
This declaration imposes various control requirements on the requested pet,
including that [redacted], [redacted], [redacted] [redacted]
Dog Regulations 2013
The declaration sets out the reasons why the requested pet has been declared a
Dangerous Dog. The reasons are extracted below:
[redacted] has now been involved in 7 attacks on either animals or humans....
[redacted] has dealt with a previous attack and at
the time [redacted]’s
owner stated that [redacted] will/has had [redacted] in training if training has
occurred no benefits
can be seen as [redacted] continues to inflict injury on
[redacted]’s owner has submitted a solution where more training is being
looked into, but this is only reliant on [redacted]
being an integral part of
the solution, [redacted] feels that this may not be sustained.
Previously infringements have been issued but with the level of attacks now
increasing a more direct approach is required to maintain
community safety.
Evidence from the tenant and landlord confirm that the tenant has applied to the
State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia
to revoke the Dangerous Dog
Declaration in relation to the requested pet [redacted] [redacted] [redacted].
The tenant supplied evidence to show that the requested pet is undergoing
training and being assessed by a Dog Behaviourist. This
evidence does not alter
my finding that, at the time of writing this determination, the requested pet is
a declared Dangerous Dog.
Having regard to all of the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the
requested pet is a Dangerous Dog under the
Dog Act 1976
Given that I am satisfied that a ground for refusal applies, the second ground
for refusal (risk to health and safety) will not be
discussed in these reasons
for decision.
A tenant or landlord who is dissatisfied with this decision can appeal to the
Magistrates Court of Western Australia. Appeals must
be lodged within seven days
after receiving this decision, or a later date if leave is granted by the Court.
The appeal can be started by lodging both a
– Appeal Against Registrar’s Decision

with the Magistrates Court online at
