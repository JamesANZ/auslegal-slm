REASONS FOR DECISION – MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS
Issued in accordance with
section 7.36(4)
Motor Accident
Injuries Act
This determination relates to a Miscellaneous Claim, which is a reviewable
decision under Schedule 2, clause 3(k) of the
Motor Accident Injuries Act
(“the Act”), about whether the Insurer is entitled to
refuse payment of the Claimant’s statutory benefits in accordance
(Time for making of claims for statutory benefits).
DOCUMENTS CONSIDERED
have considered the documents provided in the application and the reply. I have
also considered the Claimant’s emails to
me dated 17 September 2020
(1:10pm) and 13 October 2020 (11:28am). I have considered the Insurer’s
written submissions dated
8 October 2020 which deal with the contents of the
Claimant’s email dated 17 September 2020.
LEGISLATION
making my decision I have considered the following legislation and
guidelines:
Accident Injuries Act
Accident Injuries Regulation 2017
Accident Guidelines
Facts not in dispute
following facts are not in dispute:
(a) On 2 June 2020, at about
6pm, the Claimant was involved in a motor accident.
(b) The Claimant lodged a claim with his property insurer, NRMA Insurance,
for the damage to his motorcycle. He did not proceed with
the claim. The
Claimant instead chose to claim compensation for the damage to his motorcycle by
proceeding directly against Allianz
Insurance, who happened to be the other
motorist’s third party property and compulsory third party (CTP)
(c) On 10 July 2020, the Claimant had a telephone conversation with Ms AW
from the Insurer during which he expressed his intention
to lodge a claim for
statutory benefits.
(d) On 13 July 2020, the Claimant emailed to the Insurer his Application for
personal injury benefits dated 13 July 2020 and a Certificate
of Fitness dated
19 June 2020.
(e) By way of letter dated 17 July 2020 from the Insurer, the Claimant was
notified that because his claim had been lodged outside
the 28 day time period
specified in s 6.13(2) of the Act, the Insurer would only make weekly payments
of statutory benefits from
14 July 2020.
(f) On 31 July 2020, the Claimant applied for an internal review of the
Insurer’s decision to refuse payment of his weekly payments
of statutory
benefits from the date of the accident to 13 July 2020.
(g) Upon the internal review being conducted, the Insurer decided that
payments of weekly statutory benefits would commence from 10
July 2020, being
the date when the Insurer said it was ‘notified’ of the claim.
Application of the law to the facts
6.13(2) provides that if a claim for statutory benefits is not made within 28
days after the date of the motor accident, weekly
payments of statutory benefits
are not payable in respect of any period before the claim is made.
6.12(1) provides that a claim for statutory benefits is made by giving notice of
the claim to the relevant insurer under
of the Act. The relevant Insurer
in this case is Allianz Insurance Limited.
6.15(1) provides that notice of a claim is to be given in the manner and
containing the information required by the
Motor Accident
4.23 of the
Motor Accident Guidelines
(in force as at 17 April 2020)
provides that notice of a claim under Division 6.3 of the Act is to be given in
the manner prescribed
by clause 4.23.1 of the
, that is, by
lodging an Application for personal injury benefits either in documentary form
or online. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 set out
the information which must be included in
a notice of claim.
11.5(1)(e) provides that a document that is authorised or required by the Act or
regulations to be served on any person may
be served by email to an email
address specified by the person for the service of documents of that kind.
Section 11.5(4) defines
“serve” as including giving or sending.
certainly understand the Claimant’s grievance, being that within the
28-day time period specified by s 6.13(2) of the Act
Allianz were at least on
notice of a property damage claim. The Claimant has provided an undated email
he sent to the Insurer making
the point that Allianz was the third party
property and CTP insurer of the motorist alleged to be at fault. However, even
email was sent to the Insurer within 28 days after the date of the motor
accident, this unfortunately does not overcome the fact
that notice of the claim
was not given in the manner prescribed by the
Motor Accident Guidelines
within the time period specified in s 6.13(2) of the Act. Notice of the claim
was given on 13 July 2020, when the Claimant emailed
his Application for
personal injury benefits to the Insurer.
Unfortunately
there is no power conferred on me or the Insurer to allow a claim for weekly
payments of statutory benefits for the
time before notice of the claim is given,
when such notice is given outside of the time period in s 6.13(2) of the Act.
It therefore
follows that the Insurer is entitled to refuse payment of weekly
payments of statutory benefits in accordance with s 6.13(2) of the
Act for the
period from 2 June 2020 to when the claim was made, which was in fact 13 July
2020. The Insurer has decided that payments
of weekly payments of statutory
benefits will be made from 10 July 2020. I will not disturb the Insurer’s
the Claimant was self-represented, he is not entitled to legal
