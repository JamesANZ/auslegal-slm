On 13 June 2008 the Attorney-General issued to the National Alternative
Dispute Resolution Advisory Council a reference asking that
it inquire into and
identify strategies for removing barriers to and providing incentives for the
use of alternative dispute resolution
instead of civil proceedings and during
court and tribunal processes. The Attorney-General has also asked for advice on
initiatives
government might take to support the recommended strategies,
including legislative action.
On 26 March 2009 the Advisory Council released its issues paper,
the Civil Justice System
. It subsequently received over 60 submissions and
held extensive consultations with a variety of interested parties in Sydney,
and Canberra.
On 4 November 2009 the Attorney-General launched the Advisory Council’s
report on alternative dispute resolution in the civil
justice system,
Resolve to Resolve—embracing ADR to improve access to justice in the
federal jurisdiction
report contains 39 recommendations aimed at encouraging greater use of ADR in
civil proceedings, including the following:
• a legislative obligation on prospective litigants to take genuine steps
to resolve disputes before they go to court
• developing and widely promulgating a National Alternative Dispute
Resolution Protocol to promote the consistent application
of ADR principles and
• requiring lawyers and the courts to provide appropriate information or
advice in relation to ADR processes
• developing a standards framework for advisory ADR
processes—similar to the framework that was developed for mediators
National Mediator Accreditation System, or NMAS)
• developing judicial case management courses focusing on ways in which
judges can identify matters suitable for referral to
ADR and suitable ADR
techniques and mechanisms
• supporting the development of accessible and effective
community‑based and private ADR services
• providing a model dispute resolution clause as a template that can be
voluntarily adopted in contractual documents
• requiring Commonwealth agencies to include dispute resolution clauses in
• improving data collection, evaluation and research in the federal civil
justice system to ensure that future ADR policy is
built on a strong evidence
The Commonwealth Government has already adopted a number of the recommendations
put forward by National Alternative Dispute Resolution
Advisory Council. In
December 2009 the Attorney-General asked NADRAC to undertake three new
references. These are to develop a statement
of national ADR principles and a
supporting guide, to provide advice on legislative changes required to protect
the integrity of
various ADR processes, and to develop a model dispute
management plan for Commonwealth agencies.
In May 2009 the New South Wales Government released the discussion paper
ADR Blueprint
. From this blueprint the Government has released two of
several proposed ADR blueprint draft recommendations reports. The first proposes
that people be required to take all reasonable steps to resolve their disputes
without going to court. The second deals with ADR
in government and states that
there are three main strategies for developing a less litigious culture in New
South Wales:
• encouraging people to use other suitable dispute resolution
• changing the culture of the legal profession, so that it becomes less
focused on running cases and more focused on solving
• structuring the civil justice system so that, when litigation is
contemplated or begun, the way the system works increases
the likelihood that
the dispute will be settled quickly.
In August 2009 the
Government released
ADR Blueprint Draft Recommendations 1: pre-action
. The report contains four recommendations: that the Civil
Procedure Act be extended to pre-action conduct; that a guide for people
civil disputes be developed; that pre-action protocols for introduction in
family provision disputes be developed and other types
of disputes amenable to
pre-action protocols be identified; and that courts and tribunals review their
rules and practice notes to
ensure that ADR is considered as early as
In September 2009 the Government released
ADR Blueprint Draft
Recommendations Report 2: ADR in government
. Among the report’s draft
recommendations are that the Model Litigant Policy be strengthened to give
greater emphasis to the
role of ADR in resolving civil claims and litigation,
that the Government prepare an annual public report on its use of ADR, and
ADR clauses be included in all appropriate government contracts.

On 6 May 2009 the Victorian Parliament’s Law Reform Committee released
a report proposing future directions for alternative
dispute resolution and
restorative justice in Victoria.
The report contains 44 recommendations designed to realise the potential of ADR
services in Victoria, ensure
high-quality services, and make ADR accessible to all members of the
community. Among the committee’s recommendations are the
• that barriers to access for members of the community be
reduced—including by establishing more dispute settlement centres
throughout the state, providing more assistance for people from
non–English speaking backgrounds and developing culturally
appropriate
• that Victorians’ capacity to resolve civil disputes themselves be
augmented through education in conflict resolution
and communication skills
• that the supply of ADR services be
particularly by exploring the scope for
additional industry ombudsman schemes and by conducting research into the
potential for using
online ADR.
The committee’s report
contains 34 recommendations aimed at improving current restorative justice
programs and making restorative
justice more widely available in Victoria. Among
other things, the recommendations concern the following:
• improving the experiences of victims participating in the Youth Justice
Group Conferencing Program, a restorative justice
program operating in the
Children’s Court of Victoria, through increased provision of information
and support to victims and
more follow-up with victims after a group conference
• increasing the quality and consistency of restorative justice services
through the training and accreditation of service
• expanding restorative justice programs, including a staged roll-out of
such programs to suitable adult offenders, a pilot
program using restorative
justice for some more serious offences (but not for family violence and sexual
offences) and a trial restorative
justice program for suitable offenders after
they have been sentenced by a court.

On 28 May 2008 the Victorian Law Reform Commission released a report on its
inquiry into the civil justice
The terms of reference
required the commission to undertake a number of tasks, including identification
of the goals of the civil
justice system and the principles that should guide
the rules of civil procedure. The commission was also asked to identify the key
factors that influence the operation of the civil justice system, including
matters affecting the timeliness, cost and complexity
of litigation.
The report made 177 recommendations with a view to making civil litigation in
Victoria cheaper, simpler and fairer. It recommended
increasing ADR resolution
through greater use of an increased array of options for ADR, more effective use
of industry dispute resolution
schemes and additional provisions for mandatory
referral to ADR.
