Indigenous Pre-Law Program at UNSW
The Aboriginal Education Program at the University of New South Wales held
its 3rd Indigenous Pre-Law Program at the Law School at
UNSW between 6 January
and 7 February 1997.
The course was specifically designed to assist Indigenous people to prepare
for the rigours of law school. Subjects covered over the
intense period included
Indigenous legal issues, contracts, academic skills and legal systems.
Practical elements were included in the course, such as a visit to the High
Court and Parliament House in Canberra culminating in
a meeting with Mr Justice
Michael Kirby. The students also met Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Affairs, Senator
John Herron, and his Opposition counterpart, Mr Daryl
Twenty people enrolled in the course, nineteen of whom graduated. Thirteen
offers were made to study at UNSW Law School, while other
students returned to
their home States to pursue studies there.
The next issue of this publication will have a special focus on the
judgment. It will also be the first issue of the
Indigenous Law
as we are changing our name to better reflect the diversity of
Indigenous identity in Australia. So hang onto this issue; who knows,
Aboriginal Law Bulletin
ever, it may be worth a fortune at
Christie's some day! The Aboriginal Law Centre, our publisher, will also soon be
changing its
name to the Indigenous Law Centre.
First Nations' International Court of
The First Nations' International Court of justice has announced that it has
postponed its first sitting. This sitting was originally
scheduled for February
1997. The Court had its inaugural sitting in Ottawa in April 1996, when
Indigenous judges from Australia,
Aoteoroa/New Zealand, and North America met
together to consider whether to hear allegations against Canada in
Nations of Turtle Island v Her Majesty in Right of Canad
a. Evidence on a
number of counts was to have been presented at the February sitting. (See 'First
Nations International Court of Justice:
A Time to Begin' by one of the
Australian judges, Irene Watson, in Vol 3,
Aboriginal Law Bulletin
for a report on the Court's preliminary hearings.)
A spokesperson for the Court stated the delay is attributed to need for
further fundraising. The First Nations' International Court
of Justice depends
entirely on donations from individuals and organisations. Although it has
already received widespread support,
it is counting on raising greater revenue
through the sale of resource materials, including transcripts and video
recordings of the
historic first sitting.
Mr Ralph Keesickquayash, the Court's Registrar, said that the testimony and
preliminary judgments should be of great interest to advocates
of Indigenous
peoples and to academics. He said that no other forum could give the perspective
on the legal and political relationships
of Indigenous peoples and the Canadian
government that this one can give.
The establishment of such Indigenous justice mechanisms is supported by the
recently-released report of the Canadian Royal Commission
of Aboriginal People,
which refers to judicial powers and authority as a core area of governance.
Ontario Regional Chief Gordon Peters
stated that until Indigenous peoples can
establish an international justice forum independent of colonising powers, they
would never
be able to bring those powers to account for the violations of
human, treaty and international rights that they have committed.
Organisers are hopeful that with sufficient monies raised during the year,
the Court will be able to commence sitting later in 1997.
