Judgment of:
ALSTERGREN CJ, STRICKLAND & KENT
Date of judgment:
Catchwords:
– LEAVE TO APPEAL –
APPEAL – DECLARATION – Whether leave to appeal from a declaration is
Whether a declaration of a finding of fact is interlocutory or
final – Whether the primary judge finally determined the rights
the parties – Where the primary judge made clear that she was not yet
dealing with the wife’s applications pursuant
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) – Where the declaration does not
finally determine the rights of the parties – Where the order, although
in declaratory terms, is more akin to a finding of fact – Where
leave to appeal is required.
DECLARATION – Where the primary judge made a declaration that a
document was not executed on the date
that it bears – Whether findings of
fact open on the evidence – Whether delay weakens the
primary judge’s advantage
in having seen the oral and documentary
evidence unfold in a coherent manner – Whether the findings are
“glaringly improbable”
or “contrary to compelling
inferences” – Where the primary judge undertook a detailed
consideration of her impressions
of the credit of the central witnesses in the
case – Where any factual findings had an evidentiary foundation –
there was sufficient factual evidence to persuade the primary judge that
the document was not executed on the date it bears.
– LEAVE TO APPEAL – APPEAL – DISQUALIFICATION – Whether
leave to appeal from dismissal of a disqualification
application is required
– Whether “decree or decision” is interlocutory or final
– Where a decision by a
judge in civil proceedings to refuse an
application to disqualify themselves does not finally determine the rights of
the parties
– Where dismissal of a disqualification application is
interlocutory – Where leave to appeal is required – Where
decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered and
substantial injustice would result if leave were
– APPEAL – DISQUALIFICATION – Apprehended bias –
Whether the primary judge misapplied the test of apprehended
Whether the primary judge focused on whether the fair-minded lay observer
would have agreed with the primary judge’s
adverse findings rather
than what that observer might reasonably apprehend – Where the
primary judge made findings of credit
and fraud – Where the
primary judge’s approach reflects an error in the application of the
– APPEAL – DISQUALIFICATION –
Waiver – Where the appellants sought to have the finding of fact in
to the document determined as a preliminary issue – Whether the
appellants waived their right to seek that the primary judge
recuse herself
– Where no party raised waiver as an applicable exception to apprehended
bias before the primary judge –
Where the authorities make it clear
that the doctrine of waiver depends upon a litigant being fully aware of the
circumstances in
which apprehended bias might be inferred.

Family Law Act 1975
REASONS FOR
ALSTERGREN CJ, STRICKLAND & KENT JJ:
1 Within a broader dispute, the parties to this appeal joined issue as to
whether a Deed of Declaration of Trust (“DODT”)
was a fraud, having
been created some years after the date it bears (28 February 2002), or whether
it was in fact executed by the
late Mr Jess Snr
(“the husband”) on that date. The operative effect of the DODT
was to divest the husband of substantial
property interests in favour of his son
Mr Jess Jnr.
2 The essential contention of Ms Jess (“the wife”) in the
proceedings was that the DODT was a fraudulent document created
to deprive her
of her legitimate property settlement entitlement.
3 The primary judge resolved to determine the issue as to the
authenticity of the DODT as a discrete issue in advance of determining
substantive property claims of the wife.
4 On 4 December 2018 the primary judge delivered extensive reasons for
judgment (“the 2018 reasons”) recording numerous
findings including findings to the effect that the DODT is a fraudulent
document. However the primary judge did not then
make any substantive
orders, adjourning the proceedings for further directions. Ultimately on
15 November 2019 the primary judge
delivered further reasons for
judgment (“the 2019 reasons”) and made the orders the
subject of these proceedings.
5 On 15 November 2019 the primary judge made a
declaration that the DODT dated 28 February 2002 was not executed on
the date that
it bears (Order 2). The primary judge further ordered the
dismissal of an application that the primary judge recuse herself from
further involvement in determining the proceedings (Order 4).
6 By Notice of Appeal filed on 13 December 2019 the parties listed as
appellants in the schedule attached to the Notice of Appeal
seek leave to appeal
from Order 2 and to appeal from Order 4. These parties are conveniently
referred to collectively as either “the
appellants” or
“the represented third parties”, as that is how they are
referred to by the primary judge. As will
shortly be discussed the
appellants’ position in relation to whether leave to appeal is required
altered just prior to the
hearing of the appeal. Whilst the Notice of Appeal
contends for orders on appeal including an order that this Court declare that
the DODT was executed on 28 February 2002, Queen’s Counsel for
the appellants confirmed in final submissions on the hearing
of the appeal that
the orders sought on appeal were confined to setting aside the orders of the
primary judge.
7 The application for leave to appeal, if leave be required, and the appeal,
is opposed by,
, the wife and the trustees of the bankrupt
estate of the husband (“the third respondent”).
8 The third respondent did not participate in the trial but became active as
an intervening party once the primary judge had delivered
the 2018 reasons.
The third respondent participated in the proceedings for the purpose of the
primary judge delivering the 2019 reasons.
The third respondent filed
a Notice of Contention on 3 January 2020 with respect to the
primary judge’s dismissal of the recusal
application.
9 For the reasons which follow we are not persuaded of any merit in the
appellants’ complaints on appeal concerning Order 2
of the orders made on
15 November 2019. It follows that the application for leave to appeal from that
order is dismissed. We are,
however, persuaded of merit in the complaint that
the primary judge ought to have recused herself. It follows that the
should be granted leave to appeal (we have determined that leave is
required) from Order 4 of the orders made on 15 November 2019
and that order be
set aside. It also follows that an order should be made that the
primary judge is disqualified from the further
hearing of this
proceeding.
IS LEAVE TO APPEAL THE DECLARATORY ORDER REQUIRED?
10 As mentioned at the commencement of these
reasons, the appellants’ position in relation to whether leave to appeal
is required
altered just prior to the hearing of the appeal. The appellants
filed an Outline of Submissions on 12 October 2020 contending that
declaration is a final order which finally determined the rights of the parties
in relation to the DODT, and thus leave to appeal
is not required.
11 The wife and the third respondent contend that leave to appeal is required
to appeal the declaratory order. The third respondent’s
submissions
aligned with those of the wife’s in relation to leave to appeal, and so we
only need advert to the submissions
of the wife.
12 The appellants relied upon various authorities for the proposition that a
declaratory order cannot be an interlocutory order as
it declares the rights of
the parties as to an issue (see
Warramunda Village Inc v Pryde
(2002) 116 FCR 58 (“
Insurance Australia
Limited t/as NRMA Insurance v Iuli & Anor
[2014] ACTCA 50
Formwork Services Pty Ltd v Moir (No 2)
[2020] ACTCA 44
(2020) 356 FLR 111).
appellants made specific reference to the following passage from
, where Finkelstein J opined:
68. ... An order of a court is either final or
interlocutory:
Standard Discount Co v Otard de la Grange
[1877] UKLawRpCP 58
(1877) 3 CPD 67
at 69 per Bramwell LJ. Thus if an order is not interlocutory it must be final
and, conversely, if it is final it cannot be interlocutory.
According to
existing law the only declaration that may be granted is a final and conclusive
declaration:
Inland Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster Limited
[1979] UKHL 5
at 1014 per Lord Diplock, 1027 per Lord Scarman;
Clarke v Chadburn
[1985] 1 WLR 78
at 81 per Megarry VC. The reason for this is that a declaration
declares the rights of parties and it would be illogical for a court
that a person has certain rights on one day and different rights on the next.
Put another way, an interlocutory declaration
is an inherently contradictory
International General Electric Co of New York Ltd v Commissioners of
Customs and Excise
[1962] Ch 784.
Accordingly, a declaration must produce a
state of finality in relation to a particular issue, whether or not there are
other issues
in the case that still require resolution by a final
13 However, Queen’s Counsel for the wife urged us to consider not just
that passage, but the surrounding paragraphs of the judgment
of Finkelstein J,
including the following:
66. I need to qualify the generality of the foregoing
propositions. Before any order of a court, including a declaratory judgment,
operate in law either as a res judicata or an issue estoppel, certain well known
requirements must be satisfied. One of those
requirements is that the judgment
must be final. This does not mean that the judgment must be final as distinct
from interlocutory,
a distinction to which I will return shortly. The
requirement is that the judgment should be “final and conclusive on the
Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2)
[1967] AC 853 at 935. So, in a case that involves a number of specific issues
and one of those issues is tried before the others,
the judgment on that issue,
though an interlocutory judgment, will result in “the
primary judge’s hand [being] tied in
respect of all matters of fact
and law involved in that determination”:
Bass v Permanent Trustee Co
[1999] HCA 9
(1999) 198 CLR 334
at 360, citing
Fidelitas Shipping Co Ltd v
V/O Exportchleb
[1966] 1 QB 630
at 642 where Diplock LJ said:
“Where the issue separately determined is not decisive of the suit, the
judgment upon that issue is an interlocutory judgment
and the suit continues.
Yet I take it to be too clear to need citation of authority that the parties to
the suit are bound by the
determination of the issue. They cannot subsequently
in the same suit advance argument or adduce further evidence directed to showing
that the issue was wrongly determined. Their only remedy is by way of appeal
from the interlocutory judgment and, where appropriate,
an application to the
appellate court to adduce further evidence.”
67. The requirement of finality makes it necessary to determine the status of a
declaratory judgment given before the final disposition
of a case, for example
when there is a “split trial” and questions of liability are tried
before any issue as to damages.
There are a number of authorities which have
held that a declaration granted at the conclusion of a trial on liability, is an
interlocutory
order: see, for example,
Australian Builders’
Labourers’ Federated Union of Workers – Western Australian Branch v
J-Corp Pty Ltd
[1993] FCA 266
(1993) 42 FCR 452
Fisher & Paykel Healthcare
Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd
(1991) 103 ALR 239 at 242;
[1993] FCA 611
(1993) 119 ALR 215
NZI Securities Australia Ltd v
[1994] FCA 1219
(1994) 51 FCR 584
at 593-594;
Fraser v NRMA Holdings Limited
(1995) 55 FCR 452
at 457. (In none of these cases was it suggested that a
declaration should not have been granted at the conclusion of the hearing.
leave to appeal was given, on the appeal the dispute was considered on the
substantive merits.)
69. For all this, I must concede that I feel myself overwhelmed by the weight of
the many Full Court decisions that are to the contrary
effect. In addition to
the cases that I have already mentioned, more keep piling up. I have discovered
another decision of the Full
Court holding that a declaration made at the end of
the first part of a “split case” is interlocutory. The case is
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Employment Advocate
[2001] FCA 1442
, which was handed down only four months ago. There is no point
in criticising those cases on the basis that they do not mention the
contradiction I see as inherent in a finding that a declaratory judgment is
interlocutory. The position is that the Full Court has
laid down the law and I
am bound to follow it, right or wrong.
70. In any event, there may be a middle ground. The answer may be that a
judgment may be interlocutory for some purposes and final
for others. Cases such
Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd
Joseph Lynch Land
Co Ltd v Lynch
[1995] 1 NZLR 37
have held that an issue may be finally
determined in what are interlocutory proceedings so that an issue estoppel will
arise. According
to these cases the question to be asked is whether in the
circumstances of a particular case it is reasonable to regard the earlier
decision as a final determination of the issue that one of the parties wishes to
raise again:
Makhoul v Barnes
(1995) 60 FCR 572.
Telecommunications Corporation v Barnes
[1996] QCA 1
(1995) 125 FLR
where the Queensland Court of Appeal held that a declaratory judgment made
after a hearing on liability finally determined some of
the issues in the action
but was not a final judgment for the purposes of the appeal provisions. While
this approach is certainly
a satisfactory method of determining whether a
decision is final for the purposes of res judicata or issue estoppel (a point
seems to me to raise somewhat different issues), I am not persuaded that
it can be said that a declaration is interlocutory for any
purpose. I repeat
that if it be correct that a declaration is necessarily a final order, I cannot
see on what basis it can be treated
as interlocutory for some purposes. I favour
the view that once an order has been characterised as either a final order or an
interlocutory
order, it will retain that character for all purposes. Put another
way, I do not accept the notion that is inherent in the proposition
declaration may be interlocutory, namely that it can begin life as an
interlocutory order and later transform itself into
a final order. An order of
the court is not like a caterpillar which, through a process of metamorphosis,
becomes a butterfly.
14 The wife submits that, when properly construed and considered in the
context in which it was made, the declaratory order was not
a declaration in the
sense referred to in the authorities upon which the appellants rely. It is
contended that the primary judge
did no more than formally record her
finding of fact in the nature of a declaration, which was the course sought by
the appellants
after the delivery of the 2018 reasons, and her Honour does not,
and does not purport to deal with, the rights of the parties. The
fact that the
primary judge did not intend to declare the rights of the parties is made
clear by her Honour stating that she was
not yet dealing with the wife’s
applications pursuant to
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“the Act”), and that the “represented third
parties’ “interests” are not at risk or in
need of protection
unless, or until, the Court starts to deal with the wife’s s 79 and
of the Act applications” (at [27] of the 2018 reasons). Her Honour goes on
to say that it was “out of an abundance of
caution and the declining
health of the husband that the represented third parties have participated fully
in the proceedings”
thus far (at [28] of the 2018 reasons).
15 In those circumstances, we agree with the wife’s submissions in that
the order, although expressed in declaratory terms,
is less akin to cases
involving declarations as to rights and more akin to appeals involving findings
of fact (see
Brott and Joachim
[2001] FamCA 244
(2001) FLC 93-071
Brott and Joachim”
)). The Full Court of the
Family Court in
Brott and Joachim
held that leave to appeal was required
to appeal from an interlocutory finding before the final judgment was determined
in relation
to setting aside a costs agreement. Relevantly to this case,
their Honours said the following about appealing interlocutory findings
33. In our view, the matters complained of by the
applicant do not at this stage merit a grant of leave to appeal. Any error of
trial Judge in respect of her conclusion as to the existence or otherwise of
a signed costs agreement and as to whether or not such
an agreement should be
set aside will be capable of being dealt with on an appeal from any substantive
order made by the trial Judge
at the conclusion of the proceedings. At this
stage there is no indication one way of [sic] the other as to whether or not Mr
will be allowed to rely upon the agreement. Her Honour may well dismiss
the application to set the agreement aside, having regard
to all of the
surrounding circumstances of the case. It is merely speculative to assume that
because her Honour has made a finding
that there is a preliminary bar to
allowing Mr Brott to rely on the agreement, namely a finding that he had not
signed it at what
she perceived to be the relevant time, such a finding will
necessarily lead to the agreement being set aside.
We do not perceive that
the hardship that Mr Brott will have to undergo to deal with the discretion
issue is such that merits the
respondent being obliged to undertake exactly the
very evil that the Court spoke of in
Re the Will of FB Gilbert
namely that the disposal of a case can be delayed interminably and costs seeped
up indefinitely in challenging each exercise
of discretion in an interlocutory
application
34. In determining this issue we are not seeking to draw any conclusions about
the validity of the matters complained about by Mr
Brott in his proposed Notice
of Appeal nor in his submissions. We make no ruling whatsoever on whether or not
her Honour erred in
finding that the agreement had been signed by Mr Brott a
short time prior to the hearing. We make no finding on whether or not the
correspondence surrounding the Agreement can be looked at as providing the
necessary signature for the purposes of the
Family Law Rules
. We make no finding
on who bears the onus of proof in respect of whether or not the costs agreement
should be set aside in the event
that there has been non-compliance with O 38
sub-r 27(2), (3) and (4). We do not conclude, however, that Mr Brott will suffer
prejudice or hardship as to make it appropriate at this stage to interfere
with the process that her Honour is undertaking in determining
whether or not to
grant the application of the wife, namely to set the costs agreement aside.
It is our view that the proceedings should run to its natural conclusion by
her Honour determining whether or not to exercise her
discretion before it is
appropriate that there be an appellate review of the outcome

”), the High Court of Australia (“the
High Court”) was concerned with whether the judgment was final or
interlocutory,
after some of the issues in the case had not yet been determined,
whilst others had. The High Court held at 767-768 (per Gibbs CJ,
Murphy & Wilson JJ agreed):
The test for determining whether a judgment is final,
which has been laid down in a number of cases including
Carr v. Finance
Corporation of Australia Ltd (No 1)
[1981] HCA 20
(1981) 147 CLR 246
whether the judgment finally determines the rights of the parties, and the
authorities have held that the court in applying the
test must have regard to
the legal rather than the practical effect of the judgment. So that the question
in the present case is
whether the whole judgment finally determined, in a legal
sense, all the rights of the parties that were at issue in these proceedings.
And the answer is, plainly, that it did not, because it left undetermined the
question whether any, and what, damages were payable.
The conclusion that the
judgment is not a final judgment is supported by a short passage from the
judgment of Dixon CJ in
John Grant & Sons Ltd v Trocadero Building and
Investment Co Ltd
[1938] HCA 20
(1938) 60 CLR 1
at 35, where his Honour said:-
“The judgment of the Supreme Court did not determine the action, for the
demurrers did not affect pleas to or replications
in relation to all counts of
the declaration. The judgment was, therefore, interlocutory, and this appeal did
not lie without leave.”
17 The wife submits that the principle from
Computer Edge
, namely that
a judgment is interlocutory in nature for the purpose of the requirement of
leave to appeal if the proceeding is continuing
regardless of whether the
particular order made is itself final in nature, has been applied in numerous
subsequent authorities of
the Full Court of the Federal Court involving
declarations made prior to the conclusion of proceedings (see
Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (WA) v J-Corp Pty Ltd
114 ALR 551;
Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion
Engineering Pty Ltd
(1991) 103 ALR 239;
Caboche & Bond v Ramsay
[1993] FCA 611
(1993) 119 ALR 215
NZI Securities Australia Ltd v Poignand
[1994] FCA 1219
Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd
(1995) 127 ALR 543).
18 We also refer to the decision in
Construction, Forestry, Mining &
Energy Union v Employment Advocate
[2001] FCA 1442
, where the
trial judge made declarations that the relevant legislation under the
Workplace Relations Act 1996
(Cth) had been contravened and then
adjourned the further hearing as to penalties. An appeal was brought against the
declarations,
and in determining whether they required leave to be appealed
from, the Full Court of the Federal Court held the following:
6. ... For the purpose of any proceeding under Division
6 of the Act for an order or orders under s 298U, a mere finding that a person
has engaged in conduct in contravention of
- and any consequential
declaration to that effect - can only be characterised as a step along the way
to finally disposing of the
rights of the parties. Given that the award of
relief under s 298U is discretionary and that the trial judge in this matter has
determined that penalties are to be imposed, the trial judge cannot be said
to have as yet determined whether any order would be
made under s 298U.
7. It is unnecessary here to consider in any detail the differentiating
characteristics of orders that are final and those that are
interlocutory for
the purposes of the leave requirement imposed by
Court of Australia Act
; but see eg the discussion in
[1999] FCA 284
(1999) 86 FCR 134.
It is sufficient to say that an order will be
final for the purposes of an appeal when, even though interlocutory in form, it
final in substance in that it finally disposes of the rights of the parties:
Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd
[2000] FCA 1572

French Caledonia Travel Service Pty Ltd (t/a Connection Holidays) v
, unreported, FCA, Full Court, 22 May 1992: Williams, Civil Procedure
Victoria, I 64.01.455.
8. In the present matter, while the making of a finding of contravening conduct
was a necessary precondition for the grant of relief
under s 298U, such a
finding even when expressed in a declaration (as here) did not of itself
determine any liability of that conduct
to any of the forms of relief specified
in the section. It “left undetermined the question whether any, and what
[penalties]
were payable”:
Computer Edge Pty Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
[1984] HCA 47
(1984) 54 ALR 767
at 768. It was not equivalent to an order awarding
penalties “to be assessed”: cf
Hall v Busst
[1960] HCA 84
(1960) 104 CLR
at 218; and see generally on this distinction
National Australia Bank Ltd
v Maher (No 2),
above, at 592-595.
9. The declaratory orders made were clearly interlocutory in character: see
Australian Builders’ Labourers’ Federated Union of Workers -
Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Ltd
[1993] FCA 266
(1993) 42 FCR 452
at 454. Leave
to appeal is required.
19 Having found that leave was necessary, the Full Court of the Federal Court
went on to refuse leave to appeal, and for reasons which
the wife says are
analogous to the present appeal, as follows:
12. ... Other than to observe that the present
applicants...are attempting to undertake the forbidding task of challenging what
be considered to be careful fact findings made in a setting of adverse
findings on credibility, we refrain for the reasons we give
expressing any view on whether any doubt attends the trial judge's decision.
15. It was, in a sense, fortuitous that the trial judge proceeded actually to
make orders (rather than to foreshadow orders to be
made) in advance of
determining the question of penalties. It was this that provided the opportunity
to institute the present “appeal”...
16. The consequences of the present applicants having sought to appeal prior to
that determination are several. First, it interrupted
the orderly and planned
resolution of the matter in the manner foreshadowed by the trial judge and
apparently acquiesced in by the
parties; secondly, it effected no potentially
significant saving in costs given that no evidence was to be called on the
issue; and, thirdly, it had the potential to fragment the appellate
process itself in that, if leave was granted but the appeal was
dismissed, a
further appeal could be brought contesting any penalty later imposed. Such
further appeal would be as of right as the
order imposing penalties would
ordinarily be a final order.
17. It is well accepted practice in the case of appeals in criminal matters
that, exceptional cases apart, all considerations of
convenience point to the
Court entertaining an application for leave to appeal against conviction only
after sentence has been passed...
18. Though the present is not a criminal matter, it is in our view sufficiently
analogous in the circumstances in relation to the
issue of leave to appeal as to
warrant the adoption of a like approach for like reasons of convenience to those
given by McInerney
J. There was, in addition, no significant advantage to be
secured, or detriment to be averted, in seeking to appeal prior to (rather
after) the making of an order on penalties.
The course taken disrupted the
intended finalisation of the matter. The foreshadowed appeal itself raised no
issues of general importance.
As we have noted, the challenge is to findings of
fact and this in a setting where adverse credibility findings affected some of
those findings. Even were we to assume that the trial judge’s
decision was wrong, no substantial injustice to the unions and
concerned would result. They will remain able to appeal at the usual and proper
time, ie when final orders are made on
the determination of penalties
19. The course that has been taken by the applicants is
not one to be
. We would refuse leave to appeal.
(Emphasis added)
20 The wife relies upon further State Court authority for the proposition
that, although declarations may be seen as final in their
effect of a particular
issue, they can nonetheless be interlocutory for the purposes of appeal
provisions (see
Kinsella v Gold Coast City Council
[2014] QSC 65
Barnes v Australian Telecommunications Corporation
[1996] QCA 1
[1996] 2 Qd R 1).
21 We agree with that proposition.
22 Lastly, as contended for by the wife, the appellants’ presentation
of their case at first instance before the primary judge
in relation to the
requirement for leave to appeal was contrary to their position on appeal, and as
a result, they should be precluded
from now raising on appeal that leave is not
Metwally v University of Wollongong
(1985) 60 ALR 68
23 The wife objected to the appellants’ application for the
primary judge to express her finding of fact as a declaratory order
of the very reason that it would provide the appellants with a vehicle to
further delay the substantive case with an interlocutory
appeal (at [20] and
[25] of the 2019 reasons). Her Honour acknowledged this at the hearing on 6 June
2019, but suggested that the
appellants would require leave to appeal and that
the concerns raised by the wife could properly be made to the Full Court of the
Family Court (see Transcript 6 June 2019, p.7
lines 1–20; and at
[26] of the 2019 reasons). Queen’s Counsel for the appellants expressly
adopted that course in urging
her Honour to make the declaration and stated that
“whether or not we obtain leave to appeal is a question for another court
at another time” (Transcript 6 June 2019, p.7 lines 16–17). As such,
it is contended that her Honour’s decision
in making the declaratory order
over the objection of the wife was expressly based in part on the operation of
the leave requirements
in the appeal court and an expectation engendered by
Queen’s Counsel for the appellants that the requirement of leave to appeal
would operate as a safeguard to ensure the wife’s concerns were properly
24 As a result of the above, we find that leave to appeal the declaratory
order is required.
25 The husband was a business identity who achieved
notoriety for his chain of businesses trading as Y Business. The husband passed
away in 2018 aged 88 years.
26 The husband and the wife separated in 2006 after 18 years of marriage and
20 years of cohabitation. Their relationship produced
three now adult
27 Mr Jess Jnr is the husband’s son from an earlier
relationship with Ms D Jess. Ms C Jess is
Mr Jess Jnr’s wife. Mr Ban
is a director of X Corporation
Pty Ltd (“XC”). Each of Mr Jess Jnr and
Ms C Jess and Mr Ban were central witnesses in
the proceedings before
the primary judge and each are parties to the proceedings.
28 Following the 2006 separation, on 18 December 2006 the wife commenced
property settlement proceedings pursuant to s 79 of the Act
against the husband
(“the first family law proceedings”).
29 In 1983 a unit trust known as the Y Unit Trust (“the YUT”) had
been established by the husband with the company which
became known as XC as
trustee. Within the YUT was held the relevant corporate and business interests
of what may conveniently be
referred to as “the X business”. When
the wife commenced the first family law proceedings XC was being operated by the
husband in conjunction with Mr Jess Jnr as chief executive
officer (“CEO”) and Mr Ban as a director. The wife’s
application for property settlement contemplated that the assets of the XC/YUT,
the X business, would form part of the property interests
to be considered in
the s 79 proceedings.
30 However on 30 March 2007, some three months after the wife had instituted
the s 79 proceedings, the husband alleged that all of
his previous
interests in the YUT had passed to Mr Jess Jnr pursuant to the terms
of the DODT bearing an execution date of 28 February
2002. Broadly stated,
clause 6 of the DODT provided that if Mr Jess Jnr as CEO caused XC to
achieve, as determined in its Management
accounts, earnings before interest and
tax (“EBIT”) of in excess of $10 million in any financial year
within seven years
of the date of the DODT, the trust interest would vest in
Mr Jess Jnr. The husband contended that such triggering event had
in the 2006 financial year with the consequence that his previously
held interests in the YUT via his unitholding had vested in
Jess Jnr. On that contention those interests, the X business, did
not form part of the husband’s property interests for the
purpose of the
first family law proceedings.
31 It may be interpolated here that the substantial rationale for the DODT
was contended by Mr Jess Jnr to be Mr Jess Jnr having the
future expectation of entitlements as provided for in the DODT on the basis of
trading XC and the X business out of serious financial
difficulties as CEO. In
this context a precursor to the DODT was said to be a 2 February 2002 letter
Mr Jess Jnr had written to the
husband seeking to establish
Mr Jess Jnr’s security and future entitlements to XC if he was
to devote himself to the business.
This letter became known and referred to in
the proceedings as “the Dear Dadda letter” and was
characterised as being
contemporaneous with, and corroborative of, the
authenticity of the DODT.
32 On 24 July 2007 Mr Jess Jnr instituted proceedings in the
Supreme Court of Victoria seeking declaratory relief against the husband,
wife and others to the effect that his entitlement under the DODT had vested and
that he was thus entitled to be registered as
the holder of the husband’s
units in the YUT (“the trust proceedings”). The wife was the only
party who opposed
the relief sought by Mr Jess Jnr in the trust
proceedings.
33 In the event, the trust proceedings and the first family law proceedings
were resolved by agreement of all parties in September
2009. The parties to the
trust proceedings entered into a Deed of Settlement on 20 September 2009
(“the Deed of Settlement”)
and agreed to discontinue those
proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Final property settlement
orders, as between the husband
and the wife, were made in the Family Court of
Australia on 24 September 2009 (“the consent orders”) and the
and the wife entered into a Binding Financial Agreement on 20 September
2009 (“the BFA”). The wife received certain property
and some $17
million in assets.
34 The DODT was implemented in favour of Mr Jess Jnr. When the
terms of the DODT were disclosed to the Australian Taxation Office
ATO”) it triggered a taxation liability for the husband initially claimed,
in March 2009, at $53 million but later
rising to a claim in the order of
$92 million.
35 The husband was admitted to hospital twice in May 2010. In late May 2010
the husband told his daughter that he wanted to see the
wife urgently. On 31 May
2010 the husband allegedly confessed to the wife to certain wrongdoing in the
course of the first family
law proceedings. The wrongdoing included his
participation in duping the wife with respect to the DODT which the husband then
was a fraudulent document brought into existence well after the date it
36 In September 2012 the wife returned to live in the husband’s home as
his carer. On 16 April 2014 the wife instituted, by
an Amended Initiating
Application, the current proceedings pursuant to s 79A of the Act. In summary,
by these proceedings the wife
seeks to set aside the consent orders for property
settlement and the Deed of Settlement from the trust proceedings, with the
that any determination of her further final alteration of property
interests could affect assets and financial interests relevant
to the trust
proceedings and which have been held or are now held by,
Mr Jess Jnr and other third parties in the substantive
proceedings.
37 The wife’s Amended Initiating Application filed on 16 April 2014
seeks that pursuant to s 79A(1)(a) of the Act:
(a) The consent order be set aside on the basis that a
miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of fraud and the giving of false
evidence by the husband; and
(b) An order for property adjustment as between the husband and the wife under s
79 of the Act in substitution for the consent order
having regard to the
husband’s property interests consequential upon the setting aside or
rendering nugatory of the consent
order, the Deed of Settlement, the DODT
purportedly made on 28 February 2002, and the BFA.
38 The wife also seeks orders pursuant to s 106B of the Act to set aside the
DODT or to have it declared a sham and further, pursuant
to s 90K(1) of the Act,
that the BFA entered into as part of the settlement in September 2009 be set
39 The husband became bankrupt in the course of the substantive proceedings
and his bankruptcy trustees were joined to the proceedings
on 22 August 2016,
but did not participate in the trial. Consequent upon the death of the husband
in 2018, the wife’s Amended
Initiating Application filed on 16
April 2014 was continued against the legal personal representative of the
husband under s 79A(1C)
of the Act.
40 As already noted, it has been necessary for a number of third parties who
interests may be affected by the relief sought by the
wife in the substantive
proceedings to be joined as parties to the proceedings (“the represented
third parties” or “the
appellants”).
41 By an Application in a Case filed on 8 July 2014 the appellants sought an
order that the wife’s Amended Initiating Application,
which sought that
the DODT purportedly made on 28 February 2002 be set aside and/or declared
a sham, be determined as a preliminary
42 On 29 July 2015 the appellants sought that the hearing listed to commence
on 29 July 2015 concern the determination of one issue
of fact, namely,
when and by whom the DODT dated 28 February 2002 was executed.
43 Consistent with the evidence of the husband, the wife advanced a case that
the DODT was not executed by the husband and was brought
into existence in 2006
44 The primary judge addressed the issue to be determined as a discrete
issue within the substantive s 79A proceedings in the 2018
reasons in the
following terms:
33. At this point, I am only required to determine, as a
matter of fact whether the DODT executed on the date that it bears. It is
finding about a factual issue from which consequential Orders may flow, but the
consequential steps, such as the setting aside
s79A(1)(a) and the wife’s
s79 application, are not a matters for me to consider at this time. Of course,
in terms of adducing
evidence, the seriousness and far-reaching implications of
the wife's applications under
of the Act affect the process by
which “reasonable satisfaction” will be reached about whether the
DODT was executed
on the date it bears. To that extent, the represented third
parties have participated fully in, and have largely driven, the finding
as a separate issue as a preliminary step.
34. I accepted that, within the context of the wife's potential application
under s79 of the Act, a finding that the DODT had been
executed on the date that
it bears would dispose of the wife’s application to have it set aside
and/or declared a sham; it
being common ground that the transactions
contemplated by the DODT have been effected.
35. The Court’s power to decide an issue in isolation from other issues
relevant to the Cause of Action finds expression in
rule 10.14(b)
Family Law Rules 2004
(Cth) (“FLR”) as “a hearing about
a fact”. The bases for so doing are that
deciding an
issue may dispose of all or part of the case (r10.13(a)), make a trial
unnecessary (r10.13(b)), and/or save substantial
costs (r10.13(d)). Perhaps
ironically, for a hearing that has proceeded for 87 days against an initial
estimate of 5 days, I remain
of the view that any final hearing will be
substantially shorter than it would have been if all issues were heard and
contemporaneously (r10.13(c)).
DECLARATORY RELIEF
36. The represented third parties have sought a declaration that the DODT was
executed on 28 February 2002. This application was
not made at the hearing or
orally, and in fact is inconsistent with submissions of Senior Counsel for the
represented third parties.
It appears for the first time as paragraph four of
their written closing submissions dated 30 August 2017. I will treat it as an
application noting that the wife had a right to respond (although did not
respond on this point).
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnote omitted)
45 As already noted, on 15 November 2019 the primary judge made the
following declaration and the following order respectively, that
are the subject
of these appeal proceedings:
2. I declare that the Deed of Declaration of Trust dated
28 February 2002 was not executed on the date that it bears.
4. I dismiss the application of the Represented Third Parties that I recuse
myself from these proceedings.
46 By Notice of Appeal filed on 13 December 2019 the appellants seek leave to
appeal from Order 2 and, if leave is granted, for that
order to be set
aside. The appellants contend that they appeal as of right from Order 4 and seek
that that order also be set aside.
Taken from the appellants’ Notice of
Appeal the relevant relief sought by the appellants in lieu of Order 4 is that
be made disqualifying the primary judge from further hearing the
proceedings.
47 The application for leave to appeal and the appeal is opposed by each of
the wife and the third respondent.
48 Each of those respondents contend that the appellants require leave to
appeal not only the declaration that was made but the order
refusing the recusal
application.
NATURE OF APPELLATE REVIEW
49 Before engaging with the challenges mounted on
appeal it is necessary that we make some observations about the protracted
of the proceedings before the primary judge.
50 We are of course mindful of our obligation, as an intermediate appellate
court undertaking an appeal by way of rehearing, to undertake
a real review of
the proceedings below. However, we consider that this obligation is tempered
where, as in this case, the proceedings
below were unduly protracted and appear
to involve extensive evidence going to some peripheral or irrelevant issues, or
excessively
protracted evidence.
51 Put simply, the discrete issue falling for determination by the
primary judge, dealt with as a preliminary issue, was the authenticity
the DODT. Even accepting that issue to be laden with factual disputes, and its
determination being driven by the need to carefully
assess the credibility and
evidence of a number of central witnesses, we cannot reconcile that it was
strictly necessary for this
case to occupy some 87 days (or part-days) of
hearing time spanning the period from the commencement of the hearing on 16 July
to the last written submission being filed more than three years later on
16 October 2017, even allowing for the interruption of
an appeal on an
interlocutory ruling concerning a disclosure issue. One consequence of the
expansive approach is that the transcript
of the proceedings thus far occupies
5,959 pages. The appeal book for this appeal occupies in excess of 7,300 pages.
52 Section 97(3) of the Act requires,
, that the court
endeavour to ensure that proceedings are not protracted. The
Family Law Rules
(Cth) impose specified responsibilities upon parties and lawyers (for
example r 1.08) directed to ensuring that cases are resolved
in a just and
timely manner at a cost to the parties and the court that is reasonable in the
circumstances of the case (r 1.04).
These requirements have not been met in this
case. Some obvious examples suffice to demonstrate this beyond the fact that the
occupied a total of 87 days spanning the time period referred
53 Because of his failing health, and the risk of the husband’s demise
before the substantive proceedings could be heard, the
cross-examination was not limited only to the issue of the authenticity of the
DODT but embraced also the issues
in the substantive proceedings. Even allowing
for that expansion, and acknowledging that by reason of his ill-health the
cross-examination was punctuated by adjournments,
cross-examination of the husband took place over no less than 23 days between 5
September 2014 and 27 August 2015. During that cross-examination a total of
no less than 262 exhibits were tendered into evidence.
54 Next, even though as the primary judge acknowledged the wife could
not provide any direct evidence concerning the authenticity
of the DODT(at [63]
of the 2018 reasons), the appellants’ cross-examination of the wife was
undertaken for a total period of
some 22 hours over 7 separate days in
February 2016 (at [58] of the 2018 reasons).
55 A final example, taken up with Queen’s Counsel for the wife in
the course of argument of the appeal, concerns an interlocutory
disclosure. In summary, the wife sought disclosure of documents in relation to
which Mr Jess Jnr claimed privilege, a claim
which was eventually
unsuccessful. We were informed from the bar table by reference to the relevant
documents that the dispute in
relation to this privilege claim occupied about 11
days of hearing time, albeit that Queen’s Counsel for the appellants
some issue with that total. In any event, it appears that the hearing time
consumed by this dispute was out of proportion to the
subject matter.
56 Whilst the appellants seek to emphasise our obligation to undertake a real
review of the proceedings below we record that we do
not intend to engage in any
repetition of what occurred in the proceedings below by way of undue indulgence
of peripheral issues
or engagement with excessive evidence.
57 The appellants contend that a significant delay attended the
primary judge delivering judgment with the consequence that it is
upon this Court to look with special care upon any finding of fact challenged on
appeal. The appellants point to the delay
between the hearing of evidence and
the delivery of the primary judge’
reasons. In reliance upon
Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd
[2006] FCA 392
(2004) 230 ALR 534
Expectation
Tattsbet Ltd v Morrow
[2015] FCAFC 62
(2015) 321 ALR
Wallis & Manning
[2017] FamCAFC 14
(2017) FLC 93-759
, the appellants submit
that the fact of long delay weakens the primary judge’s advantage in
having seen the oral and documentary
evidence unfold in a coherent manner. On
this basis the appellants contend that delay must be taken into account when
reviewing findings
made by the primary judge after a significant delay from
the time when the relevant evidence was given.
58 Whilst the primary judge made numerous and detailed references to the
trial transcript in the 2018 reasons we accept that in this
case it is necessary
to look with special care at the findings of fact challenged on appeal in the
circumstances of there being a
significant delay between the primary judge
receiving the evidence and delivering the 2018 reasons.
59 We accept that this means, in practical terms, that an appeal court must
ensure that the primary judge has provided a more comprehensive
explanation
than might otherwise be required. The Court in
Expectation
[71]–[72]) observed that, where there has been a significant delay:
(a) A more comprehensive statement of the relevant
evidence than would normally be required should be provided by the trial judge
in order to make manifest, to the parties and the public, that the delay has not
affected the decision; and
(b) It is incumbent upon a trial judge to inform the parties of the reasons why
the evidence of the particular witness has been rejected.
It is necessary for
the trial judge to say why he or she prefers the evidence of one witness over
the evidence of other witnesses.
60 Expectation
is also authority for the proposition that where a
trial judge demonstrates by the reasons for judgment that full consideration has
been given to all of the evidence, the parties and the public may be satisfied
that the delay has not affected the decision. More
specifically, if the reasons
demonstrate that the delay has not weakened the trial judge’s advantage,
confidence will be maintained
in the decision (
Expectation
[71]–[73]).
61 The 2018 reasons are extensive, running to 972 paragraphs and 298 pages,
including annexures. The index to the 2018 reasons reflects
that they deal with
numerous witnesses and brackets of evidence on multiple topics. The affidavit
evidence was extensive and the
exhibits tendered during the trial were numerous.
As already noted the appeal book comprises in excess of 7,300 pages.
62 Review of the 2018 reasons confirms that this fact-laden case required
numerous factual findings by the primary judge on disparate
issues, with
the fact finding exercise being driven in large part by the assessments made by
the primary judge of the demeanour and
credibility of some
25 witnesses who were called to give oral evidence. The primary judge
enjoyed the well-known advantages of a
trial judge including the advantage of
hearing and seeing the witnesses give evidence, and to consider and reflect upon
the evidence
as it unfolded in what turned out to be a lengthy trial.
Fox v Percy
(2003) 214 CLR 118
) the majority of the High Court expressed the advantage enjoyed
by a trial judge in these terms, accepting that the appellate court:
23. ...must, of necessity, observe the “natural
limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding
wholly or substantially on the record. These limitations include the
disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with
the trial judge in
respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the
“feeling” of a case which an
appellate court, reading the
transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not
typically get taken
to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial.
Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the
at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the
opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon
that evidence and
to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.

in a permanent position of disadvantage as against the trial judge, and, unless
it can be shown that he has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage,
the higher Court ought not to take the responsibility
of reversing conclusions
so arrived at, merely on the result of their own comparisons and criticisms of
the witnesses and of their
own view of the probabilities of the case. The course
of the trial and the whole substance of the judgment must be looked at, and
matter does not depend on the question whether a witness has been cross-examined
to credit or has been pronounced by the judge
in terms to be unworthy of it. If
his estimate of the man forms any substantial part of his reasons for his
judgment the trial judge's
conclusions of fact should, as I understand the
decisions, be let alone.
Devries v Australian National Railways Commission
(1993) 177 CLR
472, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed at 479:
More than once in recent years, this Court has pointed
out that a finding of fact by a trial judge, based on the credibility of a
witness, is not to be set aside because an appellate court thinks that the
probabilities of the case are against - even strongly
against – that
finding of fact. If the trial judge's finding depends to any substantial degree
on the credibility of the witness,
the finding must stand unless it can be shown
that the trial judge “has failed to use or has palpably misused his
or has acted on evidence which was “inconsistent with
facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence” or which was
“glaringly improbable”.

66 None of the foregoing is intended to support a conclusion to the effect
that the recognised advantages enjoyed by the primary judge
relieve this
Court of undertaking a “real review” of the evidence given at first
instance. In
[2019] HCA 28
(2019) 266 CLR 129
the High Court cited numerous
other authorities (including

when expressing this:
55. A court of appeal is bound to conduct a “real
review” of the evidence given at first instance and of the judge’s
reasons for judgment to determine whether the trial judge has erred in fact or
law. Appellate restraint with respect to interference
with a trial judge’s
findings unless they are “glaringly improbable” or “contrary
to compelling inferences”
is as to factual findings which are likely to
have been affected by impressions about the credibility and reliability of
formed by the trial judge as a result of seeing and hearing them give
their evidence. It includes findings of secondary facts which
are based on a
combination of these impressions and other inferences from primary facts.
Thereafter, “in general an appellate
court is in as good a position as the
trial judge to decide on the proper inference to be drawn from facts which are
undisputed or
which, having been disputed, are established by the findings of
the trial judge”...

Fox v Percy
Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ
28. Over more than a century, this Court, and courts
like it, have given instruction on how to resolve the dichotomy between the
appellate obligations and appellate restraint. From time to time, by
reference to considerations particular to each case, different
emphasis appears
in such reasons. However, the mere fact that a trial judge necessarily reached a
conclusion favouring the witnesses
of one party over those of another does not,
and cannot, prevent the performance by a court of appeal of the functions
it by statute. In particular cases incontrovertible facts or
uncontested testimony will demonstrate that the trial judge's conclusions
erroneous, even when they appear to be, or are stated to be, based on
credibility findings.
29. That this is so is demonstrated in several recent decisions of this Court.
In some, quite rare, cases, although the facts fall
short of being
“incontrovertible”, an appellate conclusion may be reached that the
decision at trial is “glaringly
improbable” or “contrary to
compelling inferences” in the case. In such circumstances, the appellate
court is not
relieved of its statutory functions by the fact that the trial
judge has, expressly or implicitly, reached a conclusion influenced
opinion concerning the credibility of witnesses. In such a case, making all due
allowances for the advantages available to
the trial judge, the appellate court
must “not shrink from giving effect to” its own conclusion. Finality
in litigation
is highly desirable. Litigation beyond a trial is costly and
usually upsetting. But in every appeal by way of rehearing, a judgment
appellate court is required both on the facts and the law. It is not forbidden
(nor in the face of the statutory requirement
could it be) by ritual incantation
finality in litigation
or reminders of the general advantages of the trial over
the appellate process.
(Footnotes omitted)
68 In this appeal the appellants bear the onus, in relation to seeking to
have this Court interfere with factual findings of the primary
demonstrating that the targeted finding is “glaringly improbable” or
“contrary to compelling inferences”
where any such finding can be
seen as likely to have been affected by impressions about the credibility and
reliability of witnesses.
The question of delay goes to the scrutiny to be
applied to the 2018 reasons in considering whether those reasons manifest that
has not affected the fact finding task or weakened the
primary judge’s advantage with respect to any challenged finding.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL IN RESPECT OF ORDER 2 OF THE ORDERS MADE ON
69 Whilst we propose to deal with each ground of
appeal discretely in topic form there is obviously significant overlap between
grounds and moreover the discussion of some grounds informs the discussion
of others. For example, some of the broad grounds to be
discussed are informed
by some of the narrower particular grounds. To avoid repetition we will
cross-reference where necessary. The grounds of appeal are set out as stated
in the Notice of Appeal filed on 13 December 2019, including
typographical
Ground 1: Wrong question determined
1. In circumstances where the primary judge
had earlier ruled that the question to be determined by the Court was when and
the Deed of Declaration of Trust dated 28 February 2002 (DODT) was
executed, the primary
judge erred in holding that she was
only required to determine as a matter of fact whether the DODT was executed on
the date that
it bears ([33]) and that it was not necessary for the wife to
prove the date on which the DODT was executed
70 Reference has earlier been made to the
primary judge’s articulation of the issues to be determined as a
preliminary issue.
71 At [49] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge set out the
wife’s case followed at [50] by the reference to the wife’s
of proof in the following terms:
49. The wife’s case is that the DODT was not
executed on the date that it bears. The wife contends that the DODT:-
a) is not a copy of a genuine document;
b) was not executed on 28 February 2002;
c) was created sometime during the post-separation period of the husband and
wife’s relationship and after the first meeting
between the husband and
divorce lawyers, P Lawyers, on 19 December 2006.
50. The burden of proof is governed by s 140 of the
Evidence Act 1985
(Cth) which provides that proof is on the balance of probabilities. By virtue of
the allegation of fraud and the gravity of matters
alleged, clear or cogent or
strict proof is necessary to satisfy the Court that the DODT was not executed on
the date that it bears,
namely 28 February 2002.
(As per the original)
72 Having set out the principles regarding the burden of proof by reference
to authority, the primary judge then referred to the wife’s
proof in these terms at [53] of the 2018 reasons:
53. As the wife argued that the DODT was a fraud, the
onus was on her to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the DODT was not
executed on 28 February 2002. The represented third parties submitted that as
the wife “abandoned every other basis on which
her claim was originally
brought...” the onus was on her to prove that the DODT was typed by
Mr Jess Jnr after he had shown
a hand written copy to Mr M. They
argue that the wife failed to discharge her burden of proving the DODT was not
executed in February
2002 but was, in fact, produced by Mr Jess Jnr
between 23 (or 29) January and 30 January 2007 and that she did not put
this allegation
to Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban or Ms C Jess in
cross-examination. I do not accept that it is necessary for the wife to prove
the date upon
which the DODT was executed. I regard it as sufficient if she
persuades me that it was not executed on 28 February 2002. As the thrust
wife’s case is that the original DODT and the copy DODT did not exist in
2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, if I am persuaded
that the wife is correct on that
count, then it follows that she has discharged the onus in relation to the DODT
not having been
executed on 28 February 2002. It is not necessary for me to be
satisfied that the DODT was not produced until in or after January
73 It is tolerably clear when the 2018 reasons are read as a whole that the
primary judge recorded findings that the DODT was fraudulent.
numerous references to it in those terms.
74 At [604] of the 2018 reasons under the heading “[w]as the DODT
created in 2006/2007?” the primary judge recorded this:
604. The wife will discharge her onus if she can
demonstrate that the DODT was not executed on the date it bears. It was common
that the wife does not need to establish the date on which the DODT was
executed. However, she infers that it was created in the
period from mid-2006,
when the relationship between husband and wife was coming to an end, and 30
January 2007 when a copy was produced
to Mr P. The represented third
parties attempted to establish that there was evidence of the DODT existing in
this period. They seek
to rely on Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban’s
evidence that the DODT was “raised and discussed” at a meeting with
on 19 December 2006 and at a meeting with Mr CC on 9 January
75 There follows a detailed and extensive discussion of evidence relating to
that topic. However, the point of emphasis for present
purposes is that at [808]
of the 2018 reasons the primary judge recorded a finding that
“Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were the drivers
of creating the
fraudulent DODT”. At [809] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge
records this:
809. ... The fact that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban
were so deeply involved in the early 2007 period in instructions to the divorce
and preparing the Form 13
goes to the point that the DODT was
fraudulently manufactured at some point significantly after 2002.
(Emphasis added)
76 Commencing at [965] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge set out a
summary of her essential conclusions in the case. These bear
quoting in full as
965. In considering this matter I have regard to the
very serious consequences which may flow from a finding that the DODT was not
created on the date which it bears. In due course those consequences may include
a loss of what was believed to be property interests
of Mr Jess Jnr,
the possibility that there will be a reduction in the assets owned or controlled
by Mr Jess Jnr as a result of the
wife’s potential s 79 claim (a
matter which is yet to be decided) and tax consequences of unspecified
proportions. There may
also be criminal consequences or civil penalties imposed
by reason of some of the main actors also being company office holders.
966. The matter is made more complex by the role of the husband. He
“changed sides” over the life of the various Court
proceedings both
in this Court and in the Supreme Court of Victoria. I have earlier found that
the husband had a tendency to allege
fraud when it suited him and he did not
want to comply with promises and agreements he made. Truthfulness was incidental
to the husband.
Little or no reliance can be placed upon what the husband says,
what he told the wife at various times or any other evidence of the
unless it is corroborated or unless independent plausible evidence standing
apart from the husband’s evidence establishes
to the requisite standard,
facts which support a finding.
967. Those representing the wife have recognised that their client bore a burden
to satisfy the Court of the fact alleged; that is
that the DODT was not created
on the date which it bears. They set about their task by constructing an
elaborate case based upon
an examination of many documents and pulling together
the strands of a complicated story. They discharged their duties skilfully
diligently.
968. It is even harder for the wife because she was not privy to the alleged
shenanigans. She was remote from the unscrupulous and
dishonest conduct which,
on balance, I am satisfied gave rise to the DODT. The burden lies with the wife
to prove, on a balance of
probabilities, that the DOD
executed on the date that it bears. She must satisfy the court, positively, of a
negative proposition. I find that she has
done so. In all of the evidence I have
read and heard and reviewed, there has been no evidence, which I accept, which
satisfies me
that the DODT was in existence as at 2002 - which is not to reverse
the onus but merely to state an obvious fact.
969. The husband’s credibility was demolished by the represented third
parties. However, the successful attack, with its emphasis
on his business
dealings, attack and avoid strategies, habitual allegations of fraud and
forgery, are entirely consistent with the
husband having done precisely what the
wife alleges. The probability of the DODT being in existence in 2002 was
undermined by there
being no credible evidence of the existence before 2006. The
manner in which the DODT was allegedly brought into existence is implausible.
When all of the elements, including the inability to produce an original
document, the inability to verify its creation, the imprecision
of its terms,
the actions of Mr Jess Jnr and the husband which were inconsistent
with its existence, that it was not implemented
in accordance with its terms (as
to a measurement against the Management accounts), it is an incredible scenario.
There was the damaging
contemporaneous evidence of the husband’s lawyers
(Mr P, Mr N
, Mr M, Ms Q and
Ms R) encapsulated by the comment of Mr M that “it doesn’t
pass the sniff test”. There was the
articulation, by
Mr Jess Jnr, that an alternative way of dealing with the ATO
difficulties would be to disavow the DODT and about
which I do not accept his
explanation.
970. A finding of fact is not a binary exercise. Satisfaction is reached by
looking at all of the evidence including
how it was adduced
and the way in which the evidence was given. The fact that the represented third
parties damaged the wife’s
case in many respects including with the
metadata evidence, the wife’s animosity to Mr Jess Jnr, the
death bed confession,
does not detract from the convincing aspects of her case.
That a convincing aspect of the wife’s case is the continual absence
credible evidence where, if the DODT existed in 2002, one would rationally
expect evidence is referrable to the wife seeking to
prove a negative
971. The wife was confronted by well-resourced and skilfully represented
opponents who prepared their case meticulously. It is the
skill and diligence of
those representing the represented third parties which eases the burden for the
Court in reaching a conclusion.
The Court can be certain that everything that
could have been done was done and the evidence as it stands is the best evidence
My findings on the evidence discussed above lead me to the conclude
comfortably and on the balance of probabilities, that the DODT
was not executed
on the date that it bears.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original)
77 It is tolerably clear that the issue for determination as a preliminary
issue was whether the DODT was a fraud having been created
some years after the
date it bears, or whether it was in fact executed on 28 February 2002. The wife
bore the onus of proving that
the DODT was a fraud on the basis that it was not
in fact executed on 28 February 2002 but was created on a date during or after
78 The primary judge expressed the findings to which we have referred
reflecting that the primary judge was satisfied that the wife
discharged her onus of proof.
79 We consider that the wife’s onus of proof could not feasibly have
extended to proving precisely when the DODT was created
and by whom. The wife
contended that she was a victim of fraud. She proved that by proving the DODT
was not entered into on the date
which it bears but was created years later. We
do not consider that the wife’s onus of proof extended to proving when and
whom precisely the fraudulent document was created, albeit that the
primary judge recorded the finding to which we have referred
“Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were the drivers of creating the
fraudulent DODT” (at [808] of the 2018 reasons).
80 We also do not consider that the exchanges in final submissions at trial
support any proposition to the effect that the appellants
were unaware of the
issue in relation to which the wife bore the onus of proof. The following
transpired in the course of exchanges
between the primary judge and
Queen’s Counsel for the appellants:
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS]: Yes. For
completeness, we understand my learned friend has closed his case and we said
that we would give consideration to whether we wanted to request
[Mr Jess Snr] again for further cross-examination. Your Honour,
not. So we regard [Mr Jess Snr’s] case as closed as well. So,
your Honour, to open the case on behalf of the Appellants,
your Honour,
issue for determination in this part of the proceeding is on what date was the
deed of declaration of trust bearing the date 28
February 2002 executed
That comes out of your Honour’s ruling.
HER HONOUR:
Isn’t it really whether it was executed on the date that it
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS]: I’m drawing that language from
the ruling your Honour made on 29 July 2015.
HER HONOUR:
I might not have said it very well. But I don’t — if
find that it was not — if it was executed years afterwards,
need to be satisfied as to what specific date years afterwards.
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS]:
Well, we say that the date
— well, our case, your Honour, is that, as your Honour knows, it was
– it was executed on the
date that it bears.
HER HONOUR: Right.
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS]: The case that we’ve had to
meet is that it was executed at a later time. We’ve
heard the evidence of
[Mr Jess Snr] which was that he first became aware of it on 27 March
That’s why your Honour may not be able to determine with
precision, if your Honour does not accept our case, what date the deed
declaration of trust was executed. But we say for our part it was executed on
the day that it bears and that has always been our
case, and it certainly was
not executed in 2006 or 2007.
Your Honour, we say that the declaration of
trust was a product of two necessities which arose in January and February of
(Transcript 2 December 2016, p.1017 line 20 to p.1018 line 3) (Emphasis
81 We find no substance in the complaint that the primary judge
determined the wrong question. It is clear that the primary judge
that the DODT was fraudulent and that was the ultimate question to be
determined.
Ground 2: Standard of proof not satisfied
2. Given that the allegations concerning the DODT
were matters of the utmost gravity, such that clear, cogent and strict proof was
necessary in accordance with
section 140
Evidence Act 1995
judge erred in finding that:
(a) the DODT was not executed on 28 February 2002 ([968]);
(b) “unscrupulous and dishonest conduct” gave rise to the
DODT ([968]);
(c) the Dear Dadda letter was a “document manufactured to be
evidence in a case” ([187]) and “a document constructed
authenticity to the DODT” ([188]);
(d) the 4 September 2006 documents:
(i) “were invented to facilitate a false trail of evidence to
corroborate the existence of the DODT prior to 19 December 2006”
(ii) “the 4 September documents were created to undermine the
wife’s case” ([570]);
(iii) “the only plausible explanation of the creation of the
documents is that the documents were created by someone who wished
to prove that
the DODT was executed on the date it bears” ([579]);
(iv) “even if the husband’s signatures were genuine, the 4
September documents could still have been created by or at
the direction of the
husband assisted by Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban and for the fraudulent
purposes.”[547]; and
(e) the documents annexed to the supplementary affidavit of Mr V were
not authentic ([277], [285] and [321]).
The primary judge ought to have found that Ms Jess’s case rose
no higher than inexact proofs, indefinite testimony and indirect
inferences such
that the Court could not be reasonably satisfied to the requisite standard that
the DODT was not executed on 28 February
primary judge was clearly cognisant of the “very serious
consequences” which may flow from a finding that the DODT
authentic, referring to such consequences at [965] of the 2018 reasons which we
have already quoted above.
83 The primary judge articulated the applicable standard of proof by
reference to authority in the following terms at [49]–[57]
of the 2018
49. The wife’s case is that the DODT was not
executed on the date that it bears. The wife contends that the DODT:-
a) is not a copy of a genuine document;
b) was not executed on 28 February 2002;
created sometime during the post-separation period of the husband and
wife’s relationship and after the first meeting between
the husband and
divorce lawyers, P Lawyers, on 19 December 2006.
50. The burden of proof is governed by s 140 of the
Evidence Act 1985
(Cth) which provides that proof is on the balance of
probabilities. By virtue of the allegation of fraud and the gravity of matters
alleged, clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary to satisfy the Court that
the DODT was not executed on the date that it bears,
namely 28 February
51. As Gordon J recently stated in
(citations omitted):
[15] “Where, as here, fraud is alleged, “reasonable
satisfaction” is not produced by inexact proofs, indefinite
testimony, or
indirect inferences. This does not mean that the standard of persuasion is any
higher than the balance of probabilities.
It does mean that the nature of the
issue necessarily affects the process by which the reasonable satisfaction is
[16] Why? There is a conventional perception that members of society do not
ordinarily engage in fraudulent conduct and a Court
should not lightly make a
finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has
been guilty of such conduct.
[17] The nature of the allegation requires, as a matter of common sense, the
careful weighing of testimony, the close examination
of facts proved as a basis
of inference and, on appeal, a comfortable satisfaction that the tribunal
reached both a correct and just
conclusion.
[18] The tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of the occurrence or existence
of a fact before it can be found. Where direct proof
is not available and
satisfaction of the civil standard depends on inference, “there must be
something more than mere conjecture,
guesswork or surmise”- there must be
more than “conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that
between them is [a] mere matter of conjecture”. An inference
will be no more than conjecture unless some fact is found which
suggests, or provides a reason in the circumstances particular to the case, that
a specific event happened or a specific
state of affairs existed. ”
is consistent with the earlier decision of
[2005] NSW CA 361
which summarises the position where fraud is to be
inferred from circumstantial evidence, as follows:-
The relevant principle in regard to civil cases was expressed by the High Court
in the case of
Bradshaw and McEwans Pty Ltd
(1951) 217 ALR 1
passage referred to as having been repeated many times. The passage is:-
“Of course as far as logical consistency goes many hypotheses may be put
which the evidence does not exclude positively. But
this is a civil and not a
criminal case. We are concerned with probabilities, not with possibilities. The
difference between the
criminal standard of proof in its application to
circumstantial evidence and this civil is that in the former the facts must be
as to exclude reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence, while the
latter you need only circumstances raising a more probable
inference in favour
of what is alleged. On questions of this sort, where direct proof is not
available, it is enough in the circumstances
appearing in the evidence give rise
to a reasonable indefinite inference: they must do more than give rise to
conflicting inferences
of equal degrees of probability so that the choice
between them is mere matter of conjecture: (see per Lord Robson, Richard Evans
& Co Ltd v Astley
[1911] UKLawRpAC 47
[1911] AC 674
, at 687). But if circumstances are proved in
which it is reasonable to find a balance of probabilities in favour of the
sought them, though the conclusion may fall short of certainty, it is
not to be regarded as mere conjecture or surmise - there must
be more than
“conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so the choice
between them is [a] mere matter of conjecture”.
An inference will be no
more than conjecture unless some fact is found which positively suggests, or
provides a reason in the circumstances
particular to the case, that a specific
event happened specific state of affairs existed.”
The civil standard proof is not a simple matter of belief and persuasion but of
“reasonable satisfaction” following a
real search for the truth and
evaluating the evidence adduced. The evaluative process has regard to the
matters mentioned in s140(2)
and other relevant variable factors, including
those referred to by Sir Owen Dickson in
Briginshaw v Briginshaw
the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description or the gravity
of the consequences flowing from a particular
finding and the parties’
respective power or capacity to produce or contradict the evidence. It takes
account of the instinctive
judicial feeling that even in civil proceedings a
Court should be surer before finding serious allegations proved than when
less serious or trivial matters. The law looks for probability not
certainty and envisages a degree of probability to the point that
satisfied that the alleged fact in issue is more likely than not.
Where, as here, proof of a fact in issue hinges on rational inferences based on
circumstantial, as distinct from, direct evidence,
the conclusion contended for
must be rational and reasonably open. There has to be something more than mere
conjecture or suspicion.
A proposition is proved on the balance of probabilities
in a circumstantial case when the combined weight or preponderance of the
totality of the available evidence favours it as the most likely explanation.
The more information consistent with one of a number
of competing hypotheses,
the more probable that explanation becomes.
53. As the wife argued that the DODT was a fraud, the onus was on her to prove,
on a balance of probabilities, that the DODT was
not executed on 28 February
2002. The represented third parties submitted that as the wife “abandoned
every other basis on
which her claim was originally brought...” the onus
was on her to prove that the DODT was typed by Mr Jess Jnr after he
shown a hand written copy to Mr M. They argue that the wife failed to
discharge her burden of proving the DODT was not executed in
February 2002 but
was, in fact, produced by Mr Jess Jnr between 23 (or 29) January and
30 January 2007 and that she did not put this
allegation to
Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban or Ms C Jess in cross-examination. I do
not accept that it is necessary for the wife to prove the
date upon which the
DODT was executed. I regard it as sufficient if she persuades me that it was not
executed on 28 February 2002.
As the thrust of the wife's case is that the
original DODT and the copy DODT did not exist in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, if I
persuaded that the wife is correct on that count, then it follows that she
has discharged the onus in relation to the DODT not having
been executed on 28
February 2002. It is not necessary for me to be satisfied that the DODT was not
produced until in or after January
54. The task at hand is to reach a conclusion on where the truth lies assisted
by, but not limited to, the civil standard of the
balance of probabilities. That
is, I do not need to stop short of considering what in truth occurred but I
must, at the very least,
be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that
something did or did not happen before I make a finding to that effect.

, Warnick J stated that a
judge need not specifically deal with every possibility raised in a case. His
Honour referred to the comments
by Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Gummow JJ in
Whisprun Pty Ltd (formerly Northwest Exports Pty Ltd v Dixon
[...] A judge's reasons are not required to mention every fact or argument
relied on by the losing party as relevant to an issue.
Judgments of trial judges
would soon become longer than they already are if a judges failure to mention
such facts and arguments
would be evidence that he or she had not properly
considered the losing party's case.
56. I would have liked these Reasons to be shorter but judicial fact finding is
of its nature methodical, uncreative, and particular.
This is a fact-heavy case
which spans 2002 to 2010 sometimes in minute detail and from a number of
perspectives. The practitioners
for the parties have trawled through an enormous
amount of evidence to extract every point they think could help them and/or
their opponent(s) to establish if the DODT was executed on the date it
bears. Not much remains obscure.
57. I have reflected on the evidence relevant to the date on which the DODT was
executed and I have tried to deal with most of the
submissions. Just because I
have not mentioned a fact or an argument does not mean that it is a matter to
which I have not had regard.

for the appellants confirmed on
the hearing of the appeal that there was no submission to the effect that

, the authority to which the primary judge
referred, Carmody J expressed the standard of proof applicable in the
following terms:
145. Lord Nicholls discussed the relevant standard of
proof to be applied in non-criminal proceedings in his judgment in
Ors (Minors (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)
in the context of a wardship
application. His Lordship relevantly stated:
“Despite their special features, family proceedings remain essentially a
form of civil proceedings. Family proceedings often
raise various serious
issues, but so do other forms of civil proceedings.
The balance of probability standard means that a court is satisfied an event
occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence,
the occurrence of the
event is more likely than not. When assessing the probabilities the court will
have in mind as a factor, to
whatever extent is appropriate in the particular
case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event
occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court
concludes that the allegation is established on the balance
of probability.
Fraud is usually less likely than negligence. Deliberate physical injury is
usually less likely than accidental physical
injury ... Built into the
preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in
respect of the seriousness
of the allegation.
Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious
allegation is in issue the standard of proof required
is higher. It means only
that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to
be taken into account when
weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on
balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must
the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its
occurrence will be established”.
146. What this means in a practical sense is the more serious the allegation,
the more cogent the evidence required to overcome the
unlikelihood of what is
alleged and thus to prove it.
147. Thus, civil proof is not a simple matter of belief and persuasion but of
“reasonable satisfaction” following a real
evaluating the evidence adduced with regard to the matters mentioned in s 140(2)
and other relevant variable
factors, including those referred to by Dixon J in
and in the light of the parties’ respective power or
capacity to produce or contradict it.
148. The balance of probability standard takes account of the instinctive
judicial feeling that even in civil proceedings a court
should be surer before
finding serious allegations proved than when deciding less serious or trivial
matters. However, the law looks
for probability not certainty. There are degrees
of probability but, when the law talks about “the balance of
probabilities”,
it envisages a degree of probability to the point that a
court can be satisfied that the alleged fact in issue is more likely than
149. Where, as here, proof of a fact in issue hinges on rational inferences
based on circumstantial, as distinct from, direct evidence,
the conclusion
contended for must be rational and reasonably open. There has to be something
more than mere conjecture or suspicion.
A proposition is proved on the balance
of probabilities in a circumstantial case when the combined weight or
preponderance of the
totality of the available evidence favours it as the most
likely explanation. The more information consistent with one of a number
competing hypotheses, the more probable that explanation becomes.

”) confirms that the standard of proof in this
case is the balance of probabilities. There is not some different or further
standard of proof because the primary judge was required to determine
allegations of fraud. In
Rejfek v McElroy
[1965] HCA 46
(1965) 112 CLR 517
the High Court, when discussing the application of
allegations of fraud, observed at 521:
...proof of fraud should be clear and cogent such as to
induce, on a balance of probabilities, and actual persuasion of the mind as
the existence of the fraud ... The “clarity” of the proof required,
where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found,
is an acknowledgment that the
degree of satisfaction for which the civil standard of proof calls may vary
according to the gravity
of the fact to be proved.

the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane & Gaudron JJ) observed
at 449–450:
The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who
bears the onus in civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance
probabilities. That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves
criminal conduct or fraud. On the other hand, the strength
of the evidence
necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary
according to the nature of what it
is sought to prove. Thus, authoritative
statements have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict
proof is necessary
“where so serious a matter as fraud is to be
found”. Statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as
directed to the standard of proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely
reflecting a conventional perception that members
of our society do not
ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that
a court should not lightly
make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities,
a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct.

evidence. In

Chamberlain v The Queen (No. 2)
[1984] HCA 7
(1984) 153 CLR 521
Gibbs CJ and
Mason J held at 536:
When the evidence is circumstantial the jury, whether in
a civil or in a criminal case, are required to draw an inference from the
circumstances of the case; in a civil case the circumstances must raise a more
probable inference in favour of what is alleged...
90 The primary judge makes extensive reference to
Palmer v Dolman
at [52] of the 2018 reasons quoted above. In
Palmer v Dolman
the New South Wales Court of Appeal expressed the following principles
governing, in a civil case, whether circumstantial
evidence leads to an
inference of fraud:
(a) The jury must consider “the weight which is to
be given to the united force of all of the circumstances put
(b) The onus of proof is only to be applied at the final stage of the reasoning
(c) The inference drawn from the proved facts must be weighed against realistic
possibilities as distinct from possibilities that
might be regarded as fanciful;
(d) Where the competing possibilities are of equal likelihood, or the choice
between them can only be resolved by conjecture, the
allegation is not

(1866) 176 ER 850
the Court stated at 853:
It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be
considered as a chain, and each piece of evidence as a link in the chain, but
that is not so, for then, if any one link broke, the chain would fall. It is
more like the case of a rope comprised of several cords.
One strand of the cord
might be insufficient to sustain the weight, but three stranded together may be
quite of sufficient strength.
Chamberlain v R
[1983] FCA 78
(1983) 46 ALR 493
the Full Court of the Federal
Court emphasised the dangers of considering particular issues in isolation,
highlighting that it was
the effect of the case as a whole that must be
considered.
93 In this case the primary judge was required to assess a great deal of
evidence placed before her and a number of “strands”
supporting the
conclusion that the DODT was not executed on the date that it bears. None of the
primary judge’s factual findings
stood in isolation in persuading her
Honour that the DODT had not been executed on the date that it bears.
94 The 2018 reasons reflect that this was a fact-laden case and the
primary judge was called upon to consider and assess a plethora
of evidence
on multiple topics. That consideration and ultimate assessment was significantly
driven by the impressions formed by
the demeanour and credibility of multiple
witnesses relating to many topics, not simply those several topics identified by
the appellants
in this ground.
95 In our judgment the 2018 reasons reflect a meticulous analysis of the
whole of the evidence and a detailed examination of, and
reasoning to, the
conclusion the primary judge reached, on the balance of probabilities, that
the DODT was not executed on the date
96 The appellants contend, in support of this ground, that each of the
specific findings identified in this ground were based only
upon inferences
amounting to no more than conjecture in circumstances where the husband’s
credibility had been demolished and
the direct evidence provided by each of
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban had withstood cross-examination.
97 We do not accept the premise that the inferences the primary judge
drew were no more than conjecture, nor do we accept the premise
primary judge found the direct evidence of Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban
to be credible. In our judgment on any fair reading of
the conclusions reached
by the primary judge as expressed in the 2018 reasons neither of these
contentions is supported.
is authority for the proposition that an inference will be
more than conjecture if some fact is found which positively suggests,
provides a reason in the circumstances particular to the case, that a specific
event happened or a specific state of affairs existed
Jones v Dunkel
[1959] HCA 8
(1959) 101 CLR 298
at 305). The
primary judge’s conclusion that the DODT was not executed on the date
that it bears was substantiated by numerous
findings detailed in the 2018
reasons. As but one example, the primary judge recorded a finding that the
case for the appellants
was “meticulously prepared” but was
“implausible” (at [22] of the 2018 reasons). That overall
was informed by findings including, by way of example, the following
finding expressed at [19] of the 2018 reasons;
19. Communications about the DODT had been sparse. On
the represented third parties
case, Mr Ban drafted the DODT in
2002 but did not discuss it with Mr Jess Jnr until 2006. Nor did Mr
Ban tell Mr Jess Jnr that he
was responsible for drafting it until
2007, notwithstanding that they worked alongside one another at XC for all of
that time. Mr
Jess Jnr’s wife, Ms C Jess, said that
she had seen a photocopy of the DODT in 2003 and discussed it with
Mr Jess Jnr at that
time but not again until 2006. In the intervening
four years, the husband, Mr Jess Jnr or Mr Ban had not mentioned the
DODT or the
underlying concept of it to the numerous lawyers and professionals
who variously acted for BCJ, the husband and Mr Jess Jnr in commercial
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnote
99 The primary judge’s finding at [19] of the 2018 reasons
reflects that notwithstanding that the appellants produced a large
documents these did not include any real documentary evidence that the DODT
existed prior to about 2006. No original of
the DODT was ever produced. Not a
single contemporaneous email making reference to it was produced.
100 The lack of contemporaneous documents to establish the existence of the
DODT, including an original version of the DODT itself,
went beyond the matters
referred to. For example, under the terms of the DODT the triggering event for
the husband’s units
to vest to Mr Jess Jnr was a profit level as
recorded in “Management accounts”. As the 2018 reasons reflect no
such Management
accounts were produced by the appellants. Clearly the
primary judge was rightly concerned about that topic with the
primary judge
finding that there was a belated attempt to produce documents
meeting that description well after the event (at [260]–[321]
2018 reasons).
101 The primary judge recorded a finding that
“Mr Jess Jnr was evasive in relation to the question of the
Management accounts”
(at [283] of the 2018 reasons). The
primary judge found that “[t]he existence or non-existence of
something resembling a Management
account was muddled and confusing. I find that
Mr Jess Jnr was deliberating obfuscating [sic]. I am in doubt as to
whether Management
accounts did in fact exist” (at [285] of the 2018
reasons). The primary judge recorded a finding that
Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence
considerably and expressed no confidence in the reliability of his evidence (at
[291] of the
2018 reasons). It was in this context that the
primary judge considered the belated delivery of an affidavit from
Mr V, an audit
partner with U Consultants, attaching “something
resembling Management accounts” (at [292] of the 2018 reasons). From
to [313] of the 2018 reasons, the primary judge undertakes a detailed
discussion of Mr V and his evidence. The primary judge
concluded that
Mr V’s evidence should be accorded little weight (at [313] of the
2018 reasons). Nothing to which we are directed
on appeal demonstrates any error
on the part of the primary judge in this respect.
102 Review of the 2018 reasons reflects that the primary judge undertook
a detailed consideration of her impressions of the credit
of the central
witnesses in the case. These assessments underpin the primary judge’s
conclusions about the DODT and the primary
judge carefully explained why
the evidence of a particular witness was rejected or why she preferred the
evidence of one witness
over others.
103 It bears emphasis that review of the 2018 reasons confirms that it was
not simply the lack of credibility of the central witnesses
appellants’ case upon which the primary judge relied. There was
sufficient factual evidence to persuade the primary
judge that the DODT was
not executed on the date it bears.
104 Moreover, the 2018 reasons reflect that the primary judge carefully
considered the evidence relied upon by the appellants for
the essential
contention that the DODT was authentic.
105 In relation to what is referred to as the “4 September 2006
documents” the primary judge set out the description of
documents at [526] of the 2018 reasons in the following terms:
526. There were three copy documents produced which on
their face record a meeting of X Pty Ltd on 4 September 2006 that deals with
DODT (“the 4 September documents”). The documents were:-
a letter from
the husband in his capacity as Director of X Pty Ltd, requesting a transfer of
ordinary units and class D units from
the husband to Mr Jess Jnr
(“letter from the husband”),
meeting by Directors held at the Suburb VV office (“minutes of 2006
Directors meeting”), and
a letter from
the husband as VVV Pty Ltd to the Directors of X Pty Ltd requesting transfer of
the units that were regained after the
Mr QQ settlement (“VVV
(As per the original) (Footnote omitted)
106 The 4 September 2006 documents were the only documents that made mention
of the DODT prior to 18 December 2006, being the date
upon which the wife
commenced property settlement proceedings following separation. Plainly, if the
4 September 2006 documents were
authentic, they tended to support the
appellants’ case that the DODT was executed on 28 February 2002.
107 However, the 4 September 2006 documents were not relied upon by the
appellants, as is referred to by the primary judge at [532]
of the 2018
reasons. The primary judge there recorded:
532. Taking the 4 September documents at face value,
they tend to support the represented third parties
case that the
DODT was executed on 28 February 2002. They undermine the wife’s assertion
that the DODT was created in 2007
and the husband’s assertion that he
first became aware of the DODT when it was produced to him on 27 March 2007. The
4 September
documents pre-date the institution of the Franchise proceedings
which were issued by XC against the wife, her sister and brother
in law on 1
November 2006 and also the separation of the husband and the wife on 2 November
2006. It remains, however, that the represented
third parties did not rely on
the documents in this proceeding and reiterated that Mr Jess Jnr had
‘distanced’ himself
from the documents as soon as they were brought
to his attention in the Trust Proceedings.
(Tracked changes in original)
108 Notably, even if the 4 September 2006 documents could have been proved to
have been created in September 2006, even if what they
contained was false, they
were still capable of undermining the wife’s case. That feature was
acknowledged by the primary judge
at [548] of the 2018 reasons as
548. Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban denied having been
involved in the manufacture of the 4 September
It was the represented third
submission that they are unaware of who created 4
September 2006 documents or the date on which they were created. Whilst having
established that the husband had the opportunity to execute the 4 September
documents on that day in 2006, the represented third
parties stopped short of
contending that he did so. That is notable because, even if the content of the 4
September 2006 documents
is conceded by everyone to be false, if it could be
proved that they were created in September 2006 that would tend to undermine
wife’s case that the DODT was not contemplated until later in 2006 and not
created until 2007. The position adopted by
the represented third parties tends
on a balance of probabilities to support an element of
case that false documents were brought into existence.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnote
109 The 2018 reasons contain a very extensive and detailed discussion of the
4 September 2006 documents comprising paragraphs [526]–[579]
and occupying
15 pages with 97 footnotes. Viewed against the detail provided by the
primary judge in that discussion, the complaint
in this ground of failure
by the primary judge to provide any or any sufficient reasons is
110 It is unnecessary to set out the primary judge’s discussion in full
or attempt to summarise it. It needs to be read in full.
However, the following
facts and findings extracted from that discussion, operate to support the
primary judge’s overall conclusions
on this topic:
(a) No originals of the 4 September 2006 documents were
ever produced before the primary judge, nor were these produced in the
proceedings. Despite an order for its production in the
trust proceedings, the computer on which the documents could have been
was not made available for inspection (at [527] of the 2018 reasons).
Obviously this forestalled any investigations that might have
been undertaken to
establish the provenance of these documents;
(b) The significance of the 4 September 2006 documents is their pre-December
2006 reference to the DODT. Despite this significance,
the documents were
“conspicuously”
relied upon by the appellants in the
trust proceedings (at [528] of the 2018 reasons);
(c) The Directors’ meeting minutes in the 4 September 2006 documents never
in fact occurred; and neither of the letters were
ever sent or received (at
[531] of the 2018 reasons);
(d) The 4 September 2006 documents correctly identified the trustee of the YUT,
notwithstanding that it was not until March 2008
that the correct identity of
the trustee (and the error in the Writ in the trust proceedings) was discovered
(at [569] of the 2018
(e) The appellants did not dispute the submission by the wife that the DODT was
not discussed between Mr Ban and Mr Jess Jnr or between
Mr Jess Jnr and the husband until 19 December 2006. They did not
take issue with the contention that there was no discussion about
the DODT until
January 2007. It was Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence that he was not
aware that Mr Ban had prepared the DODT until 2007
(at [531] of the 2018
(f) The appellants did not rely on the 4 September 2006 documents in the
proceedings before the primary judge and reiterated that
Mr Jess Jnr had “distanced” himself from the documents as
soon as they were brought to his attention in the trust proceedings
(at [532] of the 2018 reasons);
(g) The primary judge found Mr CC to be an unreliable witness. He was
the person who unearthed the set of false documents dated 4
September 2006 which
referred to the DODT as being in existence at that time (at [537] of the 2018
(h) It was not in dispute in the proceedings that the 4 September 2006 documents
are false documents. Their existence and location
in the offices of XC called
for an explanation (at [541] of the 2018 reasons);
(i) It was common ground that at the time of the trust proceedings during which
the 4 September 2006 documents came to light the
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were acting in support of one another with the
same motivation to support that the DODT was executed
on the date it bears. The
evidence of Ms R, a solicitor from P Lawyers, the husband’s
solicitors in the first family law proceedings,
includes her note of the husband
having said to her, on 22 April 2007, that he had directed that the
4 September 2006 documents be
created (at [547] of the 2018 reasons);
(j) Each of the affidavits of Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban and Mr CC were
elusive about how the 4 September 2006 documents came to their attention
(at [549] of the 2018 reasons);
(k) Mr EE gave evidence that at a time when he was acting for
Mr Jess Jnr he was unaware of the 4 September 2006 documents until
they were passed to him by Mr CC in the course of the trust proceedings
hearing (at [553] of the 2018 reasons); and
(l) Mr CC wrote an email to Mr EE on 29 May 2009 containing the
assertion that Mr Jess Jnr directed him into the room at XC in which
he found the 4 September 2006 documents. Despite that email Mr CC denied
having been directed by Mr Jess Jnr to the location of the
(at [556] and [557] of the 2018 reasons).
111 It bears emphasis that each of Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban gave
evidence that the existence of the DODT was not discussed between them
husband prior to 19 December 2006. Accepting that to be so, there could have
been no reason to create the 4 September 2006
documents prior to that time. As
the primary judge noted at [570] of the 2018 reasons, the appellants
offered no plausible alternative
explanation as to when or by whom the 4
September 2006 documents were created. At [570] of the 2018 reasons the
primary judge recorded:
570. It was Mr CC’s evidence no one knew the
provenance of the 4 September 2006 documents, however that there as a theory
the documents had possibly be drafted by
the former Chief Financial Officer of XC.
Mr CC stated that they had made inquiries but Mr KK refused to
Mr KK was not called as a witness. The
represented third parties rely on the wife’s evidence, given in February
the wife met with Mr KK in 2010 and perhaps in
The represented third parties submitted that I
should infer that the evidence of Mr KK (and some other people) would not
have assisted
the wife’s case and that I should regard any evidence of
Mr KK as benign notwithstanding that they did not put to the wife
Mr KK could have created the 4 September documents. In the circumstances, I
would be more inclined to draw the opposite inference
if I was minded to draw a
Jones v Dunkel
inference at all. It was open to the wife to call
Mr KK, but there was little utility in her doing so, as her case had closed
the time Mr CC gave evidence. Mr Jess Jnr (and his lawyers)
who called Mr
CC, had access to him for the purpose of
obtaining a proof of his evidence and drawing affidavit material. Had Mr CC
advanced the
theory that Mr KK drafted the 4 September documents, the
represented third parties could have called Mr KK under the compulsion of
subpoena. Their failure to issue a subpoena to Mr KK or give an explanation
for why this was not done could justify the drawing
of an inference that having
Mr KK’s evidence would not have assisted their case. As it is, I am
satisfied that the 4 September
documents were created to undermine the
wife’s case, and the represented third parties and their witnesses offer
no plausible
explanation as to when or by whom the 4 September documents were
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnotes
112 On the chain of reasoning discussed by the primary judge it was open
to her Honour to find that the only plausible explanation
for the creation of
the 4 September 2006 documents was their creation by someone who wished to prove
that the DODT was executed on
the date that it bears. In context, it mattered
not whether this was the husband acting alone, or the husband acting in concert
Mr Jess Jnr and/or Mr Ban.
113 It bears emphasis that the appellants did not adduce any evidence of the
original DODT. Nor was there adduced into evidence, despite
documents, any contemporaneous emails referring to the existence of the DODT and
no other documents referring to it prior
to the 4 September 2006 documents
referred to.
114 Moreover, whilst we deal further with the issue of Management accounts
when dealing with Ground 20, it is significant that the
documentation consistent with the existence of the DODT included the absence of
Management accounts. That is, the appellants,
as will be further discussed,
could produce no real Management accounts within the meaning of the relevant
clause of the DODT.
115 Aside from the absence of contemporaneous documentary evidence, there was
other evidence in the case which the primary judge considered
inconsistent with the existence of the DODT at any time prior to the husband and
the wife’s separation in 2006. Much of
this evidence will be referred to
when addressing other grounds but, in summary, that evidence included the
husband, Mr Jess Jnr
or Mr Ban not acting consistently with the
existence of the DODT. For example, the meeting on 19 December 2006 with the
solicitors in the first family law proceedings, which is
discussed in further detail in addressing Ground 11.
116 Likewise, there were meetings with Mr T of S Lawyers who acted
on the husband’s behalf between 2002 and 2004 for the purpose
preparation and there was no mention of the DODT (at [252]–[259] of the
2018 reasons).
117 Further, the settlement with a former unit holder in the YUT, Mr QQ,
in November 2002 saw the husband dealing with his units in
the YUT in a
manner apparently inconsistent with the terms of the DODT (at [322]–[328]
of the 2018 reasons).
118 In this context we refer to the discussion addressing other grounds as
highlighting evidence which the primary judge considered
to be inconsistent
with the existence of the DODT. These include the meeting on 19 December 2006,
which is the subject of Ground
11; the evidence of Mr M QC, the
subject of Ground 13 and Ground 14; drawings by the husband from his loan
account, the subject of
Ground 16 and indeed most of the other grounds now to be
119 We are satisfied that the primary judge carefully weighed all of the
evidence, including evidence tending to show the validity
of the DODT, before
concluding on the balance of probabilities that the DODT was not created on the
date that it bears. We are satisfied
that her Honour reached that
conclusion by applying the appropriate standard of proof having regard to the
whole of the evidence.
We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 3: Erroneous finding concerning the husband and
wife’s agreement reached in 2010
3. Given that the
judge found that
Ms Jess and Mr Jess
Snr were working together and had a common interest ([905] and [933]), the
primary judge erred in not finding
that the husband and wife had reached an
agreement that Mr Jess Snr would falsely claim that the DODT was a
120 Taken from the appellants’ Outline of
Submissions filed on 24 August 2020 in support of this ground, there are six
or matters identified which the appellants contend support this
121 The complaint in this ground appears to repeat the complaint made to the
primary judge and which was dealt with by the primary
[905]–[933] of the 2018 reasons. It can be seen from those paragraphs of
the 2018 reasons that each of the matters
particularised in the
appellants’ Outline of Submissions in support of this ground were
considered and addressed by the primary
judge in some detail. The specific
complaint now is that the primary judge failed to have regard to the
“cumulative effect”
of these matters.
122 Whilst somewhat lengthy, it is necessary to extract the
primary judge’s discussion relevant to this ground to demonstrate
that the primary judge gave appropriate consideration to each of the
matters raised. Paragraphs [905]–[933] of the 2018 reasons
THE HUSBAND AND WIFE’S
‘AGREEMENT’
905. I have accepted that in these proceedings the husband and wife can be
treated as one team or camp, advancing the same arguments
with a common purpose
of proving that the DODT was a fraud. The represented third parties submitted
that the husband and wife came
together to argue this and their behaviour in the
course of doing so indicates the whole allegation of fraud was concocted by them
and, inferentially, that the DODT was in fact executed on the date it bears.
Letter to wife before dinner meeting, 20 December 2010
906. On 20 December 2010, the wife and husband had dinner. Prior to the dinner
the husband wrote a letter to the wife with an agenda
of sorts of proposed
topics for the discussion at dinner
The represented
third parties submitted that the letter was significant for three reasons.
907. Firstly, it did not mention the alleged confession to the wife on 31 May
908. Secondly, it proposed a joint “attack” because “this is
the very thing that they fear occurring”. The
represented third parties
submitted that had the death-bed confession occurred, there would be no need for
an agreement and especially
not seven months after the confession. I do not
place any weight on the fact that the confession was not mentioned. The letter
to be an agenda it does not detail a chronology of events. It appears
mostly forward looking. Furthermore, the letter indicates that
the wife and
husband had discussed the matter before this date. It was never the wife’s
argument that on 31 May 2010 the husband
and wife set forth a plan on how to
prove the fraud against her. The represented third parties
submission on this point is weak.
909. Thirdly, the letter discusses the DODT in the terms that “we both
believe to be a fraud on the trust matter”. The
represented third parties
submitted that had the husband always known the DODT was a fraud he would not
have said he believed it
to be a fraud.
910. The represented third parties stated that, at first, the husband did not
question the validity of the letter, stating he had
seen and read the letter
before but could not explain the reason for writing it. The represented third
parties then submitted that
a few days later, in the witness box, the husband
“seized on the slightest opportunity to fundamentally change his
and alleged the letter was a fraud. The following exchange
?---Do – do you mind if I – before I answer that question, Mr
Waller, this letter is unsigned.
[Mr Jess Snr], I took you to this letter last Thursday?---I know you
The judge asked you whether you had had time to read it. You said you had?---I
– I – I believe I had – I think
– you read the
transcript, Mr Waller. I – I assumed the letter – written on my
letterhead with my name beside it

from me but when I look at this again today, as I speak, I’ve learnt the
anything you put in front of me from – from your people – I
– I don't – this – I don’t –
I will say to you,
now I’ve got this letter in my hand, I don’t believe that it’s
a true letter from me.
Why didn’t you say that when I showed it - - -?---Because I didn't - -
- - - to you on Thursday?---Well, because I’m not the – not the
sharpest tack in the box, Mr Waller.
Have you spoken to other people - - -?---No. I haven’t spoken - - -
- - - about this letter over the weekend?--- - - - to anyone about it at
Right. It refers to the expression, “Pandora’s Box”, doesn't
it?---It refers to a lot of things, but it’s
not signed.
Yes. And that expression, “Pandora’s Box”, appears in the file
note that [Mr P] made two days later?---It may do.
In the dictionary also,
Yes?---It’s a common word.
You're keen, now, to distance yourself from this letter, aren’t you?---No.
I’m not – I’m not distancing myself
from the letter. I wonder
where you got it from, Mr Waller.
Well - - -?---It’s not in my file.
- - - who asked you - who raised that question with you?---Nobody, Mr Waller. My
So you’ve been thinking about this letter over the weekend?---No. No,
I’ve been thinking about what you hand to me regularly
as being a genuine
letter from me, unsigned by me. I would like to look at the date, who it’s
addressed to, who received it.
I have no – there’s no receipt on
this letter. There’s nothing.
911. The represented third parties suggested that either someone pointed out
the significance of the letter to the husband or he
worked it out for himself.
They submit, and I agree that, this is another example of the husband alleging
fraud when a document does
not suit his position. I also accept that the letter
was in fact written by the husband.
Meeting with Mr P, 22 December 2010
912. On 22 December 2010, the husband met with Mr P. Mr P was
cross-examined about the following parts of his notes from the
Agreement between [Mr Jess Snr] and [Mr Jess Snr] not
– between [Mr Jess Snr] and [Ms Jess] not to claim.
Tax: I owe $50 million.
I want her to sign a document, no claim on me or the estate.
If I raise the declaration of trust as fraud, she has grounds to open the
declaration of trust
She says declaration of trust a sham - I’m a bit vague about it.
Kids are what [Mr Jess Jnr] has done – don’t control co +
they are aware of predicament
913. However, I note that Mr P was not cross-examined about other parts of
his notes including:
“Declaration of Trust” issue – could be Pandora’s Box
– want to her to sign a document to claim on
me or the estate
“Declaration of Trust” [the wife], she talked of settlement, kids +
self, declaration was a fraud, had a signature.
If I was to declare – perjury issues – prepared to cop it.
She says dec of trust a sham – [I’m] a bit vague about it –

[...] stroke in 2006 – things started to happen/[Mr Jess Jnr] on
mission to...my assets...malice.
914. The represented third parties submitted that the husband did not tell
Mr P the DODT was a fraud and pointed to the fact that
the husband was said
to have told Mr P that it was the wife who said the DODT was a sham and the
husband was “a bit vague about
The essence
third parties
argument is that the
husband was posing the possibility of a fraud rather than explaining that the
fraud had indeed occurred.
915. The represented third parties seek to rely on the following exchange to
establish that the husband did not tell Mr P it was
MR STRUM: And, in fact, [Mr P], the fact is, he didn’t tell you
during that meeting that the deed of declaration was a fraud,
did he?---My
recollection is that he did, and he was hinting around it to begin with. And - -
Well?--- - - - he told me that.
Well, [Mr P], I put to you that nowhere in your note does it state or does
it record that he asserted to you – that he told
you that the deed of
declaration was - - -?---Correct. That’s correct.
- - - a fraud?---It doesn’t say that.
And, in fact, if he had done that you would have noted it, wouldn’t
you?---I would have.
916. The represented third parties also highlight that the husband discussed
that the ATO were pursuing him for $50 million and
that it was troubling
They also pointed out that the husband told
Mr P that he had come to an agreement with the wife so she would not claim
against him
917. Largely the chain of events told by the husband to Mr P seems largely
consistent with what has been argued. However, the represented
third parties
highlighted that the husband did not tell Mr P he had confessed to the
fraud to the wife on 31 May 2010
nor that the DODT was
first presented to him on 27 March 2007 by Mr Ban already
918. I am satisfied that it is clear from Mr P’s note that the fraud
and the DODT were discussed by the husband at the meeting
with Mr P. There
is little mileage to be made by the represented third parties in the
husband’s evidence. He was a highly flawed
6-8 January 2011
919. On 6 January 2011, the husband met with the wife
On 8 January 2011, the husband noted in his diary “Challenge Dec of
When asked why he made this
notion, the husband responded
I don’t know. That's about – what, four years ago. I –
remember, I’m not the sharpest tack in the box, Mr
920. The represented third parties submitted that given the time of year and
the husband’s meeting with the wife two days
before, the only plausible
explanation for the note is that the husband was discussing with the wife the
best way to take steps to
set aside the DODT. When this was put to him the
husband denied this
I don’t regard this event as
probative of the issue of the date on which the DODT was
Emails to Franchisee’s, 14 and 17 January
921. On 14 January 2011, the husband sent an email to every Y Business
Franchisee stating that there had been “a major fraud
perpetrated
on” the husband “by [Mr Jess Jnr] and
[Ms D Jess], [Mr Ban], [Mr HH], [Mr JJ] and
The email stated that he was resigning
as Chairman of XC and taking legal action against Mr Jess Jnr and
“all concerned”.
922. On 17 January 2011, the husband sent a follow up email to the franchisees
providing more information about what he called the
“alleged criminal
fraud” perpetrated against him. He wrote
I would like for you to appreciate that I have said nothing for more than one
year but have elected to gather evidence of what I
now allege is a fraud
perpetrated on me and my family ...and to a huge and undeserved extent on my
former wife [Ms Jess] and this
is not acceptable to me. Therefore I hope
you can understand the motivation behind my legal actions and their implications
what I must now do to recover my assets for myself and my family.
923. I do not regard these events as probative of the issue at hand.
Meeting with Mr P and Mr N, 19 January 2011
924. The husband drafted an agenda for his meeting with Mr P on 19 January
2011. The agenda records
1. Agreement between [Mr Jess Snr] and [Ms Jess] in respect to
no further action on her part, which she has agreed to in principal.
8. The declaration of trust and what action should be taken.
925. Mr P’s notes record the husband saying at this meeting
“[Mr FF] wrote and made arrangement and ATO said get
The represented third parties use this
note to submit that there were no instructions recorded that the husband said
the DODT was
a fraud. The represented third parties submitted that Mr N did
not recall the husband mentioning the deathbed confession at this
note that Mr N stated that his primary recollection was as
As I’ve indicated, my recollection is [Mr Jess Snr] was
primarily concerned about [Mr Jess Jnr] not doing things that
Snr] felt he should. One of those things was dealing with the
ATO to – whether that was because [Mr Jess Snr] felt concerned
number of things that were supposed to be dealt
with, and they weren’t
being dealt with, and the Australian Taxation Office was one of those.
926. I do not find the fact that Mr P’s notes do not record the
instructions that the DODT was a fraud preclude the fraud
and surrounding
context from being discussed.
Email to Mr P, 23 February 2011
927. On 23 February 2011, the husband sent an email to Mr P providing
instructions about the “forgery by [Mr Jess Jnr] [...],
[...] and others”. The husband wrote
Then there is [Mr KK], the CFO of the X Corporation from 2004 to October
2006, at which time he was fired for refusing to sign off
on certain matters
that were requested by [Mr Jess Jnr] during the time of my
hospitalisation, which are referred to in my previous
email of today’s
date. [Mr KK] is also willing to be a witness for me in this matter.
[Mr KK] has raised with me, voluntarily,
a number of matters; one being in
relation to the declaration of trust and the fact that this could not have
happened in 2002 or
at any other time prior to [Mr KK’s] departure in
October 2006 due to the covenants of the bank and the covenants uner the
franchise agreements where the company must provide the franchises a notice of
any change of ownership etc.
928. Neither the husband, or the wife called Mr KK as a witness.
Email to Mr Jess Jnr, 30 May 2011
929. On 28 March 2011, the XC sent an letter to the husband demanding that he
cease and desist from communicating with the Y Business
franchisees or holding
himself out as having authority to deal with the franchisees or any association
with the company
On 30 May 2011, the husband
[Mr Jess Jnr],
I will contact who I like, when I like, about what I like.
You are a liar and a thief.
Email to the wife, 31 March 2011
930. On 31 March 2011, the husband sent an email to the wife which detailed a
plan of action
The email stated:
“We will ask the Court to make a determination on the validity of the
Declaration of Trust as being a fraudulent document created
by some or all of
the above stated directors in the Family Court action between
[Mr Jess Snr] and [Ms Jess], which has been to the
detriment of
our ([Ms Jess] and my) family.
When the matter of the Deed of Trust is resolved it will have the effect of
resolving the ATO claim on [VVV Pty Ltd], which is currently
in excess of $60
million dollars.
I see logically that if these actions are successful then the Y Business will
embrace the brand ZZZ and their products as part of
the authorised products
within the Y Business Retail Franchise System and this would be to my mind a
very small gesture of appreciation
of another family business. I would also seek
you, [Ms Jess] and other persons within the management of ZZZ Pty Ltd to become
and assist in the management of the newly revived Y Business System in
Australia.”
931. The represented third parties submitted that the husband conceded that he
wrote this email as he saw the wife as an ally in
his attempt to regain the
business and avoid the tax liability, the exchange in the witness box occurred
You agree that that is an authentic copy of an email that you sent to
[Ms Jess] at that date, on that- - -?---Well, I can’t
deny it, but I
don’t recall it. But I agree with the contents of it.
Yes. And in this letter you were telling her – proposing to her, really, a
way in which you would cooperate with her to set
aside the deed of declaration
of trust, weren’t you?---No.
Well - - -?---Read the letter, the first line. “My intention”.
I see?---Not her – not our intention. “My intention”.
But why are you telling [Ms Jess] of your intentions at this
time?---Because I’m trying to – I’m communicating
HER HONOUR: But why are you communicating with her in this way?---Well, I
can’t say, your Honour.
932. I accept the represented third parties
submission that from
31 March 2011, the husband and wife actively worked together to set aside the
DODT. I note the evidence that
the wife sent an email to the husband on 27 April
2011 with a detailed chronology
I also note that the
husband met with Mr P on 12 May 2011 where it is recorded in an
invoice “we are going after [Mr Jess Jnr]
to get [the] business
back and pleading it in the
alternative
933. The represented third parties successfully established that the husband
and wife were working together and they had a common
interest. However it does
not follow that the wife and husband are incorrect in arguing that the DODT is a
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnotes
123 To this may be added that at [850] of the 2018 reasons the
primary judge recorded the finding that it was in June 2010 that the
husband had told his solicitor and tax advisor, Mr FF, that the DODT was a
“sham” and a “fraud”.
124 As the wife submits on appeal, it is unremarkable that the husband and
the wife had a common interest and would work together
in respect of the DODT
once the husband had renounced the DODT and each of the settlements reached in
the Supreme Court of Victoria
and the Family Court of Australia. However,
it obviously does not follow axiomatically that the husband and the wife had
“an agreement” that the husband would
that the DODT was a fraud.
125 Put another way, whilst the primary judge accepted the
appellants’ submissions below that the husband and the wife were
together and had a common interest, none of the evidence advanced went further
than that. It did not follow from the fact
of the common interest referred to
that there must have been some “agreement” between the husband and
the wife for the
claim that the DODT was a fraud.
126 It bears emphasis that each of the six events recited at paragraphs 18 to
25 of the appellants’ Outline of Submissions occurred
subsequent to the
husband having already recanted or renounced the DODT as a sham or fraud.
127 We do not see that the letter of 20 December 2010 does any more than that
which the wife contended, namely, to set the foundation
for the collective
action by the husband and the wife to prove that the DODT was a fraud. We do not
see any error concerning the
primary judge’s analysis of the letter
or its effect.
128 With respect to the 22 December 2010 meeting between the husband and his
then family law solicitor, Mr P, the primary judge expressed
satisfaction that it was clear from Mr P’s file note that fraud and
the DODT were discussed at the meeting. There is no apparent
error when regard
is had to the content of Mr P’s note.
129 With respect to the husband’s diary note of 8 January 2011 it is
not apparent that the only plausible explanation of the
subject note is that the
husband had, two days earlier, discussed with the wife the best way to take
steps to set aside the DODT.
The note simply records the husband considering the
prospect of a challenge to the DODT and even if there had been a discussion
the husband and the wife about that, it is entirely consistent with the
position of the husband and the wife in these proceedings.
Plainly, the husband
and the wife had openly proclaimed their common interest by pursuing the finding
in these proceedings that the
DODT was a fraud. It is circular to suggest that
this fact underpins a conclusion that the husband and the wife had reached some
agreement that the husband would
claim that the DODT was a
130 At paragraph 22 of the appellants’ Outline of Submissions,
the appellants complain that with respect to the husband’s
every franchisee alleging that a fraud had been perpetrated, the
primary judge, without giving any reasons, expressed the
conclusion that
she did “not regard these events as probative of the issue at
hand” (at [923] of the 2018 reasons). Read
in context, all that finding
reflects is that the primary judge was not satisfied that simply because
the husband asserted to franchisees
that the DODT was a fraud, that this made it
so. In other words, that it was not probative. The primary judge plainly
regarded the
husband as a fraudster and perjurer. It is unsurprising then that
the primary judge attributed no probative value to the husband’s
protestations to franchisees.
131 The fifth and sixth matters were also addressed in detail by the
primary judge. We do not accept that the primary judge failed
consider the “cumulative effect” of each of the matters addressed in
this complaint.
132 We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 4: Failure to accept that Ms Jess’s case was built
on three foundations
4. The primary judge:
(a) erred in not finding; and/or
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for not finding,
that Ms Jess’s case was built on three foundations ([605] and [606])
in circumstances where, from the commencement of the proceeding
on 3 September
2013, the serious allegation of fraud and dishonesty made by Ms Jess (and
supported by Mr Jess Snr) was founded on
three fundamental premises, namely,
(i) Mr Jess Snr allegedly first saw the DODT when it was shown to him on
27 March 2007, already signed;
(ii) on 31 May 2010 Mr Jess Snr thought that he was going to die and
allegedly confessed to Ms Jess that the DODT was a fraud; and
(iii) Mr MM told Ms Jess that he had retained a hard drive on which
existed a duplicate of Mr Jess Jnr’s laptop which contained
Microsoft Word documents allegedly created on 28 August 2006 by
Ms C Jess and used as a basis for the Dear Dadda
133 From the commencement of the current
proceedings on 3 September 2013 the wife’s central allegation and
contention in the
proceedings was that the DODT was a sham. The wife sought that
the BFA be set aside pursuant to s 90K of the Act on the ground of
that the consent orders be set aside pursuant to s 79A(1) of the Act on the
grounds of fraud and the giving of false evidence;
and that the Deed of
Settlement in relation to the trust proceedings be set aside.
134 On 16 December 2013 the husband filed an affidavit alleging that the DODT
was not genuine. On 22 July 2014 the husband filed a
detailed and lengthy
affidavit alleging that the DODT was a fraud perpetrated by himself,
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban.
135 It was thus clear from the outset of the proceedings that the appellants
were alive to the issue of fraud and it was in respect
of that issue that the
wife bore the onus of proof.
136 As is submitted by the wife on appeal, at the commencement of her case in
2013 the wife obviously did not then have access to
a substantial body of
documentary evidence, nor was she aware of the evidence that could be provided
by a number of witnesses, which
documents and witnesses ultimately assumed
importance in the case. All of those witnesses were called to give evidence at
That is, these witnesses and substantial documentation coming into
the wife’s possession subsequent to the commencement of
the proceedings,
became a substantial part of the wife’s case.
137 Whilst it is correct to say that the primary judge did not find that
the wife’s case was built upon “three foundations”,
persuaded that this demonstrates any error on the part of the
primary judge.
138 The primary judge was obliged to consider each central proposition
raised by the wife and the evidence advanced by the wife in
support of her case.
That evidence obviously included the evidence earlier referred to which came
into the wife’s possession
in the course of the proceedings.
139 Review of the primary judge’s 2018 reasons reflects that the
wife’s case relied upon a multitude of circumstances.
Obviously, the
primary judge did not accept all of the allegations or propositions within
the wife’s case. However, the primary
judge was satisfied that on the
preponderance of evidence she could “conclude comfortably and on the
balance of probabilities,
that the DODT was not executed on the date that it
bears” (at [971 of the 2018 reasons).
140 In these circumstances the contention that the rejection of the
“three foundations” of the wife’s case was not
the subject of
adequate reasons is without any substance.
141 The primary judge was not required to accept each and every
allegation advanced by the wife in order to ultimately conclude the
case in the
wife’s favour. What was required is what occurred, that is, that on the
evidence and circumstances accepted by
the primary judge she reached an
actual persuasion or a comfortable satisfaction of the conclusion ultimately
142 It does not appear that it was part of the wife’s case, from the
opening of her case before the primary judge, that the
husband “first
saw the DODT when it was shown to him on 27 March 2007, already signed”,
as is asserted at paragraph 4(a)(i)
of the grounds of appeal and repeated at
paragraph 26.1 of the appellants’ Outline of Submissions.
The wife’s Outline
of Case for the first part of trial, which
was tendered at the start of the wife’s case on 11 February 2016, contains
the assertion
“the Court is at this point or ‘sitting’ dealing
with the first issue of whether the 2002 DODT is a genuine document
and executed
on the date the purported copy bears” (paragraph 2). That Outline set
out circumstances asserted to be inconsistent
with the genuineness of the DODT.
It asserts “[a]ccording to [Mr CC] he does not see it until [Mr Ban]
provides a copy to him
or [sic] either 21 on 22 Feb 2007. If correct
[Mr Jess Snr] is mistaken in his recollection that the creation of the
2002 DODT occurred
on 27 March 2007” (paragraph 18). That
Outline further asserts that “[i]t is immaterial whether the 2002 DODT was
in January or February or March 2007” (paragraph 19).
143 Even if this had been part of the wife’s case nothing turns on
this. It is incorrect to characterise the wife’s case
as relying solely
upon the “three foundations” contended for. The wife was required to
prove fraud and the primary judge
was satisfied that she proved that
allegation for all of the reasons set out in the 2018 reasons.
144 The wife contends on appeal as to the second asserted
“foundation” that the precise date in 2010 that the husband
told the wife that the DODT was a sham has minimal significance in the context
that there is no issue that by 17 June 2010 the husband
had told his tax lawyer,
Mr FF, that the DODT “is a sham”. We accept that
submission.
145 Further, we also accept that it is of minimal significance as to whether
the husband was correct or honest about his own opinion
of his health in 2010 at
the time of his “confession” of fraud to the wife. No reliance was
placed by the primary judge
on the evidence of the husband given that on
his own evidence he is a fraudster and perjurer as the wife contends.
146 Mr MM was a contractor to XC as an information technology specialist
who was called to give evidence in the wife’s case.
It is true that the
wife relied upon the evidence of Mr MM but the primary judge found
this evidence to be unreliable. That is simply
another example of one aspect of
the wife’s case not succeeding but it was not, obviously, the only aspect
or a fundamental
matter that had to be proved in order for the wife to
147 The contention within this ground of appeal that the primary judge
failed to provide adequate reasons with respect to the asserted
foundations” is unsustainable. At [605] of the 2018 reasons the
primary judge considered the “three foundations”
proposition raised in closing submissions by the appellants. The
primary judge recited these “three foundations” and
observed at
[606] of the 2018 reasons that the wife’s case was not so structured.
Nevertheless, the primary judge thereafter
addressed the substance of the
first foundation (at [607]–[613] of the 2018 reasons); the second
foundation (at [934]–[964]
of the 2018 reasons); and the third foundation
(at [461]–[525] of the 2018 reasons). The primary judge’s
findings and
reasons in relation to each of those matters was detailed.
148 It can thus be seen that whilst the primary judge did not accept
that the wife’s case was “structured” in the
manner alleged,
the primary judge nevertheless dealt in detail with the substance of each
“foundation”.
149 This ground of appeal has no substance.
Ground 5: Failure to give proper weight to the demolition of Mr
Jess Snr’s evidence
5. Given the primary judge’s finding
that “the husband’s credibility was demolished by the represented
third parties”
[(969)], the primary
judge erred
(a) accepting the wife’s submission that “nothing turned on
whether the husband knew about the DODT on 27 March or before
the meeting with
Mr EE on 15 March 2007” ([613]);
(b) finding that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban had concocted the DODT and the
Dear Dadda letter as part of a “game plan” to
prevent Ms Jess
“from gaining control of XC” [607]-[612];
(c) finding that “the husband became aware of the DODT in early
2007” ([813]);
(d) finding that the deathbed confession was “incidental and goes
mainly to the husband’s character, rather than to whether
or not the fraud
occurred” ([953]); and
(e) finding that, notwithstanding her acceptance that Mr Jess Snr was
motivated to allege fraud “because of his tax assessment”
and “saw alleging fraud to avoid the tax bill as in his interests”
([861]), “this does not mean that [the]
DODT was not a fraud”
6. The primary judge:
(a) erred in finding, without any evidentiary foundation;
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
that “unscrupulous and dishonest conduct” gave rise to the
DODT ([968]), particularly in circumstances where the represented
third parties
successfully proved that Mr Jess Snr’s evidence in relation to the alleged
events of 27 March 2007 and the deathbed
confession was
150 It was implicit in the wife’s case that
the husband is a person prepared to commit fraud and to perjure himself. In this
context it follows that there was no part of the wife’s case that depended
upon the husband being accepted as a credible witness.
151 At [66] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge recorded in her
discussion about the husband and his credibility the following:
66. The husband was not a reliable witness. He
self-identified as someone who had been prepared to give false evidence when he
it to be in his interests to do so. The husband had no regard for
right and wrong and disregarded the rights and feelings of other
people. His
post-separation treatment of the wife, including accusations which led her to
face criminal charges, stealing her jewellery
and causing her to be humiliated
in public and in the press, was brutish. Where he did exhibit consideration for
some people, conspicuously
my impression is
that at he did so because he regarded Mr Ban as an extension of himself rather
than an individual with whom he empathised.
The husband had an engaging but
manipulative personality.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnote
152 The primary judge made it clear that little to no reliance would be
placed on the evidence of the husband.
153 At [71] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge recorded:
71. Of course, unreliable witnesses give truthful
evidence, they just do not do so consistently. My lack of confidence in the
veracity means that, where his evidence conflicts with the evidence of
other witnesses or documentary evidence, I have regard to
all circumstances and
weigh the strength of the contradictory evidence when being satisfied to a
balance of probabilities.
The lack of veracity of other witnesses, including
but not limited to the represented third parties who gave evidence and were
examined, made for a parlous choice.
(Emphasis added)
154 Clearly the primary judge took the approach that little to no
reliance would be placed upon the evidence of the husband unless
corroborated or there existed plausible independent evidence. It would seem then
that rather than failing to give proper weight
to the demolition of the
husband’s evidence the primary judge was correct in the approach
155 The finding at [71] quoted above reflects that the demolition of the
husband’s credibility was not taken to have the consequence
absolutely any evidence he gave had to be taken to be untruthful. We accept the
submission of the wife that an adverse finding
as to credibility does not equate
to a positive finding that the whole of the evidence of a witness is untruthful
and the opposite
proposition is therefore proven (
Crick & Bennett
[2018] FamCAFC 68
(2018) FLC 93-832).
156 It bears emphasis in this context that the primary judge made
significantly adverse credit findings about not only the husband
various witnesses called in the case of the appellants including
Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban and Ms C Jess.
157 On the wife’s case she was a victim of fraud. She could not give
direct evidence about the creation of the DODT. Only the
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban could so do. However, in the face of a finding
that each of those witnesses was unreliable the primary
judge correctly
gave little or no weight to the evidence of any of them concerning the creation
of the DODT. Rather it can be seen
that the primary judge undertook a
careful assessment of surrounding events including the behaviour of each of
those witnesses that
was found to be inconsistent with the creation of the DODT
on the date which it bears.
158 We do not consider that it can be said that the wife’s case turned
upon the precise date in 2007 upon which the husband
became aware of the
existence of the DODT. We have earlier addressed, in dealing with Ground 4, our
rejection of the proposition
that the precise date was fundamental to the
wife’s case. We are not persuaded that any error attends the
primary judge having
found, notwithstanding the adverse findings concerning
the husband’s credibility, that nothing turned on whether the husband
159 It does not follow that because the primary judge made adverse
findings as to the husband’s credibility that the primary
in error in finding that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban had concocted the DODT
and the Dear Dadda letter. As already referred to,
the fact that a witness
making an allegation is found to be lacking in credibility does not result in
the conclusion that any allegation
made by that witness is false. The
primary judge properly considered all of the evidence, and weighed the
evidence in a detailed
and careful way, in reaching the conclusions her Honour
reached about the concoction by Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban of the relevant
160 Aside from the evidence of the husband there was an evidentiary
foundation for the finding that the husband had become aware of
the DODT in
early 2007 as found by the primary judge (at [813] of the 2018 reasons).
That foundation included the fact that on 19
December 2006 the husband had
attended a meeting with his solicitors in the first family law proceedings where
the husband was said
to own 100 per cent of the business “less
trusts” in circumstances where it would clearly have been in his interests
to disclose that Mr Jess Jnr had become entitled to those units (at
[633] of the 2018 reasons). The primary judge, in discussing
husband’s meeting on 15 March 2007 with Mr EE, the lawyer acting for
Mr Jess Jnr in the trust proceedings, recorded at
[813] of the 2018
813. I accept that this meeting is another example of
the husband knowing about the DODT before 27 March 2007. On the balance of
evidence regarding the meetings with the divorce lawyers I am satisfied that the
husband became aware of the DODT in early 2007.
I find that the husband’s
comments at this meeting are representative of the fact that he, at this point
in time, was happily
complicit in the fraud that is the DODT. Further, the
meeting with Mr EE is the first point in time where I am completely
that the husband was an active participant in presenting the DODT as
161 The primary judge’s finding that the husband’s alleged
death bed confession was “incidental and goes mainly
husband’s character, rather than to whether or not the fraud
occurred” (at [953] of the 2018 reasons) is not demonstrated
erroneous simply because of the primary judge’s findings concerning
the lack of the husband’s credibility. Indeed
it would seem that this
finding is consistent with the primary judge’s assessment of the
husband’s credibility.
162 To similar effect it does not follow that because the husband was
motivated to allege fraud because of his taxation liability
that the DODT itself
was not a fraud. The 2018 reasons reflect that the primary judge was keenly
aware of the existence of the taxation
liability and the motivation that it
provided. Plainly it was a factor that the primary judge weighed in the
balance in reaching
the conclusions reached.
163 We are not persuaded that the primary judge failed to give proper
weight to the demolition of the husband’s evidence. The
primary judge
gave extensive and detailed reasons for the ultimate conclusion reached. When
the 2018 reasons are reviewed it can
be seen that the primary judge had to
weigh the husband’s lack of credibility, together with the lack of
credibility of each
of the central witnesses including Mr Jess Jnr and
Mr Ban, in the balance with all of the other evidence considered.
164 We are not persuaded of any merit in this complaint.
Ground 6: Failure to find that the Microsoft Word documents
were created in aid of Ms Jess’s case
7. Given that the primary judge found that
Mr MM was an evasive ([495]), dishonest ([498]) and unreliable witness whose
evidence she
did not accept ([507]), the primary judge erred
(a) not finding that Mr MM created the Microsoft Documents
(b) not finding that, on a balance of probabilities, Ms Jess and Mr Jess
Snr put up Mr MM to give the evidence in his affidavit and
fabricate the
computer media referred to in that affidavit ([498]); and
(c) finding that “[t]he represented third parties did
not...sufficiently show that the wife or Mr MM was cognisant of the information
which was included in the two Microsoft word documents”
165 The Microsoft Word documents referred
to in this complaint were two letters that bore similarities to the
Dear Dadda letter and
the controversy at trial concerned the provenance of
those letters.
166 In essence, the wife contended that these letters had been authored by
Ms C Jess and Mr Jess Jnr in 2006 and that, subsequently,
the Dear Dadda letter was created to look like it was written in 2002.
167 Ms C Jess and Mr Jess Jnr each denied the
wife’s contentions in this respect. It bears emphasis that this was the
concerning the Microsoft Word documents, that is, whether they
were drafted in 2006 or not.
168 The appellants submitted ultimately to the primary judge that the
Court could not rely on the two Microsoft Word documents. They
that Mr MM had probably destroyed the evidence which would have shown that
the computer metadata relied upon by the wife
was created and manipulated by him
to support her case.
169 The obvious purpose of the appellants’ submissions in respect of
the Microsoft Word documents was to reject any contention
to the effect
that Ms C Jess had drafted those documents. In the result the
primary judge did reject that evidence and did not rely
Microsoft Word documents in making her central findings.
170 Of critical importance to the complaint now raised on appeal is the
feature that the appellants did not seek a finding at first
instance that either
the husband and/or the wife had “put up Mr MM” to give
fabricated evidence. It can be accepted that
applying the rule in
Browne v Dunn
(1893) 6 R 67 (
“Browne v Dunn”
appellants could not properly have sought that finding without that very serious
allegation being put to each of the husband,
the wife and Mr MM.
171 It is not open to the appellants to argue on appeal, against that
background, that error arises from some failure by the primary
make a finding that was not sought by any party at trial. That is particularly
so when the nature of the finding is as serious
as that now articulated,
requiring proof in accordance with
Evidence Act 1995
Whilst the primary judge recorded an “impression” that
Mr MM was put up to give certain evidence “and was
fearful of letting
down whoever who had put him up to give evidence” (at [498] of the 2018
reasons), in circumstances where
the primary judge was not asked to draw
any conclusions, as the appellants had not asked her to, the primary judge
correctly did
not express any relevant conclusions.
172 The matters particularised at paragraph 46 of the appellants’
Outline of Submissions simply demonstrate the basis upon which
primary judge rejected the evidence of Mr MM. We accept the submission
of the wife that these matters do not, individually or
taken as a whole,
constitute positive proof that Mr MM created or copied the Microsoft Word
documents or that he destroyed exculpatory
173 The appellants advanced no evidence before the primary judge to
establish that the wife was complicit in putting Mr MM up to giving
fabricated evidence. As already noted, that proposition was not put to the wife.
The conclusion the primary judge expressed at [525]
of the 2018 reasons on
this topic was in these terms:
525. It is conceded by the wife that there was
“difficulties” in establishing the chain of custody, evidence about
drive, the green USB and the various discs. The wife acknowledged that the
Microsoft Word documents were not alone sufficient to
discharge the
Evidence Act
burden of proof. However, coupled with other evidence, and
despite the chain of custody problems, that it was still “by far
likely explanation” that the Microsoft Word documents were authored by
Ms C Jess and Mr Jess Jnr in 2006. Given the
inconsistency
in the evidence, the fact that metadata can be easily manipulated and the highly
questionable role of Mr MM, I accept
the represented third
submission that there was no proper evidentiary basis for
the wife to submit that Ms C Jess had authored the Microsoft Word
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original)
174 We accept the wife’s submission on appeal at paragraph 116 of the
wife’s Summary of Argument filed on 28 September
2020 as follows:
116. It was entirely open to the primary judge to
find that ‘
[t]he represented third parties did not...sufficiently show
that the [wife] or [Mr MM] was cognisant of the information which was
included in the two Microsoft Word documents.
’ None of the matters
outlined at [48] of the Appellants’ Summary of Argument render that
finding erroneous. In particular:
(a) creation of documents is quite plainly a different exercise from
manipulation of metadata. Unlike manipulation of metadata, creation
of documents
requires knowledge of their contents;
(b) the failure of the primary judge to draw the inferences invited by the
Appellants or otherwise accede to the contents of their
closing submissions does
not constitute appealable error. This is particularly so when the invited
inferences are based on speculation,
as is the case with the inferences invited
at [290] and [291] of the Appellants’ closing submissions;
(c) the evidence pointed to by the Appellants demonstrates no more than that the
[wife] was, by the time of the hearing, aware of
the contents of the
Dear Dadda letter and the Microsoft Word documents. This does not
demonstrate that she had knowledge of the contents
of the Microsoft Word
documents at the time of their creation;
(d) the evidence to the effect that the [wife] received a typewritten version of
the Dear Dadda letter after she received the handwritten
version is wholly
irrelevant to the impugned finding; and
(e) likewise, concessions made by the [wife] as to hypothetical possibilities do
not demonstrate that she was cognisant of the information
which was included in
the two Microsoft Word documents and thus are irrelevant to this ground.
(Footnotes omitted) (Emphasis in the original)
175 This ground fails.
Ground 7: Failure to find that the DODT was executed on the
date it bears
8. Given her finding that it was “very
plausible ... that the husband is complicit with the wife in seeking to have the
set aside so as to extinguish his taxation liability” ([21]), the
primary judge erred in finding that it was “implausible”
the DODT was executed on the date that it bears ([22]) and in the manner in
which the DODT was said by the represented third
parties to be brought into
existence ([969]). Taking all of the relevant evidence into account, the later
findings are glaringly
improbable and contrary to the compelling inference that
the DODT was executed on the date that it bears.
9. The primary judge erred in failing to place any weight on the
concession made by Mr Jess Snr in cross-examination that he may have
been in the
office on the morning of 28 February 2002 ([236]), notwithstanding his extensive
sworn affidavit evidence that he was
not there on that date.
10. The primary judge erred in finding that “it too far-fetched
that the husband would have been motivated to insert Mr Jess
Jnr as CEO and then
transfer ownership and control to him if it became profitable” ([205]).
Taking all of the relevant evidence
into account, the primary judge ought
to have found, on the balance of probabilities, that in February 2002 Mr Jess
Snr was concerned
the only person whom he could trust to assume the role of CEO and
had no option
but to enter into the arrangement documented in the DODT so that Mr Jess Jnr
would take on the role of CEO, although
he never expected Mr Jess Jnr to meet
the target.
176 In our judgment review of this ground and
the written and oral submissions in support of it reveal several important
177 First, the appellants invite this Court to undertake a review of not all
relevant evidence, or all relevant findings of fact of
the primary judge,
but rather to take a selective approach and to predominate evidence favourable
to the appellants’ case,
and the findings supportive of that case.
178 Second, this Court is invited to proffer essentially a second, and
different, opinion about selected evidence to that of the primary
rather than focusing upon appellable error on the part of the
primary judge.
179 Third, the appellants complain that the primary judge did not attach
determinative weight to identified aspects of the evidence
the appellants seek
to emphasise. In this respect the essence of the complaint is not that the
primary judge failed to have regard
to material evidence, but rather failed
to give the evidence appropriate weight.
180 In short, this ground of appeal is in reality a weight challenge.
181 As we have already discussed, the primary judge’s finding of
plausibility concerning the husband being motivated to extinguish
his taxation
liability does not render the primary judge’s ultimate conclusion
“glaringly improbable” or “contrary
to compelling
inferences”. It did not follow that the DODT must be authentic. It was
open to the primary judge to conclude
that the DODT was a fraud and that
the husband felt motivated to reveal that fraud because of his tax
182 The appellants contend that the primary judge correctly found that
the husband’s concession that he may have been in the
office on 28
February 2002 was significant. This would appear to mischaracterise the
primary judge’s finding expressed at [235]
of the 2018 reasons
in these terms:
235. The husband’s concession was significant in
terms of the amount of evidence that was devoted to whether or not he had an
opportunity to execute the DODT as alleged. However, it is not significant in
terms of the husband’s credit because I have
already found him not to be a
credible witness.
183 It is clear from that finding as expressed that the primary judge
saw the significance of the concession as going to an issue
as to credit. The
primary judge was not emphasising the significance of the concession as
determinative of the authenticity of the
184 It is not open to doubt that there existed a body of evidence, and indeed
a number of findings of the primary judge, in relation
to that evidence
consistent with the conclusion that the DODT was authentic. However, that
feature does not render the primary judge’s
ultimate conclusion, on
all of the evidence considered, that the DODT was fraudulent, an erroneous
conclusion or provide any legitimate
basis for this Court to substitute its own
conclusion. Rather, this serves to demonstrate that the primary judge
weighed competing
evidence in reaching that conclusion.
185 For example, the appellants emphasised their case that the creation and
execution of the DODT arose against the background of
the precarious financial
position of XC and the Dear Dadda letter in that context and the
termination of Mr WW as CEO. The appellants’
case was, in summary and
paraphrased form, that the husband instructed Mr Ban to draft the DODT:
(a) Pursuant to his desire to keep XC in the family;
(b) To rectify the precarious financial position of XC with
Mr Jess Jnr acting as CEO which would in turn protect the
personal financial position; and
(c) At Mr Jess Jnr’s prompting given the terms of the
Dear Dadda letter.
186 Obviously that background was consistent with the DODT having been
brought into existence from 28 February 2002 and the primary
judge can be
seen to have given them or each of those circumstances appropriate
consideration. For example, the primary judge accepted
financial position was precarious (at [161] of the 2018 reasons) and that the
husband wanted to draw Mr Jess Jnr
into the business (at [172] of the
2018 reasons).
187 We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 8: Failure to find that Dear Dadda Letter was
written on 2 February 2002
11. The primary judge’s finding that
“not much turns on the Dear Dadda letter, per se, if I find (as I do)
that the DODT
was not signed in 2002” ([188]) demonstrates that her Honour
had erroneously reached a decision concerning the date on which
the DODT was
signed without first giving adequate consideration to the Dear Dadda
12. The primary judge
(a) erred in finding, without any evidentiary foundation;
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
that the Dear Dadda letter was a “document manufactured to be
evidence in a case” ([187]) and “a document constructed
authenticity to the DODT” ([188]). Taking all of the relevant evidence
into account, the finding is glaringly improbable
and contrary to the compelling
inference that the Dear Dadda letter was written on 2 February 2002.
13. The primary judge:
(a) erred in finding, without any evidentiary foundation;
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
that “it seems unusual that the Dear Dadda letter was
circulated as the protagonists say it was” [187]. The finding is
to the evidence of the close relationship between Mr Jess Snr and Mr
188 From [173] to [188] of the 2018 reasons,
commencing with setting out the text of the Dear Dadda letter in full, the
primary judge
addresses that topic and the evidence in relation to it,
including that of the key witnesses, the husband, Mr Jess Jnr and Mr
That discussion must also be considered in the context, as already referred
to, that the primary judge made seriously adverse credit
concerning each of Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban.
189 We find no error in the primary judge’s conclusion that
“[n]ot much turns on the Dear Dadda letter, perse [sic], if
(as I do) that the DODT was not signed in 2002” (at [188] of the
2018 reasons). Once the evidence of Mr Jess Jnr and
Mr Ban could
not be relied upon, there was no evidence to demonstrate that the
Dear Dadda letter was written on the date that it
bears. It followed from
the primary judge’s process of reasoning to the finding that the DODT
had been manufactured as a fraudulent
document that the accompanying
Dear Dadda letter was in the same category.
190 The matters agitated at paragraphs 62.1 to 62.3 of the appellants’
Outline of Submissions do not demonstrate that the primary
finding in relation to the DODT amounted to “mere conjecture”.
The matters raised are simply an attempt
to re-agitate the same matters that
were argued before the primary judge on the basis that the appellants do
not agree with the finding
that the primary judge reached. They do not
demonstrate that the primary judge’s findings are “glaringly
improbable”
or “contrary to compelling inferences”. The
findings were open on the evidence accepted by the primary judge.
191 The balance of the complaints agitated in support of this ground serve
only to demonstrate that the primary judge gave proper
consideration to
those aspects of the evidence which were consistent with the appellants’
case in reasoning to the conclusions
her Honour reached.
192 We are not persuaded of any error on the part of the primary judge
as sought to be contended by anything raised by the appellants
in support of
this complaint. This ground has no substance.
Ground 9: Erroneous findings regarding the evidence leading up
to Mr Jess Jnr’s appointment as CEO
14. The primary judge erred in failing to
give adequate weight to Mr Jess Jnr’s unchallenged evidence regarding his
discussions
with Mr Jess Snr preceding his appointment as CEO ([171] and [172]),
which discussions were consistent with the arrangement documented
15. Having found that Mr Jess Snr “was wholly in the wife’s
camp and oppositional to the interests of Mr Jess Jnr”
“wholly supportive of the wife’s application” ([17]), the
primary judge erred in finding that Ms Jess
could not directly challenge Mr
Jess Jnr’s evidence regarding the discussions preceding his appointment as
CEO ([171] and [172]).
193 Commencing at [156] of the
2018 reasons, the primary judge addressed the topic “[e]vents leading
to 28 February 2002”.
At [161] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge
recorded the following finding:
161. I accept that XC was in a precarious financial
state in the early 2000’s compared to the profits made under
Mr Jess Jnr’s
leadership as CEO. Mr Jess Jnr becoming
CEO in 2002 was not inconsistent with the DODT having been in existence from 28
2002 but it is not conclusive evidence.
194 At [171] and [172] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge recorded
the following:
171. In the represented third parties
closing submissions, Mr Jess Jnr’s unchallenged evidence
regarding the discussions he had with the husband preceding his appointment
CEO are summarised as follows (transcript references
47.1. [Mr Jess Snr] said to him that:
(a) it was time to set in place a succession plan and for
[Mr Jess Jnr] to take over the business;
(b) if [Mr Jess Jnr] agreed to take on the role of CEO he would
transfer his ownership to [Mr Jess Jnr] if a certain outcome was
achieved that proved [Mr Jess Jnr’s] ability to manage the
business; and
(c) he would like to offer [Mr Jess Jnr] his equity in the business in
return for [Mr Jess Jnr] turning the business around and that
could agree a benchmark whereby if [Mr Jess Jnr] proved himself then
the company would be his;
47.2. [Mr Jess Jnr] said that he needed to see what
[Mr Jess Snr] was talking about; and
47.3. they continued to discuss the basis upon which he would formally take on
the role of CEO of XC but nothing was resolved.
172. The lack of direct challenge to evidence does not make the evidence true.
In this proceeding, the wife labours under the difficulty
that she was not a
party to the conversations between the husband and Mr Jess Jnr. In any
event, the above points, taken at the highest,
are merely consistent with
Mr Jess Jnr’s assertion that the husband wanted to draw
Mr Jess Jnr into the business. They are
not persuasive of the husband
being prepared to commit to an arrangement equivalent to that documented by the
DODT that is passing
the ownership of the business to Mr Jess Jnr.
(Tracked changes in original) (Footnote omitted)
195 There cannot be anything contentious about the primary judge’s
finding set out above that “[t]he lack of direct challenge
to evidence
does not make the evidence true” (at [172] of the 2018 reasons).
Undoubtedly, on all of the evidence, Mr Jess Jnr
was seeking that the
husband commit to securing Mr Jess Jnr’s position in the
business. The primary judge properly considered
that aspect.
196 Whilst, even accepting Mr Jess Jnr’s version of the
discussions, these are not inconsistent with the existence of the DODT,
not positively establish its authenticity. The primary judge can be seen to
have weighed all of the evidence in reaching
the conclusion that she did.
197 The proposition that the wife could challenge the evidence because she
and the husband were “in the same camp” misconstrues
the finding
that the primary judge made. All that the primary judge was referring
to was the fact that because the wife was not a
party to any of the discussions
that transpired between Mr Jess Jnr and the husband preceding
Mr Jess Jnr’s appointment as
CEO, the wife could make no direct
challenge to Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence on this topic.
198 We are not persuaded that the primary judge made any erroneous
findings as contended for in this ground and it is rejected.
Ground 10: Erroneous finding that there was no evidence of the
DODT before 2006
16. Notwithstanding all of the relevant evidence,
including in particular the unchallenged evidence of Mr Z, Mr Y and
Mr EE, the primary
judge erred in finding that there was no credible
evidence of the existence of the DODT before 2006
199 We have earlier set out in full the
conclusions that the primary judge expressed at [965]–[971] of the
2018 reasons and
will not replicate that here. The point of emphasis is that, as
those conclusions reflect, the primary judge did not make a specific
finding as to there being no evidence of the existence of the DODT before 2006.
Rather, as expressed in those conclusions, the primary
judge considered
that there was no plausible evidence or credible evidence or evidence which the
primary judge was prepared to accept
demonstrating the existence of the
DODT before 2006.
200 Reference has already been made to the fact that the primary judge
gave extensive consideration to the evidence of each of Mr
and Mr Ban, but determined that their evidence was not credible and it was
expressly rejected. It was plainly open to the
primary judge to so do. At
[149] of the 2018 reasons, the primary judge specifically rejected
Ms C Jess’s evidence as to having
seen the DODT and discussed it
with Mr Jess Jnr in 2002 or 2003. The primary judge recorded a
series of findings concerning Ms C
Jess and why her evidence was not
accepted (see, for example, at [129]–[149] of the 2018 reasons).
Notably, the primary judge
recorded that she had the opportunity to observe
Ms C Jess give evidence for a period in excess of four hours (at [135]
of the 2018
reasons). The 2018 reasons reflect that the primary judge gave
careful and detailed consideration to Ms C Jess’s evidence,
did not accept Ms C Jess’s evidence for reasons cogently
201 Reference has also been made to Mr V in the context of the above
discussion concerning Management accounts. Whilst the appellants
submit that
Mr V was “unshaken in cross- examination”, the fact is
that, as recorded by the primary judge, Mr V, a professional,
record of the meeting with Mr Jess Jnr discussed in his affidavit
prepared more than seven years later (at [313] of the 2018
reasons). As the
primary judge recorded, Mr V did not seek to consult his files in
advance of giving oral evidence “even though
he was aware there were going
to be questions about his recollection” (at [313] of the
2018 reasons). Whilst the primary judge
obviously did not accept
Mr V’s version that Mr Jess Jnr informed him of the DODT in
December 2006, it is obvious that even
if that evidence were accepted, it does
not prove the existence of the DODT prior to December 2006.
202 In the result, the primary judge recorded that she afforded
Mr V’s evidence little weight and it was open to her to so do.
203 The 2018 reasons reflect that the primary judge likewise gave
detailed consideration to the evidence of Mr CC, solicitor for XC
husband, including detailed reasons for rejecting his veracity as a witness
(at [534]–[540] and [671]–[675] of
the 2018 reasons). This
included the observations at [538] of the 2018 reasons that:
538. ... Mr CC was a frustrating witness. He
regularly answered questions with a monologue, sometimes deviating largely from
the question.
His evidence was selective and obfuscatory. He would often,
seemingly deliberately, misunderstand questions asked of him in
cross-examination
in an effort to avoid answering difficult
questions...
204 No error on the part of the primary judge is demonstrated with
respect to the primary judge’s finding, having seen and heard
Mr CC give evidence, that he was not a reliable witness.
205 Observations to similar effect can be made in relation to the
primary judge’s non-acceptance of the evidence of Ms LL. The
primary judge referred to Ms LL changing her evidence under
cross-examination (at [351] of the 2018 reasons); observed that Ms LL
“less than frank” (at [367] of the 2018 reasons) and had made a
“significant omission” in failing to
disclose the extent of her
involvement with Mr Jess Jnr (at [349] of the 2018 reasons); and
recorded a finding that Ms LL “deliberately
delivered her evidence to
conceal the true nature of her working relationship with Mr Jess Jnr
and in order to appear more credible
on the issue of whether
Mr Jess Jnr revealed the DODT to her in 2005” (at [357] of the
2018 reasons).
206 We accept the submission of the third respondent that neither Mr Y
nor Mr Z gave evidence that could have established the existence
DODT before 2006. Mr Y’s evidence was that:
Between April 2002 and 2005 [Mr Jess Jnr] rang up to
speak with me about an issue. Subsequently we had a meeting at
[X Advisors’]
offices. During the meeting I asked him how things were
going. [Mr Jess Jnr] said that his father’s health was better.
told me during that meeting that he had “done a deal” with
his father and he was “comfortable” with his future.
(Affidavit of Mr Y filed on 27 August 2014, paragraph
207 Mr Z’s evidence was:
In the second half of 2002 I recall initiating a
conversation with [Mr Jess Jnr] encouraging him to secure his
arrangements with his
father in order to protect him from his father’s
propensity to change his mind over time. [Mr Jess Jnr] thanked me for
my interest
and said that he had reached an agreement with his father which
addressed the issue that I had raised.
(Affidavit of Mr Z filed on 27 August 2014, paragraph
208 Neither of these statements demonstrated the existence of the DODT,
specifically or even generally. Put another way, on the evidence
Mr Y and Mr Z, neither deposed to discussions with
Mr Jess Jnr specifically about the DODT or about Mr Jess Jnr
the husband’s interests in the X business.
209 Moreover, we interpolate here that there appears to be something of an
internal inconsistency in the appellants’ case in
this context. The
general thrust of the appellants’ case was that Mr Jess Jnr and
Mr Ban were under instructions not to reveal
the existence of the DODT and that
feature was relied upon to explain why no lawyers were informed about the
existence of the DODT.
Yet the complaint here is that Mr Jess Jnr is
said to have revealed the existence of the DODT to his bookkeeper Ms LL;
the auditor
Mr V; the liquidator Mr Y; and Mr Z a chartered
accountant.
210 The primary judge did not accept that Mr Jess Jnr
canvassed the DODT with lawyers before 2006 and considered it something of a
contradiction that Mr Jess Jnr would tell his accountant to prepare
for impending work but would not discuss the DODT with a lawyer
(at [395] of the
2018 reasons).
211 In relation to Mr EE, his evidence was simply that the husband had
told him in 2007 that the DODT had been executed. Plainly,
that is not evidence
of the existence of the DODT prior to 2006.
212 The primary judge was obliged to consider the whole of the evidence,
not simply the evidence relied upon by the appellants as
indicative of the
existence of the DODT prior to 2006.
213 We are not persuaded of error on the part of the primary judge in
her Honour determining, upon a review of all relevant and sometimes
evidence, that there was no credible, plausible or acceptable evidence that the
DODT existed before 2006.
Ground 11: Erroneous finding that the DODT was not referred to
at the meeting on 19 December 2006
17. The primary judge erred in finding,
without any evidentiary foundation, that “Mr P had some independent
recollection of
the 19 December 2006 meeting” and that his “evidence
in combination with Ms Q’s notes establishes that the DODT
“raised and discussed” at the 19 December 2006 meeting” ([655]
and [664]). The finding is contrary to the
evidence of Mr P in relation to
his recollection of the meeting and the evidence of Ms Q about the meeting and
214 At [622] of the 2018 reasons the primary
judge records that Mr P is a specialist family lawyer who acted for the
husband in the
first family law proceedings. Mr P’s evidence
concerned a series of meetings, emails and telephone calls between the husband,
Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban, Mr CC and Mr M, counsel retained by the
husband in the first family law proceedings. The focus of this ground
the 19 December 2006 meeting, being the first meeting between Mr P and the
husband and described as an introductory meeting.
It occurred in the context
that the wife’s urgent application for spousal maintenance was to be heard
two days later on 21
December 2006. Aside from Mr P and the husband, also
in attendance at that meeting was Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban and Ms Q, a
in the employ of Mr P’s firm who took notes of the
215 The essence of the complaint in this ground is directed to the
primary judge’s finding that the DODT “was not ‘raised
and discussed’” at the meeting on 19 December 2006 (at [655] of the
2018 reasons). The primary judge records that “Mr
challenged in a sustained period of cross-examination” (at [623] of the
2018 reasons). Indeed, in what appears as another
example of the lack of economy
in this case, the transcript reflects that Mr P was subjected to
cross-examination for in excess of
10 hours whilst Ms Q was cross-examined
for almost 10 hours. We interpolate here that the extent and subject matter of
the cross-examination
of Mr P and Ms Q, relevant to the 19 December
2006 meeting, renders inconsequential any suggestion that, in breach of the rule
Browne v Dunn
, Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were not on notice of
this issue.
216 The 2018 reasons reflect that the primary judge undertook a detailed
examination of, and provided extensive discussion of, the
meeting (at [614]–[644] of the 2018 reasons), the evidence relevant
to that topic including transcript references
and the impressions the
primary judge formed of Mr P and Ms Q as witnesses. That
examination and discussion was obviously informed
by the opportunity the
primary judge had to hear and see each of Mr P and Ms Q
respectively give their evidence over extended periods
of cross-examination.
217 At [623] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge recorded:
623. Mr P was challenged in a sustained period of
cross-examination. I found him to be a careful and Courteous witness, who made
appropriate
concessions in a dignified manner. The represented third parties
submitted that Mr P did not make appropriate concessions. They said
whilst Mr P “conceded” that he had no independent recollection
of the 19 December 2006 meeting, he refused to concede
even the possibility that
the DODT may have been raised at this meeting. Mr P was steadfast that the
DODT was not raised at this
meeting, as demonstrated by the below transcript
Now, [Mr P], what instructions, if any, did you receive about a deed of
declaration of trust on 19 December 2006?---None.
When do you say you first received instructions as opposed to seeing a document,
receive instructions about the deed of declaration
of trust?---The afternoon of
30 January 2007.
Now, [Mr P], what [Mr Jess Jnr] there says – positively
swears – Is that, at that meeting, the deed of declaration of
raised and discussed.
Now, I put to you that that is, in fact, what occurred?---I don’t agree
with you, Mr Strum.
Can only be read in the context of you having been told there was a deed of
declaration of trust?---And I told you no.

218 The primary judge recorded a finding that “Mr P was
steadfast in his view that he was not told about the DODT at the 19
2006” meeting (at [626] of the 2018 reasons), and the primary judge
ultimately concluded that she found Mr P to be
“a truthful
witness” (at [627] of the 2018 reasons).
219 The primary judge’s findings concerning Mr P were open to
be made on his affidavit and oral evidence. At paragraph 16 of
his affidavit
filed on 10 August 2016, Mr P specifically deposed that there was “no
mention whatsoever that the units in the
unit trust and/or the company that
conducted the business was owned at all or in any way by the son
[Mr Jess Jnr]” and “[t]here
was no mention that
[Mr Jess Snr] had at some time previously executed a deed of
declaration of trust whereby he held his units...on
[Mr Jess Jnr]”. Mr P addressed the DODT deposing that he
was familiar with it and said that there was no mention
of such a document when
instructions were provided at the 19 December 2006 meeting. Clearly the
primary judge was entitled to prefer
the evidence of Mr P over that of
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban.
220 Mr P’s evidence was reinforced by notes of Ms Q taken at
the meeting which recorded that the husband “owns all shares”
did not contain any reference to the DODT, as referred to by the
primary judge at [634] of the 2018 reasons.
221 The primary judge found Ms Q to be “an impressive and
impartial witness”, and that whilst her notes were not “word
word records of the meetings”, the primary judge found that Ms Q
was also “a truthful witness” (at [641] of
222 Notably the primary judge considered the content of invoices
rendered by Mr P’s firm, which were consistent with there being
mention of the DODT at the initial meeting on 19 December 2006, but at the
next meeting at the end of January 2007 (at [658]–[660]
of the 2018
223 The 2018 reasons reflect that the primary judge undertook a detailed
examination of, and provided extensive discussion of, the
meeting, the evidence relevant to that topic, and the impressions the
primary judge formed of Mr P and Ms Q respectively
as witnesses
(at [614]–[644] of the 2018 reasons). That examination and discussion was
informed by the opportunity the primary
judge had to hear and see Mr P
and Ms Q give evidence over extensive periods of cross-examination.
224 We have reviewed the relevant affidavit evidence and those parts of the
transcript of the oral evidence to which we have been
directed in submissions.
We have reviewed the relevant paragraphs of the appellants’ closing
submissions at trial and their
reply submissions to which our attention was
directed by paragraph 98 of the appellants’ Outline of Submissions. We
course had regard to the written and oral submissions of the parties on
the appeal with respect to this complaint.
225 We accept, without unnecessary repetition of them, the force of the
submissions of each of the wife and the third respondent in
addressing this
complaint, the effect of which is that the findings made by the
primary judge were well open.
226 We are not persuaded of any error attending the
primary judge’s finding that the DODT was not referred to at the
on 19 December 2006. We are comfortably satisfied that, on a review of
all of the evidence, that finding was well open to the primary
the 2018 reasons demonstrate that no error attended that conclusion. We
find no substance in this ground.
Ground 12: Erroneous finding as to the meeting on 9 January
18. In circumstances where Mr Jess Snr
steadfastly maintained throughout his
cross-examination that
the “game plan” was presented to him on 27 March 2007 and that was
the first day he saw the DODT,
the primary judge:
(a) erred in finding, without any evidentiary foundation;
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
that “if Mr CC’s evidence is accepted about the 9 January
2007 meeting, it goes little further than simply establishing
that by this point
in time, Mr Jess Jnr,
Mr Ban and the husband were in cahoots and
the “game plan” was on foot”
227 The first point of emphasis in addressing
this complaint, and largely determinative of it, is that the primary judge
an ultimate finding that Mr CC’s evidence was unreliable
(at [675] of the 2018 reasons).
228 Reference has already been made, in discussion of Ground 10, to the
primary judge’s adverse findings about Mr CC as a witness
[534]–[540] and [671]–[675] of the 2018 reasons). The husband
maintained that the “game plan” was first
presented to him on
27 March 2007. That contention was disputed by the appellants. It was also
rejected by the primary judge who
found that the husband was aware of the
“game plan” in January 2007 (at [73] and [610]–[613] of the
2018 reasons).
229 Acceptance of Mr CC’s evidence would not, in any event, have
substantiated the existence of the DODT prior to 2007. According
to paragraph 11
of Mr CC’s affidavit filed on 27 August 2014, as at December 2006 it
was Mr CC’s understanding, based
on his instructions from the
husband, that the units in the YUT were held mostly by the husband and, as to
the remainder, mostly
by companies under the husband’s control. Mr CC
gave evidence that this understanding was corrected by Mr Ban and the husband
9 January 2007. However, even if this evidence were accepted, it would do no
more than shift the timing of the collusion about
the “game plan”
slightly backwards. It would not be capable of tending to prove the existence of
the DODT prior to 2007.
230 There is no substance in this ground.
Ground 13: Failure to find that the evidence of Mr M was
19. The primary
judge erred
in finding that at a conference on 23 or 29 January 2007, Mr M was shown by
Mr Jess Jnr a photocopy of a handwritten
document purporting to be a Deed of
Declaration of Trust, the effect of which was to vest the Y business in Mr Jess
Jnr upon certain
milestones being achieved ([696], [697], [733] and [735]). The
finding is inconsistent with contemporaneous documents and evidence
given by Mr
M, Mr P, Mr Jess Jnr and
20. The primary judge:
(a) erred in finding; and/or
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
that although it was “conceivable” that Mr M was mistaken
“think so” ([733]). The finding is inconsistent with contemporaneous
documents and evidence given by Mr
M, Mr P, Mr Jess Jnr
231 Mr M was retained to
act for the husband in the first family law proceedings. He gave evidence
concerning several meetings or
conferences which took place in the latter part
of January 2007 or the early part of February 2007.
232 Mr M gave evidence, in summary, that in a conference he was shown a
photocopy of a handwritten document the effect of which was
to vest the X
business in Mr Jess Jnr upon certain milestones being achieved.
Mr M’s evidence was that he was told that the
handwriting appearing
on the document was that of Mr Ban and Mr M did not become aware of the
233 At [698]–[702] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge
recorded the following in relation to the evidence given by Mr M:
698. In the witness box Mr M confirmed that he
specifically recalled being shown a copy of a handwritten
Mr M stated that in the course of one of
the lengthier meetings he had with the husband, Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban and the
lawyers from
[Mr Jess Jnr] produced a document under the topic of, “Well, what if there
was a trust and dad held these things on trust for
me?” And he personally
produced the document – the handwritten document.
699. Mr M was able to recall specific details of the meeting in which he
was handed the copy of the handwritten document. He detailed
the seating
positions of all the participants at the meeting at the time the copy of the
handwritten document was handed to him
HER HONOUR: So [TT] Chambers – [TT]?---[TT] Chambers. [Mr P] was
standing to my right because he wasn’t seated and [Mr
was in the right chesterfield. [Ms Q] was on the left chesterfield making
notes. [Mr Jess Jnr] had been seated on that
same chesterfield alongside
[Ms Q] and [Mr Ban] was sitting in an occasional chair just off to the
left. And [Mr Jess Jnr] stood
up and produced a document, and I’m pretty
sure it was a plastic sleeve like that, and said under the heading of
if there was some document whereby dad held these things on trust
for me,” and then explained certain triggering events.
Is the “what if” articulated in writing or is that what he says?
That’s what he said, “What if” –
I was shown the
document. I then said, “Whose handwriting is this?” And I was told
it was [Mr Ban’s] and then I
turned around and made a comment ..... to
[Mr P] and you’re aware of that comment.
MR WALLER: I see.
HER HONOUR: Which was? “This doesn’t pass the sniff test.”
700. In Mr M words he “could not come to grips” with who owned
the company. It was his evidence that he had difficulty
understanding what the
husband’s beneficial interests were and what his income
He recalled a reference to the husband living off
a loan account
701. Mr M was consistent in his evidence about the way in which the DODT
was presented to him he stated
It wasn’t a fait accompli that this does exist. “What if it did
exist” was how it was put to me.
702. He was steadfast in his recollection stating
[...] there are some cases you recall, they stand out as beacons in your
professional career. This is one of those cases. That’s
why I remember
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnotes
234 Mr M underwent cross-examination for something in excess of four
hours. With the advantage of having seen and heard Mr M give
evidence the
primary judge recorded a discussion of, and findings about, that evidence
in some extensive detail, as appears at
[694]–[735] of the 2018
235 As already noted the primary judge found that Mr M gave
“consistent” evidence about the way in which the DODT was
to him (at [701] of the 2018 reasons) and that he was “steadfast in his
recollection” (at [702] of the 2018
reasons). The primary judge
specifically dealt with a submission to the effect that Mr M’s
recollection was “poor”
at [712] of the 2018 reasons in the
following terms:
712. I do not accept the represented third
submission that Mr M recollection was
‘poor’. I consider that he was clear in his recollection which was
shown when he
remembered the seating plan of the meeting. I do note the
represented third parties’ submission that the passage of time can
that an otherwise honest witness may make a genuine
I do not consider that by failing to look at
s evidence was of any less probative value.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnote
236 The primary judge’s detailed discussion concerning the
evidence of Mr M and the challenges mounted to that evidence concludes
the assessment that Mr M was truthful and gave evidence of his genuine
recollection (at [735] of the 2018 reasons).
237 Notably the primary judge referred to her finding that
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were unreliable witnesses as compared to
the primary judge found to be truthful (at [733] of the 2018
238 The challenges mounted on appeal to Mr M’s evidence appear to
mirror the challenges that were addressed to the primary judge
her Honour specifically dealt with in the detailed discussion to which we
have referred.
239 The contention by the appellants that the recollection of Mr M was
“poor” is contrary not only to the findings made
primary judge having seen and heard Mr M give evidence over an
extended period, but is contrary to Mr M’s own evidence.
For example,
review of the transcript confirms that Mr M gave sworn evidence that he
(a) A “clear recollection of events”
(Transcript 5 September 2016, p.297 line 3);
(b) A “clear recollection of how this document came [to his]
attention” (Transcript 5 September 2016, p.302 lines 21–22);
(c) A “clear recollection of seeing a handwritten trust deed”
(Transcript 5 September 2016, p.330 lines
240 As noted by the primary judge Mr M’s recall was
sufficiently clear that he could describe in some detail the seating position
the persons in attendance at the meeting within his chambers.
241 It is notable that when it was put to Mr M in cross-examination that
he was mistaken, Mr M responded “there are some cases
you recall,
they stand out as beacons in your professional career. This is one of those
cases. That’s why I remember it”
(Transcript 5 September 2016, p.357
lines 21–22). The primary judge recorded that at [702] of the 2018
reasons quoted above.
242 Mr N is the barrister who was retained as junior counsel for the
husband in the first family law proceedings and also gave evidence.
appellants seek to rely upon Mr N’s concession in evidence that he
(Mr N) may have conflated the DODT with the Dear Dadda
letter as some
basis for mounting a challenge to the evidence of Mr M. That is rejected
for two main reasons. First, and obviously,
Mr N’s concession only
goes to Mr N’s memory of events which is obviously a separate and
distinct issue from the assessment
of Mr M’s evidence. Second, and
perhaps more fundamentally, the evidence establishes that Mr N was not even
in attendance at
the relevant meeting where Mr M was handed the handwritten
document, and about which he gave the evidence referred to.
243 Aside from the evidence of Mr N, the appellants seek to impugn the
evidence of Mr M by reference to the evidence of each of the
instructing
solicitors, Mr P and Ms Q. However, review of their evidence does not
demonstrate inconsistency between the respective
versions. Taken from the
affidavit evidence of each of Mr P and Ms Q, they each gave evidence
to the effect that there had not been
(a) Statement of ownership that contradicted the
substance of earlier instructions of 19 December 2006;
(b) Statement or assertion that Mr Jess Jnr held or was entitled to
any part of XC;
(c) Statement or assertion that the husband had executed the DODT in 2002 or at
any other time; or
(d) Statement or assertion that a vesting condition or trigger of $10 million or
any other figure had been reached at the end of
the 2006 financial year or any
other time.
(Affidavit of Mr P filed on 10 August 2016, paragraph 46; Affidavit of
Ms Q filed on 10 August 2016, paragraph 20)
244 Whilst Mr M characterised the handwritten document he saw at one
point as a “deed” we do not consider that has any
substance given
his unequivocal evidence as to the nature of the handwritten document he
245 Whilst it is true that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban gave evidence
that was wholly inconsistent with the evidence of Mr M the simple
that these witnesses were not accepted by the primary judge as credible or
reliable witnesses. It was well open to the primary
judge to prefer the
evidence of Mr M and to reject that of Mr Jess Jnr and Mr
246 Having reviewed the evidence of Mr M by reference to the relevant
transcript references to which we were directed on appeal, taken
also with the
other evidence to which we have referred and the findings of the
primary judge, we are not persuaded that any findings
primary judge can be characterised as erroneous or as “glaringly
improbable” or “contrary to compelling
inferences”. Each of
the matters now agitated on appeal that challenge Mr M’s evidence
were raised before the primary
judge and dealt with by the
primary judge in the detailed discussion to which we have referred, and no
error is demonstrated.
247 We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 14: Alternative error relating to the evidence of Mr
21. In the alternative, if the
primary judge was correct to accept the evidence of Mr M, her Honour erred
(a) failing to find, as a “logical proposition”, that if the
handwritten document was shown to Mr M, the DODT “did
not exist at that
time” ([703]); and
(b) failing to require Ms Jess to prove to the requisite standard that
the DODT was brought into existence in a hurry between 23
or 29 January and
30 January 2007 ([53] and [387]).
248 Notably, the
appellants made no submission to the primary judge at trial to the effect
that the logical consequence of Mr M’s
evidence about the handwritten
document being shown to him was that the DODT did not exist at that time. That
submission was put
to the primary judge by the wife and rejected by
her Honour at [703] of the 2018 reasons in these terms:
703. The wife submitted that the copy of the handwritten
document shown to Mr M can only have been produced to him if the
document was not a genuine document or did not exist at that time.
That is not a logical proposition.
(As per the original)
249 A point of emphasis is that the wife submitted that the DODT was not a
genuine document.
250 A further point of emphasis emanating from the evidence of Mr M is
that the handwritten document was not produced to him by Mr
as reflecting any kind of finality, but rather as a speculative “what
if” scenario.
251 We do not accept that it would follow from the primary judge’s
acceptance of Mr M’s evidence, that the DODT and all
accompanying narrative from the witnesses had to be created in some hurry after
the conference with Mr M. The “what
if” nature of the inquiry
made of Mr M is equally consistent with plans concerning the DODT and the
surrounding narrative being
underway by the time of the conference.
252 We are not persuaded of any error on the part of the primary judge
in accepting the evidence of Mr M as to the existence of the
handwritten
document but not making the further findings sought by the wife.
253 There is no substance in this ground.
Ground 15: Erroneous finding as to the involvement of Mr Jess
Jnr and Mr Ban in the Family Court proceeding
22. The primary judge erred in finding,
without any evidentiary foundation, that the involvement of Mr Jess Jnr and Mr
Jess Snr’s Family Court proceeding in the late 2006 early 2007
(a) “supports the finding that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were the
drivers of creating the fraudulent DODT” ([808]); and
(b) “goes to the point that the DODT was fraudulently manufactured
at some point significantly after 2002” ([809]).
The findings are contrary to the contemporaneous documents and evidence
given by Mr Jess Jnr, Mr P and Ms Q.
23. The primary judge erred in finding, without any evidentiary
foundation, that
(a) “is likely to have drafted the Form 13 which omits reference to
the DODT and Hong Kong bank accounts” [789]; and
(b) was complicit in omitting the Hong Kong bank accounts from the draft
Form 13 [790],
such that “he was likely to have participated in broader fraud
against the wife that is the perpetration of the false DODT”
finding is contrary to the contemporaneous documents and evidence of Ms Q,
Mr Ban in relation to the preparation of the draft
254 The argument in support of this ground of
appeal appears to rest upon a misstatement of the primary judge’s
relevant finding.
255 The primary judge did not find, as is asserted by the appellants,
that the involvement of Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban in the husband’s
first family law proceedings in the late 2006 early 2007 period supports the
finding that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were the drivers
of creating the
fraudulent DODT. In fact, the primary judge observed that the fact
“that any instance where the DODT was said
to have been raised over the
late 2006 early 2007 period with the divorce lawyers was said to have occurred
in Mr Jess Jnr and Mr
Ban’s presence” supported such a
finding (at [808] of the 2018 reasons).
256 Part of the appellants’ challenge to the primary judge’s
observation is on the basis that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban were
physically present when the husband reviewed his draft Financial Statement on 31
January 2007.
257 However, the primary judge made a specific finding at [688(a)] of
the 2018 reasons that:
Ban sent the first draft Form 13 Financial Statement to Ms Q and Mr P
on at 9.03am
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original)
(Footnote omitted)
258 The primary judge addressed the topic of the involvement of
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban with the husband’s solicitors in the
first family law proceedings in considerable detail commencing at [795] of the
2018 reasons.
259 Within that discussion the primary judge addresses in some detail
the evidence supporting the finding made that both Mr Ban and
Mr Jess Jnr were “deeply involved” in the husband’s
first family law proceedings beyond merely providing financial
information and
being present at conferences.
260 We are not persuaded of any error in the primary judge’s
findings to the effect that Mr Ban was likely to have drafted the
Financial Statement which omitted reference to the DODT and the Hong Kong
bank accounts held by the husband and that Mr Ban
was complicit in the
omission of the Hong Kong bank accounts. We accept that these findings
were open to the primary judge given:
(a) Mr Ban’s own evidence that he was aware of the
existence of the Hong Kong bank accounts (Transcript 10 July 2017,
lines 36–37);
(b) An email from Mr Ban to Ms Q attaching the draft
Financial Statement stating “[p]lease find enclosed a draft copy of
financial statement I completed with [Mr Jess Snr] for us to
discuss and finalise” (Transcript 10 July 2017, p.734 lines 25–26;
at [773] of the 2018 reasons);
(c) Mr Ban’s evidence that “of course” he would have been
telling the truth when he wrote the email (Transcript
10 July 2017, p.735 lines
10–11; p.742 lines 14–21);
(d) Mr Ban’s admission that he prepared a draft Financial Statement for
the husband (Transcript 10 July 2017, p.742 lines 14–16);
(e) Mr Ban’s evidence as to whether he sent the draft Form 13 that omitted
the Hong Kong bank accounts, and notably his failure
(Transcript 10 July 2017, p.736 lines 42–47; p.738 lines 19–22;
p.741 lines 5–29);
(f) Mr Ban’s admission that he knew the husband was within days going to
be swearing to the truth of a document or a series
of documents (Transcript 10
July 2017, p.741 lines 39–40); and
(g) Mr Ban’s evidence that it was not his place to disclose the
Hong Kong bank accounts or to prompt the husband to do so (Transcript
10 July 2017, p.742 lines 26–30; p.743 lines
261 On any fair reading of the 2018 reasons, the primary judge did not
find or assume that Mr Ban drafted the Form 13 Financial Statement
alone. The fact that the evidence established that Mr Ban drafted the document
together with the husband does not detract from the
primary judge’s
findings to the effect that Mr Ban drafted it and that he was complicit in the
absence within that document
of any references to the husband’s
Hong Kong bank accounts.
262 There is hardly any “misstep” in the
primary judge’s conclusion that complicity in hiding “[m]ore
millions” (Transcript 10 July 2017, p.742 line 38) represented in
funds held in bank accounts which went undisclosed supports
the argument that Mr
Ban was likely to have participated in a broader fraud against the wife in the
form of the preparation of the
false DODT.
263 It was not necessary for the primary judge, in reaching her ultimate
conclusion as to the DODT, to find that Mr Ban and Mr Jess
opposed to the husband, were the drivers of the false DODT.
264 When the 2018 reasons are read as a whole the involvement of
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban with the husband’s solicitors in the
first family law proceedings in the critical period referred to was one matter
taken into account by the primary judge amongst many
factors driving the
ultimate conclusion the primary judge reached.
265 We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 16: Erroneous finding in relation to drawings from Mr
Jess Snr’s loan account
24. The primary judge erred in finding,
without any evidentiary foundation, that the payments of $540,244.86 and
$355,000 from Mr
Jess Snr’s loan account to
Jnr in the financial year 2006/2007 “were
contrary to the terms of the DODT” because there was “no evidence
Mr Jess Jnr consented to the additional drawings” and drawing these
significant amounts “could potentially impacted [sic]
the cash flow of
XC” [455]. The finding is contrary to the contemporaneous documents and
evidence of Mr Jess Jnr.
266 The trial was conducted by
all parties on the basis that the terms of the DODT precluded the husband from
drawing more than $840,000
per financial year from his loan account from the
date upon which the DODT was said to have been executed. That foundation was
by the primary judge (at [448] of the 2018 reasons).
267 On appeal, the appellants submit for the first time that drawings from
the husband’s loan account were not contrary to the
DODT on the basis that
the restrictions contained in clause 7 of the DODT did not take effect until the
“transfer of all holdings
or interests to [Mr Jess Jnr]”.
The appellants contend that such transfer, within the meaning of clause 7,
did not occur until
settlement of the trust proceedings and the first family law
proceedings on 20 September 2009 (appellants’ Outline of Submissions
filed on 24 August 2020, paragraph 147.3).
268 Clause 7 of the DODT provides as follows:
7. [Mr Jess Jnr] ACKNOWLEDGES and AGREES
[Mr Jess Snr] will be entitled to continue drawing funds from what is
commonly known as his
Loan Account until it is fully repaid to
[Mr Jess Snr]. This Loan Account is money owed to
[Mr Jess Snr] from [Y Business] and will
remain owing on completion of
this DECLARATION OF TRUST. On completion of the transfer of all holdings or
interests to [Mr Jess Jnr],
[Mr Jess Snr] agrees to not
drawn in excess of $840,000 per financial year from the Loan Account.
Additional drawings must be mutually agreed to between [Mr Jess Snr]
and [Mr Jess Jnr]. These funds may be transferred to nominated
including [Mr Jess Snr], [Ms Jess], [Ms E Jess],
[Mr F Jess], Ms G Jess] [Mr H Jess],
[Ms D Jess] and [Mr Jess Jnr] and/or
other, people,
entities, trusts and/or companies as may be agreed. No drawings may be withdrawn
if it creates adverse financial effect
on [Y Business] cash flow or banking
relationships as to be determined by the Board of [Y Business].

269 The wife contends, and we accept, that the appellants ought not be
permitted to rely on an argument raised for the first time
on appeal, for the
following reasons:
(a) Proceedings are confined within the parameters
defined by the parties at trial both as to the facts and as to the general
of the proceedings. The appellants ought be bound by the manner in which
they conducted their case at trial (
(b) It is well established that it is not open to an appellant to raise on
appeal a point which was not taken at trial if, had it
been taken, might have
been met by the calling of evidence or by some amendment or variation of the
pleadings (

270 We accept that had this point been taken at trial the wife’s case
would have been conducted differently, including but not
limited to, by way of
the production of evidence and/or submissions directed to the inconsistency
between the history of the husband’s
conduct in relation to his drawings
from the loan account and the suggestion that he would, in 2002, unilaterally
have bound himself
to limits to commence at some unspecified future date. We
accept that the wife was denied the opportunity to present her case in
manner at trial by the appellants’ failure to raise this point and as
such, we accept that the point ought not be permitted
to be taken for the first
time on appeal.
271 We also accept it to be well established that an appellant cannot succeed
on appeal in reliance on an error of fact which was
induced, or acquiesced in,
by the appellant (
Sikorski & Sikorski
[2008] FamCAFC 145
(2008) FLC 93-381).
272 This aspect aside, we doubt that any error of fact on the part of the
primary judge in this respect can be treated as material
De Winter and
(1979) FLC 90-605).
At [449] to [456] of the 2018 reasons the
primary judge set out a series of findings considered in the context of
conduct engaged
in by the husband that was apparently inconsistent with the
existence of the DODT or of the DODT having been executed on 28 February
Those findings are as follows:
449. Clause 7 and the husband’s actions in respect
to the loan account point against the DODT having been executed on 28 February
2002 for several reasons.
450. First, I do not consider that the husband would have imposed a $70,000 a
month and $840,000 a year restriction on himself as
set out by the terms of
DODT. The P Lawyers folder includes a letter drafted by the husband and
sent to his lawyers her wrote
During the period of ANZ bank concerns in 2000 and beyond and then later with
the NAB bank, I was limited to drawing a maximum amount
of $70,000 per month or
$840,000 per annum, so as to not affect the X group cash flow.
451. Mr Jess Jnr stated that he believed the National Australia Bank
(NAB) had put restrictions on the husband’s loan account
similar to that
of the ANZ Bank
Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence that the restriction was imposed by the
banks to “try and stop the cash flow impact on
the [retail] business
because it had impacted it in the past
Mr Jess Jnr understood that the agreements with ANZ and NAB both
allowed the husband to draw over $70,000 a month and over $840,000
a year if the
money was distributed to certain other people
452. It was continuously argued by the represented third parties that no one
could control how the husband spent his money. He appeared
distinction between the money of the company and his own money. In the witness
box the husband agreed that he would use
the XC money for personal
expenditure
he stated “Are you- are you
questioning what I do with my money, are
Why then, would
Mr Jess Snr have agreed in writing in the DODT to the restriction on
his drawings from the loan account? There was
no evidence by the represented
third parties that this term was negotiated by Mr Jess Jnr, generally
the evidence of the represented
third parties is that the husband unilaterally
designed the terms of the DODT based of
the 1995 Deed of Trust. The 1995
Deed of Trust does not include any such clause like clause 7 of the DODT. In
cross examination,
Mr Jess Jnr was unable to give any examples of the
husband imposing financial restrictions on himself beyond those imposed by third
parties. Given it is the represented third parties’ argument that the
husband, nor Mr Ban or Mr Jess Jnr sought any legal or
advice when preparing the DODT, it is unclear why the husband have insisted on
including the bank’s restrictions
in the DODT. However, if the DODT was
entered into in 2006/7 as the wife contends, the first Family Court proceedings
were on foot
and it was arguably in the husband’s interests to limit his
access to funds to curtail his capacity to support the wife periodically
fund a final alteration of property interests The wife and husband submitted
that it was part of the ‘game-plan’
to make the husband look like he
had no, or very little, money.
453. Second, even if I was to accept that the husband agreed to the restriction,
the husband performed a number of actions which
were contrary to clause 7, by
withdrawing over $70,000 a month and distributing it to other parties with no
clear consent or agreement
by Mr Jess Jnr. In 2005 and 2006, the
husband drew significantly more than $70,000 per month. Mr Jess Jnr
was one, but not the only
recipient of these over drawings. The wife submitted
that the husband gave approximately $2 Million to Mr Jess Jnr from the
account between the purported date of execution and early
Ms LL, who was Mr Jess Jnr’s
personal accountant during the period, stated she recalled that between 2002 and
2006 the husband
gave money to
Mr Jess Jnr
454. In the financial year 2006/2007 the husband paid Mr Jess Jnr
$895,000 from the loan account. This amount was made up of two
transactions, the
payment of $540,244.86 a gift to enable Mr Jess Jnr to acquire a Y
business in Suburb UU (a gift which the husband
later disputed and for which he
unsuccessfully sued Mr Jess Jnr) and $355,000 to buy a Mercedes Benz
In respect to the Suburb UU business, it was
Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence the money was gifted to him
by the husband and that it would be owned by a trust over which
Mr Jess Jnr obtained the benefit. In relation to the car it was
Jess Jnr’s evidence that it was a part of a “two cars
for the price of one” deal
Mr Jess Jnr
stated that he did not ask the husband for the car and he did not drive it very
455. The timing of the 2006/2007 payments to Mr Jess Jnr are
significant because, if the DODT was executed on the date it bears,
the husband
had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Mr Jess Jnr for his
personal benefit in the period just preceding and following
the husband handing
over the ownership of the company to Mr Jess Jnr. These transactions
were contrary to the terms of the DODT.
Notably, there is no evidence that
Mr Jess Jnr consented to the additional drawings. Second, it was
adverse to Mr Jess Jnr’s
interests when he would take over the
business and face the husband drawing significant amounts that could potentially
impacted the
cash flow of XC. When asked why his father would give him this
money at the same time as handing over the business, Mr Jess Jnr
with “Well, it’s [Mr Jess Snr’s]
prerogative as to what he commits to me
456. The wife also queried that had the DODT been in existence when the husband
was withdrawing more than he was permitted to,
Mr Jess Jnr not seek to insist on performance of obligations
imposed by it. The represented third parties submitted that the wife’s
suggestion that Mr Jess Jnr could prevent the husband from using the
loan account was “extraordinary” as the husband
made it clear that
he would use the XC money for his own expenditure. It was a consistent theme
throughout the represented third
case that the husband
could not be controlled. However, again a contradiction arises in the
represented third parties case, if the
husband could not be controlled why would
he have agreed to the DODT in the first place and why then in 2002 would he have
that the units in YUT had vested in Mr Jess Jnr.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnotes
273 The primary point of emphasis is that addressed by the
primary judge, namely, the question as to why the husband would have given
away nearly $900,000 of his loan account when if the DODT did exist he would be
handing over the business and his remaining loan
account was all that he
274 We are not persuaded that the appellants ought be permitted to raise this
argument for the first time on appeal. In any event
we are not persuaded that
any error of the kind contended for is material in all the circumstances.
275 This ground of appeal is rejected.
Ground 17: Erroneous finding as to distribution of the $6
25. The primary judge erred in finding,
without any evidentiary foundation, that the distribution of $6 million in 2006
further element of the perfect storm...that was carefully
orchestrated to place Mr Jess Jnr as the sole unit holder of the YUT in
2006” ([442]). The finding is contrary to the contemporaneous documents
and evidence of Mr Jess Jnr
276 Commencing
at [433] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge deals with the topic of
“[c]ontrol of the [t]rustee” and
distributions made having the
effect of the “trigger” point being reached for the purpose of
clause 6 of the DODT. At
[433] the primary judge records:
433. In cross examination, it emerged that Mr Ban and
Mr Jess Jnr were two of the three directors of the trustee, III Pty
Ltd, between
After December 2004, the new trustee of YUT was X Pty Ltd. For context,
replicate what the wife explained in her closing submissions about the role that
the Trustee plays which was not disputed by the
represented third parties. The
reference to the ‘Trust’ is what I have referred to as
‘YUT’ and Corporation
as ‘XC’. It was
The Corporation pays an annual Licence fee to the Trust, the quantum of which is
dependent on turnover levels. The Trust (being discretionary
as to income) can
then elect to distribute the Trust’s year end profit to any eligible
beneficiary. The Corporation was one
such beneficiary and always received some
level of distribution. It is for this reason that the “[Retail]
business” in
reality comprises the Corporation and the Trust combined.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnotes
277 Importantly at [439] and [440] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge
recorded this:
439. Dealing first with the first submission of the
wife, in the witness box Mr Jess Jnr agreed that the EBIT was reached
of the distribution and that the distribution had occurred, despite
absence of directors meeting minute. The transcript
And you haven’t been able to produce any resolution, signed or otherwise,
for the trust for 30 June 2006, have you? Sorry,
for the trustee of the trust,
for 30 June 2006?---No.
Does that date, [Mr Jess Jnr], strike you as an important one?---Well,
not specifically the date, no.
Isn’t your case that the year ending 30 June 2006, when the earnings of
the corporation, before interest and tax, passed the
magic $10 million
figure?---Yes.
And do you agree with me that that was only achieved by including as part of the
corporations income a significant distribution back
from the trust?---Yes.
Yes. And yet you are unable to produce the minute whereby that significant
distribution from the trust was made back to the corporation?---Yes,
fact is that it was made back to the corporation.
440. Mr Jess Jnr admitting that the EBIT was reached because of the
distribution was contrary to the submission of the represented
that Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence revealed that the $10 Million
EBIT was reached by reason of the significant increase in XC’s
revenue, rather than by trust distribution. However, the transcript clearly
reflects that Mr Jess Jnr said it was a combination
distribution and increase in sales
So how were you able to meet the EBIT target of $10 million during 2006?---Well,
by improving the sales.
HER HONOUR: And giving some trust distribution?---Yes, which also meant trying
to stem the losses of other businesses, your Honour.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnotes
278 The primary judge specifically dealt with a submission of the
appellants that annual trust distributions from the YUT were first
companies within the group which had sustained losses during that financial year
and only then was the balance distributed
to XC (at [441] of the 2018
279 As to this the primary judge found at [442] of the 2018 reasons:
442. Whether or not a distribution could have been made
to Calder Park is not as significant as the fact that the distributions was
the discretion of the trustees. It is undisputed that in 2006 $6 Million was
distributed and the trigger was thereby reached.
This is a further element of
the perfect storm that I find that was carefully orchestrated to place
Mr Jess Jnr as the sole unit
holder of the YUT in 2006.
(As per the original)
280 Contrary to paragraph 149 of the appellants’ Outline of
Submissions, the primary judge did not erroneously find that the
target was achievable before 2006 by way of a trust distribution. There is no
such finding in the primary judge’s 2018
reasons. None of the
findings reached by the primary judge are inconsistent with the
281 We are not persuaded of any merit in this ground.
Ground 18: Erroneous finding as to the Mr QQ settlement
26. The primary
judge erred in
finding, without any evidentiary foundation, that “the likely
explanation” for Mr Jess Jnr’s responses
in relation to the
Mr QQ settlement was “that the DODT had not been executed and he had
no contingent or other entitlement
in the units transacted by the husband”
([328]). The finding is contrary to the evidence of Mr Jess
282 The relevance of “the Mr QQ
settlement” is set out at [322] of the 2018 reasons in the following
322. In November 2002, the husband settled the dispute
with Mr Mr QQ regarding the 1995 Deed of Trust. The settlement involved the
transfer of units in the YUT back to VVV Pty Ltd, a company of which the husband
was sole shareholder, director and company secretary,
and not to the husband
personally. The wife submitted that if the DODT was executed on 28 February
2002, then the Mr QQ Settlement
was inconsistent with the DODT as the terms
of the DODT were such that the husband could not deal with the units without
Jnr’s consent as he held the units on trust for
Mr Jess Jnr at all times from 2002.
283 There is no apparent error in the primary judge’s ultimate
finding recorded at [328] of the 2018 reasons in these terms:
328. Mr Jess Jnr seemed uncharacteristically
unprepared for this line of questioning and I find that his evidence was
unconvincing.
His responses point to his entitlement under the DODT not being a
consideration for him as at November 2002 and the likely explanation
that is that the DODT had not been executed and he had no contingent or other
entitlement in the units transacted by the husband.
284 That finding is put into context by the earlier findings at
[323]–[327] of the 2018 reasons as follows:
323. It was Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence that
he “could not remember what the discussions were back
in relation to the Mr QQ
Settlement. Yet, it was Mr Jess Jnr’s earlier evidence that he
had carefully read the DODT a number
of times when the husband had given it to
him in February 2002. The terms of the DODT would likely have been fresh in
Mr Jess Jnr’s
mind at the time of the Mr QQ Settlement as
the settlement occurred only eight months after the DODT was allegedly
324. Even with Mr Jess Jnr’s apparent lack of understanding of
beneficial and legal interest, it is clear that the husband
was restricted in
the way he could deal with the units under the terms of the DODT, even before
the Target was reached. The provision
in the DODT about the husband requiring
Mr Jess Jnr’s consent to deal with units was unambiguous. In the
witness box, Mr Jess
Jnr agreed the husband understood that he was
restricted in how he could deal with the units, but Mr Jess Jnr was
unconcerned that
the husband was transferring the units to a legal entity other
than himself
Mr Jess Jnr could not remember
any discussions that he had with the husband about transferring the units to VVV
325. The represented third parties submitted that it was immaterial that the
units were transferred to VVV Pty Ltd, as opposed to
the husband personally as
at the time of the transfer the husband was the sole shareholder, director and
company secretary of VVV
Pty Ltd and, accordingly, if the Target was reached,
Mr Jess Jnr could require the husband to transfer the units from VVV
to him. Lastly, the represented third parties submitted that the husband
did not draw a distinction between himself and VVV Pty Ltd,
“Well, if – either way, VVV Pty Limited was
326. When asked if Mr Jess Jnr considered asking the husband how the
Mr QQ Settlement was to his benefit, in accordance with the
terms of the
DODT, Mr Jess Jnr responded:-
“Well, the benefit was, I guess, he got them back from [Mr QQ], which
is not – you know, I had no control over [Mr QQ]”.
327. Mr Jess Jnr did not recall if he had asked, and what the benefit
would be to him
The use of phrase “I
guess”, above, does not impress me as something someone would say who had,
in the past, expressly
consented to the Mr QQ Settlement and the transfer
of the units to VVV Pty Ltd.
(Tracked changes in original) (Footnotes omitted)
285 The submission of the appellants that the husband had not acted contrary
to the terms of the DODT by having units returned as
a result of the Mr QQ
settlement transferred to VVV Pty Ltd ignores clause 1 of the DODT. That
clause provided that the husband confirmed
that as of 28 February 2002
“his Entire Holdings that is the Existing Units are held and all Future
Units will be held in the
Unit Trust for [Mr Jess Jnr]”. It is
clear from the terms of the DODT that the units transferred as a result of the
Mr QQ settlement
fell within the restraint purportedly provided for in the
286 Clause 2 of the DODT expressly provided that any dealings by the husband
with units or interests held as trustee were to be for
the benefit of
Mr Jess Jnr and not for the husband’s own benefit.
287 Under the terms of the DODT Mr Jess Jnr was required to take
the positive step of consenting to any dealing with the units.
Jess Jnr was unable to provide an explanation for the units being
transferred by Mr QQ to VVV Pty Ltd rather than to the husband.
288 At no stage of his evidence did Mr Jess Jnr give evidence to
the effect that he had consented to the transaction nor did he appear
considered its propriety.
289 The argument that the primary judge ought not to have found that the
husband’s actions in relation to the Mr QQ settlement
were contrary
to the DODT on the basis of Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence that he
believed that until he had reached the target the
DODT did nothing for him, is
rejected. That answer was given in the context of a line of questioning about a
different issue, being
whether Mr Jess Jnr had obtained legal advice
judge noted, even without an understanding of the distinction
between legal and equitable ownership, had the DODT been genuine, it
been plain to Mr Jess Jnr, whose evidence was that he had read the
DODT carefully, that the DODT on its face restrained
the husband’s
dealings with units in the YUT (at [324] of the 2018 reasons).
290 The primary judge explained in the 2018 reasons her findings as to
inconsistency between the terms of the Mr QQ settlement and
the existence
of the DODT. We find no error in any of the findings expressed by the
primary judge in reaching that conclusion.
291 There is no merit in this ground.
Ground 19: Erroneous finding as to the 4 September 2006
27. The primary judge erred:
(a) in finding, without any evidentiary foundation; and/or
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
(i) the 4 September 2006 documents “were invented to facilitate a
false trail of evidence to corroborate the existence of the
DODT prior to
19 December 2006” [(560)];
(ii) “the 4 September documents were created to undermine the
wife’s case” ([570]); and
(iii) “the only plausible explanation of the creation of the
documents is that the documents were created by someone who wished
to prove that
the DODT was executed on the date it bears” ([579]).
Taking into account all of the relevant evidence, the primary judge
ought to have found that at least one other plausible explanation
Mr KK prepared the documents and Mr Jess Snr signed them on 4 September
28. The primary judge erred:
(a) in finding, without any evidentiary foundation; and/or
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
that “even if the husband’s signatures were genuine, the 4
September documents could still have been created by or at
the direction of the
husband assisted by Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban for the fraudulent
purposes.” [547]. The finding is inconsistent
with other findings of the
primary judge and the evidence of Mr Jess Snr.
29. The primary judge erred in finding that “the represented
third parties stopped short of contending” that Mr Jess Snr
executed the 4
September 2006 documents on that day ([548]). The finding fails to take into
account paragraph 131 of the represented
third parties’ closing
submissions and paragraph 168 of the represented third parties’ reply
submissions.
292 We have already, in addressing Ground 2
of this appeal, dealt at some length with the 4 September 2006 documents
and the primary
judge’s discussion of that topic from
[526]–[579] of the 2018 reasons occupying some 15 pages and 97
footnotes. We need not repeat that discussion here but obviously
it is relevant
to the disposition of this ground.
293 There was no dispute before the primary judge that the three
documents comprising the 4 September 2006 documents are false documents.
already noted there was no dispute that the letters forming part of the 4
September 2006 documents were never sent and the purported
minutes of a
directors meeting purport to record a meeting that was never held or even
294 In addition to what we have already discussed in addressing Ground 2, we
need only add several matters.
295 First, in circumstances where there was no issue that the
4 September 2006 documents are false documents, the context in which
primary judge undertook her consideration of the issue and discussion is
set out at [530] of the 2018 reasons in the following
530. The circumstances surrounding the creation,
location, and production of the 4 September 2006 documents are unusual and
of a person or group of persons having the motivation and capacity to
create false documentation in the same broad time frame in
which the wife
asserts that the DODT was manufactured. The wife’s case is that the 4
September documents were created in 2008
by Mr Ban and Mr Jess Jnr for
the Trust Proceedings. In particular, that Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban had
created the documents using a
precedent of two other documents; minutes from a
1998 directors meeting (“the 1998 minutes”) and a letter sent after
the 1998 directors meeting (“the 1998 letter”).
Mr Jess Jnr then placed them in the back room of the XC offices and
Mr CC (who was acting for XC in the Trust Proceedings) to search
the back room for documents. The wife contends that Mr Jess Jnr
sure that Mr CC would find the documents, which he did.
Mr Jess Jnr and Mr Ban deny any such involvement.
(As per the original)
296 On the question of whether or not the husband signed the 4 September 2006
documents the primary judge addressed that specific
topic commencing at
[541] of the 2018 reasons noting that the issue at trial “turns out only
to credit”.
297 In that context the primary judge rejected the evidence of the
husband and the wife about them not being able to be at the XC
offices on 4
September 2006 as well as not actually being there (at [545] of the 2018
298 In dealing with the evidence of the handwriting experts the
primary judge recorded at [546] of the 2018 reasons:
546. The evidence of the handwriting experts,
Mr OO, the represented third parties
expert, and Mr PP,
the wife’s expert was relevant to whether the husband had signed the
documents. In a joint memorandum, the
handwriting experts found that the
signatures on the 4 September 2006 documents are consistent with the
husband’s signature
However, the experts could
not exclude the possibility that that the signatures were scanned onto the
Mr PP found there was insufficient
evidence to establish when the signatures were created
Ultimately the evidence of the handwriting experts pointed to the fact it was
the husband’s signature on the 4 September 2006
document, however their
evidence did not support a conclusion either way that the husband in fact signed
the document and when he
(Tracked changes in original) (Footnotes omitted)
299 The primary judge recorded a finding that it was possible for the
husband to have attended the offices of XC on 4 September 2006
and that he may
have been physically capable of signing the 4 September 2006 documents (at [547]
of the 2018 reasons).
300 The primary judge noted the denial each of Mr Jess Jnr and
Mr Ban of being involved in the “manufacture of the 4 September
documents” (at [548] of the 2018 reasons).
301 Commencing at [549] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge addressed
the topic of “[t]he unearthing of the 4 September documents”
with the involvement of Mr CC, a witness whose evidence the
primary judge did not accept for the reasons she explained.
302 At [560] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge expressed acceptance
of a submission of the wife that the late production in the
trust proceedings of
the 4 September 2006 documents “came with an odour of recent invention and
manufacture”. At [561]
and following of the 2018 reasons the
primary judge undertook detailed consideration of the provenance of the 4
September 2006 documents.
It was in that context that the primary judge
discussed the evidence concerning the involvement of Mr Jess Jnr with
Mr KK referred
to in this ground. At [563] of the 2018 reasons the
primary judge recorded:
563. In regards to the search for the originals,
Mr Jess Jnr repeated that he could not remember, but he would have
done what he was
required to do
Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence that he was not overly concerned with the
origin of the documents, under cross examination by
Mr Dickson he
I obviously tried to find the origins of the document. So at the time, if I
thought there was other people to speak to, then, yes,
I would have asked
Like who? Who are the sorts of people you would have asked?---Well,
[Mr Jess Snr] would be the primary one.
Yes?---[Mr KK] would have been another, but he was not on – you know,
he’s not on my side then. I think by then he might
have been working for
[Ms Jess]. I can’t remember.
Did you ring him?---[Mr KK] and I didn’t sort of leave on good terms
– or he didn’t leave on good terms so, no,
I didn’t. I believe
I might have actually tried to contact him, but I don’t think he called me
Right. Okay. What about your lawyers? Did you contact any lawyers, find out
whether they had anything to do with these documents?---Not
that I can think of.
But I may have, but I just can’t think of it.
A lot of may haves, [Mr Jess Jnr]. You really can’t recall any
of this; is that right?---They’re not my documents, so
(Tracked changes in original) (Footnotes omitted)
303 It is clear on the evidence and the primary judge’s discussion
of this evidence that the possibility that the husband had
caused Mr KK to
create these false documents was not asserted by Mr Jess Jnr. Rather,
Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence extended only
to the feature that
Mr KK might have been a person he asked about the documents.
304 None of Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban or Mr CC made reference in
their affidavits to seeking information from Mr KK. However, in
cross-examination
Mr CC said:
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Okay?
[MR CC]: My recollection of these three documents was that they were a puzzle
from day 1. No one ever knew the provenance of them,
and that the generally
– general theory in our camp was that they were documents that had
possibly been drawn up by [Mr KK],
hence, the reference to [RR Lawyers]. We
made inquiries with [Mr KK] which he refused to assist. And [RR Lawyers]
make the inquiries. I think [DD Lawyers] did, but I
do recall somebody reporting back at some stage that [RR Lawyers],
find anything with respect to the three documents either.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: And - - -?
[MR CC]: So their provenance always remained unclear.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Eventually, the provenance became a real mystery;
that’s the case, isn’t it?
[MR CC]: No. It was always a mystery.
(Transcript 18 July 2017, p.1361 lines 32–44)
305 It needs to be emphasised that the primary judge did not, in her
detailed discussion of this topic, record any finding that the
husband was not
associated with the creation of the false 4 September 2006 documents. The
primary judge left open the possibility
that the husband, during the period
when he was asserting the DODT was genuine, was involved with the false 4
September 2006 documents
albeit not on 4 September 2006.
306 As is pointed out by the wife, there is an apparent contradiction for the
appellants’ position on appeal in that there is
no explanation as to why
the husband and/or Mr KK would create false documents on 4 September 2006
to corroborate a genuine DODT.
307 It is contended that the primary judge erred in finding that the
appellants stopped short of contending that the husband executed
the 4 September
2006 documents on that day (at [548] of the 2018 reasons) and that this
finding fails to take into account the appellants’
closing submissions and
reply submissions. However, that is simply not so. Neither of those paragraphs
dealt with in the submissions
of the appellants appear to contain any direct or
explicit contention. The subject submissions agitated the proposition that, as
the primary judge in fact recognised (at [548] of the 2018 reason), the
husband had the opportunity to execute the 4 September 2006
These do not mount to submissions that the primary judge make a specific
308 For these reasons, and those discussed in addressing this topic when
dealing with Ground 2, we find no substance in this ground.
Ground 20: Erroneous findings regarding the Management
30. The primary
judge erred
(a) finding that the documents annexed to the supplementary affidavit of
Mr V “did not meet the description provided in the
(b) doubting the “authenticity of the documents” annexed to
the supplementary affidavit of Mr V ([277]) and whether the
“Management accounts did in fact exist” ([285)];
(c) finding that “there was no explanation as to why Mr V was
requested to confirm a “financial report” for the
year ended 20 June
2006 [sic] when the DODT contemplated “Management Accounts” ([294]);
(d) finding that the evidence of Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban and Mr V in
relation to the Management Accounts was “an attempt to cobble
narrative well after the event” [321].
The findings have no evidentiary foundation and are contrary to the
evidence of Mr V and Mr Jess Jnr. The primary judge ought to have
found that the executive board reports annexed to the supplementary affidavit of
Mr V included the relevant Management Accounts for
the year ended 30 June
31. The primary judge erred in finding, without any evidentiary
foundation, that:
(a) it was “inconceivable that Mr Jess Jnr and/or his lawyers would
have destroyed the Management account (and any and all copies
thereof) which
demonstrated that the condition precedent to the ownership of units vesting in
him had been satisfied” ([272]);
(b) it was “difficult to imagine a more important document”
than the actual Management Accounts for the year ended 30
The findings are inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Jess Jnr and
32. The primary judge erred in:
(a) finding that Mr V’s evidence “would have carried
significantly more weight if there had been evidence to the effect
that Mr Jess
Jnr, Mr Ban or the husband had ever asked Mr V to verify or certify the
Management accounts for 30 June 2006”
[(313)]; and
(b) rejecting his evidence “that he had had a discussion with Mr
Jess Jnr in about December 2006 where Mr Jess Jnr had told
him that the DODT
existed” [(372]).
The finding is inconsistent with the evidence of
309 We have already, in dealing with Ground 2
and Ground 10 of this appeal, discussed the primary judge’s
assessment of Mr V
as a witness and his evidence relating to the topic of
Management accounts. We have thus already explained our reasoning for finding
substance in the complaints in either Ground 2 or Ground 10. That same reasoning
concerning the Management accounts applies with
the same result to the
complaints agitated in this ground concerning that topic.
310 By clause 6a of the DODT the subject interests would vest in
Mr Jess Jnr when “as determined in its Management
the Jess business derived EBIT of in excess of $10 million in
any one financial year. It follows that the importance of the “Management
accounts” is obvious, those accounts being the trigger for the operative
effect of the DODT.
311 The primary judge undertook a detailed analysis of the topic of
Management accounts over some 61 paragraphs from [260]–[321]
of the 2018
312 Importantly that discussion highlights the lack of disclosure by the
appellants as to anything meeting the description of “Management
accounts” notwithstanding orders being made for disclosure. For example,
as referred to by the primary judge at [264] of the
2018 reasons, she made
an order on 29 July 2015 “[b]y way of further and better discovery”
for the appellants to provide
to the wife copies of “Management
accounts” for relevant years.
313 It is clear that the documents provided in purported compliance with that
order did not meet the description of “Management
314 At [271] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge recorded this:
271. The wife submitted that the ‘wholesale’
failure to meet Discovery obligations in relation to the Management accounts
should cause the Court significant concern about the attitude of the represented
third parties to Disclosure. It did. It also brings
into sharp focus that, when
pressed on the 31
day of the trial, the represented third parties
could not produce the document which demonstrated that the trigger under the
had been satisfied. The condition to vesting was said by the represented
third parties to have been met in June 2006 but not verifiable
with certainty
until sometime in 2007. The represented third parties could have had no doubt
that, from early February 2007 onwards,
Mr Jess Jnr’s alleged
entitlement under the DODT was a very significant issue in the first Family Law
proceedings and the Trust
proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria and,
shortly thereafter, with the ATO.
(As per the original)
315 Given the significance of this issue to the DODT and thus to the very
issue at trial, it is unsurprising that the primary judge
focused upon, and
expressed her dissatisfaction regarding, critical documents being produced on
the evening before the last day of
an 87 day trial.
316 The point of emphasis is not whether documents ultimately produced
correctly met the description of “Management accounts”.
The point of
emphasis made repeatedly by the primary judge concerns the conduct and
evidence of the appellants around the existence
or otherwise of Management
accounts and the apparent inability to produce documents meeting that
description earlier than the belated
production of them.
317 Notably, the primary judge was troubled by the evidence given in the
appellants’ case as to the production or question of
Management accounts.
For example, at [283]–[284] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge
283. The wife submitted, and I agree, that
Mr Jess Jnr was evasive in relation to the question of the Management
accounts. The wife
submitted, and again I agree, that this evidence was
inherently unlikely given the overwhelming importance of the Management accounts
in the day-to-day conduct of the business, let alone if they had been the
trigger of the vesting of the units in Mr Jess Jnr pursuant
284. Mr Jess Jnr’s evasiveness was further demonstrated when he
was questioned about the documents shown to him by
Well, how long did you have these Management accounts in your
possession?‑‑-It depend – there is not a finite question
how long I had them for; it varies by different accounts. If you’re
talking about the end of ’06 ones - - -
Yes. I’m talking about – sorry, when I talk about the Management
accounts, I’m particularly interested, and assume
the question is directed
to, the year ended 30 June ’06 for the corporation,
right?‑‑-Yes.
For how long did you have in your hand or in your possession the [Mr KK]
generated or the accounting department generated final Management
accounts?---Well, I don’t think I said that [Mr KK] gave me final
Management accounts.
How did you get them?‑‑-Well, again, it depends when you’re
asking the question.
I’m asking you today?---No, but at what point – no, but at what
point in time are you referring to final Management accounts?
don’t think they were completed in a – in an accurate form until
well after [Mr KK] was left – had left.
HER HONOUR: So that’s October 2006?‑‑-Yes.
MR DICKSON: I thought you said earlier today that [Mr KK] produced
something, the Management accounts. You might not have been all
that happy with
how it looked, but that he produced final Management accounts. Is that not what
you said before?‑‑-No.
I said - - -
All right. So they might have been produced in the form that you thought was
more satisfactory. Did they get produced a number of
times; there were a number
of incarnations of this management account?‑‑-I don’t
specifically recollect. What I
recollect is that at a point in time I had
something in front of me that allowed me to form the opinion that it looked like

It looked like you would or it looked like you had?‑‑-The well, it
look like I had. But it didn’t say I emphatically

(Tracked changes in original) (Footnote omitted)
318 That led to the primary judge expressing the conclusion at [285] of
the 2018 reasons, open on the evidence, that:
285. The existence or non-existence of something
resembling a Management account was muddled and confusing. I find that
Mr Jess Jnr
was deliberating obfuscating. I am in doubt as to whether
Management accounts did in fact exist.
(As per the original)
319 When the reasons of the primary judge on the topic of Management
accounts are reviewed, together with the detailed references
to evidence
contained within that discussion, it is readily apparent that there was no
clarity at all from the appellants about what
“Management accounts”
constituted and whether they had been maintained or still existed over the
various periods discussed
in the 2018 reasons.
320 As the primary judge referred to at [288] and [289] of the 2018
reasons, Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence altered from “Management
accounts” to “final Management accounts”.
321 Notwithstanding the express terms of clause 6a of the DODT, the
appellants submitted to the primary judge that Mr Jess Jnr was
fact reliant upon audited accounts to confirm that the target had been met. The
primary judge, unsurprisingly, was unconvinced
322 In summary, the primary judge considered the late production, on the
eve of the last day of trial, of what appeared to be fundamentally
documents, to be entirely incongruent both with the significance of the
documents and with the manner in which the appellants
had presented their
323 It is important that it be emphasised that the primary judge did not
make an express finding or findings to the effect that the
documents annexed to
Mr V’s affidavit were fraudulent. Whilst her Honour expressed doubts
positive findings that the documents were not
324 Having reviewed the primary judge’s detailed discussion in the
2018 reasons referred to, we are not persuaded of any errors
on the part of the
primary judge in dealing with the topic of Management accounts. We are
satisfied that any factual findings made
by the primary judge had an
evidentiary foundation. The fact that any finding may be seen as contrary to the
evidence of Mr V and
Mr Jess Jnr has to be considered in the
context that neither of those witnesses were found to be reliable witnesses on
325 We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 21: Erroneous finding as to Mr FF’s hypothetical
33. The primary
judge erred
in finding, without any evidentiary foundation, that Mr Jess Jnr
considered “arguing the DODT was invalid”
([880]) and “was
prepared to contemplate tearing up the DODT to save tax” ([882]). The
finding is contrary to the evidence
of Mr Jess Jnr, Mr FF and
34. The primary judge erred in finding, without any evidentiary
foundation, that:
(a) paragraph (c) of the draft letter sent on 22 June 2010 by Mr Jess Jnr
to Mr FF was related to Mr FF’s email of 20 April
(b) there had not been a breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn
notwithstanding that “it was never put to Mr Jess Jnr that the
letter related to Mr FF’s email of 20 April 2009 detailing
Mr O’s advice regarding arguing the DODT was invalid”
326 The relevant context of this ground is that
the DODT resulted in the ATO issuing to the husband assessments for a
substantial
taxation liability. The primary judge recorded that by March
2009 the ATO was pursuing the husband for more than $50 million (at
[837] of the
2018 reasons). As also noted by the primary judge there were also
potential taxation consequences for Mr Jess Jnr consequent
DODT (at [862] of the 2018 reasons).
327 Mr FF was the taxation lawyer who acted for both
Mr Jess Jnr and the husband from early 2009 in relation to taxation
FF briefed Mr O of counsel to advise on taxation issues. As
earlier noted, Mr EE was the lawyer acting for Mr Jess Jnr in the
proceedings.
328 Whilst the primary judge’s discussion of this topic was
extensive, with some 20 pages of the 2018 reasons being devoted
[835]–[894] of the 2018 reasons) the complaint in this ground is directed
to two, essentially overlapping, findings.
329 The primary judge recorded that both the wife and the appellants
agreed that Mr EE was a truthful witness, and the primary judge
accepted his evidence in whole to the point that Mr Jess Jnr had not
instructed Mr EE to pursue or follow a course of arguing that
the DODT was
invalid (at [880] of the 2018 reasons). The primary judge recorded,
however, an acceptance that Mr Jess Jnr at least
“considered
it”, that is, arguing that the DODT was invalid (at [880] of the 2018
330 It can be seen that the finding expressed at [882] of the 2018 reasons,
also the subject of complaint, is essentially the same
finding or a
consequential finding, that is, the expression that Mr Jess Jnr was
“prepared to contemplate tearing up the DODT
simply to save
331 Mr FF’s evidence was that prior to consulting with Mr O
in 2009, Mr Jess Jnr had seen a dot point document prepared by
FF which contained the question: “[w]hat if we argue in the
alternative as part of objection that Declaration of Trust invalid?”
Clearly Mr Jess Jnr knew that Mr FF was going to seek advice from
Mr O about that topic.
332 On 20 April 2009 Mr FF sent Mr Jess Jnr an email detailing
the discussion between Mr FF and Mr O at the conference. It recorded
that the meeting “focussed on the issue of what the impact, if any, would
be on the tax dispute if the Supreme Court proceedings
were settled on the basis
of obtaining an order from the Supreme Court by consent that the Declaration of
trust was void ab initio”
(as per the original). This is recorded at [874]
of the 2018 reasons together with the primary judge’s findings
that as follows:
874. However, Mr FF stated that he believed that
Mr Jess Jnr had given him instructions for Mr FF to see
On 20 April 2009, Mr FF sent
Mr Jess Jnr, Mr CC, and Mr EE and email that
Mr FF’s meeting with Mr O. The email
As [Mr Jess Jnr] knows, I met with [Mr O] on Thursday afternoon
and ran through the background to the tax dispute and focussed on
the issue of
what the impact, if any, would be on the tax dispute if the Supreme Court
proceedings were settled on the basis of obtaining
an order from the Supreme
Court by consent that the Declaration of trust was void ab initio. [Mr O]
agreed to consider this issue
and arrangements were made to have a telephone
discussion on Friday which did go ahead.
The key points made by [Mr O] during the telephone discussion were
1. While it is a somewhat unsettled area of law, his view was that the ATO being
a third party) may not be bound by any such consent
order but nonetheless it
would have to think carefully about its position and may decide to accept the
consent order.
8. All in all [Mr O] believed that the consent order may not make the ATO
go away but if it did then the ATO could not successfully
clam this was a tactic
adopted by [Mr Jess Snr] to defeat a creditor and that it exposed him
and those involved in it to some form
9. However [Mr O] did express concerns about the possible post-CGT status
of some of [Mr Jess Snr’s] units and thought the
redirect its attention to this aspect.
This email makes it very clear that Mr FF and Mr O were exploring the
possibility of arguing that the DODT was invalid. It was not
Mr Jess Jnr if he had seen the email, but it was sent to him and I am
satisfied that he was aware of it. The wife submitted
that it was clear that
Mr Jess Jnr was promptly advised of the outcome of the conference with
Mr O given the proximity of the Mr
O’s advice to the scheduled
Trust Proceedings trial (22 April 2009).
(Tracked changes in original) (Footnotes omitted)
333 As to the latter part of that paragraph, Mr FF gave evidence that he
would have reported the outcome of the meeting to Mr Jess
the meeting (Transcript 7 September 2016, p.458 lines 34–36).
334 On 22 June 2010 Mr Jess Jnr sent an email to Mr FF in the
form of a draft letter to the husband the terms of which were recorded
primary judge at [883] and [884] of the 2018 reasons as follows:
883. On 22 June 2010, Mr Jess Jnr sent an
email to Mr FF that appeared to be a draft letter to the
The draft letter occurs at a time after the
husband was alleging to Mr FF that the DODT was a fraud.
884. The draft letter addresses a number of points about the ATO’s
assessment of the husband and that Mr Jess Jnr had a potential
corresponding liability. The letter stated:
Where does this leave us? In summery [sic]
my clear understanding from the ATO that they believe I am just as liable for
the CGT as [Mr Jess Snr] as Trustee for the Declaration
of Trust made
on 28 February 2002over units in the Y Unit Trust is. WE ARE BOTH IN THE SAME
have sound advice that say [sic] we have valid and strong grounds to for our
argument and so far the ATO has not given us any legal
rational to doubt this
alternative point is that we pretend it didn’t happen and hope it goes
does not have to accept this point and will say that it is constructive
years of Court hearings would all have been for rubbish. Would have to be
claimed to be a lie and perjury would have been committed.
could only be done in Court you against me one wins one loses. No one will win
out of that except if you win, [Ms Jess] can claim
more, you will be
disgraced, as will [Mr Ban] as I as well as all of us could go to jail. ANY
consent would be ignored by the ATO.
Doesn’t make a lot of sense just to
get out of a Tax assessment that our legal advice and we believe is grossly
The best approach is to let me work with Mr FF and
get this sorted out before something stupid happens lets deal with the facts
we have presented to the ATO and get a resolution. They have made it very
clear to me if they can’t get what they want from
you they will try to get
it from me. The most important point is our advice is weighted heavily against
their assessment. If we stay
calm and focus on the facts we should prevail as we
did in the sales tax dispute.
(Tracked changes in original) (Footnote omitted)
335 It is clear enough that there was sufficient evidentiary foundation for
the primary judge to infer that Mr Jess Jnr had at least
“considered” arguing about the validity of the DODT and that
inference was open on the email authored by Mr Jess Jnr.
336 The findings of the primary judge do not rest on any mistaken view
of the evidence given by either Mr EE or Mr FF. The primary
recorded that it was Mr FF’s evidence that he did not write the
hypothetical question (appearing in his dot point document)
because he was
instructed to do so (at [870] of the 2018 reasons). The primary judge
also recorded that it was Mr FF’s evidence
that he did not speak to
Mr EE about arguing that the DODT was invalid (at [877] of the
2018 reasons). At [878] of the 2018 reasons
the primary judge recorded
findings concerning Mr EE’s lack of engagement or involvement with
the subject issues.
337 We find no error in the primary judge determining that paragraph c)
of Mr Jess Jnr’s subject email reflected the advice
received from Mr O and recorded by Mr FF and relayed to
Mr Jess Jnr. It was an inference readily available that the advice
received from Mr O informed the content of Mr Jess Jnr’
June 2010 email to Mr FF comprising the draft proposed letter to the
338 As to the complaint concerning a breach of the rule in
, this point was squarely addressed by the primary judge at [889]
of the 2018 reasons in the following terms:
889. The represented third parties submitted that, in
breach of the rule in
Brown v Dunne
, it was never put to
Mr Jess Jnr that the draft letter related to Mr FF’s email
of 20 April 2009 detailing Mr O’s advice
regarding arguing the DODT
was invalid. Mr FF gave evidence on 7 September 2016 and 2 and 3 November
2016 during which time Mr Jess
Jnr sat in Court. Mr Jess Jnr
gave evidence from 19 to 26 June 2017. Mr Jess Jnr had more than
adequate opportunity to address issues
which arose from Mr FF’s
evidence. There is no breach of the rule in
Brown v Dunne
(As per the original)
339 The argument in support of this ground mischaracterises the actual
finding of the primary judge which was that paragraph c) of
Mr Jess Jnr’s subject email “reflects the email from
Mr FF conveying Mr O’s advice that the ATO may not accept
agreement by consent that the DODT was invalid” (at [885] of the 2018
reasons). The point is the primary judge did not determine
Mr Jess Jnr’s paragraph c) was
Mr FF’s email but rather that it reflected the advice received from
Mr O recorded in Mr FF’s earlier email.
340 The connection between Mr O’s advice and
Mr Jess Jnr’s draft letter was put to Mr Jess Jnr in
the following exchange:
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: And one of those
facts that you wanted to explain to him was that taking an alternative position,
that is, the two of you pretending the deed of declaration trust didn’t
happen, wouldn’t work, wouldn’t get out
of the tax bill.
That’s right, isn’t it?
[MR JESS JNR]: Yes, I did say if - - -
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: And you wanted to make that point with
[MR JESS JNR]: I will have to go back to it, but it says
“pretend”. I think I say “pretend it didn’t
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: And that’s because that was the
advice that you had had 15 months earlier, 14 months
earlier, from
[MR JESS JNR]: No. Logically with the ATO in the dealings I’ve
had with them, you can’t – like, they’re not
a very rational
organisation to deal with. They deal with the facts and that’s all they
(Transcript 26 June 2017, p.466 lines 1–12)
341 In circumstances where it would appear that Mr Jess Jnr had an
adequate opportunity to address the point, no breach of the rule
occurred, as was determined by the primary judge (at [889] of the
2018 reasons).
342 We find no merit in this ground.
Ground 22: Erroneous finding as to Mr Jess Jnr’s draft
35. The primary judge erred in finding,
without any evidentiary foundation, that the draft letter sent on 22 June 2010
Jnr to Mr FF “demonstrates a preparedness on Mr Jess
Jnr’s part to construct artificial legal scenarios to further his
ends” [894]. The finding is contrary to the evidence of Mr
343 The appellants argue in support of
this complaint that there is no evidence that the subject email was a
“draft letter”
from Mr Jess Jnr to the husband. With
respect, that argument confronts the obvious difficulty that the terms of the
letter itself
make it clear that it is addressed and composed as a draft letter
to the husband, and Mr FF confirmed in his evidence that it was
understanding that the purpose of it being sent to him was to review its
correctness. Whether or not it was actually ever sent
is not to the point.
344 By its terms the draft letter contained alternatives which comprised
“artificial legal scenarios”. The point of emphasis
Mr Jess Jnr’s email was that it was intended to convey to the
husband that asserting that the DODT was invalid would
not necessarily be
effective to defeat the taxation liability. When the email is read as a whole it
is clear that Mr Jess Jnr is
reflecting the taxation advice received
from Mr O that the ATO would not necessarily be bound by any attempt of the
parties to treat
the DODT as invalid. It is clear enough that
Mr Jess Jnr was promoting the proposition that because the advice of
the taxation expert
was that taking a position that the DODT was invalid would
not avoid the taxation liability, there would be no point in pursuing
345 The appellants’ contention that there was no evidence that
Mr Jess Jnr’s draft 2010 email was a draft letter to the
is plainly wrong given that Mr Jess Jnr himself gave the evidence that
it was as appears in the following exchange:
[QUEEN’S COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: And it’s a
draft email – letter or email to [Mr Jess Snr] and you’re
getting [Mr FF] to have a look at it; is that right?
[MR JESS JNR]: Yes. To make sure I’m not telling [Mr Jess Snr]
anything that’s not correct.
(Transcript 26 June 2017, p.465 lines 17–19)
346 It was not the finding of the primary judge that the alternatives
offered in Mr Jess Jnr’s email were each “artificial
scenarios” or that the email itself constituted an attempt to construct an
artificial legal scenario. The relevant finding
of the primary judge was
simply that the email demonstrated a preparedness on
Mr Jess Jnr’s part to construct an artificial
legal scenario
negating the genuineness of the DODT.
347 No appellable error attends the findings recorded by the
primary judge and there is no merit in this ground.
Ground 23: Evidence erroneously admitted and taken into
36. In circumstances where the
primary judge had earlier ruled that Mr Jess Snr’s evidence be taken
out of turn only in relation
to paragraph 1(a) of the wife’s Amended
Initiating Application filed on 16 April 2014, the primary judge erred in
to and taking into account the extraneous evidence of Mr Jess Snr in
relation to the settlement on 20 September 2009 ([895] and [896])
and extraneous
evidence about the settlement negotiations ([902] and [903]).
37. The primary judge erred in allowing extraneous or irrelevant
matters to guide or affect her in finding that the DODT was not executed
date that it bears by referring in her Reasons ([13], [903] and [904]) to an
affidavit of Mr Jess Jnr sworn on 11 September
2013 in circumstances
(a) that affidavit was filed in support of an earlier interlocutory
injunction application and did not form part of his trial evidence;
(b) Mr Jess Jnr was not cross-examined on that affidavit during the
348 The second of the contentions within this
ground, that is, the challenged reliance by the primary judge upon
Mr Jess Jnr’s
affidavit sworn on 11 September 2013 (at [13],
[903] and [904] of the 2018 reasons) is conveniently dealt with first.
349 This part of the challenge is premised upon the assertion that the
affidavit sworn on 11 September 2013 did not form part of
Jess Jnr’s trial evidence. That premise is incorrect.
350 In his affidavit filed on 27 August 2014 at paragraphs 2 and 3
Mr Jess Jnr deposes as follows:
2. I make this affidavit pursuant to the orders made by
this Court on 16 July 2014 which require me to file an affidavit in relation
paragraph 1(a) of the Applicant Wife’s Amended Initiating Application
filed on 16 April 2014.
In addition to this affidavit I rely on my affidavits sworn on 11
September 2013
, 23 September 2013 and 24 December 2013.
(Emphasis added)
351 Clearly Mr Jess Jnr incorporated his affidavit sworn on 11
September 2013 into his affidavit filed on 27 August 2014. Unsurprisingly
then, when the primary judge records a summary of the evidence (at [43] of
the 2018 reasons), appearing as Annexure 3 to the 2018
reasons, the
affidavit sworn on 11 September 2013 is listed in that annexure.
352 This also dispels the assertion by the appellants that the appellants did
not file any evidence as to the 20 September 2009 settlement.
There being no
attempt by Mr Jess Jnr to correct his affidavit sworn on 11 September
2013, as opposed to simply incorporating it
in his affidavit filed on
27 August 2014, renders the conclusion that there can be no relevant error
or material prejudice to the
appellants in the primary judge having
considered Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence.
353 Notably, reference to the subject paragraphs of the 2018 reasons reflect
that the primary judge did no more than recite
Jnr’s affidavit evidence without making any relevant
354 As to the balance of this complaint, it is clear that the husband’s
evidence was ultimately taken out of sequence in relation
to all issues by
reason of his failing health and, for the same reason, the primary judge
granted considerable latitude as to cross-examination
of the husband by the
appellants. At [64] of the 2018 reasons the primary judge records:
64. The husband’s evidence was taken out of turn
out of concern for his health and the consideration that he may not remain
to give evidence if the trial took its ordinary course. Because of the
husband’s precarious health, his
cross examination was to cover the
evidence which he gave in all of the proceedings and not just the first part now
under consideration.
Because there may not have been an opportunity for the
husband to be recalled, I granted considerable latitude to cross examination.
was initially estimated that the cross examination would take approximately two
days, later four days. It took 23 days. Some days
were shorter having regard to
the husband’s fatigue...
355 To similar effect is [1] of the 2019 reasons as follows:
1. After attempts in 2014 and 2015 had failed to get the
entirety of the applications between the wife, husband and Represented Third
Parties to the barrier, the Represented Third Parties persuaded me that I should
conduct a separate hearing to find whether the Deed
of Declaration of Trust was
executed on 28 February 2002. I granted their application over the opposition of
the wife and the husband.
Orthodoxy had already given way to practicality in
that, in 2015, the husband's health was so poor that it was considered that,
if he survived the trial, he would probably not be fit to give evidence in
turn. I ordered that all of the husband's
evidence and cross
examination was to be taken out of turn and immediately precede a hearing which
would be confined to finding whether
the Deed of Declaration of Trust dated
28 February 2002 was executed on the date that it bears. I stated:
my decision is to separate the hearing, so that the defended hearing dates after
Mr Jess Snr concludes his evidence will be for the
purpose of determining only
the date of the Declaration of Trust and I will make clear at the conclusion
what my finding of fact
is in relation to that. But there won’t actually
be a decision.
(Footnote omitted)
356 It was necessary for the primary judge to consider all relevant
evidence as to the conduct of all relevant parties after 28 February
to be consistent, or inconsistent, with the existence of the DODT from that
357 The primary judge’s discussion of the September 2009
settlement is set out at [895]–[904] of the 2018 reasons. So
husband’s evidence is concerned all that the primary judge records is
a narration of some of the husband’s
evidence including amongst the
recitation of his evidence findings critical of the husband. Ultimately, the
primary judge limited
the use made of the husband’s evidence to an
observation recorded at [897] of the 2018 reasons as follows:
897. ... Ultimately the husband’s evidence on this
point only goes to the fact that
believed that
the settlement date, he would still retain control and be a Director of the XC
following the settlement.
(Emphasis added)
358 No error is demonstrated by the feature that the primary judge
narrated evidence of the husband on this topic given the overall
task of the
primary judge to examine relevant
conduct post-28 February 2002.
Moreover, review of the primary judge’s discussion of this evidence
reveals no more than that
it was narrated by the primary judge without any
specific finding adverse to the appellants’ case being made.
359 We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 24: Erroneous approach to giving evidence
(a) erred in finding; and
(b) failed to give any or sufficient reasons for her finding,
that “it is unusual for a litigant to not read the evidence which is
filed in support of his own case but not sworn by him”
([90]). The finding
is contrary to the authorities, including Day v Perisher Blue
[2005] NSWCA 110
(2005) 62 NSWLR
39. The primary judge erred in finding that Ms C Jess’s lack
of discussion with Mr Jess Jnr about Ms Jess’s allegations,
Jess Jnr’s evidence, her memories of seeing the DODT at the commencement
of their relationship, her recollection of computers
or documents referred to by
Mr SS or meetings with lawyers “is conspicuous and in stark contrast to
her attitude and curiosity
prior to marriage” ([148]) in 2006. The finding
is contrary to the authorities, including Day v Perisher Blue
[2005] NSWCA 110
(2005) 62 NSWLR
, and the evidence of Mr Jess Jnr and Ms C
360 We have some considerable difficulty in seeing
any materiality in the primary judge’s observation, in relation to
Jnr, that “it is unusual for a litigant not to read the
evidence which is filed in support of his own case but not sworn by
(at [90] of the 2018 reasons).
361 That observation was made as part of a lengthier discussion about
Mr Jess Jnr’s presentation as a witness (at [85]–[97]
the 2018 reasons). The observation should be put in its context by reference to
the whole of that expressed by the primary judge
at [90] of the 2018
reasons as follows:
90. It was his evidence that in preparing to give
evidence he did not read other witnesses’ affidavits or witness
In my experience, it is unusual for a
litigant to not read the evidence which is filed in support of his own case but
not sworn by
him. My impression is that this was a strategy to insulate
Mr Jess Jnr from knowledge and to facilitate his “I don’t
know” response. It is also in contrast with the interest that he showed
and his high degree of participation he had in the
husband’s first Family
Court proceedings, which is discussed at paragraphs
of these reasons.
(Tracked changes in original) (As per the original) (Footnote
362 There would not appear to be anything surprising or exceptional in the
primary judge expressing an observation, sourced to her
own experience as a
trial judge, of litigants (and not simply witnesses) usually having read
the evidence filed in support of the
litigant’s own case. Moreover, read
in context the gravamen of [90] of the 2018 reasons is the
primary judge’s impression
that Mr Jess Jnr employed a
strategy to facilitate an “I don’t know” response to questions
as is further discussed
in the 2018 reasons. Notably, the primary judge did
not in fact record any finding rejecting Mr Jess Jnr’s evidence
did not read the affidavits or statements of other witnesses. The
primary judge merely expressed that such conduct of a litigant
consistent with her own experience but in the context of a broader finding
concerning Mr Jess Jnr’s approach to giving
363 The line of authority, including
Day v Perisher Blue Pty Ltd
[2005] NSWCA 110
(2005) 62 NSWLR 731
Day v Perisher Blue
primarily directed to issues of witnesses
their evidence. The
problem which arose in
Day v Perisher Blue
was evidence that the
defendant/employer had brought some pressure to bear on lay witness employees as
to their versions concerning
how the plaintiff’s work accident occurred;
and likewise there was evidence that the defendant’s solicitors exerted
pressure or at least direction in the evidence each of the employee
witnesses was to give. A joint conference with witnesses was
had. That is far
removed from the topic under discussion here.
364 We do not consider that the primary judge was obliged to furnish
reasons for her experience and we do not see that the subject
observation ought
be elevated to the status of a stand alone finding removed from the context in
which it appears.
365 With respect to the primary judge’s assessment of
Ms C Jess and her evidence, we consider it was entirely legitimate to
undertake an assessment of Ms C Jess’s evidence and what the
primary judge observed to be a conspicuous and stark contrast
Ms C Jess’s evidence as to her lack of discussion between
herself and her own husband, both of whom are parties and
both of whom are
directly affected by the proceedings and the issues in this case, and her
attitude and curiosity prior to marriage.
The primary judge undertook a
careful consideration of Ms C Jess’s evidence in this respect
and undertook a careful comparison
of the nature referred to (at
[136]–[141] of the 2018 reasons).
366 It bears repeating that the primary judge made findings that
Mr Jess Jnr and Ms C Jess were not reliable witnesses for a
of reasons well beyond the present topics.
367 We find no substance in this ground.
Ground 25: Failure to provide an opportunity to make oral
submissions
40. The primary judge erred in failing to
give the parties an opportunity to make oral submissions in circumstances
(a) the primary judge told the parties that there “will
probably be something that issues from my chambers with dot points because
you can reflect on them and you might come up with things yourself and then
there would be a mention” (T1495:7-20, 19
July 2017);
(b) nothing was issued from her Honour's chambers, there was no mention
and there was no opportunity given to the parties to make
oral submissions;
(c) the represented third parties were denied the opportunity to address
matters raised by the primary judge for the first time in
The primary judge ought to have given the parties an opportunity to
make oral submissions. If the represented third parties had been
opportunity to make oral submissions the primary judge may not have made
the errors set out in grounds 6, 8, 9, 10 and 23
368 It is important to consider the factual
context of what occurred in the proceedings in assessing this complaint.
369 First, during the final days’ discussion about the course of
written submissions, her Honour first said:
HER HONOUR: Well, I would not be concluding with a
written submissions. I would be calling you back, I think, because there will
be aspects that I want further assistance with.
(Transcript 19 July 2017, p.1494 lines 18–20) (As per the
370 The point of emphasis here is that the primary judge spoke of the
prospect of further submissions only in the event that she required
assistance, albeit that the primary judge thought that would be a
probability.
371 Later in the discussion on that day her Honour said:
HER HONOUR: Six, four, two [in relation to the timing of
written submissions], a mention, probably be in writing because then you
reflect – sorry, rather than a mention, it will probably be something that
issues from my chambers with dot points because
then you can reflect on them and
you might come up with things yourself and then there would be a mention - -
(Transcript 19 July 2017, p.1495 lines 7–10)
372 Again, whilst the primary judge spoke in terms of a
“probability” there was no certainty at all about a further listing
of the matter. There was, as would be obvious, certainly no particular questions
the primary judge could then have had in mind. The
primary judge was
simply allowing for a contingency in the event that there were remaining
questions once her Honour had considered
the written submissions.
373 The appellants filed lengthy written closing submissions traversing every
aspect of the evidence before the Court which they sought
to address to the
primary judge. The appellants’ submissions ran to some 100 pages with
more than 1,000 footnotes. The wife’s
submissions consisted of 81 pages
with 116 footnotes. The appellants’ submissions in reply were a further 59
pages with a further
460 footnotes. In summary, the primary judge
considered a total of 240 pages of detailed written submissions that included
to a total of more than 1,608 footnotes.
374 On the hearing of the appeal we gave leave to the appellants, there being
no objection by the wife or the third respondent, to
receive by way of further
evidence on appeal the affidavit of the solicitor for the appellants filed on 4
September 2020 setting
out communications between the Court and the parties that
occurred following final submissions in the trial.
375 On 24 September 2018 the primary judge’s Associate sent
correspondence to the parties which:
(c) Asked that Queen’s Counsel for the parties
confer as to a suitable date for a mention after 31 October 2018; and
(d) Stated that the primary judge will make an order in Chambers requesting
further information from the parties in sufficient time
for counsel to prepare
any responses.
376 On 16 October 2018 the primary judge’s Associate sent an email
to the parties’ lawyers in which she said that the
matter had been listed
for a further mention at 10.00 am on 2 November 2018.
377 On 31 October 2018 the primary judge’s Associate sent an email
to the parties’ lawyers stating that the primary judge
will not be in
a position to provide questions prior to the current listing on
Friday, 2 November 2018, requesting that the provision
of questions be
delayed for one week and that the matter be listed on 8 or 9 November in lieu of
2 November 2018.
378 On 1 November 2018 Queen’s Counsel for the wife sent an email to
the primary judge’s Associate on behalf of himself
and Queen’s
Counsel for the appellants stating that “[i]t would be most helpful if we
could receive [h]er Honour’s
questions/list of issues to be raised at the
proposed further mention” to determine:
(e) How long each side might need to digest, and be in a
position to respond to those questions; and
(f) How much Court time, if any, will be necessary or whether the matters raised
can be dealt with by further written submissions.
379 On 1 November 2018 the primary judge’s Associate sent an email
to the parties’ lawyers stating that the joint proposal
Counsel for the parties was suitable to her Honour, that the hearing on 2
November 2018 would be vacated and the
parties would be advised “in due
course of an order with questions/list of issues”.
380 On 30 November 2018 the primary judge’s Associate sent an
email to the parties’ lawyers stating that “[h]er
directed that I advise the parties that, further to the letter from Chambers
dated 24 September 2018, there will be no
further mention of this matter or an
order made requesting further information from the parties”.
381 It was on 4 December 2018 that the primary judge published the
December 2018 reasons.
382 It is tolerably clear from the above chronology that whilst the
primary judge may have held a preliminary view that she might
assistance or further assistance by the direction of a list of questions or a
list of issues to be addressed by the parties,
the primary judge ultimately
resolved that this was not required. No error is demonstrated in anything that
transpired concerning
the primary judge’s communications in this
383 This is not a case where the appellants sought an opportunity to make
oral submissions but were denied that opportunity. It was
the primary judge
who raised the prospect that she may need “further assistance” once
she had received and considered
written submissions. In the event,
unsurprisingly given the extent and detailed nature of the submissions received,
the primary judge
did not turn the prospect of a further hearing into a
384 The right to procedural fairness requires that before a person can be
adversely affected by an order that party must be afforded
an adequate
opportunity to be heard (
Allesch v Maunz
[2000] HCA 40
(2000) 203 CLR 172).
appellants were afforded the opportunity to be heard and took that opportunity
by filing extensive written submissions.
385 Nothing which fell from the primary judge either in terms of the
statements the primary judge made in Court as referred to or
the terms of
the order the primary judge made on 19 July 2017, which reserved until the
filing of written submissions the question
of “whether” there would
be a further mention of the matter, rendered it unclear to any interested party
that there would
certainly be some further mention or further opportunity to
make yet further submissions.
386 As is pointed out by the wife, had the appellants sought to make further
oral submissions or to seek a listing to argue for the
right to do so, they had
four days after the 30 November 2018 notice from the Court concerning the
listing of the matter for the
delivery of the 2018 reasons in which to do
387 We also accept the wife’s submission that it is unclear as to any
asserted nexus between this ground of complaint and the
appellants’
complaints about typographical and transcription errors and the alleged pressure
to publish the judgment.
388 In this context the authorities relied upon by the appellants are
directed to the risk that if a trial judge is under pressure
to deliver a
judgment at the last minute, the decision that is easiest to make and express
will have great psychological attraction.
However, when regard is had to the
length and detail of the primary judge’s 2018 reasons, including the
cross-referencing to transcript evidence and exhibits, we do not
see how this decision can be characterised as one being the easiest
to make and
389 We find no merit in this ground.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL IN RESPECT OF ORDER 4 OF THE ORDERS MADE ON
Ground 26: Failure by the primary judge to disqualify
judged erred in failing to disqualify herself from
the further hearing of the proceeding in circumstances where her
(a) had found that a fraud had been committed by Mr Jess Jnr and
(b) had found that Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban and Ms C Jess lacked both credit
and credibility as witnesses; and/or
(c) appeared to have pre-judged two issues in relation to which the
Represented Third Parties had not yet had an opportunity to file
evidence and
make submissions.
42. The primary judge:
(a) misapplied the proper test to determine whether a judge is
disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias; and
(b) failed to find that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably
apprehend that her Honour might not bring an impartial mind to
the remaining
issues still to be determined in this proceeding.
43. The primary judge ought to have:
(a) found that the matters set out in paragraphs 41(a), (b) and/or (c)
might cause a fair minded lay observer reasonably to apprehend
that her Honour
might not bring an impartial mind to the issues still to be determined in this
proceeding; and
(b) disqualified herself from further hearing the
proceeding.
390 On the hearing of the appeal
Queen’s Counsel for the appellants emphasised that this part of the appeal
was not in any way
directed to Order 2 of the orders made on 15
November 2019 regarding the declaration that the DODT was not executed on
the date it
bears. Queen’s Counsel for the appellants sought to
emphasise this as a discrete appeal dealing with the discrete application
to the primary judge that, having regard to the 2018 reasons, it was
no longer possible for the primary judge to preside in
any further hearing
of the proceedings and that she ought recuse herself.
391 Following the delivery of the 2018 reasons the appellants brought an
application that the primary judge recuse herself from the
proceedings.
That application was heard on 6 June 2019 and on 15 November 2019 the
primary judge delivered reasons for judgment and
made Order 4
dismissing the application that she recuse herself.
392 The recusal application is addressed by the primary judge at [31]
and following in the 2019 reasons.
393 At [35]–[41] of the 2019 reasons the primary judge set out the
tests of apprehended bias by reference to the authorities
[2000] HCA 48
(2000) 201 CLR 488
Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy
[2000] HCA 63
(2000) 205 CLR 337
British American Tobacco
Australia Services Ltd v Laurie
(2011) 242 CLR 283
). It is not contended by the appellants that the
primary judge misstated or misapprehended the principles to be applied
a complaint of apprehended bias.
394 Rather, the focus of the appellants’ challenge is upon the
primary judge’s application of principle and it is contended
primary judge misapplied the test by erroneously focusing on whether the
fair-minded lay observer would have agreed with
the primary judge’s
adverse findings, rather than by focusing on whether that observer might
reasonably apprehend that the
primary judge might not bring an impartial
mind to the remaining issues still to be determined by reason of those adverse
The appellants contend that this is made clear from the
primary judge’s statement at [55] of the 2019 reasons as follows:
55. ... Doing the best I can to see the evidence from
the perspective of a
fair-minded lay observer I conclude that he/she would
himself/herself be reasonably sceptical about how the Represented Third Parties
say the terms of the Deed of Declaration of Trust were negotiated. The observer
would be sceptical about how and by whom the Deed
was created and why there were
no records independently of Mr Ban, Mr Jess Jnr and
Ms C Jess as to the existence of the Deed of Declaration
of Trust much
before a critical time in the marriage of the husband and
395 We accept the contention of the appellants that her Honour’s
statement at [55] of the 2019 reasons reflects a misapplication
relevant test. With respect to the primary judge, it is in the
circumstances of this case misplaced to focus upon whether
or not a fair-minded
lay observer would have doubts about the conduct of Mr Jess Jnr,
Ms C Jess and Mr Ban and that therefore there
is no relevant
apprehension. The focus of the test must be upon whether a
fair-minded lay
observer might reasonably apprehend that the primary judge might not bring
an impartial mind to resolution of the
remaining issues still to be determined
in the proceedings.
396 As we have discussed in addressing Grounds 1–25 of this appeal, the
2018 reasons contain numerous seriously adverse findings
as to the credit and
credibility of each of Mr Jess Jnr, Mr Ban and Ms C Jess.
Those findings are expressed in unqualified terms.
That almost inevitably gives
rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. As was observed by the New South
Wales Court of Appeal in
Australian National Industries Ltd v Spedley
Securities Ltd
(1992) 26 NSWLR 411
at 442 (per Mahoney
JA, with whom Meagher JA agreed):
...that a previous decision of the same fact or upon the
credibility of a relevant witness will create such an apprehension, normally
not inevitably.
397 In the 2019 reasons the primary judge referred at some length to the
decision of Besanko J in
Bob Jane Corporation Pty Ltd v ACN 149 801 141
[2015] FCA 1343
, a case to which she was referred by the applicants
in the application for recusal (now the appellants). Her Honour discussed
case at [67]–[70] of the 2019 reasons and it is useful to set out
that discussion given our acceptance of Besanko J’s
discussion and
application of the relevant principles:
67. Mr Waller relied otherwise on the decision of
Besanko J of the Federal Court of Australia,
Bob Jane Corporation Pty Ltd v
ACN 149 801 141 Pty Ltd
[2015] FCA 1343
, Besanko J determined that he should
recuse himself from hearing a second contempt application. The matter involved
the husband.
Mr Waller appeared for Bob Jane Corporation Proprietary Limited on
the instructions of husband. Orders were made by Besanko J that
husband not
trade as a business under a name that includes “Jane” or trade as a
business under or by reference to a trade
mark that is deceptively similar to
the “Bob Jane” trademark. Besanko J held that husband and a number
of the other respondents
had been guilty of contempt of such orders. He had
stated in his reasons when making the original orders (
Bob Jane Corporation
Pty Ltd v ACN 149 801 141 Pty Ltd
[2014] FCA 637):
16. Thirdly, as I have already noted, the fourth respondent swore two
affidavits which were tendered at the hearing. In addition,
he was cross
examined by counsel for the applicant. Although by the time all the evidence was
in there were not many factual disputes
between the parties, I did not find the
fourth respondent’s evidence particularly convincing. I say that because
in a number
of areas I thought I was given only half of the story, and some of
the explanations were not wholly convincing...Finally, I mention
a matter which,
on the face of it, appears to be quite a minor matter, but which nevertheless
affected my confidence in the reliability
of the fourth respondent’s
evidence. In his first affidavit sworn on 4 March 2014, the fourth respondent
said that he had forwarded
the resolution changing the second respondent’s
name to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission
whereas in his second affidavit sworn on 6 March 2014, he
said that he did that between swearing his affidavit of 4 March 2014 and
affidavit of 6 March 2014. If in fact that is to be explained by a distinction
between the resolution and the Notification of
Resolution, then that should have
been made clear in the fourth respondent’s affidavit.
56. Before leaving the findings I have made as to each of the contempts, I
should record the fact that I think each breach was wilful
and in contumacious
disregard for the orders made on 26 November 2013 (see
TiVo Inc v Vivo
International Corporation Pty Ltd
[2013] FCA 1340
, at [8] per Pagone J). The
fourth respondent was aware of the content of the orders and he made no effort
to comply, or cause the
other respondents to comply, until shortly prior to the
hearing. He sought to deflect responsibility to comply with the orders by
suggesting that in some way they fell within proceedings in the Family
68. Besanko J relied on
Eber, Livesey
R v Watson; Ex Parte
[1976] HCA 39
(1976) 136 CLR 248
apprehended bias test, and stated:
Ordinarily, a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge
might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution
of the question the judge is
required to decide where the judge in a previous case has expressed clear views,
either about a question
of fact which constitutes a live and significant issue
in the subsequent case, or about the credit of a witness whose evidence is
significance on such a question

Association

The Queen v Watson; Ex
[1976] HCA 39
(1976) 136 CLR 248
at 265-266 per Barwick CJ, Gibbs,
Stephen and Mason JJ.)
It has been said many times that judges do not choose their cases and they have
a duty to sit on the cases which have been assigned
or allocated to them. A
judge should not accede too readily to applications that he or she disqualify
themselves for bias. Having
said that, the High Court said there may be cases
where the objection is substantial and it may be appropriate for the judge to
himself or herself in a case of real doubt:
Re JRL; Ex parte

(1986) 161 CLR 342
at 352 per Mason J;
at 348 [19]
There will be cases which are not black and white where a decision-maker has
gone some way towards revealing a view about an issue
of fact or an issue of
credit. That might come about because a decision-maker has made a general
statement and is asked to disqualify
himself or herself in a subsequent case
involving a specific example said to relate to the general statement. It might
because of a provisional statement or finding in a matter and then an
application for disqualification (

(2000) 201 CLR 488
per Gleeson GJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). The question is
not whether the decision maker’s mind is blank, but
whether it is open to
persuasion:
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia
(2001) 205 CLR 507 (“
”) at 531 [7] per Gleeson
CJ and Gummow J.
I have considered, in relation to the observations set out in paragraphs 16 and
56 of the June 2014 reasons, whether I expressed
final or merely provisional
conclusions. It is to be remembered that I am to answer this question not by
what I intended, but by
what a fair-minded lay observer would understand the
words to mean. I think he or she would consider that I had formed an adverse
view of the fourth respondent’s credit and reliability. I do not think it
matters how important the observations were in terms
of the issues but, in any
event, they could not be considered merely peripheral.
I have considered whether the fourth respondent’s credit could be in issue
on the applicant’s application. I frame the
issue in this way because it
is always possible that he will not give evidence or the case will be decided on
an unrelated ground
or matter. I am entitled to be satisfied that there is at
least a reasonable possibility the fourth respondent’s credit will
issue. I am so satisfied having regard to his affidavit and the fact that he is
the respondent to the charge. At the same time,
I do not think that the fourth
respondent must establish as a matter of certainty that his credit and
reliability will be in issue.
Having regard to the above matters, I am satisfied that I should disqualify
myself from hearing this proceeding because I have previously
made findings in
relation to the fourth respondent’s credibility and there is sufficient
prospect that his credibility will
be in issue in this proceeding. I will order
that the applicant’s application be transferred to another judge for
hearing and
determination.
69. The Represented Third Parties submit that in
Bob Jane Corporation Pty Ltd
v ACN 149 801 141 Pty Ltd
[2015] FCA 1343
, where the findings made were
“moderate” and Basenko J was not satisfied with certainty that
issues of credit would be
raised again in the contempt application, Basenko J
recused himself nonetheless.
70. The distinguishing feature between
Bob Jane Corporation Pty Ltd v ACN
149 801 141 Pty Ltd
and this case is that Basenko J had concluded a
discrete application in the proceedings, a contempt application, where as we are
part way through a trial in which I have heard the husband’s evidence and
saw it tested.
(As per the original) (Footnotes omitted)
398 As can be seen from [71] of the 2019 reasons the primary judge
distinguished this case from that before Besanko J on the basis
case before Besanko J concerned credit findings made in a separate
proceeding.
399 With respect to the primary judge, that distinction would appear to
overlook what the High Court has said in numerous cases, including
v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong
[1976] HCA 39
(1976) 136 CLR 248
Livesey v NSW
Bar Association
[1983] HCA 17
(1983) 151 CLR 288
(at 300) and
Heydon, Kiefel and Bell JJ stated:
145. Whenever a judge is asked to try an issue which he
or she has previously determined, whether in the same proceedings or in
proceedings, and whether between the same parties or different
parties, the judge will be aware that different evidence may be led
at the later
400 In the circumstances of this unusual case, a reasonable observer might
possibly apprehend that at the trial the Court might not
move its mind from the
position reached on one set of materials, even if different materials were
presented at the trial.
401 In this case, we accept the submission of the appellants that a
reasonable observer, having read the various serious credit and
fraud findings
that the primary judge made adverse to the appellants in one stage of the
proceedings, might reasonably apprehend
that her Honour might not move her mind
in dealing with issues of credit in the next phase of the proceedings.
We accept that the
primary judge’s approach reflects an error in
the application of the test.
402 One exception to the apprehension of bias rule is the doctrine of
necessity which is raised by the Notice of Contention filed
on 3 January 2020 by
the third respondent.
403 The doctrine of necessity is principally directed to a situation where
the members of a court or tribunal are affected by an apprehension
of bias and
in such a case, the rule of necessity applies to ensure that the court or
tribunal is not prevented from performing its
statutory function.
Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal
[1990] HCA 31
(1990) 170 CLR 70
Mason CJ and Brennan J observed at 88–89:
The second reason for rejecting the appellant's case is
that, in any event, even if, contrary to the view which we have expressed,
be a case for holding that a reasonable apprehension of bias attaches to all the
members of the Tribunal, the operation of
the rule of necessity would ensure
that the Tribunal is not disabled from performing its statutory functions. The
rule of necessity
permits a member of a court who has some interest in the
subject-matter of the litigation to sit in a case when no judge without
interest is available to sit:
Dimes v. Proprietors of Grand Junction
. The existence of the principle has been recognized in this Court
by Isaacs J. in
Dickason v. Edwards
, and by Brennan and Deane JJ. in
Builders’ Registration Board
of Queensland v. Rauber
latter case, Brennan J. had no hesitation in holding that the principle applied
to a statutory tribunal as well as to a court.
And Deane J. acknowledged that
this might be so. The conclusion reached by Brennan J. upon this point conforms
to principle and to
received opinion in other common law jurisdictions: see the
citations in
. The rule of necessity gives expression to the
principle that the rules of natural justice cannot be invoked to frustrate the
operation of a statute which sets up a tribunal and requires it to
perform the statutory functions entrusted to it. Or, to put the
matter another
way, the statutory requirement that the tribunal perform the functions assigned
to it must prevail over and displace
the application of the rules of natural
justice. Those rules may be excluded by statute:
Twist v. Randwick Municipal
Salemi v. MacKellar
FAI Insurances Ltd. v.
(Footnotes omitted)
404 Whilst Deane J expressed agreement with Mason CJ and Brennan J, his
Honour also emphasised some qualifications to the rule of
necessity in the
following terms at 96:
I agree with Mason C.J. and Brennan J. that the rule of
necessity is, in an appropriate case, applicable to a statutory administrative
tribunal, as it is to a court, to prevent a failure of justice or a frustration
of statutory provisions. That rule operates to qualify
the effect of what would
otherwise be actual or ostensible disqualifying bias so as to enable the
discharge of public functions in
circumstances where, but for its operation, the
discharge of those functions would be frustrated with consequent public or
detriment. There are, however, two prima facie qualifications of the
rule. First, the rule will not apply in circumstances where
its application
would involve positive and substantial injustice since it cannot be presumed
that the policy of either the legislature
or the law is that the rule of
necessity should represent an instrument of such injustice. Second, when the
rule does apply, it applies
only to the extent that necessity
405 Gaudron & McHugh JJ observed at 102:
Our conclusion that no reasonable bystander would
reasonably fear that the members of the Tribunal would bring unfair or
minds to the inquiry makes it unnecessary for us to determine whether
the doctrine of necessity applies to the case of a person who
is reasonably
suspected of prejudging an issue which arises for decision by him or her.
Whatever the precise scope of the doctrine
of necessity in the natural justice
context, it seems contrary to all principles of fairness that, on the ground of
necessity, a
person should have to submit to a decision made by a person who has
already prejudged the issue. Likewise, there seems much to be
said for the view
that, in the absence of a contrary statutory intention, the ground of necessity
should not require a person to
submit to a decision made or to be made by a
person who is reasonably believed to have prejudged the
406 We are not persuaded that the doctrine of necessity has any application
to the present case as regards this Court or a single
judge of this Court.
407 The third respondent emphasises the fact of the husband’s death
since giving his evidence before the primary judge. However,
as has been
discussed, the husband was
cross-examined extensively in the proceedings and
a transcript of his evidence was taken. In
Heydon, Kiefel
& Bell JJ observed:
left open the question whether
special circumstances may also amount to an exception to the rule. This appeal
does not raise for
consideration what special circumstances might justify a
judge sitting to determine a case despite being reasonably suspected of
pre-judged an issue. The fact that Judge Curtis took the evidence of the
late Mr Laurie at his bedside is not relied upon
in this respect. In
circumstances in which the evidence was transcribed and video-recorded, such a
contention would have been forlorn.
(Footnote omitted)
408 Whilst that observation was made in the context of “special
circumstances”, being another exception which may operate
apprehended bias arises, it is clearly analogous.
409 The third respondent also relies upon the decision of the High Court in
, which dealt with two appeals heard together in which it was argued
that the trial judge in each case ought be disqualified by reason
shares in the ANZ Bank. In one case, after the judge had completed the hearing
of the case over an extended period of
some 18 days, judgment was reserved.
Subsequently a critical witness in the case died. Also, the judge’s mother
passed away
resulting in the judge inheriting ANZ Bank shares. It was in that
context that the High Court considered the doctrine of necessity,
observed by the High Court the witness who died was one whose credibility was of
central importance to the issues in the case.
Obviously if the trial judge were
disqualified it would have required another judge to start from the very
410 There are distinguishing features of this case to the circumstances that
did not involve a case of reasonable
apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment on matters of credit. It concerned
disqualification
by reason of the trial judge’s pecuniary interest.
Further, in this case there would be no requirement for any evidence of
husband to be revisited or reheard. Whilst Kirby J dissented in
his observations as follows are apposite:
178. It was suggested that the special circumstances of
“necessity” applied in
. This was so, as it was put,
because the trial had been long, the decision delayed, an important witness had
died and the pecuniary
interest arose unexpectedly after the decision was
reserved. Callaway JA in the Court of Appeal regarded the exception of necessity
as being attracted by the strong reasons of convenience and advantage that
warranted delivery of the reserved judgment and the fact
that this was required
to ensure the conclusion of a “fair trial”. In the context of
disqualification for undisclosed
pecuniary interest, this case presents the
issue as to how much inconvenience can justify a conclusion of necessity. If the
were disqualified by operation of law for the
undisclosed direct pecuniary interest, a second trial could undoubtedly be had
a different judge. True, there would be disadvantages to both parties by
reason of the passage of time and the burden of ultimate
costs. There would be a
special disadvantage to the bank because of the death of an important witness.
Whether or not that witness’s
testimony would in any case be admissible
under Victorian law, counsel for the appellant in
undertook before
the Court of Appeal that no objection to the tender of that witness's testimony
would be raised in a retrial. This
undertaking was renewed before this Court in
the special leave hearing.
179. In my view, this case does not attract the exception of necessity. So to
hold would be seriously to debase this notion. Retrial
would be inconvenient,
costly and a serious burden on the parties and the community. But that is
commonly the case where courts conclude
that a judge, who has conducted a trial,
was disqualified. Retrial is the price that is paid by our system of law for
upholding fundamental
legal and civil rights. It is a price worth paying if it
reinforces the community’s confidence in the administration of justice
demonstrates the important principle that judges, under our law, do not
participate in the determination of the rights of parties
in which they have a
direct, significant and, in this case, undisclosed interest.
(Footnotes omitted)
411 In this case it is not a matter of retrial but the further hearing of the
proceedings.
412 It was not suggested by any party before us that if the
primary judge was disqualified from further hearing of the proceedings
this would involve a fresh hearing of the case in its entirety before another
judge. What would be required here is the Court
embarking upon a determination
of the balance of the issues to be determined.
413 We are not persuaded that the doctrine of necessity applies in this case
as an exception where apprehended bias is established.
414 The third respondent’s Notice of Contention raises only the rule of
necessity. That is, the Notice of Contention does not
agitate waiver as an
exception. No Notice of Contention was filed by the wife. Moreover, as the 2019
reasons reflect, no party raised
in argument before the primary judge
waiver as an applicable exception if apprehended bias was otherwise
established.
415 Notwithstanding this, the wife seeks to agitate on appeal the proposition
that the appellants have waived their right to seek
that the primary judge
recuse herself on the basis of apprehended bias by reason of their application
in the proceedings below to
have the finding of fact in relation to the DODT
determined as a preliminary issue. The appellants object to this being raised
the first time on appeal. There is substance in the appellants’
objection in this respect given that this point was not raised
primary judge.
416 However, in circumstances where we consider there can be no operative
waiver in the circumstances of this case we propose to deal
417 There is ample authority for the proposition that a party to civil
proceedings may waive an objection to a judge who would otherwise
disqualified on the ground of actual bias or reasonable apprehension of bias. If
a party to civil proceedings, or the legal representative
of that party, knows
of the circumstances that give rise to the disqualification but acquiesces in
the proceedings by not taking
objection it will likely be held that the party
has waived the objection (see,
Vakauta v Kelly
[1989] HCA 44
(1989) 167 CLR 568
Vakauta v Kelly
”) (at 577–579 per Dawson J);
Smits v Roche
(2006) 227 CLR 423
(at 439–440) and
Michael Wilson
& Partners Ltd v Nicholls
(2011) 244 CLR 427 (“
”) (at 449)).
418 We are unaware of any authority, and none was cited to us, for the
proposition that a party, in advance of any apprehension arising,
may forever
waive the right to seek recusal. In other words, that by seeking a preliminary
determination in the present case the
appellants were, in effect, waiving in
advance, forever, any right to seek the primary judge’s recusal
irrespective of the
manner in which the primary judge determined that
preliminary issue and irrespective of the findings made.
419 We consider that the authorities make it clear that the doctrine of
waiver in this context depends upon a litigant being fully
aware of the
circumstances in which apprehended bias might be inferred. That is, that the
circumstances are then known to the litigant.
For example, in
Toohey J observed at 587:
There is no reason why, in authority or in principle,
a litigant who is fully aware of the circumstances from which ostensible bias
might be inferred, should not be capable of waiving
the right later to object to
the judge continuing to hear and dispose of the case
(Emphasis added)
420 Toohey J further observed at 588:
Once it is accepted that there was bias, at any rate
ostensible bias, in the judgment itself, no question of waiver or estoppel can
then arise. What was delivered was a reserved judgment, without any opportunity
for counsel to question what it contained.
421 Obviously, in most civil litigation a litigant enters into the case with
the prospect that the trial judge might make adverse
credit findings, at
least in any case where the versions of parties or witnesses are diametrically
opposed. It would seem an extraordinary
proposition that a litigant, conscious
of that prospect, has waived the right to seek a recusal by embarking upon the
process irrespective
of a reasonable apprehension of bias.
422 We are not persuaded that the doctrine of waiver applied as an exception
to the operation of apprehended bias in this case.
423 We are satisfied that the test for apprehended bias was met in this case
and that the primary judge ought to have recused herself
in circumstances
where neither necessity nor waiver operated as exceptions.
424 The wife submits, by reference to the tentative views expressed by the
Full Court of the Family Court in
Bowcott & Welling
[2016] FamCAFC 144
”), that leave to appeal is required with
respect to the recusal appeal.
the Full Court addressed the question of leave to
appeal (at [80]–[87]), noting that these were tentative views as these
expressed without the benefit of full argument (at [88]). The Full
Court there noted that leave to appeal has not previously been
deemed necessary
to challenge the dismissal of a disqualification application by reference to
earlier authorities but considered
the question of whether a “decree or
decision” disposing of a disqualification application must be
“interlocutory”
since it does not finally determine rights. The Full
Court referred to the authorities discussed in
[2015] WASCA 247
426 There would not appear to be much doubt on the authorities that a
decision by a judge in civil proceedings to refuse an application
for the judge
to recuse himself or herself on account of reasonable apprehension of bias is
interlocutory in nature, even though
that may constitute a final determination
by that judge that the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant do
not establish
the relevant apprehension. As is noted in
Michael Wilson
(at [78] and following) in general any interlocutory order which affects the
final result can be challenged in an appeal against
final judgment.
427 The discussion in
Michael Wilson
(at [70] and following) would
seem to support the proposition that the refusal of a trial judge to accede to
an application for recusal
is an interlocutory determination attracting the
requirement of leave to appeal.
428 We consider, adopting the reasoning applied in
, that leave
to appeal is required to appeal from the determination by the primary judge
to dismiss the application for recusal. However,
we are satisfied that applying
the relevant test for the grant of leave to appeal as set out in
(2016) FLC 93-692 at [42], namely, whether the decision is attended
by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full
whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the
decision to be wrong, that test is met.
429 The appellants ought have leave to appeal from Order 4 made on 15
November 2019 and that order ought be set aside. An order should
be made by this
Court requiring that the further hearing of the proceedings be heard by a judge
other than the primary judge.
ORDERS AND COSTS
430 For the reasons expressed we make the orders
set out at the commencement of these reasons.
431 Whilst we sought and entertained some submissions as to costs at the
hearing of the appeal, and these need not be repeated by
the respective parties,
we also discussed at the hearing the prospect of allowing the parties to make
further submissions when the
outcome of the appeal proceedings was known. We
have resolved that this is the appropriate course.
432 We therefore propose to include in our orders a timetable for some
further written submissions to be received from the parties
on the question of
costs of the appeal proceedings in light of a known outcome. We emphasise that
there is no need for any party
to repeat any submission already made on the
question of costs.

thirty-two (432) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment
