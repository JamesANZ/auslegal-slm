Leathley v Hall [2014] SARTT 6370 (27 November 2014)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 27 NOVEMBER
Hearing 27 November 2014 at Adelaide
LEATHLEY v HALL
(RT14/6370)
Whether or not a residential tenancy exists – legal relationship not
present - no binding agreement.
This is the determination of an application lodged with the Tribunal on 6
November 2014 by the applicant’s representative seeking
payment of rent
arrears and associated orders as set out in the application.
Sworn or affirmed evidence was given by
Applicant’s representative: Dorothy Leathley (applicant’s
Respondent’s representative: Michael Hall (respondent’s son)
Damian McCleave (respondent’s friend)
At the hearing Ms Leathley, gave evidence that the applicant is currently
incarcerated and she is managing his affairs. Ms Leathley
gave evidence to the
Tribunal that her son was living with the respondent, Josephine Hall and her
son, Michael Hall for a period
of about twelve months.
Ms Hall is the maternal grandmother of Mr Leathley’s four children.
Ms Leathley was of the view that a residential tenancy agreement existed in
that Ms Hall was required to pay $300.00 per week following
Leathley’s incarceration, which occurred around February 2013.
Mr Hall gave evidence that he and his mother continued to look after the
property as well as Mr Leathley’s dogs, following his
incarceration, until
Hall had made some mortgage
payments directly into Mr Leathley’s property
loan account, the last of which occurred in February 2014.
Considering all of the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that a
residential tenancy agreement was in place. There is no written
agreement and
there is no evidence of regular payments ever having been made towards rent. I
am not satisfied that there was a legal
relationship between the parties by
which Ms Hall agreed to make regular rent payments in consideration of being
permitted to live
in the property.
Therefore there is no jurisdiction under the
Residential Tenancies Act 1995
for the Tribunal to base an order for the payment of rent arrears.
Application is dismissed
