Introduction
17 October 2025, the court delivered reasons for judgment in these actions

Estate Proceeding

28 October 2025, the court heard from the parties as to the orders which should
be made in the actions to give effect to the reasons,
including as to the
appropriate costs orders.
were made on that date that an account be undertaken on a wilful default basis
to ascertain the quantum of the loss suffered
by the Estate, arising from the
breach of the executor's duty. An account has also been ordered to ascertain
the quantum of the
loss arising from the breach by Mr Quarles of his duties as a
director of Moyle Holdings.
have adjourned the question as to the relief which should be granted in several
other respects until the conclusion of the account
process, including as to the
costs between Mr Moyle and Mr Quarles in the Estate Proceeding, and between
Moyle Holding and Mr Quarles
in the Company Proceeding.
remaining issue, on which I heard submissions from the parties at the hearing on
28 October 2025, is the question whether indemnity
costs should be ordered
in favour of QPL, as against Moyle Holdings, in the Company Proceeding, given
the existence of rejected settlement
offers purportedly made in accordance with
the principles in
Calderbank v
I have addressed that issue in these reasons.
claims against QPL
claims had been advanced by Moyle Holdings at trial, both of which I concluded
should be dismissed.
a claim was advanced that QPL breached a term of the contract implied by law
between the parties, to the effect that QPL would exercise
the professional
care, skill and diligence of an accountant and financial advisor in carrying
or assisting in the directorial and
managerial services for Moyle Holdings. See Reasons [781] to [825].
Moyle Holdings alleged that, by reason of the contractual engagement of QPL, QPL
owed a tortious duty of care to Moyle Holdings
to exercise the professional
care, skill and diligence of an accountant and financial advisor in carrying out
or assisting in the
directorial and managerial services for the plaintiff. See
Reasons [826] to [833].
is no dispute the action brought by Moyle Holdings as against QPL should be
dismissed, having regard to the court's reasons.
I made an order to that effect
on 28 October 2025, in accordance with the Reasons at [781] to [833] and
position of QPL as to costs
sought a costs order that Moyle Holdings pay QPL's costs of the action, to be
assessed as follows:

substance, the terms of the First QPL Offer were that QPL would pay to Moyle
Holdings the sum of $75,000 (inclusive of costs),
the claim would be dismissed
and there would be no order as to costs. The First QPL Offer was contained in a
two page letter from
the solicitors for QPL, Barry Nilsson. Some features of
the letter ought be noted.
the second defendant's solicitors explained that they maintained the view there
was no prospect of Moyle Holdings being successful
should the action proceed to
the solicitors described the plaintiff's case as involving an artificial view of
the actions of Mr Quarles, without regard to the
underling factual basis and
circumstances in which Mr Quarles was acting. A range of factual matters and
aspects of the proceeding
were noted by the solicitors, not all of which the
court has accepted. In essence, the letter sought to persuade the reader that
the factual basis for the Moyle Holdings' claim would not be sustained at trial,
and the claim against QPL would fail.
the letter set out the terms of the offer as follows, which included a proposed
deed of settlement and resolution of claims beyond
those raised in the
proceedings (see [4(c)] and [4(d)]
the matters set out above, with a view to avoiding the on-going costs in
defending this Action, we are instructed to make
the following offer on behalf
of our client:
(a) Our client will pay your client the total sum of $75,000 inclusive of costs
and interest (Settlement Sum);
(b) The Action, as against our client, be dismissed with no orders as to
(c) Our respective clients enter into a deed of settlement, on terms to be
agreed with you, which will incorporate full releases
between our respective
clients in relation to the services provided by our client to your client and

(d) The settlement is in full and final settlement of all claims arising
directly or indirectly out of, or in any way connected to
the services provided
by our client to your client, including (but not limited to) the matters raised
in the Action; and
(e) The Settlement Sum will be paid within 28 days of the parties duly executing
the foreshadowed deed of

it immediately lapses.

Offer was generous. It provided the plaintiff
with 'an opportunity to dispense
with an unmeritorious claim without incurring further costs, without incurring
liability for the

Holdings accepts it should pay QPL's costs. It opposes those costs being
assessed on an indemnity basis, however.
for Moyle Holdings emphasised that the mere fact that the recipient of a
offer is ultimately worse off than they would have been had the offer
been accepted, does not mean that the rejection of the offer
was unreasonable.
Holdings submits, in the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for Moyle
Holdings to reject the offer. Two points are highlighted
in this regard.
it is said the terms of the offer were not clear. The offer was subject to
further negotiation to agree the terms of a deed. No
proposed terms were
offered or suggested. In short, the offer letter did not sufficiently define
the terms of the agreement, which
would then be reduced into a deed. Rather, the
letter expressly identified that further negotiation and agreement was required
order to implement the offer. It is submitted that it was not unreasonable to
...that is, in truth, subject to further negotiation (particularly given there
was no certainty agreement would be reached). This
raises a question as to
whether the offer was a valid
offer at all. But in any
event, it could not be unreasonable to reject an offer that was not certain, not
capable of immediate acceptance
and subject to further negotiation between the
parties (and it being uncertain whether that further negotiation would have been
the offer described as being broader than resolving the present proceedings.
Specifically, it was submitted that, by the First
QPL Offer, QPL sought full
releases in relation to the services provided by QPL to Moyle Holdings. It was
submitted that such a
term went beyond the scope of the issues in the proceeding
and no order could have been made following judgment to release QPL from
claims that Moyle Holdings might have against QPL. Such claims were not the
subject of the Company Proceeding and it was not
appropriate for the offer to be
subject to such releases being given. Yet, it was submitted, the offer was
conditional on full releases
being given.

incorporated into settlement
(3) Inclusion
of extraneous terms
counsel made reference to authorities in which courts had considered the effect
on the efficacy of a
of the inclusion of what might broadly be described as extraneous terms.
Wirepa v Hill (No
the Supreme Court of New South Wales made indemnity costs orders against a
plaintiff based on the unreasonable rejection of a
offer. By way of obiter
comments, Slattery J observed that he would not have made an indemnity costs
order based upon the second
such offer, which had been drafted in different
terms to the first offer.
second offer in that case dealt with the terms of the proposed deed of
settlement and release in more detail than the first offer.
In particular, the
offer stated that a deed of settlement and release would be prepared to reflect
the terms, 'which shall include:
(a) mutual releases; (b) non-disparagement
clauses; and (c) confidentiality clauses'.
Honour indicated that the inclusion of mutual releases was a reasonable and
integral part of a settlement offer on
terms. Indeed, Slattery J
noted that this would have been the effect of the outcome of the proceedings
upon the entry of judgment,
which would have had the effect of ending the
proceedings between the
Honour expressed a different conclusion in relation to the inclusion of the
disparagement and confidentiality clauses.
J noted that the inclusion of such clauses in
offer would
'probably have made the
letter ineffective, as rejection of the offer would have been
reasonable'.
This was because such requirements stipulated an outcome which the defendants in
that case could
have achieved in
the litigation.
for the plaintiff referred me to a decision of the Supreme Court of South
Australia, in
Ecosol Pty Ltd (No
In that case, Blue J considered an application for indemnity costs in connection
with the dismissal of a defamation action. More
had been made by the successful defendant. The terms of the relevant offer
included terms as to the sale of various shares,
the discontinuance of the
actions with no order as to costs, the settlement being strictly confidential
and subject to confidentiality
provisions, the settlement being subject to full
releases, and the settlement being subject to non-disparagement
J described the terms of the offer as being 'very different to an offer to
consent to judgment'. His Honour described the term
of the second offer as to
the release of 'any other potential claim' against certain parties as being
extraneous to the action, as
were the terms dealing
(a) the sale of the shares;
(b) the proposed obligation not to disparage the opposite parties in future;
(c) the obligation to keep the terms of settlement
confidential.
Honour explained his assessment of these extraneous terms, in the context of the
'better off analysis' and the 'unreasonable
non-acceptance analysis', as
[132] The mere fact that the offer included a term providing for the sale of Mr
Slater’s shares does not automatically, in
and of itself, preclude the
making of a special costs order by reason of Mr Slater’s non-acceptance.
However, it does impact
the better off analysis and the unreasonable
non-acceptance analysis.
[133] In relation to the sale of the Slater shares, Mr Slater had demonstrated a
very high, if not all-consuming, interest in his
shares in Ecosol. He had no
obligation to sell them for any price. Ecosol and Mr Smith did not adduce
evidence of the monetary value
of those shares. This renders it impossible to
undertake the better off analysis. In addition, the inclusion of this
condition is an additional reason, further to the reasons given below
in respect of the third offer, why it was not unreasonable
for Mr Slater to
reject the offer.
[134] The inclusion of the term relating to release of any other potential claim
against Ecosol or Mr Smith also does not automatically,
in and of itself,
preclude the making of a special costs order by reason of Mr Slater’s
non-acceptance. However, it does impact
the better off analysis and the
unreasonable non-acceptance analysis.
[135] Again Mr Slater had demonstrated a very high interest in what he regarded
as egregious conduct by Ecosol and Mr Smith. He
had no obligation to release
them from any other claims. It is impossible to assess the value of such a
release. This renders it
impossible to undertake the better off analysis. In
addition, the inclusion of this extraneous condition is an additional reason,
further to the reasons given below in respect of the third offer, why it was not
unreasonable for Mr Slater to have rejected the
[136] Even without those two extraneous provisions, I would have concluded (for
the reasons given below in relation to the third
Ecosol offer) that the
non-acceptance of the first Ecosol offer should not give rise to a special costs
is apparent from his Honour's reasons that he had similar concerns in relation
to the terms included in the third
inclusion of mutual releases concerning claims known and unknown was the subject
of consideration by Elkaim AJ in
Oliveri Legal Pty Ltd v
Cassegrain Tea Tree Oil Pty Ltd (No
In his Honour's
reasons, he
noted there was 'some substance' to the point taken about the inclusion of the
mutual releases. His Honour accepted
that 'a settlement of proceedings will
often include terms to ensure that the whole of the dispute between the parties
is finalised',
but expressed the view that 'the extension to
any possible future claim
renders the
rejection of the offers to be not
unreasonable'.
Nonetheless,
his Honour proceeded to conclude that an indemnity costs order was appropriate,
having regard to the recipient party's
failure to respond to the offer,
recognising that party 'could have suggested an amendment to the release or some
other term with
which it was
comfortable'.
His Honour had regard to the size of the offer, and the time it was made, and
concluded that an award of indemnity costs was 'fair
and just' in the exercise
of the discretion.

addressed a
costs question
at [74] to [85]. There were multiple offers and counter-offers in the case.
The relevant initial settlement offer
had been expressed to be subject to the
drafting of terms of settlement containing 'standard mutual releases, mutual
non-disparagement
clauses and a confidentiality clause', with the responsive
offer indicating its preparedness to consider documenting the settlement
fully in terms 'which may also include [a] non-disparagement clause and a

concluded that the appellant had acted unreasonably in not accepting either
offer (and, in particular, the second
Court of Appeal unanimously rejected this ground of appeal. The following
points explain their analysis.
the court accepted that the clarity with which an offer is expressed is relevant
to determining whether it was unreasonable of the
offeree not to accept it, but
emphasised that the reasonableness of a party not accepting an offer of
settlement must be judged against
all the relevant
circumstances.
the offer in question had made clear what subjects would be covered in
the terms of the settlement, distinguishing the facts in
That was a matter in which Campbell J had refused an application for special
costs 'because the offer required the parties to enter
into a deed of settlement
with no way of knowing what it would contain, such that acceptance of the offer
would result in a contract
that was void for
uncertainty'.
In the instant case being considered by the Court of Appeal, their Honours were
of the view that the recipient of the offer could
reasonably understand the
boundaries of the offer, having been 'plainly spelt out together with standard
releases and other clauses
commonly found in terms of
settlement'.
the Court of Appeal gave weight to the appellant's own letter in response, which
had included an offer to settle the proceedings,
and which in effect indicated
it had no difficulty with subsequently documenting such terms. Indeed, the
letter stated that, 'If
the offer above is accepted our clients are prepared to
consider more fully documenting the settlement in terms acceptable to the

Court of Appeal concluded:
[79] In the circumstances, there was every reason to think, as the judge found,
that if the substantive terms of [the respondent's]
offer had been acceptable to

with the matters yet
to be specifically spelt out. Those matters were of a kind
typically contained in terms of settlement and both parties indicated
preparedness to discuss such matters once the commercial dispute was
[80] In the circumstances, the fact that these matters were not the subject of
express stipulation in the offer did not deprive
the offer of clarity or make it
reasonable for [the appellant] not to accept it.
Disposition
The authorities which I have discussed above serve to reinforce two points,
which stand as general principles in this field. The
first is that a
offer will not justify an
award of indemnity costs unless its rejection was unreasonable. The second is
that all of the relevant
facts and circumstances must be considered in
determining this question.
these authorities support an approach that, where a
offer includes additional
or extraneous aspects beyond the boundaries of the relief sought in the
proceedings and beyond the issues
raised in the proceedings, it is necessary
that the court, in undertaking the necessary analysis, give careful attention
(a) the clarity of the offer, and whether the recipient was able to comprehend
the scope of the offer, in an objective sense; and
(b) whether the inclusion of extraneous matters complicates (or indeed renders
impossible) the assessment as to whether the non-acceptance
of the offer was
unreasonable and whether the offeree would have been better off if he or she had
accepted the offer, relative to
the outcome achieved through the court's
The analysis is necessarily fact sensitive.
Having regard to these principles, I consider the contention advanced by Moyle
Holdings should be accepted. I find that QPL has
not discharged the onus of
persuading the court that the rejection of the First QPL Offer (or the Second
QPL Offer, for that matter)
was unreasonable. I have reached that view for the
following reasons.
it must be accepted that the First QPL Offer was generous (as was the Second QPL
Offer), relative to the outcome achieved in the
proceedings, and these offers
afforded the plaintiff sufficient time to consider whether to accept or reject
the proposal. The offers
were also made at points in time in the proceedings at
which the plaintiff was fairly able to assess its position in the litigation.
The offers alerted the recipient to the costs consequences which might follow,
as well. That said, these matters are significantly
outweighed by the following
considerations, concerning the lack of clarity in the offers and the inclusion
of extraneous matters.
, the terms of the offers lacked clarity. In particular, the
offers were subject to further negotiation by the parties to agree the
a settlement deed, with no terms for that deed being proposed, other than full
releases, the payment terms, and the resolution
of the Company Proceeding. This
has a direct impact on the analysis as to whether the rejection of the offers
was unreasonable or
the factual setting before the Victorian Court of Appeal in
Sim Development
there are no objective indicia in the present case which might lead the court to
conclude that the parties would have readily negotiated
the requisite terms.
my view, it is highly relevant to the analysis of reasonableness that the First
QPL Offer was not certain, was not capable of
immediate acceptance, and was
subject to further negotiation between the parties.
it is a significant feature of the offers that they drew in matters
beyond the scope of the issues in the Company Proceeding, which
properly have been the subject of
orders following any judgment in the action. The terms of the offers were not
confined to the
issues raised in the proceedings.
The offers, if accepted, would have required Moyle Holdings to provide
full releases in relation to the services which had been provided
Holdings by QPL, which had served as its accounting firm for a lengthy period of
time. The language of the offers squarely
demonstrates the intended scope as
travelling beyond the extant proceedings. The offers proposed that there would
be 'full releases
between our respective clients in relation to the services
provided by our client to your client and the Action' and stated the settlement
...in full and final settlement of all claims arising directly or indirectly out
of, or in any way connected to the services provided
by our client to your
client, including (but not limited to) the matters raised in the
Within the proceedings, the plaintiff rightly observes that QPL would be
entitled to its costs in the event the court found in its
favour, and QPL would
also have had the benefit of a
precluding the claims being reagitated thereafter. But QPL
could not have obtained relief from the court at the conclusion of the
proceedings by which Moyle Holdings released it from all liability it might have
including in respect of matters not the subject
of the proceedings.
I am thus unable to conclude in the circumstances that the non-acceptance of
either offer made by QPL was unreasonable, or that
Moyle Holdings would have
been better off if it had accepted the offer, relative to the dismissal of the
claims, as has now transpired.
That is largely because the offers required
Moyle Holdings, in return for accepting the payment of $75,000 or $100,000 (as
respectively
proposed in the First QPL Offer and the Second QPL Offer), to
release QPL from all other claims which Moyle Holdings might have,
which had not
yet been litigated, and which were not the subject of these proceedings.
The offers made by QPL might strike one as being entirely sensible from a
commercial perspective, there being an evident desirability
to 'wrap-up' all
claims between the parties as part of such a settlement. However, the breadth
of the offers renders the unreasonableness
analysis more than problematic in the
circumstances of this case.
the foregoing reasons, I consider the discretion of the court should be
exercised to refuse the application for indemnity costs
in favour of QPL. The
costs order will be confined to party and party
. I will ask the solicitors
for the parties to provide a minute of the costs orders to be made to give
effect to these reasons, including
the orders required for the release of
amounts paid into court by the plaintiff as
certify that the preceding paragraph(s) comprise the reasons for decision of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia.
