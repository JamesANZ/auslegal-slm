REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 5 August 2021)
[1] This is a
reference to the Full Court pursuant to
Supreme Court Act
(NT). The sole issue for determination is whether legislation
purporting to validate a decision by the defendant to refuse a request
plaintiff to amend the NT Planning Scheme directs the Supreme Court in the
exercise of its jurisdiction in a manner prohibited
by the principles identified
Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)
[2] In 2014, the
plaintiff purchased Lots 6907 and 6908 Town of Darwin (“the Land”).
The Land was zoned as Community
Purpose under the NT Planning Scheme. The
purpose of that zone at the time of purchase was expressed to be to
“[p]rovide for
community services and facilities, whether publicly or
privately owned or operated, including facilities for civic and government
administration”.
[3] In December
2017, the plaintiff requested the defendant to amend the NT Planning Scheme to
rezone the Land from Community Purpose
to a Specific Use zone pursuant to
Planning Act 1999
(NT) (“the Act”). A
revised rezoning application was submitted on 11 August 2019. The intended
effect of the request
was to facilitate high and medium density residential
development on the Land.
exhibiting the proposal and holding a public hearing, the defendant refused the
request to rezone the land by letter to
the plaintiff dated 27 July 2020.
September 2020, the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of the
Northern Territory challenging the validity
of the defendant’s decision.
The Originating Motion sought an order in the nature of
quashing the defendant’s decision on a number of grounds, including:
(a) that the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of
of the Act to provide reasons for the
(b) that the defendant took into account irrelevant considerations; and
(c) that the defendant failed to take into account (or gave insufficient weight
to) relevant matters, particularly the 2020 Traffic
Impact Statement and the
Darwin Inner Suburbs Area Plan.
[6] In order to
succeed in the claim, the plaintiff was required to establish in accordance with
administrative law principles that
the defendant’s decision was invalid on
one or more of the grounds specified in the Originating Motion. The
commencement of
the proceedings invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to
determine that matter.
February 2021, the executive government introduced the
Planning Amendment Bill
(NT) (“the Bill”) into the Legislative Assembly. The Bill
received assent on 10 March 2021 and commenced on 11 March
2021. The Bill
did the following three things.
(a) It inserted s 13(7)into the Act, to provide
A failure by the Minister to comply with subsection (4)(b) or (6) does not
affect the validity of the Minister’s decision.
(b) It inserted s 29(2) into the Act, to provide:
A failure by the Minister to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the
validity of the Minister’s decision.
(c) It inserted s 148A into the Act, to provide:
148A Validity of Decision
(1) This section applies in relation to the Minister’s decision to
refuse a request to amend the NT Planning Scheme to change
the zones of Lots
6907 and 6908 Town of Darwin, notice of which decision is dated 27 July
(2) Despite any law to the contrary, the decision is valid, and is taken to
have been valid on and from the date it was made.
[8] It is clear
from its terms that
Planning Act
is directed
specifically to the defendant’s decision to refuse the request to amend
the NT Planning Scheme in relation to Land.
Not only is that the objective
intention of the provision properly construed, it was also the subjective
intention of the defendant,
the executive government and the legislature both to
validate the decision and to defeat the proceedings brought by the plaintiff
the Supreme Court. On the day the Bill was introduced into the Legislative
Assembly, the defendant issued a media release which
stated that a “key
feature” of the Bill was:

the decision by the Minister to refuse a request to rezone the land at 16 and 25
Blake Street,
The Gardens (Lots 6907 and 6908, Town of Darwin) from community
purposes to a special use zone that would have facilitated high and
density residential development, which does not fit with the existing character
of The Gardens.
[9] Similarly,
in the Second Reading Speech made on that same day, the defendant
The bill includes a provision that puts beyond doubt the
validity of the decision made by myself in regard to the land located at
25 Blake Street, The Gardens, Lots 6907 and 6908, Town of Darwin. This would,
for all practical purposes, conclude the current
Supreme Court proceedings. To
achieve this, the bill inserts a new section at 148A.

plaintiff pleaded that the provision was invalid and was not a bar to the

with or repugnant to, the institutional integrity
of the court and its role
under Ch III of the
Constitution
as a repository of federal

implementation of the legislative or executive policies of the
Territory concerned;
(b) the legislation requires the court to depart to a significant degree from
the methods and standards which have historically characterised
the exercise of
judicial power.
gravamen of the plaintiff’s challenge is that s 148A of the Act is
directed specifically to the proceedings it has
brought for judicial review of
the defendant’s decision, and thereby prejudges the subject matter of
those proceedings and
requires the Supreme Court to exercise its jurisdiction
accordingly. The argument follows that on proper characterisation, the
legislation
amounts to a direction to the Court as to the outcome of the
proceedings, and is thus an impermissible intrusion into the judicial

Court has previously had occasion to consider the constitutional validity of
validating legislation in the
context, most recently in

, the High Court observed that there can be no objection to the
validity of a statute which is “simply a retrospective validation
administrative act”.
Such a statute “does no more than attribute the consequences of legal
validity” to past acts.
In addition, the mere fact that the statute in question was passed during the
currency of pending litigation does not, of itself,
render the legislative
provision unconstitutional as an impairment of the Court’s institutional
integrity. In support of that
proposition, the plurality

Honour then was) had said in an earlier case concerning an asserted interference
with the judicial process:

express or implied, that rights in issue in legal proceedings shall not be the

be applied by a court in
the determination of pending and future proceedings, and legislation which
permissibly effects a retrospective

that the legislation under consideration in
was distinguished from
the legislation which had been declared invalid in
International Finance
Trust Co Ltd v New South Wales Crime
. That latter
legislation required a court not only to receive an
application,
but also to hear and determine it
in a statutorily mandated
departure from procedural fairness. It was in that context that the Court in
spoke of legislation which purported “to give a direction to
a court to treat as valid that which the legislature has left
The requirement
to proceed in that fashion constituted an impermissible direction to the court
as to the manner in which it exercised
its jurisdiction, and deprived the court
of an important characteristic of judicial
validity of s 148A
[20] In reliance
on those principles, the defendant contends that s 148A does nothing more
than retrospectively (and expressly) validate
the decision of the Minister made
in relation to the Land. It does not confer any power or function upon a court
nor deprive it
of one, and it requires only that the alteration of the
substantive law be applied in accordance with the ordinary curial
[21] On the
other hand, the plaintiff contends that a nuanced approach should be taken to
the question of the validity or invalidity
of s 148A, relying on the
statement of Gummow, Hayne and Bell JJ in
AEU v Fair Work
that “it is
very much to be doubted that any single, all-embracing proposition could be
devised which would mark off statutes
which are beyond power – because the
statute impermissibly interferes with the exercise of the judicial power –
those which are not”. Their Honours then went on to
At least in cases which are still pending in the judicial
system, it will be important to consider whether or to what extent the impugned
law amounts to a legislative direction about how specific litigation should be
decided. That is, as one author has written, a balance
must be struck between
the recognition that the Parliament may change the law in a way that has an
effect on pending proceedings
(a proposition that has been described as
“the changed law rule”) and the recognition that the Parliament
cannot direct
the courts as to the conclusions they should reach in the exercise
of their jurisdiction (a proposition that has been described as
direction principle”).
[22] Although
that case was concerned with the judicial power of the Commonwealth and the
separation of powers at federal level, the
plaintiff contends that legislation
which infringes “the direction principle” must also attract the
application of
principles. In the plaintiff’s submission,
s 148A of the Act purports to direct the courts as to the manner and
the exercise of their jurisdiction. The effect – and the only
effect – of s 148A is to remove the supervisory jurisdiction
Supreme Court in relation to a single administrative decision, the validity of
which is the sole question to be determined
in the pending proceedings for
judicial review. The function of the Supreme Court in determining that
application would ordinarily
be to assess whether the Minister has validly
complied with criteria set out in ss 13 and 29 of the Act. It is said that
abrogates this process and effectively dictates the result to the
Court. In making that submission, counsel for the plaintiff sought
number of points of distinction between the present matter and the operation of
the validating legislation considered in
and the earlier
authorities.
[23] First, a
distinction was drawn between the operation of s 148A and the provision
under consideration in
, although there was
litigation on foot the outcome of which would effectively be determined by the
impugned legislation, and the
legislation was concerned to address one problem,
the legislation itself was in general terms and did not merely prescribe the
of the pending proceedings. By analogy with the legislation under
consideration in
, a contrast was drawn between s 148A and a
hypothetical legislative provision which provided that any decision made by the
before 28 July 2020 shall be taken to be valid notwithstanding an
insufficiency of reasons. In the plaintiff’s submission,
a provision in
those more general terms would have satisfied the test of validity.
[24] Secondly, a
distinction was sought to be made between the operation of s 148A and the
legislation under challenge in
. Attention was drawn to the
following passage in support of the proposition that the validating legislation
there was not directed
to the pending proceedings, and in fact could not have
been if it was to achieve the purpose of the legislature:
plaintiff's legal proceedings are not mentioned in the Act. The manifest purpose
and effect of the Act is to establish a legal
regime affecting the Morayfield
shopping centre land, binding the developer, the Council, and all other persons
including the plaintiff.
Indeed, assuming that the ultimate objective of the
Government was to bring about the result that the Morayfield shopping centre
could lawfully be constructed as expeditiously as possible, it would not have
been sufficient to enact legislation which merely addressed
the plaintiff's
legal proceedings. In order to achieve the desired result, it was necessary to
enact legislation binding all those
who might possibly be concerned, in the
future, with the proposed development and all those who might avail themselves
of the broad
standing provision in respect of "a person" provided by s 4.3(8) of
Planning and Environment Act
The same consideration answers the plaintiff's argument that this was
legislation
. An examination of the terms of the Act reveals
that this is not so, and the objective attributed to Parliament by the plaintiff
is such that it could not be so. Legislation
would not have
achieved that objective. It was not enough to deal with the plaintiff's legal
proceedings. It was necessary to ensure
that the proposed development was
reference to
legislation is said by the plaintiff to reflect
the generally accepted proposition that legislation will amount to a usurpation
or impermissible interference with, judicial power if it prejudges an issue
with respect to a particular individual and requires
a court to exercise its
function accordingly, brings down a “legislative judgment” directed
against specific individuals,
or directs the courts as to the manner and outcome
of their jurisdiction.
[26] Thirdly, a
distinction was drawn between the operation of s 148A and the legislation
which was challenged in
Australian Building Construction Employees’ and
Builders Labourers’ Federation v The
Commonwealth
matter the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had declared that the
Builders Labourers’ Federation had contravened
certain agreements. The
effect of the declaration was to empower the responsible Minister to deregister
the union. The union then
commenced proceedings for judicial review of the
Commission’s decision, and an order prohibiting the Minister from
its registration. Those proceedings were listed to be heard before
the High Court on 6 May 1986. On 14 April 1986 the Parliament
legislation which cancelled the registration of the union, thereby making
redundant the legal proceedings which the union
had commenced.
[27] In the
plaintiff’s submission, there are material differences between that form
of legislation and s 148A of the Act.
Rather than simply validating the
defendant’s decision, s 148A goes on to provide that the decision
“is taken to have
been valid on and from the date it was made”. The
provision was said thereby to be cast in terms that amount to a command
Supreme Court as to the conclusion that it is to reach in the issues which
present in the application for judicial review,
and that are more accurately
characterised as directive rather than
substantive.
That submission
picks up what was said by Street CJ in
Building Construction Employees &
Builders’ Labourers Federation (NSW) v Minister for Industrial
concerning New
South Wales legislation which provided that a certificate given by the
responsible Minister under New South Wales
legislation as a precondition to the
cancellation of the union’s registration:
... shall (to the
extent, if any, that that action was invalid) be treated, for all purposes, as
having been valid, and the certificate
shall correspondingly be treated, for all
purposes, as having been validly given from the time it was given or purportedly
challenge to that legislation was considered by the New South Wales Court of
Appeal at a time before
had been decided. The Court’s
consideration proceeded necessarily on the basis that there was no separation of
powers doctrine
operating at State level, with the result that the legislation
was found to be valid despite an acceptance by at least some members
Court that it constituted an exercise of judicial power because it directed the
outcome of pending litigation. The plaintiff
says legislation of that character
and circumstance would now attract the application of
principles on
the basis that: (a) there was a proceeding before a court of competent
administrative act in question; (b)
the legislation was directed to a particular legal person and the incidents of
that particular
litigation; and (c) rather than substantively validating the
administrative act, the legislation directed a conclusion. The plaintiff
further that those same characteristics and circumstances are present in the
legislation here under consideration.
[29] Although it
may be accepted that legislation which directs a court to reach a particular
conclusion would ordinarily infringe
principles, on proper
characterisation s 148A is not a direction to the Supreme Court as to how
to determine the issues in this proceeding.
It does not direct or conscript the
Supreme Court to treat as valid that which the legislature has left invalid.
Its effect, rather,
is to validate retrospectively the Minister’s
decision. That is to say, it is a retrospective validation of an administrative
act which thereby affects substantive rights. It states expressly, and in the
clear exercise of legislative rather than judicial
authority, that
“[d]espite any law to the contrary, the decision is valid”. The
subsequent provision that the decision
“is taken to have been valid on and
from the date it was made” is ancillary to that validation, and a
direction to the
Court only in the sense that it clarifies and puts beyond doubt
that the legislative validation is retrospective in its operation.
[30] The fact
that the defendant’s decision was validated by legislation at a time when
there were already proceedings on foot
challenging the decision, and that the
validation is determinative of those proceedings, does not mean that the Supreme
been unlawfully enlisted or conscripted to the purpose of the
executive or legislature.
The notion of
conscription in Australian law is borrowed in part from
Mistretta v United
, in which the United
States Supreme Court observed (at 407) that the judicial branch’s
reputation for impartiality and non-partisanship
may not be borrowed by the
political branches “to cloak their work in the neutral colours of judicial
[31] In order
for a court to be impermissibly conscripted there must be some form of passing
off of a legislative or executive decision,
or desire to bring about a
particular outcome, as an exercise of the judicial power of a court in a manner
inconsistent with the
proper relationship between the arms of
government.
So far as is
relevant for these purposes, the proper operation of that relationship requires
that the courts independently and impartially
interpret and apply statutes in
the determination of controversies between parties. For legislation to
unlawfully impair that relationship
in the constitutional sense there must be
some signal feature in its operation, such as a frank direction incompatible
with the judicial
process, the utilisation of confidence in the impartial and
public decision-making of judicial officers to support inscrutable
decision-making
incorporation at the behest of the executive of unstated premises into a
judicial determination
legislation under consideration here expressly validates the defendant’s
decision, and even if the plaintiff’s
challenge to that decision is
pursued to an ultimate determination in the Supreme Court, the reasons
underlying that determination
will be patent.
[32] Nor is it
sufficient to engage the
principle that the judiciary, in the
declaration and enforcement of legislation, gives effect to government policy
formulated, or
even dictated, by the executive. All judicial enforcement of
legislation enacted substantially in conformity with a Bill presented
legislature by the executive will have that
In many cases, the
legislation in question will be the outcome of political controversy, or reflect
controversial political determinations;
but administering and giving effect to
such legislation does not compromise the integrity of a court simply by reason
of the fact
that the result is the outcome of political action or in conformance
with a legislative or executive
[33] It can
readily be accepted that when analysing for
purposes the manner in
which the legislative or executive object is achieved, legislation directed to
specific individuals or to
identified proceedings must be subjected to careful
scrutiny to ensure the court is not impermissibly directed or conscripted to
achievement of that object. One of the salient features of the impugned
legislation in
was that it was expressly directed to the continued
detention of a named individual and no other
However, the fact that
legislation may have application limited to particular individuals or
proceedings, or to an identified but
limited class thereof, is not in itself
determinative of validity. That characteristic did not deny the validity of the
legislation in
Baker v The
, notwithstanding that
in the Second Reading Speech the responsible Minister identified by name the 10
prisoners to whom the legislation
. The plurality in
noted that the application of the impugned legislation to a small
class of persons, or a single individual, will give rise to issues
constitutional validity where the legislation is properly characterised as
in accordance with the invalidating principle expressed in
Liyanage v The Queen
That process of characterisation requires a consideration of the subject matter
and context of the legislation.
[34] The subject
matter of the impugned legislation may be important in determining whether that
legislation constitutes an impermissible
interference with the judicial process
by reason of the narrowness of its application. In particular, a distinction is
drawn between powers that are exclusively judicial in nature (eg
determining the guilt or otherwise of a defendant in a criminal
matter), and
matters which the legislature may choose to have determined either by a judicial
or non-judicial body (eg planning matters).
As the Court observed in
, a statute affecting litigation with respect to criminal guilt
and punitive detention will involve quite different considerations
affecting litigation concerning rights amenable to administrative
determination.
Of course, in
that respect s 148A of the Act bears no resemblance at all to the
provisions of the Acts which were held invalid in
[35] So far as
context is concerned, it is plain from the media release and Second Reading
Speech extracted above that the defendant
expected and intended that the
enactment of the legislation would, for all practical purposes, conclude the
Supreme Court proceedings.
However, whether legislation constitutes an
impermissible interference with the judicial process does not depend upon the
or intentions of the Minister or of individual members of the
legislature. The determination of validity depends upon the nature
rights which the statute changes, regulates or
It should be noted
in that respect that McHugh J’s observations in
usurpation of judicial power by “legislative judgment” require not
only a legislative interference which affects
specific and pending litigation,
but also that the interference affects the judicial process itself in the sense
that it abrogates
the discretion or judgement of the judiciary or the rights,
authority or jurisdiction of the court.
[36] As already
described, s 148A of the Act validates the defendant’s decision by
way of a legislative statement affecting
or declaring substantive rights to be
applied in accordance with the ordinary curial processes. The terms of the
legislation do
not suggest the court has determined the validity of the
defendant’s decision in the exercise of judicial discretion. It is
clearly and expressly a legislative validation. There is nothing in the
legislation requiring the Supreme Court to act otherwise
than in accordance with
the principles and procedures according to which it ordinarily exercises
judicial power.
The legislation
does not remove or affect any of the ordinary judicial processes by which the
Supreme Court performs its judicial
In determining the
application for judicial review the Supreme Court would be undertaking an
orthodox and conventional judicial
involving the
adjudication of rights and liabilities established by
Although the effect of
the provision is that the application for judicial review of the
defendant’s decision, if prosecuted
to a determination, would be resolved
in favour of the defendant, s 148A does not constitute a direction to the
Supreme Court as
to how to determine the proceeding. It is directed to the
[37] During the
course of both written and oral submissions, counsel for the plaintiff invoked
the principle expressed in
Kirk v Industrial Court of New South
in aid of the
submission that s 148A of the Act constituted an impermissible interference
with the ordinary judicial processes, on
the basis that it would effectively
deprive the Supreme Court of power to grant relief on account of jurisdictional
error. In framing
the submission, counsel made it clear that the plaintiff was
not seeking to argue that the principle expressed in
had application
to the Northern Territory’s constitutional arrangements. The submission
was only that, by way of analogy, legislation
which removed that jurisdiction
would impair the Court’s institutional integrity in the application of
principles. That submission must be rejected on the ground that
s 148A does not have privative operation in the relevant sense,
and effects
no diminution of or restriction on the Court’s jurisdiction. It is not
directed to the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court in either pending or future
proceedings, but rather to the validity of the Minister’s decision. As
stated above, the
constitutional character of the provision will turn on the
nature of the rights which the statute changes.
[38] In that
assessment, there is no material point of distinction between the present

the point that Chapter III contains no prohibition that rights in issue in a

It is otherwise when the legislation in question interferes
with the judicial process itself, rather than with the substantive rights

Liyanage v The Queen
(1967) 1 AC 259 was
such a case where the legislation attempted to circumscribe the judicial process
on the trial of particular prisoners
charged with particular offences on a
particular occasion and to affect the way in which judicial discretion as to
sentence was to
be exercised so as to enhance the punishment of those
Here the situation is very different. The Cancellation of Registration Act
does not deal with any aspect of the judicial process.
It simply deregisters
the Federation, thereby making redundant the legal proceedings which it
commenced in this Court. It matters
not that the motive or purpose of the
Minister, the Government and the Parliament in enacting the statute was to
circumvent the proceedings
and forestall any decision which might be given in
those proceedings.

The specified date was the date
of the High Court's decision in
Independent Commission Against Corruption v
(2015) 256 CLR 1. The High Court in
had determined
that “corrupt conduct” in s 8 of the
include conduct that adversely affects or could adversely affect the efficacy,
but not the probity, of the exercise of official
functions. This meant that the
ICAC report in relation to the plaintiff was beyond power, a matter sought to be
established by the
plaintiff. The NSW legislature enacted legislation which
provided: “Anything done or purporting to be done by the Commission
would have been validly done if corrupt conduct for the purposes of this Act
included relevant conduct is taken to have been,
and always to have been,
validly done.” “Relevant conduct” was defined as
“conduct that would be corrupt
conduct for the purposes of this Act if the
reference in section 8(2) to conduct that adversely affects, or could adversely
the exercise of official conduct included conduct that adversely
affects, or could adversely affect, the efficacy (but not the probity)
exercise of official functions.”

individuals imprisoned in respect of an attempted coup, to widen the class of
cases that could be tried without
jury, to retrospectively validate arrests and
to prescribe new minimum penalties for the offence of waging war against the
were invalid as “a grave and deliberate incursion into the judicial
sphere” which was inconsistent with the separation
of powers required by
the constitution of Ceylon.

privative clause stating that a decision of the Industrial Court "is final and
may not be appealed against, reviewed, quashed
or called into question by any
court or tribunal", extending to proceedings for any relief or remedy, whether
by order in the nature
of prohibition, certiorari or mandamus, injunctions,
declaration or otherwise. The High Court’s decision that this legislative
provision was invalid depended upon the fact that Chapter III of the
Constitution
requires that there be a body fitting the description "the
Supreme Court of a State" so that it is beyond the legislative power of
so to alter the constitution or character of its Supreme Court that it ceases to
meet the constitutional description. As
there is no reference in the
Constitution
to the Supreme Court of a self-governing territory, there
may be some doubt as to the applicability of the principle in
Northern Territory. Given the manner in which the plaintiff framed its
argument, it is unnecessary to resolve that matter
for present purposes.
