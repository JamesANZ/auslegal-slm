REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
substantive proceedings concern parenting and financial matters between the
first respondent (“the wife”) and the
second respondent (“the
husband”). On 10 July 2025, a Judge of the Federal Circuit and Family
Court of Australia (Division
1) ordered the sale of a property, namely, [Lots 1
and 2, D Street], and for a sum of $50,000 to be paid to the wife by way of
property settlement.
hours of the 10 July 2025 order, the husband lodged a caveat on [Lot 1]
necessitating an application by the wife to have it
removed and to restrain the
husband from doing so again. Shortly before the hearing of the wife’s
application on 28 July 2025,
the husband removed the caveat.
29 July 2025, a third party, Ms Kostić, lodged a caveat over [Lot 1]
necessitating a further application by the wife. On 6
August 2025, Ms
Kostić was ordered to remove the caveat, not to relodge a caveat, and not
to assist any other person in lodging
a caveat. Ms Kostić has appealed
against that order.
appeal is listed for hearing on 18 November 2025.
are only two active parties in the appeal, namely, Ms Kostić (“the
appellant”) and the husband as a respondent.
The appellant and the husband
are known to each other with the appellant contending she has known the husband
since January 2025.
The wife and the Independent Children’s Lawyer have
each filed Submitting Notices in the appeal.
APPLICATION FOR DETERMINATION
30 October 2025, an Appeal Judicial Registrar dismissed an Application in an
Appeal filed by the appellant on 20 October 2025 (“the
application”) and a Response to the original application filed by the
husband on 27 October 2025.
is apparent on the face of the Application in an Appeal filed by the appellant
on 7 November 2025 that the appellant seeks a review
of the Appeal Judicial
Registrar’s order made on 30 October 2025 (“the application for
review”). The application
for review is sought to be determined in
Chambers in the absence of the parties (r 13.38 of the
Federal Circuit and
Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021
(Cth) (“the

appropriate date.

, Division 13.7.2. Chapter 13 specifically applies to appeals.
determination of the application for review in the absence of the parties is
permitted by r 13.38(2)(a) of the rules. The consent
of the parties is not
Chapter 13 of the rules is silent as to the procedure on review of an Appeal
Judicial Registrar’s order or rejection
of a document.
14 of the rules is headed - “Registrars and delegated powers” and
of Chapter 14 applies to an application for review of
an exercise
by a Senior Judicial Registrar or Judicial Registrar but
“does not apply to an application for a review of an order by an Appeal
Judicial Registrar” (r 14.04(b)).
to the procedure for review of an exercise of power by a Senior Judicial
Registrar or Judicial Registrar, r 14.07 provides as follows:
(1) A court must hear an application for review of an exercise of power by
a Senior Judicial Registrar or Judicial Registrar as
an original hearing.
Note: In an original hearing, the court rehears the whole matter and does
not simply review the decision of the original court.
(2) The court may receive as evidence:
(a) any affidavit or exhibit tendered in the first hearing; or
(b) with the leave of the court, any further affidavit or exhibit;
(c) the transcript (if any) of the first hearing; or
(d) if a transcript is not available—an affidavit about the
evidence that was adduced at the first hearing, sworn by a person
present at the first hearing.
(3) The court may determine an application for review in the absence of
the parties without an oral hearing if:
(a) the parties to the application consent to the making of the decision
in their absence without an oral hearing; and
(b) the court considers it appropriate to make the decision in the absence
of the parties without an oral hearing.
the absence of any submissions on the point, it seems to me to be appropriate to
adopt a procedure for review that is most favourable
to the appellant i.e. as an
original hearing. In that regard, I receive as evidence not only the
appellant’s affidavit filed
20 October 2025 but also her further affidavit
filed 7 November 2025.
24 September 2025, an Appeal Judicial Registrar communicated by email to the
parties as follows:
Dear parties,
This appeal is listed to proceed before the Full Court, sitting in [redacted] on
[redacted].
I refer to emails sent to the National Appeals Registry in Melbourne on 24
September 2025, from the second respondent at 2:45pm (Melbourne
time) and from
the appellant at 3:20pm (Melbourne time).
The appeal book index was revised with the parties’ consent, as expressed
in their various emails to the court on Sunday, 14
September 2025, each of which
was deemed received by the National Appeal Registry Melbourne on Monday, 15
September 2025. On the
basis of the parties’ consent and in view of the
strictures of
rules 13.20
Federal Circuit and Family Court
of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021
, a chambers order was made on 17
September 2025 to expand the
list of documents contained within the appeal book. This prospect was
foreshadowed in the email sent
to the parties by the National Appeal Registry at
11:44am on 8 September 2025. The revised index is annexed to the orders made on
17 [sic] September 2025. The orders including the annexed revised index were
made available to the parties on the portal, and by
email sent to the parties at
12:59pm (Melbourne time) on that day, namely 17 September 2025.
The appeal book now contains the affidavit material relied upon by the parties
at the hearing before the primary Judge which occurred
on 6 August 2025,
a. Affidavit of [the wife] filed 31 July 2025;
b. Affidavit of [the husband] filed 5 August 2025;
c. Affidavit of [the appellant] filed 5 August 2025; and
d. [The appellant’s] Amended response filed in court on 6 August 2025.
The revised index and the digital appeal book now includes those agreed
documents at items 13, 15, 16 and 17 of the revised index.
The inclusion of
these documents does not offend the Court’s Rules.
The Amended Notice of Appeal filed 1 September 2025 and Second Amended Notice of
Appeal filed 15 September 2025 have been filed,
as the Commonwealth Courts
Portal clearly demonstrates, and the parties can be assured that the Full Court
has been made aware of
the documents. The Amended Notice of Appeal filed 15
September 2025 supersedes those filed before it. The Amended Notices are not
included in the appeal book
and need not be.
The appeal book is settled and now complies with
Rules 13.20
court’s Rules are clear on proper inclusions in the appeal book and you
are encouraged to refer to those rules.
The administration of this appeal remains with the Southern Appeal Registry at
email provided information to the parties in the appeal. It was not an
. As there was no order made by the Appeal Judicial Registrar on 24
September 2025, it renders the relief sought in paragraphs 1–3
original application and the relief sought in paragraphs 2–4 of the
application for review otiose.
to the amendments sought to be made to the appeal book: the appellant, in the
original application (by reference to her affidavit
filed 20 October 2025),
refers to a revised index annexed to an order made on 15 September 2025 which I
note is different to the
revised index at the front of the 290-page appeal book
which includes 18 numbered documents. In the original application, the appellant
sought the following amendments to the appeal book:
(a) The deletion of the order made by Kari J on 18 August 2025 (a procedural
order) and reasons for same (the reasons are not included
in the appeal
(b) The inclusion of:
(i) The submitting notices filed by other parties;
(ii) “Exhibit #1H6 August 2025 H2 Response to email, admission documented
at 32[5] of the Transcript”;
(iii) The amended Notices of Appeal;
(iv) “Given the Appealed judgment refers to three other judgements stating
they should be read with the Appealed Judgment ...
that Affidavits provided in
the proceedings be included in the Appeal Book where those other judgments does
[sic] not adequately
consider those Affidavits in its deliberations but makes
comments about the factual scenario which these sought [sic] affidavits
relevant to” ;
(v) The husband’s affidavit filed on 2 May 2025;
(vi) The husband’s affidavit filed on 23 May 2025 which
“contained” an affidavit of the husband “affirmed”
(vii) The husband’s affidavit filed on 25 July 2025;
(viii) The husband’s affidavit filed on 28 July 2025.
the application for review, the appellant seeks that the appeal book “be
amended as detailed in the Application in an Appeal
dated 20 October 2025 [and]
written submission of the [appellant] dated 28 October 2025” (as per
original). In her written
submissions, the appellant states:
the Appealed Judgement explicitly states that it should be read with three other
judgments then evidence adduced in those other
hearings engendering each of
those judgments should be adduced if the evidence had not been adequately
considered in those judgments
and are therefore important to provide the
necessary background context.
21. Those affidavits have been listed in the Affidavit of the [appellant].
(Footnote omitted)
affidavit referred to in paragraph 21 of the appellant’s written
submissions is the appellant’s affidavit filed on
20 October 2025 and the
footnote to paragraph 21 indicates that reliance is placed on paragraphs
32–36 of that affidavit. The
affidavits referred to therein are those
identified in paragraph 19(b)(v)–(viii) in these reasons.
to r 13.20 of the rules, unless otherwise ordered, the appeal book must contain
(a) the documents put in evidence at the hearing or trial to which the
appeal relates, including the orders, applications, affidavits
and exhibits
relevant to the grounds of appeal or contention and necessary to enable the
court hearing the appeal to reach its decision;
(b) if the appeal involves a challenge to the exclusion of
evidence—the document:
(i) that is the subject of the challenge; and
(ii) that was tendered, but not admitted as evidence, at the hearing or
trial to which the appeal relates.
must be remembered that the appeal relates solely to the order made on 6 August
2025 (the removal of the caveat) not to the order
made on 10 July 2025 (sale of
[Lots 1 and 2]).
notices and amended Notices of Appeal do not fall into any category identified
in r 13.20 although the original Notice
of Appeal is included in the appeal book
(as it is in this appeal). The third amended Notice of Appeal filed on 29
September 2025
will be before the Full Court when this appeal is heard.
exhibit referred to in paragraph 19(b)(ii) of these reasons is an email from the
husband to the wife’s solicitor dated 5
August 2025, responding to an
allegation relating to the administration of a superannuation fund. The
appellant has not demonstrated
how the document is necessary to enable the court
hearing the appeal to reach its decision.

appeal book. The appellant has not identified how any

affidavits are necessary to enable the court hearing the appeal to reach its

Judicial Registrar from performing their administrative
appeal duties.
relation to any deficiency with the appellant’s summary of argument, the
appellant may seek leave from the Full Court at
the hearing of her appeal to
advance any issues not identified in her summary of argument filed on 29
September 2025 (r 13.23(4)
of the rules).
DISPOSITION
application for review will be dismissed.
I certify that the preceding twenty-nine (29)
numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment of the
Honourable Justice
Dated: 11 November 2025
The appellant annexes at page
21 of her affidavit filed 20 October 2025 an email from the registrar noting
that the reference to
17 September should have been a reference to 15 September.
