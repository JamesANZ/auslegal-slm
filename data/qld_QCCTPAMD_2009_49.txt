REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
1 May 2009 the Chief Executive Department of Employment, Economic Development
and Innovation (“the Chief Executive”)
filed an application in the
registry for a proceeding to be conducted to decide whether a disciplinary
ground against Isobel Florence
Walker (“the respondent”) is
established. Annexure “A” to the application sets out the charges
against the
respondent and the particulars of those charges. The charges allege
breach by the respondent of
sections 379(a)
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
, (“the Act”) and
section 11(1) of the
Real Estate Agency Practice Code of Conduct Regulation
the directions hearing on 23 September 2009 the respondent admitted disciplinary
charges 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. She informed the
tribunal that the only witness of
the applicant whom she required for cross examination was Joanne Cass.
5 October 2009 the respondent informed the registry that she did not intend to
appear at the final hearing today.
respondent did not attend the hearing today.
respondent held a real estate principal licence current from 8 January 2007
until 8 January 2009. She operated a business called
Gold Trim Realty
(“the business”) in partnership with Joanne Cass, who held a real
estate salesperson licence current
from 16 February 2007 until 16 February
Chief Executive commenced investigation of the respondent based on 2 separate
complaints it received from landlords who claimed
that the rental bond had not
been lodged with the
Residential Tenancies Authority
and the respondent had not paid them out.
Legislation
relevant sections of the Act are set out below.
“379 Dealing with amount on receipt
A licensee must, immediately on receiving the amount—
(a) pay it to the licensee’s general trust account; or
Example of paragraph (a)—
A licensee who collects an
amount of rent for a property owner
must pay the amount to the
licensee’s general trust account
before the money can be paid to
402 Time for audit
(2) The licensee must, within 4 months after the last day of
audit month in each year or the extended period allowed
the chief executive under subsection (3)—
have the licensee’s trust accounts for the last audit
period audited by the licensee’s auditor; and
the auditor’s signed original audit report with the
chief executive.
375 Notice before opening account
(1) Before opening a general trust account or special trust
account, a licensee must give the chief executive written
notice stating—
(a) the licensee’s intention to open the account;
(b) for a general trust account, the office or
branch of an
approved financial institution within the State where the
licensee proposes to open the account; and
(c) for a special
trust account, the office or branch of a
financial institution within
the State where the licensee
proposes to open the account;
(d) whether the account is to be a general trust account
special trust account.
164 Employment of persons in real estate business
(2) A principal licensee who is an individual and carries on
business of a real estate agent must not employ, as a
estate salesperson for the business, himself or herself
another individual with whom the principal licensee carries
business as a real estate agent.
11 Agent to keep client informed of developments
(1) A real estate agent appointed to sell, buy, exchange or lease
property for a client must keep the client informed of any
significant development or issue in relation to the
Applicant’s Evidence
Chief Executive relied upon the statements of Christine Matton, Joanne Cass,
Kenneth Landers, Kevin Williams, Shane Noy, Nicole
Simpson, John Simpson and
Rodney Page. Those statements were admitted into evidence as Exhibits 1 to 8
respectively.
Respondent’s evidence
28 August 2009 the respondent filed a statement in which she describes the
operation of the business. The respondent said that
the business ceased in
April 2008 by which time she was in poor health and could not cope mentally.
Applicant’s Submissions
9 October 2009 the applicant filed written submissions in which the applicant
seeks orders that the respondent be disqualified
from holding a licence under
the Act, a penalty in the range of $2,000.00 to $3,000.00, as well as costs in
the sum of $2755.00.
respondent has admitted disciplinary charges 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Proper
grounds therefore exist for taking disciplinary proceedings
against the
respondent for breach of the Act. Charges 1, 2 and 9 are to be determined.
Disciplinary
charge 9, namely that the respondent was employing as a real estate salesperson
a person with whom she, as principal
licensee carried on business, is proved by
the unchallenged evidence of Ms Cass.
Disciplinary
charges 1 and 2, which are in the alternative, do, as is submitted by the
applicant, rely on the cumulative effect of
charges 3 to 9 inclusive.
8 January 2007 when the respondent obtained her licence and April 2008, when
according to the respondent the business ceased,
she had committed numerous
legislative breaches. From the time of commencement and throughout the
respondent demonstrated unwillingness
or an inability to comply with the Act.
In the case of money received although the amounts involved were not large, her
to account for it is serious. Apart from legislative breach, there is
the failure to maintain standards in the real estate industry.
Importantly
these undermine public trust in the industry. There is a claim on the claim
fund as a consequence of the respondent’s
the totality of the evidence and absent the participation of the respondent, I
consider that disciplinary charge 1 is proved. The
applicant is not a suitable
person to hold a licence under the Act.
view of that finding, in the circumstances of this case, I do not propose to
impose a monetary penalty on the respondent.
Chief Executive is entitled to costs of the proceeding on the Magistrates Court
scale in the sum of $2,755.00.
respondent is disqualified permanently from holding a license or registration
certificate under
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
respondent will pay to the Chief Executive costs in the sum of $2,755.00 by,
4:00pm on 12 November 2009.
