Waters, Nigel --- "Privacy Act Reviews agree on changes needed" [2005] PrivLawPRpr 15; (2005) 11(7) Privacy Law and Policy Reporter 183
Nigel Waters
Case for change clear but environment not receptive
Two recent reviews of the federal Privacy Act are mutually supportive in
reaching similar conclusions on many issues and in making
plenty of suggestions
for improvements, although there is little sign of a government appetite for
changes, at least in the direction
of stronger privacy protection.
The Privacy Commissioner’s report in March 2005 of her review of the
private sector provisions of the Act
was followed in June by a
report by a Senate Committee into the wider operation of the entire
. The credibility of both reports is enhanced by the numerous
detailed submissions received – 136 to the Privacy Commissioner,
49 separate organisations to the Senate Committee.
The timing of the reports turns out to be unfortunate in that both reports
are now likely to be viewed by the government, and others,
through the prism of
a renewed emphasis on national security, following the London bombings in July,
as well as a new wave of initiatives
on government efficiency
is to be hoped that any proposals motivated by either security or efficiency
that involve greater intrusions into privacy are
‘road tested’
against the critiques in the two reports, and that the recommended safeguards
are adopted. It would also
be useful if the government could respond to the
reports in a reasonable timeframe, although precedents are not
encouraging
One common conclusion of both reports is that even the existing safeguards
are in danger of being more apparent than real in the absence
of adequate
resources, both for the ombudsman and watchdog roles of the Privacy Commissioner
and for attention within government
agencies to privacy issues and compliance
– for instance in the form of privacy impact assessments and internal
Cross party agreement
The Senate Committee report can be seen partly as a ‘last stand’
from concerned opposition and minor party senators, before
they lost the balance
of power in the Upper House. In the case of committee chair Nick Bolkus and
Democrat member Brian Greig, it
was literally a parting shot, as both retired
from the Senate in July after making significant contributions to the privacy
during their time. Senator Bolkus had a somewhat mixed record as both a
be particularly
remembered for his very personal role as Minister in adding the credit reporting
provisions to the Act in 1989.
But it is also significant that the report was unanimous and signals some
concern by members of the coalition parties about the risks
to privacy in the
current political environment. It is particularly noteworthy that the Committee
as a whole was unconvinced of
the need for the current broad exemptions –
specifically those for small businesses
and political acts and practices
Commissioner suggest many changes
In contrast to the wide-ranging scope of the Senate Inquiry, the Privacy
Commissioner’s review of the private sector provisions
was necessarily
constrained by the very limited terms of reference given to her by the
government.
The Commissioner’s overall conclusion that the private sector
provisions are ‘working well’ are disputed by the
Senate Committee,
although it generally supported most of the Commissioner’s detailed
recommendations for improvements and
calls for early implementation of
. How the Commissioner reached her overall conclusion is
something of a mystery, given that she acknowledges that the provisions
clearly failed to meet the objective of a single comprehensive national scheme,
does not fully meet international concerns and
obligations, and at least in the
eyes of consumer and privacy advocates does not adequately provide for the
Furthermore both the number (85) of
recommendations for action and the significance of some of them belie the
conclusion.
The Commissioner has clearly felt constrained not to directly challenge the
foundations of government policy on privacy – particularly
the emphasis on
light-touch co-regulation – despite considerable evidence that it is those
foundations that are unsound. However,
those who seek improvements in the level
of privacy protection should look beneath the Commissioner’s choice of
presumably designed not to upset the government and business
interests – to the many useful changes which she has clearly identified
These changes are generally either ones which consumer and privacy advocates
have called for, or where there is common ground between
them and businesses
subject to the Act. The overall impression from business submissions, reflected
in the report, is that compliance
with the National Privacy Principles has not
caused significant problems and that any burden stems from inconsistency,
uncertainty
and delays in complaint handling, all created by the exemptions and
by the lack of resources for the Commissioner’s office.
Wider review desirable
The Senate Committee’s call for a wider review, by the Australian Law
Reform Commission
, could be seen as a ‘buck-pass’ but
should perhaps be viewed more positively. Like the similar recommendation from
the Commissioner
, it reflects a recognition of the complexity of
the issues involved, particularly in light of technological developments, and of
the desirability of consistency both between jurisdictions and between
. Neither of the two review processes could realistically
have dealt with all of the issues, certainly within the timeframes available
Scope of the Act
Because of the limitations of her terms of reference, the Privacy
Commissioner’ only ventures into the area of scope is to recommend
regulation of residential tenancy databases
and of all small
telecommunications businesses
, and modification of the small
business exemption to use the ABS’s 20 employee threshold rather than
annual turnover
. As already noted, the Senate Committee, free of
the same constraints, recommends that many of the current exemptions be
Individuals’ control over personal information
Both reports discuss the differing viewpoints on the degree of control which
individuals have over the way in which personal information
is collected and
. At the heart of this issue is the phenomenon of
‘bundled consent’ where individuals are asked to agree to a package
of uses, not necessarily related or interdependent. The Commissioner can find
no easy solutions to reconcile a range of common business
practices which
involve bundling with the reasonable expectations of individuals. She commits
to working on further guidance
. However, her support for the
concept of short form notices
can be seen as moving in the opposite
direction, and this remains one of the most unsatisfactory aspects of the
operation of the
Application of the Act to new technologies – definition of
personal information
Both reports acknowledge the uncertainty about the application of the Privacy
Act arising from the definition of personal information.
Technologies such as
location dependent mobile phone services, and video surveillance (currently very
much in vogue!) offer the
potential for privacy intrusion without
identification. The Senate Committee has made a useful recommendation to apply
information that allows individuals to be contacted even though they
may not have first been identified
. Once again, the Senate
Committee has been more robust than the Commissioner, who merely discusses the
issue and flags it for a
wider review without any recommendation
The Commissioner’s report does however discuss a number of emerging
technology issues, including biometrics, electronic health
records and voice
over internet telephony, and suggests the use of binding codes as a way of
addressing these and other new challenges
for privacy
Outsourcing - Closing the loop on accountability
The Privacy Commissioner’s review identifies a weakness in the scheme
of the Act which leads to a loss of accountability once
handling of personal
information is contracted out by an organisation which is covered by the Act.
The Commissioner recommends amendment
of National Privacy Principle 4 to
expressly make the client agency responsible for ensuring protection of the
information in the
hands of the contractor (following the precedent in the
equivalent public sector Information Privacy Principle). Pending any such
amendment, the Commissioner will issue further guidance on the need to impose
contractual obligations. She also invites the government
to consider making a
distinction between data controllers and data operators.
Outsourcing highlights need for a single set of Principles
The Senate Committee noted the confusion and potential problems that arise
where a private sector contractor which is subject to the
NPPs takes on work
from a Commonwealth agency which seeks to impose the IPP standards
The Privacy Commissioner’s recommended solution to this is to move towards
a single set of principles for both private and
public sectors
Action needed on direct marketing
Both the Commissioner and the Senate Committee identify a need for greater
control for individuals over direct marketing, the Commissioner
limits herself
to recommending a general opt-out right, and consideration of a national
‘Do-not-contact Register
, while the Senate Committee goes
further in recommending a general opt-in right, consistent with the
Credit reporting – no change?
Attempts by the finance industry to question the current Privacy Act limits
on credit reporting appear to have backfired (although
their lobbying efforts
continue unabated).
As Part IIIA of the Act was it outside her terms of reference, the Privacy
Commissioner only mentions credit reporting where it comes
up in the context of
the other private sector provisions, and draws no conclusions. But the Senate
Committee addressed the issue
directly and could see no justification for the
introduction of (so-called) ‘positive credit reporting’. The
also rejected ‘positive reporting’ on the basis that it
could magnify problems associated with the current default reporting
Health information in urgent need of consistent regulation
The Senate Committee supported the Privacy Commissioner’s
recommendations aimed at achieving greater consistency and certainty
rules applying to health information, and specifically acknowledged concerns
Commissioner’s proposed solution to the current ‘muddle’ is
the early adoption by all jurisdictions of the
Australian Health Ministers
Council National Health Privacy Code
. This would also overcome
undesirable constraints on the transfer of health information between health
service providers and on
cessation of health businesses
Confusion in privacy regulation of Media and Communications
The Privacy Commissioner acknowledges the unsatisfactory duplication and
confusion in relation to telecommunications
, and recommends
legislative amendments and other practical changes to address this
. She also recommends and mandatory consultation by the
Broadcasting Regulator (now ACMA) and Media Bodies (such as the Press Council)
in developing Codes that deal with privacy in relation to the
. The Senate Committee acknowledges the variety of views on
regulation of the media
but does not draw any conclusions.
International Adequacy
The Senate Committee notes the continuing unresolved issue of
‘adequacy’ in relation to the European Union’s Data
Directive (and potentially in relation to the laws of other jurisdictions which
adopt a similar transborder data transfer
standards). While neither the
Committee nor the Privacy Commissioner found evidence of any significant
detriment to Australian business,
both call for measures to assist recognition
of Australian Privacy Laws by the EU.
The Commissioner also offers
support for the work of APEC privacy framework, which readers of PLPR will know
remains controversial
[see the update by the General Editor in this issue]. The
Senate Committee noted the divergence of views on the APEC work but came
Law Enforcement gains some ground?
In one of its few concessions to greater intrusions, the Senate Committee
invited the government to consider the Federal Police suggestion
‘notice to produce’ power for obtaining information from the private
sector, presumably when they do not have grounds
for a warrant
This goes beyond the Privacy Commissioner’s recommended approach that
further practical guidance should suffice
Misuse of Privacy law
The Senate Committee addressed the issue of the Privacy Act being used to
avoid accountability and transparency – often through
incorrect claims
that release of information is not possible ‘ because of the Privacy Act
(the BOTPA excuse). The Committee
supported the suggestion from the Australian
to be published at the expense of the organisation falsely claiming
the BOTPA excuse
Complaint handling
While the Commissioner’s main excuse for complaint handling weaknesses
is the lack of resources, she accepts some of the other
criticisms that have
been levied at the complaint handling provisions and processes, and undertakes
to consider using the determination
power earlier in cases which are not
susceptible to conciliation
, and to give more feedback on systemic
issues. She also recommends that the Act be amended to provide for merits
review of the
Commissioner’s decisions on complaints
at present only judicial review is possible.
However, she also recommends that she be given a discretion to discontinue
investigation of complaints where the harm to individuals
is minimal and there
is no public interest in pursuing the matter
. Given the track
record of successive Commissioners in using the existing grounds for not
investigating in a surprisingly large
number of cases, many critics would be
wary of making the Commissioner the sole arbiter of when a matter is in the
public interest.
Support for Privacy Impact Assessment
One of the most encouraging recommendations from the Senate Committee is the
call for a statutory privacy impact assessment (PIA)
process for significant new
. This recognises the limitation of the existing regime
in addressing, early in the policy process, the threshold issue of how much
monitoring surveillance is acceptable. The principles and complaint mechanisms
in the Act operate largely as ‘downstream’
safeguards once decisions
have been made on new systems and processes, but do not provide an opportunity
for public debate about
whether those systems and processes strike the right
balance between privacy rights and other public policy objectives. The Senate
Committee emphasises the importance of PIA processes being open and
transparent
. While PIA has most relevance to public sector
initiatives, it is interesting that the Senate Committee does not confine its
and recommendation to the public sector. The Privacy Commissioner
briefly raises the possibility of PIA being relevant to the private
sector, but
makes no recommendation
Resources and Powers
The Privacy Commissioner’s recommendations for increased
, while well argued, can of course be readily dismissed by
those opposed to effective regulation as self interested special pleading.
Fortunately, the Senate Committee strongly supports the case for increased
funding of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner
, particularly for
strategic policy functions, and also urges the introduction of private sector
auditing powers. The Commissioner
specifically requests funding for consumer
and complaint handling
The Commissioner identifies a number of additional powers that would increase
the effectiveness of the private sector provisions –
these include the
power to require remedial action on systemic issues both in complaint
Determinations and after ‘own-motion’
investigations, and initiation
of binding Codes or Guidelines
Valuable resources
While this article has focussed on the main recommendations of both reports,
they also contain much useful discussion and analysis
of a wide range of issues,
including areas in which no firm findings or recommendations are made. The
reports, and the many detailed
submissions, provide a valuable resource for
future debate.
