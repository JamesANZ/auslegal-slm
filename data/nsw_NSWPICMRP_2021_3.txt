MERIT REVIEW PANEL MEMBERS:
Brett Williams (Chair)
Terence O’Riain
Michael Sofoulis
DATE OF DECISION:
29 July 2021
CATCHWORDS:
MOTOR ACCIDENTS-
Merit Review Panel; quantification of the
Claimant’s weekly benefits; pre-accident earning capacity (PAWE) and his
post-accident
earning capacity (PAEC); Claimant is a director and equal
shareholder of company operating a motel; whether Claimant’s PAWE
be determined by reference to director’s fees alone; whether PAWE should
be determined by attributing 50% of company’s
adjusted profit; whether
exceptional circumstances exist in accordance with section 8.10(4)(b) of the
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
(MAI Act) to permit Commission to permit
payment of costs in excess of regulated costs;
the Motel is a
business carried on by the company, a legal entity in its own right, and not the
Claimant; neither the Motel nor the
company are businesses carried on by the
Claimant in partnership; the Claimant’s only income from personal exertion
by him as an earner during the 12 months immediately before the
accident were the director’s fees from the company; the management
paid to the Claimant reflect his capacity to earn in the employment in which he
was engaged immediately before the motor accident,
determined on the basis of
his fitness for work in that employment during that period; having regard to the
nature and complexity
of the dispute, together with the work performed by the
Claimant’s lawyers, exceptional circumstances exist that justify the
Commission permitting payment of the Claimant’s reasonable and necessary
legal costs in connection with the Panel review in
accordance with section
8.10(4)(b) of the MAI Act; the merit review decision of 4 September 2020 is set
aside; decision made in substitution.
DETERMINATIONS MADE:
1. The merit review decision of Merit Reviewer Medland dated 4 September
2020 is set aside.
2. In substitution the Merit Review Panel finds:
(a) the Claimant’s pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE)
are $1,608.35;
(b) for the period during which the Claimant suffered a total
loss of earnings, 15 December 2018 – 9 January 2019, the Insurer
the Claimant weekly payments in accordance with s 3.6 on the basis that his PAWE
are $1,608.35;
(c) for the period 10 January 2019 – 15 December 2019, during which
the Claimant suffered a partial loss of earning capacity,
the Insurer is to
determine the Claimant’s post-accident earning capacity on the basis that
it is the weekly average of the
gross director’s fees received by the
Claimant for the period 10 January 2019 to 15 December 2019, and
(d) the Claimant’s entitlement to weekly payments of
statutory benefits under ss 3.6 and 3.7 are to be determined accordingly.
3. The amount of the Claimant’s costs assessed in
accordance with the Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017 (the MAI Act) is $6,600
inclusive of GST.
1. The decision of Merit Reviewer
Medland dated 4 September 2020 has been referred to the Merit Review Panel (the
Panel) for review.
2. All Panel members confirmed that they had no previous
involvement with this matter. All Panel members also confirmed that there
conflict or any other reason that they would be unable to approach this review
with an open mind.
3. The Claimant was involved in a single
vehicle motor accident on 15 December 2018. He submitted a claim for benefits
dated 10 January
2019. The claim was received by the Insurer on 14 January 2019.
Liability to pay benefits for the first 26 weeks was accepted by
the Insurer by
letter dated 22 January 2019. A dispute in relation to whether the Claimant was
mostly at fault for the accident was
resolved in his
. As a result, the Claimant
was entitled to benefits after the first 26 weeks.
4. At the time of the accident the Claimant and his wife were
directors and equal shareholders of ACJ Holdings Pty Limited (ACJ
. ACJHP operated the XX Motel in
Mudgee (the Motel).
5. The Claimant was born on XX June 1939. He was 79 years of age
when the accident occurred. Having reached retiring age at the time
accident the Claimant’s entitlement to receive weekly benefits is limited
to 12 months.
As a corollary, the
Claimant was limited to recovering weekly benefits for the first entitlement
and for 39 weeks during the
second entitlement period.
6. The matters in dispute relate to the Claimant’s
entitlements to weekly payments of statutory benefits in accordance with
Division 3.3. There is a dispute about the quantification of the
Claimant’s weekly benefits, specifically with respect to his
pre- accident
earning capacity (PAWE) and his post-accident earning capacity (PAEC).
7. The Insurer paid the Claimant weekly benefits on the basis that his PAWE
His post-accident weekly
earnings (as opposed to PAEC) were determined by the Insurer to be $2,124.57. On
14 May 2020 the Insurer
informed the Claimant that his loss of earnings had been
calculated to be $53.70 per week.
This amount represents the difference between $2,178.27 and $2,124.57.
8. The Claimant asked the Insurer to conduct an internal review
in relation to the decision about his weekly payment entitlements.
The internal
reviewer affirmed the Insurer’s original decision on 16 June
9. The Claimant subsequently made an application for a merit
review of the Insurer’s internal review decision.
The decision under review
10. The merit review was determined by
the merit reviewer on 4 September 2020 (the merit decision). The merit reviewer
ss 3.6 and 3.7, together with relevant provisions in Schedule 1. The
merit reviewer affirmed the Insurer’s internal review
11. The merit reviewer was not satisfied that the net profit of
ACJ HP, as set out in the profit and loss statements, constituted
“dividends”.
12. On the basis that the net profit of ACJ HP was not
distributed to the shareholders as dividends the merit reviewer found that
Schedule 1 clause 3(3)(b) did not apply. She found that the net profit of ACJ HP
constituted retained earnings of ACJ HP and represented
proceeds of a business
carried on by the Claimant. It followed that clause 3(2)(b) applied and that the
undistributed net profit
of ACJ HP was to be included in the calculation of the
Claimant’s “income from personal exertion”.
13. The reasoning in the reports from PKF(NS) Accountants Pty
Limited (PKF) was found by the merit reviewer to be correct as was the
Insurer’s calculation of the Claimant’s PAWE and his post-accident
earning capacity. The merit reviewer was not satisfied
that management fees for
the 2019 financial year were apportioned between pre and post- accident.
14. The Claimant subsequently applied to the Dispute Resolution
Service (DRS) for a review of the merit decision (the application).
2021, having found that there was reasonable cause to suspect that the merit
decision was incorrect in a material respect,
the President’s delegate
accepted the application and referred it to this merit review panel to review
the merit decision in
accordance with s 7.15 of the MAI Act.
Transitional matters
15. The Personal Injury Commission (the
PIC) was established on 1 March 2021. The application was lodged on 12 October
2020, before
the PIC was established. In accordance with Sch 1 Part 2 cl 14A and
cl 14B of the
Personal Injury Commission Act 2020
(the PIC Act), the
application constitutes pending proceedings and pre- establishment proceedings
that we are empowered to determine.
Conduct of the review
Panel is required to decide what the correct and preferable decision is, is not
bound by the rules of evidence and may inquire
into any matter relevant to the
issues in dispute in such manner as the Panel sees fit. The Panel may confirm
the decision of the
single merit reviewer or set aside the decision and make a
decision in substitution for the decision the review panel sets
17. The Panel met by teleconference on 11 May 2021. Merit
Reviewer Williams acted as chairperson of the Panel. The Panel determined
it would be assisted by further submissions from the parties. Directions were
made in that regard on 13 May 2021.
18. Submissions were subsequently provided by the parties. The
Claimant sought an oral hearing. Having regard to the issues in dispute
Panel agreed that an oral hearing was appropriate.
19. A hearing took place by
teleconference on 2 July 2021. At the commencement of the hearing the Panel
confirmed with the parties
that all evidence upon which they relied in the
review was attached to the Claimant’s submissions dated 1 June 2021. The
is listed in the index provided with those submissions. Although it is
not referred to in the index, the PKF report dated 7 May 2020
is included in the
evidence attached to the Claimant’s submissions and is relied on, together
with two other PKF reports, by
the Insurer.
20. In addition to oral submissions made at the hearing, the
Claimant relies on written submissions dated 12 October 2020 and 1 June
primarily the latter. The Insurer relies on written submissions dated 24 July
2020, 21 October 2020 and 16 June 2021.
21. As a consequence of the constructive approach taken by the
parties, the issues in dispute were narrowed significantly at the hearing.
22. The following matters were agreed by the parties:
(a) for the purposes of s 3.6 the Claimant is an
‘earner’ as defined in Schedule 1 cl. 2 of the MAI Act;
(b) for the purposes of s 3.6 the Claimant suffered a total or
partial loss of earnings as a result of injury sustained in the accident;
(c) the Claimant is entitled to weekly payments of statutory
benefits in accordance with s 3.6 during the first entitlement period;
(d) for the purposes of s 3.7 the Claimant is an
‘earner’ as defined in Schedule 1 cl. 2 of the MAI Act;
(e) for the purposes of s 3.7 the Claimant suffered a partial
loss of earnings as a result of injury sustained in the accident;
(f) the Claimant is entitled to weekly payments of statutory
benefits in accordance with s 3.7 during the period 17 March 2019 –
December 2019;
(g) during the first entitlement period (s 3.6):
(i) the Claimant was totally unfit for work from 15 December
January 2019;
(ii) the Claimant was partially fit for some work from 10
January 2019 – 31 January 2019 for 15 hours per week, and
(iii) the Claimant was partially fit for some work from 1
February 2019 – 16 March 2019 for six hours per week.
(h) during the second entitlement period (s.3.7):
(i) the Claimant was partially fit for work from 17 March 2019
– 9 April 2019 for six hours per week, and
(ii) The Claimant was partially fit for work from 10 April 2019
– 15 December 2019 for nine hours per week.
(i) the Claimant and his wife were Directors and equal shareholders of ACJ HP
at all relevant times;
(j) ACJ HP operated the X Motel in Mudgee NSW, and
(k) in the 12 months immediately before the subject accident the
Clamant received from ACJ HP directors fees in the gross sum of $83,634.61,
which equates to $1,608.35 gross per week during that 12-month period.
23. The parties agreed that the matters in dispute are:
(a) the Claimant’s pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE) for
the purposes of sections 3.6 and 3.7;
(b) the Claimant’s post-accident earning capacity for the
purposes of sections
3.6 and 3.7,
(c) the quantification of the Claimant’s weekly benefits
in accordance with sections 3.6 and 3.7.
24. In summary, the Claimant’s submissions at the hearing
were as follows:
(a) he is an ‘earner’ within the meaning of Schedule 1 cl. 2(a)
because he was employed by ACJ HP at the time of the
accident. This submission
was made for the first time at the hearing; the Claimant’s written
submissions arguing that he was
self-employed;
(b) his PAWE should be calculated on the basis of the
director’s fees he received from ACJ HP in the 12 months immediately
before the accident.
Accordingly, his PAWE are $1,608.35, and
(c) his post-accident earning capacity should be quantified in
monetary terms on the basis of his actual earnings by way of director’s
fees received from ACJ HP post-accident and his entitlements under ss 3.6 and
3.7 determined accordingly.
25. Ms Zogopoulos confirmed that the Insurer relied on the
reports of PKF to determine the Claimant’s entitlement to weekly
26. It was noted by the Panel that PKF did not consider
post-accident earning capacity. This is a matter that is considered later
these reasons.
27. The Claimant sought an order for costs from the Commission
on the basis that exceptional circumstances exist in accordance with
8.10(4)(b) of the MAI Act. The Insurer did not oppose the Commission making a
costs order on that basis.
28. At the conclusion of the hearing the parties sought and were
given additional time to explore whether resolution of the dispute
achieved. Resolution of the claim was not achieved. Accordingly, the Panel has
proceeded to determine the dispute.
Relevant Statutory Provisions
29. The Claimant’s entitlement to
statutory benefits is governed by Part 3 of the MAI Act. Entitlements to weekly
payments of
statutory benefits are determined in accordance with Division 3.3.
Of particular relevance to these proceedings are sections 3.6

31. Definitions relating to earnings for the purposes of weekly
payments of statutory benefits under Division 3.3 are found in Schedule
MAI Act. The definitions are, relevantly, in the following terms:
“2 Meaning of “earner”

(d) any medical certificate provided by the injured person as to the
person’s fitness for work.
32. We will make reference to relevant
aspects of the evidence as we address the matters in dispute.
33. It is convenient at this point to address the three reports
from PKF, dated 3 April 2019, 23 December 2019 and 7 May 2020, which
on by the Insurer. These reports informed the Insurer’s decisions in
relation to the Claimant’s entitlements
3.3 and are
relied on by the Insurer in these proceedings. The following is a summary of the
opinions expressed in the PKF reports:
3 April 2019 report
Claimant’s PAWE was determined on the basis of ACJ HP ’s 2018 profit
and loss (P&L) statements and the P&L
statement for the period 1 July
2018 – 31 December 2018.
The 2018 P&L
statement was pro-rated to calculate the profit and loss for the period 15
December 2017 – 30 June 2018 as
was the P&L for the period to 31
December 2018 to calculate the profit and loss for the period 1 July 2018
– 15 December
2018 (the 52 weeks prior to the
It was noted
that the Claimant received management fees from ACJ HP which are confirmed in
his personal tax return. To determine the
Claimant’s PAWE, PKF added back
the management fees and attributed 50% of ACJ HP ’s adjusted profit to the
Claimant’s PAWE was assessed to be $2,178.27. Relevant calculations are
contained in annexure 1 to the report.
23 December 2019 report
P&L for ACJ HP to 30 June 2019 was considered. These records were not
available when the April 2019 report was prepared.
To determine the
Claimant’s post-accident weekly earnings ACJ HP ’s P&L
statements for the periods 1 July 2018 to
31 December 2018 and 1 January 2019
– 30 June 2019 were relied on. The December 2018 P&L was pro-rated to
calculate P&L
for the period 16 December 2018 – 31 December 2018.
On the basis
that management fees received by the Claimant from ACJ HP are discretionary it
was assumed that the net income of ACJ
HP represented earnings at the control of
shareholders (the Claimant and his wife). The management fees received by the
were added back to the ACJ HP ’s P&L and 50% of ACJ HP
’s adjusted profit was attributed to the Claimant.
Claimant’s post-accident weekly earnings were determined to
$1,945.64. Relevant calculations are contained in annexure 1 to the
7 May 2020 report
report was provided in response to a request that post-accident weekly earnings
be assessed for the period 16 December 2018 –
16 December 2019, following
review of ACJ HP ’s 2019 tax return and P&L for the periods 1 July
2018 – 31 December
2018, 1 January 2019 – 30 June 2019 and 1 July
2019 – 31 December 2019.
The December
2018 and 2019 P&L statements were pro-rated to determine the profit and loss
for the period 16 December 2018 –
31 December 2018, and 1 July 2019
– 16 December 2019.
Noting that
management fees are discretionary, it was assumed that the net income of ACJ HP
represents the net income of the company
represents earnings at the control of
the shareholders. The Claimant’s management fees were added back and 50%
of ACJ HP ’s
profit attributed to the Claimant.
Claimant’s post-accident weekly earnings (again referred to as
“PAWE”) were determined to be $2,124.57.
The Insurer’s submissions
34. In addition to submissions made at
the hearing, the Insurer relies on written submissions dated 24 July 2020, 21
October 2020
and 16 June 2021.
35. In summary, the Insurer’s submissions of 24 July 2020,
which were prepared in response to the Claimant’s application
review, argue that:
(a) the Claimant’s PAWE is $2,178.27 and his post-accident
weekly earnings are $2,124.57;
(b) PKF’s methodology was correct in determining PAWE and
post-accident weekly earnings, and
(c) based on PAWE of $2,178.27 and post-accident weekly earnings
$2,124.57, the Claimant’s loss of earnings was $53.70 per week, or
$2,792.40 from 16 December 2018 to 15 December 2019.
36. The 21 October 2020 submissions address s 7.15(2) of the MAI
Act. The Insurer argues that the Claimant’s review application
dismissed as there is no material error disclosed in the merit decision. It is
also argued that there is an absence of
exceptional circumstances to warrant a
costs order.
37. In its 16 June 2021 submissions, the Insurer states that it
relies on its 21 October 2020 submissions. The Insurer confirms that
it does not
dispute the entitlement to statutory benefits for the first and second
entitlement periods. The Insurer argues that exceptional
circumstances do not
exist so as to justify a costs order in accordance with 8.10(4)(b). We note,
however, that at the hearing the
Insurer did not oppose the Commission making a
costs order in accordance with s 8.10(4)(b).
Determination of PAWE
38. PAWE is to be determined in
accordance with Sch 1 cl. 4. As none of the exceptions found in cl. 4(2) apply,
PAWE is determined
in accordance with cl. 4(1). Thus, for the purpose of these
proceedings, PAWE means the weekly average of the gross earnings received
Claimant as an earner during the 12 months immediately before the day on which
the motor accident occurred.
39. The Claimant argues that the only earnings he received as an
earner in the 12 months immediately before the accident were the
director’s fees from ACJ HP. At the hearing the parties agreed that in the
12 months immediately before the accident the Clamant
received from ACJ HP
directors fees in the sum of $83,634.61, which equates to
$1,608.35 gross per week during that 12-month period. On this basis, the
Claimant argues that his PAWE are $1,608.35.
40. The Insurer argues that the Claimant’s PAWE should be
calculated in accordance with the methodology applied by PKF in their
April 2019. The approach adopted by PKF was to determine PAWE by attributing 50%
of ACJ HP ’s adjusted profit to
the Claimant, after adding back the
management fees paid to him. This results in PAWE of $2,178.27.
41. The Claimant argues that ACJ HP is a separate and distinct
legal entity. Accordingly, the Claimant says ACJ HP ’s profit
relevant to determining his PAWE.
42. Schedule 1 contains no definition of ‘earnings’
for the purposes of Division 3.3. However, “loss of earnings”
defined in Sch.1 cl.3. Although cl. 3 defines “loss of earnings” and
not ‘earnings’, so as to construe
Division 3.3 and Schedule 1 in a
cohesive way, it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that, as “loss of
means “a loss incurred or likely to be incurred in a
person’s income from personal exertion”, ‘earnings’
should be taken to mean “a person’s income from personal
exertion”. “A person’s income from personal
exertion” is
income of the type referred to in Sch 1 sub-cl. 3(2) and excludes income of the
43. The accident occurred on 15 December 2018. The relevant 12 month period
for the purposes of cl.4(1) cuts across the tax years
ending 30 June 2017 and 30
June 2018. The tax returns lodged by the Claimant in each of those years reflect
that the Claimant’s
sole source of income, other than interest, was from
44. On the evidence available to us, we find that the
Claimant’s income from personal exertion in the 12 months before the
that falls within sub-cl. 3(2)(a), is the income he received from ACJ
HP by way of director’s fees. The parties agree that
this income amounts
to $83,634.61 gross, which equates to $1,608.35 gross per week for that 12-month
45. In accordance with sub-cl 3(2)(b) a person’s income
from personal exertion includes the proceeds of any business carried
person either alone or in partnership with any other person.
46. On the evidence available to us the only business that is
relevant for the purposes of sub-cl 3(2)(b) is the Motel. In his statement
13 July 2020 the Claimant gives evidence that ACJ HP owns the
His wife gives consistent
evidence in her statement of the same date
1212 At [3].
47. On the basis of this evidence, we are satisfied that the
Motel is a business carried on by ACJ HP, a legal entity in its’
right, and not the Claimant.
48. If we are wrong about this, and the Claimant is considered
to have been carrying on the Motel business, it cannot be said that
business carried on by him alone. If he was carrying on the Motel business, so
was his wife.
49. Neither the Motel or ACJ HP are businesses carried on by the
Claimant in partnership. The term ‘partnership’ is a
arrangement recognised by law. The term is defined in
Partnership
(NSW) as follows:
“1 Definition of partnership
(1) Partnership is the relation which
exists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit
and includes an
incorporated limited partnership.
(2) But the relation between members of any company or
association which is:
(a) incorporated under the
Corporations Act 2001
Commonwealth, or
(b) Formed or incorporated by or in pursuance of any other Act
of Parliament or Letters Patent or Royal Charter,
is not a Partnership within the meaning of this Act.”
50. There is no evidence that ACJ HP is an incorporated limited
partnership. As ACJ HP is incorporated under the
Corporations Act
expressly excluded from the definition of ‘partnership’.
51. There is no evidence that the Claimant received any amount
as bounty or subsidy in carrying on a business for the purposes of
52. In these circumstances, we find that the Claimant’s
only income from personal exertion received by him as an earner during
months immediately before the accident were the director’s fees from ACJ
HP. These fees are agreed in the gross sum
$83,634.61. We find that this sum represents the gross earnings received by the
Claimant as an earner during the 12 months immediately
before the accident. The
weekly average of this amount, calculated over 52 weeks, is $1,608.35.
Accordingly, we find that the Claimant’s
PAWE are $1,608.35.
Determination of post-accident earning capacity
53. The Insurer appears to have
determined the Claimant’s entitlements under ss 3.6 and
3.7 by reference to his post-accident
, as opposed to his
post-accident earning
54. Both s 3.6 and 3.7 require weekly payments to be determined
by reference to “...the difference between the person’s
pre-accident
weekly earnings and the person’s post- accident earning capacity (if any)
To the extent that
the Insurer has determined the Claimant’s entitlements under ss 3.6 and
3.7 on the basis of his post-accident
earnings as opposed to the post-accident
earning capacity, the Insurer has applied the wrong test.
55. The parties agree that:
(a) during the first entitlement period (s 3.6):
(i) the Claimant was totally unfit for work from 15 December
January 2019;
(ii) the Claimant was partially fit for some work from 10
January 2019 – 31 January 2019 for 15 hours per week, and
(iii) the Claimant was partially fit for some work from 1
February 2019 – 16 March 2019 for 6 hours per week.
(b) during the second entitlement period (s.3.7):
(i) the Claimant was partially fit for work from 17 March 2019
– 9 April 2019 for six hours per week, and
(ii) the Claimant was partially fit for work from 10 April 2019 – 15
December 2019 for nine hours per week.
56. With respect to the balance of the period during which the
Claimant is entitled to weekly benefits the critical issue that remains
determination, given the matters that are agreed by the parties, is the
quantification of the Claimant’s PAEC.
57. The evidence discloses that as a consequence of the accident
the Claimant suffered a burst fracture of the fourth lumbar vertebra,
of his left seventh rib and soft tissue
58. In his statement the Claimant says that he was working
‘about 73 hours per week’ prior to the accident.
Pre-accident, the tasks he
performed at the Motel included: managerial duties, showing guests to their
rooms, delivering breakfast
trays to guests, attending the reception desk and
dealing with bookings, check-ins and check-outs, attending to guest enquiries
requests, recruiting and supervising employees and contractors, painting
motel units and the motel exterior, performing simple repairs,
maintenance and
gardening, attending to deliveries and supplies, banking, arranging advertising,
promotions and the motel website.
He states that he was able to carry out these tasks without restriction
prior to the accident.
59. The Claimant states that when he was able to return to some
form of work post- accident all he could do was take telephone calls
and process
telephone bookings. He says he could not have performed the tasks he was
undertaking pre-accident.
60. The Claimant’s wife states that pre-accident he would
perform most of the physical tasks around the Motel without
restriction.
Post-accident, she
says the Claimant was greatly restricted in his ability to carry out many tasks
around the Motel
and that she
has been required to carry out many of the tasks previously performed by the
Other staff and
handymen have been required to undertake some of the tasks previously performed
by the Claimant.
61. Post-accident earning capacity is defined in Sch 1 cl.8,
relevant terms of which are set out earlier in these reasons. The
PAEC for the periods in question is the weekly amount that he
had the capacity to earn in the employment in which he was engaged
immediately
before the motor accident, determined on the basis of his fitness for work in
that employment.
62. We are comfortably satisfied, by reference to the nature of
the Claimant’s injuries, his process of recovery, his treatment
, and the certificates of
fitness provided by
that while the Claimant had some
capacity to earn from 10 January 2019 to 15 December 2019, his fitness to
undertake work of the nature
he performed pre- accident was very limited.
Quantification of weekly payments
63. For the period during which it is
agreed that the Claimant suffered a total loss of earnings as a result of
injuries caused by
the accident, 15 December 2018 – 9 January 2019, the
Insurer is to pay the Claimant benefits in accordance with s 3.6 on the
that his PAWE are $1,608.35.
64. It is agreed by the parties that the Claimant suffered a
partial loss of earnings for the period 10 January 2019 – 15 December
65. Prior to the accident the Claimant and his wife received
management fees from ACJ HP in equal amounts, reflecting their contribution
the running of the Motel.
Following the accident, the management fees paid to the Claimant were less
than those he received pre-accident.
66. In all the circumstances, we find that the management fees
paid to the Claimant for the period 10 January 2019 to 15 December
reflect his capacity to earn in the employment in which he was engaged
immediately before the motor accident, determined
on the basis of his fitness
for work in that employment during that period.
67. The Insurer is to determine the Claimant’s
post-accident earning capacity on the basis that it is the weekly average of
gross director’s fees received by the Claimant for the period 10 January
2019 to 15 December 2019.
68. The Claimant’s entitlements under ss 3.6 and 3.7
should be determined accordingly.
69. The Claimant submits that the
Commission should permit the payment of legal costs incurred by him on the basis
that exceptional
circumstances exist that justify payment of those costs.
70. On the basis of the information available to the Panel it is
apparent that the Claimant’s lawyers performed legal work that
the following:
(a) obtaining instructions;
(b) preparing the application for review;
(c) drafting written submissions dated 12 October 2020 and 1
(d) reading and advising on the Insurer’s written
submissions, and
(e) advocacy at the hearing conducted by teleconference on 2 July 2021.
71. Costs in statutory benefit matters are regulated under s
8.10 of the MAI Act and Schedule 1, Part 1, clause 1 of the
Motor Accident
Injuries Regulation
2017 (the Regulation).
72. The maximum costs for legal services provided in connection
with a review of a decision about any merit review matter by a review
regulated by sub-cl. (3) of Schedule 1, Part 1, clause 1 of the Regulation and
are capped at 16 monetary units.
73. The Claimant’s solicitor has performed considerable
work in connection with the Panel Review.
74. In the Insurer’s submissions dated 21 October 2020 it
argues that there was an absence of exceptional circumstances to warrant
order in accordance with s 8.10(4)(b). Those arguments were repeated in the
subsequent written submissions.
75. However, at the hearing on 2 July 2021, the Insurer’s
representative did not dispute that this case had raised complex issues.
76. In the Claimant’s submissions dated 1 June 2021 the
Claimant relies on
AAI Ltd trading as GIO v Moon
[2020] NSWSC 714 (Moon)
in support of the order for costs sought under s 8.10(4)(b). As a guideline on
costs the Claimant’s solicitor referred the
panel to his costs agreement
with the Claimant and says that he performed 20 hours work valued at $550 per
77. The Panel finds that, having regard to the nature and
complexity of the dispute, together with the work performed by the
lawyers, exceptional circumstances exist that justify the
Commission permitting payment of the Claimant’s reasonable and necessary
legal costs in connection with the Panel review in accordance with section
8.10(4)(b) of the MAI Act.
78. We find that the sum of $6,600 inclusive of GST reflects
those reasonable and necessary costs.
79. The merit review decision of Merit
Reviewer Medland dated 4 September 2020 is set aside. In substitution the Merit
Review Panel
(a) the Claimant’s pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE) are
(b) for the period during which the Claimant suffered a total
loss of earnings, 15 December 2018 – 9 January 2019, the Insurer
the Claimant weekly payments in accordance with s 3.6 on the basis that his PAWE
are $1,608.35;
(c) for the period 10 January 2019 – 15 December 2019,
during which the Claimant suffered a partial loss of earning capacity,
Insurer is to determine the Claimant’s post-accident earning capacity on
the basis that it is the weekly average of the
gross director’s fees
received by the Claimant for the period 10 January 2019 to 15 December 2019,
(d) the Claimant’s entitlement to weekly payments of
statutory benefits under ss 3.6 and 3.7 are to be determined accordingly.
80. The amount of the Claimant’s costs assessed in
accordance with the MAI Act is
$6,600 inclusive of GST.
