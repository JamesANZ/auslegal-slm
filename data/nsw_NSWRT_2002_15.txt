If these orders are not

REASONS FOR DECISION
On 30 October 2001 the agent for the landlord, Charles Shore Holdings Pty
Ltd filed an application at the Residential Tribunal in
Sydney seeking
termination of the tenancy and rent arrears from the tenant Mr Hampson, for the
premises located at ... Ashfield NSW.
The matter came before the
Tribunal on 19 November 2001. The Member who heard the matter on that day made
extensive enquires of both
parties, in particular the tenant, as to the reasons
why the tenant was in arrears, of $235.70 for the period from 10 November 2001
to the date of hearing inclusive.
On the basis of the evidence, the
Member was satisfied that a breach of the agreement had occurred, in that rent
arrears were owing.
The Member made orders for the full amount of the arrears
to be paid on or before 3 December 2001 as well as providing for the tenant
pay his rent of $330.00 per fortnight on time, the next payment being due on 24
November 2001. The landlord was also granted
the right to re-list the matter
for hearing of the matter at any time before 19 February 2002.
November 2001, the agent acting on behalf of the landlord sought the re-listing
of the matter, which was granted. The matter
was re-scheduled to be heard on 10
December 2001.
At the hearing on 10 December 2001 the parties attended
and attempted conciliation. However, as the parties were unable to reach
agreement the matter was heard by the Tribunal.
EVIDENCE OF THE
At the hearing the landlord’s agent provided a copy of
the rental ledger, which disclosed that following the hearing on 19 November
2001 that the tenant had made the following rental payments:
20/11/2001 -
28/11/2001 - $80.00
3/12/2001 - $150.00
4/12/2001 -
Further, as at the date of hearing the landlord’s agent
advised that the tenant was $200.70 in arrears of rent and that he was
termination of the tenancy on the instructions of the landlord.
EVIDENCE OF THE TENANT
confirmed his evidence, which had been given to the Tribunal previously and
which in summary was that:
The tenant had owned a video rental
shop in Croydon that was closed in May 2001.
The tenant’s father had passed
away in May 2000. The tenant had been seeing a psychologist at Burwood in
relation to personal
problems since August 2001.
In mid-September to early October
2001 the person who was sharing the flat with the tenant, was claimed to have
stolen money for 2
weeks rent from the tenant.
The tenant also reiterated the claim
he made previously, that he would be able to clear all of his arrears by the end
of December
The Residential Tribunal is a body established under legislation by the
New South Wales Government to deal with tenancy disputes between
landlords and
Although the Residential Tribunal is empowered to terminate
tenancies if satisfied that it should do so, it must have regard to the
decisions of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which has established
precedent in respect of the manner in which the Residential
Tribunal is to use
those powers which have been granted under legislation.
In the matter
Swain v Residential Tenancies Tribunal
, Rolfe J, of the NSW
Supreme Court, held that, in every case where a landlord is seeking termination
of the residential tenancy agreement,
the Residential Tribunal must have regard
to the particular circumstances of the tenant before deciding whether it is
appropriate
to terminate the tenancy agreement. He noted that:
landlord has an absolute right to give notice seeking to terminate the agreement
without specifying a reason. However, if the
tenant does not vacate in
accordance with the notice, the landlord does not have an absolute right to
orders of possession and termination
of the agreement: the Tribunal must be
satisfied of certain matters before making such orders. In particular, it was
the Tribunal must have regard to section 64(2)(c): it must be
satisfied that the orders are appropriate having considered "the circumstances
of the case".
On appeal, in
Roads and Traffic Authority v Swain
New South Wales Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Rolfe J. Meagher J. A
(with whom Priestly and Cole JJ. A. agreed) commented
for the termination of residential tenancy agreements set out in the legislation
is clear ... a formally valid notice is
required ... If the tenant fails to
deliver up vacant possession on the day specified, the landlord may then apply
to the Tribunal
for orders for possession and termination of the agreement ...
The Tribunal is empowered to make the orders sought by the landlord
satisfied of certain things, being those referred to in section 64(2). Those
things are the factual issues surrounding the
particular case.
summary, Meagher J. A concluded that:
I think it can be fairly stated
that the Act is intended to balance the rights of landlords and tenants. The
argument urged against
accepting Rolfe J’s interpretation of s 64(2) is
that it could be unduly harsh on the landlord. That argument fails as hardship
to the landlord is something which the Tribunal must consider as part of the
"circumstances of the case".
In this case, the evidence disclosed
that the tenant was required by previous orders to make payments of rent and
arrears. The tenant
had made three such payments against those orders but at
the date of the second hearing was some $200.70 in arrears, equating to
The Tribunal was satisfied that:
The arrears had declined from what they
were at the original hearing;
The tenant had
demonstrated a commitment to the tenancy by the payments on 28 November 2001, 3
December 2001 and 4 December 2001 of
At the subsequent hearing the
tenant was only $200.70 in arrears while the landlord held the tenant’s
bond of some $660.00;
The tenant had
suffered from life circumstances, which had seen him fall behind in his
The tenant had been in the premises
for over 12 months paying rent;
was committed to paying all of his arrears on or before 21 December 2001 and to
pay his rent of $330.00 per fortnight,
which was next due on 15 December 2001.
On behalf of the landlord against whose situation the
tenants must be measured, no particular factors of hardship or difficulty were
in evidence. The landlord was noted to be the owner of the entire block of
units. No information regarding his financial position,
for example, was
provided by his agent from which it could be ascertained whether he was
suffering any hardship as a result of the
tenant not paying his rent on time.
On the basis of the evidence presented, orders were made requiring the
tenant to pay his arrears and his rent on a regular basis and
the landlord was
given an opportunity to re-list the matter for further orders (including
termination) if the tenant did not comply
with the orders made, at any time
before 10 March 2002.
