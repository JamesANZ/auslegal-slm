Oates, Adam Grant (2023 TASCD 138), Responses [2023] TasCorCResp 2 (6 March 2023)
Response received from Clarence City Council 16 August 2023.
In the report published, there was reference to a heavy indentation known as a rut on the gravel road edge approximately 50 metres
from the crash site. As noted in the report, the rutting in the road edge is triggered by road users cutting through the shoulder
of the road. The report states that the rut was not identified as a contributing factor to the crash.
The recommendation of the report was made for Clarence City Council to ‘assess this rut and repair it if the assessment deems it
necessary’. This was reported in the Mercury newspaper article of 20 June 2023 titled ‘Snapchat posts 12min before fatal ute
crash’. Council was not consulted before the publication of the report or article.
In reference to the Coroner’s recommendation to council, I can confirm the gravel road edge is part of council’s ongoing road
maintenance program and repair of the rut was undertaken between 19 August and 19 September 2021, within weeks of the death of Mr
Oates. Since this time the road has been re-edged as part of regular maintenance in the area, most recently in early 2023. Council
acknowledges the rutting is prone to regression given the practice of road users cutting the corner and driving on the gravel edge.
Council is committed to maintaining council roads to providing safe roads for all users. The rut is on council’s maintenance schedule
and will continue to be maintained as part of council’s road maintenance program.
