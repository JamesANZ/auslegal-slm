DOORS’ AND THE CICC’S ONE-STOP PLATFORM: REFLECTIONS ON
INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN
As an innovative approach to cross-border commercial disputes, one-stop
mechanisms incorporate both litigation and non-litigation
for commercial
disputants to choose from. With various jurisdictions having established or
considered the establishment of their
own one-stop shops, this paper focuses on
the China International Commercial Court’s (‘CICC’) One-Stop
“revolving” functions — specifically, the
interaction between litigation, mediation and arbitration. Analysed through
law and economics lens, it assesses the One-Stop Platform’s economic and
legal implications, highlighting its unique benefits
in terms of economic costs,
efficiency and unquantified advantages. It also examines significant
shortcomings within the CICC’s
institutional design, comparing these with
the shortcomings of similar initiatives globally. This paper presents targeted
recommendations
to enhance the synergies among the dispute resolution modes
offered by the CICC, aiming to optimise both economic and procedural
efficiencies. We argue that the current architecture of the One-Stop Platform is
in its infancy, especially due to the lack of transition
between arbitration and
litigation and inadequate linkage between mediation and litigation.
Consequently, the CICC’s One-Stop
Platform fails to capitalise on its
potential distinct advantages over similar mechanisms in other jurisdictions.
This suggests the
necessity for systemic reforms to effectively integrate
arbitration into the revolving mechanism and amplify the role of mediation.
Moreover, we recommend that China implement concrete measures to activate the
CICC’s operations more effectively, improve service
quality and invest in
promoting and solidifying a robust reputation. Through these strategic
enhancements, the CICC can better fulfil
its promise as a pioneering model for
efficient and integrated dispute resolution on the international

At the normative level,
whether the institutional design of the One-Stop Platform has the potential to
achieve its goals remains to
be assessed. Moreover, the practical functionality
of the One-Stop Platform remains somewhat ambiguous. Unlike the binary approach
that mandates choosing a single dispute resolution mechanism, one-stop
mechanisms allow disputants to switch between litigation,
mediation and
arbitration up to a certain extent. This flexibility could, in theory, offer
more benefits than costs, contingent upon
the platform’s specific

factors like its economic implications, efficiency gains and unquantified

proposes reforms to refine the design of the CICC’s One-Stop Platform from
both legal and economic
perspectives. These reforms focus on reducing
transaction costs and enhancing unquantified advantages, crucial for boosting
the Platform’s
attractiveness, efficiency and reliability. By making these
adjustments, the reforms aim to better align the platform with its strategic
objectives, ensuring it serves as a more effective and neutral forum for
international dispute resolution. We argue that despite

II ONE-STOP
SHOPS AND THE CICC
Rise of the One-Stop Shops
Ever since post-World War II, London and New York have been established as
primary jurisdictions for cross-border commercial disputes

According to Matthew Erie’s empirical
fieldwork, one-stop shops or new legal
can now be observed in venues including Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Astana,
Shanghai and Shenzhen. In his definition, providing
an array of options for
dispute resolution is one, but not the only,
characteristic.
Elements such as
legal infrastructure, governmental support, business convenience and
“lawtech” have also received significant
consideration in the
evaluation process. This paper, however, mainly focuses on the connections
between different dispute resolution
mechanisms, more specifically, litigation,
arbitration and mediation. In particular, it analyses
institutionalised
one-stop mechanisms that address cross-institutional links or revolving
relationships between arbitration-mediation, arbitration-litigation
litigation-mediation.
A concrete example of a one-stop shop is Singapore’s network of dispute
resolution institutions (the Singapore International
Commercial Court
(‘SICC’), Singapore International Arbitration Centre
(‘SIAC’) and Singapore International
Mediation Centre
(‘SIMC’)) connected by internal cross-institutional links. These
three institutions enable Singapore
to implement its nationwide strategy of
establishing Singapore as a ‘premium dispute resolution
In particular, Singapore has set up Maxwell Chambers to facilitate cooperation

SIMC allows disputants to resort to mediation for eight
weeks during
arbitration. If the dispute is well-settled through mediation, the mediated

proceedings may resume.
More recently, the SICC and the SIMC jointly advanced a
litigation-mediation-litigation (‘LML’) initiative to promote
amicable dispute resolution mechanism in

exemplar of this trend is Dubai’s merger of the Emirates Maritime
Arbitration Centre and the Dubai International Financial
(‘DIFC’) arbitration institute into the Dubai International
Arbitration Centre (‘DIAC’). This consolidation
is anticipated to
boost Dubai’s standing as a premier global arbitration
DIFC’s Governor emphasised that merging the capabilities of the
arbitration centres considerably amplifies Dubai’s
stature as a foremost
global centre for dispute
resolution.
The DIFC fully backs this endeavour, perceiving it as a strategic move that
accentuates the Centre’s position as a prime choice
for proficient dispute
resolution.
This strategy aligns
with international standards and addresses the demands of the financial and
business sectors.
The inception of one-stop platforms, such as the DIAC, has showcased the
value of integrated mechanisms for dispute resolution. In
a parallel but
distinct evolution, specific courts have been established to address a similar
demand. The Netherlands Commercial
Court (‘NCC’), for example, was
influenced by observations that high-value, intricate international commercial

London Commercial Court, or through
arbitration.
Concurrently, the NCC is expected not only to foster a business-friendly
ambiance but also to generate opportunities for the local

LAW AND ECONOMICS ANALYSIS OF THE CICC’S ONE-STOP PLATFORM
Each type of dispute settlement mechanism possesses
its distinct strengths and shortcomings. The dynamic interplay between various
mechanisms can give rise to novel attributes and approaches. While the preceding

Economic considerations are paramount in the
decision-making process for parties choosing their preferred method of dispute
resolution.
While some posit that litigation and mediation generally incur
manageable costs, there is a growing sentiment that arbitration has

as a cornerstone of their objectives. As articulated
in art 1 of the
Procedural Rules
, the One-Stop Platform explicitly aims for economic
efficiency. This Section analyses how the institutional design of the
one-stop approach aligns with economic theories of cost-saving and
explores the specific mechanisms that aim to
this cost-saving objective.
First and foremost, the
advent of cross-border commercial litigation serves as an avenue to curtail
economic expenses. As arbitration
gains traction globally, international
commercial courts, distinct from domestic counterparts, cater specifically to
international
commercial litigation. These courts often generate significant
savings on arbitrator fees, institutional charges and hearing facility
This trend is evident in prominent international commercial courts like the
and the NCC.
A driving factor
behind this trend is that international commercial courts foster the
‘harmonisation’ of substantive
legal principles and civil
This streamlining not only boosts confidence and diminishes ambiguity in the
dispute resolution process but also reduces the transactional
costs associated
with cross-border business, bolstering trade and
investment.
Beyond the scope of
court expenses, certain international commercial courts offer broader cost
benefits. The NCC, for example, features
a simplified process, potentially
resulting in reduced legal fees.
It is also notable that Dutch lawyers often have more favourable rates compared
to their counterparts in places like

approach. The mediation-centric

instances where the CICC’s ICEC members handle dispute mediation, parties
are expected to collaboratively negotiate and agree
upon the expenses incurred
for the mediation services. Failure to reach an agreement will result in joint
liability for these expenses.

mediation systems in China’s domestic courts.

It is noteworthy that, unlike the usual practice where court judges assume
mediation roles, within the CICC’s framework the
mediation is conducted by
ICEC members or facilitated by international commercial mediation institutions
aligned with the CICC.
Thirdly, various procedure-related aspects
significantly contribute to the reduction of economic costs within international
courts. A prime example lies in the language and evidentiary rules
employed by the CICC. According to art 9 of the

streamlining the legal process for all involved
parties. This linguistic
adaptation not only simplifies the procedural journey but also results in
substantial cost and time savings
for all parties involved. Additionally, the
discovery systems in both the NCC and the SICC are reputed to further enhance
time efficiency. These systems streamline the evidentiary process,
mitigating the financial and temporal burden on disputing parties
and offering a
more expeditious path to resolution. In summary, the innovative procedural
adaptations within the CICC, such as language
flexibility, play a pivotal role
in diminishing the economic strain on parties navigating the dispute resolution
While direct cost savings
explicitly reduce transaction costs by minimising the financial expenditures
associated with different dispute
resolution methods, efficiency benefits also
play a pivotal role in lowering transaction costs through enhancements in the
and effectiveness of the dispute resolution process. Recognised as a
core objective of international commercial courts and their
institutionalised
one-stop mechanisms, these efficiency benefits, such as adaptive procedures and
broadened enforceability,
complement direct cost savings by improving operational aspects. The
CICC’s One-Stop Platform exemplifies this approach by
strategically
integrating litigation, mediation and arbitration and making improvements
including reducing the duration of proceedings,
increasing procedural
flexibility and streamlining enforcement of outcomes. Each element demonstrates
how the platform optimises
operational aspects and contributes to overall
efficiency.

At first glance, permitting parties to revolve

a critical trade-off exists. Investing additional time can potentially
enhance the dispute resolution processes and outcomes by providing
opportunities for resolution and the implementation of streamlined processes.
The CICC’s One-Stop Platform possesses unique
features that are designed
to strike a balance between time investment and resolution opportunities. This
balance is particularly
evident in the clear time limits imposed in the
pre-trial mediation phase, which ensure that the process remains as efficient as
possible without compromising the quality or fairness of dispute resolution.
Specifically, the provision of mediation within the One-Stop Platform stands
out as a notable factor in reducing time costs. Mediation,
by its nature, is
typically more time-efficient as it encourages ‘a collaborative approach
where both parties work together
to resolve the
distinctive feature of the One-Stop Platform is the explicit time limit set for
pre-trial mediation. According to the

if parties initially prefer not to pursue mediation, the Case Management Office
will promptly organise a schedule for litigation
procedures,
underscoring the
voluntary and optional nature of mediation within this framework. Despite this,
a few additional observations merit
attention. First, as per the
Procedural Rules
, a decision regarding mediation must be made within seven
days of case acceptance.
Beyond this period, the
SPC Provisions
do not offer clear guidelines
supporting mediation mechanisms during or after the litigation processes. This
represents a notable
distinction from the SICC’s LML frameworks, which
more explicitly support ongoing mediation
Contrarily, another
document highlights the prioritisation of mediation, stating that parties in
international commercial disputes
may opt for mediation at any stage of the
proceedings at the CICC.
Despite this provision, there remains a lack of specific rules for
implementation. To date, there has been no recorded instance of
parties opting
for mediation during later stages of a case. Secondly, in instances where
mediation is unsuccessful or parties opt
against it, the litigation timeline
remains ambiguous. As stipulated by the
Civil Procedure Law
duration can range from 30 days to six months or even longer, subject to
anticipated complexity and significant financial stakes of cases handled by the
CICC, the actual litigation duration may
substantially exceed initial
expectations.
Flexibility of the Procedure
A second potential efficiency benefit relates to the procedural aspects of
the dispute resolution mechanism. A key allure of arbitration
is its procedural
flexibility. Although litigation procedures can be more intricate, it is evident
that one-stop platforms endeavour
to maximise flexibility wherever possible.
Within the CICC’s One-Stop Platform, procedural flexibility manifests
in several ways. First, as previously noted, litigation
can support arbitration.
According to the
Civil Procedure Law
, requests for preservation
or arbitral award
enforcement
foreign-related cases are traditionally made to the intermediate people’s
court based on the respondent’s domicile
or the location of their
property. However, the CICC streamlines this by managing both preservation and
enforcement applications,
sparing parties the need for off-site submissions.
Given the substantial sums typically at stake within the One-Stop Platform, the
CICC has broadened the range of preservation measures it offers. While the
Arbitration Law of the People’s Republic of China (2017 Amendment)
limits preservation measures in arbitration to ‘property’ and
‘evidence’, the CICC explicitly introduces
preservation for parties involved in cases taken up by an arbitration
institution within the One-Stop
Secondly, the One-Stop Platform’s structure can streamline the
arbitration award review process, curbing potential delays arising
tiered reporting system. As per China’s existing verification process,
when dealing with foreign-related arbitration,
if a court is poised to rule an
arbitration agreement invalid, not to enforce or revoke an arbitral award, the
concerned intermediate
or special people’s court must seek verification
from the higher-level court within its jurisdiction. If this higher court
concurs with the decision, it then forwards the application to the SPC for
further verification. Only after the SPC’s review
can the originating
court pass its ruling based on the SPC’s
Procedural Rules

Streamlined
Enforcement
Enforcement of rulings and agreements has historically presented challenges
across litigation, mediation and arbitration contexts.
Traditional litigation
holds enforcement advantages within domestic frameworks, but enforcing judgments
internationally often encounters
substantial obstacles. Conversely, the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards
significantly streamlines the enforcement of arbitration awards, offering a
smoother process compared to litigation judgments. When
considering mediated
settlement agreements, enforcement predominantly operates on a voluntary basis,
with the inherent risk of parties
reneging on previously agreed-upon terms.

some extent alleviate enforcement challenges. For example, the SICC allows
parties to record settlements

makes the CICC more efficient in affirming mediation agreements than other
domestic legal proceedings since it negates the necessity
for parties to
individually seek court confirmation for their mediation agreements.
In addition to conciliation agreements, the CICC provides for the
transformation of a mediation settlement agreement into an official
judgment upon the parties’
This transformation
lends even greater enforceability to the agreement. As stipulated under the
Civil Procedure Law

However, a subtle complexity emerges when
differentiating between the issuance of a conciliation statement and a judgment.
Even though
a conciliation statement is endowed with the ‘same legal
effect as a judgment’,
pinpointing distinct practical differences between the two can be intricate.

capacity is enshrined in the foundational document of

whether the CICC has

such applications have simply
not been made. Furthermore, should the CICC engage
in processing an enforcement application, the exact procedural roadmap it would
adopt remains a matter of conjecture.
Unquantified
In addition to the tangible, direct and measurable impacts on efficiency and
finances, the choice of dispute resolution mode is significantly
influenced by
more intangible, subjective and perception-driven elements. These include
perceptions of fairness and impartiality,
as well as the preservation of
goodwill and business relationships, evidenced by significant empirical studies
and global surveys
on international dispute resolution, notably the Queen Mary
International Arbitration
and the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy
Moreover, the concept
of “opportunity cost” holds relevance in the decision-making
process; the cohesive and comprehensive
nature of one-stop shop models may
reduce the opportunity costs that arise when choosing, in particular, between
litigation and arbitration.
Like perceptions of fairness and the preservation of
goodwill, opportunity cost also involves a strong component of individual and
organisational judgment, influenced by personal, cultural, and contextual
This section explores how the CICC’s integrated
One-Stop Platform is strategically designed to address these subjective factors
effectively, thereby enhancing the decision-making process compared to
traditional, single-method dispute resolution mechanisms.

Preservation
of Business Relationship
The One-Stop Platform mechanism, in particular the pre-trial mediation
process, significantly enhances the potential for preserving
relationships among parties, a factor of paramount importance in commercial
disputants.
pre-trial mediation process serves to mitigate confrontations between parties,
and facilitating future
interactions.
summarised by Chris Guthrie and James Levine up to 1997 indicates that disputing
parties often report high levels of satisfaction
with mediation, which in turn
promotes adherence to mediation
agreements.
In practice, the
CICC has utilised its mediation procedures on several occasions, such as in
Guangdong Bencao Medicine Group Co Ltd v Bruschettini
demonstrating its
commitment to preserving business relationships through less confrontational
dispute resolution methods.
Furthermore, resolving disputes swiftly through mediation contributes to
reducing the backlog of pending litigation cases, thereby
safeguarding the
goodwill of publicly traded companies. According to art 19 of the
Law of the People’s Republic of China (2017 Amendment)
, items related
to pending legal proceedings must be disclosed in financial statements in
accordance with the state’s unified
accounting system. Speedy dispute
resolution through mediation can prevent adverse impacts on corporations’
credit ratings.
Especially for disputes exceeding 300 million yuan, often
involving listed companies in China, compliance with disclosure requirements
becomes crucial. As per art 80 of the
Law of the People’s Republic of China (2019 Revision)
and art 22 of
Measures for the Administration of Information Disclosure by Listed
Companies (2021 Revision)
, listed companies are mandated to disclose
significant events in line with relevant regulations.
It would be advisable for listed
companies to transparently disclose all litigation, mediation and arbitration
activities to mitigate
risk and maintain their reputational integrity.
This approach not only facilitates the swift and efficient resolution of
disputes but also underscores the benefits of the One-Stop
Platform mechanism in
preserving valuable business relationships, thereby contributing to a more
harmonious commercial environment.

In the domain of dispute resolution, various approaches offer distinct
benefits. However, due to the constraints of costs and jurisdictional
disputing parties typically are limited to selecting a single method. The
integration of litigation and alternative dispute

mechanisms can facilitate the resolution of disputes in a manner that is less
costly, more satisfying
and marked by reduced
bitterness.
Unlike traditional ADR processes, which operate on an ‘either/or’
the CICC One-Stop
Platform introduces a more nuanced and flexible approach. This flexibility
allows commercial disputants to navigate
between mediation and litigation with
greater ease, thereby minimising their opportunity costs associated with
choosing a dispute
settlement procedure. Such flexibility also enhances the
autonomy of parties in selecting and potentially switching between dispute
resolution mechanisms. As observed by the SICC, mediation grants parties a sense
of control over the resolution
By lowering the opportunity costs and granting disputants increased control
over their choice of dispute resolution paths, the likelihood
of achieving a
more amicable settlement is heightened. It also enhances the propensity among
parties to comply with the outcomes,
fostering a more cooperative environment.
However, it is important to acknowledge that the integration of arbitration
CICC’s revolving framework, especially when compared to
Singapore’s initiative, appears less compelling. Hence, the opportunity
cost concerns that arise when a party must choose between arbitration and
litigation remain somewhat unaddressed. This distinction
points to an area for
potential enhancement within the CICC’s model, which is discussed in
subsequent sections.
IV PROPOSAL
While the CICC’s One-Stop Platform showcases
many benefits, these advantages are derived both from its nature as a hybrid
institution
and the inclusion of a revolving system. This means that many benefits
associated with the One-Stop Platform are not unique to the
CICC; they are also
present in similar systems across different jurisdictions, such as those found
in Singapore. Further analysis
reveals that the One-Stop Platform of the CICC
has numerous limitations and, in some cases, faces substantial challenges.
Notably, the current
institutional framework of the CICC’s One-Stop Platform primarily
emphasises the linkage between litigation
and mediation, thus showcasing the
advantages of such integration. However, it does not fully exploit the potential
economic efficiencies
that could be gained from a more robust integration with
arbitration — both between arbitration and litigation, and between
mediation and arbitration. This deficiency limits the platform’s ability
to demonstrate the potential synergies and reduce
the transaction costs of
moving between these dispute resolution methods, consequently limiting its
functional interoperability with
other international courts and
To realise the
CICC’s vision of providing an integrated platform for international
commercial dispute resolution that amalgamates
these three methods, a more
elaborate set of norms and procedures needs to be developed.
Additionally, there is an urgent need to implement practical measures to
better align incentives across different dispute resolution
modes. Steps such as
increasing the volume of cases handled, upgrading technological capabilities and
enhancing the CICC’s
reputation are essential. These initiatives would
serve to reduce transaction costs and would strategically enhance the incentives

Arbitration in the Revolving Mechanism
The current mechanism facilitating transitions
between litigation and arbitration within the One-Stop Platform is found
lacking, potentially
diminishing its appeal to international parties who are
open to both arbitration and litigation. According to the
SPC Provisions
the CICC’s engagement with arbitration is largely confined to its

institutions recognised by the
This overall constrained approach suggests an underutilisation of principles
aimed at optimising legal frameworks to reduce transaction
costs and a failure
to cater adequately to the economic behaviours and preferences of international
disputants who may require more
flexible and responsive arbitration options.
First, international arbitration, while an
independent dispute resolution mechanism separate from litigation, primarily
remains governed
by national arbitration
Consequently, the domestic courts should play a critical role in supervising
arbitration processes, ensuring their smooth
However, the
CICC’s potential supervisory role over international arbitration is not
explicitly defined, reflecting economic
inefficiencies inherent in the system.
Without clear rules determining whether parties can turn to the CICC or must
seek assistance
from other domestic courts for arbitration-related matters (such
as appointments or termination of arbitrators), disputants face
logistical and financial burdens. These burdens include the economic costs
associated with engaging multiple courts for different
arbitration-related
issues and the inefficiencies resulting from a fragmented approach to
arbitration oversight.
In contrast, the SICC and the SIAC have introduced a jurisdiction model
clause that aids parties in selecting the SICC as the supervisory
international arbitrations seated in Singapore, which provides that any court
proceedings shall be heard or adjudicated
This stipulation,
compared to the CICC’s One-Stop Platform, not only provides parties with
the autonomy to choose the SICC
to oversee their Singapore-based international
arbitration cases but also enhances the SICC-SIAC model’s jurisdictional
and supervisory effectiveness. In light of this, the CICC should seek to
clarify its role in supporting arbitration with greater
specificity to improve
the efficacy and appeal of its One-Stop Platform.
Second, the existing limitations on support exclusively for designated
arbitration institutions limit the diversity of disputants
the platform can
serve and introduce higher transaction costs and inefficiencies in the
arbitration process. To enhance the platform’s
utility, the CICC should
consider expanding its network to include a broader array of internationally
renowned arbitration institutions.
Currently, the SPC has not specified the
criteria for recognising “qualified” international commercial
arbitration institutions.
Among the 10 third-party arbitration institutions
listed, nine of them are from Mainland China, with the Hong Kong International
Arbitration Centre (‘HKIAC’) being the sole institution from outside
Mainland China.
Strategically
broadening the network to include esteemed institutions from Singapore, Japan,
Korea and Malaysia would not only diversify
the options available to disputants
but also enhance economic efficiencies. Such an expansion would forge a robust,
collaborative
network across Asia, which could serve as a foundation for
extending the platform’s influence into other critical regions such
Middle East, Europe and the Americas. The broadened network would likely
facilitate the sharing of best practices and innovations
in arbitration across
different legal cultures, enhancing the overall quality and efficiency of the
dispute resolution services offered.
broader systemic challenges within the Chinese arbitration framework contribute
to inefficiencies in the CICC’s revolving
system between arbitration and
litigation. One significant aspect of this is the need to reform the ad hoc
arbitration mechanism
in China. Currently, arbitration law in China does not
recognise ad hoc arbitration, which imposes multi-faceted limitations on
effectively
integrating arbitration into the CICC’s One-Stop Platform. Ad
hoc arbitration offers significant benefits that can enhance
arbitration systems
across China, thereby naturally extending advantages to the One-Stop Platform.
Ad hoc arbitration is valued for
its cost efficiency, as it typically eliminates
the administrative fees associated with institutional
arbitration.
This makes it particularly advantageous for international commercial disputes
where cost minimisation is crucial. It also provides
greater flexibility in
procedural rules, allowing disputes to be tailored to the specific needs of the
parties involved,
leading to more customised handling of cases.
Beyond its inherent advantages that make it an attractive option in a general
manner, ad hoc arbitration could specifically augment
the capacities and
functionalities of the CICC’s One-Stop Platform. Currently, ICEC experts,
who are entitled to provide advice
on litigation and offer mediation services,
are restricted from engaging in ad hoc arbitration. Legalising ad hoc
arbitration would
then enable these experts to utilise their extensive
arbitration experience directly within the CICC’s framework. This will
expand the roles and utilisation of ICEC experts, making the platform more
comprehensive and attractive.
Once the CICC’s
One-Stop Platform expands its arbitration services beyond Mainland China and
Hong Kong, as suggested above,
and considering that ad hoc arbitration continues
to be recognised and embraced
the CICC must be
prepared for an increasing number of requests for cooperation and supervision in
ad hoc arbitration from a more
diverse international clientele. Meanwhile, ad
hoc arbitration, which often demands considerable efforts and cooperation from
parties throughout various stages of arbitration proceedings, may
necessitate more frequent judicial supervision and support. This
particularly pronounced if the parties engaged in an ad hoc arbitration lack a
cooperative relationship. Requests for cooperation
and supervision will require
China to adapt and enhance the CICC’s operational mechanisms to align with
global ad hoc arbitration
practices. This adaptation will involve significant
enhancements to the judicial support system to effectively manage the unique
demands of ad hoc proceedings. By successfully implementing these changes, the
CICC’s One-Stop Platform will be better positioned
to establish itself as
a true global leader in dispute resolution. Equipped to meet the evolving needs
of the international business
community, the platform will significantly elevate
its global stature and operational efficiency.
In a promising development, the Ministry of Justice of the People’s
Republic of China released a draft of the new

the Role of Mediation
its successful incorporation into the CICC’s One-Stop Platform and the
various benefits it offers — such as cost
savings, enhanced efficiency and
strategic advantages — mediation has yet to emerge as a stand-out feature
within the revolving
framework due to its conservative and traditional
implementation. While pre-trial mediation is clearly regulated, it remains
whether parties can opt for mediation at different stages of
litigation or pause ongoing arbitration to attempt mediation. Furthermore,
actual usage of mediation (successful or unsuccessful) within the CICC’s
One-Stop Platform is not well documented, and
no specific statements on
mediation outcomes have been released. Arguably, this cautious approach mirrors
the CICC’s inclination
towards exerting substantial control over dispute
resolution forums, limiting the flexibility of parties to customise their
Our analysis indicates that for the CICC to truly become a global nexus for
legal services aimed at a diverse international commercial
audience, a paradigm
shift is necessary. In line with principles from law and economics, the CICC
should adopt a more dynamic and
adaptable framework for mediation to maximise
efficiency and user satisfaction. One innovative approach is to offer parties
in the preservation of “conduct” and
“evidence” within the CICC an opportunity to utilise mediation
available through the One-Stop Platform. Implementing a flexible
approach where mediation is available at any stage of the dispute
process — regardless of the original mode or phase — would
effectively lower the opportunity costs for parties.
This strategy would promote
economic efficiency by minimising resources spent on prolonged conflicts and by
fostering quicker, mutually
beneficial resolutions. It also would address the
dilemma where parties, amid litigation or arbitration, wish to switch to
but find themselves unable to do so. Additionally, providing
continuous access to mediation options would serve as a powerful economic
incentive, encouraging parties to choose mediation as it aligns with their
strategic interests and reduces transactional costs. For
instance, once
litigation has begun, parties often gain a clearer understanding of each
other’s positions. At this juncture,
they may become more aware of the
costs associated with taking a case to judgment. Mediation can then assist them
in narrowing down
the contested issues that need judicial resolution. This shift
would better meet the diverse needs and objectives of disputing parties,
offering them a range of efficient, flexible and responsive resolution
What’s more, considering the rich historical
tradition of mediation in China, there is a compelling case for further
and maximising the use of mediation within the CICC framework.
Historically, mediation boasts extensive experience and a diverse
strategies from which the CICC stands to benefit significantly. Despite the
absence of a dedicated commercial mediation
law in China, the country’s
extensive history with mediation
— especially in fostering social stability — cannot be overlooked.
Judicial mediation, in particular, has been advocated
as a preferred method to
align with public sentiment, evidenced by the policy-driven increase in civil
cases resolved through
On one hand,
mandating parties to undergo mediation and setting benchmarks for successful
settlements for courts or judges in China
could potentially undermine the core
principles of voluntary participation, party autonomy and equitable treatment
within judicial
processes, thereby affecting the integrity and fairness of
dispute resolution. On the other, it is undeniable that China’s
people’s courts have developed a deep reservoir of knowledge, techniques
and skills in conducting mediation. This presents
the CICC with a unique
opportunity to harness this extensive experience, which would deliver
substantial benefits to parties considering
mediation. By conducting a thorough
analysis to identify the types of disputes most suited to mediation,
understanding the conditions
under which parties are more likely to choose
mediation and assessing the most effective stages for mediation within the
resolution process, the CICC can uncover crucial insights. This
exploration might, for instance, indicate that parties show a greater
to mediation either at the beginning of the dispute resolution process or as
they approach the issuance of a final judgment.
these insights, the CICC can craft specialised and actionable guidelines for its
One-Stop Platform, significantly enriching
the integration and effectiveness of
the mediation process. For example, it is crucial to ensure that comprehensive
guidelines and
data are readily accessible to the parties involved. These should
detail the types of disputes particularly well-suited for mediation,
considering
factors such as the nature of the dispute, the dynamics between the parties and
the complexity of the issues at hand.
Such a structured framework empowers
parties and their legal advisors to swiftly discern when mediation represents a
viable and effective
resolution pathway, therefore reducing transaction costs
and improving procedural efficiency. For instance, access to data on successful
mediation and cases and the characteristics of those cases enables parties to
better evaluate whether their dispute is likely to
be successfully mediated. If
successful, it not only saves significant economic costs — such as legal
fees initially allocated
for litigation or arbitration — but also enhances
business relationships. Through the provision of clear, data-driven guidance
the optimal application of mediation, the CICC stands to enhance the overall
efficiency and acceptance of mediation within its
dispute resolution ecosystem,
further solidifying the longstanding tradition of mediation practice in China
and aligning with economic
principles that minimise costs and optimise
Another aspect of practical guidance involves
establishing a panel of mediators who possess specialised expertise in areas
to commercial disputes. Currently, experts from the ICEC are
designated to mediate for litigants at the
Given that the ICEC
comprises a globally diverse group of experts, each with a rich background in
commercial dispute resolution,
this broad spectrum of expertise proves
invaluable, particularly in scenarios where a disputing party hails from the
same jurisdiction
as an ICEC expert. These experts possess a deep understanding
of their home jurisdiction’s commercial practices, principles
priorities, equipping them to identify and focus on the interests most crucial
to the parties involved. Their unique perspectives
can significantly enrich the
mediation process, steering outcomes more in line with the parties’
expectations and requirements.
Conversely, should the parties seek a
“neutral” mediator panel, the ICEC’s varied composition is
equally prepared
to accommodate such preferences, showcasing its versatility and
ability to align with diverse mediation needs.
However, the engagement of ICEC members remains
limited and their potential contributions are not fully leveraged. Therefore, it
recommended to create broader opportunities for these experts to actively
participate in case resolutions.
Strategic Initiatives
Beyond the aforementioned pivotal reforms proposed from a revolving
perspective, the CICC should implement some practical measures
— ones that
do not necessitate extensive legislative changes — to ensure the
effectiveness of its “revolving doors”
concept and that parties
truly reap the benefits of this One-Stop Platform system.
First, crucial to the
CICC’s success is transitioning from a theoretical framework to an
operational one. Despite being established
within domestic jurisdictions, the
international objective and functions of international commercial courts
necessitate significant
enhancements to fulfil their objective of being both
international and
operational.
Currently, the
CICC handles fewer cases than its counterparts in the Middle East and
and the revolving
feature of the One-Stop Platform remains underutilised. To move beyond its
status as a ‘general
framework’,
needs to enact concrete steps to enrich the CICC’s operations. As of the
time of writing, the CICC has issued only
nine judgments and rulings, providing
limited information to the public about the process of the proceedings and the
reliability
of the forum. As a recently established dispute resolution mechanism
with ambitious goals, this low level of operation poses a significant
to the understanding of potential disputants of the benefits it offers.
Given that the CICC’s jurisdiction encompasses both consensual and
non-consensual spheres,
approaches should be tailored accordingly. For consensual jurisdiction, the CICC
should consider publishing a “model clause”
for contracts,
advocating for the CICC and its One-Stop Platform as the chosen forum for
dispute resolution. Within this model clause,
the CICC could outline options for
parties regarding how they can transition between different dispute resolution
modes, thereby
reducing perceived opportunity costs and enhancing their
perception of fairness. Meanwhile, implementing this model clause would
significantly decrease the potential costs — financial, temporal and
human— associated with lengthy negotiations over
forum selection, and
would mitigate conflicts over jurisdiction, consequently streamlining the
initiation of proceedings and enhancing
the CICC’s reputation as a
professional and reliable forum.
As for non-consensual jurisdiction — which
includes referrals from higher people’s courts, cases with
‘nationwide
significance’ and those under the discretion of the
— the criteria and
standards remain vague. For instance, it is not well-defined for potential users
or lower courts, such as
intermediate people’s courts and higher
people’s courts, what constitutes “nationwide significance” or
a case should be transferred to the CICC. The process of transferring cases
from lower courts to the CICC, which involves various
changes such as altering
hearing locations and producing legal proceeding documents, significantly
increases transaction costs and
complicates the dispute resolution process,
potentially prolonging it. This ambiguity can deter potential users due to
risks and the unpredictability of outcomes, adversely affecting
perceptions of fairness and increasing both the duration and cost
resolution. The establishment of clear guidelines by the SPC would greatly
mitigate these uncertainties, streamline judicial
processes and enhance the
predictability and fairness of legal outcomes. By implementing the suggested
practical measures, the CICC
could become a more accessible and attractive forum
for a greater number of cases, increasing the size of its docket and ensuring
the Platform functions as intended. Such proactive measures would undoubtedly
solidify the CICC’s role as a dynamic and effective
centre for dispute
resolution.
second practical measure that warrants attention is the enhancement of the
technology, proximity and service quality of the CICC.
As observed, the CICC is
perceived as a secondary tier one-stop shop
, to some extent, an
‘artificial’ legal
failing to match the
service quality of more established centres. This is most apparent when
contrasting the CICC’s facilities
with the likes of Singapore’s
Maxwell Chambers, which unites major Singaporean and international dispute
resolution institutions
under one roof, capitalising on the ‘agglomeration
effect’ and reducing transaction costs for
branches in Shenzhen and Xi’an each face distinct challenges in evolving
into fully-fledged legal hubs. Xi’an
grapples with deeper issues of
insufficient legal infrastructure, services and culture, whereas Shenzhen, with
its nascent legal
infrastructure, has yet to achieve the comprehensive and
deliberate design of centres like Dubai, thus facing a more challenging
development.
To ameliorate this, the CICC should capitalise on Shenzhen’s strategic
location near Hong Kong, which is renowned as a robust
arbitration hub, and its
proximity to other cities in the Greater Bay Area (‘GBA’) that see
extensive business interactions
and a significant demand for legal services.
This geographical advantage could substantially enhance the CICC’s
offerings and
foster collaboration within the framework of the GBA initiative,
particularly through the One-Stop Platform. Moreover, as Hong Kong
verge of establishing a new international mediation
organisation,
development can be seen as an avenue to expand the “revolving doors”
concept, thereby strengthening the interplay
between the CICC and Hong
Kong’s extensive arbitration and mediation capabilities.
Incorporating advanced technology into the CICC’s operations represents
another avenue for elevating its global stature. The
adoption of artificial
intelligence for streamlined case management and secure document handling,
coupled with the implementation
of online dispute resolution tools, could
transform the CICC’s operational efficiency. By streamlining processes and
the need for physical document handling, the CICC can reduce the time
and cost associated with dispute resolution proceedings. This
enhancement would
not only bring greater convenience to disputants by simplifying interactions and
reducing procedural complexities
but also shorten the duration of proceedings.
Third, a strategic
approach towards enhancing promotion and building a solid reputation is
essential. Drawing inspiration from the
success of the SICC and various
international commercial courts in the Middle East, which have rapidly developed
and managed their
online presence, the CICC must enhance its digital footprint.
Currently, the benefits and functionalities of the CICC and its One-Stop
Platform are not sufficiently highlighted in the global legal arena, which may
contribute to higher transaction costs and decreased
user engagement due to
informational barriers. To effectively narrow this visibility gap, the CICC
could adopt a multifaceted promotional
strategy. This would involve developing a
user-friendly and richly informative website to articulate the CICC’s
value proposition,
showcasing technological advancements and procedural
innovations that set it apart. Furthermore, leveraging social media platforms
both Chinese and English could play a pivotal role in actively promoting the
activities of the One-Stop Platform. Through social
media, the CICC can
illuminate various aspects of its operations, including case highlights, legal
developments, the judge selection
processes, rulings and educational endeavours
like conferences and seminars.
Such promotional endeavours are crucial in bolstering the CICC’s
transparency and accessibility regarding case management, procedural
updates and
legal rulings. The call for increased transparency extends beyond academic
interests, impacting disputing parties, legal
professionals and the broader
public engaged with the CICC’s operations and outcomes. By adopting such a
comprehensive promotional
strategy, the CICC can significantly improve its
standing in the international legal community, demonstrating its dedication to
transparency,
accountability and accessibility.
V CONCLUSIONS
One-stop mechanisms and new legal hubs feature an
innovative approach to resolving cross-border commercial disputes through the
of litigation and non-litigation options for commercial disputants to
choose from. Various jurisdictions have established or are
considering the
establishment of their own one-stop shops, including Singapore, Dubai and China.
This paper has focused on the CICC
and its “revolving doors”
functions within its One-Stop Platform. Specifically, the CICC’s one-stop
mechanism is
designed to enable commercial disputants to select the most
suitable method for resolving their disputes efficiently, affordably
conveniently. Furthermore, this mechanism aims to enhance the facilitation of
the BRI, positioning China as a preferred legal
hub for international
This paper has employed a law and economics lens to assess the functionality
of the three dispute resolution methods within the CICC’s
Platform, focusing on economic costs, efficiency benefits and unquantified
elements. It has found that pre-trial mediation
and specific procedural features
contribute to lower economic expenses in international commercial courts.
Efficiency manifests in
designated timelines for the “revolving”
process, and robust enforcement of decisions from mediation, litigation and
adaptable procedural norms. Additionally, this analysis has illuminated parallel
unquantified benefits: enhanced perceptions of fairness
through the ICEC
experts’ involvement, preservation of business relationships by weaving
mediation into litigation and minimised
opportunity costs by affording parties
diverse resolution pathways.
While the One-Stop Platform offers the above benefits, these primarily arise
from its revolving system design, making many of its
advantages not exclusive to
the CICC but also observable in comparable frameworks in other jurisdictions
like Singapore. Closer scrutiny
of the CICC’s One-Stop Platform uncovers
various limitations and significant challenges. Specifically, we have argued
the current architecture of the One-Stop Platform is in its infancy,
especially due to the lack of transition between arbitration
and litigation and
inadequate linkage between mediation and litigation. Consequently, the
CICC’s One-Stop Platform fails to
capitalise on its potential distinct
advantages over similar mechanisms in other jurisdictions. This suggests the
necessity for systemic
reforms to effectively integrate arbitration into the
revolving mechanism and amplify the role of mediation.
To effectively integrate arbitration in the
“revolving system”, it is crucial to prioritise the enactment of
clear rules
that govern transition mechanisms and validate shifts between
arbitration and litigation. For instance, the legislation should explicitly
define the CICC’s supervisory role in assisting international arbitration.
Centralising arbitration-related judicial interactions
within the CICC’s
One-Stop Platform would eliminate the need to engage multiple courts and enhance
procedural efficiency and
predictability. This consolidation would reduce
transaction costs and establish the One-Stop Platform as a faster, more
cost-effective
dispute resolution forum. Reforming Chinese arbitration laws to
legalise ad hoc arbitration and then enhancing the CICC’s judicial
systems to effectively manage the unique demands of ad hoc arbitration are also
imperative. Such reforms would enable ICEC
members to engage in arbitration
within the One-Stop Platform, in addition to providing support in litigation and
mediation. This
would consequently enhance the Platform’s procedural
flexibility and operational capability, making it more comprehensive and
attractive. The CICC should further consider gradually expanding the
“qualified” institution list to include a broader
selection of
international arbitration centres. By incorporating esteemed arbitration bodies
from Singapore, Japan, Korea and Malaysia,
the CICC could establish a robust
collaborative network across Asia. Such a network would not only enhance the
efficacy and reach
of the CICC but also set the stage for future expansions into
other global regions, including the Middle East, Europe and the Americas,
thereby strengthening its international presence and capabilities.
Enhancing the role of mediation within the CICC is equally critical. An
innovative strategy is to introduce a flexible and adaptable
framework for
mediation to accommodate the diverse needs of parties at various stages of the
dispute resolution process. For instance,
the One-Stop Platform could be
enhanced to allow parties seeking to preserve “conduct” and
“evidence” to
access mediation services via the CICC’s
One-Stop Platform. Implementing such measures would not only refine the
doors” concept but also tailor the Platform’s
dispute resolution offerings to better meet user needs and preferences.
addition, leveraging China’s rich history of the use of mediation, the
CICC could offer clear, data-driven guidance on effective
mediation practices,
drawing from its wealth of experience. This would improve both the efficiency
and the acceptance of the process
within its dispute resolution framework,
reinforcing China’s long-established mediation tradition. The CICC can
further enhance
its mediation services by leveraging the global expertise of
ICEC members. Their wide-ranging knowledge is particularly beneficial
disputing party shares the same jurisdictional background as an ICEC expert, who
brings a deep understanding of local commercial
customs and legal principles.
This insight can greatly enrich the mediation process, ensuring outcomes that
align closely with the
parties’ expectations. Meanwhile, the ICEC’s
diverse composition allows for the assembly of “neutral” mediator
panels, offering flexibility to meet various preferences and ensuring the
mediation process caters to a broad spectrum of needs.
Finally, we have recommended further strategic
initiatives that could yield immediate impacts without necessitating major
legislative
reforms. These include urging the SPC to offer a model clause for
consensual jurisdiction and to provide clear guidance on non-consensual
from a theoretical “general framework”
to full operational status.
Integrating cutting-edge technology into the CICC’s operations emerges as
another key strategy
to boost its international profile and service quality.
Moreover, a comprehensive promotional approach to build a strong reputation
should be embraced, encompassing the creation of an accessible, informative
website and the strategic use of social media platforms
in both Chinese and
English to showcase case summaries, legal advancements, the judge selection
methodology, judgments, rulings and
scholarly activities such as conferences and
seminars. With these strategic improvements, the CICC is poised to more
effectively
realise its vision as a leading model for efficient and cohesive
dispute resolution globally.
