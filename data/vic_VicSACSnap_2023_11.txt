Sentencing Snapshot 283: Sentencing Trends for Sexual Penetration of a
Child Aged under 12 in the Higher Courts of Victoria 2017-18
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of sexual
penetration of a child aged under
in the County and Supreme Courts
of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2017-18 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on sexual penetration of a child aged under 12 and other
offences is available on
A person who takes part in an act of sexual penetration of a child aged under
12 is guilty of an indictable offence that carries a
maximum penalty of 25
years' imprisonment.
Sexual penetration of a child aged under 12 is a category 1 offence if it was
committed on or after 20 March 2017. For this offence,
this classification means
that courts must always impose a custodial
Sexual penetration of a
child aged under 12 is also a standard sentence offence if it was committed on
or after 1 February 2018.
This means that courts must take into account that a
prison sentence of 10 years represents the middle of the range of objective
seriousness for this offence.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where sexual penetration of a child aged under
12 was the principal offence, that is, cases where sexual
penetration of a child
aged under 12 was the offence that received the most severe
Sexual penetration of a child aged under 12 was the principal offence in 0.9%
of cases sentenced in the higher courts between 2017-18
and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings.
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 75 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of sexual penetration of a child aged

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.

a child aged under 12, 59 were eligible to have a non-parole

The offence of sexual
penetration of a child aged under 12 has changed over time. Prior to 17 March
2010, this offence was known
as 'sexual penetration of a child under the age of
Crimes Act 1958
s 45(2)(a))
and had a maximum penalty of
25 years' imprisonment. On 17 March 2010, the offence was renamed to 'sexual

transferred to

all three versions of this offence, provided

Data on first-instance
sentencing outcomes presented in this Snapshot was obtained from the Strategic
Analysis and Review Team at
Court Services Victoria. Data on appeal outcomes was
collected by the Sentencing Advisory Council from the
Australasian Legal Information Institute
was also provided by the Victorian Court of Appeal. The Sentencing Advisory
Council regularly undertakes extensive quality control
measures for current and
historical data. While every effort is made to ensure that the data analysed in
this Snapshot is accurate,
the data is subject to revision. The data does not
always specify whether the child was aged under 12 or aged 12 to under 16. In
order to determine the specific offence in those cases, the Council reviews
sentencing remarks. At the time of publication, sentencing
remarks for 12 of 362
cases (3.3% of cases) were unavailable or provided insufficient detail to
identify the age of the victim. These
cases have been excluded from both this
