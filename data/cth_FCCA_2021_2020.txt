EUGENE CHO PTY LTD
MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP, MIGRANT
SERVICES AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL
JUDGE LUCEV
DATE OF ORDER:
THE COURT ORDERS THAT:
1. Pursuant to
Migration Act 1958
(Cth) the time in
which to file the applicant’s originating application for judicial review
Migration Act 1958
(Cth) be extended to 18 February
2. The originating application filed 18 February 2020, as amended on 8
December 2020, be dismissed.
REASONS FOR
JUDGE LUCEV
INTRODUCTION
1 On 18 February 2020 the applicant, Eugene Cho Pty
Ltd (“Eugene Cho”) filed an application for an extension of time
(“Extension
of Time Application”) under
Migration Act
”) for the filing of
an application for judicial review (“ Judicial Review Application”)
Migration Act
On 8 December 2020 Eugene Cho filed an
Amended Judicial Review Application (“Amended Judicial Review
Application”) in
accordance with the Orders of a Registrar of this Court
dated 9 July 2020, 10 September 2020 and 26 November 2020
2 The first respondent, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant
Services and Multicultural Affairs (“Minister”),
does not oppose the
Extension of Time Application. In the circumstances, the Court is therefore
satisfied that it is in the interests
of the administration of justice to grant
the Extension of Time Application:
Migration Act
therefore be an order that the time for the filing of the Judicial Review
Application be extended to the time of filing
of the Extension of Time
Application, namely, 18 February 2020.
3 The Amended Judicial Review Application seeks review of a decision of the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal (“Tribunal Decision”
“Tribunal” respectively) made on 3 December 2019. The Tribunal
Decision affirmed a decision of a delegate (“Delegate’s
Decision” and “Delegate” respectively) of the Minister to
refuse Eugene Cho’s application for approval of
a nomination of a position
in Australia (“Employer Nomination”) under reg 5.19 of the
Migration Regulations 1994
Regulations
4 At the hearing of the Amended Judicial Review Application:
(a) the two volumes of the Court Book (“CB”)
were marked as Exhibits 1A and 1B respectively:
(b) the Explanatory Statement, Select Legislative Instrument No 242 of 2015 was
marked as Exhibit 2;
(c) the affidavits of:
(i) Michaela Jean Ganon sworn 19
November 2020 (“Ganon Affidavit”); and
(ii) In Ae Cho sworn 18 February 2020 (“Cho
Affidavit”),
5 The Tribunal Decision is in evidence at CB
AMENDED JUDICIAL REVIEW APPLICATION
6 The Amended Judicial Review Application contains
two grounds of review.
7 Ground 1 is as follows:
1. The Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by
misconstruing regulation
5.19(2)(aa)
Migration Regulations
(Cth) as requiring the Applicant to provide a written certification under
Migration Act 1958
time of application" of the nomination.
PARTICULARS
(1) Regulation
5.19(2)(aa)
in relation to a nomination application, that "
the application must ...
include a written certification
[under subsection
(2) The requirement in regulation
5.19(2)(aa)
may be satisfied at the
time of decision of the nomination, including the time of the Tribunal's
(3) Whist the Applicant did not provide the written certification at the time of
making the nomination application, the Applicant
did provide the written
certification prior to the Tribunal's decision (CB 1046).
(4) The Tribunal read into the words of regulation
5.19(2)(aa)
requirement that the inclusion of the written certification must be done at the
time of nomination application.
(5) As a result, the Tribunal incorrectly held that the "
application did not
include a written certification ... and therefore the requirement in r
5.19(30(a) [sic] is not met
' (Decision Record, paragraph 37) (CB 1079).
(6) By doing so, the Tribunal added an impermissible gloss to the words in
5.19(2)(aa)
(Emphasis in original)
8 Ground 2 was not pursued.

Section 245AR(1)
Migration Act
, specifically referred to in
reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
, provides that it is
contravened by a person asking for or receiving a benefit in return for the
occurrence of a sponsorship-related
is contravened the contravener commits an offence in relation to which a
civil penalty may be imposed:
Migration Act
, (4) and (5). In
Migration Act
“sponsorship-related event” is
defined, but it is not necessary to set out that definition for present
11 The relevant background up to the time of the
Tribunal Decision is as follows:
(a) Eugene Cho is a business trading as Yuki Japanese
Restaurant in Willeton, Western Australia: CB 76;
(b) the nominated person, Mr I Nengah Sutama Adi Wihendra, is a citizen of
Indonesia, currently residing in Western Australia, whose
spouse and three
children are listed as migrating family members included in the Employer
Nomination: CB 6-8;
(c) on 24 June 2016 Eugene Cho applied for the Employer Nomination: CB 1-9.
(d) on 24 June 2016 the Delegate caused a letter (“24 June 2016
Letter”) to be written to Eugene Cho: CB 11-17, which
included advice that
Eugene Cho “must complete and sign the attached mandatory Certification
form and attach a copy to your
ImmiAccount within seven (7) days”: CB 11;
(e) the form referred to in the 24 June 2016 letter is headed
“Certification Form – Paying for visa sponsorship”
requires the nominator to certify that have “engaged” or “not
engaged” “in conduct in relation
to this nomination that constitutes
a contravention of
subsection 245AR(1)
Migration Act
Section 245AR
Certificate”);
(f) Eugene Cho did not respond to the Delegate’
June 2016 letter;
(g) on 9 February 2017 the Delegate refused the Employer Nomination, finding
that Eugene Cho had not complied with the obligations
under Division 2.19 of the
Migration Regulations 1994
Regulations
relating to training requirements during Eugene
Cho’s most recent period as a standard business sponsor. The
Decision did not refer to the Section 245AR Certificate
requirement: CB 23-31;
(h) on 1 March 2017 Eugene Cho applied to the Tribunal for review of the
Delegate’s Decision to refuse the Employer Nomination:
(i) on 10 September 2019 the Tribunal sent Eugene Cho an invitation to provide
information concerning Eugene Cho’s compliance
with reg 5.19(2) and (3) of
Migration Regulations
, but the request to provide information did not
mention any requirement related to the Section 245AR Certificate: CB 81-86:
(j) on 26 September 2019 the Tribunal invited Eugene Cho to attend a hearing: CB
99-101 (“Tribunal Hearing”);
(k) on 4 October 2019 Eugene Cho responded to the invitation to attend the
Tribunal Hearing: CB 102-107;
(l) on 18 October 2019 Eugene Cho sent the Tribunal a number of documents
addressing the invitation to provide information: CB 111-1010;
(m) on 25 October 2019 representatives of Eugene Cho (including a migration
agent) attended the Tribunal Hearing. The Tribunal Hearing
was adjourned: CB
1076 at [5];
(n) on 28 October 2019 Eugene Cho sent an email to the Tribunal responding to
issues raised during the Tribunal Hearing: CB 1017-1021;
(o) on 31 October 2019 the Tribunal wrote to Eugene Cho advising that the
Tribunal Hearing would be resumed on 26 November
2019: CB 1027-1029.
November 2019, Eugene Cho responded to the invitation to attend: CB 1030-1032;
(p) on 20 November 2019 Eugene Cho provided the Tribunal with additional
submissions dated 20 November 2019, and supporting documents,
including a signed
Section 245AR Certificate dated 6 November
2019: CB 1033-1059
(q) on 26 November 2019 representatives of Eugene Cho (including a migration
agent) attended the resumed Tribunal Hearing: CB 1076
(r) on 27 November 2019 Eugene Cho provided the Tribunal with additional
submissions dated 26 November 2019 and supporting documents:
CB 1060-1071;
(s) on 3 December 2019 the Tribunal Decision affirmed the Delegate’s
Decision: CB 1073-1079.
TRIBUNAL DECISION
12 The Tribunal considered whether Eugene Cho met
the requirements for approval of the Employer Nomination under the Temporary
Transition nomination stream set out in reg 5.19(3) of the
Migration Regulations
, including, relevantly, that the Employer
Nomination be made in accordance with reg 5.19(2) of the
Regulations
(which is set out at [9] above)
13 In relation to reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
the requirement therein for an applicant to provide written certification
relating to conduct that contravenes
Migration Act
Tribunal found that:
(a) this was a time of application requirement; CB
1077-1078, Tribunal Decision at [18] and [23]; and
(b) it had no discretion in this matter, and because the application did not
include a written certification stating whether or not
Eugene Cho had engaged in
conduct in relation to the Employer Nomination that contravenes
Migration Act
, the requirement in reg 5.19(3)(a) of the
Regulations
to meet reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations
met: CB 1079, Tribunal Decision at [37].
14 The Tribunal, therefore, affirmed the Delegate’s Decision: CB 1079,
Tribunal Decision at [39].
SUBMISSIONS
15 It is unnecessary to set out in detail the
lengthy written and oral submissions of the parties. It suffices to observe that
the requirement in reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Regulations
for written certification stating whether or not Eugene Cho had
engaged in conduct in relation to the Employer Nomination that contravenes
Migration Act
(a) Eugene Cho submitted that this was not a time of
application requirement and that by finding that it was a time of application
requirement the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error; and
(b) the Minister submitted that this was a time of application requirement but
that in any event the requirement had not been complied
with by Eugene Cho, and
that there was no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal Decision.
CONSIDERATION
16 The principal issue for
determination is whether the requirement in reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Regulations
for written certification stating whether or not Eugene Cho had
engaged in conduct in relation to the Employer Nomination that contravenes
Migration Act
was or was not a time of application
requirement.
17 A possible secondary issue for determination is whether, in any event,
the requirement in reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
written certification stating whether or not Eugene Cho had engaged in conduct
in relation to the Employer Nomination that contravenes
Migration Act
had not been complied with by Eugene
The construction of delegated legislation
18 The general principles relating to the
interpretation of statutes apply also to the interpretation of delegated
legislation:

19 In interpreting a statute to determine its true meaning a court begins
with a consideration of the text, which must be read in
context and having
regard to the statutory purpose or object:
Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Territory Revenue (NT)
[2009] HCA 41
(2009) 239 CLR 27

(1997) 71 ALJR 312
; (1997) 141 ALR 618 (“
”), CLR at 408 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ.
The central task is to discern the meaning of the legislative text
effect to the identified purpose if it is one that is reasonably open on the
text. The interpretation best open on the text
which achieves the purpose or
object of the statute is to be preferred to each other interpretation (even if
the purpose or object
is not expressly stated in the text):
Interpretation Act 1901
Interpretation
CIC Insurance
, CLR at 408 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey and
Gummow JJ a majority of the High Court observed as follows:
It is well settled that at common law, apart from any
reliance upon
Acts Interpretation Act 1901
(Cth), the court
may have regard to reports of law reform bodies to ascertain the mischief which
a statute is intended to cure. Moreover,
the modern approach to statutory
interpretation (a) insists that the context be considered in the first instance,
not merely at some
later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise, and (b)
uses "context" in its widest sense to include such things as the existing
of the law and the mischief which, by legitimate means such as those just
mentioned, one may discern the statute was intended
to remedy. Instances of
general words in a statute being so constrained by their context are numerous.
In particular, as McHugh JA
pointed out in
Isherwood v Butler Pollnow Pty
, if the apparently plain words of a provision are read in the light of
the mischief which the statute was designed to overcome and
of the objects of
the legislation, they may wear a very different appearance. Further,
inconvenience or improbability of result may
assist the court in preferring to
the literal meaning an alternative construction which, by the steps identified
above, is reasonably
open and more closely conforms to the legislative
21 Section 15AA of the
Interpretation Act
provides as follows:
Interpretation best achieving Act’s purpose or object
In interpreting a provision of an Act, the interpretation that would best
achieve the purpose or object of the Act (whether or not
that purpose or object
is expressly stated in the Act) is to be preferred to each other
interpretation.
22 The provisions of s 15AB of the
Interpretation Act
permit the Court
to examine extrinsic material where the provision is ambiguous or obscure.
Section 15AB of the
Interpretation Act
provides as
15AB Use of extrinsic material in the
interpretation of an Act
(1) Subject to subsection (3), in the interpretation of a provision
of an Act, if any material not forming part of the Act is capable
of assisting
in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given
to that material:
(a) to confirm that the meaning of
the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision
taking into account
its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying
the Act; or
(b) to determine the meaning of the provision
(i) the provision is
ambiguous or obscure; or
(ii) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking
into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object
underlying the Act
leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is
unreasonable.
(2) Without limiting the generality of
subsection (1), the material that may be considered in accordance with that
subsection in
the interpretation of a provision of an Act
(a) all matters not forming part of
the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as
printed by the Government
(b) any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Law Reform Commission,
committee of inquiry or other similar body that was laid
before either House of
the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;
(c) any relevant report of a committee of the Parliament or of either
House of the Parliament that was made to the Parliament or
that House of the
Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;
(d) any treaty or other international agreement that is referred to in
(e) any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing the
provision, or any other relevant document, that was laid before,
or furnished to
the members of, either House of the Parliament by a Minister before the time
when the provision was enacted;
(f) the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the
occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that
the Bill containing the
provision be read a second time in that House;
(g) any document (whether or not a document to which a preceding
paragraph applies) that is declared by the Act to be a relevant
document for the
purposes of this section; and
(h) any relevant material in the Journals of the Senate, in the Votes and
Proceedings of the House of Representatives or in any
official record of debates
in the Parliament or either House of the
Parliament.
Construction of reg 5.19 of the
Migration Regulations
23 Plainly the purpose of reg 5.19 of the
Migration Regulations
(a) provide a mechanism for a person to apply to the
Minister for approval of the nomination of a position in Australia:
Regulations
, reg 5.19(1);
(b) set out the form and necessary content of the application:
Regulations
, reg 5.19(2)(a) and (aa);
(c) provide for a fee to be payable for the making of the application:
Migration Regulations
, reg 5.19(2)(b); and
(d) set out the criteria to be satisfied for the Minister to approve a
nomination:
Migration Regulations
, reg 5.19(3).
24 The chapeau to reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations
that “[t]he application must”. The use of “must” is
indicative of an imperative command: The Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary on
Historical Principles, Volume II (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), page 1376
(“Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary”), in this case, a positive
command, expressing necessity in the sense of an obligation to fulfil the
requirements
set out in the paragraphs (a), (aa) and (b) to reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations

Fisheries Management Authority v PW Adams Pty Ltd
(1995) 61 FCR 314
(1995) 134 ALR 51
(1995) 39 ALD 481
the Full Court of the Federal Court was dealing with fisheries management
legislation, and in particular, a provision which
provided that certain
“must be pursued by the Minister and the Authority in the
administration of the Act, ... and by the Authority in the performance
functions”.
Each of the five objectives was conjoined by the use of
the word “and”. The Full Court of the Federal Court held that
use of the word “must”, and the linking of each of the five
objectives with the word “and”, meant that
each objective must be
pursued by the Minister and by the Authority:
at 332 per Sheppard J
(with whom Tamberlin J at 334 and Lehane J at 336 agreed).
26 Recently, in
Minister for Home Affairs v Parata
[2021] FCAFC 46
”), the Full Court of the Federal Court was dealing
with a review of a cancellation decision under
, and in relation to
Migration Act
is relevantly in the following terms:
(1) An application for review of a
-reviewable
decision must:
(a) be made in the approved form; and
(b) be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period, ...
(c) be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any) ...
observed that it “specifies the requirements for an application for review
of the decision in mandatory terms”. Relevantly,
those provisions in
Migration Act
are not dissimilar to those in reg 5.19(2) of
Migration Regulations
27 It follows from the above
that the Court is of the view that the requirements in reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations
are mandatory, and must be met by an applicant.
28 None of the above assists, however, in determining the issue in these
proceedings as to whether the requirement in reg 5.19(2)(aa)
Regulations
for written certification stating whether or not Eugene Cho had
engaged in conduct in relation to the Employer Nomination that contravenes
Migration Act
was or was not a time of application
requirement, and it is necessary to further consider reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations
and its constituent parts in more detail.
Regulation 5.19(2)(a)
Migration Regulations
can only be
interpreted in one way: it requires that the “application must ... be made
in accordance” with the specified
“approved form”. There is no
other way, as the application can only be on the approved form, and that is
plainly something
that can only be done at the time the application is made. It
follows that reg 5.19(2)(a) of the
Migration Regulations
is a time of
application criteria.
30 Before considering reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
is convenient to consider reg 5.19(2)(b) of the
Migration Regulations
which requires that the application must be “accompanied by” the
necessary fee. The interpretation of reg 5.19(2)(b) of
Regulations
is important for the construction of reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations
as a whole. The Minister submitted that reg
5.19(2)(a) and (b) of the
Migration Regulations
were time of application
criteria and it, therefore, followed that it was the intention of the drafters
that reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
also be a time of
application criteria.
at [98] per Charlesworth and Jackson JJ the majority of
the Full Court of the Federal Court, dealing with
(as set out at [26] above), observed that:
The requirement that the application be
“accompanied by” the fee might be flexible enough to mean that the
application
and the fee need not be given to the Tribunal at the exact same
time: see the discussion in
Braganza v Minister for Immigration
and Multicultural Affairs
[2001] FCA 318
(2001) 109 FCR 364
– [58]. But it
must at least require that the fee be paid before the review is conducted; if
the fee is paid after the application
is determined, there is no meaningful
sense in which the application was “accompanied by” the
Braganza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
[2001] FCA 318
(2001) 109 FCR 364
(2001) 183 ALR 123
(2001) 65 ALD 95
”) at [56]-[58] per Wilcox, Weinberg and Stone JJ
the Full Court of the Federal Court allowed an appeal against a Migration
Tribunal decision. The Migration Review Tribunal decision had found that an
application for review accompanied by a request
for a fee waiver under the
Migration Regulations
was invalid because an applicant had not paid the
prescribed fee. In
the Full Court of the Federal Court at [52]
per Wilcox, Weinberg and Stone JJ said that particular regard had been had to
“if any” in
s 347(1)(c)
Migration Act
concluding, at [51] per Wilcox, Weinberg and Stone JJ, that;
... where an applicant for a visa makes an application
for a waiver of the prescribed fee in accordance with reg 4.13, and that
application
is made within the prescribed period, the application for review may
be entertained; provided that the fee is either eventually waived,
within a reasonable time after the application for waiver is rejected. That is,
s 347(1)(c)
should be read as being subject to the qualification that,
provided an application for a waiver of the fee has been made within the
prescribed period, the MRT is not prevented from considering the application for
review merely because the prescribed fee has not
been paid within the prescribed
the Full Court of the Federal Court at [53] per Wilcox,
Weinberg and Stone JJ also said that:
In our opinion
s 347(1)(c)
must be read in
conjunction with
s 504(1)(b)
of the Act. The legislature is hardly likely
to have introduced a provision which requires an application for review of an
MRT-reviewable
decision “to be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if
any)”, in conjunction with a provision which authorises the making
regulations which allow for the waiver of any such fee, without recognising that
applicants who seek waiver may not be in a position
to pay the fee, even on a
refundable basis, within the prescribed period.
Anand v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
(2013) 215 FCR 562
(2013) 136 ALD 633
application for a skilled sponsored visa had been refused because the
application was not accompanied by evidence of a
police clearance. The evidence
of a police clearance was required by cl 487.216 of Sch 2 to the
Regulations
at [11] per Katzmann J) provided as
487.21 Criteria to be satisfied at time of
application
487.216 The application is accompanied by evidence that:
(a) the applicant; and
(b) each person included in the application who is at least 16;
has applied for an Australian Federal Police check during the 12 months
immediately before the day when the application is
35 The argument in
, set out at [12] per Katzmann J, was
essentially the same as that in these proceedings:
In a nutshell the argument in the court below and in
this Court was that, despite the heading, the criterion need not be satisfied
the time of application and it would be unjust so to construe it. Rather, it is
sufficient compliance with cl 487.216 that the
relevant evidence is
supplied to either the Minister (or his or her delegate) in the first instance
or the tribunal on review at
any time before either makes a decision on the
application. The argument must be rejected.
the Federal Court observed that “accompanied”
is not defined in the
Migration Regulations
at [19] per
Katzmannn J (or, it might be added, the
Migration Act
(a) went on to say:
at [19] per Katzmannn
It is therefore necessary to look to the ordinary meaning of the word. The
Oxford English Dictionary defines “accompany”
- to be present or occur at the same time as;
- to add or join (a thing ... )
another; to supplement
(b) “[a]ccompanied by” could have either or both of the above
meanings, and it was necessary to have regard to matters
of context and purpose,
which included the heading to the relevant clause:
at [20]-[21] per
Katzmann J.
at [27]-[31] per Katzmann J the Federal Court set out its
reasoning and conclusions as follows:
27 It seems to me that the intention of the regulations
is to ensure that the application is not processed unless it meets certain
criteria. That is why the relevant evidence is to accompany the application.
Consistent with that purpose the evidence should be
submitted with or at the
same time as the application. Certainly that appears to be the object of the
provision. Yet, it is not
necessarily inconsistent with that purpose that the
evidence is submitted after the visa application is lodged, although how long
after is another question. There is force in Mr Karp’s submission
that there is some flexibility or elasticity in the phrase
“accompanied
by” (see, for example,
Kirk v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs
[1998] FCA 1174
(1998) 87 FCR 99
Winkler v Director of
Public Prosecutions
[1990] FCA 194
(1990) 25 FCR 79
at 96). It would seem that the
delegate had the same view. Why else send the letter of 10 June 2009 requesting
the evidence? In
this respect I think that both the tribunal and the federal
magistrate construed the words of cl 487.216 too narrowly. The next
question is what, if anything, turns on this error of construction.
What are the consequences of the error?
28 For the above reasons I am prepared to accept that evidence accompanying an
application could be supplied after the application
is lodged. Still, there
must be some temporal connection with the application. Evidence supplied around
the time of the application
may be sufficient. I doubt, for example, if the
accompanying evidence appeared in an annexure which through inadvertence had not
been uploaded or attached to the application but which was forwarded a day or so
later, that anyone would argue that the evidence
did not accompany the
application. It might even extend beyond that. Where, for example, an
applicant indicated in his application
or a document submitted with it that he
would forward the evidence within the week and he did so, it might be said that
the evidence
accompanied the application. But the words “accompanied
by” are not so elastic as to stretch to evidence submitted,
as here, five
months after the application was lodged and two days after the decision was
made. Language cannot be stretched so
far that it snaps (cf.
Removal Review Authority
[1993] 1 NZLR 73 at 79). In contrast to the
position in
the construction for which Mr Anand contended
would compromise the purpose of the regulations.
29 It is true that the tribunal “stands in the shoes” of the
Minister. But for present purposes that is beside the point.
The question is
not whether the evidence was provided to the Minister; it is whether it
accompanied the application. The federal
magistrate correctly found that
“application” in cl 487.216 meant the application for the
30 This construction is scarcely absurd, as Mr Karp contended. Nor is it
unfair, particularly when the Minister’s delegate
had drawn to
Mr Anand’s attention the deficiencies in his application and given
him a chance to rectify them. I have some
sympathy for Mr Anand. But his
predicament arose not from a misinterpretation of the regulations by the
delegate, the tribunal or
the federal magistrate, but in all likelihood from
errors and omissions on the part of his migration agent.
31 In these circumstances, despite the error in the interpretation of
cl 487.216, the appeal should be dismissed. It is well accepted

”) the Full Court of the Federal Court was
dealing with cl 485.223 of Sch 2 to the

evidence that the applicant had applied for”

Migration Regulations
considered by the Federal Court in

, it was observed in
at [14] per Tracey J
Her Honour took a benign view of the word
“accompanied”. The stretching of the concept may give rise to
difficulties
in determining how far a departure from the temporal requirement
may be permitted. There would seem to be no need to stretch the
concept, given
that an application for a visa may be delayed until the applicant has, in his or
her possession, evidence that the
skills assessment has been applied for.
Moreover, a visa application not accompanied by the evidence may be withdrawn
and a fresh
application made, once the evidence becomes
at [15]-[17] it was further observed by Tracey J (with whom
Charlesworth J at [28] and Derrington J at [33] agreed) that:
15 The clause establishes an objective temporal test.
Whether or not there is some flexibility in the test, nothing decided in
permits the temporal requirement to import notions of fairness so
as to avoid what might otherwise be an apparently harsh outcome
for the visa
applicant. The test does not turn upon concepts of blameworthiness or
deservedness. A visa application is either accompanied
by the necessary
evidence or it is not.
16 The test is objective. Clause 485.223 is one of a number of “time
of application” criteria conditioning the grant
of a skills visa. An
obvious mischief addressed by the provision is to provide clarity to the visa
applicant as to the person’s
readiness to apply for the visa and the
matters he or she needs to have done before he or she commences the visa
application process.
17 The provision aims to ensure that a person who applies for a visa has applied
for his or her skill assessment and is therefore
ready and willing to undergo
the assessment at the earliest opportunity. If the provision was not enacted in
that form, a visa applicant
might use the visa application process, including
processes associated with merits review by the Tribunal, to expand the time in
which he or she acquires the skills necessary to fulfil the substantive visa
criterion. In that way, the Regulations facilitate
efficient decision-making
and guard against delay by visa applicants who are not ready at the time of the
visa application to undergo
the necessary assessments.

“accompanied by” in cl 485.223 of Sch 2 to the
Regulations
referred to everything provided to the Tribunal up to the time
of the Tribunal decision. The argument was rejected, and at [14] per
Riethmuller in
Bussa – FCCA
this Court observed that:
The final argument was based upon an interpretation of
the words “accompanied by” with respect to the provision. In two
earlier single-Judge decisions, one by Katzmann J in
Anand v Minister for
Immigration & Citizenship
[2013] FCA 1050
(2013) 215 FCR 562
Burchardt J in
Nguyen v Minister for Immigration & Anor
[2016] FCCA
, their Honours both concluded that the term “accompanied by”
did not require the document to be provided together with
the application, and
that some flexibility was contemplated. This approach was not approved in
Khan’s Case
, which concluded that the clause required an objective
temporal test: see [14] of
Khan’s Case
. The period of time between
lodging the visa application and providing a properly-made application for a
skills assessment was far
too long to come within the terms “accompanied
by” even on the approach taken by Katzmann J and Burchardt
42 Bussa – FCCA
was appealed to the Federal Court. The appeal
was dismissed:
Bussa v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection
[2019] FCA 1994

evidence of a skills assessment applied for after the date of the application

Despite the unfortunateness of the appellant’s
situation, clause 485.223 essentially requires strict compliance. In
Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
[2013] FCA 1050

Katzmann J (at [28]) considered whether there might in appropriate
circumstances be a degree of elasticity to what is meant by
“accompanied”
in clause 485.223. In
, Tracey J (at [14]
and [15]) warned of the difficulties that could arise if the temporal
requirement that the applicant be accompanied
by the relevant evidence were to
be “stretched”. It is unnecessary for me to express any view on the
question of what,
if any, latitude there might be in relation to the temporal
requirement in clause 485.223, other than to say that there is nothing
clause which confers a general discretion to excuse a failure to provide
contemporaneously with the application evidence of
a relevant application for a
skills assessment.

Bussa – High Court
”) at [14] per Nettle J (footnotes
omitted) the High Court (constituted by a single judge), dismissing an
application by Mr
Bussa under s 75(v) of the
Constitution
observed that:
In any event, the application does not present an
arguable basis for the relief sought. Judge Riethmuller and Anastassiou J were
that the reasoning of the Full Court in
is determinative. In
contradistinction to provisions of the kind considered in Berenguel, which
direct attention to whether an applicant
“has” prescribed skills at
the time of application, cl 485.223 refers to whether the application itself
“was accompanied
by” prescribed evidence. As this Court indicated in
, the difference in terms reflects a difference in effect: that
criteria of the former, but
the latter, kind may be satisfied by
evidence provided to the Minister after the time of submitting the application
and considered
in accordance with
Migration Act
And, as Tracey J reasoned in
, the form of cl 485.223 is evidently to
ensure that an applicant for a visa has applied for a skills assessment and thus
demonstrated
a readiness and willingness to undergo the assessment at the
earliest opportunity. Were it otherwise, as Tracey J recognised, an
could delay acquiring the skills necessary to fulfil the substantive visa
criterion for so long as the visa application
and any merits review processes
were on foot. And, even then, the question of whether the plaintiff had acquired
a positive skills
assessment by the time of the judicial review proceedings
would be irrelevant.

44 The High Court in
Bussa – High Court
found that the
“accompanied by” criteria in cl 485.223 of Sch 2 to the
Regulations

at [51] below – is the same as the “accompanied by”

whilst the criteria in
could be satisfied at a time after the

“reflects a difference

(and also in

that “accompanied by” did not require filing of the accompanying

the view that
had stretched too far the meaning of
“accompanied by” in cl 485.223 of Sch 2 to the
Regulations
: at [14] per Tracey J, and that there was, rather, an objective
temporal test as to whether the visa application was accompanied
by the relevant
evidence “at the time of the visa application”: at [15]-[17] (the
quote is from [17]) per Tracey J.

in this matter when construing reg 5.19 of
Migration Regulations

(b) Tracey J at [26] rejected ground 2 for the reasons given by Charlesworth
(c) Derrington J at [33] agreed with the observations of Charlesworth J; and
(d) at [29]-[32] per Charlesworth J observed that:
29 The appellant relied on the decision of the High Court in the matter of
v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
264 ALR 417
[2010] HCA 8.
In that case, the High Court construed a regulation
setting out the criteria for the grant of a Subclass 885 visa. The relevant
regulation — which was premised with the heading “Time of
Application Criteria” — bore some similarity to
the regulation in
issue in the appellant’s case. At 421 [17] of the judgment the High Court
Division 885.2 sets out primary criteria. Under the heading “885.21
Criteria to be satisfied at time of application”
there appears the
885.213 Either:
(a) the applicant’s nominated skilled occupation is in Major Group IV in
the Australian Standard Classification of Occupation,
and the applicant has
vocational English; or
(b) the applicant has competent English.
30 The High Court continued:
By way of relevant contrast, clauses 885.214 and 885.215 require the applicant
to be accompanied by evidence of an Australian Federal
Police check and
arrangements that the applicant had made to undergo a medical examination.
There is no such requirement in respect
of proof of compliance with the
vocational English or competent English criterion.
31 The regulation at issue in the appellant’s case — that is, cl
485.223 — is not relevantly different from the
two provisions that were
contrasted by the High Court in that passage. The words “accompanied
by”, the High Court found,
at least implicitly, gave the necessary
grammatical connection to the words “time of visa criterion”. It
was that grammatical
connection that was missing in relation to the regulation
then under the Court’s consideration. It is for that reason that
consider the decision of the High Court in
assistance to the appellant and, in fact, presents the appellant with some
difficulty.
32 Nor does the decision in
set forth any principle to the
effect that considerations of fairness or absurdity are to govern the assessment
of whether or not
a temporal requirement exists between the making of an
application and the provision of evidence that a skills assessment had been
applied for. I would accordingly join in orders dismissing the
49 For the reasons given in
at [29]-[32] per Charlesworth J,
is distinguishable from reg 5.19(2) of the
Regulations
under consideration in this matter. That conclusion is
reinforced by the observations in
Bussa – High Court
and pointing to the distinctions between cl 485.223 of Sch 2 to the
Migration Regulations
– which is relevantly in not dissimilar terms
to reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations
– and the provisions of
Migration Regulations
under consideration in
were held not to be time of application criteria:
at [17]-[26]
per French, Gummow and Crennan JJ.
50 The above review of the cases concerning “accompanied by”
demonstrates that the most recent cases in the High Court,
the Full Court of the
Federal Court, the Federal Court (comprised of a single judge), and this Court,
dealing with not dissimilar
provisions in the
Migration Regulations
all taken the view that the phrase “accompanied by” in cl 485.223 of
Sch 2 to the
Migration Regulations
means that the criteria is a time of
application criteria.
cases all dealt with cl 485.223 of Sch 2
Migration Regulations
. It might be argued that that clause is
distinguishable from reg 5.19 of the
Migration Regulations
because the
clause has a heading indicating that it is a time of application criteria.
However, it appears that the heading to the
clause was not a decisive factor in
cases. Rather, it was the actual words used in
the clause construed in context which led the various federal courts in those
to the conclusion that the use of “accompanied by” meant that
the relevant criteria was a time of application criteria.
The reasoning in
cases is to be preferred, and therefore, for
the purposes of interpreting reg 5.19(2)(b) of the
Migration Regulations
that means that “accompanied by” is to be given the meaning
prescribed in
cases, with the result that reg
5.19(2)(b) of the
Migration Regulations
is a time of application
52 In the above circumstances the Court has concluded that “accompanied
by” in its ordinary meaning as it appears in reg
5.19(2)(b) of the
Migration Regulations
is a time of application criteria.
53 Returning then to reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
the requirement that the application “include” the “written
certification”, what is meant by “include”
in this context?
Does it mean include with the application at the time of application, or can it
be included later, that is, after
the application has been, and at any time up
to when the Tribunal decides?
54 The Oxford Dictionary Online: "include, v." OED Online. Oxford University
Press, June 2021. Web. 30 March 2021, provides multiple
definitions for
“include”, the most relevant in the present matter being:
II. To have, put in, or incorporate as part of a
55 The Macquarie Dictionary: "include" Macquarie Dictionary. Macquarie
Dictionary Publishers, 2021. Web. 30 March 2021, includes the
definition of “include”:
1. to contain, embrace, or comprise, as a whole does
parts or any part or element.
56 The Minister conceded that the word “include”, when used in
reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
, would be satisfied by an
Employer Nomination Application:
(a) which had the Section 245AR Certificate attached to
the Employer Nomination Application; or
(i) stated that the Section 245AR
Certificate was lodged as a separate document with the Employer Nomination
Application; and
(ii) in fact, was lodged with the Section 245AR Certificate.
57 In the context of the Minister’s argument, the concession does not
take the practical matters as to the manner of the filing
of the Section 245AR
Certificate outside of the time of application criteria because the manner of
the filing in each case involves
the Section 245AR Certificate being included as
part of the whole in the making of the application.
58 In contemplating the intention of the drafters it is relevant to consider
what distinction, if any, was intended by the use of
the expression
“include” rather than “accompanied by”.
59 In context, a meaning consistent with the Section 245AR Certificate being
included as a part of the whole, that is as part of the
application as a whole
at the time of application, is entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of
“include”. The
Court also agrees with the Minister’s
submission that “include” is narrower in scope than the words
“accompanied
by”. In that regard “include” has a greater
quality of definitiveness and sense of inclusion than the phrase
“accompanied
by”. It follows that the construction to be given to
reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
ought not be broader than
that given to reg 5.19(2)(b) of the
Migration Regulations
, and therefore
it is appropriate, having regard to that narrower meaning of
“include”, and to the rationale in
cases, to conclude that “include” in reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
is a time of application criteria.
60 The Court has also examined the Explanatory Statement, Select Legislative
Instrument No. 242, 2015 (“Explanatory Statement”)
as it pertains to
reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
to which it was referred by
the parties. The relevant section of the Explanatory Statement is as

of the Regulations.
Regulation 5.19
provides for the process of applying to the Minister for
approval of the nomination of a position in Australia, and the requirements
must be met for the Minister to approve such a nomination.
Regulation 5.19
relevant to nominations for the Temporary Residence Transition Stream and the
Direct Entry Stream of the Subclass 186 visa and
Subclass 187 visa.
New paragraph 5.19(2)(aa) provides that the application must include a written
certification by the nominator stating whether or
not the nominator has engaged
in conduct, in relation to the nomination, that constitutes a contravention of
subsection 245AR(1)
Migration Act
The effect of this amendment is that the Minister cannot approve the nomination
unless, amongst other things, the person applying
for approval of nomination has
provided a written certification to the Minister regarding whether or not the
person has engaged in
conduct that constitutes a contravention of
Migration Act
, in relation to the nomination to which they are
seeking approval. The events that are relevant to determining whether or not the
conduct constitutes a contravention of
subsection 245AR(1)
Migration Act
for the purposes of the certification are paragraphs (g) and (h) of the
definition of
sponsorship-related events
section 245AQ
Migration Act
The particular events relevant for the purposes of a certification under
regulation 5.19 are different from a certification under
regulation 2.72
regulation 2.72A because a nomination under regulation 5.19 is not made under
section 140GB
Migration Act
In effect, the person applying for nomination approval will be required to
certify, in writing, whether or not they have asked for,
or received, a
(within the meaning of
section 245AQ
Migration Act
from another person in return for applying for approval of the nomination
currently being progressed, or not withdrawing the nomination
currently being
progressed. The requirement to provide a certification is applicable to
nominations in relation to the Temporary
Residence Transition stream and the
Direct Entry stream of Subclasses 186 187.
The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the person applying for
nomination approval provides the certification before a nomination
is approved.
Depending on the information provided on the certification, further action may
be taken to investigate the person making
the nomination in relation to a
possible breach of
subsection 245AR(1)
Migration Act
. This requirement
also makes a person making a nomination aware that the
Migration Act
prohibits a
person from engaging in the conduct that contravenes
subsection 245AR(1)
Migration Act
61 The phrase “[t]he purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the
person applying for nomination approval provides the certification
nomination is approved” in the last paragraph of the above quotation from
the Explanatory Statement might, at first
blush, seem to suggest that the
provision of the
Section 245AR
Certificate is not a time of application criteria
and that there is a degree of flexibility that indicates that the
Section 245AR
Certificate may be provided at a time prior to a Tribunal decision. This
construction however places too much emphasis on the words
nomination is approved” and divorces them from not only the ordinary
meaning of “include”, as set
out at [54]-[55] above, in reg
5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
, but it also fails to appreciate
the meaning to be given to reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
when reading the relevant paragraphs of the Explanatory Statement as a whole.
62 When at paragraph 2 of the Explanatory Statement it is said that reg 5.19
Migration Regulations
“provides the process of applying to
the Minister for approval of the Nomination ..., and the requirements that must
for the Minister to approve such a nomination” it is evident that
two separate matters are being dealt with, namely the:
(a) process of applying; and
(b) requirements to be met for approval.
63 These two matters fit neatly with:
(a) reg 5.19(2) of the
Migration Regulations
relation to the process of applying; and
(b) reg 5.19(3) of the
Migration Regulations
in relation to the
requirements to be met for approval.
64 From the outset therefore the structure of reg 5.19(2) of the
Regulations
as set out in the Explanatory Statement is consistent with it
relating to matters to be met in the process of applying for a visa,
and not the
fulfilment of subsequent requirements. This bifurcation between the process of
applying and meeting the requirements
is reinforced by the text of the last two
paragraphs of the Explanatory Statement where it provides that the effect of reg
Migration Regulations
is that “the person applying
for nomination approval will be required to certify in writing, ... in return
for applying for
approval of the nomination currently being progressed”,
and for further investigative action to be taken to investigate any
Migration Act
. In the overall context of the
structure of reg 5.19(2), and in particular paragraph (aa), of the
Regulations
, the phrase “provides the certification before a
nomination is approved” is apt to describe, and does describe, part
time of application criteria which requires the filing of the Section 245AR
Certificate, and which, axiomatically, is therefore
to be done before the
relevant nomination is approved.
65 The fact that the filing of the Section 245AR Certificate is a part of the
time of application criteria in reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Regulations
is reinforced by the provisions of reg 5.19(3)(g) and (h) of the
Migration Regulations
relating to adverse information and the nominator
having a satisfactory record of compliance with relevant laws, matters which
and practically from an administrative viewpoint ought to follow the
giving of the Section 245AR Certificate, as appears to be the
intention of reg
5.19(2)(aa) and (3)(g) and (h) of the
Migration Regulations
together. Leaving the filing of the Section 245AR Certificate to an
indeterminate time following the time of the making
of the application gives
rise to the type of administrative difficulties adverted to in
[17] per Tracey J, as to which see [40] above.
In practical terms the
problem with reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
not being a
time of application criteria is that if an applicant can go through the entire
application process up to the time immediately
before a relevant administrative
decision is to be made, and then provides an adverse Section 245AR Certificate,
that leaves the
visa application process open to manipulation, as well as
resulting in a significant waste of public resources and time:
[17] per Tracey J.
As to the suggestion in the applicant’s
submissions that an applicant could engage in conduct in contravention of
Migration Act
after lodging the application and having
certified that no such conduct had occurred, and still be granted the nomination
other criteria were met - which would clearly be against the aims of the
legislation - the Court observes that reg 5.19(3)(g) and
Regulations
are plainly intended to deal with any adverse conduct after the
time of application.
66 Both parties referred to
Aomatsu v Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs
[2005] FCAFC 139
(2005) 146 FCR 58
(2005) 219 ALR 611
; (2005) 86 ALD 56 (“
”) wherein the
Full Court of the Federal Court considered whether an occupation nominated on an
application had to be assessed
by reference to skilled occupations specified in
a Gazette Notice at the time of application or at the time of decision.
involved a matter where an occupation had been removed from a
list of “migration occupations in demand” for which points
awarded after the making of the application, and in regard to which the Minister
had not therefore awarded points to an applicant.
thus involved a
quasi-legislative change of criteria after the application was made. The
majority in
held that whether an occupation was a migration
occupation in demand was to be determined by reference to the Gazette Notice in
at the time of application:
at [28] per Moore J and [53]
per Gyles J.
is plainly distinguishable from this matter on the
facts as it involved a change in criteria after the time of application, but in
any event, it does not assist Eugene Cho’s argument as the majority of the
Full Court of the Federal Court determined there
was a time of application
requirement.
67 Eugene Cho also referred the Court to decisions of the Tribunal in
different matters, but they were of no real assistance to the
Court in the
interpretation of reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
68 For all of the above reasons, the Court is of the view that reg
5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
sets out time of application
criteria. It follows that the Tribunal Decision that the requirements in reg
5.19(3) of the
Migration Regulations
, which included the requirement that
the application be made in accordance with reg 5.19(2) of the
Regulations
, had not been met: CB 1079, Tribunal Decision at [37]-[38], was
open to it, and was correct. It follows that ground 1 is not made
out and that
the Tribunal Decision was not affected by jurisdictional error.
Written certification concerning conduct in contravening
Migration Act
69 Strictly speaking, the secondary issue for
determination, being whether the requirement in reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
for written certification stating whether or not
Eugene Cho had engaged in conduct in relation to the Employer Nomination that
contravenes
Migration Act
had not, been
complied with by Eugene Cho, does not arise because the time of application
criteria was not met by either:
(a) the purported
Section 245AR
Certificate provided to
the Tribunal dated 26 November
2019: CB 1046
(“November 2019
Certificate”); or
(b) in a letter provided to the Tribunal dated 26 November
2019: CB 1064-1065
2019 Letter”).
However, given the submissions made by the parties, it is appropriate to make a
few observations.
70 In the November 2019 Certificate, both boxes
were ticked regarding whether the conduct had, or had not, been engaged in. The
are ticked by Ms Cho in her capacity as a director of Eugene Cho: CB 1046.
71 The first box ticked relates to the text adjacent to the box which
I certify that I have engaged in conduct in relation to
this nomination that constitutes a contravention of
subsection 245AR(1)
Migration Act
72 The second box ticked relates to the text adjacent to the box which
I certify that I have not engaged in conduct in relation
to this nomination that constitutes a contravention of
subsection 245AR(1)
Migration Act
73 Plainly the ticking of both boxes does not meet the requirement in reg
5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
that the application must
“include a written certification by the nominator stating whether or not
the nominator has engaged
in conduct, in relation to the nomination, that
constitutes a contravention of subsection 245AR(1) of the Act”.
Ticking both
boxes constitutes a wholly ambiguous statement that Eugene Cho has
and has not engaged in conduct in contravention of
Migration Act
, and is not a “whether or not” statement as to
the relevant conduct as required by reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Regulations
. Thus, had the November 2019 Certificate been submitted in the
same form at the time of application, it would not have met the requirements
reg 5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
74 In the two-page November 2019 Letter, Ms Cho writes at CB 1065 as
I can declare that as a company we have always complied
Migration Act
Section 245
, despite not providing
the actual signed form at the time of lodgment. We have never violated this
section and will never do so.

”) at [84] and [86]-[87] per Judge Lucev the
Court, with respect to the phrase “certify in writing”, observed
84. To “certify” relevantly means “to
testify to or vouch for in writing”: Macquarie Dictionary (7th Edn)
(Sydney: Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, 2017), page 255 (“Macquarie
Dictionary”).
86. The meaning of the phrase “certify in
writing” may however be affected by
Interpretation Act 1984
Interpretation Act
”) which provides the following
definition of “writing”:
and expressions
referring to writing include printing, photography, photocopying, lithography,
representing or reproducing words in visible
87. The definition of “writing” set out
above is very broad, and is an inclusive definition, not an exclusive one.
Relevantly,
the word “writing” means:
That which is written; characters or
matter written with a pen or the like
handwriting
any written or printed paper, document, or the like.
Macquarie Dictionary, page
76 Section 2B of the
Interpretation Act
defines “writing”
as follows:
Includes any mode of representing or reproducing words,
figures, drawings or symbols in a visible form
77 The Court considers that there is no reason to adopt any different
approach to the meaning of the phrase “written certification”
that of “certify in writing” adopted in
Lavan Legal
out at [75] above. In the Court’s view absent the specification of a
particular form on which a written certification
is to be made, either by
legislation (see, for example, reg 5.19(1) of the
Migration Regulations
or by lawful declaration by the Minister or the Minister’s delegate,
there is no reason why the “written certification”
required by reg
5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
cannot be provided in writing
in a letter such as the November 2019 Letter, filed at the time of making the
application.
78 In any event, because the Court has already determined that reg
5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
is a time of application
requirement neither the November 2019 Certificate nor the November 2019 Letter
provide a basis for finding
79 Due to the Court’s determination that reg
5.19(2)(aa) of the
Migration Regulations
is a time of application
requirement it is unnecessary to consider the futility argument raised by the
CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
80 The Court has
concluded that:
(a) it is in the interests of the administration of
justice to grant the Extension of Time Application; and
(b) there is no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal

(a) the time for the filing of the Judicial Review
Application be extended to the time of filing of the Extension of Time
Application,
namely, 18 February 2020; and
(b) the Judicial Review Application filed 18 February 2020, as amended on 8
December 2020, be dismissed.
