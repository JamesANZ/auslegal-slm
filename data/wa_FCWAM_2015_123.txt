WORDS IN SQUARE BRACKETS REPLACE WORDS USED IN
THE ORIGINAL JUDGMENT - PARTIES’ NAMES AND IDENTIFYING DETAILS HAVE BEEN
1 On 20 January 2015 the wife
filed a fresh Form 1 application seeking to revisit orders in relation to child
welfare issues. By
way of a response filed 4 March 2015, the husband seeks a
range of parenting orders. At the hearing before me on 11 March 2015,
the parties who were both representing themselves, that I considered it
appropriate to consider the principle or the rule
Rice & Asplund
[1978] FamCAFC 128
(1979) FLC 90-725
and therefore adjourned the proceedings. In order to
assist the parties I provided each of them with a copy of
Rice & Asplund
by way of letter dated 16 March 2015. The hearing proceeded on 10 June
2015. Despite seeking numerous orders, the father’s
position at the
hearing before me was clear; he did not seek to vary the current orders because,
in the circumstances, his submission
was that the mother’s application
should be dismissed given that there was no sufficient change in circumstances.
He accepted,
upon my questioning, that he could not “have his cake
and eat it too” by seeking to dismiss the mother’s application
whilst proceeding with his own.
2 The earlier proceedings started by the wife filing a Form 1 application on
5 August 2010. The husband’s response was filed
on 4 October 2010
and the wife amended her application on 29 November 2011. Those proceedings
were finalised by way of a trial that
took place over four days in July and
August 2012. Her Honour Boland AJ delivered judgment on 28 November 2012.
3 In summary, her Honour ordered that the father have sole parental
responsibility for the children, [Child A] born [in] 1997, [Child
B] born [in]
1998 and [Child C] born [in] 2002. Her Honour also ordered that the children
attend on a counsellor at Relationships
Australia in order to explain the
reasons for the orders made and the effect of the orders. The children were
then to attend a supervised
visit with the mother at Relationships Australia
“for the purpose of the applicant apologising to the children about events
occurring at the time of the parties’ separation”. Any further time
between Child A and Child B and the mother were
to be in accordance with their
wishes. Subject to compliance with earlier orders, Child C was to spend time
with the mother for
not less than two hours each alternate week on either a
Saturday or Sunday for six months and, following compliance with that time,
time was to be extended. The mother’s time with Child C was conditional
upon or subject to various other things happening.
Just over two years later
the wife filed her fresh application. It seeks a number of orders on a final
basis, some of which are
entirely inappropriate:
have access to my youngest child – [Child C] – by way of regular
Visitation [sic].
have full access to the children’s schools – when the children are
at school – where necessary.
be informed when the children’s circumstances change; go on holidays
– overseas; change schools; move house –
up until the age of 18
have counselling set up with [Child C] – with a court registered child
therapist – all costs paid by the father.
the mother cannot see any of her children – owing to the father and his
family estrangement of her; I should like these orders
to be put in place;
children to have full access to all the Court Records once they attain the age
of 18 years – the Court Records will be made
available to the children
should they wish to access them within their lifetimes.
father, [Mr Nowell], to write a detailed Rational [sic] to explain to the mother
why he believes that the mother should have no
involvement in the
children’s lives – This Rationale will be stored in the Court
Nowell Snr] (the father of [Mr Nowell]) and [Mrs N Nowell] (the mother of [Mr
Nowell]) to write a detailed Rational [sic] to explain
to the mother why they
believe that the mother should have no involvement in the children’s
lives. This Rationale will be
stored in the Court Records.
F Nowell] (the sister of [Mr Nowell]) to write a detailed Rational [sic] to
explain to the mother why she believes that the mother
should have no
involvement in the children’s lives. The Rationale will be stored in
the Court Reords [sic].
4 It should be obvious that the Court has
no intention of making any orders that provide for the father, his parents or
to write any type of explanation to the mother. As this matter went
to trial and various affidavits were relied upon, it was the
decision that imposed the various orders referred to above and there is no
reasonable purpose in requiring either the
father or any other third parties to
explain their position to the mother. Their positions should be well and truly
clear in previous
affidavit material.
5 Each party relied upon a case information affidavit and were provided an
opportunity to make submissions to the Court at the hearing
on 10 June 2015,
noting that they had previously received a copy of the decision in
. With no disrespect intended to either party, neither made any
significant submission and effectively relied on their material.
The record of
proceedings will show that the proceedings lasted approximately 12 minutes.
Notwithstanding that, this Court has
an obligation to carefully consider the
evidence and the circumstances of this case as to whether there has been a
change in circumstances
that is sufficient to justify relitigating over similar
issues and putting the parties and the children through further Court
proceedings.
6 This matter involves a consideration of the “rule” in
. This decision has evolved into a longstanding principle
in which the Court must firstly consider whether the principle is to be
considered on a preliminary basis or one after a detailed investigation. In
addition, the Court must, in considering such a principle,
still take into
account the best interests of children and the various provisions such as the
objects and principles of the Act in
coming to its determination (see the views
of Warnick J in
[2008] FamCAFC 16
(2008) FLC 93-363
and [65]). As
Warnick J said at [81] in
Thus, in my view, when the threshold question described in
is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination
“on the merits”. Where an application is dismissed
at a preliminary
stage, it is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of the
party to appear or some lack of
compliance with form and procedure, but rather
because, assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an
insufficient
change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing.
Though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will, or ought
the interests of the child in not being subjected to further litigation, is more
powerfully in the child’s welfare,
than to allow the application to
7 It is clear that the Court must, if determining the matter at a
preliminary stage, take the applicant’s case at its highest
and proceed on
the basis that the evidence produced by the applicant is correct. This view is
also supported by the Full Court in
Poisat & Poisat

preliminary basis.

principle is that there must be a sufficient
change in circumstances between the making of final orders in relation to
issues and the filing of fresh proceedings.

[2008] FamCAFC 150
, the Full Court
considered an appeal by the mother against orders made by Barry J to
dismiss her fresh application on the basis of
the rule in
. At the original trial, Buckley J found, amongst other things,
and this is set out at [106] of the Full Court decision, that:
the mother was
unable to facilitate a positive relationship between the children and the
the mother was
of the view that the children should choose for themselves whether they see
their father or not and, for example, had
told the children in the waiting room
of the report writer that they did not have to see their father if they elected
each child had
indicated to the report writer that they did not wish to see their father;
the mother had
“over exposed” the children to the dispute. The elder child
made it clear she did not want any contact
with the father;
the children
have been unduly and negatively influenced by the mother and she was unable to
facilitate a relationship between the
children and the father while they resided
if the children
were placed with the father they would experience emotional and behavioural
difficulties in the short term as they
learned to adjust;
if the children
did not reside with the father, contact orders would be ineffectual; and
eventuality, the relationship between the father and the children would further
deteriorate.
11 The Full Court accepted that taking the
mother’s case at its highest, the asserted changes of circumstances
appeared to
be [at 110] that:
the father and
his family denigrated the mother to the children which had caused the elder
child to leave the father’s care
(a matter which Mr Page SC described
before Barry J as “the most important” of the changes that had
occurred since Buckley
J’s judgment.);
the mother had
given birth to a child and a relationship had developed between the children and
that child and separation from that
child was “a source of some
the children
left the father’s residence “unaided by either of their
parents” and had chosen to “go back into
that action was
an indication of the stress the children were under;
the children
were now aged 14 and 11 (as opposed to 12 and nine before Buckley J).
12 In those circumstances, the Full Court found that the matters
said to be changes on behalf of the mother were in fact [at 116]:
manifestations of the fact that the central matters found
by Buckley J including the antipathy of the children toward
their father,
the difficulties his Honour would exist for the children on a
change in their residential care, the inability of the mother to promote
foster a relationship between the children and their father and the influence of
the mother’s attitudes on the wishes of
the children – continued to
13 In those circumstances the appeal by the mother was dismissed.
14 These principles were recently followed in the Full Court decision of

that the trial Judge [at 25] recorded that the “rule” in

The Full Court acknowledged
that his Honour correctly accepted that the mother’s evidence should be
taken at its highest and
that the “threshold question” enunciated in
Rice & Asplund
is determined as a preliminary matter, and on the
merits. His Honour also made it clear that he would assume that the evidence of
the mother is accepted in order to assess whether there was a sufficient change
of circumstances to justify embarking on a hearing.
15 His Honour referred to the above-mentioned quote by Warnick J in
The facts of this case
16 It is clear, given the above, that I must take the mother’s
evidence at its highest in order to determine on a preliminary
basis whether she
should be allowed to continue with her application. It should be remembered
that the two eldest children are 18
and 16 respectively, and in any event, the
mother only seeks orders in relation to the youngest child, Child C, who is
13 years old.
17 The changes in circumstances alleged by the mother appear to be as
the father has breached the Court orders on regular occasions since they were
made or that the orders have not been successful
in ensuring that any of the
children have an ongoing relationship with her.
says that “all attempts of supervised access have failed”.
18 It is necessary to refer to the reasons for decision of
Boland AJ to see whether these issues were before the Court at the time
whether anything has changed significantly since. Whilst I have taken into
account the entire reasons for decision comprising
35 pages, I highlight the
[3] It is not in dispute that the mother’s contact to the children was
suspended as a result of interim orders made on 23 May
2011, and that she has
not seen the children since that date. [Child A] and [Child B] have told the
single expert appointed in this
matter that they do not wish to spend any time
with their mother, at least for the present time. [Child C] has also expressed
view along similar lines to those of his elder brothers.
[4] It is the mother’s case that the children are estranged from her
because of the father and his parents’ conduct.
[I have ignored the
various statements of the views of the elder two children as they are not
referred to in the mother’s application
before the Court.]
[49] Ms Johnstone explained that [Child C] was aged 9 at the time of the
interview and that he presented as a polite, albeit slightly
nervous child when
being interviewed. [Child C] confirmed that he had written matters about the
mother on a piece of paper because
it was [Child A’s] idea. [Child C] was
noted to express the view he was confused and sad when his mother left, although
went on to say he did not miss the mother after she left, or even before she
left. Like his brothers, [Child C] expressed the view
he liked living with them
and he would like to live with them and their father.
[57] Ms Johnstone also commented on drawings done by the children.
She noted that they disclosed “underlying feelings of anger
aggression”. She noted that when the children were asked to draw a family
picture, they asked if they had to include the
mother and that only [Child C]
included a mother figure in his drawing. Ms Johnstone noted the children could
only relate positive
aspects of their father’s parenting and were unable
to identify any positive traits of their mother.
19 At [64] her Honour noted that the single expert recommended that:
while residing with their father, there should be a reunification of the
children to reside with their mother in a shared care basis
with review by the
Court in the near future. In order to facilitate reunification with the mother,
Ms Johnstone recommended individual
counselling and a parenting course for the
mother, and for time to be spent with her in a “parent [semble
Children’s]
family therapy with their mother.
20 At [65]:
In support of her recommendation for supervised time with the mother,
Ms Johnstone opined “There is a high possibility that
the children
would resist the contact, however, if contact was stipulated as court orders,
the children
may hopefully
realize that their mother had persisted in her
effort to maintain contact with them only for one reason is that she loves
(updating report page 14) [emphasis added].
21 At [69] her Honour noted that:
Ms Johnstone was extensively cross-examined by both parties.
22 At [72] her Honour said:
As I will more fully discuss later in these reasons, I found the opinions
expressed by Ms Johnstone generally accorded with my assessment
of the parties,
albeit I had some reservations about her conclusions about the father displaying
passive personality traits. I also
had some difficulty with her apparently
conflicting evidence about the father’s ability to meet the
children’s emotional
needs. Otherwise, I accept the general thrust of her
recommendations as soundly based.
23 At [89] a social worker, Ms Thorpe:
opined that constant denigration of the mother by the father had caused the
children to form an alliance with the father. I accept
that opinion. It is
well supported on the evidence before me which I will later discuss.
24 At [94]:
[Child C’s] views are, in some ways, less complex than those of his
brothers. He was much younger when the parties separated,
then being only 7
years old, and in the views he expressed to Ms Thorpe not long after the
parties’ separation he was noted
as really missing aspects of the
mother’s care, including reading stories at night. I find that [Child C]
has been significantly
influenced by his older brothers, and the wishes
expressed by him reflect their views.
25 At [96]:
Having regard to [Child C’s] age at the date of the parties’
separation, the interaction between his parents since that
date, together with
the influence of his older brothers, means I can place little weight on [Child
C’s] expressed views.
26 At [104], her Honour noted that:
It is the mother’s case that the father and his parents have, both
consciously and unconsciously, alienated the children from
27 At [112]:
I was left in no doubt that [Mr Nowell] has no respect for the mother, that
he holds her in contempt, and he would not take any steps
to facilitate the
restoration of the children’s relationship with her.
28 At [114]:
Although the mother’s application is for a final order for equal shared
parental responsibility, and ultimately a shared care
arrangement, at the
conclusion of the hearing she [the mother] acknowledged the difficulties with
such a proposal. She realistically
acknowledged that, without therapy, it is
highly unlikely that her relationship with the children can be reestablished.
however, most appropriately acknowledge that she wanted to apologise to
the children for her actions at the time of the parties’
separation. I
find that it is a commendable concession on her behalf.
29 At [118]:
I am conscious that many of the children’s perceptions about the mother
relate to the unfortunate and badly handled separation
of the parties, and the
children’s perception that they were abandoned by their mother. I find
the mother’s actions
at separation were not child focused but
self-centred. I accept she now acknowledges and regrets the manner in which she
matrimonial home.
30 At [119]:
I am satisfied there is much common sense in Ms Johnstone’s view that
the children should have the benefit of some counselling,
and at least one
supervised visit with the mother after such counselling so that the mother may
apologise to the children.
31 At [120]:
I am satisfied if, after such counselling as may be arranged through
Relationships Australia and one supervised visit, [Child A] and
[Child B] resist
further seeing their mother at this time, then they should not be compelled to
do so but should have the opportunity
at any time to contact the mother and
spend time with her should they desire to do so.
32 At [121]:
[Child C’s] position is a difficult one. On the one hand to make
different arrangements for him may be traumatic for the child,
particularly as
he is so closely aligned with his older brothers. However, on balance, given
his age, I am satisfied that he should
have the opportunity of extended
supervised visits with the mother, which should progress to unsupervised visits
after a period of
twelve months.
33 At [122]:
... I am satisfied given [Child C’s] age and his state of development,
although a change to seeing his mother after a significant period of
time will be a substantial change for him, it is one which is
in his best
[emphasis added].
34 At [129]:
... I am satisfied the father has either, consciously or unconsciously,
influenced the children to speak about their mother in a negative
way, and has
led them to believe the mother has behaved in a dishonest manner, for example,
when they believed she was going to Margaret
River but instead went to Bali as a
result of a surprise trip organised for her. This type of behaviour, which has
led to the alienation
of the children from their mother, is not in their best
35 At [135] when speaking about the paternal grandmother, her Honour said:
I accept that she finds the mother’s tone of voice and some of her
outbursts in the home, caused no doubt largely by the mother’s
frustration
satisfied that she [the grandmother] has conveyed
to the children a view that
they were abandoned by the mother at separation.
36 At [137]:
[Mr Nowell’s] evidence demonstrated little to suggest that he has the
capacity to recognise the children’s need to have
a balanced emotional
development by maintaining a relationship with their mother. He clearly views
the mother as having abandoned
the children and lacking in sensitivity or love
for them. He answered the mother’s questions, which were put politely to
in cross-examination by the mother, in an aggressive and vitriolic manner.
I have a significant concern that he has the capacity
to recognise and provide
for the children’s emotional needs. His view is that he has a duty of
care for the children, and
that the mother left him with
“a tremendous responsibility” rather than recognising the
primary responsibility for the
children lies with their parents.
37 At [140]:
The mother’s actions on a number of occasions disclose that she has
acted in an impulsive, and at times, aggressive manner.
... On a number of
occasions the mother has put her own needs before those of the children. She
has, to her credit, acknowledged
her inappropriate behaviour in leaving the
matrimonial home, initially telling the father and the children she was going
and not then returning for about eight days, or properly speaking
to the children about the breakdown in the parties’ marriage
collected some personal items from the matrimonial home.
38 At [141]:
... She conceded readily in cross-examination that she was from time to time
unreliable in arriving at a prearranged time to see the
children, and her action
in climbing the fence of the matrimonial home in order to gain entry to the
house, while not illegal, did
not demonstrate a capacity to recognise the
detrimental effect of her actions on the children.
39 At [192]:
By reason of [Child A] and [Child B’s] age and the strength of the
views expressed by them, I am satisfied it would be counter-productive
that these adolescents spend time with their mother. [Child C], who was less
affected by the parties’ separation,
has been heavily influenced by his
older brothers
[emphasis added]. It is likely with the benefit of family
therapy that [Child C] will re-establish a meaningful relationship with
mother while continuing to have the security of full-time care by his father.
40 In relation to the purported changes in circumstances, the mother
provides very little information in her case information affidavit
breaches of the orders have allegedly been made. She makes bold statements such
as “every Court order that has
been made giving me access to
the children has been breached”. She does not say whether the supervised
visits or any of them
have occurred with [Child C]. I note that the father in
his case information affidavit says that:
Since the last supervised contact visit none of the [Nowell] siblings have
spent significant time with [Ms Nowell] at their own request.
They have seen
[Ms Nowell] at school and public events. On each occasion [Ms Nowel] has
exhibited the same challenging, confrontational,
bullying and aggressive
behaviours as recorded in numerous previous submissions to the Court, and as
reported by the independent
expert witness in both her reports delivered during
41 I do note it interesting and in accordance with her Honour’s
findings that the father describes the mother as “[Ms
That infers that he considers she has no role to play in the
children’s lives as their mother and is unable
to refer to her as such.
The abovementioned quote however at least infers that there has been more than
one supervised contact visits,
given the reference to the “last”
one. Further in the affidavit the father says:
[Child C] attended several supervised visits with [Ms Nowell]. These did not
flow well, and introduced significant stress into [Child
Conclusion in relation to
Rice & Asplund
42 Firstly, in my view, this is a clear case in which the Court should
exercise its discretion in determining the
Rice & Asplund
on a preliminary basis.
43 On balance, the state of the evidence before me is such that, whilst I am
satisfied there is sufficient material for me to determine
this matter on a
preliminary basis, I am not satisfied that the evidence is such that I should
allow this application to proceed.
In my view, the presiding Judge dealt with a
number of issues that are still being raised in the current set of proceedings.
seems that there was a significant degree of doubt attached to her
Honour’s views about whether the supervision and therapy
would work. In
the circumstances that appear to have existed since those orders were made, it
is clear that the supervision and/or
the therapy have not worked in terms of
rebuilding any of the children’s relationship with the mother. In my
view, there is
very little else the Court could reasonably do in the
circumstances other than what was done at trial and pursuant to the reasons
her Honour. Given the extremely traumatic circumstances of the history of these
proceedings, in particular of the effect of the
proceedings and the
parties’ actions on the children, it would be wholly against their best
interests, and in this particular
application against Child C’s best
interests, to relitigate in relation to Child C’s relationship with
the mother.
44 Whilst I accept that the mother may view these conclusions as
disheartening and perhaps unfair, I must do what I consider to be
children’s best interests. Given the entire history of this matter I am
not satisfied that there has been a change
in circumstances sufficient to
warrant re-litigating the issues in relation to Child C. I therefore
propose to order that the proceedings
currently before the Court be dismissed.
Form 1 application filed on 20 January 2015 and the Form 1A response filed
4 March 2015 are dismissed.
I certify that the preceding [44] paragraphs are a true copy
