Di Carlo v Bar Association of Queensland [2025] HCADisp 267 (6 November 2025)
BAR ASSOCIATION OF
[2025] HCADisp 267
applicant seeks special leave to appeal from the whole of the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland
(Boddice JA, Freeburn
and Sullivan JJ) which granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal
from a decision of the Queensland Civil
and Administrative Tribunal
(Bradley J) confirming the respondent's decision to refuse to renew the
applicant's practising certificate.
proposed appeal has insufficient prospects of success to justify a grant of
special leave and otherwise raises no issue of legal
principle or of public
importance.
leave to appeal is refused.
