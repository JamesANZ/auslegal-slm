Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody—Implementation of
Recommendations—Evaluation of Implementation
The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody established 339
recommendations in response to the significant amount of Indigenous
custody. The recommendations were an attempt to reduce the occurrence of such
deaths through amending the role of the Coroner
and the Coroner’s
investigative powers into these matters within the Coroner’s Act 1996
(WA). However, this article’s
analysis of the coronial inquests of Mr
Ward, Ms Dhu and Ms Mandijarra identifies that the Western Australian government
to implement the majority of the Royal Commission’s
recommendations. The few that have been incorporated in relation to police
custody have been inadequately implemented. In particular, the failure to
implement certain legislative changes, such as arresting
an individual being a
principle of last resort and the decriminalisation of public intoxication, has
resulted in breaches of the

analysis of three coronial inquests, those of Mr
Mandijarra,
will identify that in
Western Australia the majority of the Royal Commission’s recommendations
have not been implemented or
have been unsatisfactorily partially adopted. Due
to the State government’s inadequate partial fulfilment of the
recommendations
of the Royal Commission, the amount of Indigenous deaths in
custody has increased.
II THE ROLE OF THE CORONER
The role of the State Coroner in Western Australia, governed by the
Coroner’s Act 1996
(WA) (‘the Act’), was significantly
amended based on the recommendations made by the Royal
Commission.
The primary function
of a Coroner is investigative in nature; that is, to determine the identity of
the deceased and the cause and
Recommendation 6 of the
Royal Commission was implemented by amending s 3 of the Act so that the term
‘reportable deaths’
encompasses a death of an Indigenous person that
occurred whilst in custody.
Royal Commission also made Recommendations 7 to 18 in respect of the role of
Coroners that generally involved broadening the
powers of a Coroner conducting
an inquiry.
recommendations sought to enable a Coroner to look beyond the cause and manner
of death to include an investigation into underlying
factors that may have
contributed to an Aboriginal custodial
These recommendations reflect the Royal Commission’s identification of
the underlying factors that have contributed to the over-representation
Aboriginal people in custody.
Coroner, under s 25(2) of the Act, is empowered to make findings on anything
that is connected with the death, such as any matters
of ‘public health,
safety or the administration of
implemented as a result of Recommendation
This power was further
expanded under s 25(3), although Recommendation 12 was only partially
implemented,
to examine the
‘quality of the care, treatment and supervision’ of the deceased
prior to death.
This examination
is required if the deceased individual was determined to be held in custody
under s 22(1)(a), the section also establishes
that an inquest must be held if
the deceased was held in custody before the death
Therefore, the
expansion of the Coroner’s ability to comment on surrounding circumstances
of the death is intended to lead
to the identification of underlying factors
that contribute to the over-representation of Aboriginal people in
However, as a result of the Royal Commission’s recommendations, the
Coroner’s powers under s 25(2) and (3) are restricted
by s 25(5), which
prohibits the Coroner from making comments that determine questions of liability
However, the courts in
Perre v Chivell
Keown v Khan
identified that even though making findings of criminal guilt and civil
liability is not a part of the Coroner’s role,
the Coroner is able to make
findings that an individual or an organisation had contributed to the occurrence
of the death. If the
Coroner is going to make adverse findings in relation to an
individual, s 44(2) ensures that the individual is provided with a chance
make contrary submissions.
Coroner determining that an individual had contributed to the death, for
example, is an essential part of the process of identifying
how the death
occurred in order to prevent avoidable deaths in the
III IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS
Although Western Australia has made significant legislative amendments to
implement the recommendations of the Royal
Commission,
the failure to
implement the majority of the recommendations has resulted in the further
increase in Aboriginal custodial
Nationally, from 1991 to
2008, the number of Aboriginal deaths in custody was 279 and 109 of those deaths
occurred within police
This is a significant increase from the 99 Aboriginal deaths, 63 within police
custody, that occurred between the years of 1980 and
In this section, three of
the Aboriginal deaths in police custody, those of Mr
Mandijarra,
will be analysed to
illustrate the failure of Western Australia to implement the Royal
Commission’s recommendations. Furthermore,
the analysis will identify any
progress in this area that has since been instigated whilst the coronial
inquests took place as a
result of the Indigenous deaths in custody.
A The Ward Inquest
The State Coroner determined that Mr Ward’s death was avoidable as it
was caused by heatstroke as a result of being held in
custody in the pod of a
police vehicle that was transported in an unreasonably hot temperature for a
significant period of time.
making this determination, the Coroner, by reason of the implemented Royal
Commission recommendations,
able to make investigations regarding the ‘supervision, treatment and
care’ of Mr Ward.
so, the Coroner determined that the Department of Corrective Services and the
employees of GSL Custodial Services Pty Ltd,
particularly those of Mr Powell and
Ms Stokoe, the drivers of the police vehicle, all contributed to the death based
on the inadequate
quality of supervision, treatment and care whilst in the care
of those parties.
Western Australia has implemented Recommendation 333 of the Royal
Commission,
which recommended
that Australia become a signatory party to the Optional Protocol to the
International Covenant on Civil and Political
However, the Coroner
identified that due to the nature of Mr Ward’s death the supervising
individuals had breached both arts
7 and 10(1) of the
International Covenant
on Civil and Political
Article 7 prohibits
the inhumane, degrading treatment or punishment of individuals, whilst art 10(1)
creates a positive obligation
where an individual is deprived of liberty,
requiring that the individual to be treated
Therefore, on the
basis of the analysis of Mr Ward’s death, the adopted recommendations of
the Royal Commission enabled the
Coroner to utilise broad powers in determining
contributions to the death to prevent further deaths occurring. However, the
implementation
of Recommendation 333 in respect of international obligations did
not prevent the death from
As a result, the Coroner made a further 14
recommendations,
particularly
Recommendations 2 and 11,
relation to providing additional powers of review and to the duty of care owed
to detained Indigenous people. The Coroner’s
Recommendation 2 suggested a
broadening of the powers of the Office of Inspector of Custodial Services by
modelling new provisions
on the terms of
Terrorism (Preventative
Detention) Act 2006
This recommendation has since been implemented by the Western Australian
government through the introduction of the
Inspector of Custodial Services
Amendment Act 2011
Coroner further made Recommendation 11 that the policies and procedures of the
GSL Custodial Services Pty Ltd be regularly reviewed
by the Department of
Corrective Services with respect to ensuring that the duty of care owed to
Indigenous detainees is complied
Therefore, due to the
failure to comply with international treaty obligations, the Coroner established
various recommendations in
order to prevent the occurrence of similar deaths to
that of Mr Ward’s.
B The Dhu Inquest
Unlike the case of Mr Ward, Ms Dhu’s being taken into police custody
prior to her death was a result of an offence, being the
failure to pay certain

Commission identified such offences as being one where Indigenous people are
over-represented among

as identified by the Royal
Commission.
Furthermore, the
Coroner highlighted the necessity of legislative amendment by referring to a
2016 report that identified that 73
per cent of the female fine defaulters
within police custody are
unemployed,
with Aboriginal
women encompassing 64 per cent of the total female fine
defaulters.
While the Western
Australian government adopted Recommendation 87 as a principle to be used by
police officers, there is not a definite
legislative provision enforcing the

recommendations were based on findings that 35 individuals of the 99 cases that
the Royal Commission investigated were in custody
due to public
drunkenness.
Through the Royal
Commission’s investigations the over-representation of Aboriginal people
arrested for public intoxication
was identified to amount to 46 per cent of the
individuals detained.
Furthermore, the Royal Commission ascertained that Indigenous women arrested for
public intoxication represented 78 per cent of the
females taken into custody
for the offence.
However, even

The Coroner further
identified that police officers had considered utilising the facility for Ms
Mandijarra, however, due to her
banned status from the facility it was not an
option that could be applied.
Therefore, unlike Mr Ward’s and Ms Dhu’s inquests, there was no
additional action taken by governmental authorities to
improve the treatment of
Aboriginal people since the death of Ms Mandijarra due to the already
implemented alternatives to detention
IV CONCLUSION
Due to the over-representation of Aboriginal people being incarcerated and
the significant amount of Indigenous deaths in custody,
the Royal Commission
established recommendations in an attempt to reduce the occurrences of these
The recommendations made
with respect to the change in the role of a Coroner and the Coroner’s
investigative powers have largely
been implemented within Western Australia
through amendments made to the
Coroner’s Act 1996
However, the same
diligence has not been applied with regard to implementing the majority of the
recommendations, particularly in
relation to the prevention of Aboriginal
custodial deaths.
Consequently,
a further 279 Aboriginal deaths have taken place.
This article considered the deaths of Mr Ward, Ms Dhu and Ms Mandijarra, and
in doing so argued that the Western Australian government
has not adequately
implemented the Royal Commission’s
recommendations.
Specifically,
the government has failed to implement legislative amendments in relation to the
recommendations concerning the enforcement
of breaches of the
International
Covenant on Civil and Political
to legislate the
principle of arresting an individual the last option
considered,
decriminalisation of public
intoxication.
This is further
reflected in the unsatisfactory attempt of the State government in establishing
the Justice Ministers’ Working
Group, which has failed to apply the Royal
Commission’s recommendations by not implementing the policies
considered.
While Western
Australia has partially implemented the Royal Commission recommendations through
the establishment of the sobering-up
facilities,
government’s efforts have so far proved inadequate to reduce the
significant amount of Aboriginal custodial deaths.
