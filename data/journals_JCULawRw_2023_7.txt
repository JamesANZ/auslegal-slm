The Stage of Law: Examining Performers’ Rights in
India and Australia’s Entertainment Industries
Karnika Bansal
Performers play a crucial role in the creative process by bringing various
performances, and
films (cinematographic works), to life. However, unlike other stakeholders,
including lyricists, music composers,
and production companies, performers often
do not receive equivalent property rights. This paper contends that despite
certain protections
granted to performers under copyright laws in many
countries, including India and Australia, there remain gaps and limitations that
hinder the full recognition and protection of performers’ rights. This
situation leads to questions regarding the nature of
performers’ rights
and how the law distinguishes neighbouring rights within the copyright law
framework. The primary aim of
this paper is to assess whether the existing
framework of performers’ rights principally benefits the performers
or leans more towards a market-centred approach favouring producers.
This analysis, particularly focused on the contexts of India
and Australia,
builds a case for the recognition of co-authorship rights for performers.
I Introduction
Performers’ rights, also known as neighbouring rights, are a distinct
set of legal protections related to, but separate from,
traditional copyright.
These rights are granted to individuals or entities that contribute to the
performance of copyrightable subject
matter but are not the original
creators/authors of the underlying works incorporated therein. In this context,
neighbouring rights
are defined as follows:
In the traditional narrower sense, the term “related rights” (or
its synonym “neighboring rights”) means the
rights of performers in
respect of their performances, the rights of producers of phonograms in respect
of their phonograms, and
the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of
their broadcasts.
The purpose of neighbouring or related rights is to recognise and safeguard
the contributions of certain individuals and organisations
that play a crucial
role in making creative works available to the
These rights, closely
linked to authored works, provide legal protection for the efforts of these
contributors. Typically, these
rights are assigned to three groups: performers,
producers of phonograms (sound recordings), and broadcasting
organisations.
However, some laws
specify that the exercise of neighbouring rights should not interfere with or
diminish the protection of

their rights.

Rome Convention
. However, the 2012 amendments led to the removal of
these provisions, which were replaced by two key sections, ss 38A and
to establish positive
rights for performers.
Section 38A(1) outlines the exclusive rights granted to performers. These
rights are separate from the rights of the original authors
and include the
authority to authorise various acts related to their performance or any
substantial part thereof. These acts include:
(i) making a sound or visual
recording of the performance, its reproduction in any material form, and storage
in any medium; (ii)
issuing copies to the public; (iii) communicating the
performance to the public; (iv) selling or renting it commercially; and (v)
broadcasting or communicating the performance to the public, except when the
performance is already broadcast.
Section 38 B of the Indian
, on the other
hand, outlines the moral rights of performers, akin to those granted to authors
under s 57. These moral rights, inherent
to the performer, remain unaffected by
the assignment of other rights. They include the right to be recognised as the
performer of
the work and the right to object to any modification or distortion
of the performance that could harm their
reputation.
So far, the changes introduced in 2012, do not raise any critical concerns.
However, the next set of changes made to the Act, specifically
the addition of

regarding their interpretation and application

If interpreted strictly, this amendment implies that performers also have the
right to share royalties with copyright owners. No Indian

applied the interpretation discussed with certainty, despite multiple attempts

internationally, as will be detailed in the
forthcoming sections. Thus, the concept of ‘royalty’ has emerged as

Meanwhile, several
cases filed by the Indian Singers' and Musicians' Rights Association
(‘ISAMRA’), formerly known as
Indian Singers’ Rights
Association (‘ISRA’), in Indian courts, highlight a new judicial
perspective on paying royalties
to singers for their contributions to sound
recordings.
One of the seminal cases in Indian copyright law regarding performers’
rights took place in 1978. Although it predates the 1994
amendments and occurred
before the term ‘performer’ was defined in the

Films International v Dev
involved the
renowned film actor Dev Anand. The Bombay High Court heard this as an appeal
from the original lawsuit related to the
Hindi motion picture, ‘Darling

in an audiovisual
work, such as a cinematographic film, could hold copyright
over their performance.
The brief facts of the case are that in December 1972, Fortune Films

The court’s deliberations were guided by the
existing statutory framework and the contractual agreement between the parties.
During the appeal, Dev Anand based his copyright claim on the assertion that an
actor’s performance qualifies as ‘artistic

agreement between the parties, Desai J. made several observations that remain
pivotal in understanding the position
of performers in both copyright law and
contract operations. He noted as follows:

there is and it is covered by the definition of 'work' to
be found in

that the Copyright Act, 1957. does not

In relation to the agreement between the two parties, the Court opined that
even if the performer had a copyright specific to his

sought. The performer’s rights

decision illustrates a scenario where, despite an agreed
clause for the transfer of intellectual property rights, specifically copyright,
from the performer to the producers, the Court questioned the legal recognition
of such a right. It could not categorise an actor’s
performance as a
‘work’ eligible for copyright within the existing statutory
framework, thereby avoiding the issue of
its creative value as a separate
property right.
One could argue that performers now have ‘neighbouring rights’
that did not exist at the time. However, these neighbouring
rights, being
distinct from copyright, do not offer the same value and protection. In fact, it
is argued here that the legal status
of audiovisual performers has not seen
substantial change since the
case. For example, under the
current performers’ rights laws in the Indian
an audiovisual performer consents in writing to the recording and incorporation
of their performance in a cinematographic film,
they relinquish any further
rights to that performance.
Thus, the intertwined nature of contract law with performers’ rights, as
seen in the past, continues to dominate and shape
industry practices in favour
of production companies.
Performers’
Right to Royalties
The economic rights of performers in India have been a matter of dispute,
especially with regard to royalties, since the amendments
made in 2012. This
issue gained attention in 2016 with the Indian Singers' Rights Association (now
known as the Indian Singers' and
Musicians' Rights Association), a copyright
collecting organisation. They began legal proceedings against restaurants and
used sound recordings without paying the corresponding

ISRA’s argument was based on the 2012 amendments to the

They argued that the proviso to s 38A states that a ‘performer shall be

use’. This, when interpreted alongside the definition of ‘for

heirs or to a collecting society, with any
other form of assignment being

similar right to copyright.
In response to ISRA’s argument, the Delhi High Court, in the 2016 suits
filed against a restaurant and a lounge, delivered
noting the following:
The Court is satisfied that the Plaintiff has been able to prove the
infringement by the Defendant of the R3 of the members of the

members of the Plaintiff by the Defendant by playing the said
performances in
its bar and restaurant without obtaining the Performer’s Rights Clearance
Certificate thus constitutes an infringement
of the R3 of the members of the

Immediately, after the
injunctions were granted, music
labels, which were not named as defendants in the original lawsuits, filed an
appeal. They argued
that they were affected parties, as ISRA was essentially
seeking to enforce rights that they believed belonged to
The music labels
approached the Court, asserting that they retained full rights to the songs in
their collection, including all elements
of a song, such as the
performance.
Subsequently in
2016, the court allowed the music labels to intervene and instructed them to
produce their agreements with the singers
to help clarify the legal issues
involved. Since then, the issue of a performer’s right to royalties for

of recorded songs has remained mired in ambiguity in Indian
A key point of contention that emerged is the nature of these performances,
specifically whether the rights apply only to ‘live
performances’ or
also extend to ‘non-live’ studio recordings. ISRA has consistently
argued that any performance,
as long as it originates from a ‘flesh and
blood’ effort rather than a mechanical or fixed rendition, deserves
protection.
They draw support
from the 2006 Delhi High Court decision in
Neha Bhasin v Anand Raj Anand
which stated that ‘every performance has to be live in the first instance
whether it is before an audience or in a
Conversely, music labels have opposed this interpretation, contending that it
contradicts the definition of ‘performance’
under s 2(q) of the Act,
which they argue is limited to live performances
They assert that in 1994,
the legislature deliberately amended the definition of ‘performance’
to encapsulate the concept
of a ‘live’
performance.
This amendment,
along with the introduction of the term ‘sound recording,’ was
intended to clearly distinguish rights
between live performances and sound
recordings, the latter inherently being non-live activities.
The ambiguity in the law led to further litigation, exemplified by the 2020
lawsuit against Dharma
Productions.
Here, the Delhi
High Court’s decision to admit yet another suit to the list of pending
cases on the issue, suggested a possible
re-evaluation of performers’
However, a definitive
judicial clarification remains elusive in light of a recent industry agreement
negotiated between ISRA and
the Indian Music
Formally announced in
April 2023, this currently confidential settlement aims to ensure that all
singers affiliated with ISRA receive
appropriate royalties from music labels
across India.
As such, even
though the industry-wide consensus has led to the withdrawal of the pending
cases, the issues previously brought before
the Indian courts remain unresolved.
This situation reflects a complex interplay between statutory law, judicial
interpretation,
and industry practices, all of which continue to affect
performers’ rights in India.

In Australia, the issue of

some domestic copyright
cases shed light on aspects such as the right to
reproduction, broader insights are often drawn from cases in the UK and the US.

This decision indicates
that while performers in Australia have a reproduction right, the scope of this
right is often delineated
by the ‘substantial part’ test.
The distinction between authorship and performance in collaborative musical
creation was further tackled in the
case by the UK courts.
This case arose when members of the band Spandau Ballet took legal action
against Gary Kemp, another member,
seeking a share in the copyright of some
songs. A core dispute was over the song ‘True’, in which Gary Kemp,
songwriter, wrote its lyrics, chords, and basic melody. The song
contained a notable 16-bar saxophone solo, which accounted for about
song, by band member Steven Norman. While Norman crafted this solo based on the
chords provided by Kemp, the main question
was whether this contribution
qualified him as a joint or co-author of the song. The court concluded that
Norman’s saxophone
solo did not make a ‘significant and original
contribution’ to the overall composition. They decided that while the
musicians’ inputs shaped the song’s performance and
interpretation, it didn’t contribute to its foundational creation
composition. Park J established that the primary elements of the song, including
its melody, chords, rhythm, and structure, were
already conceived in
Kemp’s mind before he introduced it to the band. As a result, the court
ruled that such a performance
could not be copyrighted.
Much like Australia and the UK, the US Courts have adopted a similar
position. In the case of
Aalmuhammed v
the US Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit examined the definition of ‘work’ for
the purposes of joint authorship in
. In this case,
the court revisited the problem of defining ‘a copyrightable work’.
While doing so, the court referred
to the Supreme Court’s decision in
Feist Publications, Inc., v Rural Telephone Service
which stated that, for a
work to be copyrightable, ‘some minimal level of creativity’ or
‘originality’ is
required. However, the US Court of Appeals in the
Aalmuhammed Case
went on to interrogate this decision. The court held
that, if this is to be accepted as the test for what amounts to a
‘copyrightable
work’, the meaning of the term ‘work’
would be ‘too broad’, as ‘everyone from the producer and
director to casting director, costumer, hairstylist, and “best boy”
gets listed in the movie credits because all of their
creative contributions
really do matter’.
This position was reiterated in the
, in which the US court
re-emphasised the fact that granting Garcia copyright of her performance would
result in breaking the definition
of ‘work’ into too many pieces,
therefore making the exploitation of the film
impossible.
In said case, an
actress called Cindy Lee Garcia recorded her performance for a film entitled
‘Desert Warrior’. The movie
was put on hold and the director used
the recorded performance to produce an anti-Islamic film. The actress had no
knowledge of this

it. Garcia’s dialogue was dubbed to fit the film’s context.
shortly after the trailer of the movie was uploaded onto YouTube, it led to
religious outrage across the Middle East. Following
the outrage, an Egyptian
cleric issued a fatwa calling upon Muslims in America to kill anyone associated
with the making of the film.
Upon receiving death threats Garcia sent Google
several takedown notices asserting, among other things, that she had the right
control her likeness and that the broadcasting of the film infringed her
Google refused
to remove the film and Garcia sued Google in 2012.
Garcia’s copyright entitlements to her performance and right to
publicity, among other things, were rejected by the Los Angeles
Superior Court,
the US Federal Court, and a US District Court. A divided panel in the US Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit finally
partially reversed the decision in
McKeown J. remarked that this case is a plea for personal protection
‘juxtaposed with the limits of copyright law and fundamental
principles of
free speech’.
With regard
to Garcia’s copyright claim for her five-second performance, the appellate
court analysed whether or not the facts
and law favoured her position. The Court
discussed, at length, who constitutes an ‘author’ under copyright
law. It distinguished
that, under the current statutory scheme, performances are
not defined as a ‘work of authorship’; instead, it’s
audiovisual work, such as the motion film or a script, that falls within the
definition of ‘works of authorship’.

particularly significant
when considering performer’s rights. For instance, a singer’s
performance, regardless of its

lyrics or the
composer of the music. This distinction is vital in understanding
the scope and limitations of performers’ rights in relation
to the broader
framework of copyright law. This underscores the legal perspective that a
performer’s effort and the impact
of their performance are not necessarily
viewed as original or creatively distinct in relation to pre-existing
IV Conclusion
The journey of performers’ rights in copyright law, particularly in
India and Australia along with other common law countries,
show a complex
tapestry of legislative intent, judicial interpretations, and practical
challenges. Drawing from the intricate landscape
of cases like
Hadley v Kemp
CBS Records Australia v Gross
is evident that judges handling matters of authorship, tend to adopt a
traditional perspective when interpreting the notions
of ‘author’,
‘works’, and the level of originality and creativity needed for
complexity becomes even more pronounced when viewed
through the lens of Indian and Australian copyright laws. Despite international
recognition and provisions within both the Indian and Australian
aiming to protect
performers’ rights, an evident gap remains between the rights of authors
and performers.
In India, the lack of clarity on the distribution of royalties under the
and a gamut of interpretational errors in defining and
applying the scope of a performance has left the performers at the whims of
industry practices. The responsibility of providing clarity seems to oscillate
between the judiciary and the legislature. For instance,
when the Parliamentary
Committee Report on the Copyright Amendment Bill in 2010 examined the addition
of ss 38A and 38B to the Act,
it noted concerns by the Association of Radio

are not in the best interests of the performers. These
contracts might exploit
legislative ambiguities, binding performers to unfavourable terms. The lack of
clear legal guidelines also
hampers performers’ ability to assert rightful
claims or challenge exploitative practices in court, as the legal outcomes of
such actions are uncertain because of the ambiguous state of law. This is
particularly problematic in countries like India, with
its massive entertainment
sector, where such ambiguities perpetuate a status quo that is often
disadvantageous to performers.
The article thus, suggests that the amendments intended to clarify the law
have not achieved their expected outcomes. Instead, they
have shaped a legal
landscape where performers’ rights can be, and often are, exploited by
more powerful industry players who
can navigate or manipulate these legal
ambiguities. Given that the entertainment industry relies heavily on the talents
of its performers,
recognising and protecting their contributions, especially
against unwarranted exploitation, is an ongoing global challenge. WIPO’s
statement highlights this issue, illustrating the disparity in rights across
various mediums and the vulnerabilities performers often
From the lack of
entitlement to payments for performances on certain mediums, the inability to
assert moral rights, to the potential
harm digital technologies can inflict on
an actor’s reputation, the multifaceted challenges faced by performers are
vast. Consequently,

‘A musician who
records a sound-only CD may be paid whenever that CD is sold or broadcast in a
country that is party to the
WIPO phonograms treaty, but the same performance on
a music video does not carry the same entitlement to payment. An actor in a film
or TV series sold abroad has no legal right to payment for foreign broadcasts or
DVD sales. Any payment for use of the film or TV
series that may be made under
national laws often goes in its entirety to the producer. Once authorization has
been given for filming
a performance, actors in most countries have no control
over how that performance is used. In particular, they may not be able to
“moral rights” that ensure attribution and respect for the integrity
of their performance. Digital technologies
make it easy to manipulate video
images and may do so in ways that can harm an actor’s reputation. Actors
who provide “movements”
for computer-generated characters using
motion-capture technology (as used, for example, in The Adventures of Tintin
movie [2011]
directed by Stephen Spielberg) also often have no legal say in use
of their work.’ ‘Performers’ Rights –
