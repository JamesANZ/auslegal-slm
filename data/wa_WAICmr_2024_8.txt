individuals in this matter, the Information Commissioner (

The complainant applied to the agency
for internal review of its decision. By internal review decision dated 18
September 2023, the
agency varied its initial decision claiming that the
disputed information was exempt under clause 3(1) and clause 8(2) of Schedule
to the FOI Act (
clause 8(2)
On 21 October 2023, the
complainant applied to the Commissioner for external review of the
agency’s decision. During the course
of the external review, the
complainant provided the Commissioner with evidence that a number of third
parties consented to the disclosure
of their personal information in the Report
to the complainant and claimed that the limit on the exemption in clause 3(5)
to that information.
On 21 March 2024, one of the
Commissioner’s officers provided the parties with their assessment. It
was the officer’s
assessment that the Commissioner was likely to be of the
view, based on the information then before this office, that the disputed
information was exempt under clause 3(1). The complainant did not accept the
officer’s assessment and made further submissions.
complainant claimed that they had been able to ascertain, from the electronic
version of the edited copy of the Report given to
them by the agency, that the
agency initially proposed to delete far less information than was ultimately
deleted. The complainant
alleged that this suggested that the agency had
attempted to ‘maliciously hinder’ their access application.
The Commissioner observed that, in this matter, the complainant had
applied to access a document that, by its nature, contains a substantial
of personal information, including personal information about individuals that
is, in many instances, intertwined with personal
information about other
individuals. Having regard to the issues that decision-makers are required to
carefully consider when assessing
documents of this kind – including to
what extent is information in the document ‘personal information’ as
in the FOI Act, and to what extent is personal information about the
applicant (if any) intertwined with personal information about
other individuals
such that one cannot be disclosed without the other – the Commissioner
considered that it is not surprising
that minds differ, or that an officer may
change their mind, as to what extent information in a document of the disputed
exempt. Accordingly, the Commissioner did not accept the
complainant’s allegation.
Clause 3(1) provides that matter is
exempt matter if its disclosure would reveal ‘personal information’
(whether living or dead). Personal information is exempt
under clause 3(1) subject to the application of the limits on the exemption
out in clauses 3(2)-3(6).
Based on her examination of the disputed
information, the Commissioner was satisfied that the disputed information
contains personal
information about individuals which is, on its face, exempt
under clause 3(1).
Clause 3(5) provides that matter is not exempt under
clause 3(1) if the applicant provides evidence establishing that the individual
concerned consents to the disclosure of the matter to the applicant. The
Commissioner observed that, although certain individuals
consented to the
disclosure of their personal information to the complainant, that personal
information was inextricably intertwined
with personal information about other
individuals who had not provided consent. As such, the Commissioner considered
that the limit
on the exemption in clause 3(5) did not apply.
Clause 3(6)
provides that matter is not exempt under clause 3(1) if its disclosure would, on
balance, be in the public interest.
Under section 102(3), the onus is on the
complainant, as the access applicant, to establish that disclosure would, on
balance, be
in the public interest.
Determining whether or not
disclosure would, on balance, be in the public interest involves identifying the
public interests for and
against disclosure, weighing them against each other
and deciding where the balance lies.
The Commissioner considered
that the complainant’s interest in the disclosure of the disputed
information is a personal or private
interest. The Commissioner observed that
the public interest is not primarily concerned with the personal interests of
the particular
access applicant. Rather, the question is whether disclosure of
the disputed information would be of some benefit to the public
generally, and
whether that public benefit is sufficient to outweigh any public interest in the
maintenance of the privacy of other
individuals.
It is well established
that disclosure of information under the FOI Act is disclosure to the world at
large as no restrictions or
conditions can be placed upon the release of
documents under the FOI Act: see

[2018] WASC
. Accordingly, when considering whether or not to disclose documents
under the FOI Act, the effects of disclosure are generally considered
disclosure were to the world at large, rather than only to the particular access
In favour of disclosure, the Commissioner recognised that
there is a public interest in people being able to access personal information
the FOI Act. The Commissioner also recognised a public
interest in the
accountability of agencies for the manner in which they deal with workplace
complaints. The Commissioner considered
that this public interest was satisfied
by the information the agency had given to the complainant, including the edited
the Report provided, and that disclosure of the disputed information
would not assist in making the agency more accountable in this
Weighing against disclosure, the Commissioner recognised that the
public interest in maintaining personal privacy is a strong one
and may only be
displaced by some other, strong or compelling public interest or interests that
require the disclosure of personal
information about persons to another
In balancing the competing public interests, the Commissioner was
not persuaded that the public interests favouring disclosure of
the disputed
information were sufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in the
protection of the personal privacy of other
individuals. As a result, the
Commissioner considered that the limit on the exemption in clause 3(6) did not
Accordingly, the Commissioner confirmed the agency’s
decision and found that the disputed information is exempt under clause
Schedule 1 to the FOI Act.
