HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA
IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY
SHANE WILLIAM MCWHINNEY FOR
LEAVE TO ISSUE OR FILE
[2025] HCASJ 24
Date of Judgment: 14 August
M59 of 2025
ex parte application filed on 22 July 2025 for leave to issue or file an
application for a constitutional or other writ is refused.
Representation
The applicant is unrepresented
On 14 July 2025, Steward J, acting under r 6.07.2 of the
High Court Rules 2004
(Cth) directed the Registrar to refuse to
issue or file Mr McWhinney's proposed application for a constitutional or
other writ, without
leave of a Justice of this Court. Mr McWhinney now
seeks that leave.
Mr McWhinney's
application seeks various orders concerning "the Joint Defence Space Research
Facility [Pine Gap]". He seeks orders
that: the Governor-General of the
Commonwealth of Australia direct the Australian Defence Force to seize control
of that facility;
the Minister for Home Affairs manage an investigation into the
activities of the seized facility; upon discovery of any breach of
issues of international law or Australian law, the Minister for Foreign Affairs
terminate an agreement between the Commonwealth
of Australia and the United
States relating to that facility and the "UKUSA agreement"; and upon discovery
of any breach of particular
issues of international law or Australian law, the
Commonwealth Treasurer manage the transfer of various shareholdings on the
"Australian
Stock Exchange" held by various banks with the Attorney-General to
manage the establishment of a perpetual trust of those shareholdings
administered by three to five former judges of this Court with dividends to
be paid to all Australian citizens on an annual
Mr McWhinney's
statement of the factual background to the proposed application for a
constitutional or other writ and his statement
in support of his proposed
application are detailed and he has put much emotional effort and time into the
preparation of his accompanying
affidavit. But there is nothing in any of those
materials that discloses any arguable basis for any of the relief sought. The
application is, on its face, "manifestly untenable" and an abuse of
process within r 6.07.1 of the
High Court Rules
and should be
determined without being listed for hearing and with reasons published in
accordance with r 13.04 of the
Mr McWhinney's
ex parte application for leave to issue or file an application for a
constitutional or other writ, filed on 22 July
