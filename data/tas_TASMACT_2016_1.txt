INTRODUCTION
1. The respondent seeks orders for costs upon two references
determined by the Tribunal in a decision cited as Simmons v Motor Accidents
Insurance Board [2015] TASMACT 3. The factual background to those references is
set out in the introduction to that decision. It’s
convenient for me to
repeat it here and it follows:
“1 On the morning of 21
June 2010 the applicant was driving to work. Her teenage son was with her.
There was an accident involving
another vehicle being driven by Ms Rowan
Morphett. (I will address the circumstances of the accident in more detail later
reasons). The applicant contends that as a consequence of the accident
she has suffered a chronic pain disorder underpinned by a
soft tissue injury to
her neck. The respondent Board agrees that the accident has caused the
applicant to suffer a chronic pain
disorder. However, it says that the accident
occurred in circumstances which were incapable of causing the applicant any
injury and that her pain disorder is solely attributable to psychogenic
factors. This standpoint led the respondent to write to
the applicant on 27
April 2012 advising her that “the Board is unable to attend to the payment
of any form of treatment that
relates to a physical injury from 1 May 2012 (eg
physiotherapy, massage and treatment from Mr Bittar and Dr Evans) and
pharmaceutical
expenses that relate to the treatment of physical injuries (eg
naramig, aspro clear, paracetamol and panamax).”
applicant responded to this stance by making a referral to the Tribunal under
s28(2) of the Motor Accidents (Liabilities &
Compensation) Act 1973
(‘the Act’). It cites the ground for the reference in these
“I dispute that I did not sustain ‘any
physical injury’ as a result of my motor vehicle accident on 21 June 2010
or that by implication I do not continue to suffer from the effects of
‘any physical injury’ and therefore dispute the
determination that it is ‘unable to attend to the payment of any form of
treatment that relates to a physical
injury from 1st May
is accepted by the parties that since the applicant filed her reference she has
made claims upon the respondent for treatment and
pharmaceutical expenses
totalling $3294.51 and that the respondent has formally determined not to pay
these claims. This has led
to a second reference being made to the Tribunal
whereby the applicant seeks a determination that the respondent pay these
the result the Tribunal has two references before it which it is required to
determine “as it considers proper in the circumstances”
2. The first reference, which challenged the respondent’s
refusal to pay for the treatment of any physical injury suffered by
applicant, was determined in the respondent’s favour, the Tribunal holding
that the applicant’s chronic pain condition
was solely attributable to
psychological factors without any physical or organic component. Upon the
second reference each party
was part-successful with the Tribunal determining,
on the one hand, that the applicant should be reimbursed the cost of facet
undertaken on the advice of her pain management consultant but on the
other determining that a range of medication costs were not
payable by the
respondent. These determinations meant that the applicant recovered $1,179.00
of the total disputed amount of $3,294.51.
3. By regulation 14(1) of the
Motor Accident Compensation Tribunal Regulations 2009 (‘the
Regulations’) the Tribunal is
empowered to award costs, it providing that
“On determining a reference, the Tribunal may order a party to the
reference to
pay costs to another party to the reference and may fix the
reasonable amount of those costs.”
4. Although the Tribunal’s
discretion to award costs is unfettered it must be exercised judicially.
Ordinarily the proper exercise
of that discretion requires that costs follow the
event and are thus awarded to the successful party. As explained by McHugh J in
Latoudis v Casey
[1990] HCA 59
[1991] 170 CLR 534
at 567 “The rationale of the order is
that it is just and reasonable for the party who has caused the other party to
the costs of litigation to reimburse that party for the liability
incurred. The order is not made to punish the unsuccessful party.
function is compensatory. Thus, in civil proceedings an order may, and usually
will, be made even though the unsuccessful
party has nearly succeeded or has
acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings.” The ordinary rule that
costs follow the
event may be departed from where the conduct of the successful
party, other than that which gave rise to the claim, was unreasonable
improper or where that party did something connected with the proceedings
calculated to occasion unnecessary litigation or expense.
See Unilever v Gunn
and Anor. 134/1998.
5. In my view there was not any conduct on the part of
either party which warrants a departure from the ordinary rule that costs follow
6. As I have said the respondent was completely successful upon
the first reference. However, it was only part successful upon the
my view the appropriate cost orders should reflect the fact that the respondent
was the substantial victor but at the
same time should recognise the
applicant’s part success upon the second reference. However, I suspect
that if I make separate
but different orders upon each reference then very real
practical difficulties will arise for the parties in separating those costs
attributable to the first reference from those resulting from the second. The
solution is for me to make the same order upon both
references which in my view
is reflective of the outcome of the litigation when considered in its entirety.
On this basis there
will be an order that the applicant pay 85% of the
respondent’s costs upon each reference.
7. The submissions made by
the parties give rise to two issues relevant to Regulation 14(1) and the
“reasonable amount”
of the costs payable. The first concerns an
appropriate scale to be employed by which the costs are set. The second is
the costs to be levied by the respondent should include the costs of two
counsel. I will deal with each in turn.
8. The respondent submits that the
scale that should apply in this instance is that scale currently utilised for
the costs on a civil
action in the Supreme Court. However, for the applicant it
is contended that this Tribunal is akin to the Workers Rehabilitation
Compensation Tribunal and that the cost scale in that jurisdiction should apply
here. Those costs are set at the rate of 85%
of the fees set out in Part 1 of
Schedule 1 to the Supreme Court Rules 2000 “unless the Tribunal otherwise
See Regulation 15(2) of the Workers Rehabilitation and
Compensation Regulations 2011.
9. The case of Trident Seafoods Pty Ltd v
Dransfield A64/1993 involved a successful appeal against a decision of the
Workers Compensation
Commissioner to refuse to make a cost order. It was
submitted to Zeeman J that the cost order to be made by him be on Table A, that
is the highest scale for costs on actions in the Supreme Court. This was
considered inappropriate on the basis that the Tribunal
proceedings “were
proceedings in an inferior court.” His Honour then ordered that the costs
be set at the lower Table
10. In my view I should abide by the
rationale in Trident and set costs for matters in this Tribunal at a lower rate
than would be
payable in a Supreme Court action. I consider the scale of costs
prescribed to apply to matters in the workers compensation jurisdiction
suitable scale for this jurisdiction and this will be reflected in my order.
11. What of the issue of two counsel? This would ordinarily be a matter for
the discretion of the taxing officer. However, the Regulations
do not make any
provision for a taxing officer and for the taxation of costs. Rather, as I
interpret the Regulations, it is intended
by Regulation 14(1) that the Tribunal
be responsible, not only for making a cost order but also for assessing the
amount of costs
payable under that order. It follows, in my view, that it is
legitimate for the Tribunal, at this point, to make a determination
upon whether
the respondent’s costs should include the costs of two counsel, in this
case a senior counsel and a junior of
considerable experience.
inquiry to be made has been explained by Barwick CJ in Stanley v Phillips
[1966] HCA 24
115 CLR 470
at 479 in these terms:
emphasis throughout is upon obtaining an adequate presentation to enable justice
to be done: it is not upon the propriety
of the steps taken by a litigant to
ensure the maximum of success in his own cause. That of course he may do but
not....at his opponent’s
expense....[The question is not whether] a man in
seeking his own maximum advantage would be imprudent not to engage counsel of a
particular level of experience or skill. The question is whether the services
of more than one counsel are reasonably necessary
for the adequate presentation
of the case.”
13. Factors which have influenced the courts in determining the
reasonableness of a party retaining multiple counsel have been identified
Pont in Law of Costs 2nd Ed at [17.77] where the author cites the
volume of material to be handled;
the number or
character of the witnesses to be examined;
the nature or
extent of the cross-examination required;
anticipated length of the case;
complexity or difficulty of its issues of fact or law, and of the required
presentations;
the extent of
the preparatory research of fact or law to be undertaken;
the level of
court at which the matter is heard;
importance of the outcome to the parties;
involvement of charges of fraud, or other serious imputations of personal
reputation or integrity; and
the general
practice in matters of the kind in question.”
14. The case at hand is essentially a running-down case. It
was heard by the Tribunal, an “inferior court” to use Zeeman
J’s phrase in Trident, and was concluded within four days. I acknowledge
that it did require the close consideration of some
scientific evidence related
to the association between low-speed crashes and cervical injury. It required
too the consideration
of a reasonable volume of medical material and the
exploration with expert witnesses of reasonably complex medical issues.
I accept that the first reference did give rise to a statutory
interpretation issue which required counsel’s consideration.
However, it
is my overall view that the litigation did not involve a level of volume or
complexity which was beyond the reasonable
capacity of senior counsel to
competently manage unaided. It is relevant to observe that the applicant was
most ably represented
by a sole, albeit well experienced junior counsel. In
these circumstances I determine that the respondent’s costs for counsel
should be confined to senior counsel only and should not include the costs of
junior counsel.
15. For the foregoing reasons there will be an order that
the applicant pay 85% of the respondent’s costs upon both references,
those costs to be at the rate of 85% of the fees set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1
to the Supreme Court Rules 2000. The costs of the
respondent’s junior
counsel should not be part of its costs.
