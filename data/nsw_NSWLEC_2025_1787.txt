s 34(3) of the LEC Act, I must dispose of the proceedings in accordance with the
parties’ decision if that decision is
one that the Court could have made
in the proper exercise of its functions. The parties’ decision involves
the Court exercising
the function under s 4.16 of the EPA Act to grant consent
to the development application. There are jurisdictional prerequisites

and explained. From this I note the following
development application was made with the written consent of the owner of the
application was adequately notified from 13–27 June 2024. Three
submissions were received, and two residents from the same
property made oral
submissions at the commencement of proceedings. Based on the amended
application, the parties submit, and I accept,
that the development as amended
adequately responds to the concerns raised in these submissions, particularly in
relation to mitigating

(Biodiversity
and Conservation) 2021 (Biodiversity and Conservation SEPP)
applies. From the parties’ submission and the concept
design by Pantanial Consulting dated 23 September 2025 (stormwater
plans), I accept that the requirements of Ch 6 of the Biodiversity
Conservation SEPP relating to water quality and quantity (s 6.6), aquatic
ecology (s 6.7), and flooding (s 6.8) are met by the
proposed development.
I further accept that the proposed development does not affect public access to

(s 6.9), is not likely to have any adverse
environmental impact on any adjacent local government areas (s 6.10), and is not
within 100m of a natural waterbody in a regulated catchment (s

development as amended, accompanies the application.
4.6 of the State Environmental Planning Policy (Resilience and Hazards)
2021 requires the consent authority to consider whether
the site is
contaminated, and if so, whether it will be suitable for the intended use. Based
on the parties’ submissions and
the information contained in the
Statement of Environmental Effects prepared by Cracknell & Lonergan
Architects Pty Ltd dated
20 May 2024 I accept that the land has
historically been used for residential purposes, is not likely to be
contaminated and is suitable
for the proposed development.

consistent with the objectives of this

site area, and a maximum site coverage of
60% of the total site area. The
proposed development complies with both of these development standards as

proposed development complies with this development
standard with a maximum FSR
site is not identified as a heritage item but is located within the Annandale
Heritage Conservation Area (HCA). The parties submit,
and I accept that due to
the retention of the front, street-facing portion of the existing dwelling and
the amendments to the rear
additions, the impact of the amended application on
the heritage significance of the HCA is acceptable pursuant to IWLEP cl 5.10.
site is also identified as a flood control lot. From the Flood Risk Management
Report and Flood Risk Plans by Wehbe Consulting,
all dated 8 October 2025, and
the parties’ submissions, I accept that the proposed development meets the
flood-related requirements
of IWLEP cl 5.21.
to IWLEP cl 6.1, the site is identified as Class 5 on the Acid Sulfate Soils
Map, but is not within 500m of any land Classed
as 1, 2, 3 or 4 land, nor does
it comprise works below 5m Australian Height Datum. Accordingly, an acid sulfate
soils management
plan is not required and the requirements of IWLEP cl 6.1 have
proposed development includes earthworks. From the parties’ submissions
and the information contained in the Geotechnical
Investigation and Geotechnical
Report by Green Geotechnics dated 23 September 2025, I accept that the proposed
earthworks are acceptable
when considered against the matters listed in IWLEP cl
on the information contained in the amended application, particularly the
stormwater plans, I accept that the stormwater management
of the proposed
development meets the requirements of IWLEP cl 6.3.
these reasons, I am satisfied that the parties’ decision is one that the
Court could have made in the proper exercise of
its functions and that
therefore, I am required under s 34(3) of the LEC Act to dispose of the
proceedings in accordance with the
parties’ decision.
