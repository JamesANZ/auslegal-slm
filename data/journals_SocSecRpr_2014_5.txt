TRELOAR and SECRETARY to the DSS
Consideration
Formal decision
Disability support pension: whether lump sum payments received are
'compensation' or 'ordinary income'
TRELOAR and SECRETARY to the DSS
Decided: 19th December 2013 by K. Bean
Treloar’s disability support pension (DSP) was cancelled on 23 August
2011 following receipt of two lump sum payments from the
Super SA Income
Protection Scheme. The first payment of $15,930.86 was received on 22 December
2010 and the second payment of $37,313
on 22 August 2011.
Centrelink treated the payments as ordinary income apportioned over a 12
month period from the date of receipt of each of the payments.
The result was
that when Treloar’s deemed fortnightly income was calculated having regard
to the apportioned fortnightly amounts
derived from both the first and second
lump sum payments, his income exceeded the limit for DSP and for this reason the
payment was
1. What was the correct characterisation of the lump sum payments received by
Treloar, and in particular, were they correctly regarded
as ‘ordinary
income’ or ‘compensation’ within the meaning of the
Security Act 1991
(the Act)?; and
2. Was Treloar’s DSP correctly cancelled from 23 August 2011?
Section 1072
of the Act provides for the general meaning of the phrase
‘ordinary income’ as follows:
General meaning of ordinary income
A reference in this Act to a person’s ordinary income for a period is a
reference to the person’s gross ordinary income
from all sources for the
period calculated without any reduction, other than a reduction under Division
Section 1073
provides that certain lump sum amounts are taken to have been
received over 12 months.
Subsection 17(2)
provides for the meaning of the term
‘compensation’ for the purposes of the Act as follows:
Subject to subsection (2B), for the purposes of this ACT, compensation means:
(a) a payment of damages; or
(b) a payment under a scheme of insur-ance or compensation under a
Com-monwealth, State or Territory law, in-cluding a payment under
entered into under such a scheme; or
(c) a payment (with or without admission of liability) in settlement of a
claim for damages or a claim under such an insurance scheme;
(d) any other compensation or damages payment;
(whether the payment is in the form of a lump sum or in the form of a series
of period-ic payments and whether it is made within or
outside Australia) that
is made wholly or partly in respect of lost earnings or lost capa-city to earn
resulting from personal injury.
Subsection 17(2A)
also relevantly provides as follows:
Paragraph (2)(d) does not apply to a compensation payment if:
(a) the recipient has made contributions (for example, by way of insurance
premiums) towards the payment; and
(b) either:
(i) the agreement under which the contributions are made does not provide for
the amounts that would otherwise be payable under the
agreement being reduced or
not payable because the recipient is eligible for or receives payments un-der
this Act that are compens-ation
affected payments; or
(ii) the agreement does so provide but the compensation payment has been
calculated without reference to the provision.
Consideration
The Tribunal determined that, as the lump sums were paid pursuant to a
con-tract or arrangement entered into under a State law and
that the payments
were made in respect of lost earnings ‘resulting from personal
injury’, they must there-fore be regarded
as compensation with-in the
of the Act.
The Department had submitted that it would be an ‘unsatisfactory
interpretation of the Act’ for the payments to be re-garded
‘compensation’ under
(b) when they might be excluded from
the operation of
for example, because Treloar had made contributions
to the payments. The Tribunal rejected this submission, concluding that even
Treloar had made contributions towards the payments for the purposes of
it did not prevent the payments from be-ing ‘compensation’ within
the meaning of
s.17(2)(b).
The Tribunal found that the payments squarely fell
within the description contained in
and that it did not appear to be
the intention of the Act that a payment which was expressly excluded from
was also excluded from
The Tribunal further noted that its conclusion was consistent with the policy
reflected in the Department’s Guide to the Social
Security Law, in so far
as it provides that: Periodic and/or lump sum payments made under an income
protection or sickness and accident
policy..... ARE compensation for the
purposes of the SSAct if they are made in respect of lost earnings or lost
capacity to earn.
The Tribunal decided that it was not in a position to
determine whether Treloar’s DSP should have been suspended rather than
cancelled as it was first necessary for the Department to recalculate
Treloar’s entitlement to DSP based on the lump sum payments
being assessed
as compensation.
Formal decision
The decision under review was set aside and in substitution for that decision
it was decided that:
(a) the lump sum payments received by Treloar on 22 December 2010 and 22
August 2011 were to be treated as ‘compensation’
for the purposes of
the Act; and
(b) the matter was remitted to the Department for redetermination and
recalculation of Treloar’s entitlements accordingly.
