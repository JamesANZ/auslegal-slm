APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
Self-represented
Respondent:
E Ballard, solicitor
REASONS FOR DECISION
applicant, Bronwyn Hanrahan, has filed an appeal against a decision of the
Racing Appeals Panel made on 26 June 2025 pursuant
Integrity Act
(Qld) (‘RI Act’) – to confirm a
racing decision of the Stewards to impose a penalty on Ms Hanrahan.
[2] On 26 May
2025 the penalty imposed by the Stewards was:
(a) for charge one a fine of $6,000.00;
(b) for charges two and three a fine of $6,000.00 for each charge and a
suspension of licence for a period of 12 months for each
(c) the penalties for charges two and three suspended for a period of two years,
conditional upon Ms Hanrahan not being found in
breach of any matters relating
to a prohibited substance during that time.
[3] Ms Hanrahan
seeks a stay of the Racing Appeals Panel’s decision.
[4] To succeed
in a stay application Ms Hanrahan must show a reasonably arguable case, that she
would be materially disadvantaged
without a stay, and that the balance of
convenience favours the granting of a
application will be considered pursuant to
Queensland Civil and
Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(Qld) (‘QCAT Act’).
Submissions
application stresses that Ms Hanrahan does not believe she should have to pay a
$6,000.00 fine for “something I haven’t
done”. Ms Hanrahan
says she cannot obtain her licence until the fine is paid or a payment plan is
entered into.
[7] Ms Hanrahan
says that without her licence she is unable to train four horses. That is said
to impact the horses and her ability
to earn an income. Ms Hanrahan says that if
her licence is not renewed in a given time frame, with the advantage of a stay
decision, she may be treated as a new applicant which will cause further
delay before she secures her licence.
[8] Plainly the
focus of Ms Hanrahan’s desire for a stay, is a stay of the requirement to
pay the $6,000.00 fine rather than
the suspension of her licence.
[9] By reference
to s 252AU(1) of the RI Act, the respondent Queensland Racing Integrity
Commission (‘QRIC’) raises two
impediments to the appeal and to the
application for a stay of the Racing Appeals Panel’s decision:
(a) Ms Hanrahan was not a party to a proceeding in which the Racing Appeals
Panel imposed disqualification as a penalty; and
(b) A monetary fine does not fall within the meaning of “disqualification
Statutory framework
s 252AU of the RI Act a party may appeal to the Queensland Civil and
Administrative Tribunal (‘QCAT’) Appeal Tribunal
against a Racing
Appeals Panel decision “only on a question of law relating to the extent
of the disqualification action”.
[11] Disqualification
action is defined in s 252AA of the RI Act:
disqualification action
, against a person, means action
(a) is disciplinary action relating to the person’s approval or licence
or exclusion action against the person; and
(b) prevents the person from doing any of the following for a period of 3
months or longer–
(i) attending a race meeting;
(ii) betting;
(iii) bookmaking;
(iv) racing an animal
disciplinary
action to suspend the licence of a licence holder for an animal for 3
disciplinary
action to cancel the licence of a licence holder
exclusion action
to warn off a person from entering, or remaining at, a racecourse for 6
[12] Disciplinary
action is defined in sch 1 to the RI Act:
disciplinary action
, relating to an approval or licence, means 1
or more of the following– (relevantly):
(b) suspending the ... licence for a stated period;
(d) for a licence–
(i) imposing a monetary penalty; or
What do the sections mean?
construction issue arises in the definition of disqualification action. Does the
definition include a monetary penalty, which
is defined as disciplinary action?
Or, relevant to these facts, is disqualification action limited to the type of
disciplinary action
which prevents a person from racing an animal for a period
of 3 months or longer?
[14] To adopt
the former construction the legislature must have intended that disqualification
action may mean either (a) or (b) for
the purpose of pt 4 of the RI Act. This
construction does not have the effect of reading “and” as
“and” gives a cumulative effect to the
definition so that all the matters mentioned in the sub-paragraphs indicate what
is meant by disqualification action – but a dispersive effect is given to
the sub-paragraphs by the word “means”.
That is sub-paragraph (a)
and sub-paragraph (b) are each an example of disqualification
construction gives rise to an internal inconsistency. Although that construction
would catch a monetary penalty it would
also catch all suspensions of a licence
for any period of time. Sub-paragraph (b) makes it clear that the legislature
only intended
a right of appeal to the QCAT Appeal Tribunal where a suspension
is for a period of 3 months or longer. The two cannot stand together.
Acts Interpretation Act
(Qld) I may consider extrinsic
material to assist interpretation if a provision is ambiguous.
Explanatory Notes to the
Racing Integrity Amendment Bill 2022
(Qld) provide that
s 252AU of the RI Act limits the matters that a party dissatisfied with the
Racing Appeals Panel’s decision
on their review application may appeal to
the QCAT Appeal Tribunal. The Explanatory Notes provide that appealable
decisions are limited
to a decision of the Racing Appeals Panel which includes
disqualification action, which is a disciplinary action relating to the
person’s approval or licence or exclusion action against the person that
prevents a person from betting, bookmaking, racing
an animal or attending a race
meeting for 3 months or longer, and only on a question of law relating to the
disqualification action.
approach is said to be justified because an objective of establishing the Racing
Appeals Panel as an independent review panel
is to finalise review applications
in a short timeframe.
[19] On this
analysis disqualification action does not include a monetary penalty.
Can a stay be granted in relation to payment of a fine?
[20] Because
of the meaning I have given to “disqualification action” I conclude
that an appeal in relation to the fines
imposed on Ms Hanrahan cannot be
allowed. As a result, no reasonably arguable case with respect to the appeal can
be put and no stay
is available in aid of the final determination of the

suspension of a licence?
will deal now with the other objection to a stay raised by QRIC, that is, Ms
Hanrahan was not subject to disqualification as
[22] Although Ms
Hanrahan has not framed her application for a stay by reference to the
suspensions imposed on her, I will for completeness
deal with the issue.
submission is that a penalty of a twelve-month suspension, wholly suspended for
a period of two years in relation to the
second and third offences does not
“prevent” Ms Hanrahan from engaging in the activities set out in s
252AA(b) of the
[24] It is true
that provided there is no finding of breach of any matters relating to a
prohibited substance during the period of
two years from imposition of the
penalties, Ms Hanrahan will not be prevented from racing an animal. However, I
do not accept that
a disqualification has not been imposed on Ms Hanrahan which
will prevent her from racing an animal for a period of longer than 3
There has been a finding of guilt and the imposition of a penalty by
disciplinary action. That does not change simply because
enforcement is
If there was a breach of
the terms of the suspension then Ms Hanrahan would be prevented from racing an
animal for a period of twelve
[25] I conclude
that a wholly suspended suspension falls within the definition of
“disqualification action” under s 252AA
of the RI Act for the
purposes of s 252AU of the RI Act.
[26] Ms Hanrahan
does have a right to bring the appeal she seeks to pursue; however, the scope of
the appeal is very limited. Ms Hanrahan
has made no submission as to an error of
law on the part of the Racing Appeals Panel in relation to the extent of the
penalty. Ms
Hanrahan has not shown a reasonably arguable case on appeal.
[27] As the
suspensions are not currently being enforced, I do not consider Ms Hanrahan has
suffered a detriment or that the balance
of convenience falls in her favour.
Once she pays her fine Ms Hanrahan should be able to race animals pursuant to
her licence. There
is no utility in a stay in those circumstances.
submit that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to make the orders sought by Ms
Hanrahan to have the finding of guilt set
aside and for the horse to be
reinstated to its placings and the prizemoney paid.
[29] It is not
necessary for the purpose of this decision to explore the extent of the Appeal
Tribunal’s jurisdiction on a final
determination. That will involve
consideration of the meaning of “only on a question of law relating to the
extent of the disqualification

amendments to the RI Act intended to limit rights of appeal to the Tribunal are
relatively new, there is little guidance
from the cases on the meaning of those
[31] I note that
Ms Hanrahan has filed an appeal book, however she has not addressed the question
of law which arises in this matter.
I intend to conduct a Directions Hearing on
a date to be advised where the following issues will be discussed:
(a) whether the material in Ms Hanrahan’s appeal book includes only
evidence before the Racing Appeals Panel or whether additional
evidence is
sought to be relied upon.
(b) what question of law relating to the extent of disqualification is raised in
this matter.
[32] The last
question raises difficult concepts on which Ms Hanrahan may wish to seek
The application for a stay of the decision of the
Racing Appeals Panel made on 26 June 2025 is refused.
