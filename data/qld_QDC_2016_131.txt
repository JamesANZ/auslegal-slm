Introduction
[1] On 2 November 2015, after a short one day
hearing in the Maroochydore Magistrates Court on 9 September 2015, her Honour
Hennessy found the respondent (Mr Leo) not guilty of 3 counts of
fraud on the ground of unsoundness of mind. The complainant police
officer has
appealed against the dismissal of the charges and an order for costs setting out
in his initial notice of appeal, (5)
grounds in all.
[2] On 2 March 2016 an
amended notice of appeal was filed abandoning all grounds relating to the
dismissal of the charges and seeking
to agitate only two grounds relating to
costs (the second of which was an additional ground):
• Her Honour
erred in classifying the matter as involving special difficulty, complexity or
importance when determining appropriate
• She erred in not
using, as a guide, the costs allowed for as per the scale of costs in the
Justices Regulation 2004 when awarding
costs under
Justices Act
[3] The last ground as I have said was added, and Mr Leo does not
object to it being added as a ground of appeal, and I give leave
appellant to add that ground.
[4] It follows that there is no reason to
explore further the remaining grounds, and, in particular the ground that her
Honour “erred
by applying the incorrect test in determining the elements
of ‘dishonesty’ and ‘intention’ when concluding
prosecution had not proved ‘intention’ beyond a reasonable
[5] As indicated at the hearing, and as agreed by the parties,
I do intend to say something about the appropriate test in charges
dishonesty is an element, which I hope, will assist both Prosecutors and
Magistrates in relation to such charges.
A brief summary of
[6] Essentially there were (3) counts of fraud described in the Bench
Charge sheets as being pursuant to s 408C(1)(A)(1) of the Criminal
section is s 408C(1)(a)(i).
[7] It was common ground that Mr Leo had been
employed by the complainant BMD Constructions Pty Ltd trading as BMD
Constructions.
He was injured at work on 9 February 2013 in a motor
vehicle accident, and was on workers’ compensation leave at the time
committed the offences. On (3) separate occasions the complainant inadvertently
paid into Mr Leo’s bank account sums of
money which he then applied to his
[8] By way of example, the first payment was made on 3 April 2013,
and on 4 April 2013 Mr Leo had applied all that money to his use
($17,871.53).
The same thing happened on 11 April 2013 ($18,218.65), and 18 April 2013
($18,218.65). The mistake was discovered
in early July, and Mr Leo ignored
demand letters and phone calls and subsequently declared himself bankrupt in
September 2013.
[9] The first charge is pleaded in the following
day of April 2013 at Buderim ... (Mr Leo) ... dishonestly
applied to his own use the sum of $17,871.53 belonging to BMD Constructions
Proprietary Limited trading as BMD Constructions.”
[10] In relation to each charge, Mr Leo admitted all elements
by way of formal admissions under s 644 of the Criminal Code except
element of “dishonesty”.
[11] The factual issue impacting on this
element was said to be Mr Leo’s state of mind at the time he applied the
[12] Her Honour (at page 7 – lines 3-5) in dealing with the
element of dishonesty said, after referring to the evidence about
state of mind, “on the basis of forming an intent to dishonestly deprive
the employer of the money, ... there
isn’t sufficient evidence beyond
reasonable doubt as to that element of the offence”. It would have made
no difference
to the outcome, as her Honour then proceeded to deal with the
unsoundness of mind defence, and found Mr Leo not guilty on the ground
unsoundness of mind, however to ensure that the correct test is applied in the
future, reference should be made to R v Dillon;
Ex-parte Attorney-General
, in which the Court of Appeal, on a reference by the Attorney General,
brought Queensland Law into line with the approach taken in
relation to Federal
offending involving charges which have “dishonesty” as an element of
the offence: Peters v The Queen
[1998] HCA 7
(1998) 192 CLR 493
, so that the prosecution need
only prove that what the defendant did was dishonest by the standards of
ordinary people. In so doing,
the Court did not follow the two stage test that
Queensland Courts had applied (despite Peters) since R v Ghosh
[1982] EWCA Crim 2
[1982] QB 1053
so it follows that proof of the element of dishonesty does not involve proof of
any subjective realisation by the defendant as to
what he or she was doing was
dishonest, so intention does not come into a consideration of this particular
element of a charge under
s 408C. Intention may come into play in relation to
the element of “applied”: R v Easton
[1993] QCA 255
[1994] 1 Qd.R. 531
, but as that
was admitted in this case, it is of no consequence.
[13] The relevant sections of the
Justices Act 1886
Costs on dismissal
(1) When justices instead of convicting or making an order dismiss the
complaint, they may by their order of dismissal order that
the complainant shall
pay to the defendant such costs as to them seem just and reasonable.”
158(A) Exercise of discretion in relation to an award of costs
(1) Despite
, justices who dismiss a complaint may make an order for
costs in favour of a defendant against a complainant who is a police officer
public officer only if the justices are satisfied that it is proper that the
order for costs should be made.”
Section 158A(2)
then sets out a number of matters that the
Court must take into account in exercising the discretion including “all
circumstances”. ...
158B Costs for division
(1) In deciding the costs that are just and reasonable for this division, the
justices may award costs only -
(a) for an item allowed for this division under a scale of costs prescribed
under a regulation; and
(b) up to the amount allowed for the item under the scale.
(2) However, the justices may allow a higher amount for costs if the justices
are satisfied that the higher amount is just and reasonable
having regard to the
special difficulty, complexity or importance of the case.”
[14] After she had delivered her decision dismissing the
complaint on 2 November 2015 her Honour heard a full argument from both parties
in relation to costs. She then adjourned for a number of hours to consider the
arguments before giving her costs decision.
[15] As her substantive reasons
for dismissing the charge reveal, the trial proceeded quickly. Exhibit 1 was a
set of admissions.
The only issue was whether the prosecution could prove the
element of dishonesty beyond a reasonable doubt; and if it could, whether
could satisfy her Honour on the balance of probabilities that at the time he
committed the 3 offences he was in a state of
mental disease or natural
infirmity such that he was deprived of one or more of the capacities to
understand what he was doing, to
control his actions, or to know that he ought
not do the act.
[16] Despite the admissions, the Prosecutor nevertheless
called a representative of the complainant company to prove that once the
overpayments had been discovered, contact was attempted with Mr Leo by telephone
and by letter with no success leading up to a complaint
to police in September
2013, at or around the time the complainant became aware of Mr Leo’s
bankruptcy.
[17] The evidence touching on the
issue was lead through
clinical neuropsychologist Dr Jeanne Georgius whose curriculum vitae was
tendered as Exhibit 4. Dr Georgius
holds a number of academic qualifications
including a doctor of psychology in clinical neuropsychology, and was
predominantly involved
in medico-legal assessments of traumatic brain injury
cases. The evidence before her Honour established that Mr Leo was involved
work related motor vehicle accident in February 2013; and CT brain scans and an
MRI reveal “some residual effects consistent
with a traumatic brain
injury”. He was referred to Dr Georgius for a neuropsychological
assessment in May 2013, and she assessed
him over (3) days on 30 May 2013, and 6
June 2013, and interviewed him again for “feedback” on 20 June
2013. Her report
to the referring doctor dated 21 June 2013 was admitted as
Exhibit 6. As the report reveals, she conducted a series of assessment
and interviewed both Mr Leo and his girlfriend. She assessed him as having
suffered a mild and moderate traumatic brain injury
in February 2013. She
indicates that most recovery occurs by 6 months post head injury but that
process continues for 12-36 months with
a maximal improvement at 3 years post
Clearly, at that stage, she was not considering the
capacities.
[18] Ultimately, she was engaged by Mr Bradley on behalf of Mr
Leo, and her trial report was admitted and marked Exhibit 8. She noted
misuse of the overpaid funds had occurred approximately two months after Mr Leo
had sustained the brain injury, and that
her assessments were conducted (5)
months post injury. She opined “Given the severity and nature of the
symptoms and the fact
that Mr Leo had sustained a significant traumatic
brain injury and was in the post-concussion stage in April 2013, it is my
that he was deprived of the capacity to both understand what he was
doing and to control his actions in April 2013.” She also
opined (not
surprisingly) in her evidence before her Honour, that his cognitive functioning
including his memory would have improved
by June 2014 when he was interviewed by
[19] By far the most time taken up in the hearing was in the
cross-examination of Dr Georgius by the Prosecutor.
[20] At the close of
the defence case, the Prosecutor sought to adjourn the hearing to enable it to
call rebuttal evidence in relation
to the neuropsychological evidence. This was
rightly refused, as the prosecution had been provided with a report in February
at a pre-trial mediation hearing. The Prosecutor sought leave to tender
and play the record of an interview to that dated 24 June
2014 and leave was
granted and the interview became Exhibit 10. In my opinion, this was contrary
to the long established principle,
that the prosecution should not be entitled
to split its case: R v Chin
[1985] HCA 35
(1985) 157 CLR 671.
Here, the issue of the record
of interview was discussed at the start of the trial. It was conceded by the
Prosecutor that it contained
no admissions. If the Prosecutor regarded it as
relevant to the confined issues in the case which were then clearly articulated
by Mr Lewis on behalf of Mr Leo, he should have tendered it as part of his case.
Evidence of this kind should only be permitted to
be called in exceptional
circumstances, and generally speaking not if the occasion for calling the
further evidence ought reasonably
to have been foreseen by the prosecutor: R v
[2003] HCA 13
(2003) 196 ALR 421.
Nothing turns on this as the ruling was favourable to
the appellant.
Her Honours’ costs ruling
[21] At the conclusion of
the hearing on 9 September 2015, as I have noted, her Honour reserved her
decision until 2 November 2015
when she dismissed the charges. She then heard
argument in relation to costs and adjourned again until the afternoon when she
costs of $12,080 in Mr Leo’s favour. Her costs decision commences
on page 21 of the November transcript.
[22] There is no argument advanced by
the appellant that her Honour erred in holding that pursuant to
proper that an order for costs be made.
[23] There is no argument that for
the reasons she gave (relating really to
s 158A(2)(b))
that the discretion to
award costs was not enlivened.
[24] Her Honour then went on to consider
Her reasons for awarding a higher amount are set out from pages 25 to
27 of the transcript. In relation to “special difficulty”
this (after referring to the
does take it somewhat out of the realm of the ordinary. It certainly takes it
out of the ordinary preparation for fraud
charges to have to seek and rely on
expert evidence of that nature. Whilst a difficulty [sic] is a word that can be
interpreted
a number of ways, it certainly creates special circumstances in
relation to the defence of this particular case; [sic] difficulty
to the extent
that it necessitates the incurrence of additional costs.”
[25] In relation to the issue of “special
importance,” her Honour said at (26):
“The defence base their primary submission in
relation to the higher amount of costs being just and reasonable on the last
consideration
in subsection (2) which was the importance of the case. The
defence argued that it was effectively a public policy issue, that the
in this case was in a position of significant disadvantage as – following
his involvement in a work accident which
left him with a serious acquired brain
injury, that it wasn’t the defence said a situation where the defendant
had, through
lifestyle choices, placed himself in a position of incurring that
injury and that the public policy issue was that the arresting
officer and
thereafter the prosecuting authority did not give sufficient weight to the
significant disadvantage and the nature of
the disadvantage that the defendant
was placed in.
The prosecution had objected and argued the case in relation to
the issue of importance on the basis of every case being important
particular defendant and that this case was not out of the ordinary in relation
to its importance, either to the defendant
or to the community generally. It
was, in its essence, facts are fairly straightforward for the prosecution. This
is not a matter
of the case being of particular importance to the defendant,
although obviously it would be.
However, I do note that the defendant is not
shirking his responsibility per se in relation to the owing of this money, but
told the police in the first instance that he considered it to be a civil
issue. But it seems to me that this is not a consideration
relating to any
particular importance ascribed to the case for the defendant, but I do accept
the defence submission that on a public
policy basis that consideration should
have been given to the particular disadvantage that the defendant was placed in
came to be in that position.
I guess to a lesser extent, although
this was not argued by the defence, it is specifically in relation to this
issue, but the issue
of whether or not there was good faith on the part of the
complainant in not loaning the complainant in the first place in the
circumstances,
could also be a consideration for the Queensland Police Service
on that public policy basis.”
[26] On appeal, Mr Leo accepts the
principles that apply in such cases as discussed in the appellant’s
outline filed 21 January
2016. It is accepted therefore that
“special” qualifies “difficulty, complexity, and
importance” in the
exercise of the discretion to award a higher amount
Palmgrove Holdings Pty Ltd v Sunshine Coast Regional Council
[2014] QDC 77
, in which his Honour Judge Long, SC quoted with approval
from Travers v McDonagh; Carey v La Rocca
[2013] QDC 177
[27] In the case of Allison v Channel Seven Queensland Pty Ltd
[2015] QDC 111
, his Honour Judge Morzone SC allowed an appeal against an award
of costs of $20,000. It was not sufficient that the case was “of
importance” to the party. His Honour considered the test:
an objective one of whether the difficulty, complexity or importance of the
particular case at hand surpasses what is common or
usual in an ordinary case.
The inquiry ought not be directed to subjective importance of the case to the
respective parties
His Honour found that case was:
not one that raised any important point of law, nor any question of
public importance that is likely to arise again either frequently
or at all, nor
is the result one that involves any manifest injustice. Whilst the case touched
upon matters of freedom of speech,
that was not unusual in the circumstances.
The legal issues were comparatively narrow
[28] Judge Morzone (at [28]) referred to, and agreed with
comments his Honour Judge Farr SC, DCJ made in the case of Whitby v Stockair
[2015] QDC 79
where he affirmed his earlier decision of Cullinane
[2014] QDC 120
where he said:
“... I accept that this case
was important to the appellant, as no doubt every criminal case is to every
defendant. To invoke
special importance however, the case must involve more
than the charge merely relating to a defendant in his/her professional capacity.
‘Special importance’ is clearly a reference to the importance of the
case generally, in terms of questions of law or
public interest (this list is
not exhaustive) and is not intended to refer to the subjective assessment of a
defendant as to whether
the case is important to him or
[29] Although her Honour’s reasons referred to above are
somewhat equivocal about the issue of “special difficulty”,
with the appellant that in stating that the
issue takes “it somewhat
out of the realm of the ordinary”, her Honour misdirected herself as to
the threshold that was
required by reference to authority. It may be unusual
defence to be raised in the Magistrates Court, but, in this case the
issue was greatly simplified by the approach of the parties.
The trial lasted
less than a day. The prosecution evidence took 9 minutes. Dr Georgious gave
evidence for 59 minutes most of which
was in cross-examination. There were no
objectively especially difficult aspects of the case. “Unusual” is
not synonymous
with “difficulty” and, in any event, this was not a
case that involved special difficulty, including having regard to
the reversal
of onus issue that does arise from time to time e.g.
s 129(1)(c)
Misuse Act 1986
[30] In deciding that the case was of “special
importance”, her Honour has impermissibly conflated matters relevant to
the exercise of discretion under s 158(2)(a), with the concept of “special
importance” referred to in s 158B(2). She
did not hold that the
proceeding was brought or continued in bad faith, and it was therefore an error
to use that as a basis for
holding that the case was of “special
importance”. It is clear, when one has regard to the authorities, that
not a case that went beyond the importance of a case to Mr Leo into
general importance “in terms of questions of law or public
[31] In awarding a higher amount under s 158B(2), her Honour
erred in taking into account irrelevant matters in the House v R
(1936) 55 CLR
sense, and the appeal should be allowed on that basis.
[32] It follows
that it is not necessary for me to determine the additional ground which was
added relating to the Justice Regulation
2004. The regulation is reproduced at
[73] of Palmgrove Holdings. Clearly, when a Magistrate decides to act under s
158B(2), reference
nevertheless should be had to the appropriate scale (in this
case the regulation) and not to a quantum that was “within the
appropriateness in the normal course of such proceedings”. In Durrant v
[2000] QDC 198
, Judge McGill observed that “when a statutory
scale is provided then the starting point is always the amount of costs is to
in accordance with the scale prescribed, and even when there is a discretion to
award a larger amount, the prescribed scale should
be used as guide to the
proper exercise of the discretion”.
[33] The appeal is allowed. The
costs order made below is set aside, otherwise Her Honour’s orders remain
place. I invite
the parties to submit orders as to the costs to be awarded
below and on appeal. As a matter of common-sense, the respective orders
cancel each other out but I will leave that to the parties.
