Occupiers Liability
Report No 2 of the Community Law Reform Committee of the
Australian Capital Territory. This Report reflects the law as at February
Committee Reference: CLRC No 2.
The Community Law Reform Committee of the
Australian Capital Territory was established in June 1990. The purpose of the
is to assist the Government to identify areas in need of reform,
anticipate emerging social and legal issues and assess the practical
various proposals and laws on the people of the ACT. The Committee's Office and
Secretariat are at 3rd floor GIO Building,
City Walk, Canberra City ACT 2601
(Tel (06)2070546, fax (06)2070538).
This report examines whether:
(i) the courts determine occupiers liability cases solely according to the
general principles of negligence, or the rule in
Cavalier-v-Pope
works to reduce the liability of landlords; and
(ii) legislation is necessary to remove any doubt that the general principles
of negligence alone determine issues of occupiers
liability, in relation to
tenants and landlords.
The Report is a review of recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform
Commission in its report number 42 (1988).
The Committee agrees with the recommendation of the Commission that legislation
should be enacted to remove the rule in
Cavalier-v-Pope.
Draft legislation which would give effect to the recommendations appears in
Appendix A.
Introduction
1. This is the first of three reports by the Community Law Reform Committee which
review recommendations of the Australian Law
Reform Commission. Under the Community
Law Reform Program, established in 1984, the Commission prepared several reports
three on contributory negligence, action for loss of consortium and
occupiers liability. The Attorney-General requested the Committee
to review the
recommendations of the Commission on these areas and as a result the Committee
has now prepared a report on each.
The background to the recommendations of the
Commission and the consequent references to the Committee are detailed in the
report of the Committee, on contributory negligence
Terms of Reference
2. The Attorney-General requested this report in a reference to the Committee
signed on the 21st September 1990. The terms of
reference required the
Committee to review the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission
presented in its report
number 42 (1988). The Commission concluded that:
"the High Court decision in
Australian Safeway Stores-v-Zaluzna
resolved many of the difficulties of occupiers liability law and that the
general principles of negligence would now apply
in regard to occupiers'
liability cases"
and recommended that:
"legislation be enacted to remove any doubt in regard to landlord immunity
within the ACT. "
Submissions
3. In preparing this report the Committee made use of the collective experience
of its members, including those with expertise
in business, legal practice and
community welfare, to assess the impact of proposals on the ACT community.
4. An Issues Paper
on this area, prepared
by the Committee's Secretariat, was widely circulated and the Committee called
for submissions. Two
submissions were received:
. Mr J Marks, October 1990; and
. Welfare Rights and Legal Centre, October 1990.
5. The Committee also carefully considered the Commission's report number 42 on
this area and discussed these issues extensively
with Mr Nick Seddon who as
Commissioner in charge of the Community Law Reform Program, was a primary
contributor to the Commission's
report. Mr Seddon is a Commissioner of the
Australian Law Reform Commission as well as a member of this Committee.
Occupiers Liability
6. The decision of the High Court in
Australian Safeway Stores-v-Zaluzna
which determined that the common law principles
of negligence should apply to the facts of occupiers' liability cases, has resolved
many of the difficulties of occupiers' liability law.
7. However, the law in this area is not as clear with respect to a special
rule that arguably still applies to landlords. The
Cavalier-v-Pope
provides an immunity to landlords in respect
of occupiers' liability. A landlord may not be sued for injury done to a person
who enters onto leased premises even where the landlord is responsible for the
state of the premises.
Cavalier-v-Pope
was a case decided before an English Court in 1906.
The wife of the tenant fell through the kitchen floor and hurt herself. The
Court said that since the wife was not a party to the agreement between the
landlord and her husband she would be placed into the
same class of persons as
a licensee. As the landlord was not liable to the tenant's guests or customers
the wife did not have
a case and accordingly could not recover damages.
The Law in ACT
9. It is not clear whether the rule in
Cavalier-v-Pope
applies in the
ACT. If it does, tenants could be responsible for personal injury to people
(whether a dinner guest or a shopper
in a store) who come onto their leased
premises even if the defect in the premises that caused the injury is the
landlord's responsibility.
Recommendation
10. The Committee agrees with the recommendations of the Commission that the
relationship between occupiers of all classes, including
unauthorised entrants,
should be dealt with on the basis of applying the general principles of
negligence. However, the Committee
considers that it is necessary to enact
legislation to remove any doubt in regard to landlord immunity within the ACT.
Financial Considerations for the ACT Government
11. The implementation of these recommendations will not require the ACT
Government to incur any financial cost.
