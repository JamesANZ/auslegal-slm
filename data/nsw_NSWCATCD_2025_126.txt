REASONS FOR DECISION
3 November. 2023 the applicant filed a Dividing Fences Application in the
Tribunal against the respondent concerning fencing work
that she proposed. The
estimated cost of the fencing work to be carried out was $5,555.00 which was to
be paid by the respondent.
23 May 2025 the proceedings were set down for a hearing on 17 June 2025. At the
hearing, orders were made that the application
was dismissed because the
applicant had withdrawn the application. Orders were made in the event that a
party was minded to make
a costs application.
1 July 2025 the applicant filed costs submissions in which she sought an order
for costs pursuant to
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
, the ‘CAT Act’.
17 July 2025 the respondent served costs submissions in response to the
applicant’s submissions on costs dated 1 July 2025.
The respondent
submitted that the Tribunal should make a costs order against the applicant, or
alternatively, no order as to costs.
orders made on 17 June 2025 did not allow for Reply submissions. Despite that
the applicant filed submissions in Reply dated 18
July 2025. Because the
applicant did that on 25 July 2025, the respondent filed submissions in response
to the applicant’s
18 July 2025 submissions.
parties agreed to an order being made dispensing with a hearing under s50(2) of
the CAT Act and for the applicant’s costs
application to be dealt with on
the papers. I will make such an order.
Costs jurisdiction
60 of the CAT Act creates the general rule that each party to proceedings must
pay their own costs: s60(1). I may order costs
only “if satisfied that
there are special circumstances warranting an award of costs” (emphasis
added): s60(2). Section
60(3) sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors that may
be considered in deciding whether there are special circumstances warranting
award of costs.
term “special circumstances” is not defined by the
It has been interpreted to mean circumstances that are out of the ordinary, but
not necessarily extraordinary or exceptional. The
discretion to award costs must
be exercised judicially having regard to the underlying principle that parties
to proceedings in the
Tribunal are ordinarily to bear their own
applicant’s submissions set out in the relevant history of these
proceedings in a chronological order. I find that the relevant
(1) On 4 October 2023 the applicant served a fencing notice on the
respondent;
(2) On 3 November 2023, the applicant filed these proceedings;
(3) The applicants claim in the proceedings was amended to seek orders for the
costs of the fencing work to be shared equally between
the parties;
(4) The proceedings were listed for final hearing on 22 January 2024. There was
no appearance for the respondent;
(5) Senior Member Robertson, (as he was then) made final orders on 22 January
(6) On 18 March 2024 the respondent applied for, and on 10 April 2024 was
successful in obtaining orders to set aside the final orders
made by Senior
Member Robertson;
(7) The costs of the set aside were reserved in the 10 April orders;
(8) These proceedings were listed for further procedural directions to prepare
the case for a hearing after the set aside orders
(9) On 15 August 2024, the respondent filed a Class 2 application in the. Land
and Environment Court ‘LEC’. The orders
sought in the LEC including
an order that the applicant pay for the cost of a replacement fence between the
properties of the parties
in these proceedings’
(10) Because of the LEC proceedings the hearing in these proceedings was
adjourned from 4 September 2024 to at least 13 June 2025
when the LEC made a
decision that in connection with the dividing fence, the parties were to have a
dividing fence built and to pay
the costs in equal proportion.
(11) On 17 June 2025 at the Tribunal hearing, because of the LEC 13 June 2025
orders, Tribunal orders were made in that the application
was dismissed because
the applicant had withdrawn the application.
applicant seeks a costs order in these proceedings relying on:
(1) Section 60(3)(a) of the CAT Act, namely whether a party has conducted the
proceedings in a way that unnecessarily disadvantaged
another party to the
proceedings;
(2) Section 6(3)(b) of the CAT Act, namely whether a party has been responsible
for prolonging unreasonably the time taken to complete
the proceedings;
(3) Section 60(3)(c) of the CAT Act, namely the relative strengths of the claims
made by each of the parties including whether a
party has made a claim that has
no tenable basis in fact or law;
(4) Section 60(3)(d) of the CAT Act, namely the nature and complexity of the
proceedings.
(5) Section 60(3)(e) of the CAT Act, namely, whether the proceedings were
frivolous or vexatious or otherwise misconceived or lacking
in substance;
(6) Section 60(3)(f) of the CAT Act; namely, whether a party has refused or
failed to comply with the duty imposed by section by
section 36(3) of the CAT
(7) Section 60(3)(g) of the CAT Act, namely, any other matter that the Tribunal
considers relevant.
approach taken by the applicant to address every sub paragraph of s60(3) of the
CAT Act on a fairly narrow set of facts is not
particularly helpful. The parties
should restrict an application such as this to the most relevant facts and the
sub paragraph of
s60(3) which most closely responds to or reflects those
The respondent’s submissions
respondent states that the LEC proceedings were brought under the
(Disputes Between Neighbours) Act
and that the LEC had exclusive
respondent’s submissions otherwise deal with the history of the
proceedings, the LEC proceedings and deals with the jurisdiction
of the LEC to
make the orders that it did, and the orders actually made. Otherwise the
respondent engages with the submissions made
by the applicant in connection with
s60(3)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of the NCAT Act.
Respondent concludes that:
(a) The applicant has not established special circumstances under s60(2) of the
CAT Act against the respondent;
(b) Special circumstances under section s60(2) of the CAT Act have been
established against the applicant;
(c) The appropriate order is that the applicant should pay the respondents
(d) in the alternative each party should bear their own costs.
is not my intention to set out every submission made by the respondent or the
Reply submissions
previously stated, the orders made by the Tribunal did not allow for Reply
submissions. The applicant’s Reply submissions

respondent’s Reply submissions state
those of the applicant contain fresh
evidence and responds to the material that it contends falls within that
description.

decision Galwey AC stated:
‘In certain circumstances, proceedings under the
Dividing Fences
can be transferred to the Land and Environment Court, allowing for
orders for fencing work to be made in proceedings under the Trees
Act beyond the
section of fence damaged by a neighbouring tree:
Dividing Fences
At the applicant’s request, the parties and NCAT proceedings
are transferred to the Land and Environment Court to be determined

.’ (emphasis added)
The Owners – Strata Plan No. 8514 v Sydney Renovation Specialists Pty
(Unreported, NSWCATCD, 9 November 2020) I considered submissions
regarding the payment of costs on a transfer application. Paragraph
decision is relevant. It is:
‘The applicant has also referred to
Kadac Proprietary Limited v
Complete Health Products Pty Ltd & Ors
[2015] VSC 657
in which Sifris J
made an order that the costs of proceedings transferred to Queensland should be
in the cause. At [12] Sifris J
stated after considering a number of relevant
authorities on cases where the proper jurisdiction was an important issue:
‘In my opinion, in the absence of special circumstances, which would
include lack of jurisdiction or a very clear case, the
costs of a successful
transfer application should ordinarily be costs in the cause.’
Unfortunately,
I am critical of the applicant’s solicitors for not bringing [7] of the
decision in
Xiao v Yang
2025 NSWLEC 1417
to my attention in its
submissions of 1 July 2025. Nor did the respondent bring this important finding
to my attention in [19] –
[25] of her submissions.
accordance with what was stated in
Kadac Proprietary Limited v Complete
Health Products Pty Ltd & Ors
[2015] VSC 657
, I find that the costs of
these proceedings should be in the cause and determined by the LEC. This is
consistent with Clause 6(2)
of Schedule 4 of the CAT Act which states if there
were a transfer from the Tribunal to the LEC:
‘(1) If the parties in any proceedings for the exercise of a
Division function so agree, or if the Tribunal of its own motion
application of a party so directs, the proceedings are—
(a) to be transferred to a court (in accordance with the rules of
that court) that has jurisdiction in the matter, and
(b) to continue before that court as if the proceedings had been
instituted there.
proceedings are different in that there was no application in this Tribunal to
transfer the proceedings to the LEC. Nonetheless
they were transferred by the
LEC to be determined as part of the LEC proceedings. In my view the
determination of the proceedings
by the LEC, should include, inter alia, the
issue of the costs in the Tribunal.
that reason I will make an order that the costs in the Tribunal are to be in the
cause to be determined by the New South Wales
Land and Environment Court in
Xiao v Yang
2025 NSWLEC 1417

2024/00301322.
I hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for
