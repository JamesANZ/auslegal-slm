HEARING 6 February and 1 March 2001 at Newcastle
KEY WORDS Interim Orders, Appeals
The appeal is dismissed.
By appeal lodged with the registry on 24 November 2000 the appellant the
Owners SP 48754 sought to appeal the decision of the Adjudicator
made as interim
orders on 20 November 2000 in matter number SA00/00721. The following orders
1. I direct the owners corporation of SP48754 to affix its corporate seal to
the construction certificate application made by Cornucopia
Australia Pty Ltd on
behalf of P D Anderson Holdings Pty Ltd, being application 00/1089 relating to
the conversion of basement level
lot "..." in SP48754 as consented to in the
Development Consent issued in respect of Development Application
2. The seal is to be affixed no later than 5pm Friday, 24 November,
At the same time as lodging the appeal the
appellant sought a stay of the interim orders. The request for the stay was
declined by
the Adjudicator and reasons were given on 24 November 2000.
The grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant are that
1. Special by-law 2 is in place
2. It provides that lots "..." and "..." can only be used for residential
3. The terms of the by-law were not before the adjudicator
4. The adjudicator’s order was ultra vires as it required the owners
corporation to do an act inconsistent with the by-law
5. The decisions of Thompson v SP47175 and Regis Towers support the
appellant’s case as the owners corporation would be entitled
injunction to prevent the operation of a business in breach of the
The matters relied on by the respondent in defence of
the appeal are as follows
1. The development application was issued with the approval of the owners
corporation
2. To proceed with the construction a construction certificate is required from
the local council
3. There was no application before the Council or owners corporation dealing
with the proposed use of the premises. The issue of
what was to be built and
the issue of the use of the premises once built are separate
4. By-law 2 is in breach of the Act as it prevents residential occupation by any
person including persons under 18 years of age
5. The by law is void for uncertainty in respect of lot 10, it does not prevent
construction
6. The question of use is a matter for the council, Regis Towers case zoning not
The decision of Bryson J in Regis Towers Real
Estate Pty Limited v Kin Fung & Ors
[2000] NSWSC 438
dealt with an
application for an injunction to be imposed on each of the defendants, the
owners and lessee of a lot within a strata
scheme, to restrain breaches of the
registered by-laws of the scheme. Special by-law 1 for the scheme empowered the
owners corporation
to enter into an agreement and appoint a caretaker-manager to
provide management, leasing and other operational services for the
well as operating a letting property management and sales service. Special
by-law 4 provided that an owner or occupier
must not, except with the written
consent of the caretaker manager conduct a business which provides services in
the nature of a
letting agent or rent agency or other activity identical with
the services referred to in by-law 1.
Without knowing of the making of
the special by-laws the owners entered into a lease with the lessees, the
permitted use of the premises
being described as retailing shop subject to
Councils approval. The owners were aware prior to entering into the lease that
lessee intended to use the premises as a real estate agency and mortgage
originator. The lessee made an application to Sydney City
Council for
development consent for use of the premises for those purposes
evidence on behalf of the lessee at the hearing was that the lessee intended to
use the premises in the terms stated in the development
application. The Court
found that there was a threatened breach of Special by-law 4 and that an
injunction against both the owners
and the lessee to restrain the breaches was
the appropriate remedy.
The decision of Mr Cochrane, a former member of
the Board, in Thompson & Anor v The Owners SP47175 dealt with an application
enforce compliance with special by-laws which gave rights of exclusive use to
use an area of the common property for table seating
ancillary to the operation
of a take away bar. Mr Cochrane found that the relevant by-law prohibited the
occupier of the lot from
providing table service to persons seated on the common
property, and made orders restraining breach of the by-law. The appellant
argued that it is open to the oc to enforce the special by-laws even though they
deal with the use to which the premises are put.
The relevant facts are
as follows:
The respondent is the
registered owner of lot "...".
Registered on the strata
plan is an easement 1 metre wide as a right of footway over lot "..." giving in
effect access to the common
property in the centre of the lot which houses the
lift motor room and lift overrun pit.
The registered by-laws
include special by-law no 2 which provides as
"Lots "..." and "..." are to be used for non-residential commercial purposes
and the Body Corporate shall have the right to restrict
the trading hours in
respect of any commercial business operating within the building but in any
event the permitted trading hours
shall not be before 10.00 am or after 10.00pm
on any trading day.
• Lot "..." is zoned by Newcastle City Council 2(a) Residential Zone.
annual general meeting of the owners corporation of 10 February 1997 the owners
corporation made a special resolution approving
the respondent’s proposal
to subdivide lot "..." into two residential lots on certain conditions. One of
the conditions set
out in resolution 16 was that the respondent maintain an
unrestricted right of access to the lift motor room and storeroom for the
purposes of lift maintenance and repair in accordance with all statutory
requirements particularly the Workcover Act.
The motion to authorise
the managing agent to affix the seal to the development application amongst
other documents was deferred.
The plan presented to
the meeting, exhibit 3, showed a subdivision of the area into two residential
lots with the access way to the
lift motor room and lift overrun pit through a
passage way between the proposed lots.
It appears that the
plans which were submitted to Newcastle City Council with the development
application were not the same as those
before the meeting of the owners
corporation in February 1997. How it came about that the owners corporation
fixed its seal to the
different plans was not part of the evidence before me.
The modified plans approved by the Council, exhibit 4, show the right of
effectively the same place as on the strata
The Managing Agents
received a letter from Workcover New South Wales dated 29 August 1997 which
included the following:
"The control of lifts is governed by the Construction Safety Act of New South
Wales. Section 16 of the Act deals calls in the Construction
Safety Regulations
which states that the Australian Standard AS 1735.2 – 1993 controls the
construction and access for lifts.
A copy is attached hereto of section 12 of
the said Australian Standard.
The note below section 12.2 states:
"Access that is via an apartment or home unit is not considered as
uninterrupted access to an exit or stairway."
from Workcover to the Strata Schemes Registry dated 12 November 1998 referred to
directions issued by the authority concerning
access through lot "..." to the
lift well and motor room.
Ms C Pawl Associate
Director of Monteath & Powys Strata Management Pty Limited gave oral
evidence in the matter. As well as dealing
with some of the above matters her
evidence was that she had been involved with the scheme since registration in
1994. She was familiar
with the various plans that had been submitted to the
owners corporation by the respondent and the requirements of the right of way.
Her concerns with the obligations that were imposed by the interim orders arose
out of the fact that the modified plans were in
breach of the obligations in
respect of lift access imposed by Workcover. In particular that access to the
lift via an apartment
or unit is not considered uninterrupted as is required.
In cross examination she agreed that physically access is possible through
"..." to the lifts and that there was nothing on record to say that exhibit 3
complied with Workcover requirements.
Orders are made
accordingly.
