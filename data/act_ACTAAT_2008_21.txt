EX TEMPORE REASONS FOR DECISION
12 August 2008 Mr M H Peedom, President
This is an application for review of a decision of a delegate of the
respondent which disallowed an objection by the applicant to
a decision of the
respondent. The decision was to refuse an application made by the applicant for
a concession from the stamp duty
payable for an off the plan purchase of a
residential property.
2. Concessions are available to eligible home buyers under a Disallowable
Instrument (No. DI2005-157) entitled ‘Taxation Administration
payable – Home Buyer Concession Scheme) Determination 2005 (No. 2)’
“the Determination”
3. The Determination is made pursuant to
section 139
Administration Act 1999
. The Determination applies to:
a) ............
transfer, or if the transfer is preceded by an agreement for transfer –
that agreement – first executed or entered into
on or after the date of
effect of this instrument;
of a Crown lease.
The date of the instrument was 6 July 2005.
4. Relevantly to the issue in this case, clause 6 of the Determination
a grant, transfer or agreement for transfer made after 31 December 2004, an
application for concessional duty under the Scheme
must be received by the
Commissioner for ACT Revenue before the date the duty must be paid.
5. The date by which the duty must be paid is to be ascertained
section 16A
Duties Act 1999
which states:
, liability for duty on an ‘off the plan’
purchase agreement is taken to arise if at least 1 of the following events
(a) the agreement is completed;
.............
It then goes on to say at subsection (2):
(2) the duty payable on an ‘off the plan’ purchase
(a) is payable within 14 days after 1 of those events happens;
.............
6. The applicant entered into an agreement for the purchase of a residential
property on 10 April 2006. The transfer of the property
was effected on 6 June
7. Accordingly, to comply with clause 6 of the Determination, an application
was required to be made 14 days after one of the events
happened. One of those
events, that is, the completion of the agreement, happened on 6 June 2006.
8. The application was received by the respondent on 2 October 2007.
Accordingly, it was lodged well in excess of one year after
the expiry of the
time provided for by clause 6.
9. The applicant has explained the delay in making the application as
attributable to the failure of a solicitor who he says he instructed
to make the
application on his behalf.
10. The conduct of the solicitor in failing to make the application was
evidently the subject of a complaint to the Law Society.
The Tribunal was not
informed of the outcome of the complaint. But it is unnecessary for the
Tribunal to make any finding about
the cause of the delay in lodging the
application for concession.
11. The Determination specifies a period of time for the lodging of an
application for a concession. The provision fixing a time
limit is expressed in
mandatory terms. It is unsurprising that a time limit for seeking such a
benefit would be required to be made
within a specified time and not left
open-ended.
12. It sometimes happens that legislation or statutory instruments which fix
a time for the doing of certain things are expressed
in a way that do not make
compliance with a time limit mandatory. It is sometimes the case that where a
time limit is specified
there is expressly conferred a power to extend the time
or an inference is able to be drawn that the time limit is not mandatory.
Clause 4(c) of the Determination is an example of this. It allows the
Commissioner to extend the time to meet the residency requirement.
Clause 4(c)
is to be contrasted with clause 6.
13. There is no such express provision in the Determination nor is there
anything in it which infers that the time limit can be waived
or extended. Nor
is there anything in the legislation pursuant to which the Determination was
made which would allow an applicant
to obtain the benefit of a concession
without making an application for it in the manner prescribed.
14. Mr Fitzpatrick referred to a reference in the form of application for
the concession to the power of the Commissioner to issue
an amended assessment
as indicating that the Commissioner had a discretion to waive or extend the time
period. That power, however,
is derived from express provision in the
Administration Act
and is expressed to be exercisable in circumstances where a
concession is granted and it is subsequently determined that the application
not eligible for the concession. That is plainly not the case here.
15. Accordingly, the Tribunal, having no greater power or discretion than
that of the Commissioner, is unable to extend the time
for lodging the
application for a concession or to waive the requirement.
16. Irrespective as to the merits of the applicant’s explanation for
not complying with clause 6 of the Determination, the
Tribunal cannot approve
the application for a concession.
17. The decision under review is therefore affirmed.
