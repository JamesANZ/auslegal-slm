As Mark Janis unequivocally
The Peace of Westphalia legitimated the right of sovereigns to govern their
peoples free of outside interference, whether any such
external claim to
interfere was based on political, legal or religious principles. [...]
Sovereignty, as a concept, formed the cornerstone
of the edifice of
international relations that 1648 raised up.
Sovereignty was the crucial
element in the peace treaties of Westphalia
, the international agreements
that were intended to end a great war and to promote a coming peace. The
treaties of Westphalia enthroned
and sanctified sovereigns, gave them powers
domestically and independence externally.
In his essay marking the tercentenary of the
, Leo Gross
emphasised how much 1648 constituted a turning point in the organisation of
Europe, away from the so-called
ancien régime
. He wrote:
‘Westphalia, for better or worse,
marks the end of an epoch and the
opening of another
. It represents the majestic portal which leads from the
old into the new world.’
Anzilotti, for his part, observed that Westphalia has been ‘considered,
rightfully so, as the starting point of the
historical development of the
present international law’.1
Richard Falk opined: ‘It was not until some decades later, [after Grotius]

that ended the Thirty Years’

dominant world order
In terms of social effect on the consciousness of humanity, the
is said to have consecrated the principle of sovereign equality
of states,1
which has been at the core of
international law ever since.1
Charles Rhyne
explained it in the following terms: ‘The traditional European
international law system dates from the Treaty
of Westphalia of 1648, which
marked the formal recognition of states as sovereign and independent
political units
Likewise, Donat
Pharand wrote that ‘state sovereignty came to be
accepted as a
principle of international law
at the Peace of Westphalia, ending the Thirty
Years’ War’.1
Again, recently,
Thomas Franck noted: ‘Since the Reformation, the

assumption that

discourses on contemporary issues
on the international plane. Preliminarily, the notion of myth and mythology will
be examined because
it is at the centre of the present argument about the
‘Westphalian model’.
II MYTH AND MYTHOLOGY
Like ordinary words, myths are also powerful social productions, often
themselves expressed through language, which provide a shared
explanatory
structure for substantial areas of socially constructed reality. In the last
century and a half, myths and mythology
have been the subject of numerous
scholarly works in different disciplines,2
including not only theology and philosophy, but also psychology, anthropology,
semantics, literary criticism, sociology, and political
The term ‘mythology’ combines the Greek
which originally referred to the ideas of ‘speech’ and

‘speech’ and, with Herodotus in the 5th century BC,

presentation of the world but as simply a story which has an emotional effect on

This opposition between
as story-telling and fiction, on
the one hand, and
as rational explanation, on the other,
remains relevant today and explains that, in everyday usage, a myth is often
taken to involve

As a result, works on myth
invariably contain the

popular, pejorative sense of the term ‘myth’ as a synonym for
metaphor, falsehood
and distortion, with the scholarly and technical sense which
considers myths as valid and true within the shared consciousness of
Similarly, here, it is the
allegorical value and the semiotic significance of myths that interest the
present study.3
The truth of the matter is that mythology constitutes one of the ways that
society may explain itself to itself. Society can use aetiological
myths (that
is, origin myths) to explain its genesis to itself, thus building a
belief-system about the whens, wheres and hows of
its becoming and its

consciousness.3
Therefore, aetiological
myths like the myth of

would also create and transform reality through the human mind, within the

of society.3
It follows that the very-large-scale myth of

have a very-large-scale social effect, as the incontestably true legal basis of
the present international state system.
In examining this myth, the historical
facts and events which the linguistic sign originally represented/created before
a mythical sign will be scrutinised to show that the mythical reality
for which it now stands is substantially remote from the initial
reality. The extraordinary social power that the Westphalian myth has
demonstrated in spite of such equivocal historical
basis, especially in relation
to the idea of sovereignty and the making of international law (including the
International Criminal
Court), will also be considered.
III THE ‘WESTPHALIAN MODEL’ OF INTERNATIONAL
LEGAL ORDER
The following discussion will support the hypothesis that
is a myth through a three-part analysis. First, the social organisation and the
transcendental political entities in the Middle Ages,
as well as the dynamics at
work in Europe and the events that led to the Thirty Years’ War, will be
considered. Second, the
actual agreements reached in Westphalia will be analysed
to ascertain their main objects and material provisions, which have nothing
do with the creation of a state system. Finally, the period following 1648 will
be examined to assess whether or not, as an aftermath
universal institutions disappeared in favour of distinct separate polities.
From the Barbarian Invasions to the Thirty Years’
After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in
most territories in Europe were in a
chaotic political status because of the so-called
invasions.4
The separate communities
constituted segmented societies4
characterised by a heteronomous form of social
organisation.4
At the time, individuals had
different rights and obligations, which could overlap and conflict since the
decentralised feudal structure
was not based on a strictly linear
hierarchy.4
As Daniel Philpott put it:
‘Feudal lines of obligation resembled a system of arteries in a body, not
a pyramid with an apex’.4
Furthermore, the vassalage system,4
provided land in exchange for services, meant that subordinates could acquire
considerable resources and corresponding
The medieval ruling structure
‘was an inextricably superimposed and tangled one, in which different
juridical instances were
geographically interwoven and stratified, and plural
allegiances, asymmetrical suzerainties and anomalous enclaves
abounded’.4
It is not until the second
half of the Middle Ages, starting in the 11th century, that some monarchs began
to develop a more organised
government.4
Christendom
This period also saw most of these polities getting together in a common
Christian community, known as the
Christendom
This spiritual union
encouraged and facilitated contacts and, with the martial energy of the
Crusades, was the catalyst to a profound
social transformation of almost all
Western Europe.5
It also brought two new
powerful actors to the forefront of European

This was said
to constitute the ‘greatest attempt of all time at supranational
organisation in Europe’.5
co-existence of these two transcendental political entities, however, was never
entirely peaceful and amicable.
When the Roman Empire in the West resumed in

Great) seemed to acknowledge the Papacy’s

however, the new Holy

spiritual and temporal powers
and that the Emperor directly received the

In short, as Philip Allott Cartesianly explained, the medieval
European society [was] the scene of a structure-system struggle in two
dimensions − horizontal, between Papacy and German Empire;
between Papacy/German Empire, on the one hand, and the countless subordinate
civil societies of Europe, on the other

vis-a-vis the vassals and the people; and, (ii) without, vis-a-vis the Pope and
the Emperor.6
European chessboard
Eventually, the interaction of the different polities in both religious and
political fields, as well as the developments in organisation
and governance,
allowed monarchies to gain a leading position on the European political
chessboard. It shall become clear, however,
that this slow process began several
centuries before, and cumulated a century-and-a-half after, the

dismissal was more categorical in certain countries − Spain never formally
recognised Imperial power; France severed
its feudal ties with the Emperor after
973; and England’s vassalage vis-a-vis the Empire was terminated in the
13th century.7
However, it seems to be the consolidation of power under autonomous rulers in
England and France, as well as the emergence of free
cities in Northern
that effectively replaced the ideal
of a universal Christendom with the idea of distinct separate polities enjoying
full autonomy
over their territories.8
Emergence of independent polities
Chronologically, the Northern cities of the Italian peninsula – Genoa,
Florence, Pisa, Venice – were the pioneers in reaching
a certain system of
organisation during the 11th and 12th centuries, which fell within the general
enthusiasm of the Renaissance.8
between the Pope and the Emperor considerably helped the
establishment and survival of these relatively self-sufficient
At the beginning of the 14th
century, it was recognised that the Northern Italian cities could not be
conquered. By the 16th century,
however, their strength had comparatively
decreased because of their opponents’ enhanced military capacity and the
trade routes.8
England was the first large geographic area to reach a centralised form of
governance. Following the Great Conquest in 1066, the English
societies embarked upon the process towards

the loyalty of the people moved
from the local authorities to the monarchy.8
The aristocracy-initiated movement of protest that brought the Magna Carta in
1215 did not challenge the centralised institutions
rather, it sought some basic
guarantees of protection from the King, especially with regard to property
Although the unity of the English
royal power was later shaken by the War of the Roses, it remained largely
independent from any
higher authority.9
The French communities proceeded more slowly towards the organisation of
central ruling under the authority of a

to secular matters, increasingly substantial political concessions were
gradually granted in favour of the
principalities.10

against the Catholic

polities within the Empire.10
Conflicts of religion and politics
This temporary truce in the European religious chaos and the peaceful
coexistence it brought deteriorated over the next fifty
Especially during the reign of
Emperor Rudolf II (1576-1612) worship restrictions were progressively
reimposed.10
In fact, after the troubles
in Donauwörth,10
was invoked as the basis for the resurgence of Catholicism. By the
beginning of the 17th century, both camps had their coalitions
– the Evangelical Union (est
1608), a Protestant defensive alliance;10
and, the Catholic League (est 1609), a similar organisation for
Catholics.11
Although the majority of
Princes were not in favour of war, some were willing to take advantage of any
opportunity to increase their
land base and political power.
The rivalries of the time, however, did not stop at the German
England and the United
Provinces of the Netherlands allied with the Evangelical Union and were ready to
support its cause; in the
North, both Denmark and Sweden had ambitions to
control the strategic Baltic region; Catholic Spain was preparing to reconquer
Protestant Netherlands; and, France was opposed to the hegemonic aspirations
of the Emperor-Spanish King coalition.11
This large number of increasingly powerful actors in Europe, in addition to the
multilayered system of political authorities, as
well as the religious dimension
of the different polities, made a violent solution of the situation virtually
inevitable.
The spark that ignited the fire came from Bohemia in 1618 following the
Defenestration of
which prompted a revolt
against the Emperor and the Catholic domination. The series of wars that
followed are known as the Thirty

destructive armed conflict in Europe until the 20th

At this stage, the most important point to acknowledge about this analysis of
is that, by the 17th century, Europe was no longer dominated
by the Holy Roman Empire or the Papacy.12
The supreme authority in spiritual and temporal spheres was not exclusively held
anymore – assuming it once was– by transcendental
institutions.
Instead, distinct separate polities both within and without the Empire had
started to establish a solid foundation
based on the idea of political
autonomy.12
This already suggests that,
contrary to the general opinion, what is considered a
after 1648 did not come into existence by enchantment through
the stroke of a pen at the bottom of some peace
agreements.12
The section that follows will look at the so-called
constitutio
Westphalica
by examining the actual
treaty documents, with a view to prove that the orthodoxy according to which
1648 can be credited for the
birth of the modern state system is unsupported by
historical facts, and is hence a myth.
The Peace of Westphalia
Peace of Westphalia
, formalised on 24 October 1648, was in fact
composed of two separate agreements.12
Treaty of Osnabrück
was concluded between two groups of political
entities – on the one hand, the Protestant Queen of Sweden and her allies
on the other, the Holy Roman Habsburg Emperor and the German Princes. The
Treaty of Münster
, for its part, was also concluded between two
groups – one the one hand, the Catholic King of France and his allies and,
the other, the Emperor and the

Although the

France insisted on having the German Princes as parties to the
strategy obviously meant to weaken the position of the Emperor vis-a-vis the
Princes. In fact, the

peace between the former belligerents, but also to dealing with constitutional

Münster Treaty

and denominational matters.13
Although the

, established that a
ruler who chose to change his or her religion could not compel his or her
subjects to do the same.13
Westphalia Treaties
formally recognised freedom of
conscience for Catholics living in Protestant areas and
included protection for worship practices and religious education. Article 5,
paragraph 28, of the
Osnabrück Treaty
It has moreover been found good, that those of the Confession of

As well, such dissenters were not to be ‘excluded from the Community of

procedures at the Imperial Courts, a party could demand the religious parity of
These rights afforded to the
Lutheran Protestants (‘Confession of

extended to Calvinist Protestants (the
‘Reformed’).14
Territorial settlement
The second object of the
Peace of Westphalia
concerned territorial
settlement, which turned mainly on the
satisfaction
of Sweden and France.
Sweden’s traditional claims with respect to the south shore of the Baltic
region were given effect in
Treaty of Osnabrück
. Accordingly,
Western Pomerania, the islands of Rügen, Usedom and Wollin, the bishoprics
of Bremen and Verdun, and the port
of Wismar passed under the Swedish

which included the
bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun,15
well as the area known as Pinerolo.15
House of Austria’s rights in the region of Alsace were also conveyed to
but not without a substantial
qualification. Indeed, article 92 of the

Treaty-making power
According to the general view that considers 1648 as a break from the
ancien régime
, there is another highly material provision in the
agreements which would epitomise statehood, namely, that dealing with the
of power to conclude
treaties.16
At article 65, the
They [the German polities] shall enjoy without contradiction, the Right of
Suffrage in all Deliberations touching the Affairs of the

when the Business in hand shall be the making or interpreting of Laws, the

erecting new Fortifications in the Territories of the States, or reinforcing the
old Garisons;
as also when a Peace or alliance is to be concluded, and treated
future, without the Suffrage and Consent of the Free Assembly of all the States
of the Empire:
Above all, it shall be free perpetually to each of the States
of the Empire, to make Alliances with Strangers for their Preservation
Safety; provided, nevertheless, such Alliances be not against the Emperor, and
the Empire, nor against the Public Peace, and
this Treaty, and without prejudice

Article 8, paragraph 1, of the
Osnabrück Treaty
was to the same
The political entities making up
the Empire were thus given the power to independently make agreements between
themselves and with
foreign countries. This competence, however, was explicitly
limited by the
according to which no such alliance could be
directed against the
or be in breach of the
itself. Also significant is that, beside treaty-making, these
provisions confirmed to the Imperial Diet all other powers usually
linked with
the exercise of supreme authority over a territory – for example,
legislation, warfare, taxation.16
Moreover, it appears that these treaty articles merely recognised a practice
which had already been in existence for almost half a
century. Indeed, the
powerful German Princes were conducting their own foreign policy long before
. Palatinate and Brandenburg, for instance, struck alliances
with the United Provinces of the Netherlands in 1604 and 1605
respectively.16
Further, most rulers
within the Empire formed part of the armed force coalitions – the
Evangelical Union and the Catholic League
– that existed at the outbreak
of the Thirty Years’ War in 1618.16
In light of this, the articles concerning the treaty-making power can hardly be
viewed as groundbreaking or as compelling evidence
of a new independent status
for the German distinct separate polities.
Recapitulation
The rest of the provisions in the two documents finalised in 1648 related to
rather secondary issues.16
They included
matters such as a general amnesty going back to the Bohemian troubles, the
neutralisation of certain territories, the
restitution of property and the
renouncement of debts, the re-establishment of commerce and trade, the
hereditary succession in some
German monarchies, as well as the general
representation in Imperial institutions and the election of the Emperor.
To summarise, the principal objects and material provisions of the
Münster Treaties
do not at all support the
traditional position that the
Peace of Westphalia
constitutes a paradigm
shift whereby the political entities involved gained exclusive power over their
territories. The two main
purposes of the agreements related to the practice of
religion and the settlement of territories, not to the creation of distinct
separate polities independent from any higher authority. As regards religious
matters, the German Princes did not even retain their
existing power;
, the rule of
cuius regio eius religio
was restrained by
denominational protections for minorities and equality guarantees were provided
for Catholics and Protestants.
Furthermore, the Empire remained a key actor according to

the Empire, thus acknowledging an enduring overlordship
for the Emperor. Vis-a-vis France, although no Imperial feudal link remained
after most land transfers, some parts of Alsace maintained their autonomist
status granted by the House of Austria. Finally, it was
just seen that the power
to conclude alliances formally recognised to the German Princes was not
unqualified and that, in fact, they
had conducted such foreign affairs long
before then.
This perspective on
focussing on the relevant documents
clearly shows, therefore, that 1648 cannot legitimately be deemed a turning
point in the development
of the present state system. Rather, the outcome of the
congress constituted nothing more than a step further – even, arguably,
relatively modest one – in the gradual shift from the ideal of a universal
overlordship to the idea of distinct separate
political entities enjoying full
autonomy over their territories.16
another way, the confinement of the transcendental institutions in Europe and
the erosion of their authority over both spiritual
and temporal spheres in
favour of their constituting parts did not start, and certainly did not
culminate either, with the

control and power over their territories. This section
will refute this
postulate and will show that, in fact, Europe’s secular transcendental
institution did not disappear in favour
of its constituting parts as an
aftermath of the
urvival of Imperial institutions
In the 17th century and 18th century, the principal German political entities
within the Empire could be gathered in the following
categories: first,
Ecclesiastical Principalities (dominated by Catholic Princes); second, Secular
Principalities (dominated by Protestant
Princes); third, Imperial Cities; and,
finally, families of Imperial Counts and
Some of the Secular
Principalities – Brandenburg-Prussia, Electoral Saxony, Bavaria, the
Palatinate, Hesse, Trier, and Württemberg
– were antagonistic to the
Imperial authority and challenged the Emperor’s prerogatives. The other
Secular Principalities,
as well as Ecclesiastical Principalities, Imperial
Cities, Counts and Knights, supported the Empire and were in favour of keeping
its institutions alive and strong.17
These institutions included the Diet and the Emperor himself, as well as the
Imperial Courts, the Imperial Circles and the Imperial

hence the adage

Accordingly,
there is little doubt that, originally, the Diet was intended to be the most
important Imperial body after the Emperor.
It was seen that the
Treaty of Osnabrück
modified the composition
of the Diet by establishing guarantees for denominational
equality.17

meant that, after 1648, the
Diet could hardly fulfil its legislative
functions.18
Indeed, although it remained in permanent session starting in
very little at all was
accomplished by the Diet, mainly because of deadlocks caused by denominational
equality or by lack of unanimity.
The consequential impeded leadership and
direction given to the Empire as a whole was fertile ground for the subordinate
German polities
to claim and, indeed, exercise power over their
territories.18
But in spite of this, the
Diet continued to be a forum within the Imperial system where issues of national
concerns could at least
be voiced and
One must also realise that it
was only in the middle of the 18th century – that is, one-hundred years

Significantly,
here, this progressive erosion of the transcendental Imperial power began
several centuries before 1648.19
to the historian John Gagliardo, it can actually be traced back to the
in 1356, which first prescribed legal modalities for the election of
the Emperor.19
Since this revolutionary landmark in the constitutional annals of the Empire,
and up to the
Reichsdeputationshauptschluss
1803, just before the demise, the Emperor and the other Imperial institutions
underwent piecemeal and virtually uninterrupted
reductions in their functions
and powers. However, one must emphasise that it was as a result of
Napoleon’s conquest of Germany
that the Holy Roman Empire ceased
to exist.19

Theories of the Empire
Finally, an account of the theoretical assessment of the Imperial political
organisation given by some of the leading intellectuals
both before and after
1648 will close this look at
. Unsurprisingly, the European
academics of the time could not agree on who enjoyed ultimate power over German
territories.19
Les six Livres de la
first published in 1576,
the Frenchman Jean Bodin followed the Aristotelian categories of polities
– monarchy, aristocracy,
democracy19
– and held that the Empire was an aristocracy, not a monarchy,
the seven princes Electors, having by little and little withdrawn the
sovereignty, have left nothing unto the emperor, but the bare
marks thereof in
show; the sovereignty it self in effect remaining unto the state of the seven
electors, of three hundred German
princes or thereabouts, and the ambassadors
deputed for the imperial cities.19
With the one exception of Henning Arnisaeus, this conclusion was opposed by
German publicists – including Johannes Althusius,
Bartholomaeus
Keckermann, Hermann Kirchner, Daniel Otto, and Tobias Paurmeister – who
insisted that the Emperor was a true
Other 17th century authors avoided a strict classification of ruling orders,
which could not possibly reflect the multifarious German
political reality.
Among them, Veit Ludwig von Seckendorf and Johannes Limnaeus who, building on
the idea of compound polyarchy first
formulated by Christoph
suggested that the Emperor and
the Princes simply shared the supreme authority within the

on the issue shortly after

– instead of Aristotle’s tripartite
grouping – and held that
the German political structure was
, that is, of a hybrid nature
between monarchical and
aristocratic.20
Now, for the present purposes, the most meaningful facet of the post-1648
period of German political history is that the Holy Roman
Empire did not
dissipate in favour of its constituting parts, neither in law nor in fact, as a
result of the
Peace of Westphalia
. As one historian appositely wrote:
‘The peace [in 1648] was not the tombstone of the empire but a charter
which gave it another

legal system of independent states but,
, the German distinct

region in the 19th century.20
IV CONCLUSION
To recapitulate, the hypothesis at the heart of this paper is that the
orthodoxy according to which the
Peace of Westphalia
recognised and
applied for the first time the idea of sovereignty and hence constitutes a
paradigm shift in the development of the
present state system is historically
unfounded and, in effect, is a myth. It was argued that 1648 constitutes no more
than one instance
where distinct separate polities pursued their continuing
quest for more authority over their territory through greater autonomy.
The discussion attempted to substantiate this argument in a three-part
analysis. First were examined the segmented and heteronymously
medieval societies based on decentralised feudal structures, which later unified
through the Christendom under two transcendental
political entities – the
Pope and the Emperor. It was also seen that the dynamics at work in
Europe’s religious and political
spheres meant that, at the break of the
Thirty Years’ War, the respective universal authorities of the Pope and
the Emperor
had already been severely depleted by the joint actions of the
Reformation and the centralisation of government both within and without
Holy Roman Empire.
Second, the principal objects and material provisions of the
were shown to deal
with religious matters, territorial settlements and the transfer of
treaty-making power. The purpose of
, in fact, was not at all
contrary, it kept the
very much alive, be it in the
Empire’s institutions, through feudal territorial links, or by restricting
the Princes’
alliance privileges. Finally, it was seen that the Empire did
not disappear in favour of the German polities as an aftermath of the
. Indeed, despite reductions in the scope of their functions and
powers, the Imperial institutions remained active until they disappeared.
The study was thus concerned with the material reality originally represented
through language by the word ‘Westphalia,’
which essentially
concerned the peace congress that ended the Thirty Years’ War. Now, what
comes out of this discussion is
that the material reality that the linguistic
sign ‘Westphalia’ represented in 1648, through the human mind, does
correspond to the reality with which the ‘Westphalian state
system’ has long been associated. Indeed, it was shown that
did not turn the page on multilayered ruling in Europe, but simply
constituted a case where distinct separate polities claimed more
through enhanced independence, which was really only reach a century-and-a-half
later. This reality strongly contrasts
with the Westphalian dogma according to
which, by allegedly recognising the German Princes as sovereign, the
signalled the beginning of a new
Such a demonstration makes a compelling case that
constitutes a myth, an aetiological myth, or origin myth. Semiotically, the word
‘Westphalia,’ which represented the
reality of the twin peace
congress, metamorphosed into a myth which has represented, as well as indeed
created, a new reality, a
mythical reality, about the present international
state system. Most importantly, in the process whereby the word became a myth,
the historical facts and events surrounding the
became irrelevant
and/or incontestable. Put another way, although ‘Westphalia’ changed

be viewed in terms of

of the origin of modern international relations. For human societies, and in

By holding as unquestionably true and valid what is in fact a human-made
fabrication, the aetiological myth of
has built a
belief-system. This social production has thus provided a shared explanatory
structure for the socially constructed international
reality and, in doing so,
has had an extraordinary impact upon the shared consciousness of humanity.
Furthermore, given that this
myth managed its way into the very fabric of our
international legal order – as the model for the idea, and the ideal, of
sovereignty in international law – the social power that
has continuously demonstrated within human reality increased
considerably.
Indeed, one can imagine, for instance, that people involved in international
law who use the word ‘Westphalia’ every day
of the week – like
the publicists referred to in the
introduction20
– do not care about
the history of the
Peace of Westphalia
. They resort to the expression
‘Westphalian model’, in most cases, as a ‘convenient
shorthand’21
to explain the
fundamental juristic basis of the world organisation (or disorganisation)
founded on the principle of the sovereign
equality of states, in which is rooted
the whole scheme of international relations, as well as the rules of
international law.21
In sum, a reference
to ‘Westphalia’ will invariably bring up, through the cognitive
process of the mind, a legally-empowered
of our ‘international system

The debates on numerous other
contemporary issues on the international plane have also been voiced in relation
to the myth of ‘Westphalia’21
and the contention repeatedly heard now is that the reality this linguistic sign
represents is being challenged by ‘globalisation,’

powerful word.21

‘speech-act theory’ in
How to do Things with Words
Such a conceptualisation of words and
expressions as separate and distinct from reality, is essentially
etymologically, belonging to a name. Nominalism is a medieval
philosophy, most often associated with William of Ockham, which took
that abstract concepts are merely words and do not refer to anything that exists
in the way that particular things exist.
This idea of ‘consciousness of
humanity’ is borrowed from the moral philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich
Hegel, in particular
from G W F Hegel,
Phänomenologie des Geistes
(1952) first published in 1807, §§ 632-671; see also the translation
by A V Miller, G W F Hegel,
Phenomenology of Spirit
(1977) 383-409. The
idea of ‘consciousness’ associated to an ensemble of human beings
was suggested by G Butler, ‘Sovereignty
and the League of Nations’

This is based on Ludwig
Wittgenstein’s theory of language which, initially, was to the effect that
words could represent reality,
that language offered, as it were, a picture of
the world; see L Wittgenstein,
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
However, in his later work on the issue,
Philosophical Investigations
(1958) the Austrian philosopher
categorically revised his position and argued that words and expressions do not
merely provide a
representation of reality but, in effect, language would be an
happening within reality, that it is indeed a participant in
human consciousness − ‘Here the term
” is meant to bring into prominence the fact
of language is part of an activity, or of a form of
life;’ ibid 11. [emphasis in original] ] See also P Allott, ‘The
Nation as Mind Politic’ (1992) 24
J Int’l L & Pol
1361-1362: ‘With Wittgenstein, we have been forced to face the possibility
that human communication is not the transfer
of something called Truth through a
neutral medium called Language. Communication would then have to be regarded as
simply another
form of human activity, sharing in the intrinsic and irreducible
ambiguity of all human activity.’
The term ‘organic’ is used
here to denote a property of language that allows words and expressions to be,
simultaneously,
autonomous and intertwined with the reality they represent. This
idea is linked to the so-called ‘Ogden and Richards’
Triangle,’ whereby words are considered linguistic signs (Ogden and
Richards’ ‘symbol’) which indirectly
represent reality (Ogden
and Richards’ ‘referent’) through the cognitive process of the
human mind (Ogden and Richards’
‘thought or reference’) all of
which for the purpose of communication within the shared consciousness of
society. See

Myths may be classified according to
their topics, based on what they are about, although any such attempt is
somewhat dubious as
the categories are not mutually exclusive and the borders
between them remain vague. Generally speaking, however, one can identify
following five types of myth: (i)
aetiological
myths, concerning the
origin of things; (ii)
eschatological
myths, about the final end of
things; (iii)
soteriological
myths, pertaining to momentous saving and
salvation; (iv)
myths, combining rites with narratives; and, (v)
myths, relating to accounts of glorious deeds and accomplishments:
see M S Day,
The Many Meanings of Myth
(1984) 21-27.

beginning of things and the reason for things: see E Thomas
Lawson, ‘The
Explanation of Myth and Myth as Explanation’ (1978) 46

507. Many authors have in fact restricted mythology to origin
myths − also referred to as ‘myths of beginnings’
‘creation-myths’. The aetiological category would include: (a)
myths, pertaining to the origin of gods; (b)
myths, concerning the origin of the world; and, (c)
anthropogonic
relating to the origin of human kind.

(1996) 6. See also Vernant, above, n 31, 186, who
wrote: ‘The concept of myth we have inherited from the Greeks belongs, by
reason of its origins and history, to a tradition of thought peculiar to Western
civilisation in which myth is defined in terms of
what is not myth, being
opposed first to reality (myth is fiction) and, secondly, to what is rational
(myth is absurd).’
For instance, see E Leach,
Lévi-Strauss
(1970) 54, who explained that, ‘the special
quality of myth is not that it is false but that it is divinely true for those
who believe, but fairy-tale for those who do not’. See also, A Dundes,

(1946) 45, who makes the point as follows: ‘Myth is not only far
remote from this empirical reality; it is, in a sense, in
flagrant contradiction
to it. It seems to build up an entirely fantastic world. Nevertheless even myth
has a certain “objective”
aspect and a definite objective function.
Linguistic symbolism leads to an objectification of sense-impressions;
mythical symbolism leads to an objectification of feelings
See Flood, above n 34, 35, who wrote:
‘Myths offer charters, warrants, validations, legitimations, and
authoritative precedents
for beliefs, attitudes, and practices in any important
domain of social existence’.
See Malinowski, above n 28, 23:
‘Myth fulfills in primitive culture an indispensable function: it
expresses, enhances, and
codifies belief; it safeguards and enforces morality;
it vouches for the efficiency of ritual and contains practical rules for the
guidance of man. Myth is thus a vital ingredient of human civilization;
not an idle tale, but a hard-worked active force
; it is not an intellectual
explanation or an artistic imagery, but a pragmatic charter of primitive faith
and moral wisdom.’
[emphasis added].
See Doty, above n 33, 44, who wrote:
‘Since Malinowski’s time, we operate with a broader perspective:
essentially we
may differentiate between models
society, setting out
in a Durkheimian sense a particular mirror image of the culture, and models
society, as when the model makes visible the ideal standards to which
a society aspires.’ [emphasis in original] See also C

cities of Northern

In fact, the Pope, who crowned
Charlemagne, traded his support for the re-establishment of the Roman Empire in
exchange for the recognition
of the Church’s authority.

Louis the Pious, died in 840 and with him the Carolingian Empire. After some
years of unrest,

divided the Empire into three parts

On the struggles between the Pope and
the Emperor, see J Bryce,
The Holy Roman Empire
(4th ed, 1873)
This contention was first forcefully
propounded in the 11th century by Pope Gregory VII against Emperor Henry IV, who
was even excommunicated.
On Gregory VII’s ambitions of supremacy over both
spiritual and temporal spheres, see C H McIlwain,
The Growth of Political
Thought in the West − From the Greeks to the End of the Middle Ages
(1932) 217-221.
The Pope’s claim of supremacy
over secular matters was founded on various texts of the Holy Bible, New
Testament, most notably
Book of Matthew
, 16:19, which quotes Jesus
Christ saying: ‘I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven;
whatever you bind on earth will
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on
earth will be loosed in heaven’. This statement is repeated at
, 18:18. See also, generally, W Ullmann,
Principles of
Government and Politics in the Middle Ages
(2nd ed, 1966) 32
Wilks, above n 49, 171-174.
The Papal authority was legally based
on the so-called
dictatus papae
, that is, official juridical statements
of the Pope. Theoretically, he enjoyed full universal legislative and judicial
power, including
to adjudicate disputes between rulers, to repudiate royal
statutes or customs contrary to divine law, and even to depose monarchs
of mortal sins. See Ullmann, ibid 87
That is, community of communities.
For instance, the following
“Declaration of Imperial Independence” was made by Emperor Ludwig IV
in 1338: ‘Therefore,
[...] with the counsel and assent of the Electors and
other princes of the Empire, We declare that the imperial dignity and power
derived immediately from God alone; and that, by the law and ancient approved
custom of the Empire, when anyone is elected Emperor
or king by the imperial
electors, unanimously or by majority, at once by the mere fact of election he is
to be considered and entitled
very King and Emperor of the Romans; [...] nor
does he need the approbation, confirmation, authority or consent of the Pope or
Apostolic Sea or of any other person’; see R G D Laffan (ed),

Before the Council of Constance, which

legitimate representant
of the Papacy. See K C Cole, ‘The Theory of the
State as a Sovereign Juristic Person’ in W J Stankiewicz (ed),

Certainly the most notorious case of
monarchial Protestant disengagement from the authority of the Papacy was that of
VIII of England who used the Pope’s refusal to grant an
annulment for his marriage to Catherine of Aragon as a political justification
to elevate himself to Supreme Head of the Church of England, thus acquiring
spiritual authority in addition to political power −

Great Interregnum
a period of roughly 20 years when, for all practical purposes, the throne of the
Holy Roman Empire was vacant. Following
the death of Emperor Frederick II,
German princes took advantage of the weak Hohenstaufen dynasty and elected a
series of what proved
to be ineffectual Imperial rulers. This era ended in 1273,
when Count Rudolph of Habsburg was elected Emperor following pressure
Gregory X, who was seeking imperial support for a new crusade.
See Pennington, above n 54, 432-433;
Walker, above, n 51, 90, who wrote: ‘The Empire and the Pontiff had alike
failed to fulfil
their mission. The Emperor at no time fully responded to his
call. Endowed with an unique style, held the natural protector and leader
Christendom, Divine Viceregent in things temporal, the rightful source of the
royal title, the convoker, at least concurrently

councils, he failed to constitute himself international arbiter and

revolutions.’
Indeed, several provisions of the Magna
Carta (for instance, articles 9, 27, and 52) had nothing to do with fundamental
civil liberties, but related directly or indirectly to property rights
that the barons wanted to shield from the monarch’s
arbitrary power. See

conflicts are usually divided by historians into four phases, customarily styled
and dated as follows:
the Palatine-Bohemian period (1618-1623), ended by the
Battle of White Mountain with a Catholic victory; the Danish period (1624-1629),
another Catholic triumph consecrated by the

At the conclusion of the conflict

boundaries of the
Netherlands in a peace treaty signed on 30 January 1648, also

The legislative history of these
provisions shows that the parties originally meant to go much farther in favour
of the Princes than
what was provided for in the final version of the
Münster Treaty
. The proposition suggested by the French delegation
on 11 June 1645 was unqualified and even referred to the idea of sovereignty.
Indeed, article 8 of the said proposition, which was ultimately rejected, read:
‘Que tous lesdits Princes & Etats en général
particulier seront maintenus dans tous les autres droits de
Souveraineté
qui leur appartiennent, & spécialement
dans celui de faire des confédérations tant entre eux
les Princes voisins, pour leur conservation &
sureté;’ [emphasis added] [spelling modernised] see G H Bougeant,

short of recognising any sovereign rights to
the German Princes.
See Parker, above n 114, 2, who
noted that, along with England and France, Palatinate and Brandenburg struck
treaties of friendship
with the Netherlands, which helped the latter’s
effort against Spain.

Holsti, above n 7, 36.
See Walker, above n 51, 148, who,
speaking of the hybrid political status of the Empire and its constituting parts
in 1648, noted:
‘The territorial state had long existed in point of fact,
but, whilst each royal, ducal, or republican ruler of provinces had
recognise in his frontiers the precise limits of his jurisdiction, the sense of
national independence had been held down
in pupilage [sic] by the awe-inspiring
shadow of a majestic common superior’. See also, to the same effect,
Wight, above n
69, 152: ‘At Westphalia the states-system does not come
into existence: it comes of age’; and, Westlake, above n 6, 55:
‘When the plenipotentiaries at Munster and Osnabruck signed the Peace of
Westphalia in 1648 the ground had been well prepared
for an international
society, such a society had indeed been gradually emerging.’
One may recall that Voltaire
notoriously quipped that the German Empire was ‘neither Holy, nor Roman,
nor an Empire’;
see L C Buchheit,
Secession – The Legitimacy of
Self-Determination
(1978) 8. Pufendorf’s view on the Empire was that
of ‘an irregular state-body, much like a monster’; see J G
Reich and Nation – The Holy Roman Empire as Idea and
Reality, 1763-1806
(1980) 41; it must be stressed, however, that the terms
‘monstrosity’ (in Latin
‘irregularity’ were almost synonyms in the writings of the 17th
century and 18th century – see below
n 205. These quotes bear
witness to how important, yet immensely difficult, it has been to describe and
ascertain the nature of the
Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. The
objective of this brief review of the Imperial institutions is much more modest
to show that the Empire, whatever it was, did not end following

and a half following the Peace of Westphalia’; see, ibid
Treaty of Osnabrück
at article 8, assigned to the Diet an almost indefinite programme of work; see
Treaty Series
, 241-243. See also Pagès, above n 114, 246.
The Diet was formed of three
councils – the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the
Council of Cities. A majority
vote in two of the three bodies was needed to
submit a proposal to the Emperor, on which he had the final say.
That is, Imperial law breaks
territorial law.
See above n 143-144 and accompanying
Treaty Series
, 235. [emphasis
in original [spelling modernised]
That is, body of Protestants.
That is, body of Catholics.
This distinction based on
denomination existed in addition to the division of the Diet into three
councils. It meant that the voting
on religious matters was done in a plenary
assembly of all representatives, who sided in their respective Catholic and
groups. See Gagliardo, above n 169, 24.

Constitution

Historical J
979-980, who wrote: ‘The Protestants realized immediately that they could
exploit the right of separating into two different
religious congregations for
their own ends. By claiming that most of the disputed matters were matters of
religious controversy,
and thus enforcing the
itio in partes
, they were
able to assert that the decision reached in the particular Protestant corpus was
the only binding agreement for them,
and that the Catholics had no right to
intervene or challenge these discussions. This tactical manoeuvring impeded the
Diet seriously,
while the Emperor attempted to stress the unity of the
Since the Diet was convoked by the
Emperor and fearing that the latter could disregard its constitutional role by
not calling sessions,
the representatives refused to disband the Diet after
1663. Therefore, it remained in permanent session until the end of the Empire
1806, hence the nickname ‘Eternal Diet’ of Regensburg. See
Gagliardo, above n 169, 21.
See Sacchi, above n 167, 482, who
wrote: ‘L’unanimité sur les problèmes constitutionnels
ou religieux importants
étant en réalité impossible
à atteindre, cette institution, qui siégea jusqu’au milieu
XIXème siècle, devint le point où
s’accumulèrent tous les dossiers essentiels de l’empire,
paralysa en fait toute réforme.’
It is through the Diet that the
notorious mystical formula
Kaiser und Reich
emerged to signify both the
unity and the division within the Holy Roman Empire. According to Gagliardo,
above n 169, 21, this expression
was ‘intended to convey the sense of a
kind of coequal responsibility of head and members for the preservation of
a single body, a higher unity within diversity’. The English
language cannot properly convey the precise adjectival distinction
, which would be translated at best as
‘Emperor’ and ‘Empire’.

Imperial Circles, the Imperial Courts and the Imperial Army, see Gagliardo,

Bryce, above n 59, 359
It is important to point out that
the Empire was
not abolished
by Napoleon but, rather, that its
dissolution was the result of Emperor Francis II’s renouncement to the
Roman-German crown
on 6 August 1806, following a note announcing that France no
longer recognised the
which, in fact, amounted to an ultimatum
for abdication; from then on, the authority of the Habsburg Emperor was limited
to the Austrian
borders – see Gagliardo, ibid
279-281; Bryce, ibid
365-366. Therefore, it appears to be erroneous to refer to the Napoleonic
of the Holy Roman Empire, as some commentators have –
see, for example, Krasner, above n 19, 251, who wrote: ‘Napoleon
the empire completely in 1806’.
See P Guggenheim, ‘La
souveraineté dans l’histoire du droit des gens – De Vitoria

It is important to note that, in
17th century and 18th century writings, the term ‘monstrosity’

Empire but, rather, to mean a striking and unusual irregularity in a political
body. See Schröder, above n 181, 966-967.

easy to mistake the onset of another phase

Only when due allowance is
made for the first can it be seen that a new European states’ system
emerged in the eighteenth century,
and not at an earlier date
. Only when
careful regard is paid to the second can it be seen that, for all the twists and
phases it has recently undergone, the
system which then emerged or finally

in the face of genocide in Rwanda – it also
demonstrated its capacity to
adjust to changing circumstances. Indeed, in 1999 its secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, enunciated a new
doctrine that would have shocked most of his
predecessors. Atrocities on a grand scale and the denial of democratic
fundamentals
