The applicant is unrepresented
This is an ex parte application for leave to issue or file an application for a
constitutional or other writ against the
Commonwealth of Australia.
28 July 2025, Steward J directed that, pursuant to r 6.07.2 of the
Court Rules 2004
(Cth), the application for a constitutional or other
writ was not to be issued or filed without the leave of a Justice first had
obtained by the applicant. This application for leave to issue or file
the application is supported by an affidavit affirmed
by the applicant on 29
July 2025. I have read the applicant's affidavit as well as the proposed
application for a constitutional
or other writ.
proposed application for a constitutional or other writ against
the Commonwealth of Australia states that since 7 October 2023,
scenes in the Middle East have been broadcast to the world, and, though
violence is being perpetrated by "both sides", it
is apparent that one side has
done disproportionate damage and harm to the other. The application refers to
"numerous protests, rallies
and public disruptions in reaction to this
particular international conflict" and states that strong emotional reactions
community and the Australian Government's response have motivated
this "application to order the Commonwealth to fulfill its duty
alleged complicity in the Palestine‑Israel international conflict".
The balance of the application then states that
a writ of mandamus should issue
because the requisite elements are satisfied: there is a Commonwealth officer, a
public duty and
an unfulfilled performance, namely that the "subjects of
the Commonwealth must comply with the criminal law", specifically Pt 5.3
Criminal Code Act 1995
relief that the applicant seeks in the proposed application for
a constitutional or other writ is, relevantly:
Commonwealth of Australia is to comply with the
Criminal Code Act 1995
(Cth) in response to the international conflict between the State of Israel,
Palestinian territories and other Middle‑Eastern
countries as of 2025.
Governor-General and AFP Minister are to specify all

paragraph (b) of the definition of

in Part 5.3 of the
Criminal Code Act 1995
Governor-General and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade are to make
regulations sanctioning all

Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011
(Cth) to specifically

b) s 103.1 of [the]
Criminal Code Act 1995
(Cth) by ensuring subjects of
the Commonwealth do not finance

an application for a constitutional or other writ must
be refused. Neither
the application for a constitutional or other writ against the Commonwealth
of Australia, nor the applicant's
supporting affidavit, discloses any rational
legal argument that could support the relief sought. The claims set out in the
application are manifestly hopeless. Moreover, the proposed defendant,
the Commonwealth of Australia, is inconsistent with paragraphs
of the relief sought, which identify a number of individuals in different
capacities. The applicant seeks to invoke this
Court's jurisdiction on a
basis that is "confused or manifestly
untenable",
and it would be
an abuse of process if the proposed application was filed.
