Snapshot 275: Sentencing Trends for Culpable Driving Causing Death in the
Higher Courts of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
culpable driving causing death in the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria (the
higher courts) from 2017-18 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on culpable driving causing death and other offences is
available on
Advisory Council Statistics (SACStat)
This offence covers homicides caused by the culpable driving of a motor
vehicle. This offence is committed when a person drives a
motor vehicle
negligently, recklessly or while under the influence of drugs or alcohol and
causes the death of another person. Culpable
driving causing death is an
indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 2,400 penalty
Culpable driving causing death is a category 2 offence if it was committed on
or after 28 October 2018.
must impose a custodial sentence for category 2 offences except in particular
circumstances. Culpable driving causing death
is also a standard sentence
offence if it was committed on or after 1 February 2018. This means that courts
must take into account
that a prison sentence of 8 years represents the middle
of the range of objective seriousness for this
This Snapshot focuses on cases where culpable driving causing death was the
principal offence, that is, cases where culpable driving
causing death was the
offence that received the most severe
Culpable driving causing death was the principal offence in 2.1% of cases
sentenced in the higher courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 73 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of culpable driving causing death.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
culpable driving causing death by financial year. There
were 13 people sentenced
for this offence in 2021-22, down from 15 in the previous year. The number of
people sentenced was highest
in 2018-19 (19 people) and lowest in 2019-20 (12
people). There were 41 people whose offending attracted standard sentence
classification.

Figure 3 shows the lengths of imprisonment for the 71 people who received a
non-aggregate prison term. Imprisonment terms ranged from
3 years to 10 years,
while the median length of imprisonment was 8 years (meaning that half of the
imprisonment terms were below
8 years and half were above).
The most common range of imprisonment term lengths was 8 to less than 9 years
(21 people).

Figure 4 shows that the average length of imprisonment imposed for culpable
driving causing death increased from 7 years and 2 months
in 2017-18 to 7 years
and 10 months in 2021-22. Over the five years, the average length of
imprisonment for culpable driving causing
death was 7 years and 7 months.

non-standard sentence offences must have regard to sentences imposed when the
offence both was and was not a standard

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an immediate
imprisonment term of less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole
period. For terms
between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the
discretion to fix a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2 years
more, the court must impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the
court fixes a non-parole period, the person must
serve that period before
becoming eligible for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the
person must serve the entirety
of their imprisonment term in custody.
All 72 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for culpable driving causing
death were eligible for a non-parole period, and all
were given a non-parole
Figure 6 shows the lengths of those non-parole periods. Non-parole periods
ranged from 1 year to 14 years and 6 months, while the
median non-parole period
was 5 years (meaning that half of the non-parole periods were below 5 years and
half were above).
The most common ranges of non-parole periods were 4 to less than 5 years and
5 to less than 6 years (15 people each).
