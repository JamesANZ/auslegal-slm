Department of Housing v Cao
[2002] NSWRT 20
(30 January
File No. 01/61100
RESIDENTIAL TRIBUNAL
: NSW Department of
Housing (Landlord)
: Cao (Tenant)
APPEARANCES
Julie Conway appeared on behalf of the Department of Housing; there was no
appearance by or on behalf of Mr Cao.
: 5 December 2001
On 5 December 2001 the following order was made:
The application is dismissed
because the application for termination was lodged outside 30 days:
REASONS FOR DECISION
APPLICATION
The application seeking termination of the
tenancy and possession of the premises was lodged in the Tribunal on 9 November
The application stated that the reasons for seeking the orders were:
"Tenant gave landlord a Notice of termination ending the tenancy on
31/8/01. Vacant Possession of the premises has not been given
REPRESENTATION
Ms Conway appeared for the
landlord/applicant and produced the landlord’s written authority to her
dated 17 February 1999.
Mr Cao did not appear and was not
represented.
The parties entered into a
residential tenancy agreement dated 13 January 1995 in respect of the premises
at ... Bankstown. The term
of the tenancy agreement was weekly commencing on 16
January 1995. The rent was subsidised and at the time of the hearing was $39.35
per week. No rental bond was payable by the tenant. It is not in dispute that
the premises are "residential premises" within the
meaning of the
Residential
Tenancies Act
PROCEEDINGS
December 2001 the Tribunal proceeded to hear the application ex parte with
evidence being given by Ms Conway under oath. The
tenant’s written
application received at the tribunal on 4 December 2001 requesting an
adjournment of the hearing was refused
as it did not state why the tenant could
not attend on 5 December 2001. The tribunal did not consider it a sufficient
adjourn the hearing that the tenant was going overseas and that he
needed more time for a legal representative to prepare the case.
There was no
evidence that the tenant was overseas on 5 December
APPLICANT’S CASE
Ms Conway produced the
following documents to the tribunal - her authority to appear for the
Department; a copy of the tenancy agreement;
a copy of a print-out of the
tenant’s current rental ledger; a hand written note on Department of
Housing letterhead, date
stamped as received by the Department on 13 July 2001,
from Mr Cao stating in respect of ... Bankstown that "I’ll return
above property on 18/8/01 I will be vacating above property..."; another
handwritten note from the tenant date stamped received
by the Department on 16
July 2001 stating, " Dear Alison, I’m writing to inform you that my
property at ...Bankstown NSW 2200
will be vacated on 31/08/01. Any inspection
can be made between 20/08/01 to 31/08/01, I’ll contact the department to
for a suitable time." An end of tenancy condition report signed by the
tenant and on behalf of the Department dated 19 October 2001;
a letter from the
Department to Mr Cao confirming he would be leaving the premises on 31 August
2001; a note by Ms Chan of an interview
with Mr Cao on 31 August 2000; memoranda
of the Department recording contact with the tenant about vacating dated 4
September 2001
and 15 October 2001 and recording contact with Mrs Morris on 18
October 2001; a statement from Mrs Morris dated 30 November 2001
report dated 19 October 2001 following the end of tenancy inspection in relation
to Mr Cao’s non-occupancy of the
Ms Conway told the
tribunal the Department seeks termination of the agreement and possession of the
premises and relies on the tenant’s
notices of termination received by the
Department on 13 July and 16 July 2001 and
earlier notice the tenant said he would vacate on 18 August 2001 and in the
later notice said he would vacate on 31 August
2001. After those dates had
passed, on 15 October Mr Cao rang the Department and said he would most likely
be leaving before Christmas
although he was not sure and would give 21
days’ notice. As at the date of hearing the tenant had still not vacated
the premises
and the Department had received no keys from him. He does not owe
rent but the Department considers he has breached the lease by
subletting the
premises and not occupying the premises himself. Further Ms Conway stated that
the landlord relies on the outgoing
inspection report that the tenant signed on
19 October 2001; it was also evident at that inspection that the tenant had no
possessions
at the premises and was not living there. Ms Conway also relies on
the statement from Mrs Morris in relation to the tenant’s
subletting of
the premises and the file report dated 19 October which reports on the fact that
there were few household items in
the premises. Ms Conway confirmed that the
Department did not issue the tenant with a notice of
termination.
FINDINGS AND APPLICATION OF THE LAW
clear under
that a tenant can issue a notice of
termination to a landlord to end a tenancy, on a day not earlier than 21 days
after the day on
which the notice is given, without specifying any ground
provided that it is not during the currency of a fixed term. Under
that notice must be in writing, be signed by the tenant, must identify the
residential premises and specify the day that possession
will be returned to the
landlord. Mr Cao’s notices to the Department appear to satisfy these
requirements. It also seems clear
under subsection 64(1) of the
landlord can rely on a tenant’s notice of termination to make application
to the tribunal to end a tenancy. In the
tribunal’s view however this
application to the tribunal must be made not later than 30 days after the day
specified in the
notice for possession -see subsection 64(1). Mr Cao specified
the 31 August 2001 and 18 August 2001 and the application was made
department on 9 November 2001 which is some time after 30 days after either of
those dates. Ms Conway gave evidence that
the Department relied on the fact
that the tenant said he would go on 31 August and then telephoned and said he
needed more time
and so did not put on its application until 9 November. It did
not issue its own notice to the tenant because it was relying on
tenant’s notices that he wanted to end the tenancy and the fact that he
arranged and attended an outgoing inspection on
19 October 2001. The tribunal
considered whether it should extend time for the purposes of subsection 64(1) of
but decided that in the circumstances of this case it was not
appropriate to do so.
Hence as the Department has put on its
application too late having regard to the requirements of subsection 64(1) of
in the Tribunal’s view it does not have jurisdiction to make
orders for termination and possession under
section 64.
Accordingly, the
application for termination and possession is
