This statistical report presents data on sentencing practices in Victoria in
the decade to 30 June 2023. The data includes the number
and gender of people
sentenced each year, the types of offences people were sentenced for, the types
of sentences people received,
and the imprisonment or detention lengths and fine
amounts imposed in the Supreme Court, County Court, Magistrates’ Court and
Children’s Court.
Key events influencing sentencing practices in Victoria
Sentencing in Victoria is
governed by a combination of legislation and common
The following are some of the
important changes to sentencing legislation and common law in the decade to June
2023. These are likely
to have contributed to some of the changes in sentencing
practices in Victoria during the 10-year period:
suspended prison sentences are no longer available for offences
committed on or after 1
the Court of Appeal delivers a guideline judgment in
in relation to community correction orders
the High Court says that current sentencing practices should be
just one factor to take into account in sentencing, not a controlling
some offences are classified as category 1 and category 2
offences, making a prison sentence presumptive or
the Children’s Court Youth Diversion Service is rolled out
across Victoria
some offences are classified as standard sentence offences,
requiring courts to consider a numerical sentence that represents the
the range of objective seriousness for the
the maximum term of a youth justice centre order is increased
from 3 years to 4 years
COVID-19 significantly affects court operations,
resulting in fewer cases being sentenced, more serious cases being prioritised,
sentencing discounts being given to reflect the harsher conditions of
prison, and enhanced guilty plea discounts being given to reflect
the value of
guilty pleas in clearing court
Terminology in this report
Principal offence:
principal offence
is the most serious offence in a case. Offence
seriousness is measured by the offence that received the most severe sentence
or, alternatively,
according to the National Offence
Principal offence type:
principal offence types are categories of
offences according to the offence types in the Australian Bureau of
Statistics’ standard
offence classification. For example, if a principal
offence is murder, the
principal offence type
is a homicide offence
(ANZSOC 1).
Principal sentence type:
principal sentence type
most severe sentence type in a case, according to the sentencing hierarchy in
sections 5(4)
–(7) of the
Sentencing Act 1991
(Vic). If a court
imposes one type of sentence – for example, imprisonment – in the
case, that sentence is the principal
sentence. In most instances, if a court
imposes more than one type of sentence in the same case – for example,
both imprisonment
and a fine – the
principal sentence
imprisonment. The one exception is combined orders of imprisonment with a CCO,
which in this report are represented separately
from imprisonment only, due to
their increasing prevalence.
Total effective sentence:
the total effective sentence is the sentence
imposed for all charges in a case and applies at a
level. Where a
case involves multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the
same as or longer than the principal
Supreme Court
In the 10 years to June
2023, there were 730 cases sentenced in the Supreme Court (Figure 1). The
offender was male in 642 of those
cases (87.9%), the offender was female in 83
cases (11.4%), and the offender was a company in 5 cases (0.7%).

A homicide offence was the most common principal offence type sentenced in

Reading the data
Counting rules
report presents data on the number of cases sentenced in the Victorian courts.
For case data, the counting rule for principal
proven offences counts just one
charge per case: the offence that received the most severe sentence within a
case (or the most serious
offence according to the Australian Bureau of
Statistics’ National Offence Index if multiple offences received an
equally severe
sentence). This counting rule is useful for understanding the
number of people sentenced and for understanding how their most serious
is usually sentenced. Our SACStat database includes the prevalence of different
offences at a charge level (i.e. SACStat
includes all principal and
non-principal offences).
This report excludes custodial or non-custodial supervision orders for people
who have been found not guilty because of mental impairment
or found guilty at a
special hearing, and it excludes unconditional release orders under
Crimes (Mental Impairment and Unfitness to Be Tried) Act
Although not classified as a ‘sentence’, diversion plans have
been included in this report due to the critical role they
play as an outcome
for people who become involved in the criminal justice system.
A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker
shows key points in the distribution of a series of numbers,
the median,
represented by the horizontal line within each box. Half of all values in that
distribution are above the median, and
half are below
percentile, represented by the bottom line of the box. This is the value that
25% of the values in the distribution fall
percentile, represented by the top line of the box. This is the value that 75%
of the values in the distribution fall below.
Apart from some
values, which are statistical
the full range of the
data (from the smallest to the largest value) is represented by the tips of the
vertical lines (‘whiskers’)
extending from the box.
Fine amounts
In this report, fine data is presented in dollar
amounts. Maximum fines for offences are, however, set by reference to a
number of penalty units. Penalty units in Victoria are indexed
annually by the Victorian Treasurer, increasing from $100 in 2003–04
$197.59 in 2024–25.
