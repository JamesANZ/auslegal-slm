B O'SULLIVAN instructed by Gordon Garling Moffitt
RESPONDENT:
Mr G MADDOCKS instructed by Lander &
1. Tony Graham Bargwanna claims lump sum compensation for severe bodily
disfigurement and payment of medical expenses pursuant to
s 60. His claim is
based on an injury received in the Cessnock Hotel on 15 March 1998.
2. Mr Maddocks of counsel informed the court that the issues for
determination were: whether the bodily disfigurement is
so, what the qualification of any loss should be.
3. The claim is for a 30 per cent severe bodily disfigurement. This would
attract an award for pain and suffering, though Mr O'Sullivan,
submissions, suggested that the bodily disfigurement might be found to be 20 per
4. Bargwanna is 33 years of age. In 1998 he was the licensee manager of the
Cessnock Hotel. At closing time on 15 March, he discovered
an unwelcome patron
in the hotel whom, when he threw a punch, Bargwanna grabbed in a headlock and
fell to the floor. In this melee,
the intruder bit off his right nipple and dug
his teeth in an area above the nipple. He said that the attacker’s mouth
to be prised open with a pool cue.
5. The applicant worked on for a short period but soon ceased work at the
hotel, and was unemployed for six months. Bargwanna described
the pain as
intense - and I have no doubt that this was the truth. He said that he had had
his nipple sutured and that for some
weeks he had felt phantom sensations,
though now, he said, there is no pain and sensation has been lost in that area.
6. Exhibit E is a series of photographs which were exposed at the hospital,
some short time after the incident.
7. The applicant claims that he is very embarrassed by the loss of the right
nipple. He said that the incident was on the national
news; that he is now
conscious of the loss both on the beach and with his wife.
8. I am assisted with a series of medical reports: the Hunter Area Hospital
Health Service (Exhibit A); a report from Dr Jenkins
(Exhibit B); reports from
Dr Mulholland (Exhibit C) which deal with the psychological trauma to which the
applicant was subjected
and which, inter alia, record the fact that the worker
developed some panic disorder after this incident.
9. The only assessment is that of Dr Haertsch, who has assessed a 2 per cent
permanent severe bodily disfigurement, though Mr O'Sullivan
submitted that in
this case the assessment is not a medical issue so much as one of aesthetics.
10. I viewed the chest in chambers. It was clear he has lost the top of his
right nipple. The remaining nipple on the left side
is small (like a tiny
button) and the surrounding area, save for the loss equivalent to the top of a
pin, is normally coloured.
As far as I can see, the loss has to be described as
minor or slight, and would not cross the threshold of severe bodily
disfigurement.
11. I find that the applicant suffered an injury on 15 March 1998, but that
the loss does not constitute a severe bodily disfigurement.
12. I make an award in favour of the applicant pursuant to s 60.
13. I order there be no applicant's costs after 15 May 2003 in accordance
with s 115 on the basis that a reasonable offer was refused.
