REASONS FOR DECISION
the purposes of considering the Complainant’s application, the Tribunal is
constituted by the same Members as the Tribunal
which made the decision in
HCCC v Phung (No.1) [2012] 1 NSWDT
dated 18 May 2012 (“Decision No.
Complainant seeks the imposition of an Interim Order on the Respondent’s
registration pursuant to Section 167E of the
Health Practitioner Regulation
National Law (NSW)
(“the National Law”); the Tribunal having
made findings of
unsatisfactory professional conduct
professional
on 18 May 2012 following its inquiry into the complaints and
particulars thereof, on 14 and 15 May 2012. Reasons for the Tribunal’s
decision were handed down on 10 July 2012: Decision No. 1;
Tribunal’s decision No. 1 completed the first stage of its Inquiry with
the hearing as to any consequential, protective
Orders, to be considered at the
second stage of the Inquiry, upon the Complainant’s application, supported
by the Respondent,
for reasons conveyed to the Tribunal at the commencement of
the Inquiry (C/F Decision No. 1 at [3], [4];
second stage of the Inquiry commenced on 25 July 2012 but it could not proceed
further due to illness of the Respondent’s
Counsel; accordingly it was
adjourned to 26 July but again, due to Counsel’s illness, had to be
adjourned with a new date to
be determined at a Directions
a Directions Hearing on 1 August 2012, the Tribunal’s Inquiry was fixed to
resume on 26 September 2012. During this Directions
Hearing the Complainant made
a formal application for an Interim Order on the Respondent’s
registration, relevant to Decision
No. 1. The Parties agreed that a formal
hearing of the Application was not necessary. Accordingly, Directions were made
, for the Complainant’s submissions in support of its
application, to be filed in the Registry and served on the Respondent,
August 2012; and any submissions by the Respondent to be filed in the Registry
and served on the Complainant, by 8 August 2012.
Submissions were received from
the Complainant dated 6 August 2012; and from the Respondent dated 9 August
its submissions, the Complainant notes that it sought the Respondent’s
consent to the Interim Order by letter dated 26 July,
2012 to his lawyers who
responded by letter date 30 July 2012, that the Respondent did not consent to
the imposition of the Interim
Complainant submits that an Order in the following terms, is the minimum
protection necessary for the health and safety of the
public in the period
between the imposition of the Interim Order and the Tribunal’s
determination of final protective orders:
With effect from the
date of this order, the Respondent is to advise all patients, including all
new patients and all patients
returning for treatment, prior to any treatment
commencing, that he has been the subject of a finding of professional
and that a final determination of the Tribunal concerning his
registration is pending.
In this regard the Respondent is to make a copy of the Reasons for
Decision document
HCCC v Phung (No. 1) [2012] 1 NSWDT
available to his
patients. A written acknowledgment from each patient is to be signed and dated
at the time of the disclosure.
The acknowledgment is to attest that the
patient has been so advised and had the documents made available to them and
be placed on the patient’s file held by the Respondent. Only
one written acknowledgment is required for each new or returning
Complainant’s submissions in effect, relied essentially on each of the
Tribunal’s findings made in Decision No. 1
and including the
Tribunal’s description of the Respondent’s failures as of an
“...extremely serious nature, extent
and range...” (C/F
Complainant’ submissions at [4]; Decision No. 1 at [70]. The Complainant
relies on Section 167E (2)
of the National Law which provides that
A tribunal may, during any proceedings, exercise any power or
combination of powers conferred on the Tribunal by Section 149A, except
power to caution or reprimand.”
Complainant also cited in its submission, a recent amendment to the National Law
effective 21 June 2012, which now provides in
Section 3A “...
exercise of functions under a NSW provision, the protection of the health and
safety of the public must be the paramount
consideration.
from its reliance on the above elements, the Complainant also relies on
“the fact” that the Respondent ”...
is currently practising in
solo practice without any conditions on his registration.” (Submissions at
[9]); and relies also,
on the delay rendered necessary due to Counsel’s
illness referred to above; and the necessity to ascertain a date for the
of the Tribunal’s Inquiry, acceptable to the Tribunal and to
the parties;
Respondent does not dispute the Complainant’s reliance on Section 167E of
the National Law but submits that given the discretion
available to the
Tribunal, it should not impose the Interim Order on the
Respondent;
Respondent highlights in its submissions (at [3]) what it describes, as the
Complainant’s ignoring “...the important
element...[that]...the Tribunal’s findings...[in Decision No.1]...relate
only to...conduct of the practitioner in
2002 and the first half of 2003, i.e.
9-10 years ago.”
its submissions, the Respondent referred to and relies on, the (then) NSW Dental
Board’s finding of
unsatisfactory professional conduct
in February
2008 with respect to deficiencies in the Respondent’s practice
“...essentially the same...” as those
included in Decision No. 1;
the Dental Board’s findings leading to the imposition of conditions
“...essentially that...[the
Respondent]...was not to undertake Crown and
Bridgework or Endodontic treatment until the Board...[was]...satisfied that he
had completed
necessary retraining.” (Submissions at [7]). The Tribunal
notes that the Dental Board actually required “continuing education”
of the Respondent in those two particular treatment modalities described above.
The Respondent further submitted that he had complied
with such conditions in
2008 / 2009, “...four years ago...” (Ibid. At [8]);
Respondent further submitted (at [4]) that “...the Complainant has not
demonstrated, nor has there been any finding of,
current unfitness to
Respondent submitted that he had been practising since April 2009 without
conditions; additionally, that the imposition of the
Order sought by the
Complainant would “...destroy the practitioner’s small remaining
practice.” The Tribunal notes
that this may well be a possibility but it
is irrelevant to the Tribunal’s
remains paramount in considering whether in all the circumstances, the Interim
Order sought by the Complaint, is
necessary. The Respondent submits that the
Complainant has not demonstrated that such Interim Order is necessary for the
safety of the public in the interim period prior to the
Tribunals’ determination of “...final protective orders.”
(Submissions at [13]). As noted above, the Tribunal’s hearing resumes on
26 September, 2012;
its submissions the Respondent distinguished a decision of the NSW Psychologists
Tribunal relied on by the Complainant—
HCCC v Whyte
, a decision in which that Tribunal imposed interim orders where it had
made a finding of
professional misconduct
but was yet to determine final,
protective Orders. The Respondent’s submissions included reasons as to why
this decision in
is of no assistance to the Tribunal in the instant
application;
considering any exercise of its discretion concerning the Complainant’s
application, the Tribunal has carefully considered
the submissions before it;
the relevant statutory provisions; the circumstances relevant to Decision No. 1;
the decision in
, above; and importantly, the Tribunal’s
conditions on the Respondent’s practice / registration since about April
noting also, that the Respondent’s conduct, the subject of the
complaints relevant to Decision No. 1, occurred in 2002-2003;
Tribunal is not reasonably satisfied in all the circumstances before it, that
the Interim Order sought by the Complainant to be
imposed on the Respondent
prior to the resumption of the Tribunal’s Inquiry on 26 September 2012, is
necessary for the protection
of the health and safety of the
Accordingly,
the Complainant’s application for the Interim Order is
