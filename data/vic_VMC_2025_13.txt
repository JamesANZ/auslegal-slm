HER HONOUR:
claim relates to the Plaintiff’s former employment with the First
Defendant at the Monkey Bean Café in Toorak. The
Plaintiff claims she was
underpaid the sum of $31,515.81 comprising unpaid wages, penalty rates, overtime
and superannuation (
Underpayment Claim
) and seeks the imposition of
pecuniary penalties against both Defendants (
Penalty Claim
) pursuant to
Fair Work Act 2009
defence was filed by either Defendant. On 13 January 2025 the Plaintiff made an
application for an order in default under r 13.04
Magistrates’
Court (Miscellaneous Civil Proceedings) Rules 2020
Miscellaneous
). On 30 January 2025 I granted that application and made an order that
the First Defendant pay the Plaintiff the Underpayment Claim
plus interest. This
decision concerns the Penalty Claim.
6 February 2025, the Plaintiff filed proposed orders for declarations and
penalties. On 12 February 2025 I made directions that
each Defendant be
personally served with relevant documents, and for the filing of affidavits and
submissions by both parties. On
13 March 2025 I granted the Plaintiff’s
application for substituted service on the Second Defendant. On 23 April 2025 I
further directions for the filing and service of affidavits and
submissions. I directed the Defendants to advise the Court if they
have an oral hearing in the matter, and that absent this, the matter would be
determined without an oral hearing.
to these directions, the Plaintiff filed an outline of submissions dated 12
March 2025 (
First Outline
), a further outline of submissions dated 14 May
Second Outline
) as well as further affidavits. The Plaintiff relies
on her affidavits of 29 January 2025 (
First Plaintiff Affidavit
Second Plaintiff Affidavit
) and the affidavits of Alessandra
Galetti dated 29 January 2025 (
First Galetti Affidavit
) and 13 May 2025
Second Galetti Affidavit
). The Plaintiff also filed four affidavits of
service of Alessandra Galetti, two dated 17 March 2025 and two dated 16 May
2025, based
on which I am satisfied that the Defendants have both been served
with all relevant documents.
Defendants have not filed any material in response to my directions and have not
advised the Court that they seek an oral hearing
in the matter. Accordingly, I
have determined the matter without an oral hearing.
RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ACT
Penalty Claim is made pursuant to s 546(1) of the Act, which provides
(relevantly):
...[A]n eligible State or Territory court may, on application, order a person to
pay a pecuniary penalty that the court considers
is appropriate if the court is
satisfied that the person has contravened a civil remedy provision.
Second Defendant’s claimed liability is based on s 550 of the Act, which
(1) A person who is involved in a contravention of a civil remedy provision is
taken to have contravened that provision. [note omitted]
(2) A person is involved in a contravention of a civil remedy provision if, and
only if, the person:
aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; or
induced the contravention, whether by threats or promises or otherwise; or
been in any way, by act or omission, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned
in or party to the contravention; or
conspired with others to effect the contravention.
am satisfied that this Court, an eligible State or Territory Court pursuant to s
12 of the Act, has jurisdiction to order a person
to pay a pecuniary penalty,
including a person taken to have contravened a civil remedy provision pursuant
to s 550 of the Act.
EVIDENTIARY REQUIREMENTS

determination of a proceeding in the Industrial Division
Rule 13.02 provides for a
proceeding to be commenced by a Form 13A complaint. Rule 13.03 requires (in the
circumstances of this matter)
a Defendant to give a notice of response
containing the information set out in Form 13B not less than 14 days after
service of the
complaint. Rule 13.04 governs the procedure for obtaining an
order in default of the filing of a notice of response by a Defendant,

(a) contain the information set out in Form 13C; and
(b) be accompanied by an affidavit in support which must contain the
information set out in Form 13D.
13D requires, amongst other things, that the Plaintiff verify by affidavit the
amount of the claim, the basis on which it is
calculated, and that the amount
remains outstanding.
Further, the
Plaintiff is required to verify any other relief sought in the following terms:
Any other relief sought and the basis on which it is sought is as follows:
specify any other relief sought and set out all material facts on which you
rely in support
consider an order for pecuniary penalties to be ‘other relief’ as

Fair Work Regulations 2009
(Cth), r 3.42(1)
ARE THE FIRST DEFENDANT’S CONTRAVENTIONS
ESTABLISHED?
First Plaintiff Affidavit and Second Plaintiff Affidavit both establish that the
First Defendant was required to pay the amount
of the Underpayment Claim to the
Plaintiff, and did not do so. I am satisfied that the Plaintiff was a casual
employee of the First
Defendant between 8 October 2018 and 8 February 2022,
performing the work of a restaurant and café employee, and the 2010
and 2020 Award applied to her employment. I am satisfied she was properly
classified as a kitchen attendant grade 1 until around
June 2019 and a food and
beverage attendant grade 2 from around July 2019. I am satisfied that the First
Defendant failed to pay
her the relevant minimum award rates of pay, casual
loading, penalty rates and overtime rates claimed, and failed to pay
superannuation
on these sums as required. Accordingly, the First
Defendant’s contraventions in groups A, B, C, D and E are established.
there is no affidavit evidence verifying the alleged failure of the First
Defendant to provide a copy of the relevant award,
Fair Work Information
Statement or the First Defendant’s alleged failure to make a copy of
records available on request. In
the absence of this evidence, contraventions F,
G and H are not established.
ARE THE SECOND DEFENDANT’S CONTRAVENTIONS
ESTABLISHED?
Plaintiff contends that s 550(2)(c) of the Act applies because the Second
Defendant engaged in conduct involved in the contraventions
and had knowledge of
the essential facts of the contraventions.
High Court in
Productivity Partners Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission
Productivity
affirmed that to establish that a person is ‘knowingly concerned’ in
a contravention, knowledge of the essential
matters which establish the primary
contravention is sufficient.
Further, the Court affirmed the principle from
Giorgianni v The
that knowledge that
those essential elements amounted to an offence is not
essential facts of contraventions A – E are the respective failures to
make payments due to the Plaintiff in respect of
minimum rates of pay, casual
loadings, penalty rates, overtime and superannuation under the 2010 Award and
2020 Award.
First Galletti Affidavit exhibits an ASIC extract for the First Defendant dated
12 July 2024 which illustrates that the Second
Defendant was its sole
shareholder and from 2 August 2019 was the sole director of the First Defendant.
Prior to that date, he was
not a director of the First Defendant. The Second
Plaintiff Affidavit establishes that since the commencement of the
Plaintiff’s
employment, the Second Defendant owned and ran the business,
initially with another person but since around August 2019, on his own.
Second Defendant at all times told the Plaintiff what, where, when and how she
should perform her work, including by giving her
instructions and telling her
how he wanted the café to run. He arranged payment of her wages, provided
her pay slips by email
and discussed all work related matters with her.
am satisfied that the relevant acts associated with the failure to make the
requisite payments in Contraventions A to E arose from
Defendant’s directions as to when the Plaintiff worked and the
underpayment of wages or allowances personally undertaken
by him. Further, from
2 August 2019 the Second Defendant was in effect the controlling mind of the
First Defendant. Accordingly,
I am satisfied that the Second Defendant had
actual knowledge as to these matters and was knowingly concerned in each of
these contraventions.
DETERMINING APPROPRIATE PENALTIES
Legal principles
Plaintiff relied upon the summary of legal principles for determining
appropriate penalties in my recent decision of
Readdie v People Shop Pty Ltd
I adopt that
summary, derived from
Australian Building and Construction Commissioner v
other authorities, without repeating it. I turn now to consider appropriate
penalties in accordance with those principles.
The contraventions, aggregation pursuant to s 557 and course of
Plaintiff’s proposed grouping of contraventions are as identified in the
table above. The Plaintiff does not contend that
each instance of a failure to
pay constitutes a separate contravention. Rather, the contravention of each
separate award provision
is considered a separate contravention (without
distinction between the two awards).
557 of the Act provides:
(1) For the purposes of this Part, 2 or more contraventions of a civil remedy
provision referred to in subsection (2) are ... taken
to constitute a single
contravention if:
(a) the contraventions are committed by the same person; and
(b) the contraventions arose out of a course of conduct by the person.
(2) The civil remedy provisions are the following:
(b) section 45 (which deals with contraventions of modern awards).
557 does not permit contraventions of multiple clauses within a single
industrial instrument to be taken to constitute a single
contravention.
Plaintiff’s proposed approach is consistent with this principle. Whilst it
is unclear whether contraventions of a common
clause across successive
instruments may be taken as a single contravention under s 557, it is
permissible to regard those matters
as a course of
and I consider it
appropriate to do so.
Nature and extent of the contravening conduct
Plaintiff contends that the contraventions occurred over a period of years, from
2018 to 2022, which demonstrates a lack of care
or diligence. The Plaintiff
worked 1,533 ordinary hours, each of which the Defendants failed to pay in
accordance with each of the
Award’s minimum rate or casual loading. The
Plaintiff worked 63.25 hours on Saturdays, 195.25 hours on Sundays and 100.25
on public holidays, for which she did not get paid penalty rates. The
Plaintiff worked 122.75 overtime hours between Monday to Friday,
5.75 overtime
hours on Saturdays and 37.75 overtime hours on Sundays, for which she did not
get paid overtime. I am satisfied based
on these matters that the conduct was
Plaintiff contends, and I accept, that the underpayments of her minimum rate of
pay placed her in a precarious position. Further,
she was deprived of
entitlements which compensate employees for matters such as work outside
ordinary hours, work in excess of ordinary
hours and the absence of leave
entitlements.
Nature and extent of the loss
Plaintiff suffered a total loss of $31,515.81 as a result of the contraventions
by the First and Second Defendants. The Plaintiff
contends, and I accept, that
loss is significant to her.
the First Defendant has failed to comply with the Court’s order of 30
January 2025, meaning that the Plaintiff continues
to be deprived of funds she
is entitled to.
Circumstances of the Defendants
First Galetti Affidavit and Second Galletti Affidavit verify that the business
of the First Defendant was continuing to operate
as at 30 April 2025. In the
absence of any evidence to the contrary I infer this remains the case.
Plaintiff contends that the First Defendant is a small business and accepts this
is a factor in determining the quantum of penalties,
notwithstanding this does
not excuse non-compliance. There is no evidence as to the financial
circumstances of either Defendant,
meaning there is no mitigating matter in this
Specific deterrence
Defendants have failed to engage in the proceeding, and the First Defendant has
failed to comply with the Court’s order
of 30 January 2025.
the Defendants are continuing to operate the business as a going concern and
accordingly, I infer, continue to engage and
manage staff.
again, the Plaintiff relies on a previous order of the Magistrates’ Court
of Victoria against the same Defendants in
Davidson v Kelyon Pty Ltd and
December 2024 for the payment of $8,025.97. The complaint in that matter alleged
contravention of award provisions by the Defendants
relating to casual loading,
penalty rates, overtime and superannuation over a period concurrent with the
Plaintiff’s employment.
Plaintiff contends this demonstrates that the non-compliance is more widespread
than simply the Plaintiff. I accept that the previous
order tends to reflect a
systemic rather than individual issue with the Defendants’ conduct.
consider that each of these factors makes specific deterrence an important
objective of an order for pecuniary penalties in this
General deterrence
Plaintiff referred to the observations of McDonald J in
Fair Work Ombudsman v
that employees in
the hospitality industry, in particular the café and restaurant sector,
are generally at higher risk of being denied employment-related
entitlements. Employees in these industries include a relatively high
low paid, young, low educated and migrant
that was a conclusion formed based on evidence led in that matter by the Fair
Work Ombudsman, and I do not have evidence
of that nature before me. I have not
had regard to this matter.
Nonetheless,
as the Plaintiff contended, it is important that the penalties imposed are
sufficient such that contravening the Act
is not viewed as a
‘cheaper’ way to run a business by other employers, or that
penalties are not seen as an acceptable
cost of doing business.
Maximum penalties
value of a penalty unit changed during the Plaintiff’s employment, on 1
July 2020, from $210 to $222.
this occurred approximately halfway through the period of the contravening
conduct, I consider it appropriate to apply an average
figure of $216.
Contraventions
of s 45 of the Act have a maximum penalty of 60 penalty units for an individual
and 300 penalty units for a body corporate.
Accordingly, the maximum penalty for
each contravention for the First Defendant is $64,800 and for the Second
Defendant is $12,960.
The Plaintiff’s proposed penalties are as follows:
A. Failure to pay Award minimum rates of pay
First Defendant $15,000
Second Defendant $4,000
B. Failure to pay casual loading rate
First Defendant $15,000
Second Defendant $4,000
C. Failure to pay penalty rates
First Defendant $10,000
Second Defendant $3,000
D. Failure to pay overtime
First Defendant $10,000
Second Defendant $3,000
E. Failure to pay superannuation
First Defendant $5,000
Second Defendant $1,000
cumulative total maximum penalties for contraventions A – E are $324,000
and $64,800 respectively. The cumulative total
penalties proposed by the
Plaintiff for contraventions A to E are $55,000 (approximately 17 per cent of
the maximum) and $15,000
(approximately 23 per cent of the maximum)
respectively.
the Plaintiff accepts that some reduction is warranted from these cumulative
totals in application of the totality principle.
totality principle requires an assessment of the total sum of penalties imposed
to ensure it does not exceed what is proper for
the totality of the contravening
The Plaintiff contends
that in light of the status of the First Defendant as a small business,
penalties ought to act as an adequate
deterrent but not be ‘unnecessarily
respect of the eight alleged contraventions, the Plaintiff proposed total
penalties of in the range of $50,000 – $60,000
for the First Defendant and
$10,000 – $15,000 for the Second Defendant. This took account of proposed
penalties for contraventions
F to H (not established) totalling $5,000 and
$1,250 respectively.
regard to all of the matters referred to above, I am satisfied that the
Plaintiff’s proposed penalties for contraventions
appropriate. I agree some reduction is warranted in application of the totality
principle. Applying this principle,
notwithstanding that contraventions F to H
were not established, I consider penalties at the bottom of the proposed range
of the Defendants is appropriate. Accordingly, I will order that the
First Defendant pay pecuniary penalties of $50,000 and the Second
Defendant pay
pecuniary penalties of $10,000.
Who should penalties be payable to?
Plaintiff was represented in the proceeding by the Young Workers Centre. The
Plaintiff’s Second Affidavit states:
I request that any pecuniary penalties awarded are made to the Young Workers
This is because:
(a) the Young Workers Centre assisted me for free, which meant I could pursue
this matter because I would not have had the financial
capacity to pay for legal
representation.
(b) the Young Workers Centre do important work assisting young people with legal
problems and I want them to be able to support other
young people in the same
way they helped me.
Plaintiff’s request was not supported by any submissions and I was not
referred to any authority as to the appropriateness
of so ordering. I am unaware
of a circumstance where an order of this nature has been made.
546(3) of the Act provides:
The court may order that the pecuniary penalty, or part of the penalty, be paid
(a) the Commonwealth; or
(b) a particular organisation; or
(c) a particular person.
Sayed v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union
Court held that the power in s 546(3) ‘is ordinarily to be exercised by
awarding any penalty to the successful
applicant.’
considering in detail the legislative history of ‘common
provisions in
predecessor legislation to the Act, the Court observed:
One may begin to understand, therefore, why it is that s 546(3) ...empowers the
Court to order that a pecuniary penalty, or a part
of the penalty, be paid to
the Commonwealth, a particular organisation, or a particular person. If a
proceeding for contravention
... is brought by the inspector, the inspector
being a public official of the Commonwealth, it may be expected that ordinarily
pecuniary penalty would be paid to the Commonwealth. If a union were to
bring the proceeding successfully, for the benefit of its
members, it may be
expected that the penalty would be paid to the union. If the union brought the
proceeding for the benefit of a
particular member, there might be payment of the
penalty to that member, on the basis he or she is a particular person to whom it
should be paid; or part payment to that member and the balance to the union. If
a person individually affected by a contravention
brought the proceeding, then
the penalty may be paid to him or her as a particular person. There is a certain
symmetry between the
person or entity authorised to prosecute an enforcement
proceeding and the person or entity to whom the penalty, if imposed, might
paid. This symmetry is recognised by the Explanatory Memorandum and
the circumstances in which an order may be made that penalties be paid to
someone other than the successful applicant, the
Court went on to state:
We accept that there may be cases ... where the penalty, or a part of the
penalty, should be paid to another person in the circumstances
described by Gray
at [44] ....
The examples given in the Explanatory Memorandum and by Gray J in
as to when a payment (or a part payment) might be made to a particular
person support the view that, depending on the factual circumstances
particular case, a particular person for whose benefit, in effect, the
contravention proceeding was brought may be the beneficiary
of a s 546(3) order
in the types of cases there referred
, s 546(3) has the dual purpose of firstly, accommodating the
range of persons who may bring a proceeding for contravention of a pecuniary
penalty, and secondly, accounting for a circumstance where the person who is the
‘applicant’ is not the person for whose
benefit the contravention
proceeding was brought. In this matter, ordering that penalties be paid to the
Young Workers Centre does
not meet either purpose.
Additionally,
the Court in
confirmed that an order under s 546(3) is not intended
to be compensatory or related to the incurring of
Similarly, in
Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union
v Fair Work
Ombudsman (The Botany Cranes
the Court held that
whilst departure from the ‘usual order’ may be justified in
‘extraordinary circumstances,’
doing so for compensatory purposes
was inconsistent with the ordinary exercise of the
discretion.
Compensating the
Young Workers Centre or covering its costs is not a basis for making the order
Accordingly,
I am not persuaded to depart from the ‘usual order’ that the
penalties be paid to the Plaintiff. It is of
course open to the Plaintiff to
privately give effect to her desire to direct monies to the Young Workers
Milford-Behn v Roberts
[2021] SAET 174

Employment Tribunal rejected an argument that an eligible State or Territory
Court could not order penalties against a person involved in a contravention
