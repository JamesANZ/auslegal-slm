ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION HANDED DOWN AT HEARING
[1] The Tribunal considered two applications lodged by
the Adult Guardian, those being a review of the current appointment of the
Guardian for KAB to enlarge the powers of decision-making and, further, for the
appointment of an administrator.
[2] The applications came before the Tribunal for a hearing on 3 September 2009,
at which time various parties were present including
RD, who is KAB’s
partner, FN, a friend of RD and KAB, and various other health professionals and
people involved in KAB’s
life, particularly in relation to her current
inpatient treatment at a hospital Mental Health Unit.
[3] At the commencement of the hearing, KAB was present by teleconference
facility at the hospital but elected to leave the room
participate in the remainder of the hearing. Her doctors, Dr K and Dr B
confirmed that KAB was not sufficiently
well to participate in the hearing.
Present also in the Tribunal hearing room were PB, social worker at the hospital
Mental Health
Unit, DR, and DJ from the Office of the Adult Guardian.
[4] KAB was born in 1974. She has a diagnosed mental illness of schizophrenia,
and in the health professional report provided by
Dr B on 4 August 2009, Dr B
also stated that KAB suffers from a borderline personality disorder. KAB was
presented to the hospital
Mental Health Unit in July 2009 by her partner, RD, in
response to a request by the Adult Guardian that KAB receive an updated
of her mental health. As a result of that attendance on that day, KAB
was admitted to the Mental Health Unit and was subsequently
placed under an
Involuntary Treatment Order. She is still under that Involuntary Treatment Order
and is still an inpatient in the
psychiatric intensive care unit at the
[5] The evidence in relation to KAB’s ability to make decisions for
herself was obtained from the written material provided
by Dr B and also from
oral evidence given by Dr K and Dr B at the hearing.
[6] In summary, that evidence was that KAB is not capable of making either
complex or simple decisions in all areas of her life,
because of her current
mental health issues. Her partner, RD who is present at the hearing confirmed
that KAB is not able to make
decisions for herself. RD advised the Tribunal that
he has been making decisions on KAB’s behalf for the past thirteen years
during which time he has been caring for her.
[7] The Tribunal is satisfied that KAB is not able to make decisions for herself
and therefore has impaired capacity. Having made
that finding, it is necessary
for the Tribunal to consider the two applications on the basis of need and
appropriateness.
[8] Dealing firstly with the issue of guardianship, as has already been stated,
KAB is currently inpatient at the Mental Health Unit
at the hospital, where she
has been since July 2009. Dr K advised the Tribunal that although it is
impossible to put a firm timeframe
on the length of her inpatient stay at the
hospital, it is expected that she will be there for at least several more weeks,
months, particularly given that her response to treatment at this stage
has been very slow. Dr K described the response as “minimal”.
explained that KAB is particularly unwell, in that she is still thought
disordered, disorganised and unable to participate in
most meetings concerning
her present circumstances and her future. Dr K further explained that KAB is
unable to weigh the benefits
of her treatment and is unfocused in her
interaction with the mental health staff.
[9] The Adult Guardian has been appointed as a decision-maker for KAB for
sometime now and seeks to have those powers enlarged so
as to include decisions
potential that KAB may,
after discharge from hospital, not be able to return to
her previous accommodation with RD, in which case there would be the need
determine more suitable accommodation for KAB.
[10] It is also unclear as to whether KAB would want to return to live with RD
because there are conflicting reports as to her views
may resolve as her mental health issues are better controlled with an
appropriate regime of medication and
she may in fact decide that she wishes to
resume her relationship with RD. RD cannot countenance that KAB would not wish
to live with him. Of course no one can predict what is likely to
happen in the future, but however her relationship proceeds with
future, it is certainly apparent that decisions about suitable accommodation
will need to be made, whether that is with
RD or without RD.
[11] For that reason, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a need for further
decision-making in relation to that aspect of KAB’s
life. There may
perhaps, in addition, be decisions required in relation to contact, should KAB
continue to express a view that she
doesn’t wish to have a relationship
with RD, especially if RD does not accept that.
[12] The Tribunal does not make any finding as to whether this is likely to
happen or not, because there is a long standing relationship
between RD and KAB.
However, on the basis that there is the potential for a decision in relation to
that as an appropriate enlargement of the
powers of the Adult Guardian.
[13] The existing powers of the Adult Guardian will also be continued in
relation to healthcare, provision of services, legal matters
not relating to
financial and property matters, and seeking help for or making representations
on behalf of KAB.
[14] So, the order of the Tribunal in that regard will be that the Adult
Guardian’s appointment will be continued for a further
period of two years
in those areas previously mentioned, namely accommodation, with whom KAB has
provision of services, legal matters not
relating to her property or financial matters and seeking help for or making
representations
on her behalf. Such representations may include matters
pertaining to KAB and RD’s daughter, RJ, and any other matters relating
ongoing issues with mental health services.
[15] In so far as the question of administration is concerned, the Tribunal is
further satisfied that there is a need for a decision-maker
in relation to
financial matters. It is accepted by all present at the hearing that KAB is not
able to make such decisions for herself,
and has not done so for many years.
Although RD and KAB operate a joint bank account and RD has attended to all
financial matters
on behalf of KAB for the period of time that they have been
together, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a potential for some
in relation to this issue in the future if it were to transpire that KAB did not
the Tribunal is satisfied
that the Public Trustee is the only appropriate appointee for managing
KAB’s financial affairs and
that order will continue until further order
of the Tribunal.
[16] The Tribunal makes no finding in relation to the present circumstances of
RD and KAB other than to say that there is no evidence
before the Tribunal that
RD has mismanaged KAB’s affairs. RD stated to the Tribunal that he has
always purchased clothing as
and when required for KAB, purchased her
medication, and purchased the food that they jointly required on a fortnightly
appointment of the Public Trustee is not a reflection on RD’s
management of joint finances up to this point, but simply an
acknowledgement and
acceptance of the fact that those matters may change in the future. This is not
yet able to be determined, particularly
given the current fluctuation in
KAB’s stated attitude in relation to her continuing relationship with RD.
Furthermore if there
were a need to make accommodation decisions in the future,
and if such decisions were contrary to RD’s wishes although in the
interest’s of KAB, then it would be impossible, in the Tribunal’s
view, for RD to attend to KAB’s finances
in such a way as to reflect that
change of circumstances.
