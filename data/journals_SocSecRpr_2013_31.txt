SECRETARY to DFHCSIA
Formal decision
Disability support pension: unlimited portability of payment, whether
applicant resumed resident in Australia
SECRETARY to DFHCSIA
Decided: 18th September 2013 by N. Bell
Ahern had been in receipt of disability support pension (DSP) since 1992. He
was diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia in 1988 and
found to be severely
disabled and manifestly incapacitated for work. After years of psychiatric
treatment, including the use of heavily
tranquilising anti-psychotic drugs,
Ahern found a way of managing his illness through meditation and adherence to
the teachings of
Brahma Kumaris following the suggestion of one of his treating
psychiatrists. It subsequently become important for him to be in India
as possible to access their teachings and from 1993, he travelled to India
frequently sometimes staying for more than one
From 1 July 2004, changes were made to the portability rules for DSP.
Generally all payments were made portable for up to 13 weeks
absence from
Australia. Previously, for Ahern, payments were portable indefinitely. Savings
provisions were also introduced which
meant Ahern could continue with indefinite
portability of pension provided he did not return to Australia as a permanent
On 5 May 2007, Ahern had returned to Australia to obtain medical treatment
had remained here since then.
In late 2010, Centrelink decided that Ahern was no longer temporarily in
Australia and was instead a permanent resident. The effect
of which was that he
lost indefinite portability and would be subject to the 13-week limitation.
The issue in this matter was whether Ahern’s presence in Australia over
the last 6 years amounted to residence.
Section 7(3)
Social Security Act 1991
(Cth) sets out a number of
matters that must be taken into consideration in deciding whether a person is
residing in Australia:
Australian residence definitions
(3) In deciding for the purposes of this Act whether or not a person is
residing in Australia, regard must be had to:
(a) the nature of the accommodation used by the person in Australia; and
(b) the nature and extent of the family relationships the person has in
Australia; and
(c) the nature and extent of the person’s employment, business of
financial ties with Australia;
(d) the nature and extent of the person’s assets located in
(e) the frequency and duration of the person’s travel outside
Australia; and
(f) any other matter relevant to determining whether the person intends to
remain permanently in Australia.
The Tribunal noted that the statutory factors should not be applied in a
mechanical way and that the relevance and importance of the
factors will vary
each case. Further that the factors were there as a guide and:
...... the decision-maker is also entitled to consider the converse of each
factor. For example, when
of the Act refers to ‘the nature of
accommodation in Australia’, the Tribunal would be entitle to consider the
of the applicant’s accommodation outside Australia. (Clifopoulos
& Department of Social Security
[1994] AATA 282
(1994) 36 ALD 745)
The Tribunal then went on to consider the factors as follows:
(i) The nature of the accommodation used by the person in Australia
The Tribunal noted that whilst in Australia Ahern was itinerant whereas in
India he stayed at the same guesthouse where he had stayed
for the last 15
(ii) The nature and extent of the family relationships the person has in
The Tribunal noted that whilst Ahern had a brother and stepmother in
Australia he had not seen them since his return in 2007.
(iii)The nature and extent of the person’s employment, business or
financial ties with Australia
The Tribunal noted that Ahern had not been employed for 21 years and drew no
income from the trust which administered his parents’
estate in Australia.
Whilst Ahern had an Australian bank account into which his DSP was paid and
which he accessed whilst in India,
he told the Tribunal that he planned to
transfer to an ANZ account in India.
(iv)The nature and extent of the person’s assets located in
The Tribunal noted that whilst Ahern had a 25% share in a property at Echuca,
the subject of a testamentary trust, his attempts to
realise his share had been
successful.
(v) The frequency and duration of the person’s travel outside
The Tribunal noted that Ahern had been spending time in India since at least
1997 and most of his absences in India were for extended
periods. However, Ahern
had been in Australia for the last 6 years. He initially had returned to
Australia because of a heart condition
and due to a miscommunication with the
airline had lost his ticket to return to India. Following Centrelink’s
decision to classify
him an Australian resident, he had stayed on in Australia
to appeal the decision.
Ahern also gave evidence of his numerous albeit unsuccessful attempts to
raise the money to return to India. The Tribunal noted that
his file showed that
Ahern had frequently requested payments of DSP in advance and had advised
Centrelink on numerous occasions that
he intended to depart imminently.
(vi) Any other matter relevant to determining whether the person intends to
remain permanently in Australia
The Tribunal noted that Ahern presented at the hearing as a somewhat reticent
but calm and intelligent person in contrast to documents
concerning his grant of
DSP in 1992 which showed that his psychosis was florid and disabling. Further,
Ahern gave evidence that whilst
he attended the local Brahma Kumari Centre, it
was no substitute for the higher spiritual advice which he had access to in
The Tribunal also noted that Ahern had not claimed rent assistance on the
basis of his view that he did not live here.
The Tribunal also noted the considerable efforts Ahern had to go to whilst in
India to maintain his visa status and his evidence that
he regarded India as his
The Tribunal referred to the case authorities noting that a person’s
intention had been given considerable weight in judgments
of the Federal Court
and previous decisions of the Tribunal, and concluded that there was evidence of
both his clear and persistent
intention to return to India and the absence of
ties to Australia. Accordingly, the Tribunal found that Ahern was not residing
Formal decision
The decision under review was set aside and instead the Tribunal decided that
Ahern was not an Australian resident and consequently
he remained entitled to
indefinite portability of his DSP.
