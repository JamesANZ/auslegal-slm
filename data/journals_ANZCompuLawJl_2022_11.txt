DEDICATED CYBER INSURANCE OR BUST –
LESSONS FROM INCHCAPE
BENJAMIN DI
AND ANTHONY
Blended insurance products commonly used to cover emerging specialist risks
such as cyber are increasingly likely to leave insured
organisations without
adequate protection.
The recent decision of
Inchcape Australia Limited v Chubb Insurance
Australia Limited
[2022] FCA 883
, demonstrates that organisations must
purchase specialised cyber insurance policies, to effectively cover the losses
and exposures
caused by cyberattacks and ransomware threats.
In this case Inchcape sought cover for ransomware losses under an Electronic
and Computer Crime (ECC) policy. This blended insurance
covers commonly found in
crime policies for funds transfer, redirection, and push payment frauds,
together with insuring clauses
for direct financial loss arising from computer
viruses and the modification of electronic data and electronic media.
Unfortunately, the ECC policy did not include any of the core insurance
clauses found in market standard cyber liability insurance
policies. Because it
lacked proper cyber insurance coverage, the court found that Inchcape was unable
to use the policy to recover
losses sustained after a major ransomware
I UNDERSTANDING THE KEY
Blended insurance products like Inchcape’s ECC policy are common in the
market and often attempt to cover both traditional risks
as well as emerging
specialist risks such as cyber liability.
By their nature, blended products contain narrower insuring clauses, when
compared against comprehensive risk specific wordings. Despite
this, blended
products can be attractive to organisations, and in some cases are more
cost-effective than pursuing specialist risk
policies such as a cyber insurance
policy. They may also be easier to obtain than specialist products, as they
often require fewer
underwriting questions to be answered.
However, as the Inchcape decision demonstrates, blended products
can leave significant uninsured gaps in insurance programs, unless
carefully analysed against an organisation’s key exposures and matched to
specific insurance needs.
In this case, Inchcape sought coverage for financial loss sustained following
a ransomware attack which included:
1. repairs and/or replacement of hardware, software, and data, including
investigation costs
2. hardware and data recovery costs
3. resource and additional staffing
All of these would have been affirmatively covered under a specialist cyber
liability insurance policy and are losses commonly sustained
ransomware attacks. The court found that Inchcape, in relying on an ECC policy,
was not covered for the ransomware
Where other organisations have included blended wordings in their insurance
programs or have failed to procure a specialist cyber
insurance policy, they
will be exposed to a similar uninsured fate. Given the Inchcape decision, each
organisation should carefully
investigate whether they hold sufficient insurance
that appropriately addresses their realistic cyber exposures and consider the
need for specialist cyber insurance.
II CYBER RISKS IMPACT
INSURANCE PROGRAMS AS A WHOLE
The Inchcape decision
also highlights the need to examine how an
organisation’s entire insurance program collectively responds to cyber and
risks. WTW’s recent Global Directors Liability Report
identified that cyber-related issues were the top risk concerns for respondents
for 2022 with 65% saying the risk of cyberattacks was “very
significant” or “extremely significant,” and
59% saying they
fear a “very significant” or “extremely significant”
exposure to cyber extortion
In handing down the Inchcape
decision, Justice Jagot highlighted that
cover under the ECC policy was limited to the “direct financial
loss” sustained
While this language is
common in crime policies, it is immediately problematic for claims caused by a
cyber event, because the nature
and extent of a cyber loss is determined by:
• the intervening steps taken by the insured after the attack including
how they investigate the suspected incident
• any decisions taken to shut down and isolate parts of their IT
environment
• the extent of engagement with the malicious actor
• the type of restoration work performed.
These intervening acts reduce the proximate cause, and add an element of
indirect or consequential losses, which make wordings like
those under the ECC
policy significantly less likely to respond.
Some cyber events will however create direct financial losses, particularly
where an authentication compromise or fraudulent instructions
result in the
organisation losing or transferring funds to an incorrect party.
Similar tensions can also arise in situations where an organisation’s
cyber and technology exposures may also create liabilities
under Directors and
Officers, Professional Indemnity, and Property Insurance. In some cases, covers
may be impacted by specific cyber
exclusions which are commonly being added to
traditional wordings. This makes obtaining overall coverage for technology risk
difficult, and often requires a higher level of expert advice so that the
organisation is properly advised on best-in-class insurance
options and
potential areas of risk that are not insurable. Without this advice, it is
difficult for the organisation to make an
informed risk management decision.
For large and complex organisations, there is often strong benefit to engage
with your broker to examine how all the relevant wording
interplays, and the
extent to which technology exposures may require multiple insurance policies to
address key exposures.
III WHY CYBER RISK AND
INSURANCE EXPERTISE IS CRITICAL
The Inchcape judgment demonstrates that cyber risk management and cyber
insurance are complex matters. Indeed, in parts of the ruling,
it appears that
even the Court struggled with the intricacies of cyber incident response
management and misunderstood how certain
triage tasks were conducted directly
following the ransomware event.
Cyber security and risk management is a new industry, and few experts know
how to properly bridge these topics. Cyber insurance is
particularly complex, as
it requires knowledge of both the cyber risk landscape and rapidly evolving
insurance products created to
meet this risk.
In the current market there is significant variance between the insurance
policies offered by different carriers, and the underwriting
information
required to obtain cyber insurance. Those wordings which seem cheaper or easier
to obtain, and often deliberately drafted
to reduce the insurer’s
exposure. These solutions may be suitable in some instances, but if they are not
properly scrutinised,
can result in the insurance program failing to meet cyber
Had Inchcape obtained support from a dedicated cyber insurance expert it is
unlikely an ECC policy would have been recommended as:
1. It contained extremely narrow causation language requiring both that
Inchcape suffered direct financial loss, and further that
this must directly
arise from a small numbered of covered incidents;
2. The wording did not properly call out the incident response costs and
steps which Inchcape would need to perform following a major
cyber event, or the
key ransomware losses that the organisation would suffer;
3. The insuring clauses in the policy did not address the range of malicious
acts which are commonly employed by modern ransomware
and cyber threat
4. Hurdles in the policy that required damaged or destroyed electronic data,
electronic media, or electronic instruction, do not reflect
how most modern
cyberattacks and cyberextortions are performed. This created further coverage
uncertainty; and
5. General conditions in the wording imposed significant limitation of the
covers in the policy relevant to cyber events.
