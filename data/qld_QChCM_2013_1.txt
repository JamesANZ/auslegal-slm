SOLICITORS:
[1] The defendant child is before the court for sentencing on a range of
offences. The offences include breaches of two separate
probation orders, one
having been made in the Children’s Court of Queensland and the other
having been made in the Holland
Park Children’s Court.
[2] On 2 August
2013, a pre-sentence report was received by the sentencing court.
August 2013 I indicated my intention to:
1. commit the breach of the Children’s Court of Queensland probation order
to the Children’s Court of Queensland; and
2. revoke the probation
order made in the Holland Park Children’s Court and resentence the
defendant child on the charges originally
before that Court (the ‘Holland
Park offences’).
[4] It now submitted that, as a consequence of my intention to resentence the
defendant child on the Holland Park offences, the effect
Justice Act 1992
(the ‘Act’) necessitates the preparation of a
further pre-sentence report in relation to the Holland Park offences because
had not been ordered when the defendant child was sentenced at first instance.
It was submitted that this is so, despite a presentence
report already being
before the sentencing court. That report postdates the Holland Park offences.
Although, I note that the pre-sentence
report was made for the purpose of the
offence of breaching the probation order that arose from the Holland Park
[5] From a practical standpoint,
it has been submitted that the only further material likely to be provided in a
further pre-sentence
report would be a Remand In Custody report as the one
presently marked as exhibit A to the pre-sentence report before the sentencing
court does not take into account periods of remand that were relevant to the
Holland Park offences. It was conceded that but for
of the Act, this could
otherwise be cured by the chief executive providing the court with an additional
Remand In Custody report.
[6] Unlike the question before the Court of Appeal
the question before me is whether a
detention order may be made in respect of the Holland Park offences being
offences committed
before the offences for which the pre-sentence report was
Section 151
of the Act relevantly provides:
(1) A court, before it sentences a child found guilty of an offence, may order
the chief executive to give to the court a pre-sentence
report concerning the
(2) Subject to subsection (9), the report must be made for the
purpose of the sentencing of the child for the offence.
(7) The chief
executive must cause the pre-sentence report to be prepared in documentary form
and given to the court promptly.
(9) For subsection (7), it is enough if the
chief executive gives the court further material to be considered with another
prepared for another sentencing of the child that happens on the same
day. [my emphasis]
[8] The words of
and (9) suggest that when a pre-sentence report is
ordered it must be made for the purpose of the offence upon which the child is
to be sentenced and that if another sentence is to proceed on the same day, the
chief executive can provide further material to be
considered with the report
i.e. a separate report is not required.
Section 207
A court may make a detention order against a child only if it has first—
(a) ordered the chief executive to prepare a pre-sentence report; and
(b) received and considered the report.
[10] Despite the decision in R v S
distinguishable on the basis that the question to be determined by the Court of
Appeal was different to that before me, the
decision remains a relevant
statement of the principles applicable to
[11] As noted by Pincus J.A. in R v S
“The section does not expressly require that the order for preparation of
a presentence report must follow upon, rather than
precede, the occurrence of
the offence.
...the justificatory effect of a presentence report can
cover only a sentence imposed in the course of the sentencing process in which
the order for the report was made. But I see no reason to treat the sentencing
process for this purpose as excluding sentencing
for an offence being considered
with those which prompted the making of the order for the report.”
[12] And as further noted by Shepherdson J in R v S
“I would add that in my view the
pre-sentence report referred to ... must be in respect of at least one of the
offences, if
more than one, in respect of which the detention order is
subsequently made by the sentencing
[13] Accordingly, I conclude that a sentencing
court can make a detention order in respect of offences committed before the
for which the pre-sentence report was made, provided a detention order
is also being made for at least one of the offences for which
the pre-sentence
report was made.
[14] In the present matter, I find that the following are
the relevant considerations:
1. the pre-sentence report before the sentencing court:
(a) is comprehensive; and
(b) pertains to offences for which detention
orders may be made.
2. that the preparation of another pre-sentence report will to a large extent
involve duplication of the information already addressed
in the pre-sentence
report before the sentencing court.
3. the only information not already
before the sentencing court is the Remand In Custody report relevant to the
Holland Park offences
and this can be readily cured without the need for a
further pre-sentence report.
4. the costs associated with preparing
pre-sentence reports is borne by the public purse.
[15] As such, I am not satisfied that it is necessary to order the preparation
of the further pre-sentence report in this matter.
