Legal Aid Queensland for child
[1] This is a matter of a application for a Child Protection Order by Janelle
McNamara a appointed authorised officer under the
Child Protection Act 1999
respect of the child MRT, born in 1991.
[2] The original application was for
short term custody however the application was amended to one that the Chief
Executive be granted
guardianship of MRT.
[3] The matter proceeded over two
days of sittings in the Magistrates Court at Atherton on 1 March 2007 and 24 May
[4] The Applicant was represented by Mr Ross a Principal Lawyer for the
Crown Solicitor. Mr Pohlmann Solicitor from Legal Aid Office
Queensland appeared
as the Court ordered separate representative for MRT. The Respondent Mother ML
appeared in person unrepresented.
[5] The provisions of the Act that are
relevant to the application and to which I have had particular regard
• Definition of Child Protection Order
• Section 4
– Protection of Children
• Section 5 & 104 – Welfare
and best interests of Child are Paramount
• Sections 9 & 10 –
Who is a Child in need of Protection
• Section 54 – Authorised
Officer may apply for a Child Protection Order
• Section 56 –
• Section 59 – Making a Child Protection Order
• Section 61 – Types of Child Protection
• Section 62 – Duration of Order
[6] The matters that
require particular determination by me are set out in Section 59 of the
[7] The material is extensively set out in the affidavits of the
parties, the exhibits, and the testimony of the witnesses. As well
received lengthy written submissions from each party. I do not intend referring
at length to the material. I accept the submissions
of Mr Ross and Mr Pohlmann.
The Respondent Mother has conducted a negative response to the application
attacking the Department and
other witnesses at every opportunity. While I do
not intend making any findings in respect of the allegations of physical abuse
against the Respondent Mother the Respondent Mother’s conduct of
the matter, MRT’s wishes and the evidence of the witnesses
support of the application allow me to make the order sought.
life is as set out in the material. He was born in Ethiopia and together with
his younger brother MG was adopted by
the Respondent Mother.
[9] MRT suffered
tragically as a young child and one must expect that those experiences will
continue to impact on him during his
[10] It appears on the surface
that MRT was progressing reasonably well. At school he was described as an
ordinary young person with
normal behavioural problems. It is apparent though
that he was not settled and at age 13 he ran away from the Respondent
[11] MRT’s relationship with the Respondent Mother has now
substantially broken down. That relationship may not yet be irreversibly
destroyed, but there is no doubt that any rebuilding or reunification will take
some considerable time, and a lot of goodwill from
the Respondent Mother and
MRT. Presently I do not believe that the Respondent Mother has the will or the
ability to give to that
process what would be required of her.
Respondent Mother makes the point that there is no corroboration of the
incidents complained of other then for the matters
that she refers to i.e. his
lying, stealing. While I have indicated that I do not believe that it is
necessary for me to make findings
in respect of the allegations of physical
abuse, namely the burning with the iron and the chipping of the tooth, these are
issues which add to the overall concern for MRT’s welfare. This
matter was not conducted as a criminal trial, MRT did not give
evidence. Matters
relating to the child protection history are adequately referred to by Mr Ross
in his submissions. On the one hand
the Respondent Mother opposes the making of
the order sought, but on the other her position as expressed throughout her
filed materials and at the hearing gives no confidence that she would
have any desire to have the care of MRT other than on her dictated
terms. This
attitude is no doubt what was at least partly responsible for driving MRT out in
the first place. The Respondent Mother
in this regard does not display any overt
sign of maternalism, compassion or love toward MRT.
[13] At the end of the
day I am satisfied that MRT was a troubled child who voluntarily left his
mother’s home and went into
care. While in care he has continued to
exhibit behavioural problems and has now been placed in the care of a second
carer, Ms Fox.
MRT is all but 16 years of age. Through his representative Mr
Pohlmann MRT advised the Court that he does not wish to return to the
his mother. There has been plenty of opportunity over the last couple of years
for a co-operative approach between the Department
and the Respondent Mother to
bridge the gap which existed at the time when MRT left the Respondent
Mother’s home. I can have
no confidence that this situation is going to
change over the next few months or even in the medium term.
[14] MRT left his
mother’s home; he does not want to return. The Respondent Mother does not
appear to appreciate this. The
Respondent Mother has not attempted to understand
MRT’s attitude or soften her approach to his return. The Respondent Mother
has filed voluminous materials full of anger and rage at the Department and
individuals. It is a shame that she has not worked positively
with MRT and the
Department towards reunification. Pages of free flowing vitriolic attack do
little to assist in the determination
of this important issue in accordance with
the relevant legislation.
[15] According to the Respondent Mother there is no
doubt that the Applicant, Ms Fox, Mr McDonald and Ms Scheftsik conspire against
here with their misrepresentations, bias, and omissions. It begs the question
– why? I accept the above persons as having provided
me with professional
objective evidence relevant to the question at hand.
[16] I accept and here
repeat the summary and conclusions of Manya Scheftsik dated 11 December
was initially an apparently complex case that has turned out to be
straightforward in many respects. [ML] took on the parenting
of two boys from a
different culture and background and when these differences became the source of
conflict between her and MRT,
their relationship broke down. [ML] appears to
have taken a rigid and inflexible approach to parenting that she defined in
terms of success and failure. I have developed the opinion that the more
[ML] felt she was failing with MRT, the more control she
tried to exert over
him, until failure became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It is my clinical experience to have encountered many such broken down
relationships between parents and children, especially as the
children move into
adolescence. One typically functional solution to broken down parent-adolescent
relationships is to have the young
person reside with family friends or
relatives in order to give all family members a break from ongoing conflict.
This allows relationships
and closeness to be rebuilt while garnering support
from sources that are not directly involved in the familial conflicts. A useful
perspective is generally also derived about the development tasks involved in
moving the young person through adolescence to adulthood
without becoming
distracted by the rebellion, experimentation and separation that are features of
this period. Unfortunately, [ML]
was not able to remain emotionally connected to
MRT in a way that allowed their relationship to become functional again while he
stayed with his late godmother.
MRT was able to clearly annunciate his wishes and he will be able to obtain
the support of DoChS in the meeting of his protective
and developmental needs.
[ML] has stated to me that she is not prepared to sacrifice her relationship
with Gene for MRT. It is clear
to me that [ML] has resiled from one of the
primary requirements of parenting that is to make sacrifices for one’s
As such, any plan that [ML] has put forward is unlikely to be
associated with success due to the absence of goodwill on her part.
professional opinion is that the relationship between MRT and [ML] is broken
down to the extent that reunification is not possible
at this time. MRT’s
wishes now represent the basis for the best plan available to allow him to meet
the developmental tasks
of adolescence.
[17] The Respondent Mother relies on an “affidavit” of MRT’s
brother MG aged 12. As I am able to inform myself
in these proceedings as I
think appropriate I accept the statement on face value. I must have concern for
the reunification of the
family given MG’s statement (amongst others)
“I especially NEVER want him to come near me if mum’s not with
This is truly sad, and is a reflection on the way that the Respondent
Mother has responded to the issues being experienced by MRT.
conduct of the Respondent Mother’s case casts real doubt on her ability to
care for MRT.

[21] A Family Group meeting was held on 6 February
[22] A Case plan is attached to the Affidavit of the Applicant sworn on
15 February 2007 filed in the Court, and is appropriate to
MRT’s present
situation. The case plan requires review before 6 August 2007.
[23] The Court
ordered Conference was conducted in Cairns on 18 October 2006.
[24] The Court
has already made the following orders:
• Temporary Assessment Order 7
January 2005
• Court Assessment Order 11 January 2005 (Revoked 25
January 2005 and MRT was placed with his Godmother. After his Godmother’s
death in April 2005 the Respondent Mother agreed to a placement with parental
consent for MRT with a Departmental carer.)
• Consent short term Child
Protection Order granting custody to the Chief Executive 5 July 2005. This order
has been extended
to the present time.
[25] The relationship between MRT and
the Respondent Mother has broken down substantially, if not irretrievably, to
the extent that
MRT fears the Respondent Mother and does not wish to have
inability to accommodate MRT’s special needs as indicated by the manner in
which she conducted her representation bring me
to the conclusion that I am
satisfied that MRT is a child in need of protection and that the order sought is
appropriate and desirable
for his protection. The Respondent Mother’s lack
of flexibility has been referred to by others and is evident throughout the
material, no where less so than where the Respondent Mother in her submissions
at page 16 makes what may be interpreted as a threat
that if MRT is not returned
to her he will be cut off from the family, she says; “In custodial care,
MRT will be very soon
on his own with no true or enduring family
[26] MRT refuses to have any contact with the Respondent
Mother. The Respondent Mother has no regard for the Department or its officers.
There exists an impossible unworkable situation that clearly indicates that any
working association between the two would fail. I
am satisfied that the
protection sought to be achieved by the order is unlikely to be achieved by an
order on less intrusive terms.
[27] For the reasons that I have already
stated I am satisfied that MRT’s need for emotional security will be best
long term by making the guardianship order. To make any other order
would be to place MRT in a situation of continuing rebellion
against the
Respondent Mother and would disrupt his education and vocational
[28] The order that I make is that:
The Chief Executive be
granted long term guardianship of the child MRT.
