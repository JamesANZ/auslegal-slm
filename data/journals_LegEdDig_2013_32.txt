Barker, D --- "From the Editor" [2013] LegEdDig 32; (2013) 21(3) Legal Education Digest 3
Emeritus Professor David Barker AM
FROM THE EDITOR
By the time this edition of the Digest has been published the Australian
Federal Election will have taken place. This will obviously
have implications
both for legal education and the federal legal system, particularly in the area
of human rights which has recently
been the subject of a debate between the
current Government Attorney-General the Hon. Mark Dreyfus QC and the Shadow
Attorney-General,
Senator the Hon. George Brandis SC.
On a more parochial level consultations are taking place for the
internationalisation of the law degree in Australia with globalisation
services becoming increasingly relevant to Australasian legal practice.
Among the staff of the Digest everyone is looking forward to renewing
personal contacts with both our authors, readers and the law
publishers at the
forthcoming ALTA Conference to be held at the ANU during the period 28 September
to 2 October.
In this respect it is of particular interest that the book reviewed in this
edition is a guide for law students and is by a former
Dean of the University of
Sydney Law School, Professor David Weisbrot AM, with a foreword by the Hon.
Michael Kirby AC, CMG, who
is also a well-esteemed colleague of Australian law
The topic of the book review sets the tone for articles digested in this
edition with the first article being under the heading of
Assessment Methods
in which Ferguson and Lee explore the potential for using online simulated
group based learning in the creation of sustainable assessment
practices. The
authors explain how this was achieved by the use of a process known as SIMPLE
which stands for SIMulated Professional
Learning Environment.
Under the heading of
Clinical Legal Education
Galowitz describes both
the opportunities and the challenges faced by participants in an
interdisciplinary clinic-the Medical-Legal
Advocacy Clinic at New York
University School of Law (MLAC), a medical and legal collaborative project.
does not often form the basis for a heading in the Digest but
it is the most appropriate title for Grose’s account of his experiment
developing an outcomes-based course involving estates and trusts. The course was
intended to answer the challenge for legal education
to better prepare students
for their role as lawyers.
is both the heading and part of the title of Knake’s
project involving the education of future lawyers in entrepreneurial and
innovative approaches to future legal practice. The author explores the variety
of courses developed on this theme by Stanford Law
School, Georgetown Law Centre
and also the author’s own law school, Michigan State University School of
Law. He also describes
the recently launched ReInvent Law, a law laboratory
devoted to technology, innovation and entrepreneurship in legal services. The
newly appointed Hon. Chief Justice James Allsop of the Australian Federal Court
has his article regarding continuing judicial education
considered under the
Judicial Education
. This contains a wide-sweeping review of
continuing judicial education throughout Australia at Commonwealth, State and
Legal Education Generally
is the heading for a new paradigm for legal
education proposed by Bemellen van Gent. In this article the author argues that
century legal education paradigm needs to address
what the legal profession now entails, what issues the legal profession deals
and what legal competences are required, to solve legal problems cheaply,
efficiently and in a client friendly manner. The article
also stresses the need
to acknowledge that the law school now prepares for more legal professions that
that of the attorney-at-law,
solicitor, barrister or equivalent and that gives
rise for a new definition of the legal profession. the article incorporates a
well-constructed
argument to support this view.
is the heading for three articles reflecting its increasing
importance as a subject embracing most areas of legal education. In the
article Ailwood, Easteal, Sainsbury and Bartels describe a case study carried
out at the University of Canberra School of Law
linking research and teaching,
particularly in its use of research-led education (RLE). Much of the success of
the project depended
on the use of the University’s Unit Satisfaction
Survey (USS). In the second article Davis reports on the outcomes of his
conducted with students as co-authors of the publication of two
case-books, whilst in the third article Hutchinson and Duncan
their approach and outcomes with respect to doctrinal legal research. This is
an extremely instructive paper as regards
the progress which has been made in
relation to the development of the growth of Higher Degree by Research (HDR0
completion rates
for law over the last two decades. It also distinguishes the
difference between doctrinal research focussing on legal principles
social science research.
forms the heading for the article by Falkoff involving
innovative fiction workshop techniques for first-year students undergoing legal
writing classes. As the author states, teaching students how to critique their
work and that of others is one of the most difficult
lessons to impart.
is the heading for the article by Fruehwald which explores
the complex area of the neurobiology of learning and how it might assist
development of becoming an expert law teacher. This incorporates the development
of three basic principles of learning described
as the Unified Learning Model
(ULM) and five rules of learning, whilst
Teaching Skills
project- based learning model proposed by Hilbert and Ver Ploeg for teaching ADR
students on how to problem solve. This
involved the launch in 2003 by the
William Mitchell College of Law of a new experimental course in which interested
students were
given the opportunity to assume full responsibility for
undertaking a substantial and complex project for a real client.
The heading of
is used for the final article of this
edition by Broadbent and Sellman which explores the use of websites by law
schools in their
involvement with their students. This article takes up the
theme put forward by the Browne Review which argued for greater availability
material relating to Law Schools, not just to inform students but other
stakeholders as well. This proposal incorporates the requirement
North American context for Key Information Sets (KIS) that all Institutions had
to provide from September 2012.
As always the breadth of articles digested in this edition of the LED is yet
another indication of the versatility and enterprise
of the modern law
