Invasive Use of Video Cameras by Neighbours [2004] NSWPrivCmr 1 (1 January 2004)
Invasive Use of Video Cameras by Neighbours
Due to legislative requirements and other constraints, not all privacy
related complaints can be dealt with by Privacy NSW. The organisation
however, always ready to provide professional advice and assistance as
demonstrated by the following case.
Mr & Mrs W became very concerned
when their next door neighbours installed video cameras under the eaves of their
house. While
it was appreciated that the cameras were installed for security
purposes, they were able to be directed at Mr & Mrs W’s
front door and
back yard, which meant that the neighbours could watch what the W’s were
doing and see who was visiting them.
Both Mr & Mrs W and their visitors
objected strongly to the camera installations and felt it was an invasion of
their privacy
and a diminution of their quality of life. They wrote to Privacy
NSW complaining about the matter and requesting assistance.
NSW Investigations Officer contacted the W’s and explained that our
legislation (the
only applies to public sector agencies and some smaller private organisations.
It does not apply to the conduct of individuals and
therefore Privacy NSW would
not be able to formally investigate the matter. Investigation Officers discussed
the matter at length
with the W’s, expressed their appreciation of the
W’s concerns and suggested the following alternative options:
• contact their local council and inquire as to whether any
developmental policy exists concerning residents’ duties and
obligations
with respect to the use of video surveillance. These matters are not governed by
Local Government by-laws or regulations
and individual councils would need to
devise and implement their own policies.
• try to have the matter
mediated with the help of a Community Justice Centre. This is a voluntary
process on the part of both
parties and may not prove a very practical option if
the relationship between the neighbours is particularly acrimonious.
undertake civil litigation in the courts. This would be the last resort due to
the cost, time and legalistic processes involved.
advised the W’s that they could contact the Community Relations Division
of the Attorney General’s Department
to see if the Government was seeking
public comment on this matter and find out if there were any proposals to enact
legislation
concerns, it might have empowered the W’s and reduced their
injustice. The W’s understood Privacy NSW’s reasons for not being
able to launch a formal investigation and
were appreciative of the assistance
and advice given to them.
