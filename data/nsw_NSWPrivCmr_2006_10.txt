Faulty Facsimile machine distributes health information [2006] NSWPrivCmr 10 (1 July 2006)
Faulty Facsimile machine distributes health
information
medical information.
The details listed below are a brief series of events both leading up to and
after this incident occurred.
The complainant’s spouse was issued with a medical certificate. This
certificate was provided to the spouse’s employer.
A day later the complainant received a phone call stating that a copy of
these documents had arrived elsewhere in the organisation
via the facsimile
machine. The complainant then rang the area office and made enquires on how /
why this document was sent to this
location. Later that day the complainant was
advised that the certificate had been faxed to various wrong locations. The
also advised from that they were aware of the incident and were also
checking on the complainant’s welfare.
Later the organisation apologised for what had occurred and stated that there
had been a machine malfunction.
The complainant was later advised that the fax machine had been tested and it
appeared to have no faults.
The complainant found this unacceptable and wrote to PNSW seeking an
investigation by an independent body and answers to how sensitive
information has been distributed to potentially hundreds of staff of an agency
when, apparently a fault with the fax machine
was identified some months
previously. The complainant also requested that any action by the agency include
a review of their procedures
pertaining to the transfer of sensitive
information.
In response to the complaint PNSW provided the complainant with detail about
Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002
(the HRIP Act) in particular.
When the agency looked into the matter they determined that there had been a
breach of the Health Privacy Principle 10 (use) and Health
(retention and security) with regards to the health information. The agency also
found that a copy of the certificate
had, in fact, been sent to various
locations of the agency in NSW. This was identified as a “use”
rather than a “disclosure”
of the information as it was sent within
the organisation. The review process included a service of the facsimile
machine. The agency
found that the machine was not functioning properly and this
allowed the machine to transmit the information to random numbers stored
machine. The machine was subsequently replaced.
The agency provided the complainant with an apology. The agency also made a
recommendation that in future a fax cover sheet be used
that clearly identified
the sender and the recipients and that the cover sheet include a disclaimer
alerting unintended recipients
to notify the sender if the fax was received in
the wrong place and to destroy the document. The agency also added an automatic
to their email system to provide better protection for personal
information.
An instructional circular was also to be issued to ensure that correct
procedure was followed when sending a facsimile.
