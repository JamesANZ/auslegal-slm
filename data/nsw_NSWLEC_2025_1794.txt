parties’ decision if the parties’
decision is a decision that the
Court could have made in the proper exercise of its functions. In making the

accompanying the s 34 agreement,
and those requirements have been satisfied as
Substantially the Same Development
to s 4.55(2) of the EPA Act, a consent authority may modify a
development consent if:
(a) it is satisfied that the development to which the consent as modified
relates is the same or substantially the same development
as the development for
which consent was originally granted and before that consent as originally
granted was modified (if at all),
(b) it has consulted with the relevant Minister, public authority or approval
body (within the meaning of Division 4.8) in respect
of a condition imposed as a
requirement of a concurrence to the consent or in accordance with the general
terms of an approval proposed
to be granted by the approval body and that
Minister, authority or body has not, within 21 days after being consulted,
objected to
the modification of that consent, and
(c) it has notified the application in accordance with—
(i) the regulations, if the regulations so require, or
(ii) a development control plan, if the consent authority is a council that has
made a development control plan that requires the
notification or advertising of
applications for modification of a development consent, and
(d) it has considered any submissions made concerning the proposed modification
within the period prescribed by the regulations or
provided by the development
control plan, as the case may be.

development, the parties advise that:
(1) The modification application seeks consent to vary the approved substation
chamber, pump room and basement, stairs, lift core
and design of existing
balconies and facades, and associated landscaping and stormwater works;
(2) The amendments to the modification application agreed by the parties as a
result of the s 34 discussions do not substantially
alter the proposed
development in the modification application; and
(3) The parties are satisfied that the modification application adequately meets
the requirements of s 4.55(2)(a) of the EPA Act.

Integrated Development
development consent being modified was integrated development within the meaning
of s 4.46 of the EPA Act as a water supply work

Transport for NSW (TfNSW) and was assessed in accordance
with ss 2.119 and 2.120
of the State Environmental Planning Policy (Transport and Infrastructure) 2021
(the Transport SEPP), however
these are not provisions that require
concurrence.
Respondent advised that on 30 May 2025, the modification application was
referred to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for a
response. No objection was
State Environmental Planning Policies
parties advise that a number of State Environmental Planning Policies apply to
the site, as follows:
(1) State Environmental Planning Policy (Housing) 2021:
(a) Due to the limited nature of the changes, no further assessment is required
with respect to the permissibility provisions or
the “Non-discretionary
development standards” at Ch 2,
of the State Environmental Planning
Policy (Housing) 2021 related to Co-Living Housing, as addressed in the
Statement of Environmental
Effects prepared by Evolution Planning, revision date
6 August 2025 (revised SEE);
(2) State Environmental Planning Policy (Resilience and Hazards) 2021 (the
Resilience SEPP):
(a) In relation to
of the Resilience SEPP, consent has been granted under
the original development application for the residential use of the site.
recommendations provided in the Preliminary Environmental Site Investigation,
prepared by Environmental Consulting Services,
dated 8 July 2024, continue to
apply to the approved development, and no additional ground works or any change
of use is proposed,
as addressed in the revised SEE.
(3) The Transport SEPP:
(a) The site has a frontage to a classified road. The original development
application was referred to TfNSW for concurrence. The
proposed modifications do
not introduce any further assessment issues with respect to traffic generation,
parking, or the operations
of Botany Road, not do they hinder the ability of the
development to satisfy the noise insulation criteria under s 2.120 of the
SEPP, as addressed in the revised SEE.
is noted that a BASIX certificate is not required for the proposed development
pursuant to State Environmental Planning Policy
(Building Sustainability Index)
2004 for the erection of a new large boarding house, or alterations to an
existing large boarding
house. Specifically, the definition of a BASIX
building in the
Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2021
(at Sch 7) excludes a boarding house, hostel or co-living housing that
accommodates more than 12 residents, or has a gross
floor area exceeding 300
square metres.
parties confirm that the original development consent has been previously
assessed as complying with the requirements of these
Bayside Local Environmental Plan 2021
Bayside Local Environmental Plan 2021 (the LEP) applies to the site and to the
proposed development. Under the LEP provisions:
(1) The site is zoned E1 – Local Centre pursuant to cl 2.2 of the LEP;
(2) The proposed development continues to be permitted with consent in the E1
(3) I am satisfied that the proposed development continues to be consistent with
the objectives for development within the zone in
which the development is
proposed to be carried out.
4.3 of the LEP provides that a maximum height of buildings (HoB) of 14m applies
to the site. The parties advise that the height
of the approved development
varies from being largely compliant, at the mid-eastern parts of the building,
to exceeding the standard
by up to 2.2m at the western part of the building with
respect to the roof-top open space, left overrun and associated structures.
parties submit that the proposed additional non-compliance to the height
standard is justified on the basis of the consistency
of this modified building
element with the objectives of the height standard.
written request in accordance with cl 4.6 of the LEP to vary the height is not
required for a modification application.
4.4 of the LEP provides that the maximum Floor Space Ration (FSR) of 2:1 applies
to the site. The parties advise that the approved
development complies with an
FSR of 1.9:1. No change is proposed to FSR or gross floor area under this
modification application and
cl 4.4 is satisfied.
5.10 of the LEP relates to heritage conservation. The parties advise that
proposed modified development is not considered to
introduce any significant
adverse impacts on the heritage qualities of the Conservation Area or any listed
items in proximity of
the site, as addressed in the Heritage Assessment,
prepared by Weir Phillips Heritage, dated 17 February 2025.
6.1 of the LEP relates to Acid sulfate soils. The parties advise that the
Geotechnical Report prepared by Morrow, dated March
2023 accompanying the
original development application concludes: “The SPOS result indicates
that acidity (in the form of acid
sulfate soil materials) is not present within
soils at the site. An Acid Sulfate Soils Management Plan is not required for
at the site.” No additional groundworks are proposed and no further
action is required in this respect, as addressed in the
Statement of Environment
Effects , prepared by Evolution Planning, dated February 2025.
6.2 of the LEP relates to earthworks. The parties advise that no additional
groundworks are proposed, and the proposed modified
development continues to
satisfy cl 6.2 on the LEP, as addressed in the revised SEE.
6.9 of the LEP relates to active street frontages. The parties advise
(1) No change is proposed to the Botany Road ground floor frontage except for a
minor change to the fire egress, including an allowance
for water meters;
(2) The degree of activation along this street frontage does not change since
fire egress stairs may be included as part of an “active
frontage”; and
(3) The proposed development is considered to continue to satisfy the provisions
of the LEP, as addressed in the revised SEE.
Bayside Development Control Plan 2022
parties advise that the provisions of Bayside Development Control Plan 2022 (the
DCP) have been considered in the Respondent’s
assessment of the
development application (as amended) and the proposed development is generally
considered to be acceptable.
