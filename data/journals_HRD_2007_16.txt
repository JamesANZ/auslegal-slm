The Natural World: Does Religion AlienateUs or ConnectUs
The Natural World: Does Religion AlienateUs or
Lesa-Belle Furhagen
A traveler was on the roads under the hot sun. He begged for shade. The tree
gave it and then the traveler felt like staying with
the tree and building his
for an axe to cut the tree.
Then he begged for a handle for his axe from the
tree and the tree gave it. After he made the axe, he cut the tree and built his
house. But when the house was built, the traveler cried and felt lonely and hot.
Then he left that place in search of shade.
When the Abrahamic faiths look at their sacred texts, their Genesis and Noah
stories, it is clear that there exists an intimate relationship
between Creator
and Creation which cannot be dismissed. So why is it that these three faith
traditions have dragged their heels to
sit at the environmental table? By
understanding some of these reasons, perhaps a contribution can be made to the
existing groundswell
pushing Judaism, Christianity and Islam to take their
rightful place in the environmental struggle, the resolution of which could
humanity to a spiritual and religious renewal.
When searching for reasons why the three Abrahamic traditions have been slow
to address environmental issues, it is helpful to look
at how they perceive
‘God’ and our relationship to ‘God’. Lynne White in
‘The Historical Roots of
our Ecological Crisis’ said ‘[w]hat
people do about their ecology depends on what they think about themselves in
to things around them. Human ecology is deeply conditioned by beliefs
seems apparent that throughout history our faith traditions have been somewhat
complicit in developing an extreme anthropocentricism
which has contributed to
the current environmental situation.
Matthew Fox, a Christian theologian, argues that there has been a
‘reduction of a Trinitarian Godhead to a single person of
the Trinity.
What I would call Jesusolatry has so overtaken much of mainline (and all of
fundamentalist) Christianity that, in historical
terms, we can ask: Isn’t
this heresy, the loss of God the Creator and God the Spirit, to the extreme
situation of God the Redeemer?’
Judaism, as the first monotheistic faith, has been accused of generating the
split between humanity and the environment by repudiating
animistic religions,
which apportion divinity to various aspects of nature. Whatever the origins of
anthropocentrism the faiths themselves,
in this case Judaism, have equal
teachings and biblical references pointing humanity to environmental
stewardship. Whilst the Torah
calls for human dominion, interpreters argue over
whether or not this implies stewardship. Mordecai Kaplan contends that
theology which is not a plan of social action is merely a way of
preaching and praying. It is a menu without dinner.’
certainly points to an interpretation of stewardship over dominion.
With over a billion followers, Islam is a faith with perhaps the greatest
potential to have an impact on the environmental movement.
Like Christianity and
Judaism, Islam regards humanity as being at the top of the food chain, however,
with a directive from Allah
to protect the natural environment. Like the
Pentateuch and the New Testament, the Quran reveres the grandeur of a creation
from God: ‘And it is He who spread out the earth, and set
thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing) rivers; and fruit of
every kind He
made in two pairs, two and two; He draweth the night as a veil over the
Therefore, given the collective faith histories of Christianity, Judaism, and
Islam, it seems clear that God the Creator has been
diminished in our collective
thinking. Aquinas said: ‘A mistake about Creation results in a mistake
Fox asks the question, ‘[w]hy do we swamp
ourselves with biblical scholars as if all revelation is in a 4,500 year-old
and not in creation itself?’
Fox goes on to point out
that humanity has lost sight of the value of our mystical traditions and their
rich teachings about humans
and nature:
From Julian of Norwich to Thomas Traherne, from Hildegard of Bingen to George
Herbert, from Meister Eckhart to Walt Whitman, from
Thomas Aquinas to Annie
Dillard, from Nicholas of Cusa to Rachael Carson, from Dante to Wordsworth and
William Blake, we are gifted
with poets of the soul who speak the truth of the
sacredness of our lives, our bodies and the rest of creation.
It would seem to be the case that a modern secular
environmentalism is split from religions, which often appear exclusive and
from each other. Gary Gardner calls for a resolution to the centuries
old rift in the West between religion and the sciences. He
believes that
environmentalism cannot succeed unless it mobilizes religion, ‘that a
sustainable world cannot be built without
full engagement of the human
The ecosystem of the planet, or
as James Lovelock defined it, does not prefer
one religion or political system over another when it comes to environmental
sustainability.
So what does this mean for institutional religion? Is it still relevant and
will its bureaucracies respond quickly enough to embrace
the vocation of
environmental stewardship which can only happen in a culture of religious
tolerance and acceptance? Institutional
religion must expect to play a
significant role alongside scientists, environmentalists, politicians and
corporations if it is to
retain its currency and humanity in the long term.
History testifies to the fact that religion has helped determine how we view
and what actions are acceptable. Therefore, given the need for such
radical change both in our thinking and practice, it is only
logical to look to
religion alongside science and technology for providing the way forward in what
would seem the most urgent of
circumstances.
“Whatever the origins of anthropocentrism the faiths themselves... have
equal teachings and biblical references pointing humanity
to environmental
stewardship.”
Religion has to acknowledge its role as being more than simply
a belief in a transcendent deity. It is an orientation to the universe
humanity’s role in it. Religion in its broadest sense is a means whereby
society undertakes specific practices and rituals
that effect
self-transformation and community cohesion. Rather than focusing on an extreme
anthropocentricism, the monotheistic religions
should refer to those universal
stories, symbol systems, ritual practices, ethical norms, historical processes,
and institutional
structures that transmit a context for humanity embedded in a
world of meaning and responsibility, transformation and celebration.
In the end, the environmental crisis is also a spiritual one, which requires,
among other things, a spiritual solution that cannot
be confined to a single
faith tradition. Potentially sitting at the environmental table provides
Judaism, Christianity and Islam
with the opportunity to come together and find a
common spirit based not only in the idea of a Transcendent Deity but also of a
infused with the divine.
“Institutional religion must expect to play a significant role
alongside scientists, environmentalists, politicians and corporations
to retain its currency and humanity in the long term. ”
