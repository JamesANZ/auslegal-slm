Response received from Department of Health 24 January 2025
Coroner’s Recommendation (paragraph 79): I recommend the RCA’s recommendations set out in paragraph 54 are implemented in full.
* The Mental Health Hospital in the Home (MHHITH) documentation requires completion and endorsement within the next 3 months, and
it is to be made widely available. Response The MHHITH Operational Service Manual (OSM) has been completed and is operational. Documents
are available to all staff in the Strategic Document Management System from where all Department of Health policies and protocols
are accessed by staff.
* Entry into the record must reflect what service is being provided rather than an individual consultant’s name. Response: Naming
conventions are in place for all teams and services, and clinical entries clearly identify the clinician and clinician’s service
* The orientation program of MHHITH is to provide a comprehensive education session of the Digital Medical Record (DMR) documentation
processes. Response: Education and introduction to the DMR occurs as part of orientation for staff within all areas within SMHS (including
MHHITH). Regular monitoring of the health records occurs within the service.
* The MHHITH services admission criteria are to be revised to provide greater guidance on admission suitability for clients who have
made recent self-harm and/or suicide attempts
Response: The clinical needs of all individuals referred to the MHHITH and individuals within their care are discussed twice daily
at multi-disciplinary team meetings. Changes to admission status, including admission to the inpatient units, can occur through direct
discussion with senior clinicians, including out-of-hours through the Acute Care Stream umbrella.
* MHHITH is to consider access and availability for psychological intervention where it is clinically indicated, and it is either
to provide those interventions or to refer patients to services that can provide that treatment. Response: MHHITH have access to
the multidisciplinary team including social work, occupational therapist, medical staff and senior nursing staff all of whom have
received training in therapeutic approaches including ACT, DBT CBT. Access and referral to other services is undertaken, as required.
* Where consent is provided MHHITH is to ensure the involvement of significant others in the provision of collateral information.
Response: At admission, MHHITH collects and documents information about family/carers and other service providers. Consent for exchange
of information is obtained at the beginning of an episode of care. The General Practitioner is informed at the commencement and closure
of an episode of care. The introduction of the Carer’s Recognition Policy with associated action supports inclusion of significant
others in the collection of information and care provision.
Coroner’s Recommendation (paragraph 80): I recommend that in order for mental health patients to build trust and rapport with their
treatment providers that the number of medical and allied staff be limited to as few staff as possible in order to avoid the difficulties
highlighted in paragraph 46. Response: Statewide Mental Health Services strive at all times to provide continuity of care for mental
health patients. To ensure the provision of appropriate care 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. MHHITH has good handover and communication
processes in place. Twice daily reviews also ensure that care and support provision is adjusted continuously.
Coroner’s Recommendation (paragraph 81): I recommend the responses to Coroner McTaggart’s recommendations set out in paragraph
58 are finalised as soon as reasonably possible. Coroner McTaggart’s recommendations.
I. The design and establishment of a dedicated inpatient unit for adolescents or young persons between the ages of 12 and 25 years,
including treatment for those suffering from an acute state of mental illness or suicidality.
II. Consideration be given to the establishment of a multi-disciplinary facility for young person’s suffering from an acute state
of mental illness or suicidality, such facility to have a comprehensive through-care and after-care model to provide ongoing community–based
risk management.
III. The establishment of state-wide positions of suicide prevention co-ordinators to provide necessary outreach between discharge
from hospital and entry into appropriate services to assist with a streamlined approach to discharge planning, collaboration between
service providers and continuity of care;
IV. Hospitals offering emergency medicine consider developing and implementing a suicide risk assessment tool, to be applied consistently
on a state-wide basis where suicidal risk assessment is required.
i) The recent redevelopment of the RHH included a new 16 bed adolescent inpatient unit which is managed through the Paediatric Ward
with 2 Mental Health beds. This unit opened in 2020 and delivers an integrated model of care whereby mental health patients and paediatric,
medical, and surgical patients are supported in the one unit. Stage 3 of the RHH Site Masterplan Review 2020-2050 recommended the
redevelopment of the St Johns Park site as a campus of the RHH.
ii) Funds have been allocated to project manage, create and staff an adolescent and youth Inpatient unit.
iii) The Government’s response to the Commission of Inquiry into Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings included funding the creation
of an adolescent-youth inpatient mental health facility for Tasmania. In the 2024 Budget, there was a significant increase in funding
for CYMHS's out-of-home care program and CYMHS youth forensic program. Augmented funding will assist with interventions aimed at
addressing the high-rate suicide in these groups. The service will be integrated with CAMHS community and hospital-based services.
The Government commissioned two Safe Havens. The first Safe Haven opened in North Hobart in 2022. A second Safe Haven will have a
more youth/young adult focus and is part of the Northern precinct build planned for 2027. An additional build will occur in Devonport
in cooperation with Primary Health Tasmania. Both services will include in-reach from the CAMHS Youth Mental Health Team in the form
of consultation and provision of a group intervention to assist with management of emotional wellbeing. A new CYMHS campus has been
established and is running in Devonport.
iv) To assist people in hospitals experiencing suicidality, rather than creating suicide coordinators, a more robust approach to suicide
prevention is proactive follow-up. This is in place for all CYMHS consumers. Consistent with this, a new seven-day postdischarge
clinic has been established in the South; young people experiencing suicidality are proactively followed up, monitored, and reviewed
prior to service allocation and entry. A similar undertaking is planned for the North and North-West.
v) To assist with suicide risk assessment, a Comprehensive Care Plan is now in place across SMHS and includes individualised risk
assessments that inform care plans, safety plans and relapse plans.
