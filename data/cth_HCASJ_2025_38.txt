Supreme Court of Victoria and the Attorney‑General
for the State of Victoria ("the Writ").

support of his application for leave to issue or file the Writ, the applicant
swore and filed an affidavit dated 10 September 2025.
He also relies upon
two supplementary supporting affidavits, one sworn on 15 September 2025 and
another sworn on 17 September 2025.

the Writ the applicant seeks various relief, including a "formal written
apology" and an "expungement of all records, entries,
and data" in relation to
the applicant's conviction, and an order directing the proposed defendants to

victim of malicious prosecution". He also seeks, inter alia, that a writ of

applicant contends that various matters justify the grant of the relief he
seeks. Inter alia, the applicant contends, or deposes
to the facts, that: he was
the subject of a "fabricated void charge"; there was a conspiracy on the part of
the State of Victoria
against the applicant such as to give rise to a violation
of provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
Constitution
; the applicant was entrapped and evidence adduced
against him had been fabricated; the police engaged in a "campaign of coercion";
the applicant was the subject of "[g]ender-[b]ased [p]ersecution"; "[a]ctus reus
and mens rea were entirely absent"; there had been
a "[j]udicial [b]reach of
[s]tatutory [s]afeguards"; at various points in the appellate processes, there
had been "[j]udicial [f]raud";
and there had been various, unparticularised

discretion to refuse leave to issue or file a document will ordinarily be
exercised where the document appears "on its face to
be an abuse of the process
of the Court, to be frivolous or vexatious or to fall outside the jurisdiction
of the Court".
The concept
of abuse of process includes "an attempt to invoke the original or appellate
that is confused or manifestly
untenable".
The exercise of
the discretion to refuse leave "is appropriate only in the clearest of
application and the Writ are clearly confused and manifestly untenable. The Writ
includes (mostly unparticularised) assertions
of what the applicant alleges to
be wrongful conduct on the part of various persons or entities, some of whom are
proposed defendants
but others are not, and assertions of breaches of laws and
treaties without any rational elaboration. It appears that the Writ seeks
reagitate matters that have long been resolved adversely to the applicant,
including through the applicant's attempts to engage
appellate processes.
Neither the Writ nor the applicant's affidavits disclose any rational legal
basis for the relief that the applicant
seeks in the Writ.
