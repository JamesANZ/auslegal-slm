In the matter of an Appeal

AGAINST THE CONVICTION AND PENALTY OF TWO YEARS DISQUALIFICATION BY THE
HARNESS RACING VICTORIA STEWARDS FOR BREACHING AUSTRALIAN
HARNESS RACING RULE
JUDGE NIXON

Mr B. Pearce, Adviser
TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS
AT MELBOURNE ON 13 MARCH
2009 AT 2.05 P.M.
MR C. SALERNO appeared on behalf of himself.
MR B. DUNSHEA appeared on behalf of Harness Racing Victoria.
HIS HONOUR:
This is an appeal by Mr Charlie Salerno against his conviction on
a charge which alleged a breach of Rule 193(1) of the Australian
Harness Racing.
It is also an appeal against the penalty imposed by the stewards. Rule
193(1) is couched in these terms, "A person shall not stomach
tube a horse
nominated for a race or event within 48 hours of the commencement of the race or
event". The stewards convicted Mr
Salerno of a breach of that rule and he
was duly disqualified for a period of two years. The facts are that on 13
November 2008,
the day in question, the horse Spaghetti Western was scheduled to
run in the Lancefield Cup, November 30 pace which was Race 1 scheduled
at 6.30 p.m. at the night Kilmore harness meeting.
The appellant was the trainer of Spaghetti Western. He was observed by
the investigative steward Mr Rogers that afternoon stomach
tubing Spaghetti
Western. He was asked some questions. He did say that the horse was suffering
from colic. He was asked why it
hadn't been scratched but on his own admissions
before the stewards and here he is guilty of the offence because a person shall
stomach tube a horse nominated for a race within 48 hours of the
commencement of the race or event. Here was the appellant stomach
tubing this
horse while it was still a runner a few hours before the horse was due to
There were a number of very pertinent admissions made by
Mr Salerno to Mr Pearson and I would reject Mr Salerno's comment or
that he simply answered questions telling Mr Pearson what he, Mr Pearson,
wanted to hear or what he believed he wanted him to hear.
substantial admissions made at the stewards' inquiry. As it was put to him by
me, Mr Salerno said, "No, not off colour,
just wasn't herself. The race
really, because it was first up, was either like going to be a trial because she
was 100-1 in the
paper, so it was like a trial, and sometimes if the horse is
under 100 per cent I'll still try".
Again he was asked, "You thought you might take it to Kilmore to see
how it goes?". Answer: "I did, yeah". Mr Pearson: "Yeah".
said, "Yeah, that's the truth". I find the offence proved as a breach of the
rule Mr Salerno.
HIS HONOUR:
Thank you. The Tribunal regards the offence as a serious offence. A
message must be sent by stewards or Tribunals to those trainers
who are prepared
to chance their arm and breach the rules of harness racing. It is a very clear
rule that a person shall not stomach
tube a horse within 48 hours of the race.
In May 2008 after the horse bled you admitted that you'd stomach tubed that
got what I regard as a comparatively lenient penalty on that
occasion and my advisors agree entirely with that statement. Whilst
decision is mine, I'm confirmed by my advisors that the penalty imposed by the
stewards was a reasonable penalty in the circumstances.
Deterrence is important, that is deterrence to the individual offender
but there have been what can only be described since this
Tribunal commenced in
1984 in March of that year a spate of TCO2 cases. Strong efforts have been made
by the authorities to curb
the practice but trainers still break the rules of
harness racing. You had your warning in May. You had seven warnings by letter,
two in relation to this same horse, five in relation to another horse of yours,
over the next few months. Yet, on this particular
day, some hours before the
horse was to race and I'm satisfied would have raced at Kilmore given the
evidence of the stewards, you
were stomach drenching the horse. The penalty
that the stewards imposed I believe is reasonable and it's confirmed and it's
of two years disqualification. I will return the appellant’s deposit.
