Johns v Shire of Chapman Valley [2004] WATPAT 231 (24 December 2004)
IN THE TOWN PLANNING
APPEAL TRIBUNAL OF
WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Appeal No. 197 of 2004
[2004] WATPAT 231
Determined on the documents
Decision: 24 December 2004
B E T W E E N:
SHIRE OF CHAPMAN VALLEY
Mr P McGowan
(President)
Town Planning and Development Act 1928
Question of law
Cases referred to
The Tribunal:
1. The present appeal was against a decision made by the Respondent on 15 June
2004 in relation to a determination as to the proposed
location of a building
envelope at Lot 27 Royce Place, White Peak (“
the subject
2. By reason of the provisions of Appendix 6 of TPS 1 and those provisions that
deal with Special Rural Area 6 (including the subject
property) an application
was required in order to determine the location of any proposed building
3. At its meeting on 15 June 2004 the Respondent in one sense effectively
refused the proposed location nominated by the Appellant
but nevertheless
approved a separate location.
4. It expressed its decision thus:
“Council rescind
resolution 05/04-19 with respect to its refusal in relocating the Building
Envelope on Lot 27 Royce Place,
White Peak and proceed to grant planning consent
to adjust the envelopes sufficiently set back from the ridge line to ensure that
there is no overlooking of the adjoining residence on Victoria Location 2949 to
the satisfaction of the Chief Executive Officer.”
5. The appeal was heard by Mr Jordan on 14 October 2004. The hearing was
conducted at the offices of the Respondent at Nabawa. The
hearing included a
view of the subject property and its surrounds.
6. In a decision delivered on 9 November 2004, Mr Jordan determined as
“From my examination of this matter, I have
decided to uphold the appeal and approve a relocated building envelope as
(a) The northern boundary of the building envelope is to be set back 5 metres
from the northern boundary of Lot 27 extending between
the western boundary of
the building envelope, set back 125 metres from Royce Place and the eastern
boundary of the building envelope
set back 55 metres from the eastern boundary
(b) The western boundary of the building envelope is to be 50 metres long and
the eastern boundary 35 metres long. The southern boundary
of the building
envelope is a line between the southern ends of the eastern and western building
envelope boundaries.
(c) The Appellant is to lodge with the Respondent a plan showing this
relocated building envelope.”
7. On 9 December 2004 the Tribunal received two facsimile transmissions from the
8. Each of those is directed to me. I have previously indicated that the
approach to an application for review under
, particularly in
circumstances where an Appellant is unrepresented, is to be approached on a
generous basis.
9. Notwithstanding the lack of use of specific words containing reference to
, I am prepared to entertain the facsimile transmissions from the
Appellant as effectively an application for review by me under
Town Planning and Development Act 1928
10. As always there are two aspects to be satisfied. The first is that the
decision is one which was delivered by a member of the
Tribunal not being a
legal practitioner. Mr Jordan is not a legal practitioner and that limb is
therefore satisfied.
11. The second requirement is that there be a question of law.
12. There is no right of appeal on a merits basis. It is limited solely to a
question of law.
13. The two facsimile transmissions forwarded to me are read together but are
separate. Thus the second transmission is a commentary
on a paragraph by
paragraph basis of Mr Jordan’s decision. In essence such a commentary is a
combination of argument, repetition
of matters advanced before Mr Jordan and
merit-based criticism of the views ultimately arrived at by Mr Jordan.
14. The first facsimile transmission appears to be a more general entreaty. The
essence of the complaint appears in the following
wish to build on this flat area in the future, Geraldton has winds up to 45
knots (81 kms) and constant winds of approx 18
knots (32 kms). To buffer these
winds I have to design a different building for this unusuell [sic] Lot 27
General living. If the
wind is not buffered on top of the ridge it would be a
very miserable place to live.”
15. He then develops a further argument in relation to why it is that he says
that the location nominated by him should be been approved
by the Tribunal. This
is a merits based argument, one incidentally already received by the Tribunal.
It is not and does not involve
a question of law.
16. In the circumstances and in accordance with the provisions of
I affirm the order made in this matter by Mr Jordan on 9 November
