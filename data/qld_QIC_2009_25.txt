Rodney Whitson v Shane Golinski [2009] QIC 25; 191 QGIG 370 (24 July 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 7 August, 2009, Vol. 191, No. 12, pages
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Relations Act 1999
- s. 341(2) - appeal against decision of industrial
Rodney James Whitson AND Shane Randall Golinski
(C/2009/25)
PRESIDENT HALL
24 July 2009
On 19 March 2009, Rodney James Whitson, a Public Officer within the
meaning of the
Justices Act 1886
and an Inspector duly appointed under
the provisions of the
Industrial Relations Act 1999
, made a complaint
before a Justice of the Peace that between 17 October 2007 and 26 August 2008 at
Coolum in the Maroochydore Magistrates
Courts District, Shane Randall Golinski
(an employer) failed to make contributions for an eligible employee,
Joel Cameron Cross, to an approved superannuation fund at the level
required by the relevant industrial instrument,
Construction Industry Award - State
The amount of the
short-payment was particularised as 9% of ordinary-time earnings of $23,656.18,
$2,129.06. The matter came before an Industrial Magistrate at
Maroochydore on 24 June 2009. There was no appearance for the defendant.
complainant was granted leave to proceed
pursuant to s. 142A of
Justices Act 1886.
In the result, the Industrial Magistrate: (a)
convicted the defendant and recorded a conviction; (b) imposed a fine of $400
and ordered
the defendant to pay costs of court in the sum of $74.40; and (c)
ordered the defendant to pay the amount of $2,129.06 to the employee
Cameron Cross. An order was made for notice to be given to the State Penalties
Enforcement Registry in order that payment of
the sums ordered to be paid might
be enforced. This Appeal goes to the quantum of the fine and to the orders made
amount of superannuation contributions.
quantum of the fine is said to be manifestly inadequate. I suspect that that
submission is correct. This Court has previously
given its view of the gravity
of the failure to pay award wages, see
McGurren v Gibbins
(2005) 179 QGIG
Whitson v Haylsdan Pty Ltd and Velu Pty Ltd
[2006] QIC 38
In my view, the same considerations apply to a failure to comply with
an industrial instrument by failing to pay superannuation
contributions at the
appropriate level. There is the additional difficulty that the Industrial
Magistrate nominated the sum of $400
as the appropriate quantum on the explicit
basis that, if instead of instituting proceedings in the Industrial Magistrates
for breach of s. 406 of the
Industrial Relations Act 1999
the complainant had chosen to issue an infringement notice under the
Penalties Enforcement Act 1999
, the maximum penalty would have been $400.
The difficulty is that the Industrial Magistrate was placed in an impossible
The Industrial Magistrate was aware that Mr Golinski had not
appeared. The Industrial Magistrate was informed by the complainant
Golinski had declined to be interviewed. The Industrial Magistrate must
inevitably have concluded that the significant mitigating
circumstances of a
prompt plea of guilty, co-operation with the investigating authorities and
remorse were not present. However,
the Industrial Magistrate was not given
information which enabled His Honour to form a view about the objective gravity
of the offence.
Certainly, the particulars disclosed a failure over a period of
time. However, if the offence had its origins not in wilful industrial
misconduct but in neglect and/or ignorance, one would expect repetition of the
underpayment. At one point, His Honour sought advice
question was not answered. On the Appeal, this Court has been taken to its own
decisions. The decisions
are too few in number to give guidance and in any
event, the shortage of facts makes comparison impossible. Further, when the
Magistrate asked for advice about comparators he was taken directly
to the maximum fine which might have been levied by an infringement
notice under
State Penalties Enforcement Act 1999
. I can well understand why the
Industrial Magistrate chose not to speculate about the appropriate quantum of
the fine and took the
crutch offered by the complainant of drawing a figure from
Schedule 5 to the
State Penalties Enforcement Regulation 2000.
Consistently with the decision in
Whitson v Haylsdan Pty Ltd and Velu Pty Ltd
[2006] QIC 38
(2006) 182 QGIG 201
, I dismiss the appeal against the quantum of the fine.
Whether the modest fine and the recording of a conviction are compatible
decisions may be considered if Mr Golinski appeals.
The orders made about
the outstanding superannuation contributions pose somewhat difficult problems.
I accept the submission that
State Penalties Enforcement Act 1999
does not provide for the recovery of sums ordered to be paid pursuant to s. 406
Industrial Relations Act 1999
(the Act). The
State Penalties
Enforcement Act 1999
is limited to the collection and enforcement of court
ordered fines, infringement notice penalties and fees, compensation and
restitution,
and amounts forfeited under undertakings and recognisances. Like
unpaid wages (see
Palk v Kneeves
(2007) 186 QGIG 700
superannuation contributions do not answer that description. Whether the
Industrial Magistrate had power to order the payment
of the outstanding
superannuation contributions to Mr Cross is a more perplexing problem. As a
matter of first impression, such
an order is lawful. Section 406(5) of the Act
authorises an Industrial Magistrate who finds an employer guilty of an offence
failing to make superannuation contributions at the appropriate level to make
any order which an Industrial Magistrate might make
if civil proceedings were
instituted for the recovery of such superannuation contributions. By s. 408(4)
of the Act, in such a civil
proceeding, the Industrial Magistrate "must order
the employer to pay to the employee" any amount of superannuation contributions
found not to have been paid. On its face, the language is intractable. The
difficulty is that s. 408(6) of the Act restricts an
Industrial Magistrate's
power to make an order about the payment of the unpaid amount to orders that the
Queensland Industrial Relations
Commission might have made if the civil
proceedings had been instituted under s. 278(9) or (10). A limited and
irrelevant exception
apart, s. 278(9) and (10) requires the Commission to order
that the amount be paid to the appropriate superannuation fund (here Sunsuper).
I do not think that the conundrum is to be resolved by asserting where there is
internal inconsistency in a statute the latter provision
prevails. It seems to
me to be tolerably clear that s. 408 contemplates that the way in which
outstanding superannuation contributions
will be paid to an employee will be by
paying the money to the appropriate superannuation fund. It is an extraordinary
leap to conclude
that the consequence of the underpayment of superannuation
contributions is that the contributions transmogrify into wages to be
immediately to the employee and taxed as ordinary earnings.
One further
matter requires consideration. Though the Industrial Magistrate chose not to
act upon the submission, it was submitted
to the Industrial Magistrate that
enforcement of the order about the payment of superannuation contributions might
be secured by
the exercise of the power at s. 161 of the
Justices Act 1886.
On the appeal, that submission was abandoned on the basis that the
Queensland Industrial Relations Commission could not make such
Arguably, there is difference between orders about the payment of outstanding
superannuation contributions and further
and additional orders designed to
secure the enforcement of the order to pay. This is not an appropriate case in
which to resolve
the matter. The complainant is content to seek an order which
may be enforced in civil proceedings. That course seems to me to
be entirely
appropriate. The form of such an order is a matter of some difficulty. Section
278(9) of the Act suggests that an order
requiring the unpaid contributions be
paid to the (correct) superannuation fund is appropriate. It may be doubted
whether any person
other than the superannuation fund might institute an action
of debt (s. 336(2) of the Act) to recover the money. Not dissimilar
arise under s. 400(2) of the Act.
In these circumstances, I set aside
the orders of the Industrial Magistrate about the unpaid superannuation
contributions and in lieu
thereof, I order Shane Randall Golinski to pay
$2,129.06 to Sunsuper by way of superannuation contributions for Joel Cameron
