MENTAL HEALTH LAWS FOR THOSE ‘COMPLIANT’ WITH
The focus of current mental health laws is on the involuntary detention
and treatment of those with low-prevalence, serious mental
illnesses such as
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, an international trend is
developing towards using mental health laws
to safeguard the rights of patients
who lack the capacity to consent to treatment but who are not objecting to it.
This paper analyses
the legislative response in England and Wales to a decision
by the European Court of Human Rights indicating that there should be
legislative procedures for those lacking capacity to consent to consent, but who
are ‘compliant’ with treatment.
INTRODUCTION
In 2007, a National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing conducted by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics indicated that only 35%
of individuals with a
mental disorder of 12 months in duration received any
In 2008, the
Victorian Government Department of Human Services admitted that “current
arrangements and service cultures mean
that individuals with mental health
problems receive inadequate services compared to those with physical health
conditions”
the situation is much the same across Australia.
The Victorian Government Department of Human Services also stated that
“services are too focused on the most severely mentally
can be said of mental health laws which focus on the
involuntary
detention and treatment of those considered incapable of consenting to or
refusing treatment because of the nature of their illness.
Only relatively
recently has there been an exploration as to whether mental health laws can
assist those with mental illnesses who
want to be treated (sometimes referred to
as voluntary patients) or those who are unable to consent but are
“compliant”
with the treatment offered.
This column explores recent laws enacted in England and Wales that govern the
detention and treatment of a group of patients who can
be classified as not
truly voluntary, but are “compliant” either because of cognitive
impairments or because of a lack
of understanding of their rights, because of
the fear of being given involuntary status or because of the pressure of others.
outlining the new laws, it is necessary to consider the events leading up
to their enactment.
HL V UNITED KINGDOM (THE BOURNEWOOD CASE)
The lack of legislative procedures for those lacking capacity to consent but
compliant with treatment was considered by the European
Court of Human Rights in
HL v United Kingdom
(2005) 40 EHRR 32;
[2004] 9 ECHR 191
HL was born in
1949 and has suffered autism since birth. He has a long history of behavioural
problems and special care needs. He
is unable to speak and his cognitive
abilities are such that he lacks the capacity to consent or object to medical
treatment. For
over 30 years he was cared for in the Bournewood Hospital, being
an inpatient in the Intensive Behavioural Unit since the late 1980s.
In March 1994, HL lived with two paid carers, Mr and Mrs E, while the
hospital remained responsible for his care and treatment. From
1995 onwards, HL
attended a day-care centre on a weekly basis.
On 22 July 1997, while HL was at the day-care centre, he became agitated and
started banging his head against the wall. He was taken
to the accident and
emergency unit at the hospital and was admitted as an inpatient. A doctor
considered making him an involuntary
patient, but decided not to because he was
compliant and did not resist being admitted. It was not until 12 December 1997
was released back into Mr and Mrs E’s care.
In the meantime, around September 1997, HL, represented by his cousin and
“next friend”, made an application for judicial
review of the
hospital’s decision to admit him, for a writ of habeas corpus and for
damages for false imprisonment. The High
Court refused the application on the
grounds that HL had been properly admitted under the common law principle of
On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that HL’s detention had been
This was on
the basis that the right to detain a patient for treatment for mental disorder
could only be made under the
Mental Health Act 1983
(England and Wales).

Commission estimated that if this judgment were to be put
into practice and applied to others in similar circumstances to those of
“there would be an additional 22,000 detained patients resident on any one
day and an additional 48,000 compulsory admissions
per year under the 1983
The Hospital Trust appealed to the House of Lords which upheld the appeal in
R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust; Ex parte L
(with whom Lords Lloyd and Hope agreed) delivered the principal judgment and
held that patients who were compliant, but
lacked capacity to consent, could be
treated on the basis of the common law doctrine of necessity and did not have to
be detained
as involuntary patients under the
Mental Health Act 1983
(England and Wales). The drawback to this approach, as Lord Steyn observed
(at 492-493), was that individuals like HL would not have
their detention
subject to an extensive scheme of statutory safeguards.
An application was then made to the European Court of Human Rights. It found
that HL’s detention had breached Art 5(1) of the
European Convention on
Human Rights
which states that “everyone has the right to liberty and
security of the person”. One of the exceptions is the “lawful
detention” of “persons of unsound
or not a person is of unsound mind must be determined by objective medical
HL v United Kingdom
(2005) 40 EHRR 32;
[2004] 9 ECHR 191
European Court of Human Rights found that HL had been deprived of his liberty
because he had been under continuous supervision
and had not been free to leave
(at [91]). Further, he was of unsound mind in that he was “suffering from
a mental disorder
of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement which
persisted during his detention between 22 July and 5 December 1997”
[101]). Ultimately, the main issue was whether or not HL’s detention could
be considered “lawful” in the sense
of avoiding
“arbitrariness” (at [119]). The court found that the detention was
not lawful in this sense because of the
lack of any fixed procedural rules
governing HL’s detention, particularly the lack of any requirement for the
clinical assessment
of the continuation of the disorder warranting detention (at
[120]). The court did not order monetary compensation for the detention,
order that HL’s costs be paid by the state.
The effect of this decision was to reinforce that “informal”
admission procedures were not appropriate for those individuals
who lack the
capacity to consent to treatment, but who are compliant with it. This mirrors
the approach taken by the majority of
the Supreme Court of the United States in
Zinermon v Burch
(1990) in which procedural safeguards were
deemed necessary for voluntarily admitting an individual who lacked the capacity
informed consent. The court in that case, however, did not specify what
those procedural safeguards should be.
In March 2005, the government released a Consultation Document setting out
its proposed response to the European Court’s

legislation governing admission procedures, as well
as processes for review and
appeals. A summary of responses was then circulated by the Department of
Subsequently, Sch A1 was added to the
Mental Capacity Act
(England and Wales) by Sch 7 of the
Mental Health Act 2007
(England and
Wales). This schedule sets out a new system relating to certain individuals
detained in hospitals and care homes for
treatment purposes which came into
force on 1 April 2009. The following section outlines some of the features of
this scheme.
THE SCHEME IN ENGLAND AND WALES
The stated policy objective of the new scheme is to “provide legal
protection for those vulnerable people who are deprived of
their liberty
otherwise than under the
Mental Health Act 1983
, to prevent arbitrary
decisions to deprive a person of liberty and to give rights to challenge
deprivation of liberty
authorisations”.
The scheme relates to people in hospitals and care homes aged 18 and over who
suffer from a mental disorder, lack capacity to decide
whether or not they
should be resident in a hospital or care home, and for whom the deprivation of
liberty (within the meaning of
Art 5(1) of the
European Convention on Human
) is considered necessary in their best interests to protect them from
The assessment process
Whenever a hospital or care home identifies a person who lacks capacity and
who is, or is likely to be, deprived of her or his liberty,
it must request
authorisation to detain that person from the supervisory body (for hospitals
this is the primary care trust, and
for care homes it is the local
authority).
Once a supervisory body receives a request for authorisation, it must arrange
for six different assessments to be undertaken in order
to establish whether or
not the person meets the requirements so that a standard deprivation of liberty
authorisation can be issued.
The six assessments
: The person being deprived of liberty must be 18 or

: The person must suffer from a mental disorder within the meaning

: The person must lack capacity in relation to the
question whether or not he or she should be accommodated in the relevant
or care home for the purpose of being given the relevant care or

Any deprivation of liberty must be in the best
interests of the person, necessary to prevent her or him from coming to harm,

A person is eligible unless he or she is: detained under the

that conflicts with the authorisation sought (eg, a
guardianship order requiring her or him to live somewhere else), or subject to
powers of recall under the
Mental Health Act
Alternatively, he or she will be ineligible if “the application is to
enable mental health treatment in hospital and [he or
she objects] to being in
hospital or to the treatment in question. In deciding whether a person objects,

values should be considered where

If, however, all the assessments are positive, the supervisory body must
issue a standard deprivation of liberty
authorisation.
Department of Health has stated that the “duration of any authorisation
will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking
account of the
individual’s
circumstances”.
The maximum period for an authorisation is 12 months, but the deprivation of
liberty should only last for as long as necessary, as
determined by the best

information:

that the hospital or care home managers, the person concerned, any IMCA

The consequences of the new scheme
The significance of the new scheme is evidenced by the number of people who
could be affected. The Department of Health estimates
that there are nearly
500,000 people in England and Wales who have a mental disorder and who lack
Department posits that around 50,000 of those people require additional
restrictions for their protection, such as preventing
them from leaving their
hospital or care home, which could amount to a deprivation of
government estimates that in the first year of operation 21,000 people will be
assessed and about 5,250 authorisations
forecasts, however, that the number will drop to around 5,000 assessments and
1,250 authorisations by 2015 as hospitals and care
is meant by the deprivation of liberty and how to avoid
The system will also be very time-intensive. Each person who goes through a
standard authorisation will require on average two hours
of a consultant
psychiatrist’s time, eight hours of a best interests assessor’s
time, three hours of a senior manager
in a supervisory body’s time, two
hours of a senior manager in a hospital or care home’s time, and eight
hours of an
IMCA’s time where necessary (probably 15% of
total of at least 10 hours of assessment for persons who may be detained, but
for many, it will amount to more than 18
The need for legislative provisions governing the detention of those who are
not “truly” voluntary patients, but “compliant”
seem to be of the utmost importance following the decision of the European Court
of Human Rights, but many Mental Health Acts
still focus solely on involuntary
admission and treatment. Guardianship and disability laws may go some way
towards providing procedural
safeguards for some of the members of this group,
but in Australia, for those with mental illnesses, only the
Mental Health and
Related Services Act
(NT) contemplates the voluntary admission and treatment
of those who are unable to give their informed consent. The provisions in
Act assume that a guardian has been appointed under the
Adult Guardianship
(NT) to make a decision on behalf of such an
individual.
It is therefore timely to consider whether laws should be introduced in
Australia to ensure proper procedural safeguards for those
who lack the capacity
to consent to treatment but are “compliant”. Whether the scheme set
up in England and Wales should
be emulated, given the complexities of the
assessment process, needs further exploration. It will be interesting to observe
scheme operates in practice and whether any review of it recommends
