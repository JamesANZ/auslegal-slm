Water Management Act 2000
29 November 2024, Water NSW issued its General Terms of Approval (GTAs) pursuant
Water Management Act
in relation to the original form of the
proposed development. The parties advise that in accordance with s 4.47 of the
EPA Act, the
agreed conditions of consent include the requirement to comply with
the recommendations in Water NSW’s GTAs (at Conditions
Wollongong Local Environmental Plan 2009
LEP is the relevant local environmental planning instrument that applies to the
site. Under cl 2.1 of the LEP, the site is zoned
E2 Commercial Centre. The
proposed development is permissible with consent in the E2 zone pursuant to
cll 2.2 and 2.3 of the LEP.
I am satisfied that the proposed development is
consistent with the objectives for development within the zone in which the
development
is proposed to be carried out.
2.7 of the LEP relates to demolition. The amended DA seeks consent for
demolition of existing structures on the site.
Clause 4.3 –
Height of Buildings
4.3 of the LEP relates to HoB development standards. The parties advise that the
site is subject to varying building height
limits under cl 4.3 of the LEP, and
provided the following summary of the proposed development’s compliance
with the HoB development
standards in the LEP:
(1) Part of Building A will have a maximum height of 47.7 metres (m) and
complies with a maximum height of 48m;
(2) Part of Building A will have a maximum height of 23.8m and complies with the
maximum height of 24m;
(3) Building B will have a maximum height of 23.7m and complies with the maximum
height of 24m;
(4) Building C will have a maximum height of 23.9m and complies with the maximum
height of 24m;
(5) Building D will have a maximum height of 23.8m and complies with the maximum
height of 24m; and
(6) Building E will have a maximum height of 25.57m and does not comply with the
maximum height of 24m.
stated in par [7] above, a clause 4.6 variation request has been provided in
relation to the proposed height of Building E and
is discussed below at pars
4.4 of the LEP refers to the floor space ratio (FSR) for the site, which is
identified on the FSR map in the LEP as a maximum
of 1.5:1. However, the parties
advise that as the site is zoned E2 under the LEP and located in within the
Wollongong City Centre,
cl 4.4A of the LEP applies to the site.
particular, the parties confirm that cl 4.4A(4) applies to the proposed
development which is on land zoned E2 and is proposed to
be used for shop top
housing development comprising of commercial, retail and residential tenancies.
Clause 4.4A(4) of the LEP provides
a formula to calculate the maximum FSR for a
building on land within Zone E1 Local Centre, Zone E2 Commercial Centre, Zone E3
Productivity
Support or Zone MU1 Mixed Use, that is to be used for a mixture of
residential purposes and other purposes.
parties submit that the amended Statement of Environmental Effects submitted
with the amended DA concludes the proposed development
is subject to a maximum
FSR of 3.76:1. The proposed development has an FSR of 2.899:1. Accordingly, the
parties advise that the amended
DA complies with cl 4.4A of the
Clause 4.6 Variation – Height of Buildings
4.6 of the LEP relates to exceptions to development standards and provides the
consent authority must be satisfied that the
Applicant has demonstrated
compliance with the development standard is unreasonable or unnecessary in the
circumstances and there
are sufficient environmental planning grounds to justify
the contravention of the development standard.
noted at [7] above, the Applicant has submitted a cl 4.6 HoB written request
prepared by Architectus dated 24 June 2025 to vary
the application of cl 4.3 of
the LEP in relation the non-compliant height of Building E.
parties advise that:
(1) Building E has a maximum height of 25.574m (RL32.4m) to the highest point of
the sawtooth room form, and 25.402m (RL32.8m) to
the lift overrun, from existing
ground level;
(2) This represents a variation to the 24m HoB development standard by 1.402m
(5.84%) to the top of the primary roof form, and 1.574m
(6.56%) to the top of
lift overrun, from existing ground level;
(3) The proposed variation is attributed to a requirement to increase site
levels along the eastern edge of the site, within the
proposed shared zone, to
facilitate a future through site connection between Burelli Street and Stewart
Street. This raising of site
levels lifts Building E and results in a minor
exceedance to the height of building control to the southern portion of the roof
for Building E;
(4) The proposed variation will not result in any unreasonable amenity outcomes
relating to built form or scale, views, solar access,
to surrounding properties or within the locality; and
(5) The built form, bulk and scale is considered suitable for the site and the
proposal is otherwise consistent with the planning
framework and in accordance
with the objectives of the HoB development standard and the E2 Commercial Centre
zone, and will deliver
a new, high-quality development consistent with the
zoning intent of the site.
am satisfied that the Applicant’s cl 4.6 HoB written request is well
founded and that the variation to the maximum HoB development
standard is
acceptable.
consider that compliance with the HoB development standard is unreasonable or
unnecessary, as required under cl 4.6(3)(a) of the
LEP because the proposed
development achieves the objectives of the HoB development standard,
notwithstanding the HoB exceedance
for the reasons provided within the
Applicant’s cl 4.6 HoB written request, which I adopt;
am also satisfied that there are sufficient environmental planning grounds to
justify contravening the HoB development standard,
as required under cl
4.6(3)(b) of the LEP, for the following reasons as stated in the cl 4.6 HoB
written request:
(1) The proposed variation to Building E will facilitate the delivery of the
shared zone at the site, which subject to the development
of the adjoining
property, will enable a future mid-block through site connection between Stewart
Street and Burelli Street;
(2) The proposed variation to Building E does not reflect the maximum building
height permitted and proposed across the site;
(3) The proposed sawtooth roof profile reduces the volumetric extent of the
variation, compared to a flat roof form;
(4) The proposed variation is attributed to the increase in site levels within
the shared zone only and does not result in any additional
floorspace;
(5) The proposed variation does not result in any view loss, nor amenity impacts
to surrounding properties; and
(6) The proposed development will not give rise to adverse overshadowing of
neighbouring or nearby properties or MacCabe Park.
of the proposed development will be in the public interest for the reasons
provided above (at par [
]), and because the proposed development is consistent
with the objectives for the HoB development standard and for development within
the E2 Commercial Centre zoning of the subject site for the reasons provided
within the Applicant’s cl 4.6 HoB written request,
which I also
Clause 4.6 Variation – Building Separation
noted above at [7], the Applicant has also submitted a cl 4.6 variation request
prepared by Architectus dated 24 June 2025 to vary
cl 8.6 relating to building
separation within Zone E2 Commercial Centre (cl 8.6 of the LEP is discussed at
pars [58] – [60]
below). A summary table of the non-compliance for
Buildings A to E is provided in Section 3 ‘Extent of Variation to the
Development
Standard’ in the amended cl 4.6 BS written request.
parties advise that:
(1) They agree that there are inconsistences between cl 8.6 of the LEP and the
NSW Apartment Design Guide (ADG), and the building
separation proposed is
generally compliant with the building separation controls contained in Part 3F
of the ADG;
(2) Compliance with cl 8.6 of the LEP could be achieved by merging the proposed
towers into fewer, larger towers. However, breaking
the built form into more
slender towers is considered by the parties to be a superior development
outcome, both in terms of visual
appearance and residential amenity;
(3) The proposed built form complies with the provisions of Chapter D13 Section
6.12 and 6.13 of the Wollongong Development Control
Plan 2009 (the DCP) that
uphold visual and acoustic privacy;
(4) The proposed development complies with the solar access objectives of the
(5) The Court can be satisfied that the Applicant has demonstrated that
compliance with the development standard is unreasonable
or unnecessary in the
circumstances and there are sufficient environmental planning grounds to justify
the contravention of cl 8.6
building separation in the LEP.
am satisfied that the Applicant’s amended cl 4.6 BS written request is
well founded and that the variation to the building
separation development
standard is acceptable.
consider that compliance with the building separation development standard is
unreasonable or unnecessary, as required under cl
4.6(3)(a) of the LEP because
the proposed development achieves the objectives of the building separation
development standard, notwithstanding
non-compliance with the building
separation requirements in cl 8.6 of the LEP for the reasons provided within the
Applicant’s
amended cl 4.6 BS written request, which I adopt;
am also satisfied that there are sufficient environmental planning grounds to
justify contravening the building separation development
standard, as required
under cl 4.6(3)(b) of LEP, for the following reasons as stated in the
amended cl 4.6 BS written request:
(1) The development will not give rise to adverse overshadowing of neighbouring
or nearby properties or MacCabe Park;
(2) The provision of five separate buildings will allow more opportunities for
residential units facing north, east and west that
could not be achieved with
residential buildings with inefficient floorplates; and
(3) The proposed development complies with the ADG which is a more contemporary
and widely-held industry standard, adopted in the
of the proposed development will be in the public interest for the reasons
provided above (at [
]), and because the proposed development is consistent
with the objectives for the building separation development standard and for
development within the E2 Commercial Centre zoning of the subject site for the
reasons provided within the Applicant’s amended
cl 4.6 BS written request,
which I also adopt.
