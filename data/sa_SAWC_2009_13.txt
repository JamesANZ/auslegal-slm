JAMES FOWLER, RICHARD GORDON TEUSNER, JON BENNETT ALTON v MAXIMUS RESOURCES LTD
[2009] SAWC
Judgment of
Senior Warden Cannon
Exempt Land; Objection to Entry; Conditions and Compensation
JAMES FOWLER, RICHARD GORDON TEUSNER, JON BENNETT ALTON v MAXIMUS RESOURCES LTD
[2009] SAWC
The nature of this application is set out in the letter from DMAW
Lawyers of 2 Oct 2008. What Maximus would want me to do is to change
1 to have a new drilling period commencing some time in January next year and to
seek to clarify the other obligations
set out in that letter.
changing of the drilling period to a completely new six month period in my view
takes it outside the ruling I have already given
and Maximus will have to
reapply as a fresh application. I would be sympathetic to the view that any
such fresh application would
not require a complete rehearing of all the
evidence but of course I will have to hear the parties on that if and when a
fresh application
I reserve 12 November 2008 as a date for
possible hearing if a fresh application is made.
