claimant was injured in a motor vehicle accident on 1 June 2020.
claimant was referred for an MRI of their cervical spine.
12 June 2020, MRI Now provided to the insurer an imaging referral requesting
approval of the MRI procedure in accordance with the
applicable rates set out in
the current Australian Medical Association List of Medical Services and Fees
(‘AMA List Rate’).
25 June 2020, the insurer approved the MRI imaging request at a rate of $700.00
for one region of the body and an additional $100.00
if contrast was
25 June 2020, MRI Now advised the insurer that an appointment had been arranged
for the claimant to undergo an MRI on 29 June 2020.
1 July 2020, MRI Now issued the insurer with an invoice in the amount of
$1,705.00 for the MRI scan.
insurer paid to MRI Now the sum of $700.00 in accordance with their approval
letter dated 25 June 2020.
29 September 2020, MRI Now issued an invoice in the amount of $1,005.00, being
the outstanding amount after receipt of the insurer’s
payment in the
amount of $700.00. The Insurer subsequently declined payment of the outstanding
9 October 2020, the claimant, through their legal representative, requested an
internal review of the insurer’s decision
to decline payment of the
further invoice.

original decision to decline payment of the MRI Now
invoice in the amount of
21 October 2020, the claimant applied for a merit review by the Dispute
Resolution Service.
Documents and Information
have considered the documents provided in the Application and the
Submissions
The claimant submits that:
up to the Insurer to prove that the MRI cost claimed is unreasonable. The
Insurer has not referred to any evidence, guidelines
or gazette which stipulates
or fixes the cost of an MRI scan at $700.00.
only Authority that fixes the recommended MRI cost is the AMA List Rate. The AMA
List Rate provides that the fee charged by MRI
Now is the correct
8.9 of the Act and Regulation 34 of the
Motor Accident Injuries Regulation
(‘the Regulation’) confirms the proposition that the MRI
cost ought to be paid in accordance with the AMA List
Now has not charged beyond the AMA List Rate.
part payment of the MRI Now invoice is not in accordance with the objects of the
Act, in particular Section 1.3 of the Act, as this
would result in a gap which
the claimant will have to pay out of their own pocket. Not everyone can afford a
gap payment of up to
$1,000.00. The significant out of pocket costs would
discourage early and appropriate treatment and would not go towards providing
early financial support if a part of the financial support is used to fund
medical treatment.
second reading of the speech of the Act provides that one of the objects of the
Act was that claimants would not be out of pocket.
reply, the insurer relies on its reasons as set out in its internal review
decision dated 21 October 2020 and submits that:
costs requested by MRI Now are not reasonable and necessary in the
circumstances.
to section 3.27(1) of the Act, statutory benefits for expenses are not payable
unless they are verified in accordance with
the Motor Accident Guidelines
(‘The Guidelines’).

reasonable and necessary treatment and care and
rehabilitation.

Legislation
conducting my review, I have considered the following legislation and
guidelines:
Accident Injuries Act
(NSW) (“the Act”)
Accident Guidelines
effective 20 April 2020 (“the
Guidelines”)
Accident Injuries Regulation
(NSW) (“the
Regulation”)
Documentation and information considered
claimant in their DRS application for merit review, has provided a CT cervical
and lumbar spine report. The report shows the claimant
underwent a CT scan on 11
June 2020. The CT report notes a horizontal fracture at the C3-4 level of
indeterminate age. An MRI is
recommended to exclude spinal cord or
myelomalacia.
services of MRI Now were subsequently used to arrange an MRI scan of the
claimant’s cervical spine.
12 June 2020, MRI Now emailed the insurer advising they had received a referral
for the claimant to undergo an MRI of their cervical
spine and requested the
insurer’s approval for the procedure in accordance with the applicable
rates set out in the current
AMA List Rate.
25 June 2020, the Insurer emailed MRI Now determining the MRI request to be both
reasonable and necessary and approved the requested
MRI at $700.00 for one
region of the body and a further $100.00 if contrast was required.
the same day, MRI Now emailed the insurer to confirm an appointment had been
made for the claimant to undergo an MRI of the cervical
spine on 29 June
1 July 2020, MRI Now issued an invoice to the insurer for the sum of
6 July 2020, the insurer paid MRI Now $700.00 in accordance with their approval
letter dated 25 June 2020.
29 September, MRI Now issued an invoice for the outstanding amount of
insurer declined payment of the further invoice amount.
to Section 3.24 of the Act, an injured person is entitled to statutory benefits
for the reasonable cost of treatment and
care. Section 3.24 provides as
3.24 Entitlement to statutory benefits for treatment and care
(1) An injured person is entitled to statutory benefits for the following
expenses ("treatment and care expenses") incurred in connection
with providing
treatment and care for the injured person--
(a) the reasonable cost of treatment and care......
(2) No statutory benefits are payable for the cost of treatment and care to
the extent that the treatment and care concerned was not
reasonable and
necessary in the circumstances or did not relate to the injury resulting from
the motor accident concerned.
is no dispute between the parties that the MRI scan amounts to ‘treatment
and care’ for the purposes of the Act.
is also no dispute between the parties that the MRI scan was ‘reasonable
and necessary’ in the circumstances, or
that the need for an MRI scan
related to injuries arising from the motor vehicle accident. In that regard, I
note the CT scan undertaken
on 29 June 2020, recommends an MRI scan to ascertain
whether the claimant had sustained a cord injury or myelomalacia and the Insurer
subsequently determined that the MRI request was both reasonable and
is therefore no dispute that the claimant is entitled to statutory benefits for
the reasonable cost of the MRI scan.
issues therefore before me are whether the MRI cost is properly verified, and
the amount charged in the sum of $1,705.00 is reasonable
in the circumstances
and therefore recoverable pursuant to section 3.24 of the Act.
insurer submits that no statutory benefits are payable under the Act unless the
expenses are properly verified in accordance with
the Guidelines, although the
insurer does not appear to submit that the MRI Now invoices were not properly
order to recover the reasonable costs of treatment and care, any expenses must
be properly verified. Section 3.27 of the Act provides
3.27 Verification of expenses
(1) No statutory benefits are payable under this Division for expenses unless
the expenses are properly verified in accordance with
the Motor Accident
Guidelines.
(2) The Motor Accident Guidelines may make provision for how expenses for
treatment and care are to be verified including verification
(a) the expenses have been incurred, and
(b) the treatment and care has been provided, and
(c) the treatment and care relate to the injury in respect of which statutory
benefits are payable.
Guidelines provide as follows:
4.103 Where an invoice is issued to the insurer directly from a treatment
or care provider, the following should be included on
the invoice:
4.103.1 the claimant’s first and last name,
4.103.2 the claim number allocated by the insurer,
4.103.3 payee details,
4.103.4 the Medicare provider number, if relevant,
4.103.5 the Australian Business Number (ABN) of the provider,
4.103.6 the name of the medical practitioner or service provider,
4.103.7 the date of the service (the date of invoice must be on the day of
or after last date of service listed on the invoice),
4.103.8 the payment classification code from the Authority or AMA item
number, where applicable,
4.103.9 the service cost for each payment classification code from the
Authority or AMA item number, where applicable, and
4.103.10 the service duration, where applicable.
agree that pursuant to section 3.27(1) of the Act statutory benefits are not
payable unless verified in accordance with the Act.
However, I am satisfied that
MRI Now’s invoices dated 1 July and 29 September 2020 were properly
verified. Both invoices contain
the information as required by section 4.103 of
the Guidelines, where applicable.
to whether the MRI cost of $1,705.00 is reasonable, section 8.9 of the Act
provides as follows:
8.9 Maximum fees payable by insurers for treatment and care not provided
at hospitals or provided at private hospitals
(1) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to fixing the
maximum amount for which an insurer is liable in respect
of any claim for-
(a) the fee payable for any treatment and care of an injured person to the
provider of that treatment and care (other than treatment
and care that is
provided to in-patients or out-patients at a hospital and for which any payment
is required to be made to the hospital
and not to the provider of that treatment
and care) ......
(2) Any such fees may (but need not) be fixed by reference to fees
recommended by the Australian Medical Association or other professional
association or by reference to any schedule of fees.
(3) A payment by an insurer of statutory benefits for treatment and care, or
assessed by the Dispute Resolution Service, is to be
made consistently with any
regulations under this section.
(4) This section does not prevent the inclusion in Motor Accident Guidelines
of provision as to the appropriate allowance for fees
to which this section
applies and which are not fixed by regulations under this section.
Regulation fixes the maximum amount an insurer is liable to pay for treatment
and care by reference to fees recommended by the
Australian Medical Association.
Section 34 of the Regulation provides as follows:
amounts payable by insurer for treatment and care not provided at hospitals or
provided at private hospitals (section 8.9)
(1) The maximum
amount for which an insurer is liable in respect of any claim for fees payable
for treatment and care to which section
8.9 of the Act applies is the amount
listed, in respect of the treatment concerned, in the AMA List...
(2) This clause applies only in relation to
treatment and care:
(a) that is provided to an injured person by a health practitioner, and
(b) in respect of which a fee is specified in the AMA List.
(3) In this clause:
"AMA List" means the document called List of
Medical Services and Fees published by the Australian Medical Association and
November 2017 as amended or replaced, from time to time, by a document
(a) has been published by the Australian Medical Association, as an
amendment to, or replacement of, the AMA List, and
(b) has been recognised by the Authority, by notice published in the
Act permits the Guidelines to also include provisions for limiting the amount of
statutory benefits payable for particular treatment
and care. Section 3.31 of
the Act provides as follows:
3.31 Limits under Guidelines on
statutory benefits for particular treatment and care
(1) The Motor Accident Guidelines may include provision for the following in
connection with statutory benefits payable under this
Division for treatment and
care expenses-
(a) limiting the amount of statutory benefits payable for any particular
treatment and care,
(b) approving particular treatment and care as
appropriate treatment and care in respect of any matter,
(c) limiting attendant care services for which statutory benefits are payable
to services provided by providers of an approved class
or with approved
competencies.
(2) An insurer is not required to pay statutory benefits for treatment and
care expenses under this Division if the treatment and
care does not accord with
the treatment and care approved under the Motor Accident Guidelines for the
matter concerned.
(3) Nothing in this Division prevents an insurer from-
(a) paying treatment and care expenses that the insurer is not required to
pay as statutory benefits under this Division, or
(b) approving further treatment and care for the purposes of any claim.
(4) An injured person is not liable to pay, and a person is not entitled to
recover from an injured person, the cost of treatment
and care provided in
respect of an injury suffered in the motor accident concerned if, and to the
extent that, the cost of treatment
and care exceeds any limit imposed by the
Motor Accident Guidelines in respect of the treatment and care.
4.98 of the Guidelines provide that:
4.98 Limits
on treatment and care expenses
In terms of section
3.31(4) of the Act, the limit is the applicable Australian Medical Association
(AMA) rates at the time the treatment/service
is provided.
Insurer submits that section 8.9(2) of the Act permits it to adopt the WC Fees
Order with respect to the MRI scan fee. The insurer
appears to rely on the
‘Any such fees may (
but need not
) be fixed by reference
to fees recommended by the Australian Medical Association’
agree with the Insurers interpretation of section 8.9(2) of the Act. Section
8.9(3) of the Act requires the payment of
statutory benefits to be made
consistently with any Regulations made under Section 8.9. The Regulation fixes
the maximum amount payable
by reference to the AMA List Rate. Accordingly, the
appropriate fee for the MRI scan is that prescribed by the AMA List.
my request, the claimant’s legal representative provided a copy of the
Australian Medical Association List of Medical Services
and Fees dated 1
November 2019 (‘2019 Fees List’). This Fees List purports to replace
all previous Fee Lists published
by the AMA, including the Medical Services and
Fees dated 1 November 2017. In view of section 34(3) of the Regulation, I accept
the 2019 Fees List was the applicable List Rate as at the date of the MRI
2019 Fees List provides that the maximum fee for an MRI of one region of the
body or two contiguous regions of the body is $1,705.00.
3.2 of the 2019 Fees List provides as follows:
(2) the amounts have
been calculated by the AMA after careful study and investigation of practice
costs and other relevant and material
circumstances as being, in its opinion,
fair and reasonable and appropriate for the services provided.
(3) All members are, of course, and should at all times regard themselves as
being free and indeed duty bound, to make their own judgment
as to what fees
they will charge for any service. Members should satisfy themselves in each
individual case as to a fair and reasonable
fee having regard to their own cost
experience and the particular circumstances of the case and the patient.
Act does not define ‘the reasonable cost of treatment and care’.
However, the rates prescribed in the 2019 Fees List
are stated by the AMA as
being ‘fair and reasonable and appropriate for the services
provided’. Whilst the 2019 List
Rate provides that ‘members are
required to satisfy themselves as to a fair and reasonable fee having regard to
their own cost
experience and the particular circumstances of the case and the
patient’, it is neither my role, nor the Insurers, to determine
challenge whether MRI Now’s fee is reasonable in the circumstances.
to section 3.31 of the Act and section 4.98 of the Guidelines, an injured person
is not liable to pay, and a person is not
entitled to recover the cost of
treatment and care that exceeds any limit imposed by the AMA Fees List. Given
the Act only prohibits
recovery of fees for treatment and care over and above
the AMA List Rate, any fee charged up to that rate would in my view be
reasonable.
am therefore satisfied that the fee charged by MRI Now in the sum of $1,705.00
is reasonable for the service provided.
insurer submits that the claimant has a duty to minimise loss and that it was
not reasonable and necessary for the claimant to
undergo imaging at a rate over
the approval provided by the insurer.
6.5 of the Act provides as follows:
6.5 Duty of claimants to
minimise loss
(1) A claimant has a duty to take all reasonable steps to minimise loss
caused by injury resulting from a motor accident.
(2) This duty of a claimant includes the following duties--
(a) the duty to undergo reasonable and necessary treatment and care and do
all such things as may be reasonable and necessary for
the claimant's
rehabilitation,
(b) the duty to commence or return to work as soon as reasonably
practicable.....
is nothing in the Act which imposes a duty on the claimant to obtain treatment
and care that is reasonably priced. I suspect
that is because an injured person
may not appreciate that such services may be provided at different cost and/or
have access and/or
the ability to travel to alternative providers that might
charge a cheaper rate.
parties agreed that the MRI scan was reasonable and necessary, and the claimant
duly undertook the scan. Accordingly, I am of
the view that the claimant has
taken steps to minimise their loss in accordance with section 6.5 of the
considering my determination of this merit review, I have also considered the
objects of the Act and in particular sections 1.3(2)(a),
1.3 (2)(b), 1.3(2)(g),
1.3(4) and 1.3(5) which provide;
1.3 Objects of Act
(2) .......the objects of this Act are as follows:
(a) to encourage early and appropriate treatment and care to achieve optimum
recovery of persons from injuries sustained in motor
accidents and to maximise
their return to work or other activities.
(b) to provide early and ongoing financial support for persons injured in
motor accidents.
(g) to encourage the early resolution of motor accident claims and the
quick, cost effective and just resolution of disputes.
(4) In the interpretation of a provision of this Act or the regulations, a
construction that would promote the objects of this Act
or the provision is to
be preferred to a construction that would not promote those objects.
(5) In the exercise of a discretion conferred by a provision of this Act or
the regulations, the person exercising the discretion
must do so in the way that
would best promote the objects of this Act or of the provision concerned.
Determination
My determination of the Merit Review is as
reviewable decision is set aside
and the following decision is made in
substitution for the reviewable decision:
cost of the treatment and care provided by MRI Now to the claimant on 29 June
2020 in the amount of $1,705.00 is reasonable for
the purpose of section 3.24
(1) (a) of the Act.
This determination takes effect on 21 October 2020. The insurer is to
pay the outstanding amount of $1,005.00 pursuant to MRI Now’s
#123456 dated 29 September 2020 within 20 days of the date of this
Determination.
