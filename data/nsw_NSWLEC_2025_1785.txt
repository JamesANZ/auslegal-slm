COMMISSIONER
This appeal concerns a development application for the demolition of the
existing dwelling at 1 Ficus Avenue, Avoca Beach, and the
construction of a
two-storey dwelling with a roof terrace. The development application was refused
by the respondent on 28 November
2024. The appeal is lodged pursuant to
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979
(NSW) (EPA Act). In
exercising the functions of the consent authority on the appeal, the Court has
the power to determine the development
application pursuant to ss 4.15 and 4.16
of the EPA Act. The final orders in this appeal, outlined in [
] below, are made as a
result of an agreement between the parties that was reached at a conciliation
conference.
Court was required to arrange a conciliation conference between the parties,
pursuant to
s 34AA(2)(a)
Land and Environment Court Act 1979
(LEC Act). The conciliation conference commenced on 29 October 2025. I presided
over the conciliation conference.
the conciliation conference, an agreement under s 34(3) of the LEC Act was
reached between the parties as to the terms of a decision
in the proceedings
that was acceptable to the parties. The agreement was filed on 30 October 2025,
following the Council’s
approval of an application for an amendment to a
development application pursuant to
Environmental Planning
and Assessment Regulation 2021
(NSW) (EPA Regulation 2021). The amended
development application reduces the screening on the western side of the rear
ground level
veranda, to maintain views across the site for the adjoining
property, and also increases the finished floor levels and improves
landscaping within the eastern setback.
decision agreed upon is for the grant of development consent subject to
conditions of consent pursuant to s 4.16(1) of the EPA
Act. The signed agreement
is supported by an agreed Jurisdictional Statement that sets out the
prerequisites to the exercise of the
power to grant development consent. I have
considered the contents of the Jurisdictional Statement, together with the
documents referred
to therein, the Class 1 Application and its attachments, the
documents that are referred to in Condition 1, and the assessment report
prepared by the Council and dated 28 November 2024. Based on those documents, I
have considered the matters required to be considered
pursuant to s 4.15(1) of
the EPA Act.
the presiding Commissioner, I am satisfied that the decision to grant
development consent to the amended application subject to
conditions of consent
is a decision that the Court could have made in the proper exercise of its
functions, this being the test applied
by s 34(3) of the LEC Act. This test is
concerned with there being no jurisdictional constraints that preclude the
making of orders
in accordance with the decision that the parties have agreed
McMillan v Taylor
(2023) 111 NSWLR 634
[2023] NSWCA 183
, [51]). I formed this state of satisfaction as each of the jurisdictional
preconditions identified by the parties is met, for the
following reasons:
The development
works are for the purposes of a dwelling house, which is a permissible use in
the R2 Low Density Residential zone
in which the site is located, pursuant to
the Central Coast Local Environmental Plan 2022 (CCLEP).
The proposed
development complies with the height development standard that applies pursuant
to cl 4.3 of the CCLEP, and there is
no floor space ratio development standard
that applies to the site.
Clauses 5.21 and
5.22 of the CCLEP, concerning flood planning, apply to the site, and development
consent must not be granted unless
the Court, exercising the functions of the
consent authority, is satisfied of the matters in cl 5.21(2) and cl 5.22(3). The
development
application was accompanied by a report by Horton Coastal
Engineering dated 15 November 2023, and a joint report was also prepared
coastal engineers and filed 24 October 2025. The joint report was accompanied by
a structural report by Northrop dated 22
October 2025. Based on the contents of
those documents, I have considered the matters in cl 5.21(3) of the CCLEP and I
am satisfied
of the matters in cll 5.21(2) and 5.22(3).
The site is
mapped as having Class 5 Acid Sulfate Soils but the works will not
lower the water table. As such, cl 6.1 of the CCLEP
does not require the
preparation of an acid sulfate soils management plan in relation to the proposed
development.
As the site is
currently occupied by an existing dwelling house, I am satisfied that all of the
services required by cl 7.6 of the
CCLEP are available.
Consistent with
the requirements of s 27 of the EPA Regulation 2021, the development application
is accompanied by the BASIX certificate
dated 30 October 2025. Based on the
BASIX certificate, I am satisfied of the requirement in s 2.1(5) of the State
Environmental Planning
Policy (Sustainable Buildings) 2022.
Consideration
has been given as to whether the subject site is contaminated as required by s
4.6 of the State Environmental Planning
Policy (Resilience and Hazards) 2021
(SEPP RH). As the site has a history of use for the purposes of residential
premises, it is
unlikely to be contaminated.
The site is
within the coastal environment area and the coastal use area, pursuant to
the SEPP RH. Based on the report by Horton Coastal
Engineering
dated 15 November 2023 and the joint report and attachments filed on 24 October
2025, I have considered the matters in
ss 2.10(1) and 2.11(1)(a) of
the SEPP RH, and, consistent with ss 2.10(2)(a) and 2.11(1)(b), I
am satisfied that the development
will not have any adverse impacts on the
matters set out in ss 2.10(1) and 2.11(1)(a) of the SEPP RH.
The development
application was notified from 9 to 23 February 2024, and 12 written submissions
were received in response. I have
considered the issues raised in those written
submissions.
reached the state of satisfaction that the decision is one that the Court could
have made in the exercise of its functions,
s 34(3)(a) of the LEC Act requires
me to “dispose of the proceedings in accordance with the decision”.
The LEC Act also
requires me to “set out in writing the terms of the
decision” (s 34(3)(b)).
making the orders to give effect to the agreement between the parties, I was not
required to make, and have not made, any evaluative
judgment on the matters that
were originally in dispute between the parties, or any assessment of the merits
of the development application
against the discretionary matters that arise
pursuant to an assessment under s 4.15 of the EPA Act.
