APC UPDATE | 5 January 2016
More publications join the Press Council
Three more publications have joined the Australian Press Council, adding to
the large number of print and online media outlets that
have committed
themselves to the Council’s standards of ethical journalism and its
mission to advocate for press freedom.
The new members are:
• Schwartz Media, publisher of The Saturday Paper, a weekly newspaper,
and The Monthly magazine;
• The Bushland Shire Telegraph Pty, publisher of a weekly community
newspaper circulating in the Hawkesbury area of NSW in print
and electronic
• emanila Pty Ltd, a group of online-only publications serving
Australia’s Filipino community.
The Chair of the Press Council, Prof David Weisbrot, said the latest members
reflect the breadth and range of the Australian media,
as well as the warm
welcome extended to publications that strive to serve the community by producing
quality material.
“I’m delighted with the diversity of this latest group of new
members,” Prof Weisbrot said. “One is a well-known
highly-respected publisher of long form journalism, another is a small paper
that has been a very important part of its community
for 30 years, and we are
especially pleased to be able to embrace one of Australia’s
increasingly-important multicultural publications.”
“What unites these three publications, and all of the Press
Council’s member publications, is a genuine commitment to
excellence and
social responsibility.”
The Chairman of Schwartz Media, Morry Schwartz, said: “We’re
proud to join the Press Council and to continue to see The
Saturday Paper and
The Monthly make an important contribution to Australian journalism.”
The Publisher of The Bush Telegraph Weekly, Kathie Comb, said she was pleased
that the Press Council welcomed small publications as
members. “We may be
small, but I believe we serve an important need in our community,” she
said. “Small publications
can be every bit as committed to doing good
journalism as the big mainstream players.”
Romeo Cayabyab, Publisher of the emanila websites, said the Press Council
should be applauded for seeking out new members among the
multicultural
“I see this as a clear indication that the Press Council recognises the
importance of the multicultural press in Australia and
the need for these
publications to strive for high standards and independence just like any other
member of the Council.”
The Australian Press Council was established in 1976 and is responsible for
promoting good standards of media practice, community
access to information of
public interest, and freedom of expression through the media. Press Council
membership encompasses most
of the major newspaper and magazine publishers in
Australia, accounting for some 850 mastheads and 95 per cent of circulation
