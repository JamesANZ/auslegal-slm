APPLICATION FOR REVIEW OF BARRING ORDER
This is an application by Andrew Cooper for a review of barring for three
months from 10 December 2007, allegedly arising from an
incident that occurred
on the licensed premises on 6 December 2007. It is alleged that on that
occasion, Mr Cooper “was part
of an intoxicated group causing offensive
(sic) towards and harassing staff. He served alcohol to this group while
intoxicated himself....”
There is also evidence, on both the Barring Order
and its application for review, of a dispute between Mr Cooper and Stuart
both at the time directors of the licensee company, Where Pty Ltd, Mr
Gifford having signed the Barring Order.
Today’s hearing, with the agreement of the parties, proceeded on a
preliminary point in relation to the validity of the Barring
Consequently, I make no findings about the subject matter of the barring, or its
justification.
Counsel for the barred person, Andrew Cooper, Paul D’Angelo submitted
that this barring is ultra vires, that a director of a
licensee company does not
have the authority to bar another director under section 125 of the Act. I note
that, although Mr Cooper
is no longer a director, he was at the time of the
Mr D’Angelo submits that section 125 does not confer upon an authorised
person under that section, the licensee or a responsible
person, the right to
bar a person also in that category, being available only to bar patrons guilty
of prescribed behaviour.
Mr Gifford submitted that Mr Cooper was barred as a patron of the premises,
due to behavioural issues, including alleged intoxication,
upsetting staff,
“creating a scene”. Mr Gifford points to his duty of care towards
staff, the issue of workplace bullying
and submits that he was obliged to bar Mr
Cooper, his statutory responsibility in the circumstances. In response, Mr
submitted that this is not an issue of whether or not a barring
order could have been made, but rather, does the issue of a barring
these circumstances contravene the intention of the Act, that although Mr
Gifford claims the barring was issued to Mr Cooper
in his capacity as a patron,
he is in fact always clothed in the mantle of a director, whether as a patron or
In summary, Mr Gifford submits that Mr Cooper has not shown that the barring
action could not be taken.
Section 125 of the Act allows a licensee or a responsible person to bar a
person from entering or remaining on the premises.....as
a result of particular
The barring provisions of the Act are therefore a management tool, to enable
a licensee or responsible person to maintain a standard
of behaviour on licensed
premises that protects the safety of other patrons and staff and, in some
circumstances, the barred person,
from the folly his or her own behaviour.
I find that section 125 allows for the barring of
including a member of the licensee’s management, for the following
the reference to
“a person” under section 125 is not restricted in its application to
patrons or other members of the
public without the inclusion of an express
exception to exempt management from its ambit.
purpose of section 125 to allow management to promote the safety and welfare of
patrons and staff, there is no reason why
they should not be protected from
problem behaviour whether by management, patrons or the general public.
There is nothing
express or implied in section 125 to prevent one director from barring
If this matter proceeds, the issue of the appropriate use of
barring where there is a dispute between members of a licensee’s
management will need to be examined, as will the allegations relating to the
alleged incident on 6 December 2007.
However, I find that the barring falls within the scope of section 125 of the
