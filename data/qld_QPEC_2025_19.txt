SOLICITORS:
P&E Law, solicitors for the Appellant
King & Company, solicitors for the Respondent
appellant developer appeals against the respondent Council’s decision to
refuse his development application seeking
a development permit for
reconfiguring a lot (one lot into four lots) for Agricultural Land Class A land
with an area of 53.53 hectares
at 291 Mowbray River Road, Mowbray, in the State
of Queensland, and described as Lot 34 on SP 331786.
appellant contends that the proposed development complies with the Rural Zone
Code and Reconfiguration of a Lot Code, asserting
that no mandatory minimum lot
size exists, and the proposal will not impact the productive capacity of rural
land for primary production
or compromise its long-term rural use. He argues
that the proposal avoids impermissible fragmentation of rural or agricultural
because it is already naturally fragmented, and, if any, further
fragmentation is minor and does not justify refusal; the proposal
creates three
additional rural lots, aligning with the existing rural residential pattern on
the southern side, respects natural
features like watercourses and vegetation,
and accounts for constraints on certain rural uses; most of the land is
preserved for
broad-acre primary production in proposed lot 1, such as sugar
cane cultivation, with infrastructure and two access points to Mowbray
Road; and it includes the existing dwelling, a large farm machinery shed, and
areas suitable for broad-acre production and
small-scale rural activities like
horse keeping and horticulture. It is asserted that proposed lots 2, 3, and 4
support smaller-scale
rural uses and activities, that proposed lot 4 will have
the second existing dwelling near existing residential development, and
are sized for their intended use without compromising existing activities. The
appellant argues that the proposal as a
whole maintains the land’s
capacity for all intended rural uses and may enhance opportunities for
additional realistic rural
uses. Reverse amenity impacts can be addressed
through conditions like building envelopes and boundary buffers for proposed
2, 3, and 4.
[3] The Council
defends its refusal, maintaining that the proposal does not comply with the
Rural Zone Code or Reconfiguration of
a Lot Code as it impermissibly fragments
good quality agricultural land, is inconsistent with the forward planning
strategy, fails
to conserve areas for primary production, and cannot achieve
compliance through conditions. It asserts the land remains suitable
broad-scale primary production now and in the future, having regard to its soil
quality, topography and size, and should be protected
from fragmentation. The
application is seen as an opportunistic attempt to subdivide valuable
agricultural land, a finite resource,
with the Mossman Mill closure and Mossman
Transition Plan underscoring the need for preservation. The Council argues the
appellant’s
experts underestimated the land’s agricultural potential
by focusing on commercial and economic factors rather than its capacity
cropping, grazing, and horticulture.
[4] The critical
questions for determination in the appeal are:
the proposed development comply with the assessment benchmarks in the planning
compliance with the assessment benchmarks be achieved by the imposition of
lawful development conditions?
the development application be approved in the exercise of the discretion under
Planning Act 2016
reviewing evidence assisted with a site view and submissions, I have answered
each question in the negative. I find that
the land remains suitable for rural
uses intended in the Rural Zone, including large-scale cropping, animal
husbandry, and broadacre
primary production, due to its size, topography, and
soil quality. This area currently available for primary production will not
conserved by the proposal, but, instead, it will be further fragmented,
incongruous with the natural constraints of Seasonal Creek,
vegetation and its
topography.
[6] The proposed
development does not comply with the planning scheme’s benchmarks. It
fails to meet the purpose, including
the incorporated Strategic Framework
provisions, and overall outcome 6.2.10.2(3)(a) of the Rural Zone Code, as it
further fragments
the area for use for primary production, being good quality
agricultural land, including it current and potential capacity for larger-scale
rural uses like cropping, animal husbandry, and broadacre primary production.
While the proposal seeks to create opportunities for
some small-scale rural uses
and hobby activities with proposed lots 2, 3 & 4, it does so at the expense
of protecting and maintaining
the land’s intended rural capacity.
Proposed lots 2, 3, and 4 fronting Mowbray River Road would be akin to rural
residential
development. In conflict with overall outcome 6.2.10.2(3)(c), the
creation of new lots will adversely impact the rural land use
of each lot, which
is further entrenched by the need to minimise reverse amenity impacts with
building envelopes and boundary buffers.
The proposal cannot satisfy PO7 by
fragmenting the land into lots smaller than 40 hectares, albeit not a minimum,
with no acceptable
outcome given the importance of size for viable rural uses in
the Rural Zone. Similarly, it fails to comply with the Reconfiguration
Code’s purpose 9.4.7.2(2)(b), as the lots lack sufficient area,
dimensions, and shapes for larger-scale rural uses
contrary to the Rural Zone
Code, and therefore cannot satisfy PO1.
assessment, the extent of non-compliance with the assessment benchmarks cannot
be addressed through the imposition of conditions.
Even considering the other
matters urged by the appellant, approval is not warranted in the exercise of
discretion under
Planning Act
, and I have concluded
that the development application should not be approved.
[8] Accordingly,
for these reasons, I affirm the Council’s refusal of the development
application and dismiss the appeal.
[9] The land is
situated at 291 Mowbray River Road in Mowbray, described as Lot 34 on SP331786
and is located about 8 kilometres south
of Port Douglas, via the Captain Cook
[10] The land is
Agricultural Land Class A with an area of 53.53 hectares. It is irregularly
shaped and bounded by the Mowbray River
to the north-west, Spring Creek to the
east, a smaller rural lot (4.5 hectares) to the north-east, and Mowbray River
Road and other
smaller rural lots (respectively 1.3, 4.2, 3.1, and 3.1
hectares), to the south. Both watercourses have significant vegetation along
their edges. A house is located on all but one of the smaller neighbouring
rural lots.
[11] The land is
intersected by Seasonal Creek, a vegetated ephemeral watercourse with an
informal cross-creek crossing to allow movement
between the northern and
southern portions. There are two existing dwelling houses on the land; one
toward the back of that western
portion of the subject land, between the Mowbray
River and Seasonal Creek; and the other a short distance (perhaps 150 metres or
so) from Mowbray River Road to the immediate west of the vegetation lining the
meandering Seasonal Creek. To the west of the meandering
Seasonal Creek, there
is also a small greenhouse that is used for commercial horticulture.
[12] Notwithstanding
the intersecting Seasonal Creek, the land has historically been used for farming
and rural purposes and operated
as a single farming unit, known as the
Mayfield Farm
”, and was one of the original farms in the
Port Douglas region. The larger portion to the north of the Seasonal Creek is
used for broad-acre primary production of sugar cane. The balance of the
land to the south of Seasonal Creek is used for the keeping
of horses, with
paddocks divided by fences and some shelters. A dressage arena has been built
on part of the subject land near the
rear dwelling.
[13] The area of
the subject land comprising proposed lot 1 is currently used for cropping
(sugarcane), animal keeping (by agistment
or otherwise), small cropping,
intensive horticulture and a dwelling house. The area of the subject land
comprising proposed lots
2, 3 and 4 is currently being used for animal keeping
(by agistment or otherwise). The area of the subject land comprising proposed
lot 4 is also being used for the business of Hunt Design within the existing
dwelling house.
surrounding area is a mix of rural, rural residential, and conservation, with
diverse lots, ranging from 1.3 to 65 hectares.
The neighbouring land:
(a) To the north, beyond Mowbray River, is within the Rural Zone and used for a
dwelling house and cropping (sugarcane);
(b) To the south, beyond Mowbray River Road, is within the Rural Residential
Zone and used for rural residential purposes, including
(c) To the east, beyond Spring Creek, is within the Rural Zone and used for
dwelling house, rural activity tourism (small scale)
and cropping (sugarcane);
(d) To the west, is within the Rural Zone and used for rural purposes, including
dwelling houses and horse agistment.
[15] Historically,
sugar cane harvested in the region, including from the subject land itself, has
been transported for crushing to
the Mossman Mill operated by The Far Northern
Milling Pty Ltd, which was established in 2018 by growers based in Mossman and
Atherton Tablelands.
Proposed Development
appellant proposes to reconfigure the land into four lots with proposed lots 2,
3 and 4 having direct frontage to Mowbray
River Road:
(a) Proposed lot 1 comprises 47.53 hectares, including the existing cane north
of Seasonal Creek, grazing land, house and equestrian
(b) Proposed lot 2 comprises 1.7 hectares;
(c) Proposed lot 3 comprises 1.7 hectares; and
(d) Proposed lot 4 comprises 2.6 hectares, including an existing house.
Planning Treatment
[17] The land is
located in the Rural Zone under the
Douglas Shire Planning Scheme
[18] The planning
scheme was initially prepared under the
Sustainable Planning Act
(Qld) but came into effect on 2 January 2018 under
Planning Act
. As a result, it is subject to the transitional
provisions of
Planning Act
, which allows the scheme to
remain in effect even if some of its terms could not be imposed under that
[19] The State
Planning Policy 2017 interactive mapping system mapped State interests over the
site/part of the site, including agricultural
land classification – Class
Part 2.1(1)
of the planning scheme states that the minister has
identified the economic growth – agriculture State interest in State
Policy 2016 is appropriately integrated in the planning scheme.
[20] The Far
North Queensland Regional Plan 2009 – 2031 published in February 2009,
includes the site in the Regional Landscape
and Rural Production Area.
of the planning scheme states “the minister has identified that the
planning scheme appropriately advances the Far North Queensland
Regional Plan
2009 – 2031, as it applies to the planning scheme area”.
[21] According
to the planning scheme, the land is located entirely within the Rural Zone. It
is relevantly affected by the following
(a) Natural Areas Overlay: Matters of State Environmental Significance –
Regulated Vegetation (of concern Regional Ecosystem)
(in part along the Mowbray
River, Spring Creek and Seasonal Creek); and Matters of State Environmental
Significance – Regulated
Vegetation (intersecting a watercourse) (in part
along the Mowbray River, Spring Creek and Seasonal Creek);
(b) Flood & Storm Tide Hazard Overlay: Storm Tide – Medium Hazard (in
part); Storm Tide – High Hazard (in part);
(c) Floodplain Assessment Overlay (Mossman River) (in part);
(d) Landscape Values Overlay: High Landscape Values (in part); and Medium
Landscape Values (in part); and
(e) Coastal Processes Overlay: Coastal Management District (in full); and
Erosion Prone Area (in part).
application for reconfiguring a lot in the Rural Zone is code assessable under
the planning scheme. The relevant assessment
benchmarks for the code assessment
of the development application are identified by the planning scheme as the
Rural Zone Code and
Reconfiguring a Lot Code. Although the Strategic Framework
provisions of the planning scheme are not in themselves assessment criteria
the application, they are directly called up by the Purpose of the Rural Zone
Code (s 6.2.10.2(2)(a)) as well as pursuant to
s 5.4(1)(c)(iv) of the planning
[23] Section
5.4(1)(c) of the planning scheme provides that:
assessable development
(i)is to be assessed against all the applicable codes identified in Column
(iii)that complies with:
(A) the purpose and overall outcomes of the code – complies with the
(B) the performance or the acceptable outcomes, where prescribed –
complies with the purpose and overall outcomes of the code;
(iv)is to have regard to the purposes of any instrument containing an
applicable code.
Note – In relation to section 5.4(1)(c)(iii) above, the associated
acceptable outcomes are technical measures or standards that
set a benchmark for
assessment of individual applications, which may only be varied on the merits of
an assessment of the corresponding
performance outcomes and the purpose and
overall outcomes of the relevant code.
Note – In relation to section 5.4(1)(c)(iv) above, and in regard to
section 313(3)(d) of the Act, the strategic framework (where
relevant) is
considered to be the purpose of the instrument containing an applicable
[24] Since s
1.3.2(3) of the scheme specifies that notes form part of the planning scheme,
the second note to s 5.4(1)(c)(iv) requires
that “the strategic framework
(where relevant) is considered to be the purpose of the instrument containing an
applicable code”.
And s 6.2.10.2(2) of the Purpose of the Rural Zone Code
includes a local government purpose that:
“(a) implement the
policy direction set in the Strategic Framework, in particular:
(ii) Theme 3: Natural resource management, Element 3.6.2 – Land and
catchment management, Element 3.6.3 Primary production,
forestry and fisheries,
Element 3.6.4 – Resource extraction.
(iii) Theme 5 Economy, Element 3.8.2 – Economic growth and
diversification, Element 3.8.4 – Primary production.”
Code Assessment and Decision Framework
[25] The appeal
is brought under s 229 and Sch I of the
Planning Act
and the provisions
Planning and Environment Court Act 2016
[26] The appeal
is to be heard by way of hearing
and must be decided by the
court standing in the shoes of the assessment manager. The court may confirm or
change the decision appealed
against, or set it aside and either replace it or
remit the matter to the Council.
appellant bears the onus in the
Planning Act
Planning and Environment Court Act
the appeal. As the development application required code assessment, the
decision of the court pursuant to
must be based, subject to
the assessment required by
of the Act.
[29] Accordingly,
the court must assess the development application only:
(a) Against the assessment benchmarks in a categorising instrument for the
development; and
(b) Having regard to any matters prescribed by regulation.
And after carrying out the assessment, the court:
(a) Must decide to approve the application to the extent the development
complies with all of the assessment benchmarks for the development;
(b) May decide to approve the application even if the development does not
comply with some of the assessment benchmarks;
(c) May impose development conditions on an approval; and
(d) May, to the extent the development does not comply with some or all the
assessment benchmarks, decide to refuse the application
only if compliance
cannot be achieved by imposing development conditions.
[30] Importantly,
non-compliance with the planning scheme should be “plainly
identified”.
Further, where
planning provisions are worded in vague and flexible terms, where there are no
clear or definitive criteria by which
the court can determine whether there is
conflict between a proposal and the planning scheme, the court has great width
in the decision-making
[31] Caution
must be exercised to avoid engaging in broader discretionary considerations.
Unlike an impact assessment, a code assessment
does not impose a statutory
obligation to advance the purpose of the
Planning Act
or to consider

narrowly focused, involving a comparative analysis of the development against
the applicable planning scheme benchmarks,

Policy and Regional Plan, as specified under
Regulation 2017

The purpose of the Rural zone code is to provide for:
(a) provide for
rural uses including cropping, intensive horticulture, intensive animal
industries, animal husbandry, animal keeping
and other primary production
activities;

Local Government Purpose and provisions of Part 3 - Strategic Framework
(Called up by Rural Zone Code s.6.2.10.2(2)(a)(ii) and (iii))
6.2.10.2(2)(a)
The local government purpose of the code is to:
(a) implement the policy direction set in the Strategic Framework, in
particular: ...
(ii) theme 3: Natural resource management ... Element 3.6.3 Primary production,
forestry and fisheries ...
Primary production is a significant part of the natural resource and
landscape value of the Shire. The Shire’s townships and
villages rely
heavily on their surrounding sugar cultivation, tropical agriculture,
horticulture and grazing industries. In particular,
the primacy of the sugar
cultivation will continue as a dominant rural pursuit in the Shire due to the
critical importance of the
sugar industry to the Shire. Continued support is
necessary to ensure the continued prosperity of these townships through the
of non-agricultural land use activities in primary production areas.
The viability of agricultural land is protected and maintained. Land uses
that have the potential to conflict with on-going primary
production are not
established in rural areas.
Lot reconfiguration does not result in the further fragmentation of rural
land. Boundary realignments only occur where improved agricultural
or environmental protection outcomes are demonstrated, or where they resolve
encroachments.
6.2.10.2(a)
The local government purpose of the code is to:
(a) implement the policy direction set in the Strategic Framework, in
particular: ...
(iii) theme 5 Economy, Element 3.8.2 – Economic growth and
diversification, Element 3.8.4 – Primary production.
The Mossman Mill, supporting the sugar industry, has been in operation for
over 120 years and is the primary economic driver in the
Shire. Elsewhere,
Douglas Shire is not characterised by a significant industrial base to support
its primary economic drivers of
tourism and primary production. However, value
adding manufacturing and processing, research and education can play an
role in the future of economic growth opportunities in the Shire. The
lower operational costs for businesses and the unique lifestyle
that the Shire
offers should be promoted to attract new employment opportunities and economic
Economic growth that supports clean, green businesses and resilient
communities is encouraged throughout the Shire. In particular
economic initiatives is facilitated in appropriate locations, including:
(a) the growth of new and traditional industries; ...
(i) protecting the assets on which existing and future business relies, such as
agricultural land resources and the beautiful natural
environment;
Primary production, in particular the dominant sugar industry, and
associated manufacturing has always been a significant contributor
Shire’s economy. Considerable opportunities exist to add value to primary
produce and to diversify the base income
of the rural sector and improve
employment opportunities. The Shire’s competitive strengths of rich
agricultural soils, tropical
climate with high rainfall, and proximity to Cairns
should be promoted to attract new industries complementary to the Shire’s
The availability and viability of rural land for on-going agricultural uses
is not compromised by inappropriate or incompatible development.
6.2.10.2(b)
The local government purpose of the code is to: ...
(b) recognise the primacy of rural production, in particular sugar
cultivation, and other farming practices in rural areas.
Overall outcome
6.2.10.2(3)(a)
The purpose of the code will be achieved through the following overall
(a) areas for use for primary production are conserved and fragmentation
is avoided. ...
6.2.10.2(3)(c)
(c) adverse impacts of land use, both on-site and on adjoining areas, are
avoided and any unavoidable impacts are minimised through
location, design,
operation and management.
Performance outcome
6.2.10.3 – PO5
Uses and other development include those that:
(a) promote rural activities such as agriculture, rural enterprises and small
scale industries that serve rural activities; or
(b) promote low impact tourist activities based on the appreciation of the rural
character, landscape and rural activities; or
(c) are compatible with rural activities.
6.2.10.3 – PO7
The minimum lot size is 40 hectares, unless:
(a) the lot reconfiguration results in no additional lots
(e.g. amalgamation, boundary realignments to resolve encroachments); or
(b) the reconfiguration is limited to one additional lot to accommodate:
(i) telecommunications facility;
(ii) utility installation.

Lots have sufficient areas, dimensions and shapes to be suitable for their
intend (sic) use taking into account environmental features
constraints;
Performance outcome
9.4.7.3 – PO1
Lots comply with the lot reconfiguration outcomes of the applicable Zone
code in Part 5 (sic).
appellant contends that the proposal complies with the planning scheme,
asserting that it will allow for continuing and additional
rural uses while not
causing impermissible fragmentation of rural or agricultural land, either by
avoiding fragmentation entirely
or resulting in only minor or technical
fragmentation that does not warrant refusal of the application. In contrast,
the Council
contends that the land, being suitable for primary production now or
in the future, should be protected from impermissible fragmentation
from the proposal.
[34] While the
term “primary production” is often used in the provisions of the
Rural Code and the incorporated provisions
of the Strategic Framework, it is not
defined in the planning scheme, yet its meaning is central to the appeal in the
various contexts
of its use in the relevant provisions.
[35] The Rural
Code purposes in ss 6.2.10.2(1)(a) and (c), seek to support “rural
uses” such as cropping, intensive horticulture,
intensive animal
industries, animal husbandry, animal keeping, and other “primary
production” activities while protecting
and managing significant natural
resources and processes to sustain the capacity for “primary
production”. Section 3.6.3
in the Strategic Framework provides that
“primary production is a significant part of the natural resource and
landscape value
of the Shire”. Overall outcome s 6.2.10.2(3)(a) requires
that “areas for use for primary production are conserved and
fragmentation
is avoided”. Incidentally, land uses such as animal husbandry, cropping,
function facility (small-scale), roadside
stall, rural industry, tourist
attraction (small-scale), tourist park (small-scale), and wholesale nursery are
“rural activities”
that are self-assessable in the Rural Zone.
[36] It is trite
law that the
ejusdem generis
principle provides that where general words
or phrases follow a number of specific words or phrases, the general words are
specifically
construed as limited and apply only to things of the same kind or
class as those expressly mentioned, here for example, as a rural
use subject of
the Rural Code purposes in ss 6.2.10.2(1)(a).
[37] Schedule 1
of the planning scheme defines the land uses of cropping, intensive
horticulture, intensive animal industries, animal
husbandry, and animal keeping
as follows:
Examples include
Does not include the following examples
Premises used for growing plants or plant material for commercial purposes
where dependent on the cultivation of soil.
The use includes harvesting and the storage and packing of produce and
plants grown on the site and the ancillary repair and servicing
of machinery
used on the site.
Fruit, nut, vegetable and grain production, forestry for wood production,
fodder and pasture production, plant fibre production, sugar
cane growing,
Permanent plantations, intensive horticulture, rural industry.
Intensive horticulture
Premises used for the intensive production of plants or plant material on
imported media and located within a building or structure
or where outdoors,
artificial lights or containers are used. The use includes the storage and

on the subject site.
Greenhouse and shade house plant production, hydroponic farms, mushroom
Wholesale nursery.
Intensive animal industry
Premises used for the intensive production of animals or animal products in
an enclosure that requires the provision of food and water
either mechanically
or by hand. The use includes the ancillary storage and packing of feed and
Feedlots, piggeries, poultry and egg production.
Animal husbandry, aquaculture, drought feeding, milking sheds, shearing
sheds, weaning pens.
Animal husbandry
Premises used for production of animals or animal products on either native
or improved pastures or vegetation. The use includes ancillary

and temporary holding facilities and the repair and servicing of
Cattle studs, grazing of livestock, non-feedlot dairying.
Animal keeping, intensive animal industry, aquaculture, feedlots,
Animal keeping
Premises used for boarding, breeding or training of animals. The use may
include ancillary temporary or permanent holding facilities

principles applicable to the construction of planning documents were restated by
the Court of Appeal in
Zappala Family Co Pty Ltd v Brisbane City Council
[2014] QCA 147
(2014) 201 LGERA 82.
The court noted that the same principles that apply to
statutory construction apply to the construction of planning
, but that this still
allows for the expressed view that such documents need to be read in a way which
is practical, read as a whole
and as intending to achieve a balance between
The discussion by this
court of relevant principles in
Westfield Management Ltd v Pine Rivers Shire
has commonly been
referred to by this court with apparent approval in
. In the context
of this case, the following principles of construing planning schemes are
(a) They should be construed broadly, rather than pedantically or narrowly, and
with a sensible, practical approach;
(b) They should be construed as a whole; and
(c) They should be construed in a way that best achieves their apparent purpose
and objects.
[39] Bearing
these things in mind, it seems to me that primary production ought be construed
as being limited and applying only to
land-based uses and activities of the same
kind or class of those defined and exemplified in columns 1, 2 and 3; that grow
plants or animals, or produce plant or animal-based products, for
commercial purposes, relying on natural resources (soil, water,
pastures) but
may include controlled environments (greenhouses, feedlots). It includes both
extensive (like animal husbandry, cropping)
and intensive (like intensive
horticulture, intensive animal uses) forms of production as exemplified in
column 3, but it excludes
activities like those otherwise included in column 4.
Rural Zone Code
appellant contends that the proposed development complies with the Rural Zone
Code, asserting that there is no mandatory
minimum lot size, the proposal will
not impact the productive capacity of rural land for primary production, or
compromise its long-term
use for rural purposes. The appellant contends that
the proposal does not cause impermissible fragmentation of rural or agricultural
land under the scheme’s proper interpretation. Even if there is
fragmentation, it is technical or minor and does not justify
refusal. He argues
that the proposal creates three additional rural lots aligning with the existing
rural residential pattern on
the southern side. It respects the land’s
natural features, such as watercourses and vegetation, and its constraints for
rural uses.
majority of the land is preserved for broad-acre primary production, like sugar
cane cultivation, with necessary infrastructure
and two access points to Mowbray
River Road. Proposed lot 1 includes an existing dwelling, a large farm
machinery shed, and areas
suitable for both broad-acre production and
small-scale rural activities, such as horse keeping and horticulture. The
development
ensures the continuation of small-scale pursuits on the land and
places the second existing dwelling on a new allotment (proposed
lot 4), near
existing residential development. The new lots are sized to support small-scale
rural uses, including horse keeping,
without compromising existing activities.
He argues that the development will maintain the land’s capacity for rural
including primary production, and may even enhance opportunities for
additional realistic rural uses.
[42] The Council
maintains that the proposal does not comply with the Rural Zone Code because it
results in the fragmentation of good
quality agricultural land; the proposal
would be inconsistent with a clear and deliberate forward planning strategy;
compliance with
the assessment benchmarks cannot be achieved by imposition of
conditions; and there are no other compelling reasons to warrant approval
proposal in the circumstances. The Council argues that the land remains
suitable for primary production now or in the future,
and should be protected
from fragmentation; that the application to create rural residential lots is an
opportunistic attempt to
subdivide valuable agricultural land, a finite
resource; that the closure of the Mossman Mill underscores the need to preserve
land, as highlighted in the Mossman Transition Plan; that the appellant's
experts underestimated the land’s agricultural potential,
focusing on
commercial and economic factors rather than its capacity for activities like
cropping, grazing, and horticulture; that
the proposed subdivision fragments
the land, fails to ensure lots are suitable for primary production alongside
dwellings, and does
not comply with assessment benchmarks.
planning scheme seeks to achieve the purpose of the Rural Zone Code through the
overall outcomes, relevantly here, by s 6.2.10.2(3)(a)
to conserve areas for
primary production and avoid fragmentation, and by 6.2.10.2(3)(c) to ensures
adverse impacts from land use
(on-site and on adjoining areas) are avoided or
minimised through appropriate location, design, operation, and management.
[44] Relevant
here, the purpose of the Rural Zone Code is to provide for a wide range of rural
uses such as cropping, intensive horticulture,
intensive animal industries,
animal husbandry, animal keeping, and other primary production activities,
and to protect or manage
significant natural resources and processes to maintain
the capacity for that primary production. The code recognises the primacy
of rural production, especially sugar cultivation, in rural areas. It also
incorporated provisions of the Strategic Framework to
implement themes of
natural resource management, economy, economic growth and diversification, and
primary production.
It thereby emphasises the significance of primary
production (e.g., sugar cultivation, tropical agriculture, horticulture,
to the Shire’s natural resource and landscape value. It
prioritises protecting the viability of agricultural land and preventing
non-agricultural uses or fragmentation that could conflict with primary
production. It highlights the economic importance of primary
production,
particularly the sugar industry (e.g., Mossman Mill), and encourages economic
growth that supports agricultural land
and complementary industries without
compromising rural land viability.
diversification process, though still in early stages, has begun, as shown in
the Mossman Transition Plan Summary, which
explores potential future crops and
industries. This is not a case where the broader strategic planning goal of
preventing fragmentation
of primary production areas has been outdated by
protection of areas for use for primary production with good quality
agricultural land from fragmentation is an important
planning strategy which
finds its genesis in the State Planning Policy, is supported by the Far North
Queensland Regional Plan 2009-2031
and has resulted in the implementation of
strategies in local planning instruments.
[47] The State
Planning Policy explicitly seeks to avoid fragmentation of good quality
agricultural land “into lot sizes inconsistent
with the current or
potential use of the land for agriculture”. This ensures that land with
high-quality soils or other attributes
suitable for farming remains viable for
primary production. So much is already reflected in the planning scheme and
requires no
further application here.
[48] This is
also consistent with the Regional Plan, which also identifies fragmentation as a
cause of the loss of good quality agricultural
land and relationship with the
region’s capacity to support primary production, particularly sugar
cultivation, a dominant
economic activity in the Shire. It provides
fragmentation has accumulative impacts which may contribute adversely to the
region’s economic potential, environmental
health and community wellbeing.
Issues include:
fragmentation
causing loss of good quality agricultural land
economic viability of small cane farms
viability of sugar mills due to loss of cane lands to urban development or other
fragmentation of
wildlife corridors and areas of ecological significance
conflicts between agricultural practices and urban living
restrictions on
access to and use of non-renewable resources
infrastructure
and servicing costs”.
[49] These are
also appropriately reflected in the planning scheme and require no further
application here.
McClelland described historical land use as part of his family’s sugarcane
farming operations, spanning four generations
since 1934. He recalled that
parts of the property historically supported tropical fruit orchards (mainly
citrus, with some other
tropical fruits) near Mowbray River Road and Spring
Creek. During the Sheraton Mirage Resort construction, a quarry was operated
the farm’s stoney middle section, near the current bin stands. He states
that the Equinox family, who purchased the farm
from the Verinese family (who
bought it from the Robbins brothers), increased the cane area, which remained
consistent under their
ownership. He remembered that no other crops were
cultivated except for the orchard area, and the property was not used for
or horse pasturing.
[51] Ms. Sophie
Horman drew on her experience to testify about the typical cost for ownership of
a horse, associated activities, and
other costs related to the property on which
horses are kept. These costs help support the local and regional economy,
businesses that provide rural feed and ancillary supplies,
veterinarian services, and Pony Clubs.
[52] Ms. Angela
Constable testified about her use of intensive horticulture, which contributes
to the local and regional economy,
can be carried out at a scale that does not
necessitate a large area of land, such as proposed lots 2 to 4. She identifies

[53] I have the
benefit of expert evidence from William Thompson, Neil Sutherland, and Philip
Matthew regarding Good Quality Agricultural
Land, Land Capability, and Rural
Use, as presented in their joint expert report, individual expert statements,
and oral testimonies.
Each expert’s opinion is confined to their
respective areas of expertise: Mr. Thompson addressed Good Quality Agricultural
Land, Land Capability, and Rural Use; Mr. Matthew focused on Rural Use; and Dr.
Sutherland addressed Good Quality Agricultural Land
and Land Capability.
[54] The joint
expert report records an apparent expert consensus that “the land to the
south of Seasonal Creek has been already
fragmented and separated from the
adjacent agricultural land by the natural features of the landform and
vegetation, in our view”,
and the proposal will allow continued rural use
on the land as follows:
“18. The proposed lot containing
the cane land could continue to be used for cropping, the growing of sugar cane,
animal keeping,
the agistment of horses, and for a dwelling house –
consistent uses in the rural zone.
19. Under the proposal, the existing cane land cropping area (to the
north of Seasonal Creek) would remain unchanged and would not
reduce either in
size or potential productivity.
20. The rural residential land (and the residences) immediately south of
the proposed land for subdivision along Mowbray River Road
pose a limitation on
the potential agricultural use of the land for cropping or more intensive
horticultural use.
21. The size of the proposed smaller lots adjacent to Mowbray River Road,
namely 2.6 ha and two further lots of 1.7 ha each, is sufficient
to facilitate
small-scale rural pursuits (for instance, but not limited to, grazing and/or
horse agistment or the keeping of horses
for personal use).
22. In this, by accounting for the adjacent non-rural land users,
existing landform, and topography, the proposal reasonably accommodates
existing degree of rural uses. The residences would be ancillary to any rural
23. Collectively and given these features, the land has been alienated
from long-term agricultural use, rendering it unsuitable for
intensive forms of
agriculture yet still suitable for grazing and/or horse agistment.
24. As such, the subdivision and the creation of the proposed lots would
have no deleterious impact on the agricultural productivity
of the site,
locality, or region, in our view.”
[55] The later
attribution to Mr. Thompson (“WT”) that he “agrees with the
general key points made in the preceding
sections”, should be read in
light of the points of disagreement and responses by Mr. Matthew
(“PM”) that followed:
proposed lots 2, 3 and 4 which border Mowbray River Road, whilst no longer used
for cane are ALC A and therefore are still suited
for cane farming. The
affidavit of Chris McClelland also notes that a range of horticulture crops had
been grown on these lots by
previous land owners.
WT has concerns that the proposed subdivision if considered as an infill
would arise if cane
was grown on the proposed Lots 2, 3 and 4. The McClelland affidavit refers to
the potential for land use conflict.
Reverse amenity affects associated with cane do occur and there is a range
of industry recommended best practise management approaches
that mitigate these
impacts. In the far North Queensland industry, cane farming in close proximity
to residential uses is very common.
: Unfortunately, in terms of agricultural use, the land
in question has not been used for sugar cane, or any other more intense use
grazing, for some years. It is likely the residents have become accustomed to
the grazing use. Regardless of any subdivision,
the grazing land use is likely
to continue.
In this proposed subdivision, Mowbray River Road separates the area of ALC
A suited lands from the adjoining rural residential area
to the south by a
distance of approximately 40 m.
: I also note the proposed RoL has what is referred to as a
set back line width of 6m between Lots 2, 3 and 4 and Lot 1 - which is
largest lot resulting from the RoL. Such a proposal in the absence of building
envelopes and buffer conditions on the RoL will
inevitably result in elevated
land conflict.
: It would not be unreasonable for the proponent to
identify the building envelopes. This could be conditioned, in my view.
: The proposed RoL will result in 3 smaller lots of areas
ranging from 1.7 to 2.6 ha each of which are agreed in this JER as being
Immediately opposite the proposed RoL north of Mowbray River there are 11 lots
of similar size ranges to the proposed RoL.
All are used for commercial cropping
(cane) with only 2 having residential structures. This suggests that cane
farming on suitable
land is common in these parts of the Mowbray Valley and that
the demand for more small lots to replace cropping by residential uses
alienate ALC A may not be significant.
: I am not an expert in the assessment of residential
demand and leave this matter for the assessment of others.
Thompson later recanted from the scope of agreement attributed to him, by his
supplementary report, saying that:
(a) “... the natural features associated with water courses and
residual vegetation are a common feature of the commercial cane
industry in the
wet tropical coast. These natural features are neither a common nor an important
factor in alienating existing cropping
areas from continued
(b) “... the available irrigation methodologies are able to irrigate
small areas efficiently. For example, travelling irrigators
which are very
commonly used for dry season irrigation are able to be adjusted in the field to
change the height, width and duration
of an irrigation event. The 293ML/annum
of available water would efficiently irrigate up to 30ha of perennial
horticulture crop
or cane. Dry season irrigation is necessary for horticulture
and is a key requirement for diversification within the cane
(c) “... the road corridor and best practise management recommended by
the industry will mitigate amenity effects for the existing
Rural Residential
areas. These existing rural residential areas are mainly upslope of the GQAL
area which is proposed for subdivision
under this [reconfiguration]. This
currently helps minimise amenity impacts
The proposed areas to be subdivided have an extensive history of
cropping land use and are not currently alienated from cropping.
proposed [reconfiguration] would permanently alienate the proposed subdivision
area from existing and potential local cropping
uses. Commercial forms of
cropping uses such as cane, horticulture and dry season irrigated row crops
would not be sustainable on
the rural residential sized lots proposed under this
[reconfiguration]. Unlike commercial crops which require Agricultural Land Class
A lands, hobby small scale forms of grazing (horses and cattle) which might
develop have no requirement for this quality of land.
The conclusion [by Mr
Sutherland and Mr Matthew,] of no deleterious effects assumes that the proposed
lots are already unable to
be cropped and that the [reconfiguration] would not
generate reverse amenity impacts. The proposed [reconfiguration] will in fact
produce reverse amenity impacts and will reduce the amount of quality cropping
land in the area. These are deleterious impacts
[57] In his
individual report and later testimony, Mr. Thompson maintained that the land,
particularly the front 10 hectares comprising
lots 2, 3, and 4, remains Class A
and suitable for cane, despite not being currently used for it. He disagreed
with Mr. Matthew’s
view that the southern land is alienated from primary
production due to economic barriers, stating that economic viability should
be a consideration when the strategic objective is to protect Good Quality
Agricultural Land based on soil and suitability criteria.
He emphasised that
physical features like watercourses and vegetation, common in the wet tropical
coast, are not significant barriers
to cane farming, though he acknowledged that
Seasonal Creek crossings are currently unusable and require maintenance. He
the loss of the proposed lots’ area would have an
“immeasurably small” impact on local agricultural productivity
an even smaller regional impact. Under cross-examination, while maintaining
concerns about reverse amenity impacts, he conceded
that these can be
“largely” mitigated through standard planning measures like setbacks
and buffers. He also highlighted
that fragmentation increases complexity and
conflict potential, including for small-scale cropping.
Thompson supported his position with historical CSIRO/Murtha soil survey and
LIDAR data, affirming the suitability of the
proposed lots for horticulture or
cane cropping. Drawing on his knowledge of Mowbray Valley soils and agricultural
practices, despite
inspecting the land shortly before testifying, he argued that
the proposal would permanently alienate quality land from commercial
as small lots under separate ownership suit only hobby grazing and activities
not requiring Class A land. He described
recent smaller-scale uses (e.g.,
grazing) over the last 20 years as “holding uses,” temporary due to
non-durable infrastructure.
Matthew, an expert in rural land use, provided consistent opinions across the
joint expert report, his individual reports
dated 20 November 2024 and 11
December 2024 (responding to Mr. Thompson’s affidavit and statement of
evidence), and his testimony.
His key points are summarized as follows.
[60] During
cross-examination, Mr. Matthew acknowledged that larger lots are generally more
productive than subdivided ones, as subdivisions
reduce agricultural land
through buffers, roads, building envelopes, effluent disposal, and fallow
periods that lower productivity.
However, he maintained that the grazing land in
proposed lots 2, 3, and 4 is already fragmented and alienated from adjacent
agricultural
land due to natural features, including Seasonal Creek, Spring
Creek, Mowbray River, associated vegetation, and topography, as well
proximity to rural residential areas south of Mowbray River Road. He argued that
the proposal represents an infill of existing
smaller lots, which does not
compromise rural productivity or the land’s long-term utility for rural
[61] In response
to Mr. Thompson’s divergence from the joint expert report, Mr. Matthew
reiterated in his reports and testimony
that, while natural features are common
in the cane industry and not inherently alienating, the specific combination of
vegetation,
topography, and historical non-use for cane since at least 2004 has
already fragmented the grazing land from intensive cropping.
He further noted
that broadacre cropping, such as industrial hemp or grains, is unsuitable for
the front grazing land due to similar
conflicts and risks as cane, as
highlighted in the context of the Mossman Transition Plan. He emphasised that
the proposal does not
increase alienation and supports rural uses such as
grazing, horse agistment, small-scale horticulture, or ancillary tourism
with agriculture.
[62] Mr. Matthew
addressed potential amenity impacts from converting the land to cane, such as
dust, noise, or pesticide odours. He
explained that a 40m road corridor, the
topographic slope (with proposed lots lower and sloping away from existing rural
residential
areas), and industry best practices, such as low-pressure spraying,
shielded systems, and avoiding windy conditions per the Sugar
Research Australia
Weed Management Manual, would mitigate reverse amenity effects. He also
supported the use of vegetated buffers,
such as 10m-wide tree canopies along
boundaries, if needed, but argued that there are no net deleterious effects on
rural use. This
is because the land is unlikely to revert to cane due to
long-term resident acclimation to grazing and higher risks of conflict.
maintained that the proposed lots are not viable for commercial cropping due to
size and layout constraints, consistent with
historical adaptive uses. Economic
factors also support this view, as horse agistment provides higher net income
than cane cropping,
requires fewer inputs, avoids regulatory hurdles (such as
environmental impact assessments and authorities for conversion to intensive
farming in the Great Barrier Reef catchment), and involves lower capital costs
for small crops or orchards, including irrigation.
[64] Mr. Matthew
asserted that the proposal retains productive capacity for rural uses exempt
from environmental impact assessments,
such as small-scale horticulture, animal
keeping, or horse agistment on residual areas per lot after accounting for
dwellings and
buffers. He concluded that the proposal can be conditioned with
vegetated buffers, building envelopes if required, and potential
water licence
amendments to protect good quality agricultural land and rural processes.
Importantly, the proposal does not fragment
the operational cane land north of
Seasonal Creek, which remains intact at 47.53 ha.
Sutherland, an expert in good quality agricultural land and land capability,
consistently upheld his opinions from the joint
expert report in his individual
report dated 11 December 2024 and oral testimony. He maintained that the
proposed development and
mix of created allotments will not result in the loss,
fragmentation, or alienation of viable, good-quality agricultural land. His
points are summarised as follows.
Sutherland noted that the land comprising the proposed smaller lots 2, 3, and 4
is currently used for grazing and horse agistment
and is already limited by
natural fragmentation from Seasonal Creek, vegetation, topography, environmental
constraints, proximity
to rural residential areas, and the high costs associated
with reverting to intensive cropping like sugarcane. He emphasised that
proposal preserves the land’s overall agricultural productivity, as the
smaller lots remain suitable for sustainable rural
uses such as grazing, animal
keeping, or small-scale irrigated horticulture, without impacting the broader
locality or region.
[67] In his
individual report, Dr. Sutherland responded to Mr. Thompson’s divergence
from the joint expert report. While acknowledging
that the land is classified as
Agricultural Land Class A based on site observations, including three boreholes
dug to 600 mm, he
opined that it does not fully meet Strategic Cropping Land
criteria due to slope and area limitations. During oral testimony, he
his disagreement with Mr. Thompson by conceding that the soils in lots 2, 3, and
4 remain suitable for cane farming. However,
he maintained that reverting to
cane would be impractical and costly due to requirements for erosion control,
stormwater structures,
and regulatory compliance. When challenged on these
costs, he acknowledged that reversion might be less prohibitive and that
viability is a matter for other experts.
Sutherland conceded in oral evidence that lots 2, 3, and 4 are too small for
broadscale cropping or large commercial horticulture.
Nevertheless, he argued
that the proposal does not further fragment viable, good-quality agricultural
land, as these lots are well-suited
to sustainable, smaller-scale rural uses,
such as grazing for ruminants (e.g., cattle, horses, goats, sheep) or
horticulture (e.g.,
stone fruits, nuts, tomatoes, seasonal vegetables in raised
beds or roadside stalls). These uses, he noted, do not reduce the land’s
overall capability or generate reverse amenity impacts. He further explained
that irrigation for large-scale cane on smaller areas
is impractical due to
equipment costs, inefficiencies, noise, and water loss, but it is suitable for
small-scale horticulture.
maintained that the land south of Seasonal Creek is already alienated from
intensive agriculture due to fragmentation by Seasonal
Creek, vegetation, and
areas regulated as Matters of State Environmental Significance, which separate
it from the northern cane land.
Rejecting Mr. Thompson’s position that
such features are common in the cane industry and do not alienate land from
Dr. Sutherland argued that these site-specific factors, combined with
State environmental overlays, effectively fragment the area.
Sutherland also supported the feasibility of buffers to mitigate amenity impacts
to or from adjacent rural residential lots,
aligning with industry best
practices. He noted that the topographic positioning of upslope residences
already minimises these effects.
[71] I also have
the benefit of expert town planning evidence from Natalie Rayment and Greg
Ovenden in their joint expert report,
individual expert statements, and oral
testimony. Much of their opinion evidence transgresses on the court’s
role of curating
the evidence of other witnesses, and interpreting and applying
the provisions of the planning instruments to the ultimate issues,
which is of
no evidentiary weight. Otherwise, the town planning considerations are short in
[72] Ms. Rayment
relied on the soils and agricultural land experts to join in the opinion that
the proposal will not result in further
fragmentation of rural land for primary
production because:
(a) The northern area of the land (proposed lot 1) remains over 40 hectares and
maintains the use of the land for primary production
as it can continue to be
used for cropping, the growing of sugar cane, animal keeping, the agistment of
horses and a dwelling house,
consistent with uses in the rural zone;
(b) Proposed lots 2, 3 and 4 are on land that has already been fragmented and
separated from the part of the site being used for
primary production,
separating the land to the south, adjacent to Mowbray River Road, from the land
to the north by Seasonable Creek;
(c) The proposed subdivision will have no deleterious impact on the agricultural
productivity of the site, locality or region; and
(d) The proposed reconfiguration instead provides for infill development along
the Mowbray River Road frontage.
concludes that maintains the capacity of the site for rural uses and activities;
protects or manages significant natural
resources by maintaining the
site’s capacity for primary production; recognises the primacy of rural
production; facilitates
rural activities; and does not further fragment land for
primary production.
[74] I do not
accept that the land has such existing constraints as asserted by Dr.
Sutherland, Mr. Matthew and Ms. Rayment to already
fragment or alienate the
areas comprising the southern balance of proposed lot 1 and the proposed lots 2,
3, and 4 because:
(a) The proposed reconfiguration bears no compelling relationship to the
asserted natural fragmentation caused by Seasonal Creek,
associated vegetation
and the topography of the land.
(b) Seasonal Creek, an ephemeral creek, does not significantly fragment the
land. Existing tracks allow crossing, and cane farming
commonly operates across
such creeks in the region, as supported by Mr. Thompson's evidence and aerial
imagery showing farm connectivity.
(c) State-mapped vegetation along the creek lacks an ecological assessment to
confirm its significance. Mapped areas include existing
cane land and dwellings,
and clearing for infrastructure (e.g., tracks) is permitted under
self-assessable codes, requiring minimal
effort to maintain access.
(d) The current use of the land for horse agistment is a temporary holding use.
Reversion costs to cane or other cropping are not
prohibitive.
(e) The existing water allocation supports irrigating up to 50 hectares of cane
or 30 hectares of orchards, sufficient for the proposed
lots. Irrigation can be
extended to the front portion, with costs estimated at $3,000 per hectare, and
practical solutions like Briggs
irrigators are viable for shorter crops.
(f) Mr. Matthew's concerns about land use conflicts with nearby rural
residential lots are mitigated by topography, vegetation, and
distances. Best practice management can address reverse amenity impacts.
(g) Grazing requires no environmental authority, and commercial cropping on less
than 5 hectares of uncropped land is exempt. Even
if required, obtaining an
environmental authority is a standard process not unique to this land.
[75] It seems to
me that these matters completely undermine the force of the evidence of Dr.
Sutherland, Mr. Matthew and Ms. Rayment
in support of the proposal.
[76] I prefer
the evidence of Mr. Thompson over that of Dr. Sutherland and Mr. Matthew
regarding the suitability of the land for large-scale
primary production,
including sugarcane cropping, animal husbandry, and broadacre primary
production. Mr. Thompson’s evidence,
supported by historical use data,
soil quality assessments, and topographic evaluations, persuasively demonstrates
that the land,
including proposed lots 2, 3, and 4 fronting Mowbray River Road,
remains viable for these rural uses despite recent small-scale grazing
activities, which he characterises as temporary “holding uses”. Mr.
Thompson’s rejection of economic viability
as a relevant criterion aligns
with the planning scheme’s emphasis on preserving good quality
agricultural land for its inherent
productive capacity, as articulated in the
Strategic Framework (s 3.6.3.1(1)) and Rural Zone Code (s 6.2.10.2(1)(c)). His
corroborated by Mr. McClelland’s testimony of historical
sugarcane cropping and other horticultural activities, underscores
land’s Class A status and its suitability for continued primary production
albeit with some rehabilitation to restore creek
crossing and southern
topography. The proposal, by creating lots 2, 3 and 4 of 1.7, 1.7 and 2.6
hectares, will compromise and limit
these lots to smaller-scale rural uses and
hobby activities, which do not require good quality agricultural land, thereby
fragmenting
the land and undermining its capacity for larger-scale rural
Sutherland and Mr. Matthew’s opinions in reliance on historical use
patterns, economic barriers to reversion (e.g.,
costs of infrastructure and
regulatory compliance), and perceived fragmentation by natural features like
Seasonal Creek and vegetation
are overestimated. Their assertion that the land
south of Seasonal Creek is already alienated due to natural features is
unpersuasive,
given the demonstrated access across the creek, the commonality of
such features in the cane industry, and the land’s size,
topography, and
soil quality, which sustain its suitability for primary production. It seems to
me that the evidence prioritises
short-term private interests over the planning
scheme’s clear intent to protect areas for use for primary production on
land, which is good quality agricultural land, for long-term productivity (s
3.6.3.1(3)).
[78] I find that
the land, including proposed lots 2, 3, and 4 fronting Mowbray River Road,
remains suitable for intended rural uses,
including large-scale cropping, animal
husbandry, and broadacre primary production, due to its size, topography, and
soil quality.
That area for use for primary production will not be conserved but
will be fragmented, contrary to overall outcome of s 6.2.10.2(3)(a)
because the
proposal will limit their use to small-scale rural uses and hobby activities to
the extent it would remain after reverse
amenity mitigation like dedicated
building envelopes and buffers.
proposed development fails to comply with the Rural Zone Code’s purpose in
ss 6.2.10.2(1)(a)&(c), (2)(a) &
(b) (including the incorporated
provisions of the Strategic Framework of protecting agricultural land viability
– s 3.6.3.1(1)
& (3), and 3.8.4.1(3)) and overall outcomes (s
6.2.10.2(3)(a) & (c)), because, while it might accommodate smaller rural
and activities by proposed lots 2, 3, and 4, it does so at the cost of
further fragmenting good quality agricultural land, thereby
compromising and
failing to protect, maintain, and conserve the current or potential areas for
use for primary production on the
land. The proposal is incapable of complying
with the overall outcomes, including performance outcome PO7 due to the
fragmentation
of the land by creating lots 2, 3 and 4 of 1.7, 1.7 to 2.6
hectares, respectively, being smaller than 40 hectares.
[80] I accept
that it is a mere deemed measure of compliance, but it seems to me that the
limited use and sizes of proposed lots 2,
3 and 4 are so inadequate that I see
no other acceptable outcome, including conditions considered below, that could
achieve compliance
with the Rural Zone Code.
Reconfiguring a Lot Code
Reconfiguration a Lot Code purpose 9.4.7.2(2)(b) requires lots that have
sufficient areas, dimensions and shapes to be suitable
for their intended use,
taking into account environmental features and site constraints. Performance
outcome PO1 requires compliance
with the lot reconfiguration outcomes of the
Rural Zone Code.
appellant argues that the proposal complies with the Reconfiguration of a Lot
Code, by creating lots with sufficient areas,
dimensions, and shapes suitable
for intended larger scale rural uses in proposed lot 1 and for realistic
smaller-scale rural uses
in proposed lots 2, 3 and 4 like horse keeping and
horticulture aligning with the rural residential pattern, while respecting
fragmentation by environmental features and site constraints that limit
the scope of rural activities.
[83] The Council
maintains that the proposal fails to comply with the Reconfiguration of a Lot
Code, for the same reasons as contended
for the Rural Zone Code, by creating
lots lacking sufficient areas, dimensions, and shapes that will permanently
fragment the land
that remains suitable for large-scale primary production uses
of cropping, grazing, and horticulture, where good quality agricultural
finite and there are no effective environmental or site constraints. It argues
that the proposal does not satisfy performance
outcome PO1, as it contravenes
Rural Zone Code outcomes through fragmentation that undermines rural land
protection.
[84] I have
concluded that the land, including proposed lots 2, 3, and 4 fronting Mowbray
River Road, remains suitable for intended
rural uses, including large-scale
cropping, animal husbandry, and broadacre primary production, due to its size,
topography, and
soil quality. The proposal, by creating lots 2, 3 and 4 of 1.7,
1.7 and 2.6 hectares, would compromise and limit these lots to smaller-scale
rural uses and hobby activities. By Mr. Thompson’s evidence, it is
apparent that the proposed lots are unsuitable for sustainable
agricultural activities, including sugarcane cultivation, horticulture, or
irrigated row cropping. Dr. Sutherland also
accepted that the lots are
insufficient in size for broadacre cropping. He further accepts that commercial
horticultural use, such
as that exemplified by Ms. Constable’s enterprise
on part of the land, would be constrained to approximately one hectare for
nascent commercial operation given the requisite buffering and building
envelopes that must be imposed. Even so, conditions necessary
to mitigate
potential reverse amenity impacts further diminish the practicable area
available for such agricultural pursuits.
[85] In these
circumstances, it seems to me that the proposal does not comply with the purpose
of the Reconfiguration of a Lot Code,
as it produces lots with insufficient
areas, dimensions, and shapes to be suitable for their intended rural uses,
particularly sugar
cane cropping and other broad-acre primary production. And
given my findings in relation to non-compliance with the Rural Zone Code,
proposal does not comply with the purpose or performance outcome PO1 of the
Reconfiguration of a Lot Code.
[86] Again, it
seems to me that the limited use and sizes of proposed lots 2, 3 and 4 are so
inadequate that I see no other acceptable
outcome, including conditions
considered below, that could achieve compliance with the Reconfiguration of a

appellant contends that any concerns about the continuation of rural uses and
any reverse amenity impacts can be addressed
through conditions of approval,
such as building envelopes and boundary buffers for proposed lots 2, 3, and 4.
The Council maintains
that the proposal fragments the land and fails to ensure
lots are suitable for primary production alongside dwellings; and that this
non-compliance causes broader planning harm and loss of productive capacity,
which cannot be mitigated through conditions.
[89] Having
regard to my findings that the proposal further fragments the good quality
agricultural land with the proposed lots 2,
3 and 4 being of insufficient area,
dimensions shapes, and uses, it seems to me that building envelopes and
vegetated buffers, to
mitigate reverse amenity impacts would consume any
additional good quality agricultural land, further reducing the land available
for primary production. Furthermore, the acknowledged reverse amenity impacts,
while partially mitigable through buffers, further
highlight the broader
planning harm of fragmentation, as the proposal would permanently alienate areas
of primary production, with
good quality agricultural land, from its intended
rural uses. This will be further entrenched by the need for areas to be subject
of building envelopes and buffers. In my view, the extent of non-compliance,
particularly the fragmentation caused by the smaller
lots 2, 3 and 4 cannot be
remedied through conditions, as the size of available quality land is critical
for the intended rural uses
in the Rural Zone Code.
[90] In these
circumstances, the extent of non-compliance with the assessment benchmarks
cannot be addressed through the imposition
of lawful development conditions.
Should the development application be approved in the exercise
of the discretion under
Planning Act
[91] Having
found that the non-compliance with the assessment benchmarks cannot be remedied
by conditions, the appellant urges the
court to exercise its discretion under
to approve the application having regard to:
(a) The following matters which the appellant alleges are relevant (which are
not admitted by the Respondent):
(i) complies with the Codes when considered as a whole;
(ii) is consistent with the surrounding pattern of development;
(iii) satisfactorily responds to the existing and intended character of the
(iv) maintains an appropriate use of the Land under the Rural zone;
(v) is sympathetic to the Land’s features and topography, and surrounding
development and land uses;
(vi) satisfactorily responds to the constraints on the land;
(vii) will provide further opportunities for residential dwellings in a Rural
zone at a time when there is a significant need for
accommodation;
(viii) has an available water supply;
(ix) has an available waste collection; and
(x) can occur without any unacceptable adverse impacts or unacceptable town
planning consequences.
(b) The relative importance of any established non-compliance with the
provisions of the assessment benchmarks in the context of
the 2018 Douglas Shire
Planning Scheme (version 1.0).
[92] In my view,
these matters, singularly or collectively, do not favour the exercise of the
discretion to approve the proposal in
the face of significant non-compliance
with the assessment benchmarks.
[93] I have
already found that the proposed development does not comply with the Codes when
considered as a whole. For the reasons
outlined above, the proposal does not
comply with the Rural Zone Code or Reconfiguring a Lot Code, even when
considered holistically.
It fails to meet the Rural Zone Code's purpose (ss
6.2.10.2(1)(a)&(c), (2)(a)&(b)) and overall outcomes (s
6.2.10.2(3)(a)&(c)),
as it fragments good quality agricultural land,
limiting proposed lots 2, 3, and 4 to small-scale or hobby uses rather than
areas for primary production like broadacre cropping or animal
husbandry and this is further entrenched by efforts to minimise unavoidable
adverse impacts on the larger proposed lot 1 and the smaller proposed lots 2, 3
and 4, through location of houses, buffers and operational
matters. This
incorporates Strategic Framework provisions (e.g., s 3.6.3.1(1)&(3), s
3.8.4.1(3)) emphasising protection of agricultural
[94] In the
joint planning expert report, Ms. Rayment acknowledges the planning principle of
avoidance of rural land fragmentation
and notes there is a “common
thread” expressed throughout the assessment benchmarks of the planning
scheme for rural
land to protect rural land for primary production. And in her
testimony, she confirmed that “common thread” of avoiding
fragmentation to protect agricultural productivity was a “long-term,
forward planning strategy”. Expert evidence from
Mr. Thompson supports
this, noting the land's suitability for sugarcane, horticulture, or grazing,
which would be permanently alienated
by fragmentation.
proposal also fails the Reconfiguring a Lot Code's purpose (s 9.4.7.2(2)(b)) and
PO1, as the lots lack sufficient area, dimensions,
and shapes for rural uses,
with conditions like buffers further eroding usable land. Dr. Sutherland
conceded the lots are too small
for broadacre cropping. Non-compliance is
fundamental, not resolvable by conditions.
[96] I am not
persuaded that the development is consistent with the surrounding pattern of
development favouring approval of the proposal,
where it further erodes larger
rural holdings in favour of rural residential-style lots, contrary to the
planning scheme's intent
to prevent fragmentation. The land is in the rural
zone, surrounded by a mix of rural (e.g., sugarcane cropping north of Mowbray
River) and rural residential uses (south of Mowbray River Road), but historical
subdivisions east of the site demonstrate the undesirable
outcomes of
fragmentation, including increased reverse amenity conflicts and lots unsuitable
for agriculture. Mr. McClelland expressed
concerns about farming cane near
Mowbray River Road, citing difficulties and potential nuisances for neighbours
(e.g., noise from
machinery, dust, aerial spraying), deeming it not worth the
minimal return.
[97] I accept
Mr. Ovenden’s planning opinion that legacy smaller lots do not justify
further erosion of good quality agricultural
land, when he said in the joint
planning expert report that:
“Legacy rural configurations
in the locality do not justify continued fragmentation of productive rural, good
quality agricultural
land. The historic presence of smaller rural zoned lots
does not provide the basis by which to further erode the remaining rural
The site has been fragmented over time and is one of the remaining larger sized
rural lots in the Shire and approval of this
further reconfiguration means the
area will become less rural and more rural residential in nature”.
[98] Aerial
imagery and site views confirm the land's historical use as a single farming
unit, not fragmented residentially. This
is consistent with the planning
scheme’s long-term strategy which seeks to protect areas of rural land
from such fragmentation
to maintain primary production capacity.
[99] In my view,
the proposal does not satisfactorily respond to the existing and intended
character of the area. The proposal fails
to respond to the area's rural
character in the rural zone, intended to conserve areas of primary production,
by introducing fragmentation
that shifts toward rural residential uses,
undermining the planning scheme's forward planning strategy. The intended
character prioritises
conservation of areas for use for primary production with
good quality agricultural land for long-term agricultural viability, not
subdivision into small lots. Mr. Thompson's evidence highlights the land's
Class A suitability for cropping despite topography,
with features like Seasonal
Creek common and non-alienating in cane farming. Mr. Ovenden emphasised that
fragmentation would erode
the rural character, in these stark terms:
“...it’s not about ... some hypothetical; it’s
saying this is ... a long term challenge facing the rural sector
Shire, as it is most regional council areas, ... and so, don’t fragment
it. Don’t ... waste what is a finite
natural resource, ...by carving it
off, which inevitably will be used for rural lifestyle which is, you know, a big
brick home and
... you know, maybe running a couple of
chooks...”.
[100] I agree
with Mr. Ovenden’s opinion. I do not accept that the proposal maintains
an appropriate use of the land under
the rural zone. Dr. Matthew conceded that
larger lots have greater productivity, and subdivision consumes land via
infrastructure.
Hobby farms, while possible, are "
a bit of fun
primary production; they can occur without subdivision, but would be eroded by
new dwellings. Ms. Rayment’s evidence
underscores that the planning scheme
seeks to protect rural land for primary production, not facilitate uses that
undermine this
purpose. The proposal does not maintain appropriate rural
uses, as it does not conserve areas for use for primary production, and
further fragments good quality agricultural land, limiting useful areas beyond
building envelopes and buffers in lots 2,
3 and 4 to hobby or small-scale
activities. The Rural Zone Code requires protecting all rural uses, including
cropping, animal husbandry,
and horticulture, but the proposal will alienate
parts to cruel the potential for broadacre production.
[101] I think
the proposal is opportunistic, rather than sympathetic, to the land’s
features and topography, and surrounding
development and land uses. The
proposal is unsympathetic to the land's key feature - its good quality
agricultural land and topography
suitable for primary production. While the
land is traversed by natural features like Seasonal Creek, neither the creek nor
vegetative state severs the land but instead it remains joined by existing
crossings to allow farm connectivity so that the land
is so fragmented to
prevent its current and potential rural use as a well-sized area of primary
production. I preferred Mr. Thompson's
evidence, including that such features
are common in regional cane farming. It seems to me that the potential reverse
amenity from
new dwellings on the smaller lots 2, 3 and 4, not mitigated fully
by buffers, will further erode the area for rural production on
lot 1, and the
rural uses on the smaller lots 2, 3 and 4 will be limited and small, and the
need for building envelopes and buffers,
will alienate areas of primary
production from the intended scope of rural uses.
[102] Likewise,
I do not accept that the proposal satisfactorily responds to the constraints on
the land. The proposal fails to respond
to the primary constraint, the good
quality agricultural land as a finite resource of Agricultural Land Class A, by
fragmenting instead
of concentrating such an area of primary production. The
environmental constraints of vegetation and watercourses are overstated;
are not so fragmentary as to alienate the land as discussed above, and I do not
accept that reversion is prohibitive. Buffers
for amenity would further
constrain usable land and underutilise areas of primary production.
[103] While the
proposal will provide further opportunities for residential dwellings at a time
when there is a notorious shortage
of housing in the community generally, there
is no evidence that demonstrates any need for dwellings in a rural zone, and a
community need does not justify non-compliance with rural protection
policies. The contention tends to prioritise rural residential
primary production, a by-product of fragmentation, which is inconsistent with
the zone's primacy to conserve and avoid
fragmentation of areas for use for
primary production.
proposal indeed has an available water supply, but I do see that this favours
approval of the proposal. It seems to me
that the water allocation exists (for
up to 50 hectares for cane irrigation), for the purposes of primary production
and is consistent
with the rural uses intended for the area where primary
production requires good quality agricultural land.
proposal's available waste collection is a neutral fact without basis in
benchmarks and irrelevant to fragmentation harms.
It does not remedy
non-compliance with rural protection.
[106] I do not
accept that the proposal can occur without any unacceptable adverse impacts or
unacceptable town planning consequences.
The proposal causes unacceptable
impacts: permanent good quality agricultural land loss, fragmentation
contributing to cumulative
regional harms (e.g., reduced mill viability, land
conflicts per the Regional Plan), and reverse amenity not fully conditional
4, 7, 85). Planning consequences include broader harm from eroding finite
resources amid industry transitions (e.g., Mossman Mill
closure) (para 4).
[107] As Mr.
Ovenden pointed out in his separate report:
responsible management of land use and development in the Rural zone is critical
to the sustainability of agriculture.
The agricultural sector has to deal with
the vagaries of the state, national and international economic circumstances
together with
other variables such employment challenges and extreme weather
events. Retention of the productive capacity of land and avoidance
fragmentation of GQAL is a fundamental cornerstone of planning for
Queensland’s rural sector. It provides a measure of certainty
against this
uncertain backdrop and secures the finite resource for the long term”.
[108] He further
highlighted that “chipping away” at productivity limits future
options, contributing to a “broader
flow-on effect” of cumulative
impacts. I agree.
[109] Having
regard to the fundamental non-compliance with the provisions of the assessment
benchmarks in the context of the respondent’s
2018 Douglas Shire Planning
Scheme (version 1.0), I am of the view that the non-compliances are significant.
An approach of restraint
is all the more important in the circumstances
currently faced by the agricultural industry in the Douglas Shire as a result of
closure of the Mossman Mill, and the initial phases of the transition from
sugar cane to a more diversified agricultural sector.
The proposal sounds in
the loss of finite areas for use for primary production are conserved and
fragmentation is avoided, which
is further entrenched by the need to minimise
impacts on the new lots through location, design, operation and management.
[110] I do not
accept that all the circumstances of compliance and the other matters urged by
the appellant warrant approval of the
proposal in the exercise of discretion
Planning Act
[111] For these
reasons, I affirm the Council’s refusal of the development application and
dismiss the appeal.
[112] I will
hear from the parties about any other consequential orders consistent with this
