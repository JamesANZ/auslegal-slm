made an application on behalf of the employer under s 218A to vary
the Agreement
in order to correct what are said to be four obvious errors. The Communications,
Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information,
Postal, Plumbing and Allied
Services Union of Australia (CEPU) supports the application and agrees that the
Agreement contains the
four errors identified in the application and that they
should be corrected in the manner proposed. The following corrections are
sought. First, Part A Appendix A clause 2.1(b), and Part B Appendix A clause 2.2

varied to remove
the words ‘at the rate of time and a half for the first
two hours and double time thereafter’ and to replace them with
‘at the rate of double time’. Thirdly, Part A clause 33.3(e) would
be varied so that the number ‘2’
is moved below the line that

weekly all purpose rate +
EW9 weekly all purpose rate’. Fourthly, Part A
clause 34.1(a) would be varied to replace ‘clause 32’ with

referred to above. The variation will
operate from the date of this decision.
On the basis of the material contained in the application and
accompanying declaration, I am satisfied that each of the requirements

The CEPU, being a bargaining representative for the Agreement, has
given notice under s 183 of the Act that it wants the Agreement
