Introduction
26 November 2024, the appellant was arrested on a warrant and charged with the
following offences:
[2] On 30 June
2025, the appellant filed an amended Notice of Appeal against a decision of a
learned Magistrate delivered on 9 May
appellant had been charged with three charges of breaching domestic violence
orders put in place on 7 December 2021. All charges
were brought under
Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 2012
) which provides that a domestic violence order must not be
contravened.
[4] The charges
carry a maximum penalty of 120 penalty units or 3 years imprisonment. One
penalty unit is equivalent to $161.30.
[5] The learned
Magistrate was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt about the matters
concerning charges 1 and 3. As such, those
charges were dismissed. In relation
to charge 2, the learned Magistrate found the appellant guilty and fined him
$750. No conviction
was recorded.
Magistrate found the appellant had breached a domestic violence order because
the content of an email sent to the aggrieved
(his former partner) on 14
September 2024 fell outside of the exception to the non-contact condition of the
protection order.
[7] Pursuant to
the Order made in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia on 19 August
2024, the appellant was not permitted
to contact the aggrieved unless that
the appellant
could contact the aggrieved person via email regarding their three
appellant has appealed the decision in relation to charge 2 .
appellant also seeks leave to rely on the Amended Notice of Appeal.
Matters for Determination – Grounds of appeal
grounds of appeal set out in the Amended Notice of Appeal can be summarised or
grouped as follows:
(a) error of law: the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having
regard to the evidence;
(b) error of fact and law: lack of procedural fairness:
(i) two relevant defences were not considered;
(ii) it was not in the interests of justice to amend the particulars during the
(c) the sentence was manifestly excessive.
Relevant legislation
appeal is brought under s 222(1) of the
Justices Act 1896
(Justices Act).
[12] The powers
of a judge on the hearing of such an appeal are set out in section 225 of the
Justices Act
as follows:
“(1) On the hearing of an
appeal, the judge may confirm, set aside, or vary the appealed order or make any
other order in the
matter the judge considers just.
(2) If the judge sets aside an order, the judge may send the proceeding
with directions of
any kind for the further conduct of the proceedings including, for example,
directions for rehearing or reconsideration.
subsection (1),
the judge may exercise any power that could
have been exercised by whoever made the order appealed against.
(4) An order made under
subsection (1)
has effect, and may be
enforced in the same way, as if it had been made by whoever made the appealed
[13] On appeal,
the onus is on the appellant to demonstrate that there has been some legal,
factual, or discretionary error made by
determining whether the learned Magistrate has erred, it is important to keep in
mind the words of the High Court in relation
to discretionary decisions in
House v The King
[1936] HCA 40
“It is not enough that the judges composing the
appellate Court consider that, if they have been the position of the primary
judge, they would take a different course.”
[15] It must be
shown that there has been some error either in acting upon irrelevant matters or
failing to take into account a material
consideration.
Two requests for leave to amend Notice of Appeal
to the hearing, the appellant sought leave to rely on an Amended Notice of
Appeal. The respondent did not oppose this application
and in fact submitted
leave should be granted. As there is no apparent prejudice to the respondent,
leave to amend the Notice of
Appeal is granted.
[17] At the
hearing, the appellant, represented by Mr Morris KC, sought to raise a new
ground of appeal, namely that the charge was
bad for latent, or patent,
[18] This was
not raised in the hearing below. As will become apparent, that is
understandable.
respondent neither consented nor objected to the late ground of appeal.
[20] In addition
to the length of the delay in raising a new ground of appeal, other factors to
be considered in determining whether
to exercise the discretion in favour of
extending the time by which a Notice of Appeal can be lodged
(a) any prejudice to the first respondent; and
(b) whether it is in the interests of justice to grant the extension.
duplicity argument is as follows. The prosecution case was that the appellant
could have been convicted in relation to any
one of a possible thirty-five plus
emails in which he was said to have breached the protection order in
(a) the defendant used a different email address other than the one he had been
requested to use (I note the appellant says this
was not a term of the order);
(b) the contents of the emails were outside the permissible scope of the order
in that he discussed matters “
” child support.
[22] The learned
Magistrate rejected the contention that the appellant could not communicate with
his former spouse about child support.
The appellant contends it was therefore
unclear what else may have been relied upon by the respondent. Despite
requesting particulars
of the charge, they were provided late, and further,
amended during the second day of the trial. At that stage, prosecution witnesses
had already been called and cross-examined. The late amendment to the
particulars introduced an additional “new” basis
for a breach by
introducing the allegation that the appellant had contravened the obligation to
be of good behaviour in paragraph
1 of the domestic violence order.
[23] The learned
Magistrate permitted the amendment.
[24] The effect
of the amendment to charge 2 was, as submitted by Mr Morris KC, to turn a charge
which is specific as to a non-compliance
with one condition to a duplex charge
which covers either a breach of term 1 or a breach of term 4.
particular of that breach was provided in advance of the hearing.
[26] The rule
against duplicity is that a person cannot allege more than one offence in a
single charge on an indictment. Latent duplicity
refers to uncertainty or
ambiguity in the charge such that the defendant does not know what is
The principle developed at
common law is one of providing procedural
[27] There are
exceptions to the rule. In
Walsh v Tattersall
[1996] HCA 26
at 112, Kirby J notes that the exception to the rule has been
(a) where the multiple acts relied on are so close in time and place that they
can be viewed as one composite activity; and
(b) where the offence is one that can be classified as continuing in nature.
[2] Kirby J held
a strict approach to duplicity should be maintained.
[28] At the
hearing, I asked the respondent if they wanted time to make submissions on the
duplicity ground and the answer was no.
Despite this, a week after the hearing,
without leave, the respondent sent the Court a copy of the decision of
Garget-Bennett
[2010] QCA 231
[2013] 1 Qd R 547
Garget-Bennett
) and a copy of a transcript of the special leave hearing
where the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions applied for special
to appeal from the orders of the Court of Appeal in
Garget-Bennett
. No accompanying submissions were provided. I do not
propose to concern myself with the special leave transcript and it is not
to me why there is any need to review the decision of
Garget-Bennett
, other than for a statement of general principle.
[29] In my view,
there is some merit to the duplicity argument. Therefore, leave is granted to
raise the new ground of appeal. However,
given my decision to set aside the
conviction for procedural fairness reasons, I do not need to form a final view
on this point.
Consideration
referred to above, charges 1 and 3 were dismissed. The appellant was acquitted
of charge 1 and charge 3 was the subject of
a successful no case submission by
the appellant’s counsel.
[31] I have
several concerns about how this matter proceeded.
[32] What one
first notices is that the three charges are identical save for the dates. No
particulars of the charges were initially
provided to the appellant. The
appellant sought particulars. On 7 May 2025 in the evening before the trial
commenced, the appellant
was provided with the requested particulars.
particulars provided in relation to charge 2 were as follows:
[34] Not only
were the particulars late, but they are also lacking in sufficient particularity
as is discussed further below.
[35] It is an
understatement that providing particulars on the eve of trial, 5 months from the
date of charge, was extremely late
and unacceptable. At the outset of the
hearing, then Counsel for the appellant, requested an adjournment because of the
of service of particulars, and the failure of the prosecution to
provide a witness list or exhibit list. There was also a late suggestion
witness giving evidence by way of special measures for which the appellant had
been given no supporting information to consider
his position. Counsel informed
the learned Magistrate of these failings and that some requests had been made a
week ago. The learned
Magistrate was informed these matters were relevant to
cross-examination. In relation to the late application for special measure,
learned Magistrate was also informed that this application, unsupported by
affidavit evidence, was also opposed. His Honour granted
the special measures
application with insufficient reasons.
[36] In response
to why everything had been delayed or not disclosed, the Sergeant conducting the
matter on the part of the respondent
KAY:...unfortunately, the prosecution who had carriage of this matter has gone
sick today, so I’ve been handed this
file this morning, so I don’t
know a lot of the background. I’ve read what I can this morning, and
I’ve spoken
to the witnesses this morning.”
Sergeant could not provide any answers or explanations for the appellant’s
concerns or to counter the adjournment request.
The learned Magistrate said to
Ms Bernardin, “
which makes me all the more curious why you want an
adjournment at all if you’ve got someone on the back
With respect, Ms
Bernadin’s concern was her own client being on the back foot.
[38] In these
circumstances it was, in my view, procedurally unfair not to have granted the
adjournment. The learned Magistrate, clearly
trying to keep the matter afloat,
and noting he was “stuck with
decided to proceed and
decide as it went along. This path, although an attempt not to cause undue
delay, was fraught.
learned Magistrate proceeded to hear the matter. Ms Bernadin again called for
confirmation of the particulars in relation
to charge 3 to ensure everyone was
“on the same page”.
proceedings should have been stayed pending the provision of the
particulars.
[40] The accused
should have been provided with particulars and disclosure so that he knew
precisely what was alleged. As was pointed
out by the English Court of Appeal in
[1981] 1 All ER
[1981] 1 WLR 355
, there is a very
good reasons why particulars need to be given in
“...to stop the prosecution shifting their ground
during the course of the case without the leave of the trial judge and the
making of an amendment.”
[41] See also
Gleeson CJ in
Goldsmith v Sandilands
[2002] HCA 31
(2002) 190 ALR
“The function of particulars is not to expand the
issues ... but “to fill in the picture ... with information sufficiently
detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to
enable him to prepare for trial.”
[42] Despite Ms
Bernadin requesting clarity, given that the adjournment request had been denied,
the learned Magistrate said, “
the particulars can be changed at any
The following
exchange then
BERNADIN: Out of fairness, they should be established at the start of the trial
before the evidence is called.”
[43] Then, the
anticipated issue arose. On the second day of the trial, the prosecution sought
to add an additional particular to
charge 2 after the evidence of witnesses and
cross-examination had already occurred. Ms Bernadin made known her opposition to
particulars being changed part way through the trial. The following exchange
BERNARDIN: I am opposed to the particulars being changed now part way through
the trial because - - -
HIS HONOUR: Well, the particulars can be changed at any point, and the
evidence has come out as to the order. I don’t think
you can be taken by
surprise, but I’ll hear your submissions on it.
MS BERNARDIN: They can, of course, be changed during the trial. It was
specifically requested by the prosecution that they articulate
exactly what
—and the prosecutor’s specifically put on the record it was alleged
that it was a breach of a good behaviour
condition before your Honour and - -
[44] Ms Bernadin
again pleaded that these late changes were unfortunate for the defence.
[45] The learned
Magistrate allowed the late addition to the particulars. One of the outcomes of
permitting the late addition to the
particulars was to expand the issues, which,
as referred to above, is not the function of particulars. The additional
also raises the issue of duplicity and should have been the subject
of a separate charge.
[46] In my view
this was a denial of procedural fairness. The adjournment should have been
granted. Provision is made in section 573
Criminal Code 1899
for an adjournment to be granted if a Court considers particulars are
[47] The learned
Magistrate erred in exercising the discretion to not grant an adjournment. It is
unjust to expect an accused to properly
prepare and instruct counsel on the run
in what was a moveable feast of allegations. It is not for the accused to
determine what
case it is that is being run against him.
[48] Public
interest in efficient disposition of cases is of course relevant, but it cannot
come at the expense of an accused having
a proper opportunity to present their
case. The adjournment request was only for a matter of days to ensure the
accused had proper
particulars, full disclosure, and material with which he
could consider the special measures request. There would have been no injustice
to the prosecution from a short delay, particularly where the cause of the delay
was its own failure to attend to necessary steps.
[49] In these
circumstances, I am going to set aside the conviction and send the proceeding
[50] It is not
appropriate in my view in the circumstances to traverse the other grounds of
[51] I will hear
the parties as to appropriate directions.
