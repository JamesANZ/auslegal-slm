Nolan, Justine --- "Editorial" [2007] HRightsDef 11; (2007) 16(2) Human Rights Defender 1
Justine Nolan
The oft uncomfortable and complex relationship between human
rights and religion is the primary focus of this edition of the Human
Defender. The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights refers
to human rights as ‘the basic rights
and freedoms to which all humans are
entitled’ and specifically provides for the right to freedom of religion,
including the
freedom to change one’s religion or belief, and freedom,
either alone or in community with others and in public or private,
to manifest
one’s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.
Although this right was then legalised
by the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights the debate about how fundamental human rights and religion
and when one right might be prioritized over another, continues to
Danielle Celermajer’s thought provoking article provides a solid base
for an opening examination of this topic. As Celermajer
points out, many
authoritative interpretations of religious texts and prominent religious
doctrines prescribe norms that directly
contravene human rights standards,
particularly those relating to women.
The challenge is achieving the requisite compromise in order to permit the
coexistence of religion and human rights.
The articles that follow highlight particular complexities that flow from the
vexed interaction between human rights and religion.
Carolyn Evans and Beth Gaze
examine the relationship between religious freedom and non-discrimination laws
and consider whether rights
can or should trump one or the other. Article 18(3)
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights specifically allows
for limitations on freedom of religion provided that they are prescribed by law
and are necessary to protect public safety, order,
health, morals or the
fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Andrew Lynch considers this in the
context of Australia’s
anti-terrorism laws, specifically, whether they are
discriminatory towards Muslims in Australia. One of the most prominent clashes
between religion and rights is the perception that religious practices are
discriminatory toward women. Holly Lam focuses exclusively
on this issue and the
disconnection between the apparent desire of religious beliefs to promote
tolerance while exhibiting an obvious
disconnect between such beliefs and
practice. This disconnect is exemplified even further when contemplating the
nexus between religion
and the environment. Lesa-Belle Furhagen addresses the
question of whether religion can or should play a significant role in guiding
environmental stewardship and concludes that the environmental crisis is also a
spiritual one, which requires among other solutions,
a spiritual solution that
cannot be confined to a single faith tradition.
The remaining articles consider three diverse but contemporary topics within
human rights: the reform of the United Nations, environmental
challenges to
human rights protection, and the operation of human rights in China. The new
United Nations Human Rights Council (which
succeeded the oft criticised Human
Rights Commission) met for the first time in July 2006. As Tony Morris notes,
some have heralded
its establishment as a ‘New Chapter for Human
Rights’. His article examines the Human Rights Council one year on and
considers whether its practices are going to be equal to its promises.
As the former next President of the United States commented at the launch of
the ‘Live Earth’ concerts earlier this year,
the environment is the
issue of our and future generations. Environmental issues pose unique challenges
to human rights, in particular
the issue of the physical, economic and cultural
security of our Pacific neighbours. In May 2007, Peter Garrett spoke at a
hosted by the Australian Human Rights Centre at the University of NSW.
This article provides a transcript of Garrett’s speech
and highlights his
concern with developing a long term strategy for dealing with ‘climate
change refugees’.
Finally, Ben Lumsdaine provides an insight into how human rights are
perceived by the younger generation in China. In November 2006,
five UNSW law
students selected by the Australian Human Rights Centre at the invitation of the
Australian Human Rights and Equal
Opportunity Commission, travelled to Chengdu,
China to take part in the Chinese National Model United Nations Conference.
an obviously uneasy relationship with many human rights and
Lumsdaine’s experience at this university conference in China provides
hopeful insight into the increasing engagement of China’s younger
generation with human rights.
We would particularly like to thank Holly Lam (student editor, intern) for
her contribution to this edition and welcome Luke Taylor
as the incoming student
We hope that you enjoy reading this issue of the Human Rights Defender.
