Graw, Stephen --- "Preface" [2023] JCULawRw 1; (2023) 29 James Cook University Law Review i
The signature legal event for 2023 was, without doubt, the referendum on
October seeking approval for an amendment to the Australian
Constitution
to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to parliament, fulfilling an
undertaking made by Prime Minister Albanese on the election of his Labor
government in May 2022.
In this year’s annual Mayo Lecture, Dr Bryan Keon-Cohen AM KC, a key
figure in the
in 1992, examines the backgrounds, motivation and
conduct of the main players in that case – individuals, communities, and
governments
– both before and during it, and explores how the referendum,
and Voice, Treaty, Truth reforms, could have assisted to resolve
many of the
issues that arose then, and which continue as challenges today. As his lecture
was delivered before the date of the referendum
the paper now also includes a
postscript, reflecting on the possible consequences of that failure and
considering how the issues
that were to have been addressed through the Voice
can now be best progressed.
In a paper initially presented as part of JCU’s Law Seminar Series,
Justin Greggery KC, Counsel Assisting the Royal Commission
into the Robodebt
Scheme, continues with the justice theme by discussing the Commission’s
examination of a debt assessment
and recovery system that controversially, and
unlawfully, claimed nearly $2 billion in ‘overpaid’ social security
entitlements
from over 400,000 individuals. He notes that the Commission’s
recommendations were ‘directed to key failings in the systems
structures which were overcome by the willingness of individuals to circumvent
the existing checks and balances’ and that
they are ‘no doubt ...
under active consideration by the government’.
Government process failures are also the subject of Bede Harris’ paper.
It discusses pork-barrelling in Australia, the inadequacy
of legal remedies to
prevent it and how constitutional protection of socioeconomic rights could
provide an avenue for suppression
of the practice. He notes that courts in South
Africa have interpreted socioeconomic rights provisions in that country’s
Constitution
to require that government funding of socioeconomic programmes be
allocated in accordance with a standard of reasonableness –
created novel remedies to require the executive to revise how funds are
distributed when that standard has been breached.
He concludes that, if similar
rights were protected in the Australian
Constitution
, that ‘would
constitute a powerful disincentive against governments using public funds for
political purposes.’
Dr Tom Middleton continues the governmental theme by examining ASIC’s
administrative power under
Corporations Act 2001
to disqualify persons from managing a corporation for up to five years. He
argues that, while it is intended to assist ASIC
to achieve its regulatory
objectives of protecting and promoting the confidence of Australian business
participants and enforcing
the corporations legislation efficiently and
cost-effectively, the section is not as effective as it could be – largely
of uncertainties in the interpretation of its language. He concludes
should be redrafted to provide ASIC with a clearer and more
efficient and effective disqualification power.
Chris Davies’ paper on women’s sport and the law moves the
direction of discussion to individual rights. With the continuing
women’s sport at national and international levels a number of legal
issues have emerged, including in relation to
player contracts, equal pay, draft
systems, labour market controls and discrimination, the implications of all of
which are discussed
in the paper.
Individual rights are also the subject of Karnika Bansal’s paper,
although in the context of performers’ rights under
the situation with other ‘authors’, including lyricists, composers,
and production companies, performers
do not receive equivalent property rights
and that hinders their recognition and protection. The paper considers existing
and suggests that there is a case for recognition of co-authorship
rights for performers.
Moving from individual rights to group rights Dr Daniel Lavery’s paper
examines whether native title is proprietary in nature.
A Full Federal Court
decision in May 2023 determined that native title is more than a mere
‘bundle of rights’. It is,
instead, ‘property’ within
the terms of
Constitution
. Special leave to appeal that
decision to the High Court was granted on 19 October 2023 and the appeal is
scheduled to be heard in
Darwin in August 2024. The paper considers the Full
Federal Court’s decision and the issues that are likely to be argued on
the appeal.
Finally, Chris Davies and Neil Dunbar consider two cases with clear
significance for contracts between sporting clubs –
Leeds United
Football Club Limited v RasenBallsport Leipzig GmbH
Cardiff City
Football Club Limited v SASP Football Club de Nantes.
Both involved disputes
over financial liability under player transfer agreements that did not pan out
as at least one of the parties
in each case had intended. Given the amounts
involved, they demonstrate the need for careful planning.
As a closing note, the Editorial Board would also like to record, formally,
our gratitude to all of the contributors to this 29
volume of the
JCULR. The varied subject areas covered are, once again, a testament to the
diversity of legal scholarship. We would
also like to express our thanks to our
reviewers whose comments provided the authors with such valuable guidance. We
thank them all.
