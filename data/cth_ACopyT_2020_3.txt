parties confer and propose to the Tribunal an agreed order so as to facilitate

Mr Regattieri’s affidavits within seven
REASONS FOR
DETERMINATION
PERRAM J (DEPUTY PRESIDENT):
the Applicant served three affidavits which it says are in reply. The
affidavits are:
(1) Ms Haddock of 14 July 2020;
(2) Mr Regattieri of 9 July 2020; and
(3) Ms Causley-Todd of 9 July 2020.
Respondents submit (a) that the affidavits are not in reply and should not be
received. It seeks a ruling in advance of the hearing
to this effect. The
hearing commences on Monday 7 September 2020 and is due to run for three
weeks. They then submit (b) that the
affidavits should not be received because
they will be of no assistance to the Tribunal in the resolution of the issues.
submit (c) that the receipt of the affidavits will be prejudicial
because their form is such that they cannot be properly answered.
Tacking back
in the other direction the Respondents submit (d) that if the affidavits are
received then the Respondents must be
given an opportunity to respond to them.
Finally, the Respondents submit (e) that the affidavits should not be permitted
the deponents are the Applicant’s lawyers. Permitting the
Applicant’s lawyers to be cross-examined may put them in the
position of having to give answers contrary to their client’s interests.
These issues arose in the context of the
Applicant’s application for the
suppression of certain exhibits to the affidavits. Such an order is no longer
sought by the
is not a Court case and the rules of evidence and procedure do not apply. The
Tribunal’s principal obligation in the present
context is to ensure that
both parties are given procedural fairness. Viewed that way, I will deal with
propositions (a), (b) and
(c) together by asking whether it is procedurally fair
for the Applicant to rely on the affidavits and, if it is, does procedural
fairness require the Respondents to be given a chance to respond (proposition
(d)). I reject proposition (e). Maybe that problem
will arise, maybe it will
not. Witnesses in various proceedings are sometimes put in tricky situations
where the penalty for perjury
interacts uncomfortably with their other duties or
obligations. There is nothing unusual about it. No doubt, most solicitors
in contentious business try to keep themselves out of the witness box
on substantive issues, but that is a counsel of wisdom not
a rule of law.
then to the three affidavits, one must first ask what they are to prove. There
is an issue between the Applicant and the
Respondents about the extent to which
students are provided by the Respondents with material by email and other
platforms (in addition
to learning management systems). The Applicant wishes to
show that this does actually happen and therefore to put itself in a better
position when it comes to assessing how much the Respondents are using the
material and therefore, potentially, the appropriate fee.
In its case in chief,
it put on an affidavit from its chief executive, Mr Suckling, on this
topic. That affidavit was cast in somewhat
general terms.
Respondents, by contrast, have the opposite incentive. They wish to show that
the provision of copyright material to students
by the Respondents is less than
in the picture painted by the Applicant. They have put on a number of
affidavits to push the evidence
in this direction. For example, the Associate
Director, Teaching and Research, Information Services, at the Royal Melbourne
of Technology (‘RMIT’) (one of the Respondents) is
Ms Lennox. Ms Lennox has sworn an affidavit which is to be relied
by the Respondents to prove that:
Academics at
RMIT are prohibited from uploading statutory licence content directly onto
RMIT’s learning management system;
She has never
encountered once in twenty years the practice of academics emailing materials to
students; and
Most of the
images which are used in lecture slides and notes are released under a creative
commons license and are not usually statutory
licence content.
witnesses for the Respondents give evidence of the same kind. The Applicant
says it is entitled to reply to this evidence by
pointing to some real life
examples. The affidavits of Ms Haddock, Ms Causley-Todd and
Mr Regattieri are for this purpose. Ms Haddock,
Ms Causley-Todd
and Mr Regattieri are all employees of Banki Haddock Fiora who are the
solicitors for the Applicant. Ms Causley-Todd
is employed as a lawyer.
Her evidence relates to her studies between March 2014 and August 2019
at the University of New South Wales
(‘UNSW’). She explains that
during her studies at UNSW that readings for some of her courses were uploaded
to a learning
management system called Moodle as PDF documents although in other
courses she was encouraged to purchase books (particularly in
relation to her
studies in English). Sometimes she received a course pack which was a bundle of
documents stapled together. There
were also handouts at tutorials.
Ms Causley-Todd gives much more evidence of this kind.
Mr Regattieri
is awaiting the awarding of his degree (as I understand it) and is working as
graduand prior to his admission. He gives
evidence about his time at the
University of Technology, Sydney (‘UTS’) where he studied. His
evidence is similar in
kind to Ms Causley-Todd’s.
is a partner at Banki Haddock Fiora. From 2012 to 2017 Ms Haddock
completed a Master of Arts at the University of Sydney.
Her affidavit of
14 July 2020 attaches an exhibit which contains a bundle of emails and
course readings she received in the course
of her studies. Ms Haddock also
gives evidence that sometimes materials would be provided by lecturers to her in
is a risk in the present context of over-engineering. Neither party is going to
establish what the actual amount of copyright
material used is. At the end of
the day the evidence is going to show some copyright material is uploaded to
learning managements
systems, that some is copied as photocopied course handouts
and that there are rules in place in some universities designed to reduce
as possible the use of copyright materials. It is difficult to see that this
statement will be improved on at the hearing.
Just what the Tribunal will do
with this information lies in the future.
see no harm in receiving the material but I do accept that the Respondents
should have a chance to respond to it if they wish.
Specifically, the
Respondents should have an opportunity to put on evidence from the University of
Sydney, UNSW and UTS contradicting
or qualifying the evidence of
Ms Haddock, Ms Causley-Todd and Mr Regattieri as to their
experience as students.
only orders I will make is to dismiss the Respondents’ application for an
advance ruling. The parties should confer and
propose to the Tribunal an agreed
order so as to facilitate the putting on of evidence by the University of
Sydney, UNSW and UTS
in response to Ms Haddock’s,
Ms Causley-Todd’s and Mr Regattieri’s affidavits within
