Introduction
Over 90 per cent of the world’s prisoners are men (Warmsley 2016).
over-representation of men in prison has long been known, their gender has
typically been ‘backgrounded’. Given the relational
character of
gender and the homosocial and intensely hierarchical nature of the prison, the
study of prison gender identities holds
promise in making unique theoretical and
empirical contributions to gender studies, criminology and feminist projects.
New Perspectives on Prison Masculinities
is significant as it has been
17 years since a publication — the influential
Prison Masculinities
edited by Sabo, Kupers and London (2001) — has brought together such a
varied collection of works that examine the gendered
experience of men
prisoners. It thus provides an opportunity to reflect on how this topic is
currently approached empirically and
conceptually.
Overview of the book
The book is an edited collection of 13 chapters that draws mostly from
qualitative ethnographic data. Collectively, the book serves
up examinations of
a range of engaging issues: fake tanning creams that enact health and connection
to pre-prison lives (Maycock);
medieval tropes that reveal how prison experience
aligns with masculine projects in wider society (Earle); ‘street
and spiritual conversion that help elucidate a black masculinities
and desistance framework (Glyn); and the contradiction inherent
to a parenting
program which privileges personal responsibility while overlooking a
prison’s denial of prisoner agency (Curtis).
Notwithstanding that the
works are mostly confined to viewpoints from the United Kingdom and heterosexual
cisgender men, through
engagement of issues such as ‘race’, labour,
feminism, embodiment, and neoliberalism, the book illustrates the varied
empirically rich developments made since
Prison Masculinities
Theoretical approaches to understanding prison masculinities
Introducing the book, Maycock positions the volume within recent theoretical
developments in masculinity studies, namely Anderson’s
(2009) inclusive
masculinity theory. In doing so, the book is differentiated from
Masculinities
(Sabo et al. 2001), which Maycock states focused on the
‘ultramasculine’ and came to be readily interpreted through Raewyn
Connell’s influential concept, hegemonic masculinity (1987, 1995, 2005).
Hegemonic masculinity has been broadly understood
as a pattern of practice
relationally informed by normative male behavioural ideals in a particular
culture at a particular period
in time. This ideal exalts a masculinity that is
dependent on the complicity and subordination of women and of other men who are
seen to inhabit marginalised masculinities (for example, gay, queer and
‘effete’ men) (Connell & Messerschmidt
2005; Connell 1995
Boise 2014). Hegemonic masculinity has attracted a range of criticisms including
that it is transhistorical and tends to be referred
to as a fixed trait or type
of negative masculinity (Martin 1998; Connell & Messerschmidt 2005, p. 839)
and thus, it is claimed,
has become unable to account for the diverse, nuanced
and more ‘positive’ contemporary masculinities documented in the
last decade or two (Beasley 2008; Anderson & McCormack 2016). In response,
Anderson (2009) advised it was time ‘other’
men’s experiences
were investigated and theorised. These criticisms and Anderson’s inclusive
masculinity concept (Anderson
2009; Anderson & McCormack 2016) centrally
inform Maycock’s rationale and framing of the book. While this sets up a
premise for the book, engagement with the criticisms directed at
inclusive masculinity among those who both reference and draw from
would strengthen the book. The prison provides a ripe context to facilitate
Inclusive masculinity theory has been criticised
for its central premise that homophobia and ‘homo-hysteria’ (the
of being socially perceived as ‘gay’: Anderson & McCormack
2016) is declining in some cultures which thus allows
men to express more
diverse and inclusive masculinities that are not dependent on their anxieties
surrounding gay and bisexual men
(Anderson 2009; Anderson & McCormack 2016;
Martino 2011). Although homophobia may have decreased in specific forms in
cultures and locales, to claim it has decreased in the prison culture
and systems is difficult, as prison-based research attests
(Kupers 2010; Lara
2010; Simpson et al. 2014). Homophobic talk and attitudes were evident in
several studies in this book. Maycock,
in discussing his findings (Chapter 4),
states ‘that it may be more appropriate to recognise not a decline, but
rather a specific
manifestation of homo-hysteria in prison contexts’ (p.
84). Discussion on how this problematises Maycock’s rapport with
masculinities and its application to a prison context would have been
beneficial.
Di Viggiana (Chapter 5) examines how both
relations among and
between prisoners and prison staff and larger
institutional
practices of
the prison and wider society orientate prisoners and staff towards hegemonic
organising principles that reflect a heterosexist
masculine ideology. Such work
illustrates how prison masculinities problematise inclusive masculinities’
view of hegemony.
While proponents of Anderson’s theory claim that
inclusive masculinities reflect and facilitate the end of hegemony, others
they may at best disrupt hegemony at a group level only (what Demetriou 2001
refers to as ‘internal hegemony’)
and leaves institutional practices
(‘external hegemony’: Demetriou 2001) untouched. As such, the
broader structural inequalities
and hidden prejudices that continue to provide
institutional privileges to some groups of men (de Boise 2014, p. 325), and
social disadvantage and pathways to incarceration for others, remain
intact. Di Viggiana’s contribution shows that if it is
difficult to claim
a declining internal hegemony (homophobia) in prison, it is even harder to claim
a decline in external hegemony
(institutional practices of prison and beyond).
Crewe and Morey (Chapter 2) illustrate complex identity work in relation to
attitudes to work that for many disrupt the stereotype
‘hardened’ male prisoner. This disruption is interpreted cursorily
through reference to how such prison masculinities
have moved away from the
hypermasculine characterisation ‘described in a previous era’ (p.
39). Market-led social change,
mediated through a desire by some disadvantaged
men to conspicuously consume status markers (for example, branded clothes, body
and leisure activities), and inclusive masculinity theory are discussed
earlier in the chapter to evoke sense of this progressive
shift. Inclusive
masculinity theory has come under fire for is its lack of engagement and
complicity in reproducing postfeminist
logics that account for, yet erase,
feminist histories and sexual politics through an optimistic and
‘uncomplicated narrative’
of inevitable ‘progressive social
change’ (O’Neill 2014, p. 111). While moving away from
hypermasculinity is something
to be hopeful about, a lack of engagement in the
ways social histories may have contributed to such a shift is likely to foster
understandings
and perspectives of masculinities, prison-based or not, that are
This is a thought-provoking, empirically rich book that makes an important
contribution towards describing and bringing attention
to the impacts and
dilemmas of incarcerated men and the enactment of prisoners’
masculinities. Like prisoner masculinity studies
in recent years, the book is
perhaps more nuanced at describing prison masculinities than theorising them,
and as such is less critically
engaged with wider theoretical debates in
masculinity and gender studies. Although the book to a degree is coupled to
recent theoretical
developments in masculinity studies, its uncritical
engagement with the idea of inclusive masculinity risks diminishing its
application
to a catchall phrase to reference various talk and behaviours that
do not align with the male prisoner stereotype of the toxic ultramasculine
(de Boise 2014). Notwithstanding, many of the contributors make interesting use
of diverse literatures, disciplines and theories,
ensuring the book is an
important resource for scholars and those interested in the lives and wellbeing
of prisoners.
