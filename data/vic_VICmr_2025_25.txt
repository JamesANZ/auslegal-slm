Agency’s decision letter sets out the reasons for its
Review application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under section 49A(1) of
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section

have examined a copy of the documents subject to review and considered relevant
communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
Review of exemption
Section 38 - Documents to which secrecy provisions of enactments
38 provides:
38 Documents to which secrecy provisions of
enactments apply
A document is an exempt document if there is in force an enactment applying
specifically to information of a kind contained in the
document and prohibiting
persons referred to in the enactment from disclosing information of that kind,
whether the prohibition is
absolute or is subject to exceptions or
qualifications.
for a document to be exempt under section 38, three conditions must be
(a) there must be an enactment in force;
(b) the enactment must be formulated with such precision that it specifies the
actual information prohibited from disclosure in the
document; and
(c) the enactment must prohibit persons referred to in the enactment from
disclosing the specific kind of information in the document
(either absolutely
or subject to exceptions or qualifications).
Is there an enactment in force?
am satisfied the TZV Act is an enactment in force for the purposes of section 38
of the FOI Act.
Does the enactment apply specifically to the kind
of information in the documents?
section 38 to apply to an enactment, the enactment must be formulated with such
precision that it specifies the actual information
sought to be withheld.
Agency relies on section 63 of the TZV Act to refuse access to the documents.
This provision states in part:
63 Confidentiality
(1) A person must not make a record of, use or disclose to any person, any
confidential information that is acquired in the performance
of the person's
functions or the exercise of the person's powers under this Act.
Penalty: 60 penalty units.
63(3) of the TSV Act defines ‘confidential information’ for the
purposes of section 63 as:
...any information in relation to call
taking and dispatch services or operational communications services provided by
Triple Zero
4 of the TSV Act defines ‘call taking and dispatch services’
(a) taking, listening to and recording calls in which assistance is sought from
an emergency services organisation or a related services
organisation by—
(i) a member of the public; or
(ii) a member of an emergency services organisation; or
(iii) a member of a related services organisation; and
(b) communicating the information received in calls referred to in paragraph (a)
to the relevant emergency services organisation
or the relevant related services
organisation designated to respond to the call and recording any such
communication of information.
am satisfied the TSV Act identifies the information to which the secrecy
provision applies with sufficient precision for the purposes
of section 38 of
the FOI Act.
this matter, the documents relate to an audio recording of dispatch radio
between Agency officers and members of emergency services
organisations, and an
associated written chronology of events.
am satisfied both documents relate to ‘call taking or dispatch
services’ for the purposes of the TZV Act.
Accordingly,
I am satisfied the information in these documents constitutes
‘confidential information’.
Does the enactment
prohibit persons from disclosing the information in the documents?
am satisfied section 63(1) of the TZV Act prohibits specific persons from
disclosing the specified information, being information
relating to call taking
or dispatch services.
Do any of the exceptions set out in section
63(2) of the TZV Act apply?
63(2) of the TZV Act sets out circumstances in which the prohibition under
section 63(1) of the TZV Act does not apply.
63(2) of the TZV Act provides:
Subsection (1) does not apply if
(a) the making of the record, use or disclosure of the confidential information
is necessary for the purposes of, or in connection
with, the performance of the
person’s functions or exercise of the person’s powers under this
(b) the making of the record, use or disclosure of the confidential information
is authorised by this Act or any other Act; or
(c) the disclosure of the confidential information is made to an Ombudsman
officer within the meaning of the
Ombudsman Act 1973
(d) the person to whom the confidential information relates gives written
consent to the making of the record, use or disclosure
of the information; or
(e) the disclosure of the confidential information is made to a court in the
course of a criminal proceeding or any other proceeding
under this Act or any
other Act; or
(f) the disclosure of the confidential information is made with the written
authority of the Minister.
Applicant requires the information to better understand the circumstances of an
incident in which [a family member] was involved
in a collision while responding
to an emergency. The Applicant has submitted that both occupants of the fire
appliance involved in
the incident are willing to provide statements consenting
to disclosure of information that relates to them.
have considered whether section 63(2)(d) of the TZV Act would apply to excerpt
parts of the audio recording that relate directly
to the incident requested by
the Applicant, being:
communication audio on channel [number] between [codename] and [codename].
Agency submits that:
as unit numbers and
codes are used, rather than names, [the Agency] is unable to identify any of the
third parties in the audio recording
and therefore cannot obtain consent of
third parties to the release of the recording.
Applicant requested further enquiries be made to the Agency as they were of the
...All emergency responses attended by CFA appliances are
recorded on [Fire and Incident Reporting System] FIRS and uploaded to a
crew details for every callout, including names.
In this case, the record will
show that the two occupants of the fire appliance were [named person] and [named
In addition, this information would also be accessible through the Victoria
Police report relating to the collision, which again documents
the names of both
response, the Agency advised that it does not have access to the FIRS database
or the Victoria Police report referred to.
the Agency is unable to identify the third party individuals relating to the
codenames ‘[codename]’ and ‘[codename]’,
I am satisfied
the Agency cannot obtain the necessary written consent to disclosure of the
information, and therefore this exception
under section 63(2)(d) of the TZV Act
does not apply.
Summary of section 38 assessment
am satisfied:
(a) the TSV Act is an enactment in force;
(b) the TSV Act describes with sufficient precision the information that appears
in the documents subject to review;
(c) the TSV Act prohibits persons from disclosing the information in the
I am satisfied that no exceptions apply, I have determined the documents are
exempt under section 38.
appreciate this is an important matter for the Applicant and their [family
member] and this is not the outcome they seek. However,
I do not have discretion
to release the requested documents under the FOI Act where, as in this case, I
find they are documents to
which a secrecy provision of an enactment applies.
Section 25 – Deletion of exempt or irrelevant
information
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
Determining
what is ‘practicable’ requires consideration of the effort and
editing involved in making the deletions and
the effectiveness of the deletions.
Where deletions would render a document meaningless, they are not
‘practicable’ and
release of the document is not required under
section 25.
have considered the effect of deleting exempt information from the documents. In
my view, it is not practicable for the Agency to
delete the exempt information,
because doing so would render the documents
meaningless.
the information before me, I am satisfied the documents are exempt from release
under section 3 in conjunction with section 63
of the TZV Act.
I am satisfied that it is not practicable to provide the Applicant with an
edited copy of the documents with exempt information
deleted in accordance with
section 25, access is refused in full.
Timeframe to seek a review
of my decision
the Applicant is not satisfied with my decision, they are entitled to apply to
VCAT for it to be reviewed.
Applicant may apply to VCAT for a review up to 60 days from the date they are
given this Notice of Decision.

Alternatively, VCAT may be contacted by email at
admin@vcat.vic.gov.au or by
telephone on 1300 018 228.
Agency is required to notify the Information Commissioner in writing as soon as
practicable if it is advised the Applicant has
