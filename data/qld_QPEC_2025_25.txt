TABLE OF CONTENTS
Introduction
[1] This is a
submitter appeal against Council’s decision to grant a development permit
authorising the Co-respondent, Cielo
Property Group Pty Ltd, to make a material
change of use of land at 90-92 Pacific Parade, Bilinga (“
the subject
”) to establish a 10-storey residential apartment building
containing 20 units (“
the proposed development
proposed building is approximately 33.3 metres in height and contains nine
levels of residential apartments.
Appellants have interests in adjoining vacant land parcels at 89-91 Golden Four
Drive, Bilinga (“
the adjacent land
”). The adjacent land has
the benefit of an approval for an 11-storey, 34.4-metre-tall residential tower
that has not yet been
constructed. The Appellants appealed against the
Council’s decision of 5 March 2024 to approve the proposed development
to conditions.
[3] One of the
Appellants key contentions in the appeal was that the proposed development did
not achieve a well-managed interface
with, relationship to and impact on nearby
development, including the reasonable amenity expectations of nearby residents.
of that contention, the Appellants relied on several assessment
benchmarks in Gold Coast City Plan 2016 (version 10) (“
”), including:
(a) the height uplift provision in s 3.3.2.1(9) of the Strategic framework;
(b) performance outcome PO1 (and the related acceptable outcome AO1) of the
Medium density residential zone code; and
(c) performance outcomes PO4, PO5 and PO13 (and related acceptable outcomes AO4,
AO5.2, AO5.3 and AO13) of the High rise accommodation
design code.
September 2025, Her Honour Judge Prskalo KC delivered reasons for judgment. Her
Honour’s reasons comprehensively address
each of the Appellants key
contentions, including those with respect to the interface between the proposed
development and the building
approved on the Appellants’ land.
Ultimately, Her Honour determined that Cielo Property Group Pty Ltd had
discharged its onus
and satisfied the Court that the appeal should be dismissed.
Her Honour concluded that, in due course, the development application
approved subject to conditions. To facilitate the preparation of a suite of
conditions, Her Honour ordered that the appeal
for review, where it would remain until a dispute arose about conditions of
Aesthete No. 15 Pty Ltd & Anor v Council of the City of the
Gold Coast &
Cielo Property Group Pty Ltd
[2025] QPEC 18.
[5] There is now
a dispute between the parties about one condition that the Appellants contend
should be imposed. That is the dispute
What are the proposed conditions
in dispute?
[6] On 1 October
2025, Cielo Property Group Pty Ltd notified the other parties that it did not
consider any aspect of the Court’s
findings required any change to the
conditions package originally attached to the Council’s decision notice of
5 March 2024
that approved the development application.
October 2025, the Appellants notified the other parties of the changes they
contended should be made to the conditions package
attached to the
Council’s decision notice. The proposed amendments were wholly contested
by the Council. Cielo Property Group
Pty Ltd took a more conciliatory approach
to some of the proposed amendments.
[8] Since that
time, the extent of the dispute about conditions has narrowed. As is identified
in the Appellants’ Submissions
on Conditions, the Appellants no longer
contend for a condition that would require developer’s structural and
geotechnical
measures to be subject to the peer review and consent of the owners
of 89-91 Golden Four Drive. The Appellants now accept that such
a requirement
is not reasonably required and is an unreasonable imposition upon the
development. That (belated) concession is appropriate.
[9] During the
course of the hearing of the conditions dispute, the parties requested several
short adjournments and, by the end of
the day, there was a further narrowing of
the conditions in dispute.
[10] The dispute
now only relates to whether there should be an additional condition requiring
screening to be applied to levels 1
to 8 inclusive of the rear façade of
the proposed development, which façade contains fenestration and
balconies that
face the adjoining land at 89-91 Golden Four Drive.
What is the relevant framework for
the decision?
is no dispute about the relevant framework for the decision.
Planning and Environment Court Act 2016
, subject to
and (5), the appeal proceeds by way of hearing anew. The Court
has a broad discretion in determining the appeal. It is to be exercised
judicially and subject to the limitations in the relevant statutes. The
statutory framework in the
Planning and
Environment Court Act 2016
Planning Act 2016
(Qld) provides
relevant guidance in that respect.
[13] The Court
must assess the development application under
as if it were the assessment manager:
Planning and Environment
Court Act 2016
The Court’s decision is governed by
Planning and Environment Court Act 2016
and informed by
Planning Act 2016
Sections 45(5)(a)(i)
Planning Act 2016
mandates assessment against the assessment
benchmarks in a categorising instrument that was in effect when the development
application
was properly made. Version 10 of City Plan is such a categorising
instrument:
Planning Act 2016
[15] Pursuant to
Planning Act 2016
ss 31(1)(f)
and (g) and
Planning Regulation 2017
(Qld), the assessment must also be
carried out having regard to, amongst other things and to the extent that they
are relevant:
(a) the development approval for, and the lawful use of, the premises or
adjacent premises; and
(b) the common material for the development application, including any properly
made submissions.
[16] There is a
power to impose development conditions on a development approval:
Planning Act 2016
. It is expressed in general
Australian Retirement Homes Limited v Pine Rivers Shire Council &
[2009] QPEC 92
[2010] QPELR 148
[17] In relation
to the proper approach to the construction of the power of a planning authority
to impose conditions, the Honourable
Justice of Appeal Doyle recently observed
Parklands Blue Metal Pty Ltd v Sunshine Coast Regional Council
“[23] The observations of Walsh J in
Commercial Constructions Pty Ltd v North Sydney Municipal Council
[1970] HCA 42
at 499 to 500 (applied unanimously in
Bathurst City Council v PWC
Properties Pty Ltd
[1998] HCA 59
(1998) 195 CLR 566)
offer a helpful starting point in
approaching the construction of the power of a planning authority to impose
conditions.
[24] His Honour observed that such power is to be understood:
“not as giving an unlimited discretion as to the conditions which may
be imposed, but as conferring a power to impose conditions
which are reasonably
capable of being regarded as related to the purpose for which the function of
the authority is being exercised,
as ascertained from a consideration of the
scheme and of the Act under which it is made. This purpose may be conveniently
in accordance with the expression used by Lord Jenkins in
Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council
, as being ‘the
implementation of planning policy’, provided that it is borne in mind that
it is from the Act and from
any relevant provisions of the Ordinance, and not
from some preconceived general notion of what constitutes planning, that the
of planning policy is to be ascertained.”
[25] It follows that a determination of the scope of a power (or limit on a
power) to impose a condition requires a review of the
relevant legislative
regime and consideration of the planning policy.”
[18] The power
(and obligation) to impose development conditions must be read subject to the
statutory provisions about lawful conditions.
Planning Act 2016
imposes a constraint on the power to impose conditions:
Australian Retirement Homes Limited v Pine Rivers Shire Council &
[2009] QPEC 92
[2010] QPELR 148
, 150 [8]. It, relevantly,
65 Permitted development conditions
(1) A development condition imposed on a development approval must–
(a) be relevant to, but not an unreasonable imposition on, the development or
the use of premises as a consequence of the development;
(b) be reasonably required in relation to the development or use of premises as
a consequence of the development.”
[19] Determining
whether conditions are reasonably required, for
, involves a
consideration of the proposed development and the changes that the development
is likely to produce:

condition that is not “
reasonably required
” in respect of a
proposed development may nevertheless be “

planning sense, such as where it is reasonably
imposed in the interests of
rational development of the area:

[1999] 2 Qd R 566
Lloyd v Robinson
[1962] HCA 36
(1962) 107 CLR 142
, 153. The mere fact
that a condition is relevant to the proposed development will not necessarily be
sufficient to justify its imposition:
Proctor v Brisbane City Council
(1993) 81 LGRA 398
[22] Even if a
condition is one that can be legitimately imposed having regard to the
constraints in
Planning Act 2016
, there is no obligation
to do so. The assessment manager, and this Court on appeal, retains a residual
discretion to otherwise determine
what lawful conditions should be imposed:
Hymix Industries Pty Ltd & Anor v Alberton Investments Pty Ltd & Anor
[2001] QCA 334
discretion is not to be exercised capriciously. Regard must be had to all
relevant considerations, including relevant provisions
of the planning

Allen Commercial Constructions Pty Ltd v North Sydney Municipal
[1970] HCA 42
[1970] 123 CLR 490
, 499-500. Improper considerations
must be disregarded. As was noted by His Honour Judge Rackemann in
Parkridge Pty Ltd v Logan City Council
[2014] QPEC 48
[2015] QPELR 49
[24] citing
Australian Retirement Homes Ltd v Pine Rivers Shire Council
[2009] QPEC 92
[2010] QPELR 148:
“... That discretion,
while broad, must be exercised for a proper planning purpose and not for any
ulterior purpose. A planning
purpose is one that implements a planning policy
whose scope is ascertained by reference to the legislation that confers planning
functions on the relevant authority. In the case of the SPA, the assessment
manager’s decision, including a decision to approve
subject to conditions,
must be based on the assessment of the application under Div 2 of
includes assessment by reference to the planning scheme.”
(footnotes omitted)
[24] The result
must not offend against common sense and the conditions must fairly and
reasonably relate to the permitted development
or the planning considerations
affecting the subject land:
Western Australian Planning Commission v Temwood
Holdings Pty Ltd
[2004] HCA 63
(2004) 221 CLR 30
, 86-8 [152]-[157]. The
condition must be fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the case.
Should the condition regarding
screening be imposed?
Appellants contend that a condition with respect to screening should be imposed
in the following terms:
“1. From Level 1 to Level 8,
inclusive, apply a treatment to the rear façade, as follows:
1.1 Where there is external glazing with no intervening balcony (such as on
part of the Level 01-03 rear bedroom windows): install
either fixed obscure
(translucent) glazing in any part of the window below 1.5m above floor level, or
above floor level that achieve 50% transparency;
1.2 Where a balcony is located: install either fixed obscure (translucent)
glazing to the balcony up to 1.5m above floor level, or
1.5m above floor level that achieve 50% transparency.”
Appellants contend that this condition is a lawful condition under
Planning Act 2016
on two bases.
[27] First,
the Appellants submit that the condition is:
“for a proper
planning purpose and in furtherance of the purposes of the Act of
creating ... efficient, safe and sustainable development safe and
sustainable development
applying ... safety
in the built environment in ways that are ...of public benefit
(s5(2)(i)).
[28] Second,
the Appellants’ contend that its proposed condition is reasonably required
to mitigate unacceptable adverse amenity
impacts that would be occasioned by the
interface with and impact on nearby development, including that associated with
overlooking
and privacy. They say that there is limited separation between the
proposed development and the approved development on the adjacent
land and, as
such, the proposed condition is a reasonable response to the change in the
existing state of things brought about by
the proposed development.
[29] The Council
and Cielo Property Group Pty Ltd oppose the imposition of the Appellants’
proposed additional condition about
screening. Both resist its imposition, in
the exercise of the Court’s discretion, on the basis that it is evident
findings of Her Honour Judge Prskalo KC that:
(a) the proposed condition is not required to adequately protect the privacy and
amenity of potential future residents of 89-91 Golden
Four Drive in accordance
with the adopted planning controls; and
(b) it is therefore an unnecessary imposition on the development.
How was the issue about interface, and the
need for screening, addressed at the merits hearing?
Appellants acknowledge that issues about interface with and impact on nearby
development, including that associated with
overlooking and privacy, were raised
by them, and the subject of evidence adduced by the parties, during the merits
hearing before
Her Honour Judge Prskalo KC.
[31] In that
respect, the Appellants say the issue arose in the context of assessment
benchmarks in City Plan that address the amenity
of nearby residents in the
context of the physical interrelationship between two high-rise towers,
including performance outcomes
PO4 and PO5 (and the associated acceptable
outcomes AO5.2 and AO5.3) of the High rise accommodation design code. The
also acknowledge that as part of the merits hearing, they alleged
non-compliance with performance outcome PO13 (and associated acceptable
AO13) of the High rise accommodation design code and the specific outcome in
s 3.3.2.1(9)(c) in the Strategic framework of
submissions are uncontested. They accord with my review of the exhibits and the
transcript, and I accept them.
respect to the evidence, the Appellants’ submit that the evidence adduced
at the merits hearing demonstrates that:
(a) the proposed development and the approved development on the adjacent land
both involve high rise towers;
(b) the approved development on the adjacent land includes a series of
residential dwellings in its northern corner, which include
bedrooms, outdoor
terraces and living spaces that are orientated directly toward the subject
(c) the proposed development provides a series of rear dwelling units that each
have two bedrooms (including the master bedroom)
and an outdoor terrace that
oriented directly toward the corresponding north-facing units approved on the
adjacent land; and
(d) once constructed, there will be 11.5 metres between habitable room
windows in the two buildings and nine metres between outdoor
terraces, with no
intervening privacy screening on the approved development on the adjacent land.
(e) Mr Nathan Powell, the visual amenity expert retained by Cielo Property
Group Pty Ltd, gave expert evidence and:
(i) accepted that the proposed rear facing windows will result in some degree of
overlooking of the neighbouring balconies and, as
such, do not comply with
acceptable outcome AO13(a) of the High rise accommodation design code;
(ii) opined that the proposed development would satisfy acceptable outcome
AO13(a) of the High rise accommodation design code if
a condition was imposed in
the terms now sought by the Appellants; and
(iii) opined that the recommended condition would further assist to limit
overlooking impacts and achieve a well-managed interface.
Appellants submissions about the evidence is uncontested. It accords with my
review of the evidence, and I accept them.
[35] In terms of
submissions on this issue at the merits hearing, the Appellant says:
(a) in its written submissions, Cielo Property Group Pty Ltd said:
“At worst, the alleged privacy impacts are a matter for conditions. Mr
Powell marked up the result of such conditions in Figure
NP2 on p24 of the
Visual amenity joint report, Exhibit 9.”
(b) in oral submissions, Cielo Property Group Pty Ltd said:
“Firstly, we say a screening’s not required to meet the planning
scheme provisions that are in issue. The position of
Mr Curtis and Mr Powell on
that point could not have been clearer in the joint report. It’s not
required, and that’s
why it hasn’t been proposed, but if your Honour
were to take a different view, contrary to what is submitted commencing at
paragraph 78, it’s still open to your Honour to impose that condition. It
doesn’t – it's not a matter that the
appellant – pardon me,
the co-respondent is seeking, but it doesn’t diminish from your
Honour’s discretion.
In terms of any suggestion that this is a surprise or that your Honour
wouldn’t be minded to do it, your Honour has the benefit
of the visual
amenity joint report where - and as was put to Mr Carter during
cross-examination, it was effectively agreed by all
three experts that screening
would be possible and that it could be done adequately, and your Honour sees
that in the visual amenity
joint report, exhibit 9, page 13, at paragraph 40,
where it was said, “The experts agree that to the extent the court finds
necessary,” so consistent with what I’ve just submitted
[36] There is no
dispute about these matters. They accord with my review of the written and oral
submissions, and I accept them.
[37] Even though
the Appellants acknowledge that the acceptability of the interface impacts of
the proposed development were traversed
in the merits hearing, they contend that
it is appropriate for me to exercise my discretion to impose their proposed
condition about
screening because Her Honour Judge Prskalo KC did not
conclusively deal with the matter. According to the Appellants, Her Honour
not decide whether the extent of non-compliance with the High rise accommodation
design code justified the condition recommended
by Mr Powell. Rather, the
Appellants say that Her Honour only concluded that the proposed development
complied with the higher order
provision requiring a well-managed interface
found in the specific outcome in s 3.3.2.1(9)(c) of City Plan.
acknowledge that the primary headings in Her Honour Judge Prskalo KC’s
judgment refer to various criteria in s 3.3.2.1(9)
of City Plan. This is
understandable given Her Honour’s observation at paragraph [80]
“The appellants also concede that if compliance is found
with the uplift provision, having considered that provision in the
the corresponding group of lower order benchmarks, it is unnecessary for the
court to give these other provisions their
own separate consideration because
non-compliance will not in that event separately warrant refusal. Conversely,
the appellants submit
that if the court finds noncompliance with the uplift
provision, it will inevitably find non-compliance with most of the other
benchmarks;
together this will constitute serious non-compliance with the
planning scheme justifying refusal.”
[39] That said,
consideration of Her Honour’s reasons in
Aesthete No. 15 Pty Ltd &
Anor v Council of the City of Gold Coast & Cielo Property Group Pty Ltd
[2025] QPEC 18
– [178], being those paragraphs under the heading
Specific outcome 3.3.2.1(9)(c) – a well-managed
(a) Her Honour was well aware of the issues raised by the Appellants (and sought
to be raised again now) and the evidence adduced
by the Appellants with respect
to those issues, but did not find the Appellants’ evidence to be
compelling: see paragraphs
[139], [140], [143], [145], [156] – [162],
[165], [170], [171], [174], [176] – [178];
(b) Her Honour was aware of each of the assessment benchmarks raised by the
Appellants in support of its proposed condition: footnote
52 and paragraphs
[145], [147], [151] – [155], [158] – [165], and [170];
(c) Her Honour was satisfied that the rear setbacks to the adjacent land
complied with acceptable outcome AO1 of the Medium density
residential zone
code, except for a 0.5 metre projection by the level 8 balcony: paragraphs
[145] and [146];
(d) Her Honour was greatly assisted by (and clearly accepted) the evidence of
Mr Richards about design elements that contribute to
a well-managed
interface: paragraphs [148] and [149];
(e) Her Honour was greatly assisted by (and clearly accepted) the evidence of
Mr Powell and Dr McGowan about the issues of overlooking,
overbearing,
overshadowing, and outlooks or views, including their opinions about the extent
of compliance with acceptable outcome
AO1 of the Medium density residential zone
code and acceptable outcomes AO13 of the High rise accommodation design code:
[150] – [156];
(f) Her Honour found the proposed development complied with performance outcome
PO4 (and the associated acceptable outcomes) of the
High rise accommodation
design code: paragraphs [165], [166] and [170];
(g) Her Honour found the proposed development did not comply with acceptable
outcome AO5.3 but complied with acceptable outcome AO5.3
and performance outcome
PO5 of the High rise accommodation design code: paragraphs [162] and [164];
(h) overall, Her Honour was satisfied that the proposed development complies
with s 3.3.2.1(9)(c): paragraph [178].
[40] Her Honour
also dealt further with the Appellants’ concerns about the interface
between the proposed development and the
approved development on the adjacent
land in [303] – [312], being those paragraphs under the heading
Adverse internal amenity impacts for future occupants
Relevantly, Her Honour observed:
“[303] The appellants argue a
final standalone reason for refusal as being internal amenity outcomes, because:
(a) the design of the rear apartments concentrates living rooms westward,
directly facing the Golden Four Drive development and obliquely
towards the
airport, thereby ignoring valuable ocean views, breeze, and sunlight to the east
while also creating overlooking and
development;
[304] The appellants further argue that the bedrooms and living spaces of the
proposed development will not enjoy adequate natural
light access, particularly
during the winter months.
[305] The relevant benchmarks appear in the Appellants’ Amended
Benchmark Groupings at paragraph 9. This issue is assessed against
benchmarks.
[306] As to the building interrelationship issues, the appellants rely upon
the submissions related to the “well managed interface”
criteria. This issue was the subject of considerable evidence and has been
considered in the analysis of compliance with uplift
criterion (9)(c).
[308] As is evident from the findings in respect of the uplift criteria, in
my view the rear apartments of the proposed development
do not result in
unacceptable privacy and overlooking impacts. I consider that the internal
amenity of the rear apartments is appropriate
given the zoning of the land and
the development intensity sought by the planning instruments.”
[41] There is no
suggestion anywhere in Her Honour’s reasons that her many findings of
compliance were contingent on the imposition
of a condition requiring screening.
Rather, Her Honour’s findings clearly relate to the proposed development
without such a
condition or design change: see, for example, paragraphs [69]
– [73], [132], [140], [143], [148], [149], [151] – [155],
– [205], and [207].
[42] It is clear
from paragraphs [150] to [157] of Her Honour’s reasons that Her Honour
accepted the primary views of Mr Powell
and Dr McGowan that the
prospect of unreasonable overlooking was already mitigated without the
additional screening. Mr Carter’s
competing opinions that further
screening was required were found not to be persuasive. Those opinions relied
on the NSW Apartment
Design Code, a document not called up by City Plan:
paragraphs [156] and [157].
[43] When one
carefully considers the entire reasons for judgment, it is apparent that Her
Honour Judge Prskalo KC considered Mr Powell’s
evidence about the
possible imposition of a condition about glazing or screening. However, she did
not express a view that such
a condition was necessary. It is apparent that
this is because Her Honour was satisfied that the proposed development was
in the absence of such a change to its design. That is, although the
recommended condition was acknowledged, Her Honour considered
it unnecessary to
require its imposition. The condition was clearly not material to Her
Honour’s conclusion that the design
of the proposed development was
sufficient to satisfactorily mitigate unacceptable adverse amenity impacts that
would be occasioned
by the interface with, and impact on, nearby development,
including that associated with overlooking and privacy.
[44] For the
reasons given above, I disagree with the Appellants’ assertions that Her
Honour Judge Prskalo KC did not conclusively
deal with the interface issue and
the non-compliances with City Plan alleged by the Appellants.
Conclusions regarding imposition
of the condition regarding screening
[45] As I noted
at paragraph
above, the Appellants
advance two bases on which they contend that their proposed condition about
screening is a lawful condition
Planning Act 2016
I identify them in paragraphs
respect to the first basis, the Appellants’ submission misquotes the
effect of the
Planning Act 2016
. Ignoring that, I accept that when
considering whether the proposed condition should be imposed, it is relevant to
have regard to
Planning Act 2016
[47] That said,
I do not accept the Appellants’ contention that consideration of
Planning Act 2016
alone demonstrates that the
Appellants’ proposed condition about screening is a condition for a proper
planning purpose and,
as such, lawful under
Planning Act
. That submission is at odds with the recent observations of the
Honourable Justice of Appeal Doyle in
Parklands Blue Metal Pty Ltd v Sunshine
Coast Regional Council
[2025] QCA 207 at [25] where His Honour said that a
determination of the scope of a power to impose a condition requires a review
the relevant legislative regime
consideration of the planning policy.
Each limb of
Planning Act 2016
also requires the
condition to be considered in the context of the proposed development.
[48] As to the
Appellants’ second contention, having regard to the relevant assessment
benchmarks put in issue, Her Honour Judge
Prskalo KC’s reasons, and my
review of the exhibits and the transcripts, I am satisfied that the proposed
condition is not
required to mitigate unacceptable adverse amenity impacts that
would be occasioned by the interface with, and impact on, nearby development,
including impacts associated with overlooking and privacy. It is not required
to adequately protect the privacy and amenity of potential
future residents of
89-91 Golden Four Drive in accordance with the adopted planning controls.
satisfied that compliance with the relevant planning controls with respect to
interface, privacy and overlooking are achieved
without the proposed condition.
Those planning controls inform the planning purpose of a condition such as that
sought by the Appellants.
Given there is already compliance with the planning
controls (i.e., there is compliance without the imposition of the condition),
the condition is an unnecessary and unreasonable imposition on the proposed
development.
[50] In those
circumstances, in my view, the Appellants’ proposed condition about
screening is not a lawful condition under
Planning Act
[51] Further,
and in any event, I am not prepared to exercise my discretion to impose the
Appellants’ proposed condition about
screening. Based on my own review of
the evidence (including the assessment benchmarks), submissions and transcript,
it seems to
me that it represents an unnecessary burden on the proposed
development.
[52] For the
reasons provided, I do not accept that the conditions contained in the
Council’s decision notice dated 5 March
2024 require amendment.
[53] I propose
(a) the appeal is dismissed; and
(b) the decision of the Council of the City of Gold Coast made on 5 March 2024
in respect of the development application for a development
permit for a
material change of use for multiple dwellings (20 units) in respect of land
situated at 90-92 Pacific Parade, Bilinga,
properly described as Lots 1 and 2 on
RP87297, and notified in the decision notice dated 5 March 2024, is confirmed.
