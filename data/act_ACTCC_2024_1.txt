Introduction

Pre-Sentence Report
comprehensive and most helpful 15 page pre-sentence report dated 24 August 2023
and an 18 page update filed 30 November 2023 were
prepared for this sentence. I
thank the authors for their diligence. The initial report sets out
Pedro’s performance and
engagement whilst on remand at the Bimberi Youth
Justice Centre (BYJC) at page 3:
Pedro was described as]
‘absolutely fabulous, nothing but a pleasure’
the same page the following was said about Pedro and his performance at
Murrumbidgee School whilst in custody:
‘[Pedro] is slowly settling into education at Murrumbidgee School.
This term he has actively engaged in Year 10...He is working
well on English and
math units of work. [Pedro] enjoys art, particularly focusing on indigenous art
and working with Gugan Gulwan
on their weekly visits to our
positive reports should be balanced with an attempt to climb a fence and a
threat to assault staff early in his remand. Privileges
were lost as a result
of those behaviours.
there was an earlier release on bail on March 30 2023 to attend the Ted Noffs
PALM residential rehabilitation program which
was not successful and resulted in
Pedro being remanded back into custody in April after a warrant was issued by
accepted these mixed reports as some evidence of potential for rehabilitation
for Pedro. It appears that he can settle down and
thrive when he has
appropriate support around him but that should be viewed through a prism of his
limited demonstrated success where
Pedro is not heavily
supervised.

The 23 April 2022 offending
this charge the young person and a co-offender held an Uber driver at knife
point and took his vehicle. Some hours later a police
vehicle gave chase and
then terminated that chase when the car went over the border into NSW. The car
was the subject of a loss
of driver control and it then travelled down an
embankment.
was caused to the car and the uber driver suffered psychological harm and
financial loss. He provided a victim impact statement
to the Court that set out
the significant harm caused to him.
co-offender was aged 16 at the time. He was sentenced to a conviction and good
behaviour order.
objective seriousness of offending falls in the mid-range or just below it.
conceded that this offending called for a sentence of imprisonment
notwithstanding the sentence imposed on the co-offender.
should be noted that this offence occurred prior to the sentence imposed on
Pedro in November 2022 and in that sense Pedro had
not yet been fully appraised
by the court of the seriousness of this type of offending. In those
circumstances I thought that a short
sentence of imprisonment was
appropriate.
The 27 November 2022 offending
offending involved Pedro and two co-accused young persons turning on another
young person who had attempted to befriend them
with gifts in return for company
and friendship. The offending was brutal and almost wholly captured on
telephone footage.
co-offender held a knife to the victim’s back and a demand for $4000 was
made. The co-offender then held the knife to the
victim’s throat and said
“That’s ok, we’re just going to fuck you up a bit and take
your shit”.
followed was the victim surrendering a chain from his neck, a beating resulting
in the victim falling to the ground and subjected
to multiple punches, kicks and
stomps to the head. Further footage shows the victim being forced to kiss the
shoe of a co-offender.
victim was cornered and outnumbered by the offenders. He had no chance of
defending himself. The offending was violent, harmful
and belittling.
Photographs
show the grazing and swelling suffered as a result. It is fortunate that
greater injuries were not caused given the application
of force to the
victim’s face and head region.
victim impact statement tells of the ongoing suffering and embarrassment caused
by the offending.
should be noted that Pedro did call out for the offending to stop by using the
words “leave him, leave him”. In that
sense it was clear that by
then Pedro no longer agreed with the offending behaviour. Some difference in
sentence should be considered
in those circumstances.
objective seriousness of offending falls above the mid-range.
was serious personal violence performed by a group against a defenceless young
person. It involved a gross breach of trust.
It called for a sentence of
imprisonment and no party submitted otherwise.
co-offender has been sentenced to a sentence of six month’s imprisonment.
I thought that given Pedro had no physical involvement
in the actual violence
that six months was an appropriate start point for him.
25 June 2023 offending
charges relate to Pedro being the driver of a previously stolen motor vehicle
and using the same victim’s credit card
to pay for fuel.
have already sentenced Pedro for the accompanying offence of driving whilst
unlicensed.
offending was relatively benign as Pedro is not alleged to have been the
original thief of the car or card. It falls towards
the lower end of the range
of objective seriousness.
parties submitted that a sentence of imprisonment was not the only sentencing
option and I ultimately agreed.
The 05 July 2023 offending
offending involved Pedro and another young person going on to the premises of a
gym at Gungahlin. Pedro took a handbag containing
car keys and used the keys to
take the owner’s car.
leisure centre some 300 metres away was then the subject of a further entry and
again the taking of a handbag containing car keys.
offending itself was not serious, but the inconvenience caused to the second
victim was significant. Her victim impact statement
was read out in Court. It
eloquently sets out just how difficult this offending made her life and how much
distress she and her
children were caused.
prosecution conceded that the offending did not call for a sentence of
imprisonment and the defence submitted that it was a ‘line-ball’
objective seriousness of offending falls at the lower end.
was an accompanying fail to appear charge from 01 May 2023. It was conceded
that a sentence of imprisonment was not necessary
and that a lesser sentence was
within range.
The 06 July 2023 offending
was a series of offending on commercial premises during the early hours of the
following morning. Footage was tendered of some
of the offending.
offences involved using force by way of heavy objects or feet to gain access to
these premises and steal items from within.
premises were the Village Café at Waramanga (1014), the Grind Café
at Kambah (1015), the A Bite Eat Café
at Chifley (1498), the Canberra
Café at Tuggeranong (1350) and Urban Fresh Sushi at Tuggeranong
1014/2023 represents the only unsuccessful attempt at gaining entry.
other four aggravated burglaries are also the subject of scheduled offences
pursuant to
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
schedules allow accompanying offences of theft and property damage to be taken
into account on the principal aggravated burglary
sentences. This is a
convenient ‘global’ manner in which to sentence that avoids
‘loading up’ young people’s
criminal histories with multiple
offences. Pedro has consented to this process.
objective seriousness of offending falls below the mid-range for offending on
commercial premises.
is properly conceded that each offence in this series calls for a sentence of
imprisonment. I agree – no other lesser sentence
would be appropriate
– however, totality should have a significant part to play in the overall
outcome for these five offences
given that they occurred within quick succession
of each other.
The 15 September 2023 offending
are charges that were the subject of guilty pleas on the day of hearing. A more
serious charge was contested and dismissed.
It will not be taken into account
in any way on sentence.
slightly older adult and Pedro set out to take a persons’ car by
pretending to be interested in buying the car. No intention
to steal was
adult offender told the car owner that she was feeling unwell and requested that
he buy her a drink. She was in the driver’s
position and Pedro was seated
behind the owner who was in the front passenger seat.
scuffle over keys ensued and Pedro assaulted the owner of the car from behind by
hitting him once in the head and twice to the shoulder
area. He suffered
abrasions and bleeding with photos being tendered to prove these injuries.
Pedro was apprehended outside of the car by members of the public.
was intoxicated. He was arrested and gave a false name. Later, after a demand
was made for his clothing, he struck out with
his feet and kicked an officer in
the shoulder.
defence do not concede that a sentence of imprisonment was called for on any of
the charges. I agree except for the Assault.
It was actual violence on an
innocent victim in the course of pursuing the dishonest taking a of a car.
Injuries were occasioned.
Nothing short of a sentence of imprisonment is called
for on that charge.
The decision of
and Sentencing Aboriginal
has endured an extremely traumatic upbringing which undoubtedly engages the
principles discussed by the High Court in
[2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571
confirmed that when sentencing Aboriginal offenders "full weight" should be
given to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing
decision. I am
compelled to give full weight to Pedro’s ‘subjective features’
that I set out at the beginning
of this decision.
Bugmy Bar Book
sets out in
detail some of the experiences relevant to many Aboriginal
alcohol spectrum disorders;
to domestic and family violence;
Incarceration
of a parent or care-giver;
Interrupted
school attendance and suspension;
of home care
sexual abuse;
exposure to alcohol and other drug abuse,
generations and descendants;
brain injury;
impairment;
Unemployment;
dispossession;
socio-economic status; and
of imprisonment or remands in custody.
is clear that Pedro has been exposed to many of those experiences, or his
personal history is relevant to them.
prosecution submitted that the
principles do operate in this
matter. What that means is that the Court should moderate the young
person’s moral culpability
for his offending and limit the weight to be
given to general deterrence. This needs to be balanced with the fact that
general deterrence
still has a moderated role to play given the seriousness of
the offending conduct.
The decision of
and Impaired Mental Functioning
is a Victorian case that helpfully set out sentencing principles for criminal
offenders suffering from impaired mental functioning:
Impaired mental functioning, whether temporary or permanent ("the
condition"), is relevant to sentencing in at least the following
1. The condition may reduce the moral culpability of the offending conduct,
as distinct from the offender’s legal responsibility.
Where that is so,
the condition affects the punishment that is just in all the circumstances; and
denunciation is less likely to
be a relevant sentencing objective.
condition may have a bearing on the kind of sentence that is imposed and the
conditions in which it should be served.
3. Whether general deterrence
should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration depends upon the
nature and severity
of the symptoms exhibited by the offender, and the effect of
the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the
time of the
offending or at the date of sentence or both.
4. Whether specific
deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration
likewise depends upon the nature and
severity of the symptoms of the condition
as exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental
capacity of
the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of
the sentence or both.
The existence of the condition at the date of sentencing (or its foreseeable
recurrence) may mean that a given sentence will weigh
more heavily on the
offender than it would on a person in normal health.
6. Where there is a
serious risk of imprisonment having a significant adverse effect on the
offender’s mental health, this will
be a factor tending to mitigate
punishment.
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
Complex Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) and Reactive Attachment Disorder”.
Ultimately,
I find that there is no evidence of or obvious causal connection between
Pedro’s mental health and his offending
– however it is a relevant
consideration for sentence per
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
(ACT). It is reasonable for the Court to proceed on the basis that because of
his mental health issues and youth Pedro is not a
suitable person to make an
example of for the purpose of general deterrence. In combination with the
operation of the
principles this means that general deterrence has
a limited role to play in this sentence.
Offending whilst on conditional Liberty
respect to all but the first series of offences, Pedro was on conditional
liberty at the time of the commission of the offences.
That is, he was subject
to bail conditions and expected to not re-offend.
on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offences is a
serious aggravating feature at sentence, but care
is required to avoid double
punishment:
Kelly v Ashby
[2015] ACTSC 346
saddens the Court to repeat
fact that there was no culture specific bail support service for Aboriginal
children and young people charged with criminal offences
in the ACT when Pedro
re-offended whilst on bail. Such a service might have improved his chances of
not reoffending and of appearing
in Court. I gave that fact significant weight
when considering the seriousness or aggravating nature of offending whilst on
Sentences of the Court
sentence can be backdated to 20 March 2023 because Pedro has been in custody for
a total 311 days up until midnight
charge 1411/2022 the Aggravated Robbery, it is conceded by the Court that a
sentencing error was made on 25 January 2024. Due
to an error on the Court file
this offending was originally sentenced as an attempt. This was erroneous. The
parties brought this
to the Court’s attention, the proceedings were
and the error was
corrected on 06 February 2024. I convicted Pedro and started at a sentence of
two months. I reduced that by about
25% to one month and 15 day’s
imprisonment. It will commence on 20 March 2023 and finish on 04 May 2023. That
time is served.
charge 299/2022 the Joint Commission Aggravated Robbery I convicted Pedro and
started at a sentence of six months imprisonment.
I reduced that by about 25%
to four and a half months imprisonment (four months and 15 days). It will be
cumulative as to four
months so as not to offend the totality principle. It
will commence on 20 April 2023 and finish on 4 September 2023. That time
charges 956 and 957/2023 the Ride/Drive Without Consent and Obtain Property by
Deception imprisonment is not called for. I convicted
Pedro on both and imposed
identical Good Behaviour orders for 10 months to ensure that Pedro has the
benefit of supervision until
he is almost 18.
charges 949 and 950/2023 the Take Motor Vehicle Without Consent Charges it was
conceded that imprisonment was not necessary. I
convicted Pedro on both and
imposed identical Good Behaviour orders for 10 months for the same reasons as
charge 951/2023 the Aggravated Burglary with Intent to Steal I convicted Pedro
and started at 2 months imprisonment and reduced
that to one and half
month’s imprisonment (one month and 15 days). It will be cumulative as to
one month and concurrent as
to 15 days on the previous sentence. It will
commence on 20 August 2023 and finish on 4 October 2023. That time is
charge 953/2023 the Fail to Appear, I impose a conviction and no further
Joint Commission Aggravated Burglary, Aggravated Burglary (and one attempt)
charges all resulted in a conviction and sentence
of imprisonment. It was
agreed that nothing less would suffice. Convictions are recorded on
On 1014/2023 the attempted burglary on the Village Café I started at two
months imprisonment and reduced that to one and a
half months (one month and 15
days) on account of the plea. It will be concurrent as to 15 days and
cumulative as to one month on
the previous charge. It will commence on 21
September 2023 and finish on 4 November 2023. That time is
each of the other Burglaries I convicted Pedro and started at the same point
– three months imprisonment reduced to two and
a quarter months (two
months and seven days) each. On 1015/2023 the Aggravated Burglary on the Grind
Café the sentence of
two months and seven days will be cumulative as to
one month on the previous charge and concurrent as to one month and 7 days. I
have taken the uncharged Theft and Damage Property offences into account as per
the schedule signed by me today. The sentence will
commence on 28 September 2023
and finish on 04 December 2023. That time is served.
1498/2023 the Aggravated Burglary on a Bite to Eat Café I impose the same
sentence - a reduced sentence from three months
to two months and seven days
will be cumulative as to one month on the previous charge and concurrent as to
one month and 7 days.
I have taken the uncharged Theft and Damage Property
offences into account as per the schedule signed by me today. The sentence
commence on 29 October 2023 and finish on 4 January 2024. That time is served.
1350/2023 The Joint Commission Aggravated Burglary on the Canberra Cafe even
though the offence was aggravated by joint commission,
I impose the same
sentence - a reduced sentence from three months to two months and seven days
will be cumulative as to one month
on the previous charge and concurrent as to
one month and 7 days. I have taken the uncharged Theft and Damage Property
into account as per the schedule signed by me today. The sentence will
commence on 29 November 2023 and finish on 04 February 2024.
1349/2023 The Joint Commission Aggravated Burglary on Urban Fresh Sushi even
though the offence was aggravated by joint commission,
I impose the same
sentence - a sentence reduced from three months to two months and seven days
will be cumulative as to one month
on the previous charge and concurrent as to
one month and 7 days. I have taken the uncharged Damage Property offence into
as per the schedule signed by me today. The sentence will commence on 27
December 2023 and finish on 4 March 2024.
the final series it is only the charge of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm
that calls for a sentence of imprisonment. I
note the submissions of the
parties but I am of the view that it was a serious assault given the
circumstances in which it was committed.
Any other sentence would not
adequately represent the criminality and all of the circumstances of the
offending. On that charge
1291/2023 a conviction is recorded. I started at two
months imprisonment and reduced it to a month and a half (one month and 15 days)
it will be cumulative as to one month and concurrent as to 15 days on the
previous offence. The sentence will commence on 21 February
2024 and finish on
4 April 2024.
charge 1289/2023 the Provide False Name a conviction is recorded with no further
charge 1292/2023 a conviction is recorded and a 10 month good behaviour order is
imposed in the same terms and for the same reasons
as the other similar
is a total sentence of one year and 16 days running from 20 March 2023 to 4
April 2024. I have considered whether to suspend
the remaining 71 days of
Pedro’s sentence.
On one view of it, it is in his best interests to not have a suspended sentence
hanging over him and it is better for him to use
that time to marshal resources
and support and prepare himself for an organised departure from custody.
However, I am sure that
he is anxious for release and keen to prove his good
that basis and the hope that he will, indeed, be of good behaviour, I will
suspend the balance of Pedro’s sentence from today,
24 January 2024, and
require him to enter a suspended sentence order for 10 months in the same terms
as the other good behaviour
