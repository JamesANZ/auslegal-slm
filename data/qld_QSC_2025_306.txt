Junjie Ou v Xuefei Wang
[2025] QSC 52
ME Clarke for the plaintiff
The defendant appeared on her own behalf
SOLICITORS:
Auslaw Future for the plaintiff
The defendant appeared on her own
[1] On 12 March
2025, I dismissed the application by the plaintiff, Mr Ou to amend his statement
of claim. The reasons are published
[2025] QSC 52.
Those reasons explain the
parties, the background and the application to amend. This is a fresh
application to amend.
[2] It is worth
noting that the earlier application to amend was an application brought at a
relatively late stage and in circumstances
where the previous pleading had been
settled by junior counsel. The explanation for the proposed amendment was that a
newly retained
senior counsel had recommended the amendments.
[3] The new
draft of the statement of claim is now proposed on a similar basis – that
is, these amendments are proposed by new
counsel. However, one problem for the
defendant, Ms Wang, is that her previous pleadings had been prepared when she
was legally represented.
It will be difficult for Ms Wang to respond to an
amended pleading. She says she cannot afford further legal
representation.
Ms Wang’s Objections
Wang says that the only explanation given for the proposed amendment is that Mr
Ou has hired a new lawyer. She raises a number
of other objections, including
(a) the amendments are inconsistent with the facts;
(b) there is no evidence of the assumption that is pleaded by the plaintiff as
existing between the parties;
(c) the amendments will cause her significant prejudice and are unfair;
(d) Mr Ou has simply rephrased the amendments proposed previously, and this is
akin to ‘old wine in new bottles’;
(e) Mr Ou has, by amending, caused delay and
disruption to the litigation; and
(f) the proposed amendment will restart the
litigation process, waste judicial resources and is inconsistent with
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
objection on the basis that the amendments are inconsistent with the facts
[objection (a) above] can be disregarded. The accuracy
of the plea is generally
a matter for the trial. The position is similar for Ms Wang’s claim that
there is no evidence of the
assumption [objection (b) above]. Mr Ou will
presumably give evidence of the assumption. And on this issue much will depend
proper translation and interpretation of the WeChat messages.
[6] However, the
other objections have a degree of force to them. It is necessary to look at the
content of the proposed amendments.
The Proposed Amendments
[7] Earlier
this year Mr Ou sought to add a new paragraph 11A. That paragraph is quoted in
the reasons of March 2025.
amendment was refused because of its imprecision and the open-ended nature of
the particulars.
[8] Mr Ou now
proposes to amend to add new paragraphs 12A and 12B. Those paragraphs, which
include a number of WeChat messages translated
from Mandarin, are as
12A. On 16 March 2023:
Linklaw circulated a Deed of Gift to the plaintiff and Ms Wang by a
message sent at 2:50pm;
There followed an exchange of texts between the plaintiff and Ms Wang in
the following terms:
What does a gift agreement mean?
(text from plaintiff at
There is no in and out account in Australia. If go through the
contract of sale, the possibility of the property price being checked
relatively high
(text from Ms Wang at 3.15pm);
Now put $115 as gift so pay less stamp duty
(text from Ms
Wang at 3.16pm);
Don’t worry, you won’t be unpaid. The lawyer knows there
is a transaction in RMB. If I don’t give you, you can trace
(text from Ms Wang at 3.17pm);
That is, you will give me all the money in RMB?
the plaintiff at 3.18pm);
Not all of all. 1 - 1.5 million in RMB. Let me see how many there
are. The card has expired. I have to come back to activate it. I
will give you
the rest in Australian dollars once the loan is obtained
Ms Wang at 3.20pm);
Or you can ask for RMB/USD
(text from Ms Wang at
This gift means I give you my property as a gift?
from plaintiff at 3.26pm);
Uh, yes...literally
(text from Ms Wang at 3.27pm);
Aren’t you willing to?
(text from Ms Wang at
I don’t get a penny and I sign a gift agreement?
(text from the plaintiff at 3.27pm);
You didn’t tell me it was a gift deal before
from the plaintiff at 3.28pm);
I paid for your lawyer even I don’t get anything
(text from Ms Wang at 3.31pm);
You are afraid I won’t pay you?
(text from Ms Wang
at 3.33pm);
You could’ve at least told me about this way in advance
(text from the plaintiff at 3.33pm);
You have done everything and now you are telling me it is a gift
(text from the plaintiff at 3.33pm)
That’s right. I am worried of course
the plaintiff at 3.34pm);
You stay here and refuse to leave. How can I not be afraid?
(text from the plaintiff at 3.34pm);
Then what should do? (sic) I told you to transfer it over first. You
said ok. That means there is no limit to the way of doing it
from Ms Wang at 3.42pm);
Let me think about it
(text from the plaintiff at
I’ll definitely give it to you. Otherwise, you tell the lawyer
that I don’t give you money at that time and the whole
Brisbane knows that
I extorted money from my cousin...(sic)
(text from Ms Wang at
By the statements made by Ms Wang to the plaintiff as set out in
paragraphs (b)(iv) and (xxi) above, in the context of the exchange
paragraphs (b)(i) to (xix) above, Ms Wang assured the plaintiff that, if he
executed the Deed of Gift and transferred
the Property by way of gift, he would
be paid the amount of the Purchase price (
the Assurances).

On or about 16 March 2023, and in
reliance on the Assurances, the plaintiff executed a Deed of Gift purporting to
transfer the Property
as a gift to Spon.
[9] The chain of
WeChat messages is therefore said to give rise to ‘the Assurances’.
Mr Ou alleges that the effect of the Assurances is
that he was persuaded to execute the Deed of Gift which Mr Ou says
‘purported’
to gift the property to Ms Wang’s company, Spon.
The Assurances are later pleaded as representations that provide the basis
an estoppel claim by Mr Ou. In essence, Mr Ou wishes to go behind the Deed of
Gift on the basis that he was persuaded to sign
that deed because of the
Assurances.
The Legal Context
are two legal problems running through the pleadings. The
Mr Ou sues on a contract for the transfer of land that is not in writing. And
so, Mr Ou has the problem of the statute of
frauds. The rule is that no action
may be brought on any contract for the sale or other disposition of land, or any
interest in land,
unless the contract or some memorandum or note of it, is in
writing and signed by the party to be charged or their
To be a sufficient
memorandum of the contract, the writing is required to describe the parties to
the contract, the land the subject
of the agreement, the price, and all
essential terms.
required to be signed.
[11] Despite the
statute of frauds problem, Mr Ou claims an agreement that he would sell the
property at St Lucia to Ms Wang for $1.5
million. The agreement is said to be
contained in an exchange of WeChat messages between Mr Ou and Ms Wang which are
in Mandarin.
There are numerous problems with regarding the WeChat messages as a
sufficient memorandum recording the essential
let alone the requirement of
a signature or some authentication. The statute of frauds problem is made more
complicated because in
her defence Ms Wang asserts a further oral agreement
regarding the land and involving her
The payments she
subsequently made to Mr Ou are said to be a part of that agreement rather than
the agreement alleged by Mr Ou. Suffice
it to say that Ms Wang’s
allegation of an oral agreement also appears to suffer the statute of frauds
document which supplies the essential details of the transaction is the deed of
gift. That deed raises the
legal problem. The deed of gift
records, in clear terms, that the transaction was a gift from Mr Ou to Spon. A
party who executes
a deed is estopped from denying the truth of the facts stated
in the deed.
Whilst Ms Wang’s
defence does not expressly rely on such an estoppel, her reliance on the
specific terms of the deed of gift
are clear from sub-paragraphs 13(b) and (c)
of her defence.
The Other Proposed Amendments
Ou proposes to add paragraphs 16A and 24A. They are relatively minor and do not
expand the case.
[14] Mr Ou also
proposes to redraft the estoppel claim. These are largely a redraft of the
existing claim but with the addition of
a claim of conventional estoppel to the
existing equitable promissory estoppel claim. The case is not expanded by this
alteration.
[15] That is the
context in which Mr Ou now makes a further application to amend his statement of
Applying the Principles
principles concerning amendment were discussed in the reasons of March
The relevant factors are as
as with the last application, the proposed amendment comes very late. The
pleadings have closed, disclosure has been completed,
the evidence-in-chief has
been filed and served. Although it has been necessary to try to resolve some
issues with the translations,
substantively all that remains is for trial dates
to be allocated. That has been the case since March 2025.
[18] Second
as on the last occasion, the only explanation for this late proposed amendment
is that Mr Ou’s new counsel have advised of
the desirability of the
proposed amendments. In fact, as explained, this is the second attempt at that
re-draft of the pleading.
these proposed amendments do not expand the case in a significant way. On any
view, the WeChat messages between the parties are
central to the dispute and
have always been central to the dispute.
[20] Fourth
whilst it may take some effort for Ms Wang to alter her defence, the prejudice
and inconvenience to her is not likely to be significant.
The substantive issues
are already properly engaged. Indeed, Ms Wang’s reliance on the expression
‘old wine in new bottles’
rather illustrates that there is no
substantive difference in Mr Ou’s case.
[21] Fifth,
whilst Ms Wang is right that Mr Ou’s proposed amendments have caused
delay and disruption to the litigation, it is important
that both parties have
the opportunity to run their case as they see fit.
[22] In the
circumstances, whilst the factors are relatively evenly balanced, the discretion
ought to be exercised to permit Mr Ou
to make the amendments proposed and to
allow Ms Wang a fair opportunity to respond.
proposed amendments will be allowed. I will hear the parties on the orders
necessary for a trail and on the costs of the
application.
