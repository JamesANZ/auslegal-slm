Acknowledgments
We would like to thank various agencies –
including Court Services Victoria, WorkSafe Victoria and Fines Victoria –
so generously providing the data examined in this statistical report.
The Sentencing Advisory
Council is an independent statutory body established by the
Sentencing Act
(Vic). Our mission is to bridge the gap between the community, the
courts and the government by informing, educating and advising
on sentencing.
Our functions include:
statistical information
on sentencing;
on sentencing and sharing it with interested persons;
public opinion
on sentencing matters; and
advising the
Attorney-General
on sentencing matters.
A note on terminology
For simplicity, in this
report, we use the term
to broadly refer to all
non-natural persons, including companies registered under the
Corporations
(Cth), incorporated and unincorporated associations, public
entities and charitable organisations.
In this report, a

Executive summary
This statistical report
is being released alongside a detailed consultation paper in which we are
seeking stakeholder and community
views about a variety of questions related to
the sentencing of occupational health and safety (OHS) offences. This report is
to perform two functions: first, to be a standalone report that can
provide a useful overview of the sentencing of OHS offences in
the 16 years to
30 June 2021 (the reference period); and second, to provide a transparent
evidence base to which stakeholders and
the community can refer in making
written submissions to, or consulting with, us as we consider the various
opportunities for reform.
The focus of this report
This report examines all offences sentenced under the
Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004
(Vic) since its commencement in
July 2005, as well as under the
Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2017
Our inquiry is not limited to any particular court jurisdiction, so for the
reference period we examine all 1,086 cases involving
OHS offences sentenced in
the Magistrates’ Court, 110 cases involving OHS offences sentenced in the
County Court, and the 1
case involving OHS offences sentenced in the Supreme
DPP v Hazelwood Power Corporation Pty Ltd
[2020] VSC 278).
in the report, we do briefly include offences contrary to the
Occupational
Health and Safety Act 1985
(Vic), which was replaced by the
, but only to give a true overview of the prevalence of sentenced OHS
offences; after that, offences under the
OHS Act 1985
are excluded.
Key findings
There were 1,903 OHS offences sentenced in 1,197
cases during the reference period. Most offenders were companies (83.3%), and
individual offenders were male. There were only 6 females sentenced for OHS
offences during the reference period (0.5%), one of whom
was also the only
person to receive a prison sentence for an OHS offence (for recklessly
endangering serious injury in a workplace
(section 32)).
Given their respective populations, most justice regions in Victoria were
proportionately represented in the number of OHS offences
and cases sentenced.
There was, though, a significant over-representation of OHS cases in the Barwon
South West region (especially
in Geelong), where there were 13% of OHS cases
despite only 6% of Victoria’s businesses being in that region, and a
corresponding
under-representation in metropolitan Melbourne (67.1% of cases).
Most OHS cases sentenced in the higher courts involved a death (80% or 62 of
78 cases with available sentencing remarks) and most
of the remaining OHS cases
in the higher courts involved someone being injured (12% or 10 cases). There
were very few OHS cases in
the higher courts that involved a risk only (8% or 6
cases). In the Magistrates’ Court, the level of harm could be ascertained
in 697 cases: 27 involved a death (4%), 483 involved an injury (69%) and 187
involved a ‘risk-only’ offence where no
one was injured or killed
Employer breach of duty offences (sections 21 and
By far the most common OHS offences sentenced in
Victoria are employer breaches of duty to reasonably provide a working
environment
that is safe and without risks to the health of their employees
(section 21) or members of the public (section 23). The maximum penalty
employer breach of duty offences is 9,000 penalty units for companies and 1,800
penalty units for individuals, which in 2023–24
are about $1.73 million
and $346,000, respectively.
Together, these offences accounted for 66% (1,255 charges) of the 1,903 OHS
offences sentenced during the reference period. Of those
1,255 charges, most
were sentenced in the Magistrates’ Court (1,107 charges or 88%), with the
remainder sentenced in the higher
courts (12%). Most employer breach of duty
offences were committed by companies (1,035 charges or 83%), with the remainder
by individuals (17%).
The vast majority of offenders pleaded guilty (98% in the Magistrates’
Court and 79% in the higher courts), while the remainder
were found guilty after
contesting the charges.
The most common sentencing outcome, by far, was a fine, at 99% of the 148
charges in the higher courts, and 91% of the 1,107 charges
Magistrates’ Court. Almost all of the remaining offences resulted in
either an adjourned undertaking or a diversion
In the Magistrates’ Court, the median fine imposed on companies for
employer breach of duty offences dropped significantly (in
dollar values)
between the first and second halves of the reference period (the 8 years to 30
June 2013 and the 8 years to 30 June
2021), from $40,000 to $20,000. At the same
time, penalty unit values in Victoria increased from about $105 in 2005–06
$165 in 2020–21. When expressed as a number of penalty units (and
not as dollar amounts), there seemed to have been a real
decline of about 70% in
the median fine imposed for this offence in the decade to 30 June 2021. As of
2019–20, the median fine
imposed on a company in the Magistrates’
Court for an employer breach of duty offence was 125 penalty units, representing
5% of the jurisdictional limit (2,500 penalty units) and 1% of the maximum
fine (9,000 penalty units).
Other breach of duty offences
Other breach of duty offences were the next most
common type of OHS offence sentenced during the reference period. These relate
health and safety duties owed by self-employed persons (section 24),
employees (section 25), managers and controllers of workplaces
(section 26),
designers of plant (section 27), designers of buildings or structures (section
28), manufacturers (section 29) or suppliers
(section 30) of plant or
substances, and people who install, erect or commission plant (section 31). Also
included here is the duty
of employers to monitor and provide information about
health and safety to employees (section 22). The maximum penalty for most of
these offences is 1,800 penalty units for an individual, and 9,000 penalty units
for a company (with offences under sections 22 and
28 being exceptions).
There were 224 other breach of duty offences sentenced in 172 cases during
the reference period. The majority of these were sentenced
Magistrates’ Court (210 charges in 159 cases). Managers/controllers breach
of duty offences under section 26 (129 charges)
and employee breach of duty
offences under section 25 (50 charges) were the most common. A relatively high
proportion of offenders
were individuals (42%); some of these offences do not
apply to companies, for example, the duty owed by employees.
A fine was imposed on 179 of the 210 charges sentenced in the
Magistrates’ Court and 12 of the 14 charges sentenced in the higher
courts. Adjourned undertakings were relatively more prevalent for offences of
employees failing to take reasonable care for health
and safety, with 23% of
these offences receiving an adjourned undertaking in the Magistrates’
Court. This most likely reflects
the higher proportion of individuals prosecuted
for these offences.
Fines for these offences in the Magistrates’ Court ranged from $1,000
to $250,000, with companies receiving a median fine of
$20,000, and individuals
a median of $4,000. In the higher courts, fines for these offences ranged from
$5,000 to $450,000, with
a median fine of $100,000. The 5 largest fines were all
imposed on companies for managers/controllers breach of duty offences under
section 26.
Breach of notice offences
Breach of notice offences relate to failures to
comply with a notice issued by WorkSafe, including an improvement notice
111), a non-disturbance notice (section 110), a prohibition notice
(section 112) or a provisional improvement notice (section 62).
undertaking offences concern breaches of an enforceable undertaking that has
been entered into by an individual or a company
with the consent of WorkSafe
(section 16). There were no breach of undertaking offences in the reference
There were 134 breach of notice offences sentenced in 71 cases during the
reference period, with 131 charges in 69 cases sentenced
Magistrates’ Court. Breaches of improvement notices were most common,
making up 105 of the 134 charges. The majority
of offenders sentenced for breach
of notice offences were companies (85%).
The maximum penalty for the 4 breach of notice offences (and the breach of
undertaking offence) is 500 penalty units for an individual
and 2,500 penalty
units for a company.
Other OHS offences
Other OHS offences involve a board range of
non-breach of duty/notice offences (including offences against the
Regulations
) sentenced during the reference period. These other OHS offences
include failing to notify WorkSafe of an incident (section 38);
preserve an incident site (section 39); conducting work without a licence or
registration (section 40); conducting work
without prescribed qualifications,
experience or supervision (section 41); interfering with or failing to comply
with the exercise
of an inspector’s functions (sections 100, 119, 120,
121); failing to provide information to WorkSafe (section 9); providing
misleading information (section 153); discriminating against an employee
(section 76); and recklessly endangering serious
injury in a workplace (section
There were 290 other OHS and regulation offences in 147 cases during the
reference period. Most of these were sentenced in the Magistrates
charges in 144 cases). The majority of offenders sentenced for other OHS
offences were companies (66%).
Failing to notify WorkSafe of an incident was the most common offence
sentenced during the reference period, with 116 charges in 70
Of the offences against the
OHS Regulations
, the most common involved
licence assessors failing to conduct assessments in accordance with
WorkSafe’s requirements. There
were 21 charges in 2 cases sentenced for
this offence during the reference period.
Payment of fines for OHS offences
There were 392 cases sentenced between 1 January 2017
and 30 June 2021 for which data on fine payment could be obtained, involving
total of $24 million. Of these cases, 261 (67%) had fines that were fully paid
as of July 2023, representing $13.1 million (or
54% of the total value of fines
imposed). Fines were fully paid for 61% of the value of fines imposed in the
Magistrates’ Court
and 44% of the value of fines imposed in the County
Court. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the yearly fine payment
rates: fines imposed in OHS cases in 2017 were fully paid at a similar rate
(75%) as fines imposed in OHS cases in 2021 (74%).
A number of factors were correlated with higher rates of fine payment.
Offenders sentenced without a conviction were more likely than
those sentenced
with a conviction to have fully paid their fine (77% compared to 55%). Companies
were more likely than individuals
to have fully paid their fine (70% compared to
42%). And companies that were still operating were far more likely than
deregistered
companies to have fully paid their fine (79% compared to 6%).
Introduction
1.1 This report
presents a statistical overview of the sentencing of occupational health and
safety (OHS) offences in Victoria in
the 16 years from 1 July 2005 to 30 June
2021 (the reference period). The overview includes all offences in the
Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004

this report are twofold: (1) to present the first detailed analysis of
sentencing for OHS offences in Victoria since
the introduction of the

alongside this report, calling for submissions on the sentencing
of OHS offences
and providing information that may assist anyone wanting to make a
submission.
The regulation of occupational health and safety in
people responsible for workplaces have obligations to ensure that work is done
without risks to the health and safety of those
tasked to do the work as well as
to the general public. In Victoria, these obligations arise from the

overarching objectives of the OHS regulatory environment in Victoria, including
the principles of health and safety
protection, and it tasks enterprises,
and others with certain obligations. The
OHS Regulations
prescribe ways to fulfil those obligations in certain contexts, such as when
manual handling or when dealing with hazardous chemicals.
Objectives of the OHS Act
objectives of the
are to protect workers and the public from
risks to health, safety and welfare arising from the enterprises of employers

only that all reasonable steps are taken to prevent injury.
The Act does not require employers to ensure that accidents never happen. It
requires them to take such steps as are practicable
to provide and maintain a
safe working environment. The courts will best assist the attainment of this end
by looking at the facts
of each case as practicable people would look at them:
not with the benefit of hindsight, nor with the wisdom of Solomon, but
nevertheless

is the safety of those who work for them.

Section 4 of the
Enforcement of OHS laws
OHS laws are enforced by WorkSafe.
Where WorkSafe becomes aware that there is a breach of the law, it has a number
of enforcement options outside prosecution to attempt
to rectify the breach. It
can issue a notice – such as a non-disturbance
an improvement
or a prohibition notice
– against the individual or
If a notice has not been
complied with, WorkSafe can apply to the Supreme Court for a mandatory or
restrictive injunction to compel
compliance with the notice, or to prevent a
breach of the notice.
WorkSafe can
also institute criminal proceedings for non-compliance or breaches of

compliance with OHS laws can vary in terms of the complexity of those laws and
the degree to which compliance is certain.
It may be assumed that, most of the
time, companies and individuals fulfill their duties and obligations by ensuring

they do – and the work that they engage others to do –
is done in accordance with accepted standards. Equally, not every

detected, and not every detected offence results in prosecution or
sentencing.

in the Magistrates’ Court. If the matter
is to be committed to the County
Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions takes carriage of the

consultation with WorkSafe.

industry classification, and it provides information specific to a case,
such as whether the offender pleaded guilty or whether the
court recorded a
conviction. We used the data to inform sentencing outcomes in the
Magistrates’ Court, as a counterpart to
the sentencing remarks available
for sentencing outcomes in the County Court and Supreme Court. With the data, we

provide context to the data on sentenced OHS offences, this chapter begins with
an overview of the annual number of workplace inspections
in Victoria, the
annual number of WorkCover claims, and the annual number of OHS prosecutions
commenced by WorkSafe. The number of
workplace inspections and WorkCover claims
is important contextual information because the number of prosecuted and
sentenced OHS
offences represents only the
workplace safety incidents, workplace inspections and workplaces in Victoria.
This is consistent with WorkSafe’s ‘constructive
which involves
promoting safety through a wide combination of regulatory tools designed to both
encourage good practices and deter
unacceptable performance. An OHS prosecution
is just one of those tools, and typically a tool of last resort.
Number of workplaces, inspections and claims
from WorkSafe’s annual reports suggests that there are hundreds of
thousands of workplaces in Victoria. As of 2021–22,
WorkSafe covered
347,978 workplaces.
annual number of workplace inspections (and non-physical enquiries) remained
quite stable over the last 13 years, ranging from
around 41,000 to around 49,000
(Figure 1).

2.5 In that same
timeframe, the annual number of new WorkCover claims also stayed relatively
stable, ranging from around 27,000 to
around 29,000 (Figure 2). Given that
Victoria’s population increased significantly in that time, from roughly
5.5 million to
6.6 million, the relatively stable number of claims actually
represents a per capita decrease in the number of Victorians making
claims (from 0.52% of Victorians to 0.43%).

Given the effects of COVID-19 on court

any trend from the data in more recent years; however, in the years prior to
COVID-19, there
was a considerable increase in the number of OHS prosecutions

number of OHS cases fluctuated in both the Magistrates’ Court and the
higher courts. However, an overall uptrend
can be observed in the
Magistrates’ Court, especially in the decade to 2018–19, prior to

of OHS cases in the higher courts appeared to

manslaughter during the reference period.
2.16 Almost all
of the charges in OHS cases were OHS offences. In the higher courts, none of the
111 OHS cases involved non-OHS offences.
2.17 In the
Magistrates’ Court, there were 49 non-OHS offences in 21 OHS cases. Most
of those 49 charges were workplace-related,

in Victoria: metropolitan Melbourne, Barwon South

Hume and Loddon Mallee. Figure 9 shows how many OHS cases and charges were
sentenced in each of those
justice regions during the reference period.
Two-thirds of OHS cases (67.1%) were sentenced in metropolitan Melbourne, while
other one-third (32.9%) were sentenced in regional Victoria. The Barwon
South West region was over-represented, with just 6% of Victoria’s
but 13% of sentenced
OHS cases and 14% of charges. This could be because WorkSafe’s offices are
located in Geelong, making
the courts in Barwon South West a more likely choice
for OHS prosecutions.

How were OHS offences sentenced?
2.25 Maximum
penalties for OHS offences range from 5 penalty units to 9,000 penalty units,
and some offences carry maximum prison
terms. Given this, there are significant
limitations in examining the sentence types imposed for all OHS offences
together. Fines
were the predominant sentencing outcome for OHS offences. Of the
1,903 OHS offences sentenced during the reference period, 86.7%
received a fine
(1,650 charges), another 11.4% received an adjourned undertaking (217 charges),
and the remaining 1.9% received a
diversion plan (27 charges), a community order
(4 charges), an immediate or a suspended prison sentence (4 charges), and a
without conviction (1 charge).
Industries of OHS offenders
Australian Bureau of Statistics and Statistics New Zealand have developed a
standardised industry classification system
Using that system, we
were able to determine the industries in which OHS offences occurred (so long as
we had sentencing remarks
or a prosecution result summary). OHS offenders from
the construction and manufacturing industries were by far the most common in
both the Magistrates’ Court and the higher

almost 80% of those (62 cases), there was
a death, in another 12% someone was injured (10 cases), and in 8% of cases no
one was injured
or killed (risk only) (6 cases). Of the 62 cases where someone
died, the victims were employees or contractors in 54 cases, members

employer breach of duty offences

focuses on offences that involve an employer failing to take reasonable care in
preventing risks to health and safety
under sections 21 and 23 of the
. This includes two employer breach of duty offences:
provide and maintain a safe working environment for employees and contractors;
exposing members
of the public to risks to health and safety.
3.2 There also
exists an employer’s duty to monitor the health of employees and workplace
conditions, and provide information
to employees concerning health and safety at
the workplace, contained in section 22 of the

duty offence is addressed in Chapter 4, as its maximum penalty is substantially
lower than that for the two employer

not, though, necessarily mean that the courts considered the OHS offending in
all of those cases to have caused the

where the court raised questions as to whether the death or injury was caused by
the employer’s
breach of duty. For example:
DPP v Ricegrowers
, the basis for the finding of guilt for the section 21
offence was that the company had failed to locate an emergency stop button
within reach of a contractor. The court concluded that it was not
‘satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the breach of duty
in this case
did in fact cause or contribute to the [contractor’s]

The remaining 14 offenders were convicted at trial, including 13
companies and 1 individual. And of 669 offenders in the Magistrates’

offences (97.9% of charges). The remainder were found

How many charges received fines?
examining the lengths of sentences or fine amounts imposed for an offence, only
charges that were not part of an aggregate
sentence (non-aggregate sentencing
outcomes) are useful. This is because when offences collectively receive an
aggregate sentence,
it is impossible to delineate the contribution that each
offence made to the total sentence.
power to impose aggregate fines for OHS offences (or any offences) is located in
Sentencing Act
(Vic). When imposing fines for multiple
offences in the same case, the
Sentencing Act
enables courts to impose
either a separate fine for each offence or a single aggregate fine without
specifying the fine amount for
each charge. Aggregate fines can only be imposed
if the offences ‘are founded on the same facts’ or are ‘of the
same or a similar
character’.
3.27 As shown in
Table 3, 43% of fines in the Magistrates’ Court and 16% of fines in the
higher courts were part of an aggregate

individuals, there is no clear trend given the few non-aggregate fines imposed
(48 in total, with an average of 3 per year).
The sudden increase in
2020–21 is in part due to the imposition of the jurisdictional limit of
$77,730 for 1 of 4 non-aggregate
fines that year.
differently, Table 4 shows the median fine for companies and individuals in the
first and second halves of the reference
period (the 7 years to 30 June 2013 and
the 8 years to 30 June 2021).
The median fine for companies precisely halved between those two timeframes,
from $40,000 to $20,000. The drop in the average fine
is less drastic, but that
is due to a handful of outliers. In comparison, the median and average fines for
individuals increased

course, the value of a dollar changed in line with inflation during the
reference period. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia,

(the value of a penalty unit in the first year of the reference period) would
actually be valued at $150.85 in 2021

increase in the value of a penalty unit. In turn, the maximum fine for an
employer breach of duty offence
increased from $943,290 to $1,486,980 for a
company, and the jurisdictional limit in the Magistrates’ Court (2,500
units for companies) increased from $262,025 to $413,050.
way of removing the confounding effect of inflation on fines over time is to
express each fine amount as the number of penalty
units that each fine
represents.
We calculated this
number using the applicable penalty unit at the date of offence (as opposed to
the date of sentencing),
appears to be the prevailing approach to assessing applicable penalty units.
Figure 14, we present the fines imposed on companies as the number of penalty
units that each fine represents. (Note that while
the number of penalty units is
calculated using the value of a penalty unit at the date of offence, the penalty
units are presented
according to the year of sentencing.) Figure 14 uses a
box-and-whiskers-plot (box plot) to represent the annual distribution of penalty
units for each financial year of the reference period. The box plots show key
points of the distribution of penalty units, including
the median (represented
by the line within each box).

even more clearly shows that, in recent years, there has been a significant
reduction in the values of fines imposed
on companies for employer breach of
duty offences. The median fine was highest in 2011–12, at 419 penalty
units, and has declined
since then, to 125 penalty units in 2019–20. In
real terms, then, fines for employer breach of duty offences decreased by about
70% in the decade to 30 June 2021.

Trends in fine amounts in the higher courts
contrast, the median fine imposed in the higher courts for employer breach of
duty offences seems to have increased. While the
number of charges each year is
relatively low (there were 110 charges overall that received non-aggregate
fines), the median fine
for companies almost doubled from the first half of the
reference period (from $135,000 in the 6 years to 30 June
to the second half of the
reference period (to $250,000 in the 8 years to 30 June 2021). There was a
similar increase in the median
fine for individuals, from $65,000 in the first
half to $100,000 in the second half (Table 5).

Fine amounts for employer breach of duty offences across
justice regions
the reference period, fines for charges of employer breach of duty offences were
fairly evenly imposed across the justice regions
in Victoria. The median fine
imposed on companies in the Magistrates’ Court in metropolitan Melbourne
(where 321 charges received
non-aggregate fines) was the same as the median fine
imposed on companies in the Magistrates’ Court in the other justice
(where 204 charges received non-aggregate fines): $25,000 (Table 6). The
average fine was larger than the median fine across all
justice regions, which
shows that very high outlying fines were imposed in all

Were fine amounts higher in cases involving death?
both the Magistrates’ Court and the higher courts, cases involving death
received more severe sentencing outcomes than
cases involving injury or no
injury. This section examines the distribution of fines imposed on companies in
the Magistrates’
Court and higher courts with regard to the level of harm
described in the case. As a caveat, this analysis does not account for the
minority of cases where the court made a finding that the offending did not
the particular harm; instead, it accounts for whether there was
such harm in the case. Notwithstanding, the data shows a substantial

Magistrates’ Court
and 13 in the higher courts. Of those 172 cases, a
significant number involved individual offenders (72 or 41.9%). This is
substantially
higher than the proportion of individuals involved in
OHS cases (16.7%), reflecting that some of these other breach of duty
offences are not applicable to companies (e.g. self-employed

Number of cases involving death or injury
the 13 cases involving other breach of duty offences sentenced in the higher
courts, 6 involved a death and 1 involved serious
injury. The cases involving
death included:
quarry company that did not adequately consider the consequences of dump trucks
driving on the top of a scoria stockpile (section
small construction company that failed to ensure a bobcat was safe to operate
(section 26);
abattoir company that failed to ensure an unloading ramp was designed to suit
its purpose, properly maintained and used safely
4.7 Of the 159
cases involving other breach of duty offences sentenced in the
Magistrates’ Court, the level of harm involved
in the case was able to be
determined in 98 cases. Of these, 55 cases involved injury, 3 involved a death,
and 40 did not involve
an injury or a death.
Guilty pleas
the higher courts, of the 13 cases involving other breach of duty offences, we
were able to determine the offender’s
plea in 8 cases. The offender
pleaded guilty in 6 of those cases (75.0%).
Magistrates’ Court, plea data was available for 95 of the 159 cases
involving other breach of duty offences. The
offender pleaded guilty in 92 of
those 95 cases (96.8%). The other 3 cases involved companies that were found
guilty after contesting
the charges.
Sentencing outcomes in the higher courts
maximum penalty for all but 2 of these other breach of duty offences was 1,800
penalty units for an individual and 9,000
penalty units for a company. The 2
offences with different maximum penalties were:
failing to monitor or provide information about health and safety (240 penalty
units for individuals and 1,800 for companies);
designers of
buildings or structures breach of duties (500 penalty units for individuals and
2,500 for companies).
4.11 A fine was
imposed for almost all the 14 other breach of duty offences sentenced in the
higher courts (12 or 85.7%). Of the other
2 charges, 1 received an adjourned
undertaking and 1 received a community correction order. Of those 12 charges
receiving fines,
11 were non-aggregate fines (i.e. they were not part of an
aggregate sentence). These non-aggregate fines ranged from $5,000 to $450,000,
with a median of $100,000. The 5 largest fines were all imposed on companies for
managers/controllers breach of duty offences; fines
ranged from $230,000 to

4.13 Figure 21
shows the sentencing outcomes by specific offence. Fines were slightly less
prevalent for employee breach of duty offences
(70.8%). Only individuals can be
prosecuted for this offence, so this is probably a key factor in the relatively
high use of adjourned
undertakings (22.9% or 11 charges) as an alternative
sentence to a fine.

appeals in OHS cases
7.1 This chapter
examines sentence appeals in OHS cases. These include 31
appeals from the Magistrates’ Court to the County Court, as well as 19
sentence appeals from the County Court to the
Court of Appeal.
Key findings:
There were 31
sentence appeals in OHS cases from the Magistrates’ Court to the County
Court: 7 initiated by offenders and 24
initiated by the Director of Public
Prosecutions
Offenders were
successful in 4 of 7 appeals, while the Director was successful in 21 of 24
The largest
increase in a fine following a successful appeal by the Director was from
$225,000 to $425,000
There were 19
sentence appeals in OHS cases from the County Court to the Court of Appeal: 9
appeals were based on manifest inadequacy
of sentence and 6 were based on
manifest excess of sentence
Of the appeals
based on manifest inadequacy, 5 of 9 were successful, and the largest increase
in a fine following a successful appeal
was from $100,000 to $750,000
Of the appeals
based on manifest excess, 2 of 6 were successful, and the largest decrease in a
fine following a successful appeal
was from $380,000 to $190,000
Sentence appeals from the Magistrates’ Court to the
County Court
sentenced in the Magistrates’ Court have a right to appeal a finding of
or the sentence that
was imposed.
The Director of
Public Prosecutions can also appeal the sentence imposed where satisfied that it
is in the public interest to do
Appeals from the
Magistrates’ Court are heard in the County Court
appeals, that is, the appeal must be conducted as a rehearing. The County Court
is required to set aside the sentence and impose
any new sentence that was
available in the Magistrates’
7.3 According to
data provided by WorkSafe Victoria, there were 7
appeals against
sentence by OHS offenders during the reference period (Figure 25). All offenders
were companies. The original sentences
in those cases were fines that ranged
from $15,000 to $80,000. The County Court imposed the same sentence that the
Magistrates’
Court had imposed in 3 of those cases and imposed a lower
sentence in the other 4, with reductions in penalties of 50%, 53%, 33%
7.4 There were
sentence appeals by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
All offenders in those cases were also companies. The original sentences
those cases were fines that ranged from $1,000 to $225,000, with a median of

of these 24 appeals are illustrated in Figure 26. In 2 of those cases, the
County Court imposed the same sentence
that the Magistrates’ Court had

County Court actually

majority (21 cases) of
appeals by the Director of Public
Prosecutions, however, the County Court significantly increased the original
sentence. The 3 greatest
proportional
increases in penalties were 650% in
2 cases (from $1,000 to $7,500, and from $2,000 to $15,000) and 614% in 1 case
(from $7,000 to
$50,000). And the three greatest
increases in
penalties were $200,000 (from $225,000 to $425,000), $135,000 (from $40,000 to
$175,000) and $100,000 (from $50,000 to
$150,000). The average proportional
increase in penalties among the 24 cases (including the case where the sentence
was reduced)
was 206%, effectively tripling the original sentence, and the
average numerical increase was $30,000.
Sentence appeals from the County Court to the Court of
appeals from the Magistrates’ Court, sentence appeals from
the County or Supreme Court to the Court of Appeal can only succeed
if there is
an error in the original sentence. The error can be either specific or
non-specific – the latter means that the
original sentence was so high or
low that it was not reasonably open to the sentencing judge to
7.8 From June
2005 to May 2023, there were 19 published Court of Appeal judgments that
involved a sentence appeal by either the prosecution
or the offender in an OHS
case. Of those 19 cases:
10 were sentence
appeals by the prosecution – 9 were on the basis that the original
sentence was manifestly inadequate (too
low), and 1 was on the basis that the
compensation orders imposed were inadequate; and
9 were sentence
appeals by the offender – 6 were on the basis that the fine imposed was
manifestly excessive (too high), while
1 related to an error of law (causation),
1 related to a compensation order (alleging it was excessive), and 1 related to
allegations of error in the original sentence.
7.9 Of the 19
judgments, 5 involved offences contrary to the
OHS Act 1985
offences under the
OHS Act 1985

especially given how few appeal cases there were.
Sentence appeals by the prosecution in OHS cases
9 sentence appeals, the Director of Public Prosecutions contended that the
sentence was manifestly
inadequate;
appeals were dismissed (involving 5
offenders).
In the other 5
cases (involving 6 offenders), the Court of Appeal found that the sentence
imposed was manifestly inadequate and resentenced
but imposed the
same sentence on 1 offender.
The changes made to sentence following successful sentence appeals by the
Director of Public Prosecutions are shown in Figure 27.

8.1 This chapter
discusses payment of fines for OHS offences. The management, collection and
enforcement of fines for OHS offences
are undertaken by the courts, Fines
Victoria and WorkSafe, with Fines Victoria most commonly responsible for the
monitoring, collection
and enforcement of fines. As Fines Victoria’s
current systems were established in 2017, we requested fine payment data for
cases sentenced from 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2021 (4.5 years); Fines Victoria
provided fine payment data to July 2023.
Key findings:
Offenders in 392
OHS cases received a fine between 1 January 2017 and 30 June 2021
354 companies
and 38 individuals were fined
imposed in 360 cases in the Magistrates’ Court and 32 cases in the County
Fines in the 392
cases totalled $24 million ($14.6 million in the Magistrates’ Court and
$9.5 million in the County Court)
Two-thirds (67%)
of fines were fully paid as of July 2023, representing $13.1 million (54% of the
total value of fines)
unpaid or only partly paid in 131 cases (fines were partly paid in 18 cases (4%)
and were completely unpaid in the remaining
113 cases (29%))
The rate of full
payment was higher for companies than for individuals, while deregistered
companies were significantly less likely
to have fully paid fines
Cases included in the analysis
8.2 Offenders
in 392 OHS cases received a fine between 1 January 2017 and 30 June 2021 (360
cases in the Magistrates’ Court,
and 32 cases in the County Court). These
392 cases are the focus of this chapter.
8.3 Offenders in
those 392 cases were fined $24,046,305 in total, at an average of over $61,000
per case. Fines imposed in the Magistrates’
Court totalled $14.6 million
(an average of $40,000 per case), while fines imposed in the County Court
totalled $9.5 million (an
average of $296,000 per case). We received fine
payment data for all but 2 cases: 2 individuals in unrelated cases were fined a
of $13,000 in the Magistrates’ Court. It was assumed that these 2
individuals had not paid their fines.
How many fines were fully or partly paid?
in 261 (66.6%) of the 392 cases had fully paid fines as of July
These fully paid fines
amounted to 61.1% of the total value of fines imposed in the Magistrates’
Court, or approximately $8.9
million, and 43.9% of the total value of fines
imposed in the County Court, or $4.2 million (Figure 29). Together, the 261
paid fines represent just over half (54.3%) of the total dollar value of
fines imposed ($13,056,080 of $24,046,305). There were also
a number of fines
that were partly paid,
not many (14 cases in the Magistrates’ Court and 4 in the County Court, or
18 in total). And there were 113 fines that
were completely unpaid (98
Magistrates’ Court fines, and 15 County Court fines). It is important to
note that there may be
a number of reasons why fines are not fully paid shortly
after sentence, including offenders entering into payment
arrangements.
summarise, of the $24,046,305 of fines imposed in 392 OHS cases during the
4.5-year period, $10,304,001 imposed in 131 cases
remain unpaid (42.9% of the
total value of fines).

imposed in OHS cases in 2017 were fully paid at a similar rate (74.7%) as fines
imposed in OHS cases in 2021 (73.5%), even
though some fines imposed in 2021
were paid within a 2.5-year period. This suggests that a minimum 2-year
follow-up period sufficiently
accounts for potential delays in fine payments.
8.7 Table 12
shows the rate of fully paid fines for individuals and companies sentenced in
both the Magistrates’ Court and the
higher courts (the rates of fully paid
fines were higher for companies than for individuals). It also shows the average
fine imposed
on individuals and companies (companies received higher fines than
individuals did) and the average value of fully paid fines for
individuals and
companies (the values of fully paid fines are roughly comparable to the values
of original fines imposed).

Factors relating to fine payment
section explores the relationship between factors, or ‘predictors’
(see Appendix 3), identified in OHS cases
and the likelihood of offenders paying
fines imposed in OHS cases. Table 13 shows the rate of fully paid fines based on
these factors
(3 cases did not have available sentencing remarks or prosecution
result summaries and so were excluded).

8.9 The factors
that show the greatest differences in rates of fully paid fines were as follows:
Deregistration
6.5% of fines for deregistered companies were fully paid, compared to 79.1% of
fines for companies that were still active;
: 42.1% of fines for individuals were fully paid, compared to 69.5% of
fines for companies. However, Figure 30 shows that one-quarter
of fines for
individuals were partly paid, which could reflect payment arrangements under an
agreement with Fines Victoria;
55.0% of fines were fully paid where offenders had a conviction recorded,
compared to 76.5% of fines where offenders had no conviction
80.7% of fines for offenders in the manufacturing industry were fully paid,
compared to 56.2% for offenders in the construction
industry, and 66.2% for
offenders in all other industries; and
: 72.0% of fines for cases involving an injury or death were fully
paid, compared to 51.2% of fines for cases involving a risk

strengths of the relationships between these factors and fine payment are
determined by their correlation
coefficients.
There were 294
cases considered for this analysis (95 cases were excluded due to missing values
in any of the factors of
). The correlation
coefficients of the 10 factors are shown in Table 14. A positive value indicates
correlation with
non-payment
, and conversely, a negative value indicates
correlation with payment.

examined the extent to which each factor predicts fine non-payment by
calculating the odds ratio.
In this context, an odds ratio is the odds of non-payment among fines
a factor (e.g. conviction) divided by the odds of non-payment among
a factor (e.g. no conviction). Four of the factors had a
statistically significant effect on the likelihood of non-payment (Figure

offenders who had a conviction recorded were less likely to have fully paid
fines (see [8.9]), having a conviction recorded
was not a significant predictor
of non-payment. Similarly, the type of OHS offence in the case was also not a
significant predictor.
8.14 There is
some caution required in considering these findings:
individuals are more strongly associated with not having a
fine, it is important to bear in mind that, as shown in Figure 30, individuals
were significantly more likely than companies
to have partly paid fines. This
suggests that individuals had entered into a payment arrangement and continued
to pay their fines
after 30 June 2023.
Fines imposed in
the County Court increased the likelihood of non-payment by an odds ratio of 3.
As these fines were imposed for offending
that was more likely to involve
injuries and death, this contrasts with the overall finding that cases involving
harm are likely
to have fines fully repaid. There seems to be an unidentified
factor relating to non-payment among offenders sentenced in the higher

Appendix 2: Methodology
Connecting WorkSafe data to Magistrates’ Court sentencing
obtained prosecution result summary data for all incidents from 2012 to 2023.
These incidents were numbered by WorkSafe independently.
The majority of
WorkSafe data did not include references to Magistrates’ Court data to
enable exact linkage between the datasets.
The main limitations in matching the data were:
the company name
was not available in the sentencing data in the relevant period;
case IDs were
not available in WorkSafe data prior to 2021;
amounts for cases are not recorded in the sentencing data;
WorkSafe data
incidents can refer to multiple charges in one case sentenced in the
Magistrates’ Court;
WorkSafe data
incidents can refer to a sample of charges in one case sentenced in the
Magistrates’ Court, with the remaining
charges recorded under another
cases of related
offenders sentenced separately but on the same date may have the same WorkSafe
incident number; and
fine amounts
were missing from WorkSafe data in some cases or did not match the prosecution
result summaries.
We matched WorkSafe data to sentencing outcomes on
the basis of a best possible match.
If the sentencing date matched the prosecution date, the court locations were
the same, and both date and location appeared only once
in the WorkSafe and
Magistrates’ Court datasets, it was deemed a ‘perfect’ match
for the WorkSafe prosecution.
If the sentencing date matched the prosecution date and the court locations
were not the same, the sentence in the Magistrates’
Court was interrogated
to identify the error in the court location. If resolved, the case was deemed a
match for the WorkSafe prosecution.
Otherwise, using a subset of data on sentencing outcomes in the
Magistrates’ Court (798 cases where offences against the
received fines), we matched WorkSafe prosecutions to the:
match: if the sentencing outcomes that share a
date and court location
and the date and court combination exists
data, then this WorkSafe case is likely represented in the
sentencing data by the case at that date; or
best match: if the sentencing outcomes share a
and the date exists
in the sentencing data, then this WorkSafe case is
probably represented in the sentencing data, but the court location is wrong in
one of the sources.
Otherwise, when there were multiple cases
finalised on identical dates and no single WorkSafe incident was connected
according to
the steps above, we manually checked the incidents and cases
occurring on same dates to identify the correct matches between the
Identifying co-offenders
To identify co-offenders, we relied on data from
sentencing remarks, WorkSafe prosecutions, and sentencing data. If only one
for a case was identified in narrative data from sentencing remarks or
prosecution result summaries, we assumed only one offender
was involved in a
Conversely, if narrative data was not available, we assumed that separate
offenders were co-sentenced co-offenders if they were sentenced
in different
cases but on the same date, at the same court location, and with similar
presentment numbers.
We assumed that, in the higher courts, there were 5 related pairs of
offenders (in 10 separate cases) where sentencing remarks were
not available. We
also assumed that, in the Magistrates’ Court, there were 118 cases
comprising related groups of up to 5 co-sentenced
co-offenders where the
defendant’s names and prosecution result summaries were not available.

categorical variables, correlation was assessed by Spearman’s Rho. The 6
predictors (described as factors) chosen for further
investigation had a minimum
magnitude of Rho of 0.1, and all 6 predictors had p-values of less than 0.05.
Therefore, 6 of the 10
predictors were practically important and statistically
significant.

considered a ‘point in time’ measure of fine payment to be the only
feasible approach to this analysis due to the way
the payment data was received.
As such, not all cases in the 4.5 years from January 2017 to June 2021 had the
same follow-up period
in which we assessed whether fines were paid. The most
recent fines were imposed in April 2021 in the County Court (1 fine) and in
2021 in the Magistrates’ Court (6 fines), meaning that these fines had a
2-year follow-up period in which to assess whether
these fines were paid. All
fines were paid by July 2023. Other recent fines imposed since January 2020
included 5 fines in the County
Court and 77 fines in the Magistrates’
Court. 71% of those 82 fines were fully paid by July 2023.
payments are not recorded consistently across the three sources of fine payment
data. Where sources of fine payment data do
not agree, we have generally used
the data that suggests the higher payment.

payment) caused by a single factor (for example,
deregistration of a company),
without controlling for any other factors. It can have values of between
the factors coded from prosecution result summaries and sentencing remarks, the
post-sentence status of a company was the most
difficult to identify (i.e.
whether it had been deregistered), with 91 companies not having a status
recorded for this analysis and
4 further cases having other missing values.
These are the main reasons for the excluded cases.
correlation coefficients of the top 6 factors were statistically
significant.
the 38 individuals who cannot be deregistered, the correlation of deregistration
with non-payment increases to 0.512 for
companies only.
more general terms, an odds ratio represents the ratio of the odds in an
‘exposed’ group to the odds in an ‘unexposed’
chose a correlation coefficient of at least ±0.1 to represent a moderately
weak or better correlation with non-payment of
fines, and we calculated the odds
ratios for those factors.
were 95 cases with missing values that were excluded.
