Cappelleri & Anor v Cappelleri & Ors [2024] HCASL 325 (5 December 2024)
CAPPELLERI & ANOR
[2024] HCASL 325
first applicant seeks special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Emerton
P, McLeish and
Macaulay JJA) which dismissed an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme
Court of Victoria (Moore J).
application for special leave to appeal does not sufficiently expose any legal
issue suitable for determination by this Court
and there is no reason to doubt
the correctness of the Court of Appeal's decision. The application is therefore
an unsuitable vehicle
to consider the relationship between proceedings for a
declaration and limitation provisions.
leave to appeal is refused with the first applicant to pay the costs of the
respondents.
