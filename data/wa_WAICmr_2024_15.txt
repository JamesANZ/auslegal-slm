Khuu and City of Vincent, Re [2024] WAICmr 15 (19 December 2024)
Decision D0152024 – Published in note form only
Khuu and City of Vincent
Decision: 19 December 2024
Freedom of Information Act 1992
Schedule 1, clause 3(1)
On 12 May 2023, Minh Khuu
complainant
) applied to the City of Vincent (
) under the
Freedom of Information Act 1992
) for access to various building applications, certificates, plans
and approvals relating to a neighbouring property.
By notice of
decision dated 24 May 2023, the agency decided to refuse access to the documents
identified within the scope of the access
application (
the disputed
), on the basis they are exempt under clause 3(1) of Schedule 1 to
the FOI Act (
clause 3(1)
). The agency also advised the complainant that
some of the requested documents do not exist and that, having taken all
steps to find those documents, access was refused under section 26 of
the FOI Act.
The complainant applied for internal review of the
agency’s decision to refuse access to the disputed documents and the
confirmed its decision.
On 3 July 2023, the complainant applied
to the Information Commissioner (
the Commissioner
) for external review of
the agency’s decision. The Commissioner obtained the disputed documents
from the agency, together
with the FOI file maintained by the agency in respect
of the access application.
On 12 April 2024, one of the
Commissioner’s officers provided the parties with their assessment of the
). It was the officer’s assessment that the
Commissioner was likely to be of the view, based on the information before her,
that the disputed documents are exempt under clause 3(1).
complainant did not accept the officer’s assessment and provided further
submissions. After considering all of the material
before her, including the
disputed documents, the officer’s assessment and the complainant’s
further submissions, the
Commissioner agreed that the disputed documents were
exempt under clause 3(1).
Clause 3(1) provides that matter is exempt
matter if its disclosure would reveal personal information about an individual
living or dead). Personal information is exempt under clause 3(1)
subject to the application of the limits on the exemption set
out in clauses
3(2) to 3(6).
The Commissioner was satisfied that disclosure of the
disputed documents would reveal personal information about individuals and that
they were therefore, on their face, exempt under clause 3(1).
complainant asserted that the owner of the neighbouring property consented to
the disclosure of their name, address and signature
and that the limit on the
exemption in clause 3(5) applied. However, there was no information before the
Commissioner to support
that assertion and in, any event, the disputed documents
contained more than that type of personal information. The Commissioner
that the limit in clause 3(5) did not apply.
The Commissioner considered
the only limit on the exemption that may apply to the disputed documents was
clause 3(6). Clause 3(6)
provides that matter is not exempt under clause 3(1)
if its disclosure would, on balance, be in the public interest. Under section
102(3), the onus was on the complainant, as the access applicant, to establish
that disclosure of the disputed documents would, on
balance, be in the public
As no restrictions or conditions can be placed upon the release
of documents under the FOI Act, it is well established that disclosure
information under the FOI Act is disclosure to the world at large: see
Transport Authority
[2018] WASC 47
. Accordingly, when considering
whether or not to disclose documents under the FOI Act, the effects of
disclosure are generally considered
as though disclosure were to the world,
rather than only to the particular access applicant.
Determining whether
or not disclosure would, on balance, be in the public interest involves
identifying the relevant competing public
interests for and against disclosure,
weighing them against each other and making a judgment as to where the balance
lies in the
circumstances of each particular case.
In favour of
disclosure, the Commissioner recognised the public interest in the
accountability of agencies for the manner in which
they discharge their
functions and obligations. The Commissioner also recognised public interests in
the actions and decisions of
agencies being as transparent as possible and in
the public having confidence that agencies properly perform their functions
in this case, any regulatory functions performed by the agency.
However, having regard to the contents of the disputed documents
information the complainant had already been provided, the Commissioner was not
persuaded that disclosure of the disputed
documents would further those public
Weighing against disclosure, the Commissioner recognised a
strong public interest in maintaining personal privacy and noted that this
public interest may only be displaced by some other strong or compelling public
interest or interests that require the disclosure
of personal information about
one person to another person.
The Commissioner noted that the objects of
the FOI Act are to make the persons and bodies that are responsible for State
government more accountable to the public, not to call to account or
unnecessarily intrude upon the privacy of private individuals,
where there is no
demonstrable benefit to the public interest in doing so.
The complainant
contended that, in this case, the public interest in the protection of personal
interests and, in support of his
arguments, referred to decisions of the former Information Commissioner (
former Commissioner
Re ‘R’ and City of Greater Geraldton
[2012] WAICmr 25
Re Shuttleworth and Town of Victoria Park
[2016] WAICmr 13
Shuttleworth
, the personal
information in question consisted of an address, the name of an individual, and
the size and certain external features
of the building on a property. The
former Commissioner considered the personal information was not of a
particularly private or
sensitive nature and was not persuaded that the public
interest in the protection of the third party’s privacy outweighed the
public interests in favour of disclosure.
In contrast to
, the Commissioner considered that disclosure of the disputed
documents in this case, which relate to a private home, would reveal
information of a private nature and that the public interest in the protection
of privacy was strong.
Re Shuttleworth
, the disputed document
was a statutory declaration, executed under the
Oaths, Affidavits and
Statutory Declarations Act 2005
(WA), that had been provided to an agency to
verify that certain work had been carried out on a block prior to its
subdivision and
sale as a strata titled block. The complainant in that case had
acted in reliance on the statutory declaration and suffered a detriment
so. The former Commissioner considered there was a strong public interest in a
person who had suffered a detriment in reliance
on a statutory declaration being
able to seek redress or compensation.
The Commissioner noted that this
matter did not involve documents executed under the same legal framework as
Re Shuttleworth.
Consequently, the Commissioner considered the context
and basis of the documents in each case were different, and did not consider
that the comparison made by the complainant was applicable or
persuasive.
The Commissioner considered the circumstances of this matter
were very different from those in
Shuttleworth
and gave different weight to the competing public interest
factors in this case.
In balancing the competing public interests, the
Commissioner concluded that the public interests favouring disclosure of the
documents were not sufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in
the protection of the personal privacy of other individuals.
Therefore, the
Commissioner was not persuaded that disclosure of the disputed documents would,
on balance, be in the public interest
and found that the limit on the exemption
in clause 3(6) did not apply.
Accordingly, the Commissioner found that
the disputed documents are exempt under clause 3(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act
and confirmed
the agency’s decision.
