REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is the determination of several applications for review. The first was dated 1
July 2010, lodged by the applicant employer pursuant
to section 72 (as it then
stood) of the
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
(“the Act”), seeking a review of a decision of the respondent
WorkCover Corporation of South Australia (“WorkCover”)
assessing the
applicant’s levy for its “administration centre” (which we
think is Location 9011) on the basis of
a particular industry classification.
The application did not identify the decision, but presumably referred to the
notice of assessment
for the 2010-11 financial year, which was dated 4 June
Subsequently,
the scope of the disputes between the applicant and WorkCover has been broadened
considerably. A second application
was lodged dated 16 July 2010 in relation to
the employer’s Location 12, which it contended ought to be classified as
830401 Residential Care Services
. This also presumably referred to the
notice dated 4 June 2010 in relation to the 2010-11 year.
the end of 2010, Mr Johns of Lawson Smith Lawyers was instructed to act for the
applicant, and by letter dated 23 December
2010 challenged the levies imposed in
respect of “each and every” of the applicant’s worksites,
which at that stage
seems to have numbered 18 (the number of assessments
attached to WorkCover’s notice of 4 June 2010). That was taken to be a
third application. Its scope appears to subsume the first two applications, with
the caveat that it was probably out of time, whereas
the first two applications
probably were not.
letter of Mr Johns dated 31 August 2011 shows the grounds for review also had
shifted, or perhaps simply clarified, focussing almost
entirely on the
applicant’s undoubted status as a not-for-profit organisation. This was
also how the application was argued
at the hearing before us.
is also a fourth application, dated 24 October 2012, seeking review of the
corresponding reviewable decisions referable to the
2012-13 year, the date of
those decisions being 15 August 2012.
72, at the relevant time when the first three applications were lodged, provided
(1) Where an employer considers that a decision of the Corporation as
(aa) the estimate of remuneration that is to be used for the calculation of a
(a) the fixing or assessment of a levy; or
(b) the imposition of penalty interest or a fine; or
(c) the imposition or variation of a condition of a kind that may lead to the
imposition of a supplementary levy,
is unreasonable, the board must, on application by the employer, review the
(2) An application for review does not suspend a liability to pay a levy,
penalty interest or a fine.
(3) The review will be conducted, in accordance with procedures determined
by the board, by the board itself, or by a committee or
person to whom the board
has delegated its powers of review under this section, and the board has an
absolute discretion as to whether
it will permit the employer or a
representative of the employer to be heard orally on the review.
(4) On review, the board may—
(aa) alter an estimate;
(a) alter a levy or an assessment;
(b) quash or reduce penalty interest or a fine;
(c) direct the repayment of amounts overpaid;
(d) quash or vary a condition imposed by the Corporation.
(5) An application under this section for review of a decision of the
Corporation—
(a) must, if the decision relates to a class of employer, be made within four
months after notice of the decision was given;
(b) must, if the decision relates to an individual employer, be made within
two months after the employer was given notice of the
unless the Board (or its delegate) allows an extension of time for making the
application.
72 was repealed from 1 July 2012 by the
Workers Rehabilitation and
Compensation (Employer Payments) Amendment Act 2012
and replaced by a new
section 72M in terms that are, for practical purposes, identical. This Panel was
the Board’s delegate
for the purpose of a review under section 72: see the
WorkCover Levy Review Determination 2002
, as amended (see
Australian Government Gazette
, 3 July 2008, p.3196, for a consolidation
encompassing the most recent amendments), and is the Board’s delegate for
the purpose
of a review under section 72M:
WorkCover Premium Review Panel
Determination 2012
South Australian Government Gazette
2012, p.1617). Again, the differences are not material, but the 2012
Determination directs that a review lodged before, or
referring to a levy period
before, 1 July 2012 will be conducted under the 2002 Determination.
1 July 2012, the terminology of “levy” has been changed to
“statutory payment” or “premium”.
Given the historical
period dealt with by the first three applications, it will be convenient to use
the term “levy”
throughout these reasons.
the hearing of this matter, sworn evidence was given by Nicholas Mihalaras,
Chief Executive Officer of the applicant and Lee Anthony
Hayford, Manager
Premium Business of WorkCover. Both Mr Manuel, for the applicant, and Mr Wait,
for WorkCover, kindly prepared written
outlines of submissions and elaborated on
them orally. We are indebted to both counsel for their careful and thorough
expositions.
Background facts
an older generation of South Australians, the applicant is better known as the
Mentally Retarded Children’s Society of South
Australia, the name under
which it was founded in 1950 and continued to operate until it changed to its
present name in 1980. As
the publication
Making A Difference: 60 years of
Service in South Australia
(published 2010)
“Orana was formed in 1950 by a small group of
progressive and visionary parents who were seeking educational and training
opportunities
for their children with intellectual disabilities who previously
had been denied access to such opportunities.
“Before 1950 the only specialised service for people with intellectual
disabilities in SA was Minda Incorporated, which had
been established in 1898 to
provide accommodation and care for children. There were no educational, training
or vocational services
for children and young people with more severe levels of
intellectual disabilities, and as a consequence the children were kept at
in the care of their parents.
“However, as a result of a public meeting held in Adelaide on August
10, 1950 and attended by more than 80 parents, the Mentally
Children’s Society, now Orana, was formed.
“The primary concern of that first meeting had been the total lack of
educational services for children with intellectual disabilities,
extensive campaigning and political lobbying by the newly formed Mentally
Retarded Children’s Society, the first
educational and training service
was established in South Australia. Known as the Kent Town Occupational Centre,
the service was
opened in 1953 to provide special tuition and training for
children whose level of intellectual disability was below that required
entry into the then Education Department’s opportunity classes. Although
the Centre was run by the Education Department,
its establishment was the
Society’s first major achievement and was a great encouragement to members
of the inaugural Management
Committee. The ages of the children ranged from an
entry age of 6 to a leaving age of 16.”
Society opened the first facilities conducted by itself in 1958, to attend to
the vocational needs of young adults beyond school
energetic fundraising activities and a degree of government support, the Society
soon had a network of facilities throughout
the state. By 1980, it was providing
services to nearly 450 people, with a staff of over 70 people and an operating
expenditure in
the order of $1.5 million. This included a series of sheltered
workshops or adult training centres, now known as Supported Employment
The new title of the centres, adopted in 1987, was intended to acknowledge
“that the Centres were there to provide long term employment
for people with intellectual disabilities who needed ongoing support
participate in a work setting. Where previously the service users had been
referred to as trainees they became known as Orana
employees.”
2010-2011, as shown by the reviewable decision before us, the applicant had a
total of 18 metropolitan and country locations, at
Netley (2), Ridleyton, Port
Augusta, Clarence Park, Port Pirie South (2), Loxton (2), Berri, Richmond,
Murray Bridge, Whyalla, Wingfield
(2), Meningie (2), and Mount Gambier.
Netley locations (designated as locations 9011 and 9012) were classified by
WorkCover as
638801 Contract Packing Services
, as were both Wingfield
location (locations 9004 and 9005). One of the Netley locations was said to be
the applicant’s head
office, where administrative activities were carried
out. The Ridleyton location (location 0001) was classified as
Fabricated Metal Products Manufacturing Nec
. The Port Augusta location
(location 0011) was classified as
489701 Retailing Nec
. The Clarence Park
location (location 0012) was
classified as
814301 Personal Care
. The Port Pirie South locations (locations 0013 and 0007) were
classified as
830401 Residential Care Services
254101 Furniture
Manufacturing, Reupholstery, French Polishing, Shopfitting Manufacture and
Installation Nec (excl sheet metal)
respectively. The Berri (location 0015)
and Richmond locations (location 0019) and one of the Loxton locations (location
each also classified as
830401 Residential Care Services
Murray Bridge location (location 0021) was classified as
254101 Furniture
Manufacturing, Reupholstery, French Polishing, Shopfitting Manufacture and
Installation Nec (excl sheet metal)
, as was the Mount Gambier location
(location 9006). The Whyalla location (location 0022) was classified as
815701 Community Health Centres (Paramedical)
. The second Loxton location
(location 0008) was classified as
234001 Yarns and Broadwoven Fabrics
Manufacturing
. The Meningie locations (locations 9007 and 9008) were
classified as
830501 Welfare and Charitable Services Nec
Plant Nurseries
respectively.
appearing in the books of documents before us (at tab 43 of WorkCover’s
books) reveal that for the first six months
of the WorkCover scheme (30
September 1987 to 31 March 1988), location 1 at Ridleyton was classified as
830501 Welfare and Charitable Services Nec
, and from 1 April 1988 to 30
June 1995 as
830507 Sheltered Workshop Operation Nec
. From 1 July 1995 to
30 November 2004, it was
638801 Contract Packing Services Nec
was classified as
316801 Fabricated Metal Products Manufacturing Nec
between 1 December 2004 and 30 June 2011, before reverting to
638801 Contract
Packing Services Nec
on 1 July 2011.
7 at Port Pirie South was also classified initially as
830501 Welfare and
Charitable Services Nec
, and from 1 April 1988 to 30 June 1995 as
Sheltered Workshop Operation Nec
, before being classified between 1 July
1995 and 30 November 2004 as
345201 Leather and Leather Substitute Product
Manufacturing Nec
. From 1 December 2004 and 30 June 2011 it was classified
254101 Furniture Manufacturing, Reupholstery, French Polishing,
Shopfitting Manufacture and Installation Nec (excl sheet metal)
638801 Contract Packing Services Nec
since 1 July 2011.
8 at Loxton was also classified initially as
830501 Welfare and Charitable
Services Nec
, and from 1 April 1988 to 30 June 1995 as
830507 Sheltered
Workshop Operation Nec
, before being classified between 1 July 1995 and 30
June 2010 as
020601 Services to Agriculture Nec
. The classification of
234001 Yarns and Broadwoven Fabrics Manufacturing
, mentioned above, seems
to have endured for only one year before being replaced by
638801 Contract
Packing Services Nec
from 1 July 2011.
11 at Port Augusta has maintained the classification of
489701 Retailing
since 1987.
12 at Clarence Park, known as Amaroo Hostel, was classified as
Accommodation
between 30 September 1987 and 30 November 1995 and was then
classified as
830401 Welfare and Charitable Homes Nec
until 30 June 1997,
since when it has been classified, according to the printout, as
Nursing or Convalescent Homes Providing Nursing (Personal) or Medical Care
As noted by the Panel in
Leveda v. WorkCover (No.2)
[2004] SAWLRP
(at [5] to [8]), the title of this classification has changed from time to
time, and is now
814301 Personal Care Services
13 at Port Pirie South, known as Port Pirie Hostel, had the same history as the
Amaroo Hostel until 30 June 1998, when it
reverted from
814301 Nursing or
Convalescent Homes Providing Nursing (Personal) or Medical Care
830401 Welfare and Charitable Homes Nec
. As also noted in
, the 830401 classification has also changed its title and is now
830401 Residential Care Services
classification histories of location 14 at Loxton, known as Loxton Hostel,
location 15 at Berri, known as Biralee Hostel, and
location 19 at Richmond,
known as Metropolitan Community Living Program, are identical to that of the
Port Pirie Hostel.
21 at Murray Bridge was classified initially as
830501 Welfare and Charitable
Services Nec
, and in case, that classification lasted until 30 June 1995.
From 1 July 1995 to 30 November 2004 it was
638801 Contract Packing Services
, and from 1 December 2004 until 30 June 2011 it was classified as
254101 Furniture Manufacturing, Reupholstery, French Polishing, Shopfitting
Manufacture and Installation Nec (excl sheet metal)
, until it reverted to
638801 Contract Packing Services Nec
from 1 July 2011.
22 at Whyalla, known as Orana Respite Service, was first registered on 4
December 1989 and was classified as

classified as
638801 Contract Packing Services Nec
since then.
9006 at Loxton was first registered on 1 September 1999 and has held the
classification of
638801 Contract Packing Services Nec
since then, apart
from the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, when it was classified as

registered on 15 November 2010, after the initial applications
for review were
lodged. It was classified as
638801 Contract Packing Services Nec
30 June 2011, and
830401 Residential Care Services
thereafter.
broad range of classifications allocated by WorkCover both currently and over
the period of the WorkCover scheme probably serves
fairly to illustrate the wide
range of activities undertaken by the applicant, albeit the appropriateness of
many classifications
is disputed in these proceedings.
applicant’s case
applicant’s primary submission was that “the classification of all
locations of the Applicant ought to reflect the
charitable nature and purpose of
all of the Applicant’s services.”
submission described locations 1, 7, 8, 11, 21, 9004, 9005, 9006, 9008 and 9012
as “Employment Services locations”
and said each of them should
correctly be classified as
848201 Community Organisations Nec for Promotion
of Community or Sectional Interests
830501 Welfare and Charitable
824401 Education Nec
990001 Non Classifiable
Economic Unit
(presumably in that order of preference).
described locations 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 22 and 9007 as “Accommodation
Services locations” and contended each of them
should correctly be
classified as
848201 Community Organisations Nec for Promotion of Community
or Sectional Interests
830501 Welfare and Charitable Services Nec
830401 Residential Care Services
(again, presumably in that order of
preference).
described location 9011 as the “state office” of the applicant,
which the submission acknowledged is classified consistently
WorkCover’s policy that administrative locations are to be classified in
accordance with the predominant industry supported.
It argued that WorkCover
appeared to have assumed that location 9011 supports only location 9012, next
door, which provides employment
services, whereas it in fact supports all
locations throughout the state, which are charitable services comprising both
and accommodation services. It contended the correct classification
of location 9011 should be
848201 Community Organisations Nec for Promotion
of Community or Sectional Interests
830501 Welfare and Charitable
Services Nec
990001 Non Classifiable Economic Unit
presumably in that order of preference).
applicant contended that all of its locations were engaged in “the
industry of providing charitable services” and
it was therefore incorrect
to look for any other predominant class of industry. Alternatively, it argued,
if it was found to be engaged
in more than one class of industry, the
predominant industry must be determined having regard to only relevant
considerations.
said the relevant considerations to which WorkCover should have, but did not,
give any or adequate consideration were:
the predominant
industry of the applicant being services to the intellectually disabled
the nature,
purpose and importance of the training activities provided by the
the charitable
nature and purpose of the applicant;
the status of
the applicant with other state and federal government bodies and in the
community as a government funded not-for-profit
community organisation;
the nature,
purpose and importance of the “employment activities” within the
services provided by the applicant;
the distinct
rôles of the applicant’s staff (who were said to provide services to
clients) and the applicant’s “employees”
(who were said to be
clients of the applicant at employment services locations); and
the purpose of
the Act and the imposition of levies.
identified the irrelevant considerations to which WorkCover should not have had
application of WorkCover policies;
administrative
convenience to WorkCover; and
classifications of the applicant.
said WorkCover had misdirected itself in treating the applicant as a commercial
undertaking, instead of a charitable undertaking,
which had led to the
application of clearly inappropriate levy rates and the placing of
administrative convenience above a fair and
rational assessment. Reference was

(SA Branch)

[1991] HCA 33

of South Australia
(1995) 184 CLR 163
[1995] HCA 58.
applicant’s submission also asserted that WorkCover had failed to provide
any or any adequate reasons for the disputed decisions.
Reasons, it contended,
are critical in enabling an employer to make an appropriate assessment of the
decision by the applicant. Reference
was made to
Beale v. Government
Insurance Office of NSW
(1987) 48 NSWLR 430
determination of the predominant industry in which the applicant employs
workers, the submission contended, requires consideration
to be given to the
true nature and purpose of the applicant’s services. It said the applicant
does not easily fit within the
concept of “industry” and this makes
it extremely difficult to determine which is predominant. It said that, as with
most complex administrative structures, there are always exceptions to the rule
and described the applicant as a classic example
of that. It said that it was
not easily defined in terms of industry as the only continuous theme in the
various employment activities
provided is that they allow meaningful work and
skills training and development, and it was virtually impossible to determine a
predominant
industry, other than it being charitable.
summary, it said the applicant is a charitable organisation and its industry
classification should reflect this. The applicant
is a provider of services to
intellectually disabled people by supporting them in engaging with the community
through life skills
training, meaningful work, and/or appropriate accommodation
and social interaction.
Manuel expanded on the written submission in oral argument.
said the applicant fully acknowledges that a public service-style organisation
such as WorkCover must have “tick-a-box”
style tests, but the
applicant doesn’t fit perfectly into the categories established. Massive
increases in statutory payments
have had a massive impact on the
applicant’s ability to carry out its mandate. He said that WorkCover had
failed to have regard
to the nature of the employment, and referred to
Ermogenous v. Greek Orthodox Community of SA
[2002] HCA 8
AMP v. Chaplin
[1978] UKPC 7
(1978) 18 ALR 385.
questioned whether the bulk of the workers were really workers at all. Reference
was made to federal awards relating to persons
with disabilities, and he likened
the supervisors to social workers, managing the disabled and supervising their
WorkCover’s response
argued that WorkCover had appropriately classified the applicant’s
workplaces. Consistently with the scheme of the
Act, Mr Wait said in his written
submission, on which he elaborated orally at the hearing, an assessment of each
workplace has been
made, turning on activities undertaken at that location, not
on the benevolence of the purpose for which that activity is undertaken.
would be inappropriate and erroneous to reclassify these locations in accordance
with the applicant’s overriding purposes.
submissions contended that to approach the classification of workplaces under
the Act in terms of purpose rather than activities
would lead to error. Mr Wait
said the reason for conferring on WorkCover the power to divide industries
carried on in the state into
various classes and fix rates in relation to each
class is to allow for variations in the contributions that different industries
make to the Fund according to the risk of injury associated with each industry.
He argued that risk attaches to the activities undertaken
in different
industries, not the purposes for which those activities are undertaken. This
would draw WorkCover, and this Panel on
review, into making subjective judgments
WorkCover’s
submission contended that the SAWIC system leads inevitably to the approach of
focusing on activities and the SAWIC
system itself arises from a Board decision
under section 69(1) of the Act. (That is new section 69(1). New section 69(1) is
the equivalent
of old section 66(3).) Reviews of decisions under new section
69(1) are not delegated to this Panel under the
WorkCover Premium Review
Panel Determination 2012
(nor, it might have been added, were reviews of
decisions under the old section 66(3) delegated under the old
WorkCover Levy
Review Determination 2002
also contended that the applicant focused inappropriately on the rôle of
employees who supervise and assist persons
suffering disability without giving
sufficient weight to the activities engaged in by clients suffering disability
as workers or
trainees remunerated whilst receiving on-the-job training. The
submission contended that no particular weighting should be given
category of worker over other groups of workers.
and findings
application, at least in terms of the way it was argued, in our opinion goes to
the fundamentals of the WorkCover scheme.

Parliament. It is not an insurance scheme: see

as to the essential nature of the statutory payment as a tax remains to be
statutory payments are assessed by WorkCover, as the administering authority
under the Act, subject to the constraints of the
Act. The first step is to
divide the industries carried on in the state into classes (old section 66(3);
new section 69(1)). The
use of the permissive “may” in this regard
should not mislead; no other practical way of doing it is suggested. The only
real alternative would be to charge exactly the same rate to every employer in
the state; the succeeding detailed provisions clearly
indicate that is not the
parliamentary intention.
is defined inclusively by section 3(1):
includes any business or activity in which workers are employed ...
industries are divided into classes, WorkCover is required to fix percentages
applicable to the various classes (old section
66(6); new section 70(1)), not
exceeding (in general terms) 7.5% (old section 66(7); new section 70(3)). These
are the percentages
of payroll (remuneration as defined) payable as the
statutory payment, subject to a number of qualifications that are not relevant
to this case.
these processes, the SAWIC (South Australian WorkCover Industry Classifications)
schedule is derived and published, for the most
part annually, in the
Australian Government Gazette
(for example, in relation to the years most
relevant to this matter, 27 May 2010 at p.2077, 9 June 2011 at p.2020, 17 May
is noticeable is that Parliament has not seen fit, in any of this, to make any
special provision for charities or not-for-profit
organisations. The policy
reason for this is obvious, both from the title of the Act, and the enumerated
objectives that were inserted
into the Act in 1994 (section 2). The Act is about
establishing a framework for the rehabilitation and compensation of injured
, whatever the circumstances of their employment. As long as a
not-for-profit employs workers, there is a risk one of those workers
injured, and they are not to be discriminated against on the basis of the
objectives of their employers. Nor are the employers,
in regards the funding of
the scheme, to be discriminated against, or in favour of, on the basis of their
objectives.
these principles were to be revisited, it would be a matter for Parliament, not
for WorkCover or this Panel.
definition of “industry”, set out above, seems to us to be
scrupulously neutral as between for-profit employers and
not-for-profits. In
case “business” sounds awkward when applied to a not-for-profit,
“activity” is given
as an alternative. In fact, many not-for-profits
engage in business activities, including this one. They may run thrift shops or
craft outlets or, as in this case, they may sell the products made in factories
that used to be referred to as sheltered workshops.
Profit may result, but in
the case of a not-for-profit such as the applicant in this case, those profits
will be ploughed back into
the provision of the not-for-profit services rather
than into the dividends of shareholders.
any event, the word “activity”, which carries its everyday English
meaning in this context, covers anything done at
any of the applicant’s
locations that is not included in the word “business”. We are
comfortably satisfied that
the applicant is included in an
industry carried
on in the state
within the meaning of the Act.
do not consider it necessary for us to make detailed findings on the businesses
or activities conducted at each of the locations.
The case was not conducted, on
either side, on the basis that this was necessary, although some evidence of
activities conducted
may be extracted from the statements and sworn evidence of
Mr Mihilaras and Mr Hayford and there was some supplementation, not disputed,
from “the bar table”. The evidence of particular activities at
particular locations, such as it was, satisfies us, for
the most part, that the
existing classifications appropriately correspond with those activities, with
one possible exception we will
mention below.
do not overlook Mr Manuel’s point that (old) section 66(5)(c) (and its
counterpart in new section 69(3)(d)) directs, in determining
“predominant class of industry” (where that test is applicable),
that “any other relevant factor” be
taken into account. We cannot
accept, however, that these words are intended to import an ability to use an
employer’s charitable
status to over-ride the clear parliamentary
intention conveyed by the structure of the rest of the provisions.
also do not overlook Mr Manuel’s point as to whether the disabled workers
employed by the applicant are truly workers at
all. However, we do not think the
employer can have it both ways on this point. It prides itself on giving its
the opportunity of earning a productive living by styling
them as employees with “meaningful” work, rather than trainees
we note that even trainees are included in the definition of workers under the
Act). There are special award arrangements to
recognise their reduced level of
productivity with wages lower than might otherwise be applicable. This has the
result, given that
industry rates are a percentage of remuneration, of rewarding
the employers of such workers with lower statutory payments in any
event. We do
not see that either the case of
or the case of
has any bearing on the status of workers with
disabilities; there cannot be any doubt that contractual relations exist between
parties, however informal, nor that normal
of a contract of
service have been deliberately imported into the contractual relationship
— for the very best of motives —
by the applicant itself. Nor do we
think any distinction is to be drawn from the fact that some of the disabled
workers live in premises
owned by their employer, whether the same premises in
which they work or elsewhere.
63. We do not think that recourse to section 15 of the
WorkCover Corporation
takes the argument any
further. It would absurdly stretch the terms of that provision to imagine that
WorkCover was required by the
section to promote the employability of persons
with “some physical, mental or intellectual impairment” by charging
employers reduced statutory payments resulting in higher statutory
payments for every other employer. If Parliament had intended
that result, it
would have said so.
also consider that the administrative law principles referred to by Mr Manuel,
as to the processes by which WorkCover reached the
decisions under review, are
of limited relevance in this matter, for reasons the Panel has mentioned in such
Skilled Engineering v. WorkCover (No.2)
[2001] SAWLRP 11
at p.14 and
Henderson’s Automotive v WorkCover (No.2)
. These proceedings are not analogous to judicial review
proceedings in the Supreme Court, for reasons the Panel has set out on many
occasions, we consider the review provided for by old section 72 and new section
72M to be a merits review calling upon us to make
determination
of the matters in dispute (e.g.,
Plaspak v. WorkCover
Plaspak v. WorkCover (No. 2)
[2000] SAWLRP 4
Benchmark Healthcare v WorkCover (No. 2)
[2009] SAWLRP 17
Australian Independent Contractors & Ors v WorkCover
[2012] SAWLRP 1
). At least as part of the re-consideration process
envisaged by the
WorkCover Levy Review Determination 2002
WorkCover Premium Review Panel Determination 2012
, it is expected
WorkCover will state reasons, but any failure on WorkCover’s part to give
reasons for its initial decision
is not what gives us our jurisdiction, nor does
such failure have any particular result in these proceedings. Our jurisdiction
enlivened by an employer’s declaration that it considers a relevant
reviewable decision unreasonable; what governs the result
of a review is the
merits of the application as shown by the evidence and the arguments. The
existence of a full review with a hearing
and fully detailed
reasons is likely to cure any defects in procedural fairness below: see, for
Elderly Citizens Homes v WorkCover
[1999] SASC 133
, per Debelle J.
his learned submissions for WorkCover, Mr Wait indicated that WorkCover agreed
with the applicant that location 9007 (Meningie)
should be classified as
830501 Welfare and Charitable Services nec
, as it has been since 2010. As
we understand the position, that does not indicate a change of stance by
WorkCover. He indicated that
location 12 (Clarence Park) should be classified as
814301 Personal Care Services
because the evidence indicates that some,
albeit limited, personal care is undertaken. This is consistent with the
approach to that classification in
Leveda (No.2)
mentioned above, and also does not indicate a change of stance by WorkCover. In
our respectful view, there is no basis on which
the Panel ought to depart from
the approach it took in
Leveda (No.2)
Wait also said that location 22 (Whyalla) should be either
830401 Residential
Care Services
814301 Personal Care Services
, but WorkCover would
be content for the location to be classified as
830401 Residential Care
by the Panel, perhaps pending further investigation by WorkCover
and further reclassification in the future. The Panel notes that
classification carries a slightly lower rate (5.1% in 2013-14) than
Personal Care Services
(7.1%), but both are higher than the current
classification of
815701 Community Health Centres (Paramedical)
We do not propose to alter the classification of this location, in isolation,
from that chosen by WorkCover in 1995 while
further investigations by WorkCover
are pending. If at the end of those investigations WorkCover chooses to amend
the present classification,
the applicant will obviously have the right to seek
review of that decision at that time.
two locations at Netley are both currently classified as
638801 Contract
Packing Services Nec
. We are comfortably satisfied that this is an
appropriate classification, fairly corresponding with the activities carried out
location 9012. Location 9011, which is next door, is the organisation’s
head office, and we are informed (and it is not disputed)
that no contract
packing is performed there. The classification results from WorkCover’s
view that the head office is an ancillary
unit of an organisation which has, as
the predominant code across its entire operations,
638801 Contract Packing
Services Nec
reasons this Panel explained in its recent decision in
Shahin Enterprises
v WorkCover
[2014] SAWPRP 1
, this approach is not in accordance with the
Act and is not sustainable. Administration is a legitimate activity and comes
the definition of “industry” in its own right. If an office
is attached to, say, a factory, and the predominant activity
the single workplace
is the substantive productive activity of the factory,
then the Act (old section 66(5)(b); new section 69(3)(c)) permits that all
workers at that single workplace may be treated as being engaged in the
predominant class of industry. This is not the case where
the administration is
carried on at a separate workplace.
, there was no doubt that the administration centre was a
stand-alone workplace. It was not adjacent to a place where petrol or tobacco
retailing was conducted. In the present case, we wondered whether the requisite
degree of separation between locations 9011 and 9012
was really in existence at
Netley or whether the two should be treated as a single workplace where the
“predominant class”
test might be appropriate. We were told that
there is a “massive wall” between the two workplaces and that it is
to walk “a long way” to get from one to the other.
is arguable that WorkCover has in effect conceded the issue by registering and
charging the two as separate locations for several
years. However, we must
acknowledge that WorkCover has done that on the basis of its belief,
, that it was legitimate to classify an administrative
centre, even one completely separate from any substantive operational location,
in accordance with the predominant industry
of the employer as a whole
which, as we said in
, is an approach that is not reflective
of the provisions of the Act. We must also acknowledge that the present matter
decision was published, and the
parties were therefore not in a position to present evidence or advance argument
in the light of
that decision.
Panel, after some hesitation, has decided it does owe the parties an opportunity
to make submissions in the light of
. We do not think it
should be necessary to call the matter back on live, unless there is a serious
factual dispute requiring the
cross-examination of deponents, but we invite
written submissions, in a fairly limited time frame, specifically on the factual
of the administrative centre (Location 9011
Location 9012) and the application to it of the approach the Panel took in
. A detailed physical description, perhaps supplemented with
photographs, could be useful to us in the making of clear factual findings.
any dispute is likely in relation to the facts, evidence would best be presented
in sworn form so that there are identifiable
witnesses for cross-examination,
but it would be our hope that this should not become necessary.
we be satisfied that Location 9011 ought to be classified in such a way as to
reflect its administrative character, we tentatively
foreshadow the following.
As the Panel noted in
, and earlier in
Adventure Tours
v. WorkCover
[2007] SAWLRP 2
, the SAWIC schedules are short on purely
administrative classifications. In the present case, however, we would be
inclined to think
830506 Charities and Community Services
reasonably well. We would be inclined to select this classification rather than
848201 Community organisations nec for promotion of community or Sectional
, as the applicant is engaged in actually providing services, not
merely promotion. The parties may wish to address these observations
submissions.
Extension of time
already noted, there are four applications before the Panel. The first was dated
1 July 2010, and is taken to refer to a reviewable
decision that was dated
4 June 2010. The second was dated 16 July 2010 and is also taken to refer to a
reviewable decision dated
4 June 2010. The third was dated 23 December 2010 and
may also be taken to refer to a series of decisions (including those encompassed
by the first two applications) dated 4 June 2010. The fourth application was
dated 24 October 2012 and referred to reviewable decisions
dated 15 August
time for the making of an application for review, under either old section 72 or
new section 72M, is “within 2 months after
the employer was given notice
of the decision”. On that basis, the third and fourth applications must be
regarded as out of
time, by over four months in the case of the third
application and by less than nine days in the case of the fourth
application
have left this topic until last, preferring to examine the merits of the
applicant’s arguments, because the classifications
represent an ongoing
situation that are the subject of regular (at least annual) reviewable
decisions, so that the opportunity to
lodge an in-time application for review
presents itself on a similarly regular basis. The merits of the applications
currently before
the Panel are going to have to be addressed at some stage, and
it seems to us that proceeding as we have is in conformity with the
objective of
reducing litigation mentioned in section 2(1)(f) of the Act. The issue of
extensions of time goes, from this point of
view, primarily to the operative
date of any changes we might have made.
first and second applications were not pressed separately at the hearing, as
they were no doubt regarded as having been subsumed
into the third decision. We
did not, however, understand those applications to have been formally abandoned
and we treat them as
opposed any extension of time, primarily on the basis that there was no, or no
adequate, explanation of the delay. The applicant
argued that a refusal to
extend time would give WorkCover an unjustified windfall. The case of
v. City of Burnside
[2006] SASC 283
(2006) 102 SASR 298
, among others,
was referred to. That case related to an extension of time sought to lodge an
application for judicial review in the
Supreme Court, where the time for lodging
was six months and the limit was exceeded by almost four months. Mr Wait
particularly pressed
upon us the following passage from the judgment of Doyle
CJ, at [49]:
“The relatively short limitation period reflects
the fact that judicial review is concerned with the validity of decision making
by individuals and bodies exercising statutory and other powers that must be
exercised in the public interest. Such decisions often
have direct and
consequential effects on persons other than those immediately affected. In a
range of circumstances it will often
be a matter of significance for other
persons and authorities to know whether or not such a decision is valid or has
been subject
to a legal challenge. There is a substantial public interest in
being able to say, after a specified time, that such a decision
can be treated
as beyond attack. The very fact that the standing rules permit challenges to
validity to be made by persons other
than those directly involved in the
decision making process is a reason why there should be a relatively short
period within which
any such attack should be mounted.”
do not consider anything in the approach this Panel has taken in cases such as
Adventure Tours
(cited above at [
Camms Group v. WorkCover
[2008] SAWLRP 4
Orbit Products v. WorkCover
Alsco v WorkCover (No.2)
[2012] SAWPRP 9
inconsistent with His Honour’s observations, and happily adopt them as,
indeed, we must.
given that, in the result on the merits, we have found that, at the most, the
only classification that should be changed
is that of location 9011, the subject
of the first application (not out of time), there is no need to consider any
issue of extensions
of time further. On the basis of our decision as to location
9011, any change to the statutory payment we make after final submissions
take effect from 1 July 2010, and this should carry through subsequent years
without the need to consult the out-of-time
applications.
our opinion, there is no basis for the Panel to disturb the classifications of
any of the applicant’s locations, except,
perhaps, that of the
administration office at Location 9011. We will further reserve our decision in
relation to that workplace until
the parties have had the opportunity to make
the final written submissions indicated
Determination
Pursuant to our delegated powers under section 72M of the Act, we further
reserve our determination as to WorkCover’s reviewable
decision dated 4
June 2010 in relation to the applicant’s workplace location 9011, sought
by the applicant’s first application
for review.
invite the parties to submit further written submissions confined to the topics
referred to in paragraphs [
] above by close of business on Friday 27
June 2014. If the parties, or either of them, seeks to further address us orally
topics, or to cross-examine on disputed evidence, we will consider any
such request.
otherwise dismiss the applications for review before us.

15—Corporation to have regard to
various differences in the workforce
(1) The Corporation must, in carrying out its functions, take into account
racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity in the population
of the State, the
interests of both sexes, and the interests of those who may be physically,
mentally or intellectually impaired,
and seek to ensure that people who are
entitled to benefits under Acts administered by the Corporation are not
disadvantaged because
of their origins or background, their sex, or some
physical, mental or intellectual impairment.
(2) The Corporation should, as far as reasonably practicable, ensure that
information provided for use in the workplace is in a language
appropriate for those expected to make use of it.
Since the two months does not
begin to run until the employer is “given notice” of the decision,
which we take to mean
the employer
the notice, section 117(2) is
likely to be applicable, which provides that notices sent by ordinary mail are
taken to be received
two business days after posting. Nothing before us suggests
that these notices were sent electronically.
