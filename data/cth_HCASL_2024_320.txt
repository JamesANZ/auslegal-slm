applicant seeks special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Buss
P, Mitchell and Hall JJA),
granting leave to appeal and dismissing an appeal from the State Administrative
proposed appeal lacks sufficient prospects of success and it cannot be said that
the administration of justice, either generally
or in this particular case,
supports the grant of special leave.
