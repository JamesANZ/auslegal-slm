REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application, under
section 483
Property Agents and Motor Dealers
(which I shall call “the Act”), for review of a
decision of the Chief Executive made under
section 481
, in which the Chief
Executive rejected a claim by the applicant against the claim fund established
under the Act.
applicant, Martha Swinkles, alleges that she has suffered financial loss because
of breaches, by a licensed motor dealer, of
section 574
of the Act. The total
loss suffered is alleged to be $5,098.10.
Factual background
2006, L&W Motors was a registered business carried on by Marie Louise
Garnham in Nerang. Mrs Garnham and her husband, Warwick
Scott Garnham, were
licensed motor dealers: Mrs Garnham holding the principal licence and Mr Garnham
holding a salesperson’s
1 April 2006, Ms Swinkles purchased from L&W Motors a second hand Hyundai
Lantra sedan manufactured in February 1998 and with
an odometer reading of
181,187. Having regard to that odometer reading, the vehicle was a class B
warranted vehicle (as defined
in the Act) and it was sold to Ms Swinkles with a
statutory warranty of 1,000 kilometres or one month from purchase.
Swinkles gave evidence that, before she purchased the vehicle, she spoke to Mr
Garnham, who told her that the vehicle had belonged
to a friend of his whom he
had known for 20 years and, when his friend wanted to sell the vehicle, he
jumped at the chance because
his friend had always looked after his vehicles.
She asked Mr Garnham if the vehicle had ever been in an accident and he told her
that it had not. He told her that his friend’s son had been driving the
car and must have looked after it because if he hadn’t
then his father
would not have bought him a new car to start university.
the time of the transaction, Mr Garnham gave Ms Swinkles a motor vehicle safety
certificate that had been issued by an approved
examiner, Colin John Antaw, on
29 March 2006. Relevantly, that certificate had said that, on the first
inspection, the steering
and suspension had passed inspection.
Swinkles also paid for an extended warranty of one year with Integrity Extended
Warranties of Croydon, Victoria.
11 April 2006, Ms Swinkles noticed a knocking noise while driving on a rough
road to Mt Tamborine. At the time, Ms Swinkles had
driven the vehicle for less
than 700 kilometres since she had purchased it. She immediately notified
L&W Motors, who arranged
to pick up the car from her home the next day. The
mechanics who inspected it (Mr Antaw, and an assistant of his) could not find
anything wrong with the vehicle. It was returned to Ms Swinkles.
14 April 2006, Ms Swinkles says that the knocking noise was still present,
particularly when travelling on rough roads, so she
returned the vehicle again
to L&W Motors. On that occasion, she says, Mr Antaw tested the vehicle on a
rougher road and admitted
that he heard the knocking noise. She left the
vehicle with him. Mr Antaw again could find nothing wrong mechanically and he
that the knocking noise may have been caused by a loose inner
left-hand bumper bar plastic shroud, which he repaired. Ms Swinkles
in making that repair, he caused damage to the front bumper bar. When she
pointed that out to Mr Antaw, they had an argument
and she left the
Swinkles stated that, on 24 April 2006, the knocking noise was very bad and she
took it to Bridgestone, where she was told that
the front and back shock
absorbers were faulty, the car was not roadworthy and she should obtain a fresh
roadworthy certificate.
She obtained that certificate on 8 May 2006, at which
stage the odometer read 182,691. That identified that the strut tower bearing
mounts were cracked and all engine mounts were broken. That certificate was
completed, and the inspection carried out, by Mr Owen
Thomas, an approved
examiner. Ms Swinkles paid Mr Thomas $54.60 for the cost of obtaining the
roadworthy certificate.
suspension and engine mounts were repaired at a total cost of $1,764.00.
Swinkles gave evidence that on 1 June 2006 the steering failed, the knocking
noise was still present and, upon inspection, it was
found that driving links
were so worn out that it was only a matter of time before the steering broke
when driving. Steering arms
and stabilisers were installed at a cost of
18 July 2006, the gearing box stopped working properly. Ms Swinkles took it for
inspection and repair and it was necessary to
expend further funds having that
fixed. That cost $1,190.00.
against L&W Motors. In that action, she sought recovery of $1,892.60 for
mechanical repairs and, $555.00 for repair to
the damaged front bumper bar and
costs. The action was for breach of contract arising out of the statutory
Swinkles subsequently discontinued that action because she could no longer
afford to pay solicitors to represent her and she was
advised to commence a
claim in the Small Claims Tribunal. She did so, again relying upon the
statutory warranty. By that stage,
her claim amounted to $4,466.00, comprising
all the costs referred to above.
Swinkles’ claim in the Small Claims Tribunal was heard on 9 October 2006,
when the following order was made:
“The Tribunal ordered that the entity who started the
proceedings is to start the proceedings before the Commercial and Consumer
Tribunal under section 31.”
is a puzzling order, because
Small Claims Tribunals Act
provides simply that a Tribunal may from time to time adjourn a proceeding
to such times and places and for such purposes as it considers
necessary. It
appears, however, that the person hearing the claim before that Tribunal must
have formed the view that Ms Swinkles
may have a claim that could only be heard
by this Tribunal and adjourned the proceeding in the Small Claims Tribunal to
outcome of a claim being made by Ms Swinkles in this Tribunal.
Issues in this Tribunal
her claim against the claim fund lodged with the Chief Executive, Ms Swinkles
appears to have been asserting that the provision
to her of the roadworthy
certificate issued by Mr Antaw was a misrepresentation, contrary to section 574
of the Act, as to the condition
of the vehicle. For the purpose of the claim
against the fund, in a statement given to the investigator she said that she
asking the salesperson, Mr Garnham, if the vehicle had ever been in a
car accident and he replied
“No, I have known the previous owner for 20
years and the car is fine, it has never been in a smash.”
was not until her statement to this Tribunal that Ms Swinkles said that Mr
Garnham told her that the vehicle had belonged to a
friend of his for 20 years
and he had jumped at the chance because his friend always looked after his
Owens called Mr Thomas, who had conducted the second inspection and discovered
the broken engine mounts and cracked struts. She
asked him how long the engine
mounts had been broken. He said it was difficult to ascertain. They did not
look fresh and it looked
like they had been there for some time and he would not
have thought that the breaks had happened in the previous 1,500 kilometres
cross-examination, Mr Thomas agreed that it was not unusual to have to replace
engine mounts in a vehicle that had done over 183,000
kilometres and such
cracking would be normal wear and tear. He was asked whether, if the mounts
were on the verge of cracking, they
could be cracked by being driven on a
corrugated road. He said that it would be unusual for cracking to be caused by
a corrugated
road but, if they were at the point where they were starting to
split and the car was driven over a corrugated road, the engine mounts
crack. Otherwise it was unlikely.
said that the cracks to the strut tower would not have been difficult to see and
it would be unlikely that they would have occurred
within the previous 1,500
kilometres.
former owner of the vehicle was called to give evidence. He said that he sold
it to a car wholesaler in Lau Place, off Hind Street.
He said he had not had
any trouble with it.
Garnham was also called to give evidence and he said that he bought the vehicle
from a car wholesaler at premises just off Hind
Street. It appears, therefore,
that Mr Garnham and the former owner of the vehicle had never had any contact
with each other at
Swinkles did not cross-examine Mr Garnham and did not put to him the
representations that she alleges he made. However, I do not
hold that against
Ms Swinkles, as she is not a lawyer and this is the third court or tribunal in
which she has had to commence proceedings
in a very long saga. It could be
expected that Mr Garnham would have denied making those representations, so
putting them to him
would not have served any real purpose in this case.
Determination of the issues
am not satisfied that simply giving Ms Swinkles the roadworthy certificate was a
representation by Mr Garnham that the vehicle was
in satisfactory condition.
Nor am I satisfied that, at the time that the first roadworthy certificate was
obtained, it was falsely
completed. I am satisfied that the cracking in the
engine mounts and struts were not obvious to the person who undertook that
certificate, although it clearly became obvious shortly
thereafter.
Swinkles strikes me as a person who is trying her best to honestly give her
account of the conversation that occurred over 3 years
ago. However, that
account has changed considerably over the years. Ms Swinkles has had a very
frustrating (not to say expensive)
experience with this car and, in my view, her
recollection has been tainted by that experience. It would be extremely
annoying and
frustrating, and it has clearly been upsetting to Ms Swinkles, for
a car purchased only a short time before to need such major repairs
to it. However, that is the purpose of obtaining a warranty, both statutory and
all the circumstances, I do not need to determine whether I am satisfied that Mr
Garnham made the representations alleged by Ms
Swinkles. This is because, even
if he had made those representations, that does not mean that Ms Swinkles’
loss was caused
by them. Regardless of whether the car had been looked after
during its earlier lifetime, in any vehicle of its age, and which had
driven a long distance, it would not be unusual for these types of problems to
occur. So, although any representations made
to her may have caused her to
purchase the car, I do not consider that they would have been misleading or
false in the relevant sense.
It is unfortunate that the problems arose, but
they are problems likely to be covered by a warranty if they occurred within a
warranty period.
the problem with the engine mounts and the struts became manifest during the
term of the statutory warranty (which is not something
that I have to decide),
then Ms Swinkles’ claim is properly brought in a Small Claims Tribunal and
not in this Tribunal: section
324 of the Act gives a Small Claims Tribunal the
is covered by the statutory warranty. If the defect only became apparent
outside the period of one month (or 1000km) from the date
of purchase, then it
may well have been covered by the extended warranty, but it appears that no
claim in respect of the engine mounts
and struts was made under that warranty
and the claim in respect of the gearbox was rejected because the
warrantor’s mechanic
was not given an opportunity to inspect the vehicle
before it was repaired.
these circumstances, if Ms Swinkles has a claim, it is a claim that should be
pursued in a Small Claims Tribunal pursuant to section
324 of the Act.
Accordingly,
I propose to dismiss this application.
