Neie v Inns (by Ray White Northgate) [2013] SARTT 6989 (17 February 2014)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON
Hearing 17 February 2014 at Adelaide
NEIE v INNS (By Ray White Northgate)
(RT13/6989)
The tenancy was for a fixed term. The question was whether the term in the
tenancy agreement which purported to permit the rent to
be reviewed, was
sufficient for the purposes of Section 55 of the Act. The relevant clause
The rent will be reviewed from time to time in accordance with the
Act and in the event the Landlord wishes to vary the rental payable
Landlord must give notice pursuant to Section 55 of the Act or as prescribed
from time to time.”
The RTT found that this clause was not sufficiently specific for the purposes
of Section 55 of the Act and so declined to permit the
rent increase.
This is the determination of the tenant's application lodged with the
Tribunal on 24 January 2014 seeking a determination that the
agreed rental for
the leased premises not be increased during the term of the tenancy.
erms of the Residential Tenancy Agreement:
Rental premises: 4 Flinders Drive Valley View SA
Landlord: Constance Inns
Landlord’s Agent: Ray White
Tenant: Monika Neie
Tenancy Commenced: 13 June 2011
of Tenancy: Twelve months extended to 10 June 2014
Rent: $280.00 per
week, payable fortnightly
Security Bond: $1680.00 was guaranteed by the
South Australian Housing Trust and registered with the Commissioner for
Consumer and Business Services (Bond No. 3749408-3).
I find there is a Residential Tenancy Agreement on the abovementioned terms
which is subject to the
Residential Tenancies Act, 1995
At the hearing of this matter the tenant, Monika Neie, gave sworn evidence as
did the landlord’s agents, Penny Belekas and Denise
Bateman from Ray White
Northgate. The proceedings were interpreted in the German and English languages
by Mr T. Kruckemeyer.
The agents stated that the landlord intended to increase the rent on the
premises from $280.00 per week to $300.00 per week as from
17 February 2014. A
notice pursuant to
was served on the tenant to this
effect. The landlord’s agents stated that the Residential Tenancy
Agreement signed by the
parties includes a clause which does authorise a rent
increase during the tenancy.
Clause 4 of the General Conditions of the tenancy agreement states: -
Rent Review
“The rent will be reviewed from time to time in accordance with the
and in the event the Landlord wishes to vary the rental payable then the
Landlord must give notice pursuant to
or as prescribed
from time to time”.
This clause provides for rent review in accordance with the
. The relevant
(1) The landlord may increase the rent payable under a
residential tenancy agreement by giving written notice to the tenant specifying
the date as from which the increase takes effect.
• A series of residential tenancy agreements between the same
parties and relating to the same premises is treated as a single
residential
tenancy agreement for the purposes of this section unless at least six months
have elapsed since rent for the premises
was fixed or last increased.
(2) However—
(a) the right to increase the rent may be excluded or limited by the
terms of the residential tenancy agreement; and
(b) if the tenancy is for a fixed term, the residential tenancy
agreement is taken to exclude an increase in rent during the term
specifically allows for an increase in rent; and
(c) the date fixed for an increase of rent must be at least six months
after the date of the agreement or, if there has been a previous
increase of
rent under this section, the last increase and at least 60 days after the notice
As the abovementioned tenancy agreement is for a fixed term and states that
the rent may be reviewed
in accordance
(my underlining) with the
a rent increase is excluded unless "specifically" allowed for in the tenancy
agreement. The wording of Clause 4 in the current
agreement refers the reader
, "excludes" a rent increase unless
"specifically" provided for in the agreement. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary
defines "specific"
as "precise or exact in respect of fulfilment, conditions or
terms; definite, explicit".
After reviewing the wording of the
and the tenancy agreement, I am of the
view that the tenancy agreement does not
"specifically"
provide for a
rent increase during the term of the tenancy agreement. Clause 4 of the General
Conditions provides that any rent review
must be in accordance with
but Clause 4 does not, of itself, "specifically" or "explicitly"
provide for a rent increase. It does no more than state that the
landlord must
comply with the
when purporting to increase the rent.
If a landlord does seek to retain the right to increase the rent during a
fixed term tenancy a clause to this effect can be specifically
included in the
agreement. The clause would need to specify the amount of the proposed increase
so that the tenant can make an informed
consent as to their liability for rent
and any rent increase when signing the agreement. The landlord can not seek to
agreement which gives them the right to increase the rent by whatever
amount they choose.
I accordingly find that the tenancy agreement does not specifically provide
for a rent increase during the fixed term and it is not
available to the
landlord to seek to increase the rent during the term of the tenancy. The Notice
served on the tenant pursuant to
is therefore ineffective
to increase the rent. There will be an order declaring that the rent will remain
at $280.00 per week for
the term of the current agreement.
Pursuant to
Section 35(5)
, the Tribunal declares that the rent
in relation to the abovementioned tenancy will remain at $280.00 per week until
the end of the
current fixed term.
