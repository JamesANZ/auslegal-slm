The landlord has submitted evidence that the back garden has
been damaged by the requested pet. Photos of the lawn from the commencement
the tenancy (February 2024) show that it is in good condition – the grass
appears green and healthy, with no dead patches.
Three routine
inspection reports have been submitted showing the destruction of the lawn in

A quote supplied by the landlord for rectification of the rear yard by

held for this premises, being $1,055.

last routine inspection
(December 2024) and scratching the black surface. No
photographs have been supplied to prove this damage was caused. A detailed quote
from [redacted], individualised the replacement costs for a variety of doors
within the premises. Doors range from $411.75 to $3,025

damage to the premises that would cost
more than the security bond to repair. I am therefore satisfied that this ground
for refusal

Considering the information from the landlord
and the tenant, I am satisfied that keeping the requested pet is likely to cause
