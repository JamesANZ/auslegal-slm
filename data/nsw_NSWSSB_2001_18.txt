REASONS FOR DECISION
A. On 24 October 2000 the respondents were given notice to comply with by-law 17
by removing sarlon shade cloth from the front of
the balcony of their lot.
B. On 4 January 2001 the applicant commenced proceedings for the imposition of a
pecuniary penalty upon the respondents under
section 203
Schemes Management Act 1996
for contravening the
C. On 13 February 2001 the Board found that the respondents had contravened
by-law 17 after being served with a notice to comply
with that by-law. However
in the circumstances of the case, the Board decided not order the respondents to
pay a pecuniary penalty.
D. The applicant has made a further application under
section 203
the imposition of a penalty for breach of the notice to comply served on 24
October 2000.
E. It is thus necessary to consider whether the notice to comply having been
given to the respondents on 24 October 2000, the applicant
is entitled to make
successive applications for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty within the
time stipulated in
section 203(2)
F. It has been established that a failure to comply with an adjudicator’s
order within the time stipulated can only be the
subject of one application to
the Board for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. See the
Strata Plan 34198
(SB00/61 Mr G Cochrane) and the
decision of Judge Nield in
Body Corporate Strata Plan 19125
(Liverpool District Court No. 2060 of 1995).
G. The effect of these decisions was that the order expired on the date for
compliance and the failure to comply by that date was
a contravention of that
order. However, it is a single contravention (i.e a failure to comply with an
order by a specified date)
even though the contravention may continue for a
considerable time. Hence, once penalised, the person in breach of the order
be punished again, even if the person has not complied with the order.
To do otherwise would offend the legal principle that a person
punished twice for the same transgression.
H. I am of the view that the same reasoning does not apply to contravention of a
by-law. Owners and occupiers are required to comply
with the by-laws at all
times. Thus failing to comply with a by-law on a separate and discrete occasion
or by way of a continuing
failure gives rise to multiple breaches of the by-law
and not a single breach.
I. This approach is consistent with the wording of
. A notice to comply, issued under
does not require a
date for compliance. The notice simply serves as a warning of the consequences
of not complying with an existing
obligation. Further,
section 203
clear that any failure to comply within 12 months of the giving of notice may
result in a pecuniary penalty. If it were
intended that only one such
application for a pecuniary penalty could be made in these circumstances, then
section 203
would state the penalty applies where the person has failed to
comply with the notice and not the by-law.
J. For all of these reasons I am satisfied that the owners corporation is
entitled to make this further application under
section 203
, being within the 12
month time allowed.
K. The evidence before the Tribunal is that the respondents are in breach of
by-law 17 at the date of hearing.
L. Having regard to the finding made on 13 February 2001 and the failure of the
respondent to remove the shadecloth since that determination,
inappropriate in the circumstances of the case to impose a pecuniary penalty
section 203
M. The applicant seeks costs and is entitled to the hourly rate set out in the
Strata Managing Agent’s Agreement for the time
involved in attending the
