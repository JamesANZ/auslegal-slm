Complainants AN v Statutory Authority
[2009] VPrivCmr 3
IPP 2 – Use and Disclosure
Allegation the Statutory Authority disclosed personal information to a
neighbour, for a related secondary purpose, which would
not reasonably be
expected (IPP 2.1(a)).
IPP 4 – Data Security
– Allegation that by disclosing
personal information to a neighbour, the Statutory Authority failed to take
reasonable steps
to protect personal information from misuse, loss and
unauthorised disclosure (IPP 4.1).
_____________________________________________________________________
The Complainants (a couple) made a complaint to the
Statutory Authority about a neighbour, an officer of the Statutory Authority.
The complaint concerned the officer’s failure to personally abide by
certain statutory regulations. The officer was in fact
responsible, as part of
his role at the Statutory Authority, to ensure that other individuals in the
community were complying with
those same regulations.
The Statutory Authority conducted an internal investigation into the
complaint, requesting that the Complainants provide written statements.
Statutory Authority subsequently dismissed the employee. In the process of
dismissal, the Statutory Authority disclosed witness
statements provided by the
Complainants, which contained their personal information, including their names,
addresses and private
telephone numbers.
The Complainants soon began to receive abusive and threatening phone calls
from the dismissed employee. Complaints to the Statutory

2.1(a)), and

protect their personal information from unauthorised access and misuse

personal information was not a disclosure of information
for a secondary purpose
related to the primary purpose (of investigating the complaint), as required
under IPP 2.1. The failure of
the Statutory Authority to take reasonable steps
to protect the Complainants’ personal information from misuse by the
employee also raised issues under IPP 4.
The Commissioner decided there were no grounds on which to decline the
complaint under s.29 of the
Information Privacy Act
, and referred the
complaint to conciliation.
During conciliation, the Statutory Authority acknowledged the inappropriate
disclosure of the Complainants’ personal information,
and issued an

amended its privacy policies and procedures, and issued
a memorandum to remind
all staff of the consequences of the breach of privacy policies.
The complaint was resolved following an offer of financial compensation,
including an agreement that the Statutory Authority pay costs
associated with
potential relocation of the Complainants. The Statutory Authority also agreed to
