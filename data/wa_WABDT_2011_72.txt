CASES REFERRED TO
THE DECISION
Not applicable
REASONS FOR DECISION AND ORDER
1. BACKGROUND
For the preceding decision see the Reasons for
Decision issued on 11 August 2011. Following on the hearing it was agreed that
Complainants would submit a claim for costs of witnesses called at the
hearing. Those claims were submitted by letters of Counsel
for the Complainants
on 12 August 2011 and the Respondents on 18 August 2011.
2. BASIS OF CONSIDERATION
Section 38(3)
Builders Registration Act 1939
“(3) Subject to subsection (4), the Disputes Tribunal may make
such order for costs as it thinks fit”
. Subsection (4) relates to
legal costs and is not applicable here where we are dealing with the costs of
the Complainants to bring
on the case for hearing.
2.2 The problem with this matter is that the Respondent early on had accepted
liability and the case should have related only to
the extent of remedying the
faults in the doors and windows to prevent further increase in the penetration
of water into the building.
As noted in the first case the Respondent as Builder
had not appealed an Order to Remedy No. 50/2008-09. Therefore the evidence
by the Tribunal related solely to the cause of the leaks and the costs
of remedying those failures in the structure. In this respect
a large part of
the evidence was repetitive or was more relevant to liability rather than the
technical evidence needed to determine
the cost of eliminating the ingress of
water. Accordingly we have not accepted all the claims for evidence, or for
numerous reports
where only one was necessary.
3. ASSESSMENT OF CLAIMS
3.1 There were six claims on behalf of
Housespect:
19 October 2009, a report by Mr MJ Francheschi at an early period was not
relevant to the hearing nor was Mr Francheschi called
to give evidence, and this
account is therefore dismissed.
4 November 2009, a report by Mr A Booth as to the causes was relevant and Mr
Booth was called as a witness in this respect.
The amount of $725 is therefore
5 January 2010, a further report by Mr Booth added nothing to his previous
report of only two months earlier. A number of matters
referred to in this
report, such as the absence of a waterproof membrane on the balcony, were found
to be incorrect. The report added
nothing to the evidence and is therefore
disallowed.
4 March 2010, this related to attendance by Mr Booth at an inspection by the
Builders Registration Board Inspector. There was
really no need for the
Inspector to have any assistance nor did Mr Booth make any report but as the
Builder conceded half of the
cost this will be allowed at $337.50.
28 June 2010, this report was given by Mr Tranter and related to a quotation for
supervising services once the payments ordered
by the Tribunal were utilised to
get the work done. Why a report was required is not stated. The evidence could
have been given by
Mr Booth and the claim is disallowed.
19 July 2011, this invoice for 6.5 hours (approx.) at $250 an hour for Mr
Booth’s attendance at the hearing, Mr Booth
was called with Mr Gronow
Builders Registration Board Inspector. Since Mr
Booth was only giving evidence as to his inspections and especially on the first
this was often related more to liability then what to do to solve the
problems. We consider the charge of $250 per hour, while it
may be appropriate
to actual work in the field, was inappropriate for giving evidence. We consider
the charges which were far in
excess of other witness are more appropriate at
$125 an hour and the amount allowed is therefore
3.2 Federation Tuck Pointing – Mr Grahame as the witness had two invoices.
The first related to his appearance at the hearing
as a witness when he gave
evidence for half an hour but the charge related also to waiting time. An hour
and a half of waiting time
was excessive and we allow a total of one hour or
$85. As to the second invoice this related to his investigation of the position
during which he made a hole in the south wall which he acknowledged was his
responsibility to repair. His evidence included the north
window for which he
was not sure of the solution and also quoting for weep-holes around the house.
Again we would allow for half
his account as being relevant to the issues before
us. This comes to $660.
3.3 UTS Soltec Pty Ltd – This merely reported on the wind classification
for the area, a matter which was never disputed. The
account is therefore
disallowed.
3.4 Structerre – No one was called to give evidence on this matter. It was
merely a report confirming that repairs done by
the Builder to a crack had been
effective. The account is therefore disallowed.
3.5 All Surface Restorations – The evidence here was given by Mr Wellstead
and the invoices related to his examination of the
premises and to his evidence
before the Tribunal. The evidence was helpful and the rate at $136 an hour
reasonable. Accordingly the
bills are allowed a total of
3.6 City of Wanneroo – Site Plan. This was not relevant to our enquiries
and is disallowed.
3.7 Toodyay Building and Maintenance – Mr Haynes was called but his
evidence added nothing to the assessment of the problems.
He was a glass cutter
and glazier and appeared to stray outside the ambit of his experience and some
of his evidence had inaccurate
conclusions. Accordingly the claim is
disallowed.
3.8 Zedcon Scientific Services – This was a report on the lintels, a
matter which was withdrawn as a complaint. No evidence
was given on the matter
and accordingly the claim is disallowed.
3.9 Shelley Glass – Mr Ripamonti gave evidence in this matter and his
evidence was useful and of help to the Tribunal. Accordingly
his claim at $220
is allowed.
4. TOTALS ALLOWED
The amounts allowed are:
Federation Tuck Pointing
All Surface Restorations
Shelley Glass
Accordingly there will be an Order that:
“In accordance with Section 38.3 of the
Builders Registration Act
Builder is to pay the Owner for costs of witnesses the amount of $4,073.75
within 21 days of the date of this Order.”
