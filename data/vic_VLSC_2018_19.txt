Commissioner’s office ); and

STATEMENT OF REASONS
or about April 2015, the Respondent Lawyer was engaged by the Complainant in
relation to her separation from [Name] (‘the
the course of the engagement, the Respondent Lawyer prepared consent orders
which were executed by the parties. Relevantly,
clause 6 of the consent orders
provided for a superannuation split in respect of the husband’s
superannuation interest in the
UniSuper Superannuation Scheme
(‘UniSuper’).
letter dated 1 July 2015, the Respondent Lawyer wrote to UniSuper affording
procedural fairness by enclosing a copy of the consent
orders for approval. The
Respondent Lawyer did not receive a response to that letter.
7 July 2015, the Respondent Lawyer filed an Application for Consent Orders with
the Dandenong Family Court.
14 August 2015, the consent orders were approved by the Court and orders
(‘defective Orders’) were made. The defective
Orders, however, were
missing a page and did not reflect the consent orders signed by the parties.
This issue went unnoticed by the
Respondent Lawyer at the time.
letter dated 18 September 2015, the Respondent Lawyer provided UniSuper with a
certified copy of the defective orders and requested
the Trustee effect the
superannuation split.
letter to the Respondent Lawyer dated 25 September 2015, UniSuper noted that the
Trustee had not been afforded procedural fairness
and that the defective orders
appeared to be missing pages.
or about 27 October 2015, the Respondent Lawyer attended the Court to inspect
the file to determine whether or not there was a
page missing as UniSuper had
suggested. The orders contained on the file were also missing pages. When the
Respondent Lawyer asked
the Registrar how this could be remedied, she claims to
have been informed that the defective orders stand and that the super fund
be required to comply with the superannuation split.
letter dated 10 December 2015, the Respondent Lawyer wrote to UniSuper advising
them of the matters set out at paragraph 8 above,
and requesting the Trustee
effect the superannuation split.
letter to the Respondent Lawyer dated 21 December 2015, UniSuper:
noted it did not
receive the letter dated 1 July 2015;
advised that the
defective orders were not acceptable to the Trustee (and outlined the reasons
requested the
Respondent Lawyer amend the proposed orders and provide them to the Trustee for

office raising concerns about the Respondent Lawyer’s
the defective orders; and

Issues under investigation
issues under investigation were whether the Respondent Lawyer:
to remedy the defective orders in a competent and timely manner;
to communicate with the Complainant; and
to communicate with the Commissioner’s office and respond to statutory
requests for information.
Investigation
letters dated 18 April 2016, the Commissioner’s office gave notice to the
parties of its decision to investigate the complaint
and requested a response
from the Respondent Lawyer. By letter dated 9 May 2016, the Respondent Lawyer
provided her response. In
that response the Respondent Lawyer:
that the first time she became aware that the superannuation split had not been
effected was when she received correspondence
from the Commissioner’s
office in relation to the complaint;
acknowledged
that the consent orders, as approved by the Court, were incomplete and did not
reflect the orders signed by the parties;
as the lawyer handling the matter, she had not taken sufficient action to
finalise the matter for the Complainant or to
ensure third parties had taken
steps to complete the matter; and
to undertake all and any work required to remedy and finalise the
email dated 12 May 2016, the Commissioner’s office provided the
Complainant with a copy of the Respondent Lawyer’s
response, and sought
confirmation as to how she wished to proceed. By return email that same day, the
Complainant confirmed she would
like the Respondent Lawyer to remedy and
finalise the matter.
9 May 2016 and 12 February 2018, various correspondence and communications were
exchanged between the Respondent Lawyer, the
Complainant, the husband, UniSuper
and the Court in relation to remedying the defective orders.
between 13 May 2016 and 6 March 2018, various correspondence and communications
were exchanged between the Respondent Lawyer
and the Commissioner’s office
in which the Commissioner’s office sought information and documentation in
relation to
the progress of the Complainant’s legal matter. Relevantly, by
letters dated 27 September 2016, 24 October 2016, 10 January
2017, 13 February
2017, and 20 April 2017, the Commissioner’s office made statutory requests
of the Respondent Lawyer (pursuant
to Section 371 of the Uniform Law) for
documentation and information.
the course of the investigation, representatives of the Commissioner’s
office also reviewed the Respondent Lawyer’s
original client file and met
with the Respondent Lawyer on 18 July 2017.
letters dated 6 March 2018, the Commissioner’s office wrote to the
Respondent Lawyer setting out what the investigation indicated
to date and
inviting any further written submissions and material from the Respondent Lawyer
before a decision was made. By letter
dated 3 April 2018, the Respondent Lawyer
provided her response. In that response the Respondent Lawyer:
provided an explanation for her inability to progress the Complainant’s
legal matter for a period of time;
that she has not previously had the need to amend any orders and had not,
therefore, had an occasion to use the ‘slip
advised that, as a result of this matter, she has:
courses in relation to time management and communication skills;
employed an
administrative support person to assist her with her
acknowledged
that there had been times when her responses to the Commissioner’s office
were not timely, noting that her workload,
lack of administrative support, and
inability to say ‘no’ to work may have contributed to this;
that she had to contend with personal issues which regrettably lead to some
her remorse at allowing her personal feelings affect her judgment;
that the appropriate penalty should be either:
and additional CPD; or
18 May 2018, a representative of the Commissioner’s office phoned the
Respondent Lawyer to discuss the proposed determination.
By email dated 21 May
2018, the Respondent Lawyer confirmed her offer to pay the Complainant $2,500
within 45 days of the determination.
letters dated 28 May 2018, the Commissioner’s office wrote to the parties
giving notice of our proposed determination and
seeking any written submissions
or material in relation to the proposed orders before the determination is made.
No further submissions
or material have been received by either the Respondent
Lawyer or the Complainant.
Relevant law
complaint is concerned with conduct that occurred in or about August 2015 and in
or about February 2018. At the time that the
conduct occurred, the Uniform Law
Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct
Rules 2015 (Victoria)
(‘Uniform Rules’) were in force.
4 of the Uniform Rules prescribes that a solicitor must:
in the best interests of a client in any matter in which the solicitor
represents the client.
deliver legal services competently, diligently and as promptly as reasonably
371 of the Uniform Law provides:
(1) For the purposes of carrying
out a complaint investigation in relation to a lawyer or law practice, an
investigator may, by notice

associate of the law practice (as the case requires), require the lawyer or
to do any one or more of the following-
provide, at or before a specified time and at a specified place, any specified
document (or a copy of the document);
provide written information on or before a specified date (verified by statutory
declaration if the requirement states); to otherwise
assist in, or cooperate
with, the investigation of the complaint in a specified

Case handling
the basis of the evidence before me, including an extensive review of the
original client file and the materials and submissions
provided by the
Respondent Lawyer and the Complainant, I find that the Respondent Lawyer failed
to remedy the defective orders in
a competent and timely manner. On this point I
note that some two and a half years have passed since the defective orders were
it appears that some of the delay is attributable to:
difficulties in contacting the husband to have him sign the amended orders
(between June and October 2016);
the processing of the amended orders by the Court; and
changes in the
requirements of UniSuper,
I find that much of the delay is
attributable to:
understanding on the Respondent Lawyer’s part as to the steps required to
amend the defective Orders; and
a failure on the
Respondent Lawyer’s part to progress the matter in a timely
the meeting at the Commissioner’s office on 18 July 2017, the Respondent
acknowledged
that she had handled the file poorly;
that she had let her personal feelings impact on her handling of the
her lack of knowledge of the ‘slip rule’; and
the suggestion that she seek assistance from a barrister or solicitor to help
progress and finalise the matter.
while I am pleased that the Respondent Lawyer sought the assistance of a
barrister and solicitor to progress and finalise the
matter, had she sought
their assistance at the outset and/or earlier it may have greatly reduced the
length of time that it took
to finalise the matter.
light of the above, and on the material currently before me, I find that the
Respondent Lawyer has breached Rules 4.1.1 and 4.1.3
of the Uniform
Communication with the Complainant
the basis of the evidence before me, including an extensive review the materials
and submissions provided by the Respondent Lawyer
and the Complainant, I find
that the Respondent Lawyer had no communication with the Complainant between the
periods of:
2015 and May 2016, despite the ongoing issue with the defective orders;
January 2017 and 1 June 2017
despite the concerns raised by the Commissioner’s office about the
Respondent Lawyer’s failure to keep the Complainant
this point I note that, at the meeting at the Commissioner’s office on 18
July 2017, the Respondent Lawyer disclosed:
it had been
some months since she had spoken with the Complainant; and
she had let her
personal feelings affect her handling of the matter.
light of the above, and on the material currently before me, I find that the
Respondent Lawyer has breached Rules 4.1.1 and 4.1.3
of the Uniform
Communication with the Commissioner’s
the basis of the evidence before me, including an extensive review the materials
and submissions provided by the Respondent Lawyer
and the Complainant, I find
that the Respondent Lawyer failed to respond (in the specified time and/or at
messages left by the Commissioner’s office on 6 April 2016, 8 April 2016,
7 September 2016, 3 March 2017, 21 March

March 2017, 24 July 2017, 27 July 2017, and 11
October 2017;
requests for information dated 27 September 2016, 10 January 2017, 13 February
2017, and 20 April 2017.
light of the above, and on the material currently before me, I find that the
Respondent Lawyer has breached Section 371 of the
Uniform Law.
I find that the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct has fallen short of the
standard of competence and diligence that a member
of the public is entitled to
expect of a reasonably competent lawyer.
Characterisation of
298 of the Uniform Law prescribes that, without limitation, conduct capable of
constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct
or professional misconduct
consisting of a contravention of the Uniform Law; and
consisting of a contravention of the Uniform Rules.
reason of the above findings, I find that the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct
is properly characterised as unsatisfactory professional
conduct (within the
meaning of section 296 of the Uniform Law) because it occurred in the connection
with legal practice and falls
short of the standard of competence and diligence
that a member of the public is entitled to expect of a reasonably competent
do not find that the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct is properly characterised
as professional misconduct (within section 297
of the Uniform Law) because the
conduct does not amount to a substantial or consistent failure to reach or
maintain a reasonable
standard of competence and diligence, nor does it justify
a finding that the Respondent Lawyer is not a fit and proper person to
legal practice.
Determination & reasons
this matter, as mitigating factors, I have taken into account:
work undertaken by the Respondent Lawyer (at her own cost) to remedy the
defective Orders;
concessions made by the Respondent Lawyer during the course of the investigation
in relation to her handling of the Complainant’s
legal matter and her
communications with the Complainant and the Commissioner’s
offer of the Respondent Lawyer to pay the Complainant the sum of $2,500 within
45 days of the date of the determination; and
Respondent Lawyer has no history of prior disciplinary findings.
considered all of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I determine
that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the orders detailed
to section 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to the VCAT, or seek a review by the VCAT, of this
determination made under
section 299 of the Uniform
failure to comply with a determination made under section 299 is capable of
constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or
professional misconduct
