for the respondent
J: The applicant applies for leave to appeal against three sentences. The
applicant pleaded guilty to counts 2 and 3 on
indictment 185 of 2002 presented
at Maroochydore District Court on 3 June 2002. Count 2 was breaking and
entering premises and stealing.
Count 3 was wilful damage. These offences were
committed on 18 February 2002.
On count 2,
the applicant was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. On count 3,
the applicant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.
It was recommended that
the applicant be eligible for post-prison community based release after serving
Count 1 on that indictment was also a charge of breaking and entering premises
and stealing, but in respect of events which occurred
on 27 May 2000. The
applicant pleaded guilty to that offence of 15 July 2002 and was sentenced to
12 months imprisonment which was
to be served concurrently with the sentences
imposed on 3 June 2002.
There was confusion at the sentence hearing on 3 June 2002 about what suspended
sentences needed to be dealt with. The applicant
had been in custody between
18 February 2002 and
3 June 2002 in respect of counts 2 and 3 and a summary offence of contravene
direction on 18 February 2002 which arose out of the
police investigation of
the offences which are counts 2 and 3.
That summary offence was dealt with in the Magistrates Court on 24 July 2002
for which the applicant was fined $300, in default
six days imprisonment to be
served concurrently with the existing sentences.
It is common ground that a declaration under section 161 of the
Penalties and
Sentences Act 1992
should have been made when the applicant was sentenced on 3
June 2002 in respect of the period of 105 days between 18 February and
The applicant also submits that the sentence of two and a half years
imprisonment for count 2 exceeded the range submitted by the
Prosecutor of 18
months to two years and that the sentence in respect of count 2 should be
varied to conform with that range. That
sentence was imposed, however, with
the applicant being given the benefit of the recommendation of post-prison
community based release
after 12 months.
At the time of sentencing on 3 June 2002 the applicant had a significant prior
criminal history and had committed the offence on
18 February 2002 during the
operational period of suspended sentences imposed on 14 June 2002.
The sentence of two and a half years coupled with the post- prison community
based release recommendation was not manifestly excessive.
I would therefore grant the application for leave to appeal in respect of the
sentences imposed on 3 June 2002 for counts 2 and
3 and otherwise refuse the
application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on 15 July
In respect of the sentences in respect of which I would grant leave to appeal I
would allow the appeal in respect of those sentences
and vary the sentences by
the addition of the following declaration:
"Pursuant to section 161 of the
Penalties and Sentences Act 1992
declared that 105 days spent in pre-sentence custody between 18 February 2002
and 3 June 2002 be deemed time already served
under the sentences."
THE CHIEF JUSTICE: I agree.
McPHERSON JA: I also agree.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE: Those are the orders.
