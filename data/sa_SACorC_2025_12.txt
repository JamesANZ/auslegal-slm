external post-mortem examination was conducted by forensic pathologist, Dr John
Gilbert, at Forensic Science South Australia.
Toxicological analysis of
Mr Johnstone’s blood revealed a high, potentially lethal or toxic,
level of methylamphetamine (approximately
1.6 mg/L), and the metabolite
amphetamine. Also detected were morphine, monoacetylmorphine and codeine in
keeping with recent heroin
use. Dr Gilbert concluded that
Mr Johnstone died as a result of methylamphetamine and heroin
and I so find.
Reason for inquest
Mr Johnstone
was on home detention bail at the time of his death. His death therefore
amounted to a death in custody, and an inquest
into his death was mandatory in
accordance with
Coroners Act 2003
and medical history

when he was approximately 8 years of age
and Mr Johnstone then resided with

occasion, being 17 May 2021.

the morning of 4 September 2022, DCS Intensive Compliance Unit Monitoring Centre
received various alerts in relation to a critically
low battery in

officer Scott Jones was tasked to conduct
a welfare check on
Mr Johnstone.

had locked himself inside his

Conclusion and recommendations
find that Mr Johnstone administered methylamphetamine and heroin to himself
on 3 September 2022 causing his death. I am unable
to conclude whether
this was an accidental or deliberate overdose. Though the text messages sent to
Ms Pondi could be construed
as an expression of intent to end his life, they
also contain words that could be construed to the contrary, and the evidence
his grandmother who spoke to him not long before these text messages were
sent does not suggest he was suicidal at that time.
am satisfied that no third party was present at the time Mr Johnstone
administered these drugs to himself.
further find that Mr Johnstone was lawfully detained at the time his cause
of death arose.
