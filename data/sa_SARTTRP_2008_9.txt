At the Hearing of this matter the manager of Sturt River Caravan Park,
Sigfred Dannell, appeared and gave sworn evidence as did both
residents Benjamin Gravett and Jessica White.
Evidence was given that the residents had in fact vacated the premises on the
13 August and had given the keys back to the park management.
agreed that this had taken place but was concerned because there was still some
furniture and personal belongings left
in the caravan. I note that the parties
have agreed that the residents are to return to the park with the permission of
to take their possessions from the caravan and he has undertaken to
give them the key to enable them to do this. Miss White also
said that she will
clean the caravan and all this is to be done by no later than 5pm on Sunday 24
August 2008. Miss White said that
it is most likely that it will be done before
this period.
I note that the residents vacated the premises on the 13 August and the rent
is paid to the 16 August but the residents agreed that
the park management can
retain the 3 days rent overpaid as compensation for them not clearing their
goods from the caravan.
Mr Dannell indicated that the management would accept this in full settlement
of any possible compensation claim that he should have
against the residents.
Unless the Park management have any further losses not foreseeable at the time
of this hearing then the bond
should be returned to the residents.
I have to make a formal order to deal with the application and noting that
the above matters have been agreed to I am simply going
to dismiss the
Application.
Application dismissed.
