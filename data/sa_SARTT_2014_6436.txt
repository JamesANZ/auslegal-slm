McRostie v McIntyre [2014] SARTT 6436 (11 December 2014)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 11 DECEMBER
MCROSTIE V MCINTYRE (RT14/6436)
Whether or not a residential tenancy exists. Right of occupant to continue to
reside in the property.
This is the determination of an application lodged on 10 December 2014 by the
tenant seeking to vary or set aside an order of the
Tribunal made on 5 December
In the circumstances of this matter, the Tribunal has decided to determine
the application on the basis of the papers and without
conducting a hearing.
I refer to the order of the Tribunal made on 5 December 2014. That order
required the tenants to vacate the property on 17 December
2014 and required the
tenant to make a payment to the landlord.
Section 32(1)
Residential Tenancies Act 1995
(the Act) enables the
Tribunal to vary or set aside a previous order of the Tribunal if it considers
there are "proper grounds for
McNickle v White & White (no.2)

Tilmouth said that “proper grounds” should not be limited to
exceptional circumstances, and this approach was confirmed
Judge Beazley in
Rice & Dawson v Szlegel
[2009] SADC 27
where His Honour noted...
"It is self-evident that 'proper grounds' for a variation of orders may
arise in a wide variety of circumstances".
Consideration of the application
In the application the tenant stated that the decision was incorrect as
there was never any agreement that I was renting the
.”. He stated that the landlord denied that he had paid the
rates and failed to remember him paying cash in March 2012.
The tenant provided a copy of an agreement with his application by which he
apparently purported to purchase the property from the
landlord for
approximately $181,000.00. The document which is supposed to constitute the
agreement to buy and sell the property is
handwritten and is not signed or
There is a further handwritten document apparently signed by the landlord
(but undated) which states:-
“ 3 payments behind including the one due tomorrow –
$840 – loan
$215.29 – water bill I paid
$121.48 from last time I fixed it up
Plus council rates probably due”
There is a third handwritten document which appears to be a record of
payments and amounts outstanding. It is not signed by either
I note the following comments made by the Tribunal in the order of 5 December
At the hearing it was agreed by the parties that the tenant
initially moved into the premises with the landlord’s daughter but
following a separation, the daughter moved out some time in February 2012 and
the tenant agreed to rent the premises for $280.00
per week. It was also agreed
by the parties that the rent was paid to 9 September 2014....
While I do not have written evidence before me to this effect, I am
satisfied that the tenancy agreement commenced by 28 February
2012 and that rent
is paid to 9 September 2014.”...
..I find that making a vacant possession order in the circumstances is
appropriate particularly considering the amount of arrears
and that the tenant
has not made any payment at all for some 3 months.”
Conclusion and determination
It may well be that there was a verbal agreement between the landlord and the
tenant by which the tenant agreed to buy the property
from the landlord.
However, it is clear that the tenant has not bought the property from the
landlord. Further, there appears to
be no formal agreement for the sale.
Although there is a handwritten document, it is vague and it is unsigned and
undated. It is
extremely unlikely it would be enforced in a court.
What is clear is that the tenant has been living in the property initially
with the landlord’s daughter but subsequently he
remained in the property
after she vacated in February 2012. During this time the tenant has made some
payments to the landlord.
The tenant says those payments were made towards the
purchase of the property. As I have stated, there is no formal agreement between
the parties for the sale and purchase of the property and no such transaction
has been concluded.
Therefore at the hearing of the Tribunal on 5 December 2014 the Tribunal
concluded that as the payments were made in consideration
of the tenant being
able to reside in the property, there was a residential tenancy. The Tribunal
also concluded that the agreement
was for the tenant to pay rent at the rate of
$280.00 per week.
It is not necessary for there to be a written agreement for a residential
On 5 December 2014 the Tribunal found that Mr McRostie had been living in the
property and making payments to Mr McIntyre. The Tribunal
concluded that from
arrangement between the parties constituted
a residential tenancy and due to the
extent of the arrears, the Tribunal made an order for possession of the
If Mr McRostie considers that he is not a tenant and there is no tenancy
agreement then he may appeal this decision in the District
Court. I consider
that in spite of the confusing circumstances and the lack of formal
documentation, the findings made by the Tribunal
at the hearing on 5 December
2014 are consistent with the evidence and the law. Therefore I do not consider
there is any reason for
there to be an order to vary or set aside that
I make one final concluding remark for the guidance of Mr McRostie and that
is this: if he is not a tenant and there is no binding
agreement for the sale
and purchase of the property, then he is merely a licensee of the owner. In that
case, once the owner decides
that he no longer wants Mr McRostie to remain at
the property he can ask him to leave. If Mr McRostie does not leave then he
a trespasser. That is a police matter. However, Mr McRostie would be
well advised to take his own legal advice in this respect.
For these reasons I do not consider that the application establishes a proper
ground to vary or set aside the order and I will dismiss
the application.
The application is dismissed.
