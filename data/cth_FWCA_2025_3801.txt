Application for approval of the Turosi Thomastown and United Workers Union
Enterprise Agreement 2025
An application has been made for approval of an enterprise agreement
known as the
Turosi Thomastown and United Workers Union Enterprise Agreement
(the Agreement). The application was made pursuant to s.185 of the
Fair Work Act 2009
(the Act). It has been made by Turosi Pty Ltd. The
Agreement is a single enterprise agreement.
The Employer has provided written undertakings. A copy of the
undertakings is attached in Annexure A. I am satisfied that the undertakings
will not cause financial detriment to any employee covered by the Agreement and
that the undertakings will not result in substantial
changes to the Agreement.
The undertakings are taken to be a term of the Agreement.
Subject to the undertakings referred to above, I am satisfied that
each of the requirements of ss.186, 187, 188, 193 and 193A as are
relevant to
this application for approval have been met. The Agreement does not cover all of
the employees of the employer, however,
taking into account the factors in
ss.186(3) and (3A) I am satisfied that the group of employees was fairly
I observe that clauses 3.4.6, 6.1 and 6.4 of the Agreement are likely
to be inconsistent with the National Employment Standards (NES).
However, noting
clause 1.9 of the Agreement, I am satisfied the more beneficial entitlements of
the NES will prevail where there
is an inconsistency between the Agreement and
The United Workers’ Union being a bargaining representative for
the Agreement, has given notice under s.183 of the Act that
it wants the
Agreement to cover it. In accordance with s.201(2) I note that the Agreement
covers the organisation.
The Agreement is approved and in accordance with s.54, will operate
from 19 November 2025. The nominal expiry date of the Agreement
is 31 January
