REMARKS ON ADJOURNMENT
Panel has before it an application for review dated 28 September 2012, lodged by
the applicant employer pursuant to
section 72M
Workers Rehabilitation
and Compensation Act 1986
(“the Act”). The application seeks a
review of a decision of the respondent WorkCover Corporation of South Australia
(“WorkCover”)
dated 15 August 2012, assessing the employer’s
premium for the financial year 2012-2013, on the basis of claims estimates the
employer seems to say were inflated by excessive costs incurred by the claims
agent through mismanagement of two workers’ claims.

Review Panel Determination 2012
South Australian Government Gazette
10 May 2012, p.1617).
Determination provides, on receipt of an application for review, for an initial
reconsideration of the disputed decision by WorkCover.
In this case, WorkCover
took the view that both of the contentious claims had been managed appropriately
and therefore confirmed
the assessment.
such a case, the Determination further provides that a conciliator will attempt
to resolve the matter consensually between the
applicant employer and WorkCover.
If the matter fails to resolve in this way (as has been the case), the
application comes before
the full Panel of four members for hearing and
determination.
matter was listed before me today for an initial directions hearing. There was
no appearance for or on behalf of the employer.
However, Mr Makai, representing
WorkCover, had received the following communication on the applicant’s
letterhead:
“12 June 2013
“Attention: Stephen Makai / Kim Pedler
“I am writing on behalf of Mr Keith Patterson, to advise that he will
unfortunately not be available to attend the WorkCover
Hearing held on Tues. 18
“He apologizes for any inconvenience caused..
“For any further contact please feel free to call him on [phone
“Kind Regards
“Administration”
respect, this leaves it unclear when or whether Mr Patterson (who is identified
on the face of the application as Chief Executive
Officer of the applicant) will
be available, or indeed, whether the applicant intends to pursue this matter at
all. The fact that
the applicant has gone to the trouble of communicating at
all, however, suggests the applicant may not have entirely lost interest
application.
of the Panel are an opportunity, not an obligation. The Panel is willing to hear
what the applicant has to say in support
of its application (and also what
WorkCover has to say in support of its position) and to determine the
application. If it is inconvenient
for an applicant to attend a hearing but it
wishes to make a written submission, the Panel is willing to proceed in that way
decide the application on the basis of the written submissions. (Before
doing so, it seeks a set of relevant documents from WorkCover,
a copy of which
the applicant would also receive for its comment, and to which the applicant is
free to add.)
ball is now squarely in the applicant’s court. If it wishes to pursue its
application, it will need to contact the registry
of the Panel and indicate
whether it would like another date for a directions hearing (at which the timing
of an eventual final hearing
would be discussed) or whether it would prefer to
make a written submission only. If its preference is for the latter, it should
wait for WorkCover’s book of documents before preparing the written
submission.
the applicant does not wish to pursue its application, it need do nothing. If
nothing is heard within a reasonable period, the
file will be
Further consideration of this application is adjourned to a date to be fixed on
request of the applicant. No further action will
be taken on this review unless
and until such a request is made.
nothing is heard from the applicant within a reasonable period, I direct that
the file be closed.
