Troy Clarke v Q-Comp No 3 [2009] QIC 28; 192 QGIG 45 (11 September 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 25 September, 2009, Vol. 192, No. 4, pages
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Workers' Compensation
and Rehabilitation Act 2003
s. 561(1) - appeal against decision of
industrial commission
Troy John Clarke AND Q-COMP (C/2008/4)(No.
PRESIDENT HALL
11 September 2009
REPORT ON DECISION (as edited)
In giving a Decision from the Bench on 2 September 2009, the President
"The Appellant, Troy John Clarke, has instituted an Appeal against a decision
of the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission given
on 24 December 2007,
dismissing his appeal against a decision of Q-COMP, which rejected his claim for
compensation.
It is the effect of s. 561 of the
Workers' Compensation and Rehabilitation
(the Act), that such appeals are to be heard and determined upon
the record unless the Court orders additional evidence be heard.
On 29 April 2008, an application was made by Mr Clarke to lead 'additional
evidence'. That application was rejected. Mr Clarke now
makes a further
application to lead additional evidence.
To the extent that the additional evidence is the same evidence that was
rejected by this Court on 13 June 2008, I reject the new
application and confirm
that decision.
I turn then to the additional evidence which has been
discussed for the first time today.
The first body of evidence relates to an allegation that the insurer,
WorkCover Queensland, was negligent in the way in which it dealt
Clarke's application for compensation. Such evidence is simply
inadmissible.
The scheme of the Act is that, as is not infrequently the case, if a claimant
for compensation is dissatisfied with the decision of
the insurer, he is
entitled to an administrative remedy before Q-COMP. If he is still
dissatisfied, the system requires that there
be a trial either in the Industrial
Magistrates Court or in the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission. The
issue at a trial
is whether or not the claimant did suffer an injury arising out
of or in the course of his employment, and the issue whether or not
employment was a significant contributing factor to the injury.
The trial is not by way of judicial review of the processes of the insurer or
of Q-COMP. It follows that that evidence about the
procedure followed may not
be led in this Court.
The second body of evidence to which Mr Clarke turns is the 'evidence' of
witnesses who were called at first instance. I doubt that
the power to allow
additional evidence extends to the process that Mr Clarke has in mind. Mr
Clarke has in mind that he should cross-examine
those witnesses. In the nature
of things, he knows the questions but he does not know the answers so he cannot
say what the evidence
would be. In any event, if there was an error in that the
right questions were not asked at first instance, it was the error of
acting for Mr Clarke. Appeals pursuant to s. 561 of the Act are about
correcting errors by an Industrial Magistrate or Industrial
Commissioner.
Section 561 is not about the correction of forensic errors made by an appellant
or those who act for them.
For the same reason, I reject the application to call some additional
evidence - for example from Dr Greenhill who was the treating
doctor, which
might well have been called at first instance.
I notice Mr Clarke's claim that depression has been a contributing factor to
the aggravation of his condition. This may well be correct.
Mr Clarke has now
made such a claim to WorkCover. It seems to me that the claim should be dealt
with in the ordinary way.
Additional evidence about the nature of the work performed by Mr Clarke seems
to me not to be evidence which should be allowed pursuant
to the power to allow
additional evidence. Ordinarily, additional evidence should be allowed only
where it is almost certain or
reasonably clear that if the evidence had been
heard at first instance the result would be different. That must be so because,
it was to be a matter of weighing competing bodies of evidence, since this
Court has no power to remit the matter to the Commission,
an impossible
situation would arise in which the Court will be weighing evidence where the
Court heard some of it and the Commission
had heard the remainder of the
On the test whether it is almost certain or reasonably certain that the
additional evidence about the nature of the work performed
by Mr Clarke would
lead to a different result, there can only be one answer and that answer is
'no'. The reason for that is that
the Commissioner rejected the evidence of Dr
Murrell on the ground that Dr Murrell had taken up Mr Clarke's cause. On that
the medical evidence was that which came from Dr Sinha and Dr
Dr Sinha's evidence varied at times but in the end result, it seems to have
been that some toxins only would operate as a trigger
upon a person with a
relevant genetic disposition. It was the evidence of Dr Reid that performance
of work in the industry in which
Mr Clarke had been working would not of itself
operate as a trigger. In those circumstances, simply to call additional
toxins to which Mr Clarke had been exposed would not lead to
any different
I notice that Mr Clarke has sought some advice from the University of New
South Wales about the toxins which are contained in the
residue from
sandblasting. Nobody knows what the University of New South Wales will say
additional evidence when I do not know
what the evidence is.
In all those circumstances, I dismiss all aspects
of the application to lead additional evidence.".
