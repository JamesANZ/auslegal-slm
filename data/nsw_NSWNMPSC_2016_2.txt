REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Professional Standards Committee held an Inquiry into the conduct of RN Selby
and RN Phillips relating to the care of Patient
A, a six month old infant.
Patient A came into the care of RN Phillips and RN Selby whilst he was an
inpatient at Shoalhaven District
Memorial Hospital.
10 May 2016 this Professional Standards Committee made findings of
unsatisfactory professional conduct against both RN Phillips
and RN Selby (see
HCCC v Selby & Phillips
[2016] NSWNMPSC 5).
That decision, published
on the Nursing and Midwifery Council of NSW website, reserved on the question of
protective orders with
respect to RN Phillips (hereinafter referred to as Ms
Phillips as explained below) and made findings and consequent orders with
respect to RN Selby.
further Directions Hearing was held on 20 May 2016 in the matter of Ms Phillips.
The parties had been provided with a copy of
HCCC v Selby & Phillips
[2016]. The parties agreed that the matter could proceed by way of written
submissions, neither party wanting to adduce further evidence.
The HCCC made
written submissions dated 15 June 2016 and 5 August 2016. Written submissions on
behalf of Ms Phillips were dated 4
August 2016. This document now sets out the
decision of the Committee regarding consequential protective orders and should
in conjunction with
HCCC v Selby & Phillips
Committee was advised in mid-July 2016 that Ms Phillips had taken steps to
remove her name from the Register of Nurses. At the
time of publication of this
decision document Ms Phillips is no longer a registered nurse. For this reason
the Committee has reverted
to using the title of ‘Ms’ when referring
to Jane Phillips.
Committee is not aware of any impediment to Ms Phillips obtaining registration,
should she wish to make an application and pay
the relevant fee. In this
circumstance the Committee has considered the evidence before it from the
Inquiry and the written submissions
in determining to issue a reprimand to Ms
Phillips and to record the conditions that would have been placed on her
registration,
had she remained on the Register. While the Committee understands
that these conditions will not automatically be placed upon any
registration
that may be granted to Ms Phillips in the future, the Committee anticipates that
the Nursing and Midwifery Board of
Australia (NMBA) may give them some
consideration. The Committee notes one of the purposes of the National Law is to
place restrictions
on the practice of a health practitioner registered under the
scheme only if it is necessary to ensure health services are provided
are of an appropriate quality (s3(3)(c)). This Committee has had the benefit of
holding an Inquiry and having the opportunity
to test evidence in reaching a
view regarding the orders appropriate to fulfil this purpose. The Committee also
notes there is no
provision under the National Law for the NMBA to hold such an
Inquiry when considering any application for (re)registration that
may be made
by Ms Phillips in the future.
Summary of background and
detailed in
HCCC v Selby & Phillips
[2016] Patient A, a six month old
infant, was taken by his parents to the Emergency Department of Shoalhaven
Memorial Hospital (the
Hospital) on 19 October 2013. Patient A came under the
care of Ms Phillips from around 2245 hours until 0715 hours on 20 October
full Complaint made by the HCCC against Ms Phillips is set out in
Selby & Phillips
[2016]. In summary the Committee found Ms Phillips
failed to communicate information regarding observations made of Patient A and
his fluid balance to Patient A’s treating medical practitioner (Particular
1 of the Complaint) and failed to assess and/or
maintain adequate records of
various observations (Particular 2 of the Complaint).
Phillips admitted Particulars 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), 1 (d) and 1(e) of the Complaint.
The Committee found unsatisfactory professional
conduct established in that Ms
Phillips’ conduct demonstrated that the knowledge, skill and judgment
possessed and care exercised
by her in the practice of nursing was significantly
below the standard reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level
of training or experience.
Phillips did not admit Particular 2. The Committee found Particular 2
established and that the failures of Ms Phillips to make
assessments and
maintain the particularised records was well below the standard reasonably
expected of a practitioner of an equivalent
level of training or experience. Ms
Phillips agreed under cross-examination that with the benefit of hindsight she
should have undertaken
the assessments of Patient
Considerations re protective orders
HCCC v Selby & Phillips
[2016] the observations made by the Committee
regarding Ms Phillips included:
She did not
undertake more frequent observations of Patient A despite her stated knowledge
of his condition
She ultimately
accepted that she thought she had not read the clinical notes from the Emergency
Department for Patient A well enough
Ms Phillips
accepted that during her shift Patient A had deteriorated from the time he was
seen in the Emergency Department by Dr
Greenacre (Patient A’s admitting
paediatrician) and that she did not inform Dr Greenacre
She failed to
adhere to the NSW Health Policy on Gastroenteritis (exhibit 54)
She relied upon
what she considered to be Dr Greenacre’s
‘usual practice’
with respect to naso-gastric fluid rehydration therapy when she discontinued
the feed to Patient A at about 2330 hours and recommenced
it at a lower rate
more than two hours later and did not inform Dr Greenacre of this departure from
his orders (No formal or ‘standing
orders’ were in place to support
this departure)
She did not
provide nursing care that responded to the fact that Patient A was tachycardic,
that he had vomited and was oliguric at
She failed to
record the findings of the physical examination of Patient A said to have
occurred at around midnight and then again
at around 0600 hours
She failed to
communicate or ensure Dr Greenacre was aware of two moderate sized vomits and
the urinalysis results (save for inadequately
completing the fluid balance
Her evidence did
not provide the Committee with confidence that she could adequately perform,
assess or interpret a fluid assessment
Committee accepted the criticism of Ms Phillips’ conduct made by the peer
reviewer, CNS Chellew, as set out in
HCCC v Selby & Phillips
In summary, the Committee detailed concerns regarding Ms Phillips’
failures to identify and respond to observations
of Patient A reflecting poor
clinical understanding.
Committee expressed detailed concerns regarding Ms Phillips’ clinical
reasoning as detailed in
HCCC v Selby & Phillips
Committee notes that since October 2013 Ms Phillips had undertaken a Performance
Assessment process and further training (Detect
Junior Train the Trainer). Ms
Phillips asserted in her statement (paragraph 68) that she was confident of her
‘recognise and respond to signs and symptoms of clinical
deterioration in a sick child’
after her 30 years of clinical practice
in Paediatric nursing. This ability was not demonstrated by the evidence before
the Committee
regarding her conduct on 19/20 October 2013. There was extensive
canvassing of Ms Phillips’ conduct, in particular by reference
various Ministry of Health (formerly the Department of Health) policy documents,
both in cross-examination and questioning
from the Committee. The Committee
formed the view that a reprimand is warranted in the circumstances. It will
serve as a warning
to Ms Phillips and to the profession of the need for
providing appropriate nursing care. It also draws attention to the need for
vigilance in the application of all relevant policies. However, a reprimand in
itself is not sufficient to protect the public safety
in light of the deficits
identified in Ms Phillips’ practice should she regain registration. Had Ms
Phillips remained on the
Register of Nurses the Committee would have proceeded
to impose conditions on her registration.
changes Ms Phillips stated she had made to her practice subsequent to the events
of 19/20 October 2013 did not demonstrate to
the Committee that she had changed
her clinical practice in a reflective manner nor did it accord with contemporary
practice as detailed
in Ministry of Health policies such as NSW Health Clinical
Practice Guidelines Children and Infants with Gastroenteritis –
Management and Junior Detect, Detecting Deterioration, Evaluation, Treatment,
Escalation and Communicating in Teams, The Paediatric
Approach. Further, it did
not demonstrate the development of clinical reasoning and insight as a result of
having undertaken the
Junior Detect course in this intervening period.
primary role of the Committee is protective. The Committee also has a role in
maintaining public confidence in the profession
and maintaining the reputation
of the profession:
HCCC v Litchfield
(1997) 41 NSWLR 630. Decisions of
this Committee should also act as a general deterrent to other registered health
practitioners.
at 2013 Ms Phillips was a registered nurse of around 34 years standing. She had
held the position of Clinical Nurse Specialist
in the Ward between 1990 and
1994. Ms Phillips had also completed a Certificate in Acute Care Paediatric
Nursing at the then NSW
College of Nursing, and completed Paediatric Life
Support Course in 2011 (8 Hours), the Ins and Outs of Paediatric
Gastroenterology
Conference at SCH (8 Hours), the Resus4Kids Train the Trainer
Workshop in 2012 and a Paediatric Emergency Guidelines Online Knowledge
evaluation test in May 2013. Although, on the evidence before it, the Committee
had reservations regarding whether or not Ms Phillips
had complied with the
compulsory professional development requirements for maintaining registration,
the Committee is of the view
that it is appropriate to consider Ms Phillips was,
as at 2013, an appropriately qualified and very experienced registered nurse.
The National Law requires that the Committee benchmark her conduct against what
would be expected of a registered nurse of equivalent
training and experience.
The Committee found Ms Phillips’ conduct was significantly below the
standard expected.
Phillips provided a number of references to the Committee. Whilst these
references were supportive, they do not address the deficits
identified by the
Committee with Ms Phillips’ practice. They do provide support for Ms
Phillips returning to practice with
some support and remediation. The Committee
sets out below the protective orders it considers would have been appropriate
Phillips remained on the Register of Nurses as at the time of this
Committee has issued a reprimand to Ms Phillips. In the event that she applies
for re-registration the Committee is of the view
this reprimand should be
maintained on her Registration. The Committee is of the view that this is not an
appropriate matter for
the NMBA to exercise its discretion under s226(3) of the
National Law (NSW) and remove the reprimand from Ms Phillips’ registration
at any time in the future. Whilst Ms Phillips had taken some steps (such as
completing the Junior Detect Course) to remediate the
deficits in her practice
the Committee is of the view that the reprimand will serve as a warning to her
not to fall into unsatisfactory
conduct in the future.
Committee is of the view that the conditions detailed below would ensure the
nursing care provided by Ms Phillips, should she
safe and of an appropriate quality.

Australia other than in New South Wales, so
that the appropriate review body in
those circumstances is the relevant National Board.
