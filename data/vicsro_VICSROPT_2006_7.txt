Contractors - 180-day exemption (PT-127) [2006] VICSROPT 7 (1 November 2006)
Contractors � 180-day exemption
Revenue Rulings
Payroll Tax Act 1971
(the Act) deems
a person (whether incorporated or not) who entered
into a `relevant contract' with a business (the principal)
to be an employee of the principal, and payments to
such persons to be wages for the purposes of the Act.
Deemed wages under
of the Act are subject
to pay-roll tax.
While most contracts for the provision for services
come within the meaning of `relevant contracts'
of the Act, there are certain types
of contracts that are specifically excluded from
the definition of `relevant contracts'. One of these
exclusions is a contract for services of a kind ordinarily
required by the principal for less than 180 days in
a financial year
(section 3C(1)(e)(ii)
of the Act).
Accordingly, payments made under such a contract are
exempt from pay-roll tax.
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to explain the
180-day exemption under
section 3C(1)(e)(ii)
Act and provide examples to clarify the application of
this exemption.
The 180-day exemption is different from the 90-day
exemption provided by
section 3C(1)(e)(iii)
in the sense that while the 90-day exemption involves
the determination of the number of days an individual
contractor provides services to a principal, the 180-
day exemption requires a determination of the total
number of days a particular type of service is required
by the principal (regardless of whether the service has
been provided by contractors and/or employees). For
further explanation of the 90-day exemption, please
fer to Revenue Ruling PT.119.
The 180-day exemption focuses on the number
of days for which a particular type of service is
ordinarily required by the principal in a financial
year. This exemption is recognition of the fact that
some businesses require certain ad hoc services to
operate effectively but do not require these services
for the whole year. Furthermore, seasonal businesses
may require certain essential services to operate
effectively but do not require these services for the
whole year. Where a particular service is provided by
both employees and contractors, the number of days
for which such a service is provided to the principal
by both the contractors and employees is taken into
account in determining whether or not the 180-day
exemption is applicable.
For the purposes of the180-day exemption, services
required for part of a day will count as a full day.
The days for which the type of service is required do
not have to be consecutive. It is the total number of
days for which a particular type of service is ordinarily
required during the financial year that is relevant.
In essence, where a type of service is required by an
employer for less than 180 days in a financial year,
payments to all contractors providing that service are
exempt even though an individual contractor may have
worked for more than 90 days.
In the following examples, it is assumed that the
principals do not engage employees to perform
the type of services discussed in the financial year
A ski school operator in the Victorian snow fields
engages a number of ski instructors each year for 120
days during the snow season. The business has no
requirement for the services of ski instructors outside
of the snow season.
Section 3C(1)(e)(ii)
of the Act is
satisfied in this situation as the services are required for
less than 180 days in a financial year.
Consequently, the contracts that the ski instructors
entered into with the ski school operator are not
`relevant contracts'. Payments made to the contract
ski instructors are exempt from pay-roll tax even if
each ski instructor has worked more than 90 days in a
particular financial year.
A building company engages the services of a
landscape gardener (Landscaper A) to perform
landscaping services for 100 days in a financial year. A
second landscape gardener (Landscaper B) is engaged
to perform the same services concurrently for 95 days.
No other landscaping work is required by this building
company for the rest of the financial year.
As the building company only requires landscaping
services for 100 days in the financial year, section
Revenue Ruling PT.127
Replaces PT.053
3C(1)(e)(ii) of the Act is satisfied. Accordingly, neither
contract with Landscaper A nor Landscaper B is a
`relevant contract' and payments made under either
contract are not subject to pay-roll tax.
On the other hand, if Landscaper B performed the
95 days of service after Landscaper A has completed
his 100 days of service, the exemption in section
3C(1)(e)(ii) of the Act does not apply because the total
number of days that the building company requires
landscaping services is 195 (100 days + 95 days). As
a result, contracts entered into with Landscaper A and
Landscaper B are `relevant contracts' under 3C of the
Act and payments made under these contracts are
subject to pay-roll tax.

law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
