Sensitive documents left on printer [2005] NSWPrivCmr 2 (1 January 2005)
Sensitive documents left on printer
The following case study is concerned with the handling of
employees’ personal information by managers in a regional office
large NSW public sector agency.
It appears that on a number of occasions
management had left sensitive personnel documents around the office, unsecured
and in full
view of other staff. Specific instances included a personnel file
left in an interview room and performance reports left in a common
area near a
On both occasions the documents were left unsecured for
prolonged periods of time. Concerned employees considered this conduct to
breach of their privacy and took advantage of the internal review process in the
(the PPIP Act).
The agency concerned conducted the reviews promptly and thoroughly. As
part of the process, the manager who left the documentation
unsecured was
interviewed and the information in question was analysed to determine whether it
was ‘personal information’
as defined in section 4 of the PPIP
The review concluded that the information in question fell within
the exemption in section 4(3)(j) "information or an opinion about
individual’s suitability for appointment or employment as a public sector
official" and, consequently, there was no breach
of the PPIP Act. The review
found, however, that the conduct of the manager amounted to bad practice in
relation to the security
of personal details.
The manager acknowledged
his mistake and apologised to the employees involved. Approval was obtained to
install a separate printer
in the manager’s office to ensure that
personnel information would be handled in a more confidential and secure manner
out to the agency that the conduct complained about would have arguably
constituted a breach of section 12 of the PPIP Act, "Retention and security of
personal information", if not for the finding that
the information was exempted
from the definition of ‘personal information’. We recommended
strengthening the findings
to reflect the fact that the conduct complained about
was essentially poor privacy practice.
The agency considered our
submission, and added a further recommendation to address the matter relating to
the lack of security of
confidential personnel information at the regional
level, and to undertake an audit of the general handling of personnel
information
by management, having regard to the agency’s relevant policies
and procedures.
Internal review case study,
should be careful with employees’ personal information
