STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
Franklin Kipkorir (the claimant) sought a review of the decision of Merit
Reviewer Ruschen. In her certificate dated 30 January
2024 Merit Reviewer
Ruschen set aside the reviewable decision of the insurer and certified the
claimant’s pre-accident weekly
earnings (PAWE) as $460.60.

payments of statutory benefits under Division

Kipkorir was studying in Australia at the time of the accident. He was studying
full time on a student visa which permitted him
to work 28 hours per fortnight
during study terms. The Visa was granted on 19 July 2023 and required him to
enter Australia by 30
August 2023.

Kipkorir started working as a casual freight handler with Chandler Macleod on
12 September 2023. He was paid the sum of $421.66
gross on 20 September
2023. He was paid the sum of $776.20 gross on 27 September 2023 (two days after
the accident).
Kipkorir was involved in the motor vehicle accident on 25 September 2023 (the
Application for Personal Injury Benefits was lodged on 3 October 2023.
13 November 2023 the insurer wrote to Mr Kipkorir and advised that his PAWE had
been assessed at $761.21 (the PAWE decision). This
decision relied only on the
earnings from Chandler Macleod including the payment on 27 September 2023 for
work undertaken pre- accident.
Kipkorir requested an internal review of the PAWE decision on 13 November 2023.
Mr Kipkorir asked that his cash in hand labouring
job be included in the
PAWE assessment. He said he was paid between $250 and $300 per day and the hours
varied between three to eight
hours per day.
28 November 2023 the insurer issued an internal Review Certificate affirming the
PAWE decision.
Kipkorir lodged an application with the Personal Injury Commission (Commission)
in respect of the PAWE dispute.
THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION
1, cl 4 of the MAI Act provides:
“Meaning of
‘pre-accident weekly earnings’--general
(1) ‘Pre-accident weekly earnings’, in relation to an earner who
is injured as a result of a motor accident, means the
weekly average of the
gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during the 12 months
immediately before the day on which
the motor accident occurred, unless
subclause (2) applies.
(2) In the following cases,
’pre-accident weekly earnings’
, in relation to an earner who is injured as a result of a motor accident,
(a) if, on the day of the motor accident, the earner was earning continuously,
but had not been earning continuously for at least
12 months--the weekly average
of the gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during the period from
when the earner started
to earn continuously to immediately before the day of
the motor accident,
(a1) if the earner was employed or self-employed during a period or periods
equal to at least 26 weeks during the first year of the
pre-accident period, but
was not obtaining earnings from any source at any other time during the
pre-accident period--the average
weekly gross earnings received by the earner as
an earner during the first year of the pre-accident period,
(b) if subclause (3) applies--the weekly average of the gross earnings the
earner received as an earner, or could reasonably have
been expected to receive,
during the 12 months after the change of circumstance referred to in the
subclause occurred,
(c) if the earner is an earner by reason of having entered into an arrangement
with an employer or other person to undertake employment
or to commence business
as a self-employed person--the average weekly gross earnings that the earner
could reasonably have been expected
to earn, but for the injury, in employment
under that arrangement.
‘pre-accident period’
, in relation to a motor
accident, is the period of 2 years immediately preceding the motor
(3) This subclause applies if, during the 12 months immediately before the
day of the motor accident, there was, as a result of any
action taken by the
earner, a significant change in his or her earnings circumstances that resulted
in the earner regularly earning,
or becoming entitled to earn, more on a weekly
basis than he or she was earning before the change occurred.
Examples of a change of circumstances to which this subclause
would apply include a change of job, a promotion, a move from part-time
full-time employment, or a pay increase arising from the achievement of
performance standards.
(4) For the purposes of this clause, an earner earns continuously if he or
she obtains earnings from permanent employment or from
a source that, on the day
of the motor accident, was likely to continue for a period of at least 6 months
to provide earnings to
the earner on the same, or a similar, basis to the basis
on which the earnings were being provided as at that day.”
DECISION OF MERIT REVIEWER RUSCHEN
Reviewer Ruschen issued a certificate and reasons for decision dated 30 January
Reviewer Ruschen agreed the PAWE should be calculated in accordance with
Schedule 1 cl 4(2)(a) on the basis there was no evidence
Mr Kipkorir was earning
continuously before he arrived in Australia.
Reviewer Ruschen calculated the PAWE in respect of earnings received between
4 August 2023 and 24 September 2023 including earnings
from Benjamin
Figueira. However, she did not include in her calculation the claimant’s
earnings with Chandler Macleod of $776.20
received on 27 September 2023 on the
basis the PAWE is “the weekly average of the gross earnings received by
the earner as
an earner during the period from when the earner first started to
earn continuously to immediately before the day of the motor accident”.
other words, Merit Reviewer Ruschen considered any earnings received on or after
the day of the accident were excluded by the wording
of cl4(2)(a) regardless of
whether the work was carried out before the day of the accident.
claimant also highlighted in his bank statements cash deposits, namely $800 on
14 August 2023 and $2,150 and $36 on 20 August
2023. Merit Reviewed Ruschen
did not include these deposits as earnings where there is no third party payer
identified, no description
suggesting the payments represented wages and no
documents to verify those transactions as income.
Reviewer Ruschen noted the period from 4 August 2023 to 24 September 2023 (the
day before the accident) totalled 52 days. Total
payments received during that
period including $421.56 from Chandler Macleod and $3,000 from Benjamin Figueira
totalled $3,421.45,
or a daily average of $65.80 ($3,421.45 ÷ 52). The
daily average equated to a gross weekly average of $460.60. Merit Reviewer
Ruschen determined the claimant’s PAWE to be
SUBMISSIONS
his application Mr Kipkorir stated the decision of Merit Reviewer Ruschen was
incorrect because she omitted $776.20 earnt before
25 September 2023 but paid on
27 September 2023, failed to take into account all cash payments and applied the
wrong formula. He
stated he worked as a labourer continuously and most of the
time was paid in cash including a cash deposit he made as a result of
as a labourer. Mr Kipkorir stated he sought a teleconference before a decision
was made so he could obtain a fair judgement.
Zogopoulos stated the insurer did not wish to make any submissions given the
insurer had originally calculated the PAWE in excess
of the figure certified by
Merit Reviewer Ruschen.

stayed with friends who worked in the construction industry. On Monday 31 July
2023 he bought the clothes and other things necessary
to work on a construction
site. On Tuesday, 1 August 2023 he went with his friends to a construction
site and he was engaged to undertake
casual labouring work. He stated there was
no formal arrangement. He would turn up and would be directed to undertake
labouring tasks,
for example, cleaning the site, moving bricks or moving other
building materials. He worked on a lot of constructions sites mainly
at Carramar
and Villawood and he also worked one day in another suburb whose name he cannot
Kipkorir stated he was paid a rate of $250 per day and $300 per day on Sundays
regardless of the hours worked. He said he often
only worked until 12 noon or
Kipkorir stated other than Mr Figueira all employers paid by cash and it was
simply a matter of turning up and doing as directed.
He said he enjoyed the work
and only commenced work with Chandler Macleod because he understood in summer
there may be days when
work on construction sites would not be available due to
extreme heat.
Kipkorir stated the deposits of $800 on 14 August 2023 and $2,150 and $36 on 20
August 2023 were from his cash earnings on construction
sites. When questioned
the bank on 20 August 2023 and
deposited notes totalling $2,150 and he made a
separate deposit of coins totalling $36. These monies were accumulated from cash
on building sites.
Kipkorir was careful to quarantine other sums he had received from other
sources. He stated when he arrived from Kenya he had $4,000
and he had been sent
the sum of $12,560 from home on 12 September 2023 to set him up in his studies.
Review Panel notes there can be no criticism of the insurer where Ms Zogopoulos
commented that this evidence as to the claimant’s
cash earnings on
building sites was not available to the insurer at the time the insurer made the
reviewable PAWE decision.
REVIEW PANEL FINDINGS
Review Panel agrees the PAWE should be calculated in accordance with schedule 1
cl 4(2)(a) of the MAI Act where there is no evidence
to demonstrate that Mr
Kipkorir was earning continuously for at least 12 months before the day of the
Gross earnings received.

dispute is the payment received from Chandler Macleod in the sum of $776.20 on
27 September 2023. There is no dispute the payment
was in respect of work
performed by the claimant before the date of the accident. The dispute turns on
the interpretation of the
words “the weekly average of the gross earnings
by the earner as an earner during the period from when the
earner started to earn continuously to immediately before the day of the
accident” as they appear in Schedule 1, cl 4(2)(a) of the MAI Act.
Project Blue Sky v ABA
Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ
“The duty of a court is to give the words of a
statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended
them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with
the grammatical meaning...But not always. The context
of the words, the
consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the
statute or the canons of construction
may require the words of a legislative
provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or
grammatical meaning.”
Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue
High Court stated whilst regard is to be had to the context and purpose of a
statute including the legislative history and extrinsic
materials, such
materials cannot displace the clear meaning of the
1.3(4) of the MAI Act provides:
“In the interpretation of a
provision of this Act or the regulations, a construction that would promote the
objects of this
Act or the provision is to be preferred to a construction that
would not promote those objects.”
objects of the MAI Act are set out in s 1.3(2) of the MAI Act and include:
(a) to encourage early and appropriate treatment and care to achieve optimum
recovery of persons from injuries sustained in motor
accidents and to maximise
their return to work or other activities,
(b) to provide early and ongoing financial support for persons injured in motor
1.3(3)(a) of the MAI Act provides that in the application and administration of
the Act the participants in the scheme have
shared and integrated roles with the
overall aim of benefiting all members of the motoring public by keeping the
overall costs of
the scheme within reasonable bounds to keep premiums affordable
and of promoting the recovery and return to work of those injured
in accidents.
Review Panel is satisfied it was the intention of the legislature to limit the
calculation of the PAWE to gross earnings received
to a period which ceases
immediately before the day of the accident. The text is clear. If the intention
had been to include payment
for work undertaken during the relevant period but
not received during the period ending immediately before the day of the accident
the legislature could have readily done so.
Review Panel is satisfied this interpretation satisfies the objects of the MAI
Act in promoting the recovery and return to work
of those injured in accidents
whilst keeping in mind the overall aim of keeping scheme premiums affordable.
Accordingly,
the Review Panel does not propose to take into consideration the sum of $776.20
received on 27 September 2023 where it
was not received before the day of the
Review Panel agrees the earnings received from Benjamin Figueira on 4 August
2023, 19 August 2023, 26 August 2023, 2 September
2023 and 23 September 2023
totalling $3,000 were gross earnings received by the claimant during the
relevant period.
Review Panel determined the evidence of Mr Kipkorir as to his additional cash
earnings on construction sites was persuasive and
was satisfied that the
deposits on 14 August 2023 and 20 August 2023 totalling $2,986 were gross
earnings received by the claimant
during the relevant period.
the total gross earnings of $6,407.56 comprise the sum of $421.56 from Chandler
Macleod, the sum of $3,000 from Benjamin
Figueira and the additional cash
earnings of $2,986.
Period for calculation
calculating the relevant period over which the weekly average of the gross
earnings is calculated the Review Panel notes that the
wording in schedule 1
cl 4(2)(a) provides that the period for calculation is the day that the
claimant commenced to “earn continuously”
rather than the date when
he commenced to “receive” earnings.
means the time over which the calculation is required to be averaged commences
on the date the claimant
started to earn
continuously whilst the amount
is determined by the gross earnings
during the relevant period.
Review Panel is satisfied on the evidence of the claimant that he commenced to
earn continuously on 1 August 2023.
Review Panel finds the period over which the claimant’s PAWE is to be
averaged under schedule 1 cl 4(2)(a) is 1 August 2023
to 24 September 2023, the
day before the accident, which is a period of 55 days.
CALCULATION OF PAWE
Review Panel calculates the PAWE in accordance with Schedule 1 cl 4(2)(a) of the
MAI Act as follows:
(a) the claimant first began earning continuously on 1 August 2023;
(b) the claimant’s PAWE is averaged over the period from 1 August 2023 to
24 September 2023, a period of 55 days;
(c) during the period 1 August 2023 to 24 September 2023 the claimant received
gross earnings of $6,407.56, and
(d) the claimant’s average gross weekly earnings in the period 1 August
2023 to 24 September 2023 is $815.50.
PANEL CONCLUSION
Review Panel revokes the certificate of Merit Reviewer Ruschen.
Review Panel certifies the claimant’s pre-accident weekly earnings to be
