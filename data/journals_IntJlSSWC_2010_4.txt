WELFARE SUPPORT AND ‘SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE’
IN A RECESSIONARY WORLD LABOUR MARKET
POST-NEOLIBERALISM OR NOT?
During the recent boom in the world economy, many western developed
countries, of varying political complexion, adopted neoliberal
welfare policies
and deregulated labour markets. For the unemployed these reforms were
characterised by contracting-out of labour
exchange functions (public employment
agencies), and strong sanctions for non-compliance with ‘activation’
policies to
engage or reconnect social security recipients with the workforce.
The 2008 world financial crisis, and policies pursued by a centre-left
government in Australia indicate the potential for greater emphasis on social
protection, social inclusion, upskilling/training or
public value creation. The
change of agenda, though not entirely substantive, is worthy of interrogation.
This paper reviews Australian
progress towards alternative paradigms and
prospects of more radical ‘capacity building’ agendas.
I INTRODUCTION
Over recent decades a new form of governance of state services has emerged.
Termed ‘neoliberalism’, it involves not so
much a question of
changing what government does, but rather the
Instead of planning and
delivering state services, neoliberalism contracts service delivery out to
non-government actors, mainly
for-profit businesses or not-for-profit charitable
agencies. In a well known rowing metaphor, this is characterised as confining
government to ‘steering’, rather than both steering and rowing. By
putting market mechanisms at the core of the new delivery
mode, the theory
anticipates that programs will be both more efficiently delivered (at lower
economic and ‘bureaucratic’
costs) and in a more flexible or
responsive manner.
A considerable body of literature has emerged to interrogate the claims of
and criticisms against this new model of governance, commonly
captured in the
concept of ‘new public management’ (NPM) widely applied by scholars
in law, governance and social policy.
In social policy fields such as social
security entitlements for the unemployed which is the focus of the present
review article,
a prominent theme has been the extent to which any efficiencies
or service flexibilities are gained at the expense of other values
as insistence on behavioural change by the unemployed on pain of sanctions
(under the rubric of ‘reciprocal responsibility’)
and a weakening of
accountability protections both to government and for
As Schramm et al comment in respect of US welfare reform, ‘[w]elfare
policies for the poor have been redesigned in recent years
to reflect the idea
that the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring that socially marginal
groups practice appropriate
This was true of
some but not all aspects of welfare reform under the former Australian
Conservative Government led by John Howard.
Under the Howard regime, Australia adopted modified versions of US neoliberal
forms of governance (such as being an early leader in
marketising the delivery
of labour matching services for the
unemployed),
along with specific
policy prescriptions both for the labor market (deregulation) and welfare:
including an economically-purist rationale
for its ‘welfare-to-work’
and embrace of the more
authoritarian overtones of ‘mutual obligation’ (and penalties for
non-compliance) drawn from
Lawrence Mead’s ideas about moral
responsibility and ‘character’ in overcoming lack of work or
impoverishment.
In public administration terms, Australia’s Job Network embraced the
new public management approach to employment services
governance,
with service provider
value-for-money and expedient job placement criteria dominating over equity and
the socially progressive outcomes
associated with intensive assistance for
long-term unemployed and more disadvantaged jobseekers. As Harris argued,
neoliberal welfare
reform in Australia was characterised by the themes of
competition, individualisation and
authoritarianism.
In combination,
labour-market deregulation and social security reform constituted an
exacerbating ‘pincher’
especially for
vulnerable workers, including Australia’s high proportions of casual and
part-time workers, along with those
with multiple barriers to employment, such
as the mentally ill.
As we argue below, taking a macro view of compliance within employment
brokerage in the new regime called Job Services Australia (JSA),
the current
Labor Government’s tentative moves towards tempering the previous
government’s neoliberal excesses do not
constitute a move toward
European-style jobseeker capacity building. While enhancing some protections,
neither do they add public
value to a system which was, from its original
conception and after implementation, deemed radically commercialised by both
and international
A Labor Government reforms
Following the election of the Australian Labor Party under Kevin Rudd in late
2007 — replaced as Prime Minister by Julia Gillard
by a party room vote in
June 2010 — a semblance of balance has been restored to labour law,
knocking the rougher edges off
the so-called ‘WorkChoices’ reforms
and re-establishing vital regulatory protections for workers and trade
In welfare, the incoming Rudd Government effectively provided belated
recognition to the critique of the overly-heavy penalty regime
first raised
eight years earlier by an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) report reviewing recent Australian
‘innovations’ in labour
market policies, sub-titled ‘the Australian
This was achieved by
converting the scheme of lengthy penalties (high percentage rate reductions or
total loss of payments for several
weeks), across a wide range of allegedly
non-compliant behaviour, to instead favour temporary loss of portion of a social
installment (effectively a day at a time), over a narrower range of
core conduct, and only until a person complies (portrayed as
a ‘No show,
No pay’ policy).
The Howard Government expressed little apparent interest in social inclusion
or capacity-building policies,
and the new government has taken only tentative steps in that direction by
establishing a Social Inclusion
Instead, the main focus has been on investing in classical labour-market
programs, such as training places for the unemployed; including
a July 2009
Council of Australian Governments (COAG) decision extending the subsidised
training guarantee places for youth under
25 to cover all retrenched workers (or

B The new welfare compliance regime
Welfare compliance since 1 July 2009 now relies more on encouraging
connection and cooperation than on fear of standardised loss of
penalties; though both elements remain.
The no-show no-pay policy, expressed in the amended
Social Security
(Administration) Act 1999
(Cth), operates mainly by first identifying
‘connection failures’ (such as not keeping an appointment with a
s 42E(2)(c)).
Connection failures can trigger imposition of a
‘reconnection obligation’ (including notification of consequences
failure to honour it:
, but otherwise they attract no immediate
No-show no-pay penalties for breach of reconnection
obligations
are attracted
variously by conduct such as not participating in (or misconduct during) an
activity contained in an ‘Employment
Pathway Plan’ (the new name for
former ‘Job Search Agreements’), failure to honour an obligation
imposed for a
so-called ‘serious’ connection breach, and for
‘intentionally act[ing] in a manner ... (including by failing to
job interview), [which] it is reasonably foreseeable ... could result in an
offer of employment not being made to the
Penalties are set by legislative instrument, not exceeding the amount of the
payment for the day(s) in
For episodes like not
attending an interview, it is loss of pay for that
or in the case of ‘ongoing’ participation breaches, loss of
payment for each day between the day of initial breach and
the day prior to its
rectification.
Unlike the former
regime, however, the loss does not commence to be imposed until
person is advised of, and is thus able to contest, the alleged
reconnection requirement’ can be imposed if the first is not
discharged.
Eight week penalties (of total loss of payment according to
Social Security (Administration) Act 1999
(Cth)) are now confined to
‘serious misconduct’, such as ‘persistently’ failing to
comply with obligations
of a participation payment, ‘including by
committing no show no pay failures, connection failures or reconnection
These penalties
may not be imposed without first undertaking a ‘comprehensive compliance
assessment’,
triggered by three unexcused failures in six months. Nor may they be applied
where the person lacks capacity to comply,
or where serving the penalty would
cause severe financial hardship.
Acceptance of a person’s intention to now comply serves to terminate the
period prior to eight weeks.
Fixed-term, eight week loss of payment penalties continue to be applied

II EVALUATION: LIBERALISM CONFOUNDED BY DIFFERENCE AND
VULNERABILITY?
The various changes to the Job Network (now Job Services Australia, or JSA)
to invest more funds in those classified as long-term
or multiply-disadvantaged
unemployed,
and to shift to a no-show no-pay welfare penalty system, are welcome but
flawed measures, very prone to exposure by rising unemployment
consequent on the
world financial crisis.
A A Duck is a Duck is a Duck; Markets are hard to
The first difficulty, centred on the changes to the JSA, is that it remains a
contracted-out network of service providers; or a welfare

the new government’s recent tender round is open to criticism for
tendering the whole sector rather than taking a more
flexible, staged approach,
and for being predicated on a more buoyant labour market than now prevails.
In de-coupling the JSA from its former close nexus to a tough welfare
sanctions regime, however, government appears tacitly to have
recognised that
welfare-to-work, and mutual obligation measures, may have been over-sold as
remedies for unemployment and poverty.
This is consistent with the research
evidence. Thus a US study of former Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) clients found
that it is the health or otherwise of the

engaged in the
labour force after initially obtaining work, whether willingly or due to
compulsion following loss of.
Likewise the long-term economic welfare of sole parents under US Temporary Aid
for Needy Families (TANF) programs showed little or
improvement,
and similar
conclusions were drawn from a meta-review of studies published by the US Center
for Budget and Policy
Priorities.

B Killing Me Quietly: Liberalism’s
discrimination against the ‘demoralised’?
The welcome abandonment of quasi-criminal penalties for those unemployed who
are uncompliant with conditions for continued receipt
of social security,
remains somewhat problematic, however, because it arguably makes too few
adjustments for people who do not fit
the liberal template of the settled and
fully rational or autonomous individual.
Certainly the narrowing of breaches by excluding the former administrative
breaches (such as attendance at JN interviews) to simply
allow imposition of a
reconnection requirement, overcomes the ‘sudden death’ effect
previously triggered by minor infractions.
But a person without a settled abode
cannot readily respond favourably to the second chance which the reform offers;
and in 2006
the ABS found 104 646 Australians or 53 per 10 000 were
Nor will they – or people suffering from fluctuating mental illness or
an addiction, for example – recognise rapidly

time’ rule; and 13 per cent of Australians
reported being in high or very high levels of psychological distress in

The subjectivity of the language of
s 42C(1)(a)(iv)
Social Security
(Administration) Act 1999
(Cth) about intentionally acting in a manner
‘reasonably foreseeable’ as one which ‘could result in an
employment not being made’, is also open to over-use in the hands
of front-line decisionmakers, who may too lightly accept
the information relayed
from employers about what they found to be an unpalatable presentation or
attitude, particularly on the part
of people with mental illness or without a
settled abode.
There is some administrative recognition of such problems in the construction
by Centrelink of the protection of requiring a detailed
expert assessment of
personal barriers to employment. This report is now required before imposing
sanctions in respect of the narrower
range of conduct which continues to attract
such possibilities. However the more mundane and more common situation of what
term ‘impoverishment by lassitude’ seems not to be adequately
catered for so far.
Putting it more abstractly, the re-engineered compliance scheme still appears
to place too much store in liberal assumptions of the
autonomous and rational
individual. The vulnerabilities and individual differences of those comprising
the long-term or multiple-barrier
group need to be catered for in more nuanced
C Who Needs Law and Lawyers: The
‘marketisation’ of the rule of law?
For welfare clients, the neoliberal preference for contracting job brokerage
services out to quasi-markets like the Job Network was
problematic because it
tended to weaken public law accountability machinery.
Originally the social security rights of the unemployed were no less
protected by the operation of the rule of law than were other
categories of
recipients: with normative guidance set down either in legislation or rulings of
the merits review tribunals and

they risk being ‘parked’ (at best), or ‘sanctioned’
This was certainly borne
out by Australia’s experience with its ‘tough love’
welfare-to-work sanctions regime.
Thus 15 509 people suffered ‘three

of the 2006
reforms, compared to 6432 receiving the harshest of the then
‘tiered’ penalties under the previous

According to Horin, up to
200 000 people were said to have reached the ‘second strike’ risk
point by the time of the
change of government in late 2007.
Since the softening of the welfare sanctions regime mainly shrinks the size
of the populations at risk of the new ‘softer’
‘staged’ sanctions – rather than alter the
social security obligations (in ‘employment pathway plans’), or the
of the empowering of JSA job brokerage agencies – it must
be doubted whether anything other than the
of the problem will
alter. It is unlikely that merits review and court constructions of measures
such as the new comprehensive compliance
assessments will adopt a wide,
purposive view, directed at rigorously examining underlying causes of
disadvantage and disempowerment
of jobseekers. Compliance assessments instead
risk degenerating to pro forma requirements which will offer little real
for the most disadvantaged.
D We Are…, We Are…’We Are
Australian’:
Few hints of European capacity-building?
For its part, the emphasis on upgrading skills through longer-term training
or education may yet evolve into social security and labour
market programs more
akin to European models.
British and European ‘Third way’ policies pursue durable jobs and
place greater emphasis on building an educated and skilled
workforce as the
basis for economic prosperity and international
competitiveness.
Because the
object of these policies is to elide, or find a reconciliation between social
protection (as in social
) and markets (as in labour market
flexibility
), the most evocative term for these policies is
‘flexicurity’,
concept incorporating various combinations of job security, employment security,
income security and
‘work-life-balance’.
Among other things this embodies the idea of ‘transitional labour
markets’, involving reconceptualising employment from
point-in-time focus on labour supply and demand analyses at that time, to the
dynamic perspective of a workforce ‘career’,
where public policy
facilitates
stability through development of individual skills
and capacities and supportive pathways for new forms of
involvement.
As in other
countries, however, the worked examples of this new policy mix (such as those
pioneered in the Netherlands and Denmark)
included elements of
‘activation’ of the
unemployed.
They also often
included imposition of reciprocal ‘responsibilities’ to be met by
the unemployed as a condition of payment
under an imposed individual
‘behavioural contract’ designed to promote appropriate jobseeking
behaviours, as in Britain’s
various ‘new deal’ programs of the
former Labour Government,
model adapted from Australia.
In 2007, the European Commission and later the European Council of Ministers
of Labour and Social Affairs formally endorsed flexicurity
to describe an
alternative vision to that of neoliberalism and globalisation. This vision was
expressed in the reconciliation of
economic and social objectives enunciated in
the 1997 Luxembourg ‘European employment strategy’, later
incorporated into
the 2000 ‘Lisbon agenda for jobs and
Consistent with
the soft law idea of the ‘open method of consultation’ within the
EU, the eight principles adopted by
the ministers to elaborate on the notion of
flexicurity left wide scope for national variation around issues such as the
pursuit of ‘activation’ strategies for the unemployed, or
the suite of training and social protection
approaches.
At their more
expansive, these state interventions can be conceptualised as the
operationalisation of Amartya Sen or Martha Nussbaum’s
ideas around a
‘capabilities approach’ for assessing policy in terms of impacts on
what people can or cannot ‘do’,
by establishing a ‘third
way’ compromise between orthodox social protection and neoliberalism's
embrace of markets and
globalisation.

inclusion agenda was earlier embraced by Britain in the late 1990s, where Ruth
characterised it as a
paradigm shift from goals of equality towards a focus on social inclusion and
equality of opportunity, owing
more to US active society ideas (and reciprocal
obligations) than to European concepts of stakeholder inclusion. A perceived
overemphasis
on inclusion through work attracted early criticism, while mutual
aid was also found to be poorly accessed by the most
vulnerable.

Inclusion Board (SIB) report

building) is their woolly character.
observed in the context
of health services, such terms often replace the former embrace of
‘community’, another loose
and rather unhelpful term now rightly
rather out of favour in welfare
As a partial window on the question of social inclusion and capacity building
from a public administration
perspective,
the concept of
‘public value’ offers an alternate policy testing ground. One major
objective behind job brokerage, by
the very nature of the term, is to create a
wider base of deliberation, to place jobseekers while minimising the
misallocation of
the human resources which underpin the unemployed or
under-employed person. This serves as an alternative to approaches purely or
mainly reliant on commercial criteria such as service provider value-for-money.
Though the government is yet to prove itself on such
grounds, its 2020 Summit
along with the associated youth, schools and local summits sought to begin
society-wide conversations, and
the Final Report recommended a stronger role for
the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in bringing a ‘whole of
government’
approach to policy
The combination of the slightly softer sanctions as discussed here, and the
public-private partnerships and joined-up government which
underpinned the then
super-Ministry of Deputy Prime Minister and combined Minister for Employment,
Workplace Relations, Education
and Social Inclusion, provided early evidence
that public value had been put on the policy agenda, and there are indications
this is being maintained under the Gillard
Government.
Other indicators
include somewhat less commercialised employment services provision and greater
attention to the long-term unemployed
and double/multiple disadvantaged
jobseekers as discussed above. The interests of the collective of stakeholders

communities, as opposed to merely the individual customer or

funds invested in services and the language of connection and co-operation as
emphasised in JSA policy documents
also add weight.
Prime Ministerial speeches of the then PM Rudd, particularly those stemming
from the 2020 Summit, also indicated a recognition of
the need to foster
deliberative democracy. Perhaps ‘the ten core challenges for the
future’ including ‘[crafting]
our human capital’ and
‘building stronger communities’ encompass such a wider deliberative
Yet, as our analysis of compliance and sanctions under the JSA suggests,
finding tangible evidence of the
of public value is difficult.
Such a search, however, forms the axis upon which employment services policy
turns from here.
III CONCLUSION
Vulnerable clients with complex needs are at risk both within the
quasi-market of privatised job matching services and under the compliance
regimes of social security,
as they are at risk when in work if labour law regimes do not provide sufficient
protections against risks such as unfair dismissal
or adequate minimum wages and
conditions.
Social policy is always sensitive to its cultural and socio-political
but Australia’s
very pliable architecture and distinctive rationale of its social security
scheme has permitted it to be especially
responsive to change and
experimentation. Compared to other western industrialised countries, Australian
social security was a comparatively
late development, reliant on tax-funding
rather than being politically ‘embedded’ through shared social
insurance contributions,
and reflective of a more equivocal public policy stance
the nation’s ‘worker’s welfare state’ was very malleable
in comparison with contributory schemes. The
Australian model was always
sceptical about primary or long-term reliance on ‘welfare’, instead
seeing the welfare of
the unemployed as best advanced through
conditions, supplemented by transitory and fairly austere welfare
In addition, there are
no human rights protections to dampen change by softening the landings of the
vulnerable.
So the polity was
very receptive to replacement of socially protective policies for people of
workforce age by radical new ‘neoliberal’
agendas conceived within a
labour market or economic paradigm.
The recent partial softening of the impact of Australia’s former
neoliberal model of unemployment payments (and penalties for
breach of the
behavioural contracts) certainly shifted policy away from an over-emphasis on
personal responsibility as the basis
for welfare, which, as Robert Goodin
bears down in
ethically indefensible ways on the most vulnerable. However, rather than usher
in Third Way or capacity-building approaches
familiar to European social policy,
it leaves intact much of the distinctive architecture of Australia’s
austere and residualist
social policy for the
unemployed.
It also leaves
unresolved the questions of whether it has yet restored sufficient social
inclusion in the policy mix in order to
weather rising unemployment unleashed on
the vulnerable by the next economic downturn, and whether the neoliberal/NPM
model it inherited
sufficiently
Our analysis suggests that it has done this partially at best. But as found
the performance of EU
flexicurity during the world financial crisis of 2008-09 was very mixed,
suggesting that there are few policy
panaceas and that all welfare policies need
to be judged by reference to their own values, histories and cultures.

its most basic, the reason for the policy shift towards

The Social Security (Connecting People with Jobs)
Bill 2010 (Cth) proposes to extend, from 8 to 12 weeks, the penalty for
unemployment for participants in a two year trial of an active
regional labour market assistance package from January 2011. The scheme
provide relocation assistance for 2000 job-seekers unemployed for more than 12
months and residing in an area with higher than
national unemployment rates, in
order to take up continuing full time work (or apprenticeships). The incentives
are up to AUD6000
in relocation expenses (half that in urban areas) and an
additional AUD3000 for families with dependent children.
The main tranche of reform was to
review and re-tender the contracts of the former ‘Job Network’
(renamed as Job Services
Australia from July 2009). The 2008-09 Budget committed
AUD 3.7b to revamping the employment services system to increase the focus
work readiness and skills development, including tailored case-management and
better ties with employers. A new advisory body
was created (
Skills Australia
(Act No 10 of 2008)), and an additional 238 000 training places
were budgeted, at a cost of AUD880m, with ‘activity plans’
by ‘employment pathway plans’ more akin to the UK models. See

Quasi-markets and Social Policy
(Macmillan, 1993). The market is
artificially constructed―as government
(rather than economic
forces) set both the ‘price’ and define the nature of the
‘goods’ to be supplied, see
Auditor General ‘Management of the
Job Network Contracts’ (Audit Report No 44, Australian National Audit

In the absence of a real marketplace,
government is obliged to intervene by modifying contractual terms to ensure
providers remain
viable and that policies are achieved: see Hugh Collins

Mashaw, ibid 119, points out there are

governance;
those that police the marketplace; and those that inhabit the
non-governmental, non-market, social realm’. The Job Network,
and its JSA
successor, however, is a hybrid relationship which uneasily
