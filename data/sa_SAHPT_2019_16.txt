REPRESENTATION:
Complainant: Mr A

Solicitors:
Complainant: Landers
Respondent: N/A
Forbes appeared for the Complainant. The Respondent was unrepresented.
Tribunal had a frank exchange with Mr Leane and is satisfied that he is now
adequately informed of his rights. The Tribunal accepts
that Mr Leane is
happy to participate in these proceedings without legal
representation.
complaint reveals that the Respondent, whilst a registered health practitioner,
behaved in a way that constituted professional
misconduct. Mr Leane:
registration in about 22 November 2012;
on about 11
September 2015 the respondent’s registration was suspended by the
complainant;
was convicted of
criminal offences detailed Annexure A. The list is extensive;
failed to notify
within seven days the complainant of the offences detailed Annexure B; and
failed to notify
within seven days the complainant of convictions detailed in Annexure
is further alleged that the respondent: –
sentenced for offences which he had been convicted. Judge David sentenced
Mr Leane to a head sentence of four years and eight
months with a non-parole
period of two years.
2 Mr Leane self-reported that he:
(1) was a user of methamphetamines and cannabis;
(2) commenced use whilst at school;
(3) used methamphetamines for 3 to 4 years during his career as a nurse
whilst employed at Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH);
(4) built up a tolerance and required increased amounts of methamphetamines
for intoxication; and
(5) engaged in burglary and theft to fund his Methamphetamine use.
Tribunal was also referred in paragraph 7(c) of the Complaint to the
respondent’s written report to the Adelaide Magistrates
Court dated
5 August 2016.
In that report
the respondent acknowledged his consumption of methamphetamines for four years
prior to January 2016 and whilst employed
at the RAH.
Forbes told the Tribunal that Mr Leane’s registration had lapsed.
Mr Forbes submitted that Mr Leane’s registration
should be cancelled.
However the Tribunal expressed concern about proceeding with an unrepresented
party in the absence of up-to-date
reports from Mr Leane’s medical
practitioner psychologist and parole officer. It was agreed that the Tribunal
would adjourn
to 2 April for these reports.
the resumed hearing Mr Forbes tendered: –
Exhibit C1 Book
of Documents.
Report of Tessa Jarmyn.
Report Parole Board of SA dated 4 December 2018.
Report of Dr J Walsh dated 28 March 2019.
Report of Dr R McCubbin dated 21 March 2019.
Chronology.
page 11 of Exhibit C1 the Tribunal received a 30 page document annexure that is
entitled ‘Statement of Agreed Facts’.
document is significant for the extensive details of the criminal offending of
the respondent, the outcomes and that Mr Leane
acknowledges professional
misconduct. Moreover Mr Leane concedes that he had a duty of disclosure to AHPRA
of his criminal offences
and subsequent conviction. He had, in 2012, disclosed
prior convictions after prompting by AHPRA. Mr Forbes submitted that this
non-disclosure
is an aggravating feature of already serious misconduct. That Mr
Leane attended for duty at RAH under the influence of drugs is also
disturbing aspect. The public are entitled to expect nursing staff to present
for duty not under the influence of illegal
drugs such as
methylamphetamine.
Tribunal notes that Mr Leane was imprisoned for four years and eight months with
a non-parole period of two years. On 11 December
2018 Mr Leane was released
on conditional parole. The report of his community corrections officer dated 28
March 2019 has reported
satisfactory compliance by Mr Leane with his parole
conditions. Dr Walsh and Dr McCubbin have also reported positively on Mr
rehabilitation in the community.
Purpose of Disciplinary Proceedings.
purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public, maintain proper
professional standards and to assure the public
that proper standards are being
maintained. This assists in upholding public trust and confidence in the
profession.
Craig v Medical Board of South
Doyle CJ said:
The purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect
the public, not to punish a practitioner in the sense in which punishment is
administered pursuant to the criminal law. A disciplinary tribunal protects the
public by making orders which will prevent persons
who are unfit to practise
from practising, or by making orders which will secure the maintenance of proper
professional standards.
A disciplinary tribunal will also consider the
protection of the public, and of the relevant profession, by making orders which
assure the public that appropriate standards are being maintained within
the relevant
profession.
Tribunal is mindful that the imposition of disciplinary action may serve one or
all of the following purposes: –
practitioners who are unfit to practice from practising;
maintenance of professional standards;
assuring members
of the public and the profession that appropriate standards are being maintained
and that professional misconduct
(or unprofessional conduct) will not be
bringing home to
the practitioner the seriousness of the conduct;
deterring the
practitioner from any future departures from appropriate standards;
referring other
members of the profession who might be mindful to act in a similar way; and
restrictions on the practitioners right to practice so as to ensure that the
public is protected.
Leane admitted that: –
He was charged
and convicted of serious criminal offences including serious criminal trespass,
dishonestly taking property or dealing
with property without consent, possession
of firearm or using a firearm without a licence and failure to comply with bail
He failed to
inform the complainant when charged with offences.
He failed to
notify the complainant when convicted of offences.
At the time of
offending he was a heavy user of Methamphetamines including when working as an
employed nurse.
Leane admits that he engaged in professional misconduct.
Pharmacy Board of Australia v
... If a member of the profession commits a criminal
offence punishable by imprisonment, this reflects on the reputation of the
and may damage public confidence in it.
Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia v
at paragraph 16 the
Tribunal said:–
... needs to protect the profession and to maintain
public confidence by emphasising to the profession and to the public that this
form of misconduct is unacceptable and is to be dealt with firmly. It is our
view that it is necessary for the Tribunal to indicate
disapproval both on its
own behalf and on behalf of the profession.
disclosure of criminal conduct (including alleged conduct) is reflected by the
national law as it enables boards to obtain criminal
histories and that criminal
charges convictions of properly disclosed and as to whether a person is fit and
proper to hold registration.
Nursing and Midwifery Board v
the Tribunal stated:
... that the Respondent’s failure to notify the
Complainant, within seven days, of being charged with trafficking in a
substance is a serious aggravating feature of her professional
misconduct...
For the public to be protected and professional standards upheld it is
imperative that any health professional who is charged with
a criminal offence
notifies their relevant professional registration Board. Without such
notification the relevant professional Board
is not in the position to take
steps to protect the public and maintain professional
Mr Leane’s registration is cancelled he is still registered for the
purpose of these proceedings.
the Tribunal deliberations, the aspects to be taken into account in determining
an appropriate outcome are : –
To protect the
To protect the
public against further misconduct.
To maintain
public confidence in the profession and reinforce high professional
notification to AHPRA of offences and convictions.
Tribunal is also mindful of Mr Leane’s compliance with conditions of his
parole and the positive medical reports of Dr Walsh
and Dr McCubbin.
Tribunal was provided, by Mr Forbes, with Minutes of Order.
Tribunal was told that the proposed orders were agreed between the parties and
the Tribunal has satisfied itself that Mr Leane
was consulted in the preparation
of the Minutes of Order and supports the orders.
Tribunal finds that the respondent has engaged in professional misconduct. The
Tribunal orders that:
(1) The respondent’s registration be
cancelled for a period of two years and six months from the date of this
(2) The Respondent pay the complainant’s costs fixed the sum of
$1,500.00 and payable within 18 months from the date of the
or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may
apply to this judgment.
The onus remains on any person using material in the judgment to ensure that the
intended use of that material
does not breach any such order or provision.
