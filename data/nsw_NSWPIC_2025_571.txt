STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
8 October 2020 Ragini Singh (the claimant) was driving her motor vehicle on the
M5 Motorway towards Ingleburn. Another motor vehicle was attempting to
change lanes and collided with a Toyota Camry which resulted
in this vehicle
colliding with the barricade in the middle of the motorway. The claimant was
unable to stop her vehicle in time and
collided with the rear of the Toyota
claimant was injured and was transported to Liverpool Hospital where she was
diagnosed with a fractured right clavicle and a fracture
of the sternum.
Subsequently, due to a non-union and displacement of the clavicle, she underwent
internal fixation of the right clavicle
fracture on 28 October 2020. She then
underwent physiotherapy. The internal fracture ultimately healed.
insurer wholly admitted liability and conceded she sustained a non-threshold
was born in 1966 and will shortly be 59 years of age. At the time of the
accident and up until the present time, she is employed
as a librarian at the
Canterbury Bankstown library where she has been employed for over 22 years. She
eventually returned to her
full-time employment but had several months off work
and a further period of nine months, until she could resume her normal
insurer arranged for her to be examined on a medico-legal basis by Associate
Professor Ian Cameron and I refer to his report dated
17 May 2024. He has
provided a detailed report. He carried out a physical examination of the
claimant and viewed treating medical
reports and imaging reports. On page 4 of
his report, under the heading,” Diagnosis and Prognosis”, I note the
“In the high-speed motor vehicle crash on 8 October
2020, Mrs Singh had sustained a displaced fracture of her right clavicle
sternal fracture. Given the mechanism of injury, she would also have sustained
soft tissue injuries to other body parts, particularly
her cervical spine and
shoulder regions. Following internal fixation of the right clavicle fracture it
has healed in good position.
The sternal fracture has healed. Mrs Singh has some residual symptoms related
to the clavicular fracture. Mrs Singh has returned to
work and usual
activities.”
page 5 of his report, I note the following:
“Mrs Singh has
returned to her normal work role. She had significant period where she could not
follow normal duties. Based
on her description she took several months to return
to work and approximately 9 months to return to normal duties.”
Professor Cameron assessed the whole person impairment of the claimant to be 1%.
The claimant acknowledged she is not entitled
to damages for non-economic
the preliminary conference on 16 October 2025, I discussed with the claimant her
ability to carry out all the duties required of
her as a librarian. On occasions
she may have to lift boxes of books but does try to ensure there is not too much
of this activity.
She does exercise regularly and does yoga.
parties did engage in earlier discussions which resulted in the insurer
proposing to resolve the matter in the sum of $104,500
less statutory benefits
in the sum of $16,423.34. This results in a net settlement to the claimant in
the sum of $88,076.66.
insurer allowed a past loss of earnings from the date of the accident until
18 February 2021, at an allowance of $1,169.73 net per week, for a period of
20 weeks totalling $23,394.60. The insurer also allowed
past superannuation in
the sum of $2,573.41 and a buffer allowance of $4,000 to cover any additional
time off work she may have had.
Furthermore,
she stated but for the accident she would have successfully applied for a team
leader position with the library. She
stated she would have received an increase
of salary equating to a net weekly amount of $1,223.31. The insurer allowed for
the difference
of $196.16 between these two salary rates from 1 December 2020 to
31 August 2024 which totalled the sum of $38,358.60. An additional
allowance for
superannuation at 11% amounted to $4,219.45. Fox v Wood is $4,803. In summary,
the insurer made an allowance for past
economic loss in the sum of
$81,952.06.
relation to future economic loss, having regard to her age and the fact she has
reported some ongoing issues with her shoulder,
the insurer proposed a buffer of
$22,000 to account for any potential time off work, as well as considerations
relating to her failure
to obtain the team leader position. The total of both
past and future loss of earnings is $103,952.06 and the insurer rounded this
figure to the proposed sum of $104,500:
past economic
loss (including super) $77,149.06
tax withheld
future economic
loss $22,000
extra allowance
for FEL $547.94
Total $104,500
less statutory benefits totalling $16,423.34 results in a net settlement of
$88,076.66.
