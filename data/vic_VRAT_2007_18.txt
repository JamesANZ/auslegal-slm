TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS
AT MELBOURNE ON WEDNESDAY
19 DECEMBER 2007 AT
MR D. POULTON appeared on behalf of Racing Victoria Limited
MR D. FARRANDS appeared on behalf of the Applicants.
MR FARRANDS: If Your Honour pleases there's a proposed consent order.
We'd be grateful if Your Honour would - - -
HIS HONOUR: Yes in the matter of Symons v. Laxon is it?
MR FARRANDS: Yes, yes.
HIS HONOUR: Yes.
MR FARRANDS: Has Your Honour received this?
HIS HONOUR: Yes I have Mr Farrands thank you. Mr Poulton you
agree with the terms of - - -
MR POULTON: They are by consent yes Mr Chairman.
HIS HONOUR: All right well I'll order that the appeal be allowed. Just
before I formally announce it I just, as a matter of formality
only, but there
was a plea of guilty before the disciplinary board wasn't there technically?
Because I think there was. I don't
suppose it matters does it as long as it's
set aside it doesn't matter what happened there?
MR POULTON: I think that's correct. Any court has the jurisdiction to
acquit I think irrespective of the plea that's been put for
HIS HONOUR: All right well the appeal's allowed and why don't I order
that any conviction or finding of guilt and any penalty imposed
by the Racing
Appeals and Disciplinary Board on 24 September 2007 set aside?
MR FARRANDS: Yes thank you. We'd be content.
MR POULTON: That would be satisfactory.
HIS HONOUR: Yes and then in accordance with your third paragraph I'll
note that the costs of the appeal of the hearing below are
reserved pending the
determination by the Tribunal on a date to be fixed. I presume the parties are
discussing that are they?
MR FARRANDS: Yes Your Honour. We've seen to sort that out.
HIS HONOUR: Well you can mention that at any time if you need to.
MR FARRANDS: Thank you sir.
HIS HONOUR: All right well the orders then are, (1) The appeal is
allowed, (2) Any conviction or finding of guilt and any penalty
imposed by the
Racing Appeals and Disciplinary Board on 24 September 2004 is set
aside, (3) The costs of the appeal in the hearing
below are reserved pending the
determination by the Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
MR FARRANDS: Thank you Your Honour. Would Your Honour usually have
those brought up to Your Honour for authentication or how would
MR POULTON: I think the usual practice is simply that the Tribunal - - -
HIS HONOUR: The record's transcribed.
MR POULTON: The Tribunal simply works off the transcript and there isn't
as such an order that needs to be authenticated.
HIS HONOUR: No that's right.
MR POULTON: In the informal jurisdiction which we reside.
HIS HONOUR: Exactly. Mr Higgins is here. He will on behalf of
Racing Victoria Ltd he will receive a copy of the transcript and
that will be
acted upon.
MR FARRANDS: Thank you Your Honour, we contend that.
MR POULTON: Yes thank you.
HIS HONOUR: All right thank you Mr Poulton and Mr Farrand.
