Sentencing Snapshot 276: Sentencing Trends for Arson in the Higher Courts
of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of arson

A person who intentionally and without lawful excuse destroys or damages any
property belonging to another by setting it on fire is
guilty of arson. A person
is deemed to have destroyed or damaged the property intentionally if it was the
person's purpose to do
so or if the person was aware that their conduct was more
likely than not to result in the damage or destruction of the

This Snapshot focuses on cases where arson was the principal offence, that
is, cases where arson was the offence that received the

Arson was the principal offence in 1.7% of cases sentenced in the higher
courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous
years because the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the
combined effect of:
guilty pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system; and
the experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on
prisoners and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 145 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of arson.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
arson by financial year. There were 30 people sentenced
for this offence in
2021-22, up from 25 in the previous year. The number of people sentenced was
highest in 2018-19 (31 people) and
lowest in 2020-21 (25 people).

terms ranged from 11
while the median length
of imprisonment was 2 years and 6 months (meaning that half of the imprisonment

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an immediate
imprisonment term of less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole
period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court
has the discretion to fix a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
or more, the court must impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the
court fixes a non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before
becoming eligible for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the
person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 120 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for arson, 90 (75.0%)
were eligible to have a non-parole period
Of those 90 people, 65
were given a non-parole period

periods were below 2 years
and 2 months and half were above).
The most common range of non-parole periods was 2 to less than 3 years (22

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for arson face multiple
charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks at the
of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of arson.
Figure 8 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
arson by the total number of sentenced offences per person.
The number of
sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 25, and the median was 2
offences. There were 41 people (28.3%) sentenced
for the single offence of
arson. The average number of offences per person was 3.4.
