Mr. Fleming applied to their Honors for a rule to shew cause why a prohibition should not issue to stay farther proceedings
in the Court of Requests, at New Norfolk, under the following circumstances - In the township of New Norfolk there is a water act,
to regulate the supply of water to the inhabitants. During Mr. Burnett's absence in England, Mrs. Burnett occupied a house in
the township, which was supplied with water under the regulations of the act, and for which she was rated 7s. 9d. per quarter. Upon
Mr. Burnett's return he considered the rate too high, because the water was not conveyed directly from the reservoir. He therefore
refused to pay the rate; and in June last, Mr. Joseph Hall, the town surveyor, filed a plaint in the Court of Requests against Mr.
Burnett for 7s 9d.; being a quarter's "rent" for the water. The case came on for hearing before Mr. Mason, Deputy Commissioner
of the Court of Requests, and one of the persons appointed to work out the provisions of the water act at New Norfolk. Mr. Burnett,
by his agent Mr. Morgan, objected to the proceeding; - first, that Mr. Hall had no right to sue in his own name; and secondly, even
if he had, he could not do so without the express consent of the Attorney General. Mr. Mason, however, decided for the plaintiff,
and it was to restrain further proceedings that the present application was made. The learned Counsel said, he would waive another
objection, as it was one rather of principle than law; he alluded to the Deputy Commissioner being one of the persons appointed to
act, with the Town Surveyor, in the distribution of the water and the imposition of the rate under the
; but, on the other grounds he stated, he considered that he was entitled at least to a rule
. The learned counsel then referred to the New Norfolk
, and to the new Court of Requests Act, quoting several clauses in support of his motion. Rule granted.

, 1 December 1843
The Solicitor General shewed cause against a rule
, recently granted on the application of Mr. Fleming, to restrain proceedings in a case before the Court of Requests at New Norfolk,
arising out of an application to Mr. Burnett for 7s. 6d., one quarter's rent for water. This payment was refused, on the ground
of overcharge; and an action to recover, under the
; was brought by Mr. Joseph Hall, Town Surveyor. It was argued, when the rule was granted, that the Surveyor could not sue in his
own name; and that, even if he could, he must have the consent of the Attorney General. The Solicitor-General now submitted to the
prohibition, leaving the question of costs. This was not acceded to, and the Court took time to consider.
