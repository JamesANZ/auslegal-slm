INTRODUCTION
1 The applicant has made an application to the Tribunal
disputing a decision made by the Motor Accidents Insurance Board (“the
Board”) to pay a disability allowance to him subsequent to February 2014
after he had been absent from Australia for a period
of time. The applicant
asserts that he provided the Board with the necessary certification of
incapacity from his general practitioner
however the Board failed to recommence
making payment of the disability allowance. This matter was heard with the
Board represented
by counsel and the applicant appearing in person.
DETERMINATION
2 Formal evidence was not taken before the Tribunal, however in
the course of a general outline as to his claim given by the applicant,
assertions by him as to fact were either accepted by the Board or were resolved
by agreement between the parties or to such extent
that the Tribunal was able to
conclude as to those facts. The Tribunal sought specific detail as to material
facts from the applicant
and once again these facts were able to be determined
upon hearing from the applicant and counsel for the Board.
conclusion of submissions the Tribunal was able to make the following findings
• The applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident
on 21 April 2009 and consequently an application for benefits was accepted
the Board and the applicant has been paid scheduled benefits including a
disability allowance. At the conclusion of the initial
2 year entitlement to
the payment of a disability allowance which expired on 21 April 2011, the
applicant was granted an entitlement
to a further 3 year period which would
conclude on 21 April 2014.
• Pursuant to the Motor Accidents
(Liabilities and Compensation) Regulations 2010 (“the Regulations”)
the applicant’s
entitlement to receive disability payments would expire at
the expiration of 260 weeks (5 years) from the date of the motor vehicle
• The applicant left Australia on or about 1 October 2012,
resided with family in Egypt and returned to Australia on or about
26 February
• The applicant provided a medical certificate as to incapacity
prior to leaving Australia and he was paid a disability allowance
from 1 October
2012 up until the end of December 2012, a period of some 91
• Regulation 6(1)(b) of the Regulations provides that a
disability allowance is not payable for any period while the injured
outside the Commonwealth.
• Upon return to Australia, the applicant
sought a resumption of his payment of a disability allowance and provided the
with a medical certificate in support of ongoing
incapacity.
• The Board noted that the applicant had been paid a
disability allowance for some 91 days without lawful entitlement pursuant
Regulations, and noting that the period from 26 February 2014 when the applicant
sought a resumption of payments to 21 April
2014 when his entitlement would
cease was a period of 53 days, the Board refused to reinstate payment to the
applicant but rather
set-off his entitlement for that period against what it
classified as a debt concerning the previous payment without lawful
4 The applicant explained in some detail that he had left
Australia and travelled to Egypt where his family resided upon medical advice
that this would assist his mental health status which had deteriorated in the
period leading up to October 2012. He stated that
his original intent was to
travel for a short period of time; however he became stranded due to the civil
unrest that broke out in
Egypt and he was unable to leave for many months and so
was out of Australia for a protracted period of time. He submits that this
period of some 16 months when he was not paid the disability allowance by the
Board, ought to be paid at this time, on the basis,
I infer, that he has an
entitlement for the actual payment of a disability allowance for a period of 5
years and this has not yet
occurred in his case.
5 I am unable to identify
within the legislation any indication that it is intended that a person
otherwise entitled to a disability
allowance ought to receive 5 years’ in
total of such payments. The legislation appears clear that an entitlement
strictly 5 years from the date of the motor vehicle accident and that
any period within that 5 years in which a payment is not made
upon a proper
lawful basis does not mean that such periods are added to the 5 year limitation
6 I gather from the submissions made that the Board were unaware that
the applicant had in fact left the country in October 2012,
and it was upon this
basis that payments continued until December 2012.
7 It was clear upon
submissions that the Board made payments to the applicant during the period
October 2012 to December 2012 unaware
of the fact that the applicant had left
Australia. Payments made for that period were therefore without legal authority
legislation. On the face of it this was a mistake of fact or mistake
of fact and law on the Board’s behalf but the distinction
between rights
of recovery of money paid as a result of a mistake of fact as compared to a
mistake of law have now (save for certain
limitations) been removed by the High
Court in its decision in David Securities Pty Ltd & Ors v Commonwealth of
[1992] HCA 48
[1992] 175 CLR 353.
In applying this judgment in Bingley v MAIB a
decision of the Motor Accidents Compensation Tribunal of 17 October 1996 it was
“As was held in David (supra), a payer is primarily entitled to
recover monies paid under a mistake if it appears that the monies
were paid in a
mistaken belief by the payer that he was under a legal obligation to pay them or
that the payee was legally entitled
to payment. However, it is a defence to a
claim to recover money paid under a mistake if the payee has adversely changed
in position
in reliance on the payment or that a representation has been made
which enables the defence of estoppel to be pleaded.”
8 In that case
the Tribunal was considering the overpayment of a disability allowance and
action taken by the Board to suspend the
payment until such overpayment had been
recovered and the Tribunal concluded:
“As a result the Board is
entitled to suspend payment of the continuation of the disability allowance to
the application until
the total amount of the overpayment is recouped by the
9 I accept that the Board, as a matter of law, were entitled to
withhold payment of the disability allowance payment to the applicant
period from February 2014 to April 2014 as a set off to its right of restitution
in respect of the payment made by mistake
in the period October 2012 to December
10 The Tribunal also determines that as at 21 April 2014 the
applicant’s statutory entitlement to receive a disability payment
the period provided by the Regulations in which such payment might be made had
expired. The legislation provides no basis
upon which this period might be
11 The application is dismissed.
