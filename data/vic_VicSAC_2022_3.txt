this report
report addresses a requirement in the
Corrections Act 1986
(Vic) that:
[f]or each financial year commencing on or after 1 July 2016, the Sentencing
Advisory Council must report for that year the number
of persons convicted
during that year of a serious offence committed while subject to a community
correction order.
This report identifies the number of people sentenced in 2020–21 for a
serious offence committed while the person was serving
a community correction
order (CCO). It updates
Serious Offending by People Serving a Community
Correction Order: 2019–20
This is the Council’s fifth report on serious offending by people
serving a CCO.
The Council has also
published reports on how courts use
This report examines some important issues relating to people sentenced for a
serious offence committed while serving a CCO, including:
the prevalence
of different types of serious offences committed by people serving a CCO;
the total number
of people sentenced in 2020–21 for committing a serious offence; and
the time between
when people commenced a CCO and when they committed a serious offence.
2. Community correction orders in Victoria
The CCO is a non-custodial
sentence available in the Victorian higher courts (the County and Supreme
Courts) and Magistrates’
Court. It is not available in the
Children’s Court.
The purpose of the CCO is to ‘provide a community-based sentence that
may be used for a wide range of offending behaviours while
having regard to and
addressing the circumstances of the
A court may only impose a CCO if:
the offender has
been convicted or found guilty of an offence punishable by more than five
penalty units; and
the court has
received a pre-sentence report (if required) and has had regard to any
recommendations, information or matters identified
in the pre-sentence report;
• the offender consents to the
Sentencing Act 1991
(Vic), a CCO is considered more severe
than an adjourned undertaking or a fine but less severe than a custodial
sentence. In practice,
the severity of a CCO varies according to the conditions
and length of the specific CCO imposed.
Changes to the CCO
The CCO became available to the courts on 16 January
Since its introduction, the
CCO has been affected by a number of amendments to the
Sentencing Act 1991
• the courts were encouraged in September 2014 to use a CCO in place of
a suspended sentence;
• initially, the maximum length of a CCO that could be imposed in the
higher courts was equal to the maximum term of imprisonment
available for the
but in March 2017 the
maximum length of a CCO was set at five years in respect of one, or more than
one, offence in a case;
• initially, the maximum term of imprisonment that could be combined
with a CCO (a ‘combined order’) was set at
but it was increased to
two years in September 2014
reduced to one year in March
• the courts’ use of CCOs was limited in March 2017 for two
classes of serious offences, described as Category 1 offences
and Category 2
courts must impose a custodial order when sentencing Category 1 offences (for
example, murder or rape). The courts are prohibited
from imposing a combined
order for Category 1 offences; and
similarly, the courts must impose a custodial order for Category 2
offences (for example, manslaughter or culpable driving causing
death) unless
there are special reasons.
there are special reasons, a CCO or combined order remains available as a
sentencing option.
In addition to these legislative changes, the Victorian Court of
Appeal’s first guideline judgment offered guidance to the courts
purposes, strengths and limitations of the
Conditions of a CCO
All CCOs have a set of
mandatory (core)
, including that the offender does not reoffend.
The court must also attach at least one
discretionary condition
CCO for all or part of the duration of the order.
Mandatory conditions
(attached to all CCOs) include requiring the
offender to:
Victoria without permission
report to a
community corrections centre
comply with
written directions from the Secretary to the Department of Justice and Community
Discretionary conditions
include requiring the
offender to:
medical treatment or other rehabilitation
licensed premises (such as a hotel, club or restaurant)
complete unpaid
community work up to a total of 600 hours
be supervised,
monitored and managed by a corrections worker
abstain from
live (or not
live) at a specified address

electronic monitoring
be monitored and
reviewed by the court to ensure compliance with the order
– a sum of money that may be given up wholly or partly if the offender
fails to comply with any conditions imposed
Length of a CCO
The maximum length of a CCO imposed on a single
offence is five years in the higher
and two years in the
Magistrates’ Court.
A CCO may be imposed on multiple offences, provided the offences ‘are
founded on the same facts or form or are part of a series
of offences of the
same or a similar
character’.
When a CCO is imposed on multiple offences in the higher courts, the maximum
length of the CCO remains five years. In the Magistrates’
maximum length is four years in relation to two offences and five years in
relation to three or more
Sentences in addition to a CCO
A court may impose a
or a sentence of
imprisonment in addition to a
If a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment in addition to a CCO, the term
of imprisonment must not exceed one
Contravention of a CCO
Contravention (breach) of a CCO without a reasonable
excuse is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of three months’
imprisonment.
If a person contravenes their CCO, either through committing a new offence or
through failing to comply with another condition of
the order, they face a
number of potential consequences.
If the person is found guilty of the offence of contravention of a CCO, the
court must decide how to deal with the original CCO. If
the contravention is due
to new offending, the offender is also sentenced for the new offence or
3. Serious offences
This report identifies
the number of serious offences committed by people serving a CCO. Serious
• serious violent
such as armed robbery,
aggravated burglary, arson causing death and false imprisonment; conspiracies,
attempts and incitements of
these offences; and similar offences committed in
Victoria or elsewhere that contain elements of these offences; and
• sexual offences
as rape, sexual assault and sexual penetration of a child aged under 16.

serious offence
changed in 2020–21 with the
inclusion of the offence of homicide by
Specific information is required in the source data to determine whether an
offence is serious. However, this information was not
available for a small
number of offence types. These include burglary, which, if sexually motivated,
falls within the definition
of a serious offence. They also include offences
relating to the commission of an indictable offence where the underlying
offence is not specified. In these instances, the offence has been
classified as not serious and therefore has been excluded from
the analysis.
4. Meaning of the term convicted
Corrections Act
(Vic) uses the term
in relation to the serious
offences committed by people on CCOs that the Council must report on. Two
meanings of the term are relevant.
One is a finding of guilt made by a court
against a person; the other is a recording made by a court following a finding
In this report,
is defined as a finding of guilt made by a
court. This definition excludes findings at special hearings under the
(Mental Impairment and Unfitness to Be Tried) Act 1997
(Vic), such as being
found not guilty due to mental impairment or receiving qualified findings of
The report also excludes
offences that are dealt with in the Magistrates’ Court using a
court-ordered diversion. Court-ordered
diversions do not result in a formal
finding of guilt even though the person must take responsibility for the offence
before a diversion
The date of conviction is required for a count of convicted persons within a
given period. However, the date of conviction was not
available in the data used
for this report. The closest available date to the date of conviction is the
date of sentence. Therefore,
the date of sentence is used in this report as a
proxy for the date of conviction.
5. Reference period
The reference period for
this report is 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. This period relates to the date on

offence was
. The date on which an offence was committed is
irrelevant to the Council’s reporting obligation, which only requires that
relevant offence was committed by a person who:
was serving a
CCO at the time; and
was convicted
(sentenced) in the reference period.
Some serious offences sentenced
in the reference period may have been committed prior to the reference period.
There is always some
delay between the commission of an offence and the sentence
for that offence. For example, a person who committed a serious offence
May 2019 while serving a CCO may not have been sentenced for the serious offence
until 1 July 2020. The Council’s last
report also noted that court
operations during the 2019–20 financial year were significantly affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The analysis in this
report measures the overlap between two populations (see Figure 1):

The CCO offender population comprises all people
who served a CCO from the introduction of the order on 16 January 2012 to the
of the reference period on 30 June 2021. If the one person received two or
more CCOs during that time, they would be counted once
within the CCO offender
population.

Serious offence population
The number of people in the CCO offender population is 68,644. This number
includes people who may have received two or more CCOs.
The serious offence population comprises all proven charges of a serious
offence committed by any person and sentenced in the Magistrates’
in the higher courts from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. The number of people in
the serious offence population is 2,884,
and they committed 4,530 proven charges
of a serious offence.
The number of people sentenced for serious offending (and the number of
proven charges) in 2020–21 was the lowest since 2016–17,
Council began annually reporting on serious offending by people serving a CCO.

the figures in
2020–21 represent a 13.0% decrease in people sentenced for serious
offences and a 17.5% decrease in proven charges
of serious offending.
Data limitations
There are a number of limitations in the data used
for this analysis.
Due to data limitations, serious offences have been
excluded if the offence was:
outside Victoria (it is possible for a person serving a CCO to depart Victoria
and commit a serious offence in another jurisdiction);
committed while
the person was serving a CCO but no link was established between the serious
offence population and the CCO offender
population; and/or
insufficiently
described in the source data (for example, burglary is not classed as a serious
offence even though it falls within
the definition of a serious offence in
certain circumstances).
Each of these exclusions may result in an
undercount of the number of people who committed a serious offence while serving
Due to data limitations, serious offences have been
included if:
the convictions
for the offences were subsequently quashed by an appellate court;
offenders had
proceedings initiated against them for contravention of a CCO and were awaiting
a court decision for the contravention
when they committed their serious offence
even though they may not necessarily have been under active supervision;
the relevant CCO
was cancelled before the serious offence was committed, but the cancellation
date was not available in the source
data at the time of
Each of these inclusions may result in an overcount of the
number of people who committed a serious offence while serving a CCO.
7. All people serving a CCO
Figure 2 shows the number
of people who received a CCO each financial year from 2011–12 to
2020–21, based on the date
of sentence. It also shows whether the person
had previously received a CCO. A total of 68,644 people received a CCO for the
time between 16 January 2012 and 30 June 2021 (see the lower part of each
bar in Figure 2). A subset of these people (45,807 of 68,644
people or 66.7%)
received a second or subsequent CCO during a different financial year between 16
January 2012 and 30 June 2021 (see
the upper part of each bar in Figure 2). Some
of these 45,807 people were counted more than once as they may have received a
CCO over multiple years. The number of
unique individuals
received a CCO over multiple years was 28,468 people or 41.5% of the overall
number of 68,644 people.
The total number of people who received a CCO plateaued in the four years to
30 June 2019 (at around 15,000 people each year) before
markedly decreasing in
the next two years to just over 9,000 people in 2020–21. As noted
previously, the downward trend in
the last two years is most likely due to
COVID-19 restrictions leading to a reduction in the number of criminal matters
the courts.
Figure 2 also shows a steady increase in the proportion of people who
received a second or subsequent CCO each year since the order
was introduced on
16 January 2012. In 2012–13, 8.5% of people were on their second or
subsequent CCO (685 of 8,092 people).
The percentage of people who received a
second or subsequent CCO continued to increase each year, such that by
2020–21, 63.1%
of people who received a CCO in that year were on their
second or subsequent CCO. The increase in the percentage of people who received
a second or subsequent CCO each year is not entirely unexpected, as people have
a greater chance of accumulating more CCOs the longer
this sentencing option is
available to the courts.

Of the 68,644 people who

sentenced in 2020–21 for a
serious offence committed while serving a CCO

Dates on which CCOs commenced varied widely for people sentenced in
2020–21 for a serious offence committed while serving a
CCO, ranging from
22 January 2015 to 6 May 2021. However, as Figure 4 shows, the vast majority of
CCOs (97.0%) commenced between
2017–18 and 2020–21.

number of people sentenced in 2020–21 was the lowest since 2016–17
(see Figure 5). Again, the decrease since 2019–20
was most likely due to
continuing COVID-19 restrictions and the limits these placed on court operations
in the two most recent years.

serving a CCO, by financial year

Rate of CCO contravention by serious offending
It is not possible to calculate an accurate rate of
CCO contravention by serious offending using the reference period that the
is required to report on. This is because the reference period is:
based on the
date of sentence for a serious offence, which results in non-standardised
follow-up periods; and
restricted to a
single financial year, meaning serious offending sentenced outside the reference
period is excluded.
This report adopts the methodology from the four
previous reports in this series to estimate a proxy rate of CCO contravention by
serious offending: it only considers CCOs imposed in the three years to the end
of the reference period (i.e. 1 July 2018 to 30 June
2021). A total of 27,175
people received a CCO over the three-year period; of these, 428 were sentenced
in 2020–21 for a serious
offence committed while serving a CCO.
The estimated rate of CCO contravention by serious offending for
2020–21 is 1.6%, which remains very similar to the trend in
the previous
four years (see Figure 6).
of people sentenced for a serious offence committed while
serving a CCO remained stable each year, despite a fall in the
people within the underlying population since 2019–20 (see Figure 5). One
reason for the stability in these proportions
may be the fall in the number of
people sentenced for committing a serious offence coinciding with the fall in
the number of people
being placed on a CCO (see Figure 2, page 8). Both groups
may have been similarly affected by the COVID-19 restrictions that impacted
court operations in 2019–20 and 2020–21.
Figure 6: Estimated rate of CCO contravention by serious offending, by
financial year of sentence for serious offence
Financial year of sentence
It is important to note that these percentages most likely underestimate the
true rates of CCO contravention by serious offending.
Some people who committed
a serious offence while serving a CCO imposed in the three-year period may have
been sentenced either before
or after 2020–21.

Three serious offences sentenced in 2020–21 stand out from the most
common serious offences committed by people serving a CCO:
make threat to
kill (237 charges);
make threat to
inflict serious injury (126 charges); and
burglary (92 charges).
These three serious offences were also the
most common serious offences from 2016–17 to 2019–20 for people
sentenced for
a serious offence committed while serving a
Also of note for these
three serious offences is that the number of sentenced charges was lowest in
2020–21, most likely reflecting
the effect of COVID-19 on court
operations. The number of sentenced charges of make threat to kill declined by
15.4% in 2020–21
compared to the number of sentenced charges in
2019–20; likewise, make threat to inflict serious injury declined by
and aggravated burglary declined by 27.6%.
The most common serious sexual offences sentenced in 2020–21 were
sexual assault (12 charges) and engage in sexual activity
in the presence of a
child aged under 16 (eight charges). The number of sentenced charges of sexual
assault peaked in 2017–18
and 2018–19 (26 charges each) but declined
in subsequent years. The number of sentenced charges of engage in sexual
in the presence of a child aged under 16 hovered between zero and three
charges per year from 2016–17 to 2019–20, before
increasing to eight
charges in 2020–21; however, it remains too early to detect whether this
is the start of a trend for this
In addition, the courts sentenced two charges of
manslaughter,
one charge of
and one charge of rape by
compelling sexual penetration
committed by people serving a CCO. No people were sentenced in 2020–21 for
an offence of murder committed while serving a CCO.
Overall, the number of
sentenced charges of murder, manslaughter, rape and rape by compelling sexual
penetration committed by people
serving a CCO represented:
0.0% of all
charges of murder sentenced in 2020–21;
10.5% of all
charges of manslaughter sentenced in 2020–21;
2.9% of all
charges of rape sentenced in 2020–21; and
100% of all
charges of rape by compelling sexual penetration sentenced in 2020–21;
however, only one charge of this offence
was sentenced during the financial
Caution should be used when comparing yearly changes in the
percentage of people sentenced for murder, manslaughter or rape offences
committed while serving a CCO. The small

in large fluctuations in
. This is despite the number of people
or sentenced charges remaining stable over the five financial years to
2020–21. Consequently,
a simple comparison of the change in percentage
each year may be misleading.
The number and percentage of sentenced charges of murder committed by people
serving a CCO were at their lowest in 2020–21 (zero
charges and 0.0% of
all charges of murder sentenced that year) compared to the last four years. The
number and percentage of sentenced
charges of murder committed by people serving
a CCO were at their highest during 2017–18 (four charges representing
all sentenced charges of murder that
The number of sentenced charges of manslaughter committed by people serving a
CCO remained relatively consistent in the last five
years, ranging from one
sentenced charge in
to two sentenced
charges in each subsequent year,
including 2020–21. The percentage of sentenced charges of manslaughter
committed by people serving a CCO was 10.5% in 2020–21.
This was midway
between the lowest percentage (7.7% in
and the highest
percentage (13.3% in both
The number of sentenced charges of rape committed by people serving a CCO was
lowest in 2020–21 (one charge) compared to the
previous four years. The
lowest percentage of sentenced charges of rape committed by people serving a CCO
was in 2017–18 (1.9%),
which was only slightly lower than the percentage in 2020–21 (2.9%). The
highest number and percentage of sentenced charges
of rape committed by people
serving a CCO were in 2018–19 (eight sentenced charges representing 7.8%
of all charges of rape
sentenced that year) with six of the eight sentenced
charges being committed by a single
The 2020–21 financial year was also the first time that a sentence was

10. Gender and age of people sentenced for committing a serious
offence while serving a CCO
A total of 457 males
(94.6% of people) and 26 females (5.4% of people) were sentenced in
2020–21 for a serious offence committed
while serving a CCO. This is
consistent with patterns observed in the four previous
which also found that
the majority (90% or more) of people sentenced for a serious offence committed
while serving a CCO were male.
The majority of people sentenced for a serious offence committed while
serving a CCO were aged between 18 and 44 when their CCO was
imposed. This age
group received 90.7% of the CCOs imposed on people who were subsequently
sentenced for a serious offence committed
while serving that same CCO.
Two-thirds of this group were aged under 35 when their CCO was imposed (66.6%)
(see Figure 8).
People sentenced for a serious offence committed while serving a CCO had a
median age of 30 when their CCO was imposed. People’s
age ranged from 18
to 78 when their CCO was imposed.
As Figure 8 shows, the most prevalent age group was 25 to 34 (35.7%), and the
least prevalent age group was 55 and over (0.9%). The
patterns in Figure 8 are
almost identical to the patterns observed in the four previous

11. CCOs combined with imprisonment
In 2020–21, 43.9%
of people sentenced for a serious offence committed while serving a CCO (212 of
483 people) were on a CCO
combined with imprisonment (a ‘combined
order’). This percentage is higher than the percentage in the previous
four years,
although it appears that the rate of increase is slowing down. The
percentage for each year has steadily trended upwards since 2016–17
Figure 9). Large changes in the percentage of people serving a combined order
seem to occur every two years, with a relatively
large increase in percentage in
2017–18 and 2019–20 compared to the previous year. It remains to be
seen whether another
large increase will occur in 2021–22.
While there is no clear single cause, drivers of the trend in Figure 9 may be
a combination of changes to legislation, sentencing
practices, offending
profiles and/or the unique criminal history and prospects of rehabilitation for
offenders sentenced in any given
year. Restrictions on court operations during
2020–21 due to COVID-19 may have also led to a slowdown in the growth of
for serious offending committed by people serving a combined
As noted in the previous
other factors that could
be contributing to the trends in Figure 9 may include:
the growing
percentage of people who received a second or subsequent CCO in recent years
(see Figure 2), peaking at 63.1% in 2020–21.
It is possible that people
serving a second or subsequent CCO may be more likely to be placed on a combined
order to reflect the
court’s view that repeat offending may require a more
severe sentence than a standalone CCO; and
• the use of
‘time served’ prison
– sentences of
imprisonment equal to the time spent on remand – followed by a CCO when
people were released. The greater
number of people serving a CCO after a time
served prison sentence may consequently increase the likelihood that those who
a serious offence while serving a CCO may be from this cohort.
The remaining 56.1% (271 people) sentenced in 2020–21 for a serious
offence committed while serving a CCO contravened a CCO
combined with imprisonment.

12. Time to first serious offence
The median time between
the CCO commencing and the commission of the earliest serious offence was 139
days (approximately 4.6 months)
for people sentenced in 2020–21 for a
serious offence committed while serving a CCO. This is similar to the median

found that the median time ranged from 131 days in
to 166 days in

counted only once in this section. In these
instances, their inclusion would be
based on the shortest amount of time between the CCO commencing and the
commission of the serious
The maximum time between a CCO commencing and the commission of the earliest
serious offence was 1,343 days (approximately three years
and eight months) for
people sentenced in 2020–21 for a serious offence committed while serving
a CCO. This is relatively similar
to the results in 2017–18 and
2019–20 (1,368 days
respectively). The
maximum time between a CCO commencing and the commission of the earliest serious
offence ranged from 881 days
to 1,455 days in
As Figure 10 shows, the majority (59.8%) of people sentenced in 2020–21
committed their first serious offence within six months
of their CCO commencing,
and 89.4% committed their first serious offence within the first year of their
CCO commencing. In general,
the amount of time taken by people sentenced in
2020–21 to commit their earliest serious offence after commencing a CCO
relatively similar to the amount of time taken by people sentenced in

13. Summary
Of the 68,644 people who
received a CCO between 16 January 2012 and 30 June 2021, 483 were sentenced in
2020–21 for a serious
offence committed while serving a CCO. This was the
lowest number of people sentenced for a serious offence committed while serving
a CCO in the five years to 30 June 2021. The 483 people sentenced in
2020–21 also represented a 17.3% decrease compared to
the 584 people
sentenced in 2019–20.
The lower number of people sentenced for a serious offence committed while
serving a CCO may be related to a decrease in the overall
number of unique
individuals sentenced in 2020–21 for committing serious offences (2,884
people and 4,530 charges). This number
of people and sentenced charges of
serious offending were the lowest in the five years to 30 June 2021. The
number of people
sentenced in 2020–21 for committing serious
offences represented a 13.0% decrease compared to 2019–20 (3,316 people),
number of sentenced charges
of serious offending in 2020–21
represented a 17.5% decrease compared to 2019–20 (5,488 charges). If fewer
people were
sentenced for serious offences overall, then it stands to reason
that the number of people sentenced for serious offences committed
while serving
a CCO would also decrease. The number of people sentenced for serious offending,
or placed on a CCO, may have been
affected by changes in legislation and
sentencing practices, as well as events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the
resulting restrictions
placed on court operations. This may have subsequently
affected the results in this report.
The estimated rate of CCO contravention by serious offending remained
relatively steady at 1.6% to 1.7% over the five financial years
to 30 June 2021.
As previously discussed, this proxy rate is likely to underestimate the true
rate of CCO contravention by serious
offending. Interestingly, the estimated
rate remained at similar levels for the time periods before and after COVID-19
restrictions
were implemented. One possible reason may be that the number of
people sentenced for a serious offence and the number of people given
affected to a similar degree by COVID-19 restrictions, such that the estimated
rate of CCO contravention remained relatively
stable on an annual basis.
There was a continued upward trend in the proportion of people who were
sentenced for a serious offence committed while serving a
CCO combined with
imprisonment (a ‘combined order’), although this trend may be
starting to slow down. The percentage
rose from 17.3% in 2016–17 to 43.9%
in 2020–21, although the increase between the percentage in 2019–20
and 2020–21 was relatively small compared to the increase in
previous years.
Despite the estimated rate of CCO contravention remaining relatively low at
1.6%, it is apparent that a sizeable proportion of people
were sentenced for a
serious offence committed while serving a CCO as part of a combined order. While
the reasons for the upward
trend remain open to speculation, a contributing
factor may be the increase in the use of combined orders in recent years,
the use of ‘time served’ prison sentences combined with a
CCO. It may be that the greater number of people serving a
CCO as part of a
combined order makes it more likely that people who committed a serious offence
while serving a CCO were doing so
as part of a combined order instead of as a
standalone CCO. An alternative theory is that people who were on a combined
have received a custodial sentence due to the nature of the offending
or had a more concerning criminal history, both of which may
elevate their
likelihood of reoffending compared to people who were given a standalone
Overall, people were sentenced in 2020–21 for 640 charges of a serious
offence committed while serving a CCO. This represents
a 22.9% decrease compared
to the number of sentenced charges in 2019–20 (830 charges); it was also
the lowest number of sentenced
charges in the five years to 30 June 2021.
The three most common serious offences for people sentenced in 2020–21
for a serious offence committed while serving a CCO remained
consistent with
those in the previous four years. They included make threat to kill (237
charges), make threat to inflict serious
injury (126 charges) and aggravated
burglary (92 charges). The most common serious sexual offences sentenced in
2020–21 included
sexual assault (12 charges) and engage in sexual activity
in the presence of a child aged under 16 (eight charges).
In addition, the courts sentenced two charges of manslaughter, one charge of
rape and one charge of rape by compelling sexual penetration.
No charges of
murder sentenced in 2020–21 were committed by people serving a CCO.
For people sentenced in 2020–21, the median time between a CCO
commencing and the commission of their earliest serious offence
was 139 days.
The median amount of time between a CCO commencing and the commission of the
earliest serious offence ranged from 131
days for people sentenced in
2019–20 to 166 days for people sentenced in 2017–18. Regardless of
when they were sentenced,
almost all people who were sentenced for a serious
offence committed while serving a CCO had committed their earliest serious
within 30 months of their CCO commencing.

to the two sentenced charges of manslaughter are as follows:
A manslaughter
was committed just over one month into a nine-month CCO. The original CCO was
given for several drug possession offences,
alongside weapons and ammunition
A manslaughter
was committed six months after the start of a 12-month CCO. The original CCO,
which was combined with imprisonment,
was for a variety of offences including
assault, property damage, theft, weapons and traffic offences.
. A rape was committed nearly
two months into an 18-month CCO. The original CCO was for persistent
contravention of a family violence
intervention order or safety notice.
. A rape by compelling sexual
penetration was committed 14-months into a 24-month CCO (and just over two
months after the original
CCO was varied as a result of a separate
contravention). The original CCO was for offences of attempt to procure sexual
penetration
by fraud, carrying on a business as a sex work provider and living
on the earnings of sex work without a licence, drug possession
and breach of
bail conditions.
