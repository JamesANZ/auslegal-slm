(Cth) makes it an offence, except in very limited circumstances, to
publish an account of proceedings that identify persons, associated
persons, or
witnesses involved in family law proceedings.
August 2024, I delivered reasons for
("Reasons") in respect of
financial proceedings between the applicant wife, the respondent husband, and
the second respondent, the
husband's mother, [Mrs Wither Senior]. In the
Reasons, I observed that the proceedings had been complicated by the question as
whether the husband owed a debt to Mrs Wither Senior and the wife's
application to set aside a 2014 and 2017 Acknowledgment of Debt
and Irrevocable
Authority executed by the husband and two 2019 Demands executed by Mrs Wither
Senior, pursuant to
section 106B
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) ("the
found that it was appropriate to exercise discretion to set aside the
transactions in accordance with the wife's
application.
I found that: (1) the
net property and superannuation entitlements of the husband and the wife
amounted to $1,831,136;
light of the property of the parties', it was just and equitable to make an
order by way of alteration of their property
(3) an assessment of
contributions favoured the husband, and his contributions should be assessed at
65% and the wife's contributions
assessed at
and (4) an assessment pursuant
section 75(2)
favoured the wife and made an adjustment of 25% in
her favour.
concluded a just and equitable outcome in the circumstances provided for the
wife to receive 60% of the parties' net property and
superannuation and the
husband receive 40%.
the division, it was agreed each party was to retain certain assets and
liabilities, as set out at [230] and [231] of
the Reasons. I found it was just
and equitable to make orders by way of a superannuation splitting order in
favour of the wife,
which required a base amount to be allocated to her
of $102,957.
proposed orders be made, subject to the parties advising the Court as to the
form of the orders and the Court being satisfied that
procedural fairness
had been afforded to the trustee of the husband's fund. The husband was to
retain the [boat] and [Motor vehicle
A], and the wife was to receive funds
held in joint accounts, which were then to be closed. Those entitlements
were reflected at
[230] and [231] of the Reasons.
found the husband was then required to pay to the wife $740,765 to give effect
to the division and sought submissions as to the
form of the orders to give
effect to the Reasons.
publication of the Reasons, the proceedings were adjourned to today, to allow
the parties to confer as to the form of the
orders. Each party has filed
their own minute, and, as a result, time has been taken this morning to clarify,
effectively, what
orders are agreed to give effect to the Reasons.
relation to the orders which are proposed to be pronounced, firstly, the
introductory recital in the wife's
reflect the provisions of
. In my view, that is an appropriate introduction to the
orders and will be included. The balance of the recitals in the wife's
are appropriate, agreed to be accurate by the husband and will
be included.
intend to make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the wife's minute because
that reflects the Reasons in which I was satisfied
it was appropriate to set
aside the instruments as identified, and an order will be made in those
relation to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the wife's minute, they provide that within
seven days, all monies held in joint bank accounts
are to be paid to the wife
and the amounts closed. The husband proposes that the wife receive specified
amounts insofar as they
were reflected in the Reasons at [231]. In the Reasons
I found at [229] that to provide the wife with her entitlements, she would
receive the funds held in the joint accounts, which would then be closed. In my
view, the form of the orders proposed by the wife
reflect the Reasons. I will
make orders in terms of paragraphs 2 and 3.
am otherwise satisfied that an order should be made in terms of paragraph 4.
There is an agreement between the parties in relation
to the timing of the
payment and the quantum of the payment. I am not satisfied that an order should
be made in relation to paragraph
5 at this time. In the event that
there is non-payment in accordance with the orders, the parties have liberty to
apply, and any
such further issues arising can then be dealt with.
relation to paragraph 6, the wife seeks a raft of orders in relation to the sale
of [Property B] in the event the husband fails
to make the payment. I
observed and made clear in the Reasons that if payment was not made or if the
husband elected to sell Property
B, then it may be necessary for the property to
be sold. At this stage, I am not persuaded to make the orders in terms set out.
In the absence of payment being made, then there is a liberty to apply.
in the Reasons, I made clear that if Property B was to be sold, that the sale
price, the costs of sale, the capital gains
tax and any capital losses would
also need to be taken into account. For those reasons, if Property B was to be
sold, I would not
be satisfied that an order should be made in terms of
paragraph 6.6.4 as sought by the wife. The Reasons made plain that the amounts
would be adjusted to reflect those actual
the reasons made clear in the exchange during the course of the hearing this
morning, orders will be made in terms of paragraphs
7 to 10, which give
effect to the allocation of a base amount, noting that procedural fairness has
been afforded to the trustee of
the husband's fund, who has confirmed those form
relation to paragraph 11, on the basis the husband does not seek those orders,
which effectively operate for his benefit, I will
not make orders in those
relation to paragraph 12, the order simply reflects the husband having a
liability in relation to assets that he is to retain
in relation to the trusts.
In my view, those orders are appropriate, and will be made.
is no issue now between the parties in relation to paragraph 13. The only
amendment that I propose is that paragraph 13.10
be amended to note that the
husband retaining his superannuation entitlements is subject to the
superannuation splitting order, that
is being made today.
there will be an order made in terms of paragraph 14, save that, I propose, 14.2
be deleted, in circumstances where [Business
A] has been
de-registered.
will be an order in terms of paragraph 15. There will be an order that in
relation to paragraph 16, save that I am not satisfied,
that an order should be
made in terms of 16.4 as indicated in the Reasons. If Property B is to be
sold, the capital gains tax is
to be met out of the sale proceeds, and will not
be subject to the husband having sole responsibility and indemnifying the
my view, paragraph 17 is otiose. I decline to make an order in those
18 to 20 are standard and procedural, and I will make orders in those
should be standard orders to dismiss all interim orders, dismiss outstanding
applications, and return exhibits and subpoenaed
documents, subject to any
