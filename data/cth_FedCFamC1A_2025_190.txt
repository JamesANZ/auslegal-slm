EX TEMPORE REASONS FOR
appeal is listed for hearing on 19 November 2025. This is the appellant’s
application to adjourn the hearing on the grounds
that his preferred choice of
senior and junior counsel are not available and the additional costs he will
incur in having to retain
new counsel. The application is opposed by the
respondent. The Independent Children’s Lawyer neither consents nor opposes
application.
23 June 2025, a final property and parenting order was made by a judge of the
Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division
1) and on 18 July 2025 a
Notice of Appeal was filed. Appeal directions were made on 25 August 2025
listing the appeal for hearing
on 29 October 2025. At that time, the respondent
foreshadowed an application to adjourn the appeal hearing as her senior and
counsel, who had represented her since 2023, were not available on the
proposed hearing date. The respondent promptly filed an Application
in an Appeal
on 3 September 2025. The adjournment was opposed.
11 September 2025, the appeal hearing was adjourned for three weeks, i.e. to 19
November 2025, because of the additional $80,000
in costs the respondent
contended she would incur if she had to retain new counsel. The appeal hearing
was not adjourned to meet
counsel’s convenience.
the hearing on 11 September 2025, the appellant made the following
concessions:
(a) The appellant had already retained new senior counsel, namely, Mr Brown KC,
as his preferred senior counsel, Mr Puckey KC, was
not available on the original
appeal hearing date, namely, 29 October 2025;
(b) Given the proposed three-week adjournment from 29 October 2025 to 19
November 2025, the appellant “would be hard pressed
prejudice”;
(c) The appellant’s “silk and junior are not appearing at the
appeal. That’s his choice. He comes before the court
wanting to get the
matter on as quickly as
concessions were made in circumstances where the appellant informed the Court
that neither Mr Puckey KC nor Dr Mort were available
on 19 November 2025.
Neither Mr Puckey KC nor Dr Mort represented him at the trial.
Notwithstanding
the appellant’s knowledge that neither of his preferred counsel would be
available for the adjourned appeal
hearing, it seems he continued to retain
them, and notwithstanding his already having retained alternative counsel,
namely, Mr Brown
KC (whom I note is available on 19 November 2025). Mr Puckey KC
and Dr Mort settled the appellant’s Summary of Argument which
was filed on
17 October 2025.
appellant contends that he has incurred fees to Mr Puckey KC of $22,200 and to
Dr Mort of $47,410 and that to retain them for
the appeal hearing the estimate
of their further costs are $39,600 for Mr Puckey KC and $19,800 for Dr Mort,
i.e. total fees of $129,010.
appellant has obtained estimates from two alternative senior and two alternative
junior counsel and has been advised that their
combined fees range from $165,000
to $204,600 or $140,100 to $175,800 for a one-day appeal hearing where the
Summary of Argument
has already been filed. As the appellant’s counsel
submitted before Austin J on 11 September 2025, it might be that “there
hasn’t been proper due diligence in relation to other available counsel
that could be of a more – that could be more
economically attractive to
the situation”.
is most unfortunate for the appellant that he finds himself in this predicament
and I am not without sympathy for him as it seems
he may well incur additional
costs in briefing alternative counsel for the appeal. However, adjourning the
appeal hearing may not
avoid those additional costs as I am unable to say when
the appeal would be able to come on for hearing other than to indicate that
unless another appeal already listed in December 2025 does not proceed, it will
not be until sometime next year. If the appeal is
adjourned, we may be in the
same position when alternative dates are allocated. It is essential that the
appeal be disposed of without
further delay.
DISPOSITION
am not persuaded that the appeal hearing should be adjourned, and the
application will be dismissed.
appellant concedes that as he has been wholly unsuccessful it is difficult to
resist a costs order. The appellant will be ordered
respondent’s costs of and incidental to the application in the appeal
fixed in the sum of $8,197 and payable within
