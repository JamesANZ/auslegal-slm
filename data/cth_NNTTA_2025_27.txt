REASONS FOR DISMISSAL
12 July 2024, the
of Western Australia gave notice under
Native Title Act
(Cth) of its intention to grant
prospecting licence P 20/2517 to McCallum Scott Johnston and Margaret Ann
Cameron (the
notice included a statement that the
State considers the grant of the proposed licence to be an act attracting the
expedited procedure
Native Title Act
(expedited procedure
statement).
expedited procedure applies, the State may grant the proposed licence without
requiring parties to enter the right to negotiate
procedure per
Native Title Act
[3] The proposed
licence is located approximately 10 km in an easterly direction from Cue and
covers an area of approximately 0.46
km². It is entirely overlapped by the
Yugunga-Nya
People Part A native title determination (WCD2021/0008), held
in trust by the Yugunga-Nya Native Title Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC
registered body corporate.
[4] On 15 July
2024, Yugunga-Nya lodged an objection to the State’s assertion that the
expedited procedure applies to the grant
of the licence with the National Native
. The objection application was lodged within the timeframe
outlined in
Native Title Act
and as such, under
the Tribunal is required to determine whether the grant of the proposed licence
is an act attracting the expedited procedure.
Relevant Facts
correspondence to the Tribunal dated 11 March 2025, the grantee stated its
preference for the matter to proceed to inquiry
and the matter was subsequently
referred to a directions hearing on 30 April 2025.
30 April 2025 I made directions requiring all parties to provide submissions to
the inquiry. Yuguna-Nya were directed to provide
contentions and evidence by 2
July 2025 however on the date of compliance, no contentions or evidence was
received from Yugunga-Nya.
[7] On 9 July
2025, the Tribunal emailed all parties noting that Yugunga-Nya had failed to
comply with directions and that the objection
application was now at risk of
dismissal. Parties were provided until 16 July 2025 to make any comments
however no response was
received from Yunguga-Nya by this date.
Consideration of Dismissal
[8] Pursuant
Native Title Act
, the Tribunal may dismiss an
objection application at any stage of the inquiry in circumstances where the
native title party fails
within a reasonable time to proceed with the objection
application or to comply with a direction of the Tribunal. While the Tribunal
has broad discretion to dismiss an objection application, doing so has
significant consequences for the native title party and is
not an action taken
[9] The nature
of the expedited procedure and the principles relevant to consideration of
dismissal of an objection application for
failure to comply with directions are
set out in the Tribunal's decision in
Teelow v Page
([13]). I have
applied those principles in my consideration of this matter.
[10] On this
occasion, it is my view that Yugunga-Nya has been afforded sufficient
opportunity to progress this objection application
but have failed to do so
within a reasonable time. The Tribunal granted several extensions to enable
Yugunga-Nya to provide evidence
into the inquiry however Yugunga-Nya have failed
to comply with directions on each occasion.
[11] Having
regard to all of the facts and circumstances of this matter, I am satisfied that
the objection application should be
Determination
expedited procedure objection application in relation to prospecting licence P
20/2517 is dismissed under
