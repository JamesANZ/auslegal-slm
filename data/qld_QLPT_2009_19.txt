SOLICITORS:
Legal Services Commission for the applicant
[1] The Commissioner filed a discipline application against the respondent,
Patrick Brendan Cain, pursuant to
Legal Profession Act 2007
(“the 2007 Act”) on 30 January 2009 as a result of an investigation
undertaken by him pursuant to s 435(1)(c) of the
practitioner has admitted the charges which the Commissioner alleged constitute
professional misconduct. Those charges are:
Charge 1 – Failure to
lodge returns
1. Between 1 July 1997 and 11 April 2006, the respondent
engaged in conduct for which he was convicted on 15 May 2007 of six taxation
offences, namely he failed to lodge five income taxation returns and one GST
return as required.
Particulars
1.1 At all material times the respondent
was an Australian legal practitioner.
1.2 Between 1 July 1997 and 11 April
2006 the respondent failed to furnish personal income tax returns as required
for the financial
years ended 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999, 30 June 2000, 30 June
2001 and 30 June 2005.
1.3 On 15 May 2007 the respondent pleaded guilty to,
and was convicted of, five offences under
Administration Act 1953
(Cth), namely failing to furnish income taxation returns
for the financial years ended 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999, 30 June 2000,
2001 and 30 June 2005 to the Taxation Commissioner when and as required by

Taxation Administration Act 1953
(Cth), namely failing to furnish a GST
return for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 September 2005 to the Taxation
Commissioner when and
as required by Division 31 of the
A New Tax System (Goods
and Services Tax) Act 1999
Charge 2 – Failure to comply with
s 443(3) Notice
2. The respondent, without reasonable excuse, failed to
comply with a written notice issued by the Legal Services Commissioner pursuant
section 443(3)
Legal Profession Act 2007
Particulars
2.1 By letter dated 12 December 2007 the
Commissioner advised the respondent that he had commenced an investigation in
relation to
conduct for which the respondent was convicted on 15 May 2007 of six
taxation offences. The Commissioner requested the respondent’s
explanation of his conduct by 14 January 2008.
2.2 The respondent did not
respond to the Commissioner’s letter of 12 December 2007 within the time
2.3 By letter dated 7 February 2008 the Commissioner required the
respondent pursuant to s 443(1)(a)(i) of the Act to provide his
explanation
by 22 February 2008.
2.4 A written explanation was not provided by the
respondent within the time specified.
2.5 By letter dated 25 February 2008
the Commissioner gave the respondent written notice pursuant to s 443(3) of
the Act that he may
be dealt with for professional misconduct if his failure to
provide the explanation as required continued for a further 14 days,
beyond 10 March 2008.
2.6 The respondent failed, within the 14 dayss period
specified in the Notice, to comply with the requirement to give to the
Commissioner
the requested explanation and failed to provide the Commissioner
with a reasonable excuse for not complying with the requirement
within that
[3] Mr Cain was born in 1956 and was admitted to
practise as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland by mutual recognition
on 9 January 1998 having previously been admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme
Court of Victoria in 1992.
[4] With the exception of a period between 11
March and 12 October 2002 Mr Cain has been employed as a consultant or an
employed solicitor
at various law practices in Queensland since his admission to
practice in Queensland.
[5] This matter came to the attention of the
Queensland Law Society (“the Society”) when Mr Cain informed the
as he was obliged to do, on 26 May 2007 followed by his filling of a
notice of a show cause event on 8 October 2007.
[6] There is no
doubt that a failure to lodge income tax returns and pay tax liability is
misconduct capable of constituting unsatisfactory
professional conduct or
professional misconduct: see s 420(c)(ii) of the 2007 Act.
conduct which falls within the meaning of unsatisfactory professional conduct is
set out in s 418 of the 2007 Act which provides:
418 Meaning
of unsatisfactory professional conduct
Unsatisfactory professional conduct
includes conduct of an
Australian legal practitioner happening in connection with the practice of law
that falls short of the standard
of competence and diligence that a member of
the public is entitled to expect of a reasonably competent Australian legal
practitioner.”
[8] The meaning of professional misconduct is set out in s 419 of the 2007 Act
which provides:
419 Meaning of professional
Professional misconduct
(a) unsatisfactory professional conduct of an Australian legal practitioner,
if the conduct involves a substantial or consistent failure
to reach or keep a
reasonable standard of competence and diligence; and
(b) conduct of an Australian legal practitioner, whether happening in
connection with the practice of law or happening otherwise than
in connection
with the practice of law that would, if established, justify a finding that the
practitioner is not a fit and proper
person to engage in legal practice.
(2) For finding that an Australian legal practitioner is not a fit and proper
person to engage in legal practice as mentioned in subsection
(1), regard may be
had to the suitability matters that would be considered if the practitioner were
an applicant for admission to
the legal profession under this Act or for the
grant or renewal of a local practising certificate.”
[9] As he admitted, Mr Cain’s failure to furnish income tax returns on
five occasions and his failure to furnish a GST return
together constitute
professional misconduct. This is so because of the combined application of
s 420(c)(ii) and s 419(1)(a) of the
2007 Act. Each failure
constituted unsatisfactory professional conduct and because it was repeated on
so many occasions was a consistent
failure to reach or keep a reasonable
standard of competence and diligence so that it constituted professional
misconduct.
[10] As the Chief Justice held in Legal Services Commissioner v
Hewlett [2008] LPT 3 at [24]:
“One of the
substantial obligations of a legal practitioner is to uphold the law, and to
ensure the due application of the law
in furthering his or her clients’
affairs. The practitioner’s capacity and commitment in those regards will
into question where the practitioner is himself or herself guilty of a
substantial contravention of the law, knowingly and deliberately,
and for his or
her own financial advancement.”
[11] The reason why such behaviour is regard so seriously when it involves
convictions for tax offences is that it shows a disregard
for not only legal but
also civic obligations. As Spigelman CJ said of a barrister who was removed
from the roll in New South Wales
in New South Wales Bar Association v Somosi
[2001] NSWCA 285
“He took advantage of the full range of public
services made available by taxation, not least the provision of the court system
in which he earned his income. He left the burden of all of this to his fellow
citizens. Furthermore, for a period of almost two
decades he engaged in what I
described in
as the hypocrisy of putting himself in a position,
as a legal practitioner, in which he advocated that other people should perform
their legal obligations, while systematically failing to perform his
Comparison with other cases involving tax offences
[12] In Legal Services
Commissioner v Hewlett [2008] LPT 3, the practitioner had failed to file a tax
return on 11 occasions. He
continued to fail to lodge tax returns even when his
practice became very successful and generated high income. Rather than paying
the tax owing he had declared himself bankrupt. By the time he alerted the
Queensland Law Society to the matters the subject of
the charge he was indebted
to the Australian Tax Office (“ATO”) in the amount of $914,572.90
for tax, penalties and interest.
He had previously been censured for
professional default in 1995 and 1997, on the first occasion after a finding by
a Federal Court
judge that he had acted without instructions; and on the second
occasion for failing to comply with provisions of the
Trust Accounts Act 1973
respect of audit requirements and losing records for the trust accounts of two
firms. His name was removed from the roll of practitioners.
[13] In New
South Wales Bar Association v Somosi
[2001] NSWCA 285
, the practitioner neither
filed a taxation return nor paid income tax for a period of 17 years for the 17
financial years ended 30
June 1978 to 30 June 1994. He was convicted of 17
offences against
Taxation Administration Act 1953
in February 1996 and then in October 2000 he was convicted of an offence against
s 264(i)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act.
Even when the ATO sent
notices requiring compliance he was dilatory in attending to those requirements
which explained his further
conviction. Once these matters came to the
attention of the disciplinary authorities he continued to be derelict in his
an income tax return and had not filed the latest income tax return
which was due. At the time of the hearing he had still not paid
any of his over
due tax. He voluntarily removed his name from the roll of practitioners but
unsuccessfully opposed an order that
he was guilty of professional
misconduct.
[14] In New South Wales Bar Association v Cummins
[2001] NSWCA 284
(2001) 52 NSWLR
, the Court of Appeal in New South Wales made a formal declaration that the
practitioner was not a fit and proper person and that
his conduct constituted
professional misconduct. That case involved a barrister who failed to lodge a
taxation return for 38 years.
He consented to an order removing his name from
the roll of legal practitioners. This behaviour occurred from 1961 when he was
admitted to the Bar. Judgment in the sum of approximately $1,000,000 was
entered against him by the ATO and he thereupon presented
his own debtors
petition. He had established a trust “to provide a safe harbour for his
assets including his family home and
chambers against the prospect of being
sued.” The Court of Appeal referred to his failure to lodge any taxation
returns for
the 38 years as an “inexcusable pattern of illegal conduct in
complete defiance of his civic responsibilities.”
As the court said at 283:
“[The] agreed facts make it clear that over about four decades of
practice as a barrister, Mr Cummins was perfectly capable
of conducting his
personal and financial affairs – as a practitioner, director, investor,
manager – save in one respect.
He never performed his duties as a citizen
and tax payer.”
[15] In New South Wales Bar Association v Young
[2003] NSWCA 228
practitioner did not file any tax returns from 1 July 1980 to 28 November 1996
and from 1 July 1980 to 30 June 2000 he
did not pay any income tax at all. This
lack of integrity justified the removal of his name from the roll.
Davison v Council of the New South Wales Bar Association
[2007] NSWCA 227
legal practitioner failed to meet his income tax obligations for 16 years. As
well as his failure to meet his taxation obligations
in the amount of
$1,324,570.00, Mr Davison had lived an extravagant lifestyle and was not
regarded by the Tribunal as a truthful
and reliable witness. The Tribunal quite
properly took account of that in ordering his removal from the roll.
[17] The second charge deals with a failure to comply with a written notice
issued by the Commissioner pursuant to s 443(3) of the
2007 Act. That
section sets out the powers reposed in investigators and the obligations of a
practitioner being investigated. It
for investigations
(1) The entity carrying out an investigation as mentioned in section 435 or
436 may, for the investigation –
(a) require an Australian legal practitioner who is the subject of the
investigation –
(i) to give the entity, in writing or personally, within a stated reasonable
time a full explanation of the matter being investigated;
(ii) to appear before the entity at a stated reasonable time and place;
(iii) to produce to the entity within a stated reasonable time any document
in the practitioner’s custody, possession or control
that the practitioner
is entitled at law to produce; or
(b) engage a person, who the entity considers is qualified because the person
has the necessary expertise or experience, to report
on the reasonableness of an
Australian legal practitioner’s bill of costs.
(2) Subject to subsection (6), the practitioner must comply with a
requirement under subsection (1)(a).
Maximum penalty – 50 penalty units.
(3) If the practitioner fails to comply with the requirement, the entity may
give the practitioner written notice that if the failure
continues for a further
14 days after the notice is given, the practitioner may be dealt with for
professional misconduct.
(4) If notice under subsection (3) is given and the failure continues for the
14 day period –
(a) the Australian legal practitioner is taken to have committed professional
misconduct, unless the practitioner has a reasonable
excuse for not complying
with the requirement within the period; and
(b) the commissioner may apply to the tribunal for an order in relation to
the charge that the practitioner has committed professional
misconduct as stated
in paragraph (a) as if the application were an application in relation to a
complaint against the practitioner.
(5) In a hearing before the tribunal about a charge of professional
misconduct, a copy of the notice mentioned in subsection (3) and
any enclosures
with the notice are evidence of the matters in the notice and the
enclosures.
(6) An Australian legal practitioner may refuse to give the entity an
explanation of a matter being investigated if –
(a) the practitioner satisfies the entity that to give the explanation would
contravene, or invalidate, a policy for professional
indemnity insurance held by
the practitioner; or
(b) the explanation would tend to incriminate the practitioner.
(7) A regulation may provide for how part 4.9 applies to an application to
the tribunal for an order in relation to a charge that
a legal practitioner has
committed professional misconduct as stated in subsection (4)(a) and may be
dealt with under that part as
an application in relation to a complaint against
the practitioner.”
[18] It can be seen that the failure to comply with a requirement under
s 443(3) of the 2007 Act may have serious consequences for
practitioner.
[19] Mr Cain failed to comply with a notice given under s
443(3) of the 2007 Act. The failure was without reasonable excuse and so,
the Tribunal’s view, prima facie constituted professional misconduct.
[20] The Commissioner relied on the following passage from Legal Services
Commissioner v Browne,
where the Tribunal
“The Tribunal again sends a very clear message to the profession that
Practitioners must comply with correspondence sent to
them by the Commissioner
or the Law Society in a timely fashion. In
Veghelyi -v- Council of the Law
Society of New South Wales
12662 of 1989, unreported, NSW SC6/9/89, Mr
Justice Smart stated at page 16:
‘It is important that Solicitors respond promptly to the Society when
it asks for a reply in response to complaints that have
been made. It will be
an unusual and complex case when a delay of more than 14 days is acceptable and
often, the replies should
be delivered within a shorter period such as 7/10
days. Replies to the Law Society in respect of complaints warrant a high
[21] As this Tribunal said in Legal Services Commissioner v Richardson [2009]
LTP 17 at [277] – [279]:
“[277] A member of the public who makes a
complaint against a legal practitioner to the practitioner’s professional
association
or the statutory body set up to investigate complaints is, in the
Tribunal’s view, entitled to expect that a reasonably competent
practitioner will respond competently and diligently to the investigation of
that complaint. The public interest in maintaining
confidence in the legal
profession demands no less.
[279] The public is entitled to expect a legal practitioner, unless he or
she finds himself or herself in peril under s 443(6), to
“candid” and “co-operative” to use the words of Pincus
QLS v Carberry; A-G v Carberry
[2000] QCA 450
. This is part
of his or her professional duties.”
[22] No reasonable excuse was offered at the hearing of the discipline
application. The failure was a result of the combined effects
procrastination and avoidance. It follows that, as he admitted, the
practitioner should also be found guilty of professional
misconduct under the
second charge.
[23] As the Commissioner submitted, when considering
the appropriate penalty to be imposed following a finding of professional
misconduct,
regard is to be had primarily to the need to protect the public.
The Court of Appeal held in QLS v Carberry
[2000] QCA 450
the primary role of proceedings such as those before the Tribunal is to protect
the public from persons not fit to be held
out as officers of the court and as a
proper person to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of the

Attorney-General v Bax
[1999] 2 QdR 9
at 21 by Pincus JA,
there is a subsidiary purpose in the public interest and that is to deter other
practitioners who might otherwise
engage in professional misconduct.”
[24] Disciplinary proceedings are protective rather than punitive in nature:
Legal Services Commissioner v Madden
[2008] QCA 301.
The question is whether
the practitioner is at this time fit to
The appropriate orders in this case
require not only an examination of the seriousness of the practitioner’s
conduct but also
a consideration of the factors which are in the
practitioner’s favour. They tend to show that so long as appropriate
for practice are put in place the practitioner is not unfit to
[25] Mr Cain’s disciplinary charges appear to arise from his
being overwhelmed by circumstances rather than because of any dishonesty.
Unlike Hewlett there were no previous adverse findings against him. His failure
to lodge income tax returns did not continue for
the length of time nor did it
involve the amount of money of any of the cases referred to herein; he was not
motivated by greed;
did not live a lavish lifestyle; and was prepared to repay
the moneys owed rather than transfer his assets into another name or declare
himself bankrupt.
[26] His personal circumstances show that he has suffered
and been able to overcome adversity. After recovering from a very serious
injury from a motor vehicle accident which occurred not long after he left
school, Mr Cain married at a relatively young age and
deferred his university
studies when his first child was born. He and his wife had three children while
he worked fulltime and studied
law part-time. When he was in his second last
year of study his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer while she was pregnant
the youngest child. She went into remission and he completed his law
studies in 1989 but the cancer returned and his wife died in
[27] He was admitted to legal practice in Victoria in 1992. He then
took on the burden of sole practice and caring for his three
young children. He
suffered from depression and was drinking too much. So in 1994, he decided to
change career so that he would
have more time to look after the children. He
completed a diploma of education at Melbourne University in 1994.
1995 he moved to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland to live where his sister and
her family were living and able to provide
support for him. He lost confidence
and worked in a number of unskilled positions until 1997 when he was offered a
position at a
law firm on the Sunshine Coast. He was admitted to practise as a
solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland on 9 January 1998.
He was unable
to keep up fulltime practice but then took on work as a consultant particularly
in the area of criminal law and to
a lesser extent family law. He continued to
suffer from depression. Eight years ago he gave up drinking and five years ago
on work with Lynch and Associates fulltime.
[29] He failed however to
keep his books in order. In 2001 he employed a bookkeeper to get all his
financial records in order and
to assist with the filing of tax returns which
had not previously been filed. She disappeared and he lost his records. During
years 2002 to 2004 he employed another bookkeeper who applied herself
diligently and got his books in order. He lodged his tax returns
for the 2002,
2003 and 2004 years on time. He then employed a firm of accountants to do the
outstanding returns for the years 1998
to 2001 and 2005 which were the subject
of the charges. He has subsequently remarried and has two small children.
[30] Before he was dealt with on the income tax matters on 15 May 2007 he
had attended to the lodgement of his outstanding tax returns
and GST returns.
Mr Cain was extremely contrite and remorseful for his actions. He intends to
pay the outstanding tax of about
$70,000 from the sale of his residential
property which is listed for sale. He has undertaken to execute a mortgage over
that property
in favour of the ATO as security for his indebtedness and this
undertaking will be incorporated into the orders.
[31] He has sought the
assistance of a psychologist, Cecilia Bendall, who provided two reports to the
court. He is undertaking a
programme of treatment to deal with his unresolved
grief and to extinguish his maladaptive automatic protective mechanism of
when feeling emotionally overwhelmed. Mr Cain was supported by a
reference from his employer, Patrick Lynch, who speaks highly of
conscientiousness, his commitment to often legally aided clients and his
readiness to work after hours including weekends. Mr
Lynch also speaks of Mr
Cain’s contribution to the welfare of the community both by after hours
pro bono work at the Suncoast
Community Legal Service and by the onerous legally
aided work he undertakes.
[32] The parties were able to reach agreement as to
the terms of the conditions which should be imposed if the Tribunal accepted,
it has, that he is fit to practice if subject to those conditions.
