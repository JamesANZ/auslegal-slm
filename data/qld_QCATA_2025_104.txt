APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
REASONS FOR DECISION
appeal raises two preliminary issues before the substance of the appeal can be
considered. Firstly, the admission of fresh
evidence. Secondly, whether the
Tribunal’s minor civil dispute jurisdiction is enlivened to hear and
determine the application,
because it is a building dispute. Because the dispute
is a building dispute, for the reasons below it could not be determined as
minor civil dispute. To do so is an error of law and therefore although leave to
appeal is granted, the appeal must be allowed
and the proceeding below
[2] Michael
is a sole trader and
caries on business as Walls Hand Crafted. He holds a trade contractors, solid
plaster, licence with the Queensland
Building and Construction Commission. In or
finishing product called microcement, to the floor and walls of the main
bathroom, and other wet areas, of their house. Although
there is no direct
evidence about the product, I glean from what was said at the hearing and
material filed, that it is a coating
applied to the surface of the floor and
walls to give the appearance of a cement
The coating is laid over a
mesh base, presumably fixed to the surface of the floor and walls. A number of
coasts are required.
[3] After the
respondent carried out the work, applicants were dissatisfied with the finish of
the main bathroom. After the respondent
did some rectification work they were
still not happy so decided to have the bathroom re-coated by another contractor,
Earth House,
at a cost of $6,336.00 in early March 2023.They then sought to
recover that amount from the respondent and commenced a proceeding
in the minor
civil disputes jurisdiction of the Tribunal on 6 March 3023. The application was
defended by the respondent, generally
on the basis that he was not responsible
for the falls in the floor and which was a cause of the problems, and the
applicants (or
their builder) failed to have the joints between the floor and
the wall chaulked or sealed which allowed water penetration.
[4] After a
hearing on 21 March 2024
evidence of both parties was considered, the adjudicator was not satisfied that
the applicants established, on balance,
the respondent was liable to the
applicants for any defective work. The application was dismissed. The principle
reason for dismissing
the application is that the adjudicator who heard the case
was not satisfied that the applicants had produced sufficient probative
independent evidence that the cause of the defects, mainly falls in the floor
and sealing, was the fault of the respondent.
[5] From that
decision, the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal or appeal on 17
April 2024. Because this is an appeal
from a decision in the minor civil
disputes jurisdiction leave to appeal is required under
s 142(3)(a)(i)
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
is necessary. Leave
to appeal (or permission) will usually only be granted where there is a
reasonable argument the decision was
attended by error, or that an appeal is
necessary to correct any substantial injustice caused by the
It is not a rehearing of the
proceeding below.
[6] As Judicial
Member McGill SC said in
Allen v Queensland Building and Construction
As a general proposition, when leave to appeal to the Appeal Tribunal is
required, it will be granted only where there is a reasonable
argument that the
decision was attended by error and an appeal is necessary to correct a
substantial injustice caused by that error,
or where the appeal raises a
question of general importance upon which further argument and a decision of the
Appeal Tribunal would
be to the public advantage. An Appeal Tribunal would not
usually disturb findings of fact on appeal if the evidence is capable of
supporting the finding, and it is not contrary to compelling interferences. If
leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is by way of
rehearing so far as it is
against a decision on a question of fact, or of mixed fact and law: the QCAT Act
s 147. Otherwise it is
an appeal which will only correct an error of law: the
QCAT Act s 146
[7] The grounds
of appeal are not specific, but rather a submission about the credit of the
respondent and a reference to new evidence
to substantiate the applicants’
claim. In attempting to identify error in the adjudicator’s decision, by
reference the
reasons and evidence before him, the applicants in the appeal are
attempting to relitigate their whole case.
[8] As I have
already mentioned, an application for leave to appeal is not a fresh hearing of
the application on the merits, having
regard to additional “fresh”
evidence filed in the appeal.
Fresh Evidence
particular as noted in the “grounds” the applicants rely on new or
fresh evidence Firstly, a two page
from Tony Thorogood, a
sales representative for Calce Company Pty Ltd, the company that supplied the
microcement coating. Secondly,
a statement of evidence from Mr Hardie, a
qualified plasterer dated 9 April 2024. He inspected the work and commented on
and observations as to water spotting and ponding. Also, mesh showing
through the coating. He also has provided an expert opinion
as how microcement
is to be applied. There is a third piece of evidence being a short email
statement builder, Ashley Glover, who
say the builder paid the respondent to
‘make repairs to the falls”. Also he was paid to redo the floor for
which he was
sometimes difficult for some self-represented litigants to appreciate that when
seeking to lead new or fresh evidence in
appeals, the appeal tribunal is
constrained, as are the courts, by judicial authority as to the circumstances
when fresh evidence
can be relied upon in an appeal. The leading case regularly
referred to establish special grounds to admit fresh evidence in an appeal
Clarke v Japan Machines (Aust) Pty Ltd
[1984] Qd R 404
at 408. It was
recently cited with approval in the Court of Appeal in
Chapel of Angels Pty
ltd & Ors v Hennessey Building Pty Ltd & Ors
[2022] QCA 232.
court said at [38]:
The test of “special grounds” has been long settled:
Japan Machines (Aust) Pty Ltd
[1984] 1 Qd R 404
at 408. Three conditions
must be fulfilled:
(a) it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with
reasonable diligence for use at the trial;
(b) the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an
important influence on the result of the case, although
it need not be decisive;
(c) the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other
words, it must be apparently credible, though it need
not be incontrovertible.
[11] Even though
there is no filed application to lead fresh evidence by the applicants which is
usually necessary, the respondent
has partly responded to the fresh evidence. He
challenges some of the statements made by Mr Thorogood, in particular about
the joints and water testing before this was done. There is no
response to the statement of Mr Hardie.
[12] Of the
three conditions referred to in
above, and having read the
additional statements constituting the fresh evidence, conditions (b) and (c)
would be satisfied. However,
it is (a) which is problematic for the applicants.
Mr Thorogood did provide a brief statement for the hearing with photographs
the adjudicator referred to. He could easily have provided more detailed
evidence as contained in the new statement before the hearing,
or even if he was
made available to give evidence at the hearing.
[13] As for Mr
Hardie, he carried out, or supervised, the rectification work and therefore he
could have provided the evidence contained
in his statement at the hearing. In
fact it was critical evidence, in my view, not only to establish the work was
done but also the
value of the work for assessing damages. All the applicants
relied upon was the invoice, as the adjudicator noted.
[14] Mr Grover
was another obvious witness to establish the work done by the respondent. There
was no evidence from him.
[15] I have
therefore concluded that all of the fresh evidence sought to be relied upon by
the applicants could have been obtained
with reasonable diligence for use at the
primary hearing. As a consequence of this decision, I do not, and cannot, rely
on the fresh
evidence in determining whether leave to appeal should be granted,
and of course the substantive appeal if leave is granted. However,
greater problem with jurisdiction discussed below.
Some further background.
further background is necessary to answer the next question on jurisdiction. On
5 November 2022 the respondent provided
a quotation for the job, including other
wet areas, for a total cost of $15,036.00. The coating work was carried out
after renovation
work was complete. The applicants were dissatisfied with the
work and made a complaint to the Queensland Building and Construction
on 9 March 2023. After some negotiations, the compliant in respect of the wet
areas, other than the main bathroom was
[17] The main
problem with the bathroom, as I perceive it from the evidence, was that the
falls on the floor were not correct. This
caused ponding of water and some pin
hole bubbling in the microcement coating. The falls were the responsibility of
the builder,
Ashley Grove of Grove Built. The respondent agreed to carry out
rectification work by re-coating the floor with microcement in early
March 2023.
The respondent relies on this email
to the applicants’ builder Ashley Grover, he said:
Hi Ash, this text is to note that the alterations I am making to the screeded
floor prior to the microcement. Please be aware that
I am not responsible for
the falls and/ or any water ponding that may occur after finishing in
microcement as I am only following
the screeded floor that had already been
placed down.
[18] In response
to this text, Mr Grove confirmed that the respondent should proceed with the
“alteration to the floor as discussed”.
The respondent then
proceeded to do the work.
[19] The timing
of this work is best described in the evidence of Ms

this further work there were still the
problems with ponding and bubbling.
applicant engaged with Mr Thorogood a sales representative of the product
manufacture Calce Company, to address this issue.
Unbeknown to the applicant Mr
Thorogood then prepared an “Product Investigation” report for the
applicants to determine
if the product was defective, or whether it was because
of the way it was applied. In respect of the main bathroom he said
Issues in this room range from internal and external corners left rough which
will create watertight issues and allow moisture penetration
overtime. The fall
is still not correct and moisture will pool in areas on the floor. Mesh showing
under the top coat which will
need to be recoated. Some areas are left very
rough which will allow moisture to penetrate via pinholes. Overall general
not of acceptable standard for warranty

applicants engaged Earth House to redo the
walls and floor in early March
for an eventual cost of
$6,545.00. They demanded to be reimbursed by the respondent for this cost on the
basis of his defective or
incomplete work. He did not pay so they instituted a

has been settled now for some time that a building dispute cannot be heard a
minor civil dispute. The reason for this has
been explained in many appeal
In particular in
Broadbelt Electrical Pty Ltd v Harrison
[2022] QCTA 91 Senior Member Brown
explained, in some detail by reference to the definitions in Sch 2 of the
Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act
Act”) of building work, domestic building dispute, and tribunal work that
this type of claim is not a minor civil
dispute as defined in Sch 3 of the QCAT
A ‘minor civil dispute’ is relevantly defined as:
1 (a).. a claim to recover a debt or liquidated demand...;
(b)...................
if an enabling Act confers jurisdiction on the tribunal to deal with a claim
(however called) within the meaning of paragraph
1(a), the claim is not a minor
civil dispute unless the enabling Act expressly states it is a minor civil
[24] Even though
s 12 of the QCAT Act confers jurisdiction to hear and determine minor civil
disputes, the jurisdiction is subject
to the QBCC Act, which is the enabling Act
referred to in the definition above. The QBCC Act confers jurisdiction on the
to decide a ‘building dispute’, which under s 77 is defined
(a) ‘Building dispute’ relevantly includes domestic building
disputes and minor commercial building disputes;
(b) Domestic building dispute” means a claim or dispute arising between
building owner and a building contractor, or between
two building contractors
relating to the performance of or a contract for the performance of reviewable
domestic work;
(c) ...............
[25] This is a
building dispute between a trade contractor and the building owners, the
applicants. The work the subject of the dispute
is plainly reviewable domestic
building work, which has already been the subject of review by the QBCC. The
was put succinctly by Member Gordon in
Lucas v Habul
[2020] QCATA 53
The tribunal’s current considered view on point
is given in
Skinner v FTP
Contracting Pty Ltd & Anor (No 2)
[2020] QCATA 12
, [36], that the
requirement in section 77(2) applies to all building disputes even if the
application appears also to be a minor
civil dispute as defined. This means that
the tribunal will never have jurisdiction to hear a building dispute where the
has not complied with a process established by the Commission to
attempt to resolve the dispute.
[26] Therefore
the minor civil dispute tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute. The
decision below must be set aside. The
applicants are not without remedy. They
can institute new proceedings provided they comply with s 77(2) of the QBCC Act
which states
However, the person may not apply to the tribunal unless the person has complied
with a process established by the commission to
attempt to resolve the dispute.
[27] The only
evidence of any engagement with the QBCC is the Decision Notice of 12 January
2024. That Notice records that there were
complaints made about each of the wet
arears on 9 March 2023. Complaints items 1 – 6 inclusive relate to the
bathroom. The
works were not inspected by the Commission until 21 September
2023. On 4 October 2023 a decision was made to issue a Direction to
relation to items 9 (laundry), 12 (ensuite), 13(ensuite) and 15 (ensuite).
[28] However, it
seems that there was no “attempt to resolve the dispute” in respect
of the main bathroom after the rectification
work was done by the respondent. It
seems from Mrs Arber’s submission in the appeal, under the heading
“I called Brian
Delaney from QBCC....”, that there was some
engagement with the QBCC prior to the applicants’ paying Mr Hardie and
reimbursement from the respondent. It is unlikely there would have
been any resolution process before filing the application on 6
because after lodging the complaint with the Commission on 9 March 2023, the
work was carried out before 10 March 2023.
minor civil dispute could not, as a matter of law, be decided by an adjudicator
in the minor civil dispute jurisdiction.
Given the lack of jurisdiction, the
decision of 21 March 2024 was made in error and must be set aside.
[30] As I cannot
be satisfied that s 77(2) of the QBCC Act has been complied with, I cannot
transfer the application to the building
list in the Tribunal.
[31] I therefore
propose to make the following orders:
(a) Leave to appeal is granted.
(b) The appeal is allowed.
(c) The decision of the Tribunal of 21 March 2024 is set aside.
(d) The application MCD126-23 (Southport) is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
