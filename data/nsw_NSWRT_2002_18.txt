REASONS FOR DECISION
These matters were heard on 11 December 2001, Ms Wheeler and Mr McKercher,
appearing as applicants, and Mr Attard as respondent.
The three applications
each relate to goods, the property of either Ms Wheeler, her son Mr McKercher,
or her mother Mrs McKercher,
who authorised Ms Wheeler to appear on her behalf.
The application seeks orders for the respondent to deliver up property
pursuant to
section 79A
Residential Tenancies Act 1987
The applications were out of time under
section 79B
, but I extended
the time under section 74 of the
Residential Tribunal Act 1998
satisfied that there was no prejudice to the respondent notwithstanding that the
tenancy had been terminated in April 2001
by the Tribunal. The respondent
wished to have the goods removed, but there had been difficulties between the
parties in having
this done by private arrangement. In this respect, she
tendered two statutory declarations. At the commencement of the hearing,
applicant Ms Wheeler sought to orally amend her claim to raise matters relating
to the original application to terminate the
tenancy (01/00656) on 2 April 2001,
which was the subject of a section 63 application for a re-hearing (01/16299).
This order was
not granted.
I informed Ms Wheeler that the application
before me was only in respect of the application for delivery of the goods left
tenancy was terminated. I had no jurisdiction to hear any application
arising out of the termination.
In a letter dated 15 July 2001 to Ms
Wheeler, the Registrar had explained that this part of the matter could not be
further pursued
except by application to the Supreme Court.
applicants sought to amend the applications to claim compensation for damage to
the goods which have remained in the respondent’s
custody. I refused the
application for the following reasons:
the respondent had been given notice
only of an application for an order to deliver goods.
there was no evidence adduced that the
goods were damaged or deteriorated due to the respondent’s action or
The Tribunal has no jurisdiction
to hear and determine an application for damage to goods. The decision of
(RTT 96/29302) held that such an
application did not arise out of a breach of a tenancy agreement (in respect of
which the Tribunal
has jurisdiction) but was a claim for compensation under the
general law which must be brought in another court. There was no reason
However, I was satisfied that all parties wished to
have the matter of the goods resolved, and I made orders largely as requested
Ms Wheeler, including allowing her, due to the volume of goods concerned and her
injuries from an accident, a full five days to
removed the goods from the
respondent’s custody.
