REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
O’Reilly says Ms Dempsey damaged a grevillea tree on common property
alongside her lot and it subsequently died, compromising
the privacy and amenity
of her lot. She notified the body corporate committee but it elected not to
issue Ms Dempsey with a by-law
contravention notice. She now seeks orders
against the body corporate in the following terms:
- Issue lot
owner of unit 20 with form 10 for violation of the complex by-laws, which state
“4. The occupier of a lot must
not, without the body corporates written
approval: a) damage a lawn, garden, tree, shrub, plant or flower on the common

body corporate engaged a contractor to remove 8 harpullia trees and trim other
trees away from the units. Ms O’Reilly
says the work was not to include
the grevillea alongside her lot, though Ms Dempsey disputes that and correctly
points out that the
contractor’s quotation did not specify the trees that
were to be trimmed away from the units. Ms O’Reilly’s photographs
show the grevillea was touching the side of the building before it was cut
[3] The work was
carried out on 25 January 2025. Ms O’Reilly advised Platinum
North’s body corporate manager at the time
that the contractor pruned the
She says the contractor
subsequently:
...sighted Katherine Dempsey causing significant
damage to the grevillea tree by breaking the trunk and branches, and stripping
and bark without appropriate tools. The contractor reported this to an
occupant of lot 25 on site who witnessed the damage after
the event. The
contractor offered to cut back the tree to remove the damage. This offer was
accepted to keep the common property
in reasonable appearance.
[4] Ms Dempsey
denies this version of events, claiming she:
...is slightly
built...aged 80...frail and in poor health...[and] simply incapable of
barehandedly breaking down the trunk and branches
of a well grown tree...
[5] She said she
only held a branch to prevent it from falling on a parked car while the
contractor cut it with a chainsaw.
[6] However, Ms
O’Reilly submitted an email sent to her by the body corporate manager on
28 January 2025 that said:
I had received a call from the Katherine
this morning advising she was the resident who cut down the branches as it was
still overhanging
and as she didn't have any gardening tools on her that's why
she broke the branches...
[7] However it
occurred, Ms O’Reilly’s photographs show that after the tree had
been further cut back by the contractor
nothing remained but a short, bare,
forked trunk, devoid of foliage. Ms O’Reilly says it has not sprouted
since, the trunk
has split, fungus is growing on it, and it is presumed
O’Reilly sent a
Form 1 Notice to body corporate of a contravention of a
body corporate by-law
to the committee on 25 February 2025 claiming Ms
Dempsey breached by-law 4.1:
to Lawns etc.
(1) The occupier of a lot must not,
without the body corporate’s written approval
(a) damage a lawn, garden, tree, shrub, plant or flower on the common
property...
[9] However, on
13 March the committee voted down a motion to issue Ms Dempsey with a continuing
contravention notice, with only Ms
O’Reilly voting in favour of it and
another committee member voting against.
Must the body corporate issue Ms Dempsey with a Form
[10] Assuming
that Ms Dempsey damaged the grevillea, is the body corporate obliged to issue
her with a by-law contravention notice?
One of the body corporate’s
functions is to enforce the
It must act reasonably in
the exercise of that function.
[11] If the body
corporate reasonably believes an owner is contravening the by-laws and is likely
to continue, it may issue a continuing
contravention notice (Form 10) to the
person requiring that they remedy the
contravention.
[12] Alternatively,
if the body corporate believes a person has contravened the by-laws and is
likely to repeat the contravention,
it may issue them with a future
contravention notice.
[13] There is no
indication that Ms Dempsey is continuing to damage the tree or is likely to
damage it again in future. The damage
is alleged to have occurred on a single
occasion in January 2025. In these circumstances, neither contravention notice
seems appropriate.
No enforcement of the by-law seems strictly necessary as the
by-law is no longer being infringed.
Must the body corporate replace the tree and recover the cost
from Ms Dempsey?
do not see that the body corporate is obliged to replace the grevillea. Ms
O’Reilly does not claim that the body corporate
damaged it.
[15] I do not
know the body corporate’s views on the grevillea. I gather the committee
is no longer functioning following some
resignations. Only Ms Dempsey made a
submission in response to the application. Given that the body corporate
recently paid a contractor
to trim trees back from the units, it may not wish to
reinstate a tree of similar dimensions in the same location.
[16] If the body
corporate wishes to plant a replacement tree in that location, it may. It is
responsible for the administration
of the common
Ms O’Reilly might
like to submit a motion to that effect to the committee or a general meeting.
If the motion was to pass,
the committee would be obliged to put it into
But otherwise I do not see
why the body corporate must reinstate a tree allegedly removed by an owner.
[17] I also do
not see the body corporate’s power to recover the cost of a new tree from
Ms Dempsey. The body corporate may
carry out work required of an owner and
recover it from the owner as a debt where the owner is obliged to perform the
work under:
(a) a provision of the Act or this regulation, including a provision requiring
an owner or occupier to maintain a lot included in
the scheme; or
(b) a notice given under another Act or a Commonwealth Act; or
(c) the community management statement, including the by-laws; or
(d) an adjudicator’s order; or
(e) the order of a court or QCAT.
[18] But none of
those criteria apply here. The by-laws require that owners do not damage trees
on the common property without body
corporate approval, but do not require
owners to replace them if damaged. An adjudicator might order Ms Dempsey to
replace the tree
under section 281 of the Act if the body corporate applied for
such an order, but that has not occurred. I cannot order Ms Dempsey
it in response to the present application for several reasons:
order can only be made under section 281 where an applicant’s property was
damaged by a contravention, but the tree is not
Ms O’Reilly’s
Dempsey is not the respondent, and
such order has been sought.
important factual questions would need to be resolved before orders could be
made in Ms O’Reilly’s favour.
Ms Dempsey denies damaging the
grevillea. Even if she did damage it, there is no evidence of the condition of
the grevillea after
it was first pruned by the contractor, and again after Ms
Dempsey damaged it. There is only a photograph of the tree before any
occurred, and again after the contractor allegedly cut it back a second time to
remove the damage done by Ms Dempsey. That
makes it difficult to gauge the
damage done by Ms Dempsey or conclude that the tree died because of her
questions might be resolved by making further inquiries, particularly of the
body corporate manager who claimed in an email
that Ms Dempsey admitted to
breaking branches with her hands, and the contractor who either saw Ms Dempsey
breaking the branches
or asked her to hold a branch while it was cut with a
[21] But I have
not made those inquiries for the reasons set out above. Namely, even if Ms
Dempsey did damage the tree, I am not
satisfied that the body corporate must
issue her with a continuing contravention notice, replace the tree itself, nor
that it could
recover the cost of replacing the tree from Ms Dempsey.
Consequently, the application is
