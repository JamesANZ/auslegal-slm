Park Owner: Sturt River Caravan Park
Residency commenced: 7 April 2008
Period of Agreement: Periodic
Rent: $155.00 per week

Sworn evidence was given in person by Sigfred Dannell the Manager of the
Sturt River Caravan Park.
The resident and anyone who lives at the premises were given notice of the
hearing. The resident was not at the hearing.
The resident is still in possession of the premises.
The Resident Park Tenancy Agreement comes under the Residential Park Act,
I accept that a notice of termination (Form A) dated 9 June 2008 was served
on the resident because of rent.
The notice of termination is correct. The resident did not pay the
outstanding rent by the due date. This terminated the agreement.
The rent is still only paid to 10 July 2008. Rent should be paid in
I have taken into account all the evidence and have decided that the resident
can stay in the premises but only if payments are made
as ordered. Due to the
resident's poor payment history he will be required to move out of the premises
if payments in clause 1 are
not made in full and on time.
ORDER (made under sections 68 and 119 of the Act):
residential tenancy agreement is reinstated on condition the resident:
$310.00 by 5:00PM on Friday 8 August 2008. If this payment is not made the

$310.00 by 5:00PM on Friday 15 August 2008. If this payment is not made the
resident must move out of the premises by 1:00PM
on Monday 18 August
$310.00 by 5:00PM on Friday 22 August 2008. If this payment is not made the
resident must move out of the premises by 9:00AM
on Monday 25 August
the above payments are made
then the resident must pay $310.00 on Friday 29
August 2008 and then every week until rent is one week in advance. If the
misses one of these payments in the next three months the landlord may
apply to the Tribunal to terminate the agreement without serving
a notice of
termination.
If the resident does not make payment 1(a) or (b) and does
not move out of the premises by the time stated
the landlord may lodge a
statutory declaration to that effect and an up-to-date rent record. If a Deputy
Registrar of the Tribunal
is satisfied that the payment was not made, the
bailiff will be instructed to evict anyone remaining at the premises without
If the resident does not make payment 1(c) and does not leave the
premises by the time stated

have the bailiff immediately evict anyone remaining at the premises.
