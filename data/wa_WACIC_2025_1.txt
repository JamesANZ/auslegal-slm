On 16 December 2024 I made an award of compensation in the amount of $75,000,

The offences
7 March 2023 the offender pleaded guilty on indictment before the District Court
to two counts of indecent dealing with a child
under 13 years and one count of
procure, encourage or incite a child under 13 years to engage in sexual
behaviour. The facts were
outlined by the prosecutor as follows:
[A]t the time of the offences, the victim was nine years of age
and the offender was 39 years of age. The offender and the victim
do not know
each other. The victim had stayed at her step grandparents’ in Doubleview
for a few days during the school holidays.
On Tuesday, 12 July 2022, just before
10 am, the victim asked to take her grandparents’ dog for a walk on her
own to the local
park, which was allowed.
After walking the dog in the park, the victim began to leave the park and
head towards her grandparents’ house when she was
approached by the
offender from behind. The offender said, “Hey kid, come here”. The
offender held the victim by her
hand and lured her by unknown means along the
The offender encouraged the victim by unknown means to come to his house. As
the offender and the victim walked past her grandparents’
pointed out the house and said that she needed to go home. The offender let go
of her hand while walking past her
grandparents’ home. The offender then
grabbed hold of the victim’s hand again and continued to walk her along
While they walked towards the offender’s home, the offender offered
the victim a burger from Hungry Jack’s, which he
was already in possession
of. The offender told the victim to hurry up as his house was only around the
corner. Once they arrived
at the offender’s home, the victim told the
offender she was leaving. The offender said he would give her a kiss goodbye and
then kissed the victim on the lips with a closed mouth.
The offender then grabbed the victim’s hand and took her upstairs to
his bedroom, along with the dog. Once in the offender’s
bedroom, the
offender told the victim to lay down on the bed. The victim did not lay down.
However, she sat on the end of the bed.
The offender used his hands and pushed
the victim on her chest to make her lay on the bed. The victim did not lay back
so the offender
stood in front of her and pulled her pants and underwear down.
The offender pulled his pants down and exposed his penis to the victim. The
offender used one of his hands to grab his penis and
squished it in front of the
While holding his penis, the offender asked the victim to suck his penis.
The victim told the offender that she was only 10 years
of age and was too young
to have sex.
The offender is under the care of the Public Advocate and at this time his
carer arrived at his home address and knocked on the door.
The victim used this
opportunity to pull her pants back up and run down the stairs. The victim ran
out of the house with the dog
and ran back to her step grandparents’
house. The victim then told her step grandmother what had

judgment of convictions were entered for the offences, I am satisfied proved
offences as defined in
Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 2003
(WA) (the Act) are constituted. I determined the application pursuant to
the Act which provides an assessor may make a compensation award if satisfied
the claimed injury and any claimed loss has occurred
and did so as a consequence
of the commission of a proved offence.
Evidence of injury
applicant’s claimed injury was mental and nervous shock.
3 August 2022 and 18 July 2023, the applicant attended 21 sessions with Clinical
Psychologist Zoe Pearce at the Parkerville
Children and Youth Care service. The
reports by Ms Pearce express an opinion the applicant experienced post-trauma
symptoms. These
symptoms included:
feeling scared;
avoidance of trauma reminders; nightmares; difficulty sleeping; flash backs;
somatic complaints; and feeling sad.
his victim impact statement dated August 2024, the applicant’s father
described the applicant as a ‘very happy, bubbly
outgoing girl’
before the offences who changed dramatically after the offences. He
She wasn’t her usual happy outgoing self. She was
more withdrawn, scared, very timid at times and confused with her emotions.
was a lot more guarded especially around males. She would often wake up in the
middle of the night crying and emotional.
her victim impact statement dated June 2024, the applicant’s grandmother
described the applicant as being ‘tearful,
crying, frightened and
confused’ after the incident. She also stated the applicant has become
withdrawn and unhappy and she
has issues with her sleep.
his letter, the applicant’s father stated that since the applicant was
discharged from her psychological treatment with
Parkerville, she now uses
avoidance to cope, has blocked memories of the offences and does not want to
talk about the offences. The
applicant’s father was concerned if the
applicant was required to participate in a comprehensive assessment for a formal
psychologist
report it would reopen the trauma and the applicant would find it
very challenging to open up and discuss the offences with a different
psychologist from her treating psychologist Ms Pearce.
of the Act sets out the general powers of an assessor. It provides ‘on
application in respect of injury suffered by a victim
as a consequence of the
commission of an offence, an assessor may award such compensation that the
assessor is satisfied is just
for the injury and for any loss also
suffered.’ Under
of the Act, ‘satisfied’ means
‘satisfied on the balance of probabilities’.
of the Act requires an assessor must determine compensation applications
expeditiously and informally having regard to the requirements
of justice and
the Act. An assessor is not bound by rules or practice as to evidence or
procedure but may inform themselves in any
manner they think fit.
assessing the amount of compensation, the assessor should have regard solely to
the injury actually suffered by the applicant
as a consequence of the commission
of the offence and not the seriousness of the offence. The amount of
compensation is not to be
fixed as punishment of the offender or as an
expression of sympathy for the
the actual facts of the offence are relevant as it is from the facts of the
offence that the assessor can make a decision
of the medical evidence and the likely time during which the applicant will
ordinary tortious principles apply for assessment of damages, subject to the
limitations imposed by the definitions of ‘injury’
‘loss’ in the Act, and to the jurisdictional limit of the
of the Act, the maximum amount of compensation payable is $75,000, as
the offences occurred after 1 January 2004, and are related
offences pursuant to
of the Act. This is a jurisdictional limit, not a sum reserved for the
worst cases.
assessing the appropriate amount of compensation, a broad and subjective
assessment must be undertaken, and the amount must be

of the Act requires an ‘assessor must not make a compensation
award for mental and nervous shock suffered by a victim as a
consequence of the
commission of an offence, or for any loss in respect of such shock, unless the
assessor is satisfied that the
victim was the person against whom the offence
was committed.’ The applicant in this case was the person against whom the
was committed.
Girardi v Chief
Assessor of Criminal Injuries
Compensation
Commissioner Schoombee set out the distinction between mental and nervous shock
under the Act and the common law requirement for
the diagnosis of a recognised
psychiatric illness:
In the law of tort damages are not
recoverable for distress, alarm, fear, anxiety, annoyance or despondency,
without any resulting
recognised psychiatric illness:
Tame v New South
Wales Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd
[2002] HCA 35
(2002) 211 CLR 317
[44], [171], [193] and [285]. However, in
Fagan v Crimes Compensation
(1982) 42 ALR 511
at 516–517 the High Court held in
respect of the words "mental or nervous shock" as referred to in the
Injuries Compensation Act 1972
that it was a mistaken approach to
suppose that this phrase was only concerned with the kind of injuries recognised
by the common
law as entitling a plaintiff to damages in tort. Mason and Wilson
JJ said that the words of the Act had to be interpreted without
supposing that
they were intended to copy or reproduce common law rules. It must therefore be
accepted that the phrase "mental or
nervous shock" does not necessarily require
proof of a psychiatric illness. Distress or anxiety which does not amount to a
psychiatric
illness would qualify as "mental or nervous shock", as long as it
can be proven to be a consequence of the impact of events constituting
offence. However, what is contemplated by the Act is not a mere emotional
reaction, but something of a more enduring character
which may, in both the
legal sense and in common parlance, be described as an injury:

Flynn DCJ referred to a number of cases where a finding of mental and
nervous shock was based upon the drawing of an inference from
evidence of
enduring emotional harm suffered by a victim including: ‘a grave emotional

the offences; her symptoms are enduring and considerably
impact her life.
Accordingly, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities the psychological
symptoms suffered by the applicant
amount to mental and nervous shock as a

further evidence
nor require the applicant to undergo a formal psychological or
psychiatric assessment.
