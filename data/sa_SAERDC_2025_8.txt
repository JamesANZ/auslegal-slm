CITY OF TEA TREE GULLY v GHAZZAWI
[2025] SAERDC 8
THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING JUDGMENT:
defendant Rabih Ghazzawi has pleaded guilty to two counts of undertaking a
development contrary to
section 215(1)
Planning, Development and
Infrastructure Act 2016
(‘the Act’)
maximum penalty applicable for each of those offences is a fine of $120,000. Due
to the timing of his pleas of guilty, he is
entitled to a legislative discount
of up to 40% of any penalty I impose.
29 August 2024, authorised officers of the informant went to the home of the
defendant and his wife at Modbury to investigate
suspected tree damaging
activity. The two trees of concern during that attendance and the subject of
this offending were two River
Red Gum trees or as they are botanically known,
Eucalyptus Camuldulensis. One tree was on the informant’s road reserve
to the defendant’s home (‘Tree 1’) and the other in
the front yard (‘Tree 2’).
roots of Tree 1 had been severed and its base shaved to accommodate a recently
erected fence. Tree 2 had a recent substantial
limb removal. Both trees were
significant trees for the purpose of the Act.
authorised officers spoke with the defendant as one of the owners of the house.
He admitted he had removed the root of Tree 1
to build a fence and that he had
removed the limb of Tree 2 to protect his children, who often played near it. He
told the officers
he was willing to protect his children regardless of the law.
informant engaged a consultant arborist who assessed both trees and provided an
affidavit to the court dated 14 March 2025. The
arborist confirmed the damage to
both trees was substantial and tree-damaging activities.
way of background to this offending, in June 2023, the defendant had an initial
discussion with the informant regarding removal
of both trees. Two months later,
he lodged a development application to “remove a tree...on private
property, to put up a fence
for the safety of [his] children.” The
defendant provided a hand-drawn diagram in support of that application. The
did not consider that diagram was sufficient for the purposes of its
assessment of the application under the Act and requested further
documentation
before the application could be finally considered. The defendant never provided
that further information.
defendant accepted he had been aware of the need to obtain authorisation to
remove those trees. He told me his offending had
occurred because he wanted to
make his front garden safe for his children. He considered Tree 2 to be
dangerous as a branch might
fall unless he pruned it as he did. He said the
damage to Tree 1 had been required to allow him to build a fence across the
of his property to better provide security for his family.
defendant was born in Lebanon. With his wife he has four children between 3 and
11. Those children mostly play outdoors in the
front garden.
defendant has worked as a welder and operates a small business doing retaining
walls, fencing and excavation work. He has a restricted
building licence.
wife does not work and cares full time for their children. The defendant’s
yearly income is about $180,000 before tax.
Family expenses- which include home
mortgage repayments, food, insurance, car payments, truck and business costs and
his children’s
extra-curricular activities- exhaust that income. The
defendant also provides for his parents. His brothers work for him in his
defendant has no antecedents.
offending was a misguided attempt to protect against a perceived risk to the
defendant’s family. He was, without justification,
frustrated as he
considered the regulating authority would not allow removal. That was of course
speculation on his part as he had
not provided the extra information sought.
Nonetheless, he was obliged to always act lawfully.
slightly guarded because of his pre-emptive unlawfulness, I do consider the
defendant has good prospects of rehabilitation.
He accepted this offending and I
consider the experience of criminal prosecution has already, and the imposition
of a fine will,
have the required rehabilitative effect.
determining penalty for environmental offending, the paramount consideration is
the protection of the safety of the community.
The Parliament has legislated a
system that allows for lawful tree removal in certain circumstances to protect
persons from harm
and preserve the environment for us all.
must also have regard to personal and general deterrence. It is important
members of the community adhere to the processes legislated
by the Parliament
regarding tree removal and do not act without authority. I must deter this
defendant and others from engaging
in similar offending. In this case, the
defendant had known since June 2023, the proper channels to go through to remove
is also the case that the limited resources of the informant had to be used to
deal with this offending which is often difficult
to detect. It was fortunate
that authorised officers were nearby and observed the damage to the trees.

submissions, the informant contended this offending was more serious, and of the
same type or nature, as offending in two recent
cases in this court involving
commercial tree loppers who were reckless to the need for approval.
offending though occurred after the making of an application, the failure to
provide further information and following an unwarranted
assumption the
application would not be granted. It was a misguided act of taking the process
into the defendant’s own hands.
It was motivated by a desire to deal with
a perceived risk of branches failing on his children and the desire for
heightened security
by installation of a front fence. The defendant knew he
needed approval.
commercial operators the motivation is payment of a fee to undertake work on
someone else’s property. The community rightly
expects a high standard of
behaviour from such persons who are in that business. Further, it is appropriate
in such cases to ensure

case is different and must be assessed on its own facts and in context and
having regard to the relevant sentencing principles
and the personal and
financial circumstances of the defendant. Given that, the sentences imposed in
the other cases to which the
informant referred have not been of much
assistance.
the offending regarding Tree 1, I adopt a starting point of a fine of $3,000
reduced by 40% to $1800.
the offending regarding Tree 2, I adopt a starting point of a fine of $3,000

Planning, and
Development and Infrastructure Act 2106
(SA) the defendant pay $7,881.50,
inclusive of GST, on account of expenses incurred by it resulting from the
contravention.
that respect the informant has established three types of costs have been
incurred to save the street tree from removal in an
amount totalling $7881.50.
First, the cost of a tree soil report about the extent of the root damage and
the implications for the
tree. Second, the cost of undertaking the
recommendations in that report and third, the cost of crown management pruning.
informant also seeks it legal costs and disbursements of $1,655.70.
respect of the payment of any pecuniary sum,
(SA) obliges me to consider the means of the defendant, so far
as they are known.
I do consider in all the circumstances that the payment of a pecuniary sum-
totalling the amount of a fine as I have already mentioned,
the costs incurred
as claimed and the legal costs as just detailed- would unduly prejudice the
welfare of the dependants of the defendant.
In that respect I accept but will
not repeat the financial circumstances of the defendant as detailed earlier.
am satisfied the imposition of a fine, costs and reimbursement would potentially
impact on the dependents of the defendant being
his wife, his children and his
parents. In all the circumstances I see fit to order payment of a lesser amount
than I would have
otherwise ordinarily ordered for payment.
fix a single fine for both offences of $3000. I order the defendant pay costs
incurred by the informant on account of the contravention
in the amount of
$3500. I order the defendant pay the costs of the informant fixed at $1500.
Those amounts totalling $8000 will be
payable to the informant.

counts) and court fees in the amount of
