resolving the question of whether an injured person is an “earner”
is an essential step in determining the amount of

benefits payable under Division 3.3 of the MAI Act; a dispute in relation to
“earner” falls
within Schedule 2 clause 1(a) of the MAI Act and is a
merit review matter; claimant is an “earner”; merit review decision
set aside; matter remitted to the insurer to determine the claimant’s
entitlements to weekly payments of statutory benefits
in accordance with
sections 3.6 and 3.7 of the MAI Act.
DETERMINATIONS MADE:
1. In relation to the merit review decision by a
single Merit Reviewer dated 23 February 2021, the Merit Review Panel sets aside
decision of the Merit Reviewer and finds that Mr Tran is an
“earner” for the purposes of s 3.6 and s 3.7 of the
Accident Injuries Act 2017
2. The matter is remitted to the insurer to determine Mr Tran’s
entitlements to weekly payments of statutory benefits in accordance
and s 3.7 of the MAI Act.
3. The Commission makes directions as set out in paragraph 16 of the
Panel’s reasons.
4. A brief statement of the Panel’s reasons for this determination
are attached to this Certificate.
1. Mr Tran suffered injury in a motor accident on 27
October 2020. He made an application for statutory benefits to the insurer dated
20 November 2020. On 11 December 2020, the insurer issued a notice to Mr
Tran admitting liability for payment of statutory benefits
for the first 26
weeks from the date of the accident. In a separate letter of the same date, the
insurer determined that Mr Tran
was not an “earner” for the purposes
of s 3.6 and s 3.7. Mr Tran sought an internal review of that decision. On 30
2020, the internal reviewer affirmed the insurer’s earlier
decision, finding that Mr Tran did not meet the definition of
and, as a consequence, he was not entitled to weekly
payments of statutory benefits.
2. Mr Tran was not satisfied with the insurer’s decision. He lodged an
application for merit review with the Dispute Resolution
Service. On 23 February
2021, the Merit Reviewer to whom the dispute was referred determined that the
dispute about whether Mr Tran
was an “earner” was not a merit review
matter as declared by Sch 2 of the
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
Act). The merit reviewer also determined that he could not make a calculation of
the amount of weekly payments to which Mr Tran
was entitled. He set aside the
internal review decision and remitted the matter to the insurer for
reconsideration.
3. The insurer lodged an application for review of the merit reviewer’s
decision by a review panel on 20 May 2021. That application
comes before us as
the Merit Review Panel constituted in accordance with s 7.15 of the MAI Act.
4. In short, the insurer argued that Mr Tran was not an “earner”
and that the Merit Reviewer erred in concluding that
he did not have
Tran’s position is that he was an
“earner” and that he is
entitled to be paid weekly payments in accordance with the MAI Act.
Teleconference
5. The Panel convened a teleconference on 1 September 2021. Mr Tran
represented himself and Mr Blayney attended for the insurer.
6. The purpose of convening the teleconference was to consider the
information and documents supplied by the parties and to explore
resolution of the issues or at least some of the issues.
7. Mr Tran provided documents including his bank records for the period 16
May 2020 to 15 November 2020.
8. The Panel informed the parties that it considered it did have jurisdiction
to decide the issue of whether Mr Tran was an “earner”
as defined by
Sch 1 cl 2 of the MAI Act for the purposes of determining his entitlement to
weekly payments in accordance with s 3.6
9. During the teleconference, by reference to his
bank statements, Mr Tran confirmed that sums credited to his account on 4
2020 ($480), 8 October 2020 ($420), 12 October 2020 ($200) and 17
October 2020 ($222) were wages paid to him by George Maloukis for
security work.
10. Mr Tran stated that he had also received some payments for security work
on a ‘cash in hand’ basis and that he declared
those funds.
11. In light of Mr Tran’s evidence about his earnings, the insurer was
asked whether it was prepared to concede that Mr Tran
“earner” on the basis that he was employed during the eight weeks
immediately preceding the motor
Mr Blayney sought time to
obtain instructions in relation to this matter. The Panel agreed to this request
and reserved its decision.
Determination
12. In order to establish an entitlement to weekly payments of statutory
benefits under s 3.6 and s 3.7, an injured person must establish
are an “earner”, as defined in Sch 1 cl 2 of the MAI Act. In this
regard, s 3.6 and s 3.7 are, relevantly,
in the following terms:
Weekly payments during first
entitlement period (first 13 weeks after motor accident)
(1) An earner who is injured as a result of a motor accident and
suffers a total or partial loss of earnings as a result of the
entitled to weekly payments of statutory benefits under this section during the
first entitlement period.
Only a person who was an earner when injured is entitled to statutory
benefits under this section—see Schedule 1.
Weekly payments during second entitlement
period (weeks 14–78 after motor accident)
(1) An earner who is injured as a result of a motor accident and
suffers a total or partial loss of earnings as a result of the
entitled to weekly payments of statutory benefits under this section during the
second entitlement period.
Only a person who was an earner when injured is entitled to statutory
benefits under this section—see Schedule 1.
13. The Panel finds that resolving the question of whether an injured person
is an “earner” is an essential step in determining
the amount of
weekly payments of statutory benefits payable, if any, under Div 3.3,
specifically s 3.6 and s 3.7. That being the
case, we have concluded that a
dispute in relation to “earner” falls within Sch 2 cl 1(a) of the
MAI Act and is a merit
review matter.
14. On 7 September 2021 the insurer informed the Commission that it accepted
that the claimant was an “earner”.
15. Having found that the Panel had jurisdiction to determine the issue of
whether Mr Tran was an “earner” as defined
by Sch 1 cl 2 of the MAI
Act for the purposes of determining his entitlement to weekly payments, and the
insurer having now conceded
that the claimant was an “earner”, the
Panel makes the following orders:
relation to the merit review decision by a single Merit
Reviewer dated 23 February 2021, the Merit Review Panel sets aside the
of the single Merit Reviewer and finds
Mr Tran is an
“earner” for the purposes of s 3.6 and s 3.7 of the MAI Act.
(b) The matter is remitted to the insurer to determine Mr Tran’s
entitlements to weekly payments of statutory benefits in accordance
and s 3.7 of the MAI Act.
16. To facilitate the payment of Mr Tran’s weekly payment entitlements
under Div 3.3, the Panel makes the following directions:
1. Within 14 days of the date of this decision Mr Tran is to provide the
insurer with the following information and documents:
(i) An explanation of the documents from Woolworths provided by Mr Tran
(document AD 7 in the Commission portal).
(ii) If the documents from Woolworths relate to hours of work, Mr Tran is to
provide the insurer all documents relating to his earnings
from Woolworths and
his period of employment with Woolworths from 1 July 2019 – 31 December
(iii) A legible copy of his ATO tax return for the financial year ending
30 June 2020.
(iv) Copies of his ATO tax return and Notice of Assessment for the financial
year ending 30 June 2021 if available.
2. If the information Mr Tran is required to provide the insurer in
compliance with direction 1 is not provided or not fully provided
within 21 days
of the date of this decision, the
insurer is to determine Mr Tran’s
entitlements to weekly payments of statutory benefits on the basis of the
information available
to the Insurer at that time.
