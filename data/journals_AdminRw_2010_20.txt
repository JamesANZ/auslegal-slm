The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
The Environment Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act
On 31 October 2008 the Hon. Peter Garrett, then Minister for the Environment,
Heritage and the Arts, commissioned an independent review
Environment
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
. The review is a statutory
requirement provided for by
of the Act. The review was carried out
by Dr Allan Hawke, who released an interim report on 3 August 2009. The report
nominated a
number of areas for additional consideration but made no conclusions
or recommendations. Among the main areas for further consideration
• the purpose of the Act
• the division and harmonisation of responsibilities for the environment
between the Commonwealth and the states and territories
• the appropriateness of the current matters of national environmental
significance as triggers under the Act and proposals
for the inclusion of
additional triggers
• alternative approaches to biodiversity conservation
• improved arrangements for performance auditing and
compliance—including for regional forest agreements and other bilateral
• the scope for review of decisions made under the Act
• opportunities for streamlining environmental
regulation.
On 30 October 2009 Dr Hawke presented his
final report—
The Australian Environment Act: report of the Independent
Review of the
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
—to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, who
tabled it in parliament, as required by
of the Act, on 21 December.
The report recommends an integrated package of reforms, including the
• establishing an independent Environment Commission to advise government
on project approvals, strategic assessments, bioregional
plans and other
statutory decisions
• streamlining approvals processes through earlier engagement in planning
and providing for more effective use of and greater
reliance on strategic
assessments, bioregional planning and approvals, and bilateral agreements
• creating a new matter of national environmental significance for
‘ecosystems of national significance’ and introducing
greenhouse trigger
• improving transparency in decision making and providing greater access
to the courts for public interest litigation.
