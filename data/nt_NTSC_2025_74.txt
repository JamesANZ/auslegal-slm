CORAM: GRANT CJ
EDITED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
on 8 October 2025)
[1] The accused
is charged with the murder of the deceased on 6 July 2023. Manslaughter is
charged in the alternative. In brief compass,
the Crown case is that on 6 July
2023 the accused and the deceased were drinking together. They started arguing.
During that argument
the deceased punched the accused in the head three times.
The accused then threatened to get a knife and stab the deceased. He walked
the kitchen, picked up a knife and stabbed the victim in the upper back despite
their adult daughter’s attempt to stand
between them.
[2] By amended
notice dated 7 October 2025, the Crown advised its intention to adduce hearsay
evidence of previous representations
made by the deceased pursuant to
Evidence (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011
). The Crown submits that if those previous representations
fall within the exception to the hearsay rule they are admissible as
relationship
or context evidence. The Crown also intends to adduce evidence from
the adult daughter concerning the relationship between the accused
deceased. The preliminary questions for determination are: (1) whether the
representations made by the deceased fall within
the exception under
; (2) if so, whether those representations and
the adult daughter’s evidence are
prima facie
relevant and
admissible as relationship or context evidence; and (3) if so, whether the
evidence must nevertheless be excluded under
Sections 65(2)(b)
and (c) of the
The hearsay rule does not apply
to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw,
heard or otherwise perceived
the representation being made, if the
representation:
(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in
circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation
is a fabrication;
(c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the
representation is reliable;
representations which the Crown intends to adduce are:
(a) representations made by the deceased in a statutory declaration taken before
a police officer on 16 October 2021, approximately
21 months before the incident
for which the accused now stands
(b) representations made by the deceased to her daughter during the events which
took place on 6 July 2023 culminating in the death
of the deceased.
[5] Turning
first to the statutory declaration on 16 October 2021, it states that at
approximately 11 PM on 14 October 2021 the accused
grabbed the deceased by the
hair with his left hand and punched her twice in the face with his right fist
causing her to fall to
the ground. The statutory declaration states further that
at some unspecified time on 15 October 2021 the accused elbowed the deceased
the left shoulder on two occasions causing her to fall onto her back. While the
deceased was on her back, the accused grabbed
her by the hair with his left hand
and forced two fingers into the left side of the deceased’s mouth causing
her pain. The
statutory declaration also makes a general reference to violence
in the relationship.
Section 65(2)(b)
provides an exception for representations made
‘shortly after’ the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that
it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication. The representations
relate to conduct alleged to have occurred on 14 and 15
October 2021. Although
the phrase ‘shortly after’ imports a degree of
flexibility
, the Federal Court has
observed that it would be an unusual case in which a representation made five
days after an event might be
regarded as having been made ‘soon
. That is so even in
circumstances where the events might be considered still ‘fresh’ in
the memory of the person making
the representations. Even allowing for that
caution, in my opinion the statements made somewhere between 24 and 36 hours
incident in question are properly characterised as made ‘shortly
after’ the asserted fact occurred in the relevant
[7] There is
nothing in the bare surrounding circumstances or in the representations
themselves which would suggest that they were
a fabrication. They were made upon
the very recent memory of the incident when the matter was fresh in the mind of
the person making
those statements. There is nothing to preclude a finding that
the circumstances made it unlikely that the representations were a
fabrication.
[8] Accordingly,
I conclude that the representations in the statutory declaration were made
‘shortly after’ the event
in the sense that they were made
‘under the proximate pressure of the asserted
, and in circumstances
that make it unlikely that they are a fabrication. The accused does not make any
contrary submission.
conclusion makes it unnecessary to determine whether the representations
contained in the statutory declaration fall within
the exception provided by
. The relevant question under that provision
is whether the representations were made in circumstances making it
‘highly probable’
they are reliable. The focus of that inquiry is
reliability rather than the unlikelihood of fabrication having regard to the
surrounding
circumstances.
quite different considerations, and the test in
is less stringent than that in
s 65(2)(c).
Although the
deceased was intoxicated to varying degrees when each of the incidents took
place, she was treated at the community
clinic in the aftermath of each incident
and photographs of her injuries were taken. In addition, the statutory
declaration was made
during the course of a formal interview with police. It is
significant in assessing the probability of reliability that the statutory
declaration was given to police on oath. Notwithstanding the greater stringency
of the test, I am also prepared to find that the
representations contained in
the statutory declaration were made in circumstances making it highly probable
that they are reliable.
Again, the accused does not make any contrary
submission.
[10] Turning
then to the daughter’s evidence, it is that a short time prior to the
fatal incident she heard her parents arguing.
She went inside to try to stop
them from arguing. She saw the accused was sitting down and the deceased was
upset and saying that
the accused had punched her in the forehead. That
representation was also made ‘shortly after’ the asserted fact
and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a
fabrication, and therefore falls within the exception provided
. The accused also does not make any contrary
submission in that respect.
[11] It does
necessarily not follow from those conclusions that either category of evidence
is therefore admissible. There is the
anterior question of relevance. That
hearsay evidence is only admissible if it is relevant.
provides that evidence will only be relevant if it could rationally
affect, either directly or indirectly, the assessment of the
probability of the
existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. That term ‘fact in
issue’ also appears in the definition
of ‘probative value’ in
the Dictionary. On an initial consideration, a ‘fact in issue’ might
be seen as a
reference to the facts which constitute the elements of the
offences charged, together with such ancillary facts as are relevant
ultimate facts, as opposed to a fact which is in
[12] However, in
Stubley v Western Australia
the High Court held that in circumstances where the appellant had admitted that
he had been sexually intimate with the complainants
the question whether sexual
intercourse had taken place was not a live issue at the trial and the fact in
issue was whether the sexual
acts were consensual. Accordingly, evidence
demonstrating the appellant’s tendency to have sex with his patients was
significance because the evidence that sexual intercourse had taken place
was not challenged. Similarly, in
Larsen v Director of Public Prosecutions
, the Victorian Court
of Appeal determined that where the allegation of sexual intercourse was
admitted, the ‘fact in issue’
was the existence, or non-existence,
in the appellant’s mind of a belief that the complainant was over 16, not
whether the
offending conduct had occurred at all. The same approach to what
constitutes a ‘fact in issue’ was adopted by the Court
of Criminal
Appeal of New South Wales in of
Geraghty v The
[13] On those
authorities, the assessment of the probative value of tendency evidence turns on
the ultimate facts which the prosecution
will be required to prove and the
evidence that the prosecution will be required to lead in doing so. They do not
approach the assessment
on the basis that every fact going to the elements of
the offence, whether contested or not, is a ‘fact in issue’.
those authorities are concerned specifically with whether tendency
evidence would have ‘significant probative value’,
the analysis of
what will constitute a ‘fact in issue’ in the context of a criminal
trial has an arguably broader application.
However, for reasons I will come to
it is unnecessary to resolve that question for present purposes.
is no dispute that the accused stabbed the deceased causing her death. The
issues in dispute are whether the accused had the
requisite intent either to
cause the death of or serious harm to the deceased and/or whether the conduct
causing death was the result
of the accused’s loss of self-control induced
by the deceased’s conduct. Against that background, the Crown contends
that the evidence identified in the notice is relevant and admissible as
relationship or context evidence. Relationship evidence
will be admissible if
it is capable of providing context to the Crown’s
allegations,
(a) as essential background against which the evidence of the complainant and
the accused necessarily falls to be evaluated, to show
the continuing nature of
the conduct, and to explain the offences
(b) to ensure that the jury is not required to decide issues in a vacuum, and to
overcome any false impression that the event was
an isolated one, or that the
offence happened ‘out of the blue’, in circumstances where the acts
disclosed in the relationship
evidence are closely and inextricably mixed up
with the history of the
(c) to assess the credibility or coherence of a complainant’s
(d) to explain why a complainant has made a delayed complaint to witnesses
and/or the police;
(e) to prove that the accused had a motive to commit the acts
(f) to negative issues concerning lawfulness (such as the question of intention,
consent or mistake).
relationship or context evidence to be relevant it must be shown that the
evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the
probability of an
allegation against the accused which is in issue in the proceeding. If the
relationship or context evidence does
tend to assist the choice between two
alternative explanations of the occurrence which are asserted by the parties,
then it will
be relevant and
prima facie
admissible. The overarching
purpose of relationship or context evidence is to place the accused’s
alleged conduct and/or state
of mind within the surrounding events or a series
of incidents which form part of a chain of events. For that reason, evidence of
that type will generally need to have a sufficiently close temporal connection
with the incident giving rise to the
As with purported
tendency evidence, purported relationship evidence will also lose its relevance
and probative force if the prior
occasions of which evidence is sought to be
tendered are remote in point of time to the act(s)
[16] The first
category of relationship evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce in this case
relates to two incidents which occurred
approximately 21 months prior to the
events the subject of the murder charge. That isolation and lack of temporal
proximity is such
that the two separate occasions cannot be said to form a chain
of events within which the assessment of the accused’s alleged
and/or state of mind in July 2023 properly falls to be assessed by the jury.
That is so regardless of whether the facts in
issue extend to the conduct
alleged or are more narrowly confined to murderous intent and provocation.
[17] Even were
that not so, the evidence does not serve any of the recognised purposes of
relationship evidence. The purpose of the
evidence is not to assist in
establishing that the accused stabbed the deceased by demonstrating that the
stabbing did not come out
of the blue. There is no dispute that the accused
stabbed the deceased. The only recognised purpose which the first category of
relationship
evidence might potentially serve relates to negativing issues
concerning lawfulness. However, this first category of relationship
cannot inform either the accused’s intent to cause the death of or serious
harm to the deceased and/or whether the
conduct causing death was the result of
the accused’s loss of self-control induced by the deceased’s
[18] The fact
that the accused has previously been involved in violent incidents in which he
has punched or elbowed the deceased cannot
rationally affect the assessment of
the probability concerning his intention or state of self-control during the
conduct charged.
Neither of the previous incidents identified by the Crown
involved serious harm or death, neither of them involved the use of a weapon
neither of them involved threats to kill the deceased. Quite apart from those
distinctions, this is not a case in which the accused’s
intention or state
of mind during incidents which took place some 21 months previously can afford
any insight into his intention
or state of mind on 6 July 2023. There is no
process of reasoning by which a jury could legitimately take those incidents
into account
for the purpose of determining that on this occasion the accused
intended to kill or cause serious harm to the deceased, or that
on this occasion
the accused did not lose self-control as the result of some conduct by the
deceased. For those same general reasons,
the adult daughter’s evidence
that there had previously been arguments and incidents of violence in the
relationship between
the accused and the deceased is also not relevant.
conclusion makes it unnecessary to determine whether the probative value of this
first category of relationship evidence
is outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice to the accused and must therefore be excluded by operation of
. Even if I am wrong in my assessment of the
evidence as irrelevant, its probative value would be so slight relative to its
prejudicial
effect as to require exclusion.
evidence of the representations made by the deceased to her daughter during the
events which took place on 6 July 2023 culminating
in the death of the deceased
falls into an entirely different category. On proper characterisation, that
evidence is not context
or relationship evidence at all. It is evidence of
conduct closely related in time and circumstance to the conduct alleged in the
charges, and forms part of the general narrative of events. This transactional
evidence has potential relevance both to the accused’s
state of mind at a
particular time proximate to the time of the
and to the question of
provocation. It will be a matter for the jury to determine whether the
accused’s conduct as described
in that evidence evinces any particular
state of mind and what inferences should properly be drawn from that conduct
when taken together
with the other evidence. The probative value of the evidence
for those purposes is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
[21] The rulings
on the matters for preliminary determination are:
(a) that the representations made by the deceased in a statutory declaration
taken before a police officer on 16 October 2021 are
inadmissible;
(b) that the evidence of Lilymay John identified at page 4 of the transcript of
interview conducted on 7 July 2023 and at pages 9
to 11 and 33 to 35 of the
transcript of interview conducted on 1 November 2023 is inadmissible;
(c) that the representations made by the deceased to Lilymay John during the
events which took place on 6 July 2023 culminating in
the death of the deceased
are admissible.
