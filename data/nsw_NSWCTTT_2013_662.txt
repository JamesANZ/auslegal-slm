GEN 12/48963
Valleys to Plateau Community Support Services Inc
RESPONDENT:
Graham Parker
2 August 2013
APPLICATION:
Applicants claim for compensation for alleged defective building inspection
APPEARANCES:
Mr Slade for applicant, Mr Love for respondent
Compensation, building inspection
1. The application is dismissed.
REASONS FOR DECISION
matter was heard at Coffs Harbour on 2 August 2013 when the evidence was taken
and the matter was then adjourned to enable each
party to make written
submissions which were ordered to be provided by 30 September 2013. The
applicant provided written submissions
in accordance with the Tribunals
directions however the respondent did not provide its written submissions until
the 22 October 2013.
this application the applicant consumer sought payment of the sum of $30,000.00
from the respondent supplier of building consultancy
services arising from what
was alleged to be a defective pre purchase building inspection report provided
by the respondent to the
applicant in September 2010 prior to the applicant
purchasing a residence at Nambucca Heads in northern New South Wales.
applicant was represented at the hearing by Mr Slade and the respondent by Mr
Love solicitor who appeared by leave of the Tribunal
which had been granted
earlier. Mr Dube and Mr Slade gave evidence as did the applicant’s expert
Mr Frank on behalf of the
applicant. The applicant also relied upon documents
that were admitted into evidence without objection. The respondent gave evidence
as did Mr Barnes the respondent’s expert.
was clear that the applicant had purchased the residence pursuant to a contract
dated 22 September 2010 and that prior to that
purchase the respondent had
provided a pre purchase building inspection report dated 2 September 2010 which
described the jetty which
was one of the improvements on the property as
“well-constructed and in good condition”.
The applicant
relied upon this report in purchasing the residence. It appears that the
applicant also obtained a pest inspection
report which they relied upon in
purchasing the residence. This report was not put into evidence. It was asserted
that that report
only related to the residence and not the jetty.
report commented upon the whole of the residence which was described as
“comprising 4 bedrooms, large open plan living areas and having a
space lock up garage and having direct internal access. A separate
double garage with brick walls another double steel garage as well
machinery shed with sliding door access.”
report at page 4 states that it does not and cannot make comments upon the
presence or absence of timber pests. The report at
page 3 sets out in detail the
scope and limitations of the report and makes it clear that it is a visual
inspection only.
respondent’s evidence was that at the time of inspection he walked on the
jetty that it was sound under foot and that the
decking boards were in place at
the time of his inspection on 2 September 2010. He maintained that the jetty was
accurately described
as well constructed and in good condition upon his visual
inspection. The respondent’s evidence was that he advised the applicant
obtain a pest inspection report.
September 2011 some 12 months after the applicants had entered into the contract
for sale and some 12 months after the respondent’s
inspection and report,
the applicants asked Mr Frank a licensed builder to carry out some work on the
jetty to upgrade it and make
it safe. Clearly the applicant at this time
realised that the jetty was in need of some maintenance and the inference is
applicant was aware of this at the time it purchased the residence.
Significantly Mr Frank then carried out a visual inspection and
ordered some
materials which he subsequently invoiced the applicant for in the sum of
$1,965.58. Those materials consisted of 200x
75 hardwood bearers 90x 35 kiln
dried hardwood decking 35/3.300 and 1 box of marine grade screws. Mr Frank then
carried out a further
inspection when he discovered the presence of termites and
subsequently prepared his dilapidation report which was relied upon by
applicant. This report identified a number of alleged defects in the jetty
going beyond the presence of termites. Mr Frank confirmed
the opinions expressed
in the report in his evidence. Mr Frank also submitted a quotation in the sum
of $34,463.00 to carry out
the remedial works he claimed were necessary. It was
only after Mr Frank’s second inspection that the applicant complained
the respondent.
Charles Barnes an engineer of over 40 years standing with experience in jetty
construction provided an expert report following
an inspection of the structure
in April 2013. He confirmed the opinions expressed in that report in his
evidence. Mr Barnes asserted
that it was correct to describe the jetty as well
constructed and that the structure remains in good condition notwithstanding
a small but significant number of the deck planks needed replacing. He also
expressed the opinion that the work quoted for by Mr
Frank included additional
items outside the original structure and did not recognise those members of the
structure which continued
to function.
applicant bears the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities. The Tribunal
prefers the evidence given by experienced expert
engineer Mr Barnes to that
given by Mr Frank. The Tribunal finds that the applicant must have been aware
that the jetty was in need
of some remedial work when it purchased the property
as is shown by Mr Frank being asked to do some work. The Tribunal is not
on the balance of probabilities that the respondent could have or
should have detected the presence of termites upon his visual inspection.
Significantly Mr Frank did not detect the presence of termites on his first
visual inspection. Further the report itself specifically
points out that the
report does not comment upon the presence or absence of timber pests. The
Tribunal is not persuaded on the balance
of probabilities having regard to its
acceptance of Mr Barnes evidence that the jetty was not accurately described as
well constructed
and in good condition at the time of the respondent’s
visual inspection in September 2010. In those circumstances the Tribunal
dismiss the application.
respondent sought in its submissions an order for costs. Contrary to that
submission the amount sought by the applicant as is
shown by the application has
always been $30,000.00. The general rule in the Tribunal is that each party
bears its own costs. Where
the amount claimed is $30,000.00 the Tribunal can
only award costs in exceptional circumstance unless the provisions of
Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Act 2001
doesn’t apply and the Tribunal can see no exceptional circumstances.
Accordingly each party must bear their own costs
in accordance with the general
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal
