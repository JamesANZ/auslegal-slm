declarations of capacity by BJ and KLD to be withdrawn.
The application for the

administrators from the funds of KLD that had been incurred by KS defending an
application for a protection

[7] On 27 February 2009 the appointment of the administrators was extended for
three months. On 17 March 2009 CS and KS lodged an

2009 the registry of

Does BJ have
standing to bring an application about KLD?
[13] In her written evidence to the Tribunal, BJ has stated that she met KLD in
February 2007 and a friendship developed between
them. She gave evidence that
she had paid a variety of living expenses for KLD on the basis that she would be
repaid by him. From
[14] In a written statement to the Tribunal dated 26 February 2008 BJ set out
particulars of the amount of money she had expended
on behalf of KLD. She had
asked the Tribunal at a hearing on 28 February 2008 to direct the administrators
of KLD to pay her the
money she claimed was owing to her by KLD. The Tribunal
did not make such a direction.
[15] About 19 April 2008 BJ relocated to Stanthorpe. KLD returned to reside at
his own home. An incident occurred on 15 July 2008
that is described in the
written statement of GP who is a neighbour of KLD. GP stated that KLD
telephoned him late in the evening
of that date and asked for help as BJ had
thrown a beer can at him. GP went to KLD’s house and observed a chaotic
scene where
there was beer over the floor, BJ was unable to stand up and she was
acting abusively. Police officers arrived at the house shortly
afterwards and
removed BJ from KLD’s house. GP was told by KLD that he had experienced
chest pains during the incident on 15
[16] In her written evidence to the Tribunal, BJ states that she lost her temper
and threw an empty can at KLD in the incident on
15 July 2008.
[17] In written evidence by KS, it was revealed that KLD successfully obtained a
Protection Order against BJ in the Magistrates Court
following this incident
that prohibits BJ from having any contact with KLD. The Protection Order
remains in place until 12 August
2010. The Tribunal was told that contrary to
the terms of the Protection Order BJ contacted KLD in October 2008 following
KLD filed a complaint with the police against BJ.
[18] The Tribunal was told that KLD was terrified of BJ and he becomes very
distressed whenever her name is mentioned. KLD swore
an affidavit on 30 October
2008 in which he deposed that he had no desire to have any contact whatsoever
with BJ and that he considered
it necessary to have the Protection Order remain
[19] In her written submissions on whether she was an interested person in terms
of the Act, BJ set out the following:
(a) She had met KLD on 12 February 2007;
(b) On 15 February 2007 (sic) his children were appointed as his
administrators;
(c) The administrators have failed to consult with KLD as to his wishes;
(d) KLD was a very lonely man when she met him;
(e) KLD, with her help, embarked on an active social life;
(f) KLD stayed at her house as a guest, rent free, until she relocated her
(g) She had cared for him during this time as she had also done for her late
(h) She drove KLD everywhere in his car;
(i) She took him to his doctor’s consultations;
(j) She acted as an unpaid carer and driver for KLD;
(k) These facts qualify her to be a person entitled to be interested in KLD and
his welfare.
[20] The Tribunal accepts that BJ became a friend of KLD in February 2007 and
that the friendship continued until at least 15 July
2008. The Tribunal finds
that the friendship came to an end after the incident, admitted by BJ, in which
she assaulted KLD on 15
[21] The Tribunal finds that KLD applied for a Protection Order to prevent BJ
from having any contact with him. The Tribunal accepts
the evidence of KS that
KLD is frightened of BJ and that KLD made a complaint to the police after BJ
terms of the Protection Order in October 2008.
The Tribunal accepts the evidence of KLD himself that he does not want to have
[22] BJ on the other hand contends that she remains a friend of KLD and
interested in his welfare although she has had no contact
with him for over a
year. A friendship is a relationship between two or more persons in which
mutual feelings of affection are shared
for each other. It is axiomatic that a
friendship cannot exist unilaterally. The Tribunal finds that contrary to the
made by BJ in her applications to the Tribunal, she has not been a
friend of KLD since July 2008.
[23] After making that finding, the Tribunal examined the information set out in
support of the current applications made by BJ to
ascertain whether BJ could
nevertheless be a person with a sufficient and continuing interest in KLD
despite not being a friend,
relative or current carer of KLD. In her
application for directions lodged in May 2009, BJ seeks to enforce what she
describes as
her right to recover moneys claimed to have been expended by her on
behalf of KLD in 2007 and 2008. In her application for review
appointment of the administrators BJ repeats her demand for payment of $20,000
but also seeks “assurance that KLD is
well and continuing the lifestyle of
his choice”.
[24] It is evident from an examination of the documents provided to the Tribunal
that the ongoing interest that BJ has in KLD is
contingent on the recovery of
money that she claims is owed to her. She has expressly stated in her
application that if she cannot
“receive restitution and justice” via
her review application she will have to take further legal action to recover the
moneys claimed by her together with unspecified damages. The Tribunal considers
that BJ has demonstrated a desire to further her
own interests by bringing the
applications and has not demonstrated any objective interest in KLD.
[25] In earlier cases
Tribunal has examined whether an applicant has a sufficient and ongoing interest
in another person, it has been considered
that the relevant interest must be a
concern for the welfare (emotional, financial or otherwise) of the other person.
The Tribunal
is satisfied that in the circumstances of this case BJ, despite
seeking assurances about KLD’s health, has not demonstrated
any objective
concern for the welfare of KLD. She is not a friend of KLD, she has no right to
information about his current circumstances
and she is subject to a legal
prohibition from having any contact with him until August 2010.
[26] If the applications lodged by BJ proceed, KLD will continue to be involved
against his will with a person of whom he is frightened.
Such a position cannot
be in his interests or further his welfare. The Tribunal must have regard to
the General Principles when
exercising power under the Act. In accordance with
General Principle 7(4) the Tribunal is required to make decisions in a way
with the adult’s proper care and protection. The Tribunal is
satisfied that it would not be consistent with KLD’s proper
protection to facilitate proceedings involving KLD and BJ.
[27] The Tribunal is satisfied that BJ did not have an ongoing and sufficient
interest in KLD in terms of the Act at the time she
lodged her applications with
the Tribunal in May and June 2009. The Tribunal concludes that she did not have
standing to lodge these
proceedings about KLD in this Tribunal and that in the
particular circumstances of this case she will not have standing to lodge
further applications about KLD while she is neither a friend nor carer of KLD.
[28] The Tribunal dismissed the applications of BJ on the ground that the
applications have not been made by an interested person
as required by
subsection 115(2) of the Act.
