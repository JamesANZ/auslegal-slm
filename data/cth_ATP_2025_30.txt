INTRODUCTION
Panel, Bruce Cowley (sitting President), Ruth Higgins SC, and Kierin Deeming,
declined to conduct proceedings on an application
by a shareholder in relation
to the affairs of Twinza Oil Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed). The
application concerned
a proposed creditors’ scheme of arrangement whereby
certain secured creditors of Twinza would acquire voting power of 85% in
by way of a debt-for-equity swap, and the voting power of the ordinary and
preference shareholders of Twinza would be diluted
to 5% and 10% respectively.
WM Clough submitted that the effect of the circumstances was to provide control
of Twinza to its secured
creditors without the ordinary shareholders of Twinza
being given any opportunity either to participate in the transaction or vote
to whether the transaction should be approved, contrary to the purposes set out
in paragraphs 602(a), (b), and (c).
The Panel declined to conduct proceedings on the basis that it considered that
the Court was the more appropriate forum to decide
the issues raised by the

WM Clough Pty Ltd
is an unlisted public company with approximately 188 ordinary shareholders and
56 preference shareholders. It is pursuing
an offshore gas project in Papua New
Guinea, but it is in substantial debt. As at 31 May 2025, Twinza owed
approximately US$324
million in outstanding debt to its various senior lenders.
(approximately 92%) of this amount was owed to the Tor Funds, which are managed
by Tor Investment Management (Hong Kong) Limited.
The remainder was owed to the
Other Senior Lenders.
Clough is an ordinary shareholder of Twinza, having a voting power of
approximately 27.63% in Twinza.

Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd as receivers and managers

(a) the Scheme Creditors would provide a release of up to 92% of the senior
debt, reducing it from approximately US$324 million to
US$30 million
(b) in exchange for the partial release of the debt, there would be an issue of
ordinary shares in Twinza to the Scheme Creditors
so that, following the
implementation of the Scheme, the Scheme Creditors would hold 85% of the total
number of Twinza shares
(c) the convertible redeemable preference shares on issue would be replaced with
ordinary shares in Twinza so that, following the
implementation of the Scheme,
the convertible redeemable preference shareholders would hold 10% of the total
number of Twinza shares
(d) existing shareholders would retain the remaining 5% of Twinza shares on
issue following the implementation of the Scheme.
25 February 2025, the receivers and managers of Twinza delegated certain of
their powers in relation to the day-to-day management
of Twinza to its
10 April 2025, the receivers and managers of Twinza lodged with ASIC a Report on
Company Activities and Property (
). The ROCAP valued the assets of
Twinza at between US$458 million and US$528 million (both values being greater
than the approximately
US$324 million owed by Twinza to the Scheme Creditors).
24 June 2025, BDO Corporate Finance Australia Pty Ltd, which had been engaged by
Twinza, provided its independent expert’s
report in relation to the Scheme
Independent Expert’s Report
). The Independent Expert’s
Report valued the assets of Twinza, in the event the Scheme does not proceed, at
between US$179
million and US$254 million in a low and high scenario
respectively (both values being less than the approximately US$324 million
by Twinza to the Scheme Creditors).
5 August 2025, ASIC wrote to Twinza in relation to the Scheme, advising
ASIC does not propose to appear to make submissions,
or intervene to oppose the Scheme, at the first court hearing under subsection
411(1) of the Act.
ASIC does not intend at the first court hearing or the second court
hearing to provide a statement under paragraph 411(17)(b) of the
Act. We note
that ASIC's policy on when it will provide such a statement in Regulatory Guide
60: Schemes of arrangement refers to
ASIC being satisfied that a compromise or
arrangement has not been proposed for the purpose of enabling any person to
avoid the operation
of any of the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Act. This
issue is not a relevant consideration in the context of this Scheme, which

has occurred whether we intend to make submissions

if thought fit, agree to the

APPLICATION
Declaration sought
application dated 20 August 2025, WM Clough sought a declaration of unacceptable
circumstances. WM Clough submitted that:
(a) the effect of the circumstances was to dilute the voting power of the
ordinary shareholders of Twinza “
from 100% to 5% while providing
control of Twinza to the secured creditors of Twinza without the ordinary
shareholders of Twinza being
given any opportunity to either participate in the
transaction or vote as to whether the transaction should be approved
(b) the circumstances were unacceptable because:
[t]he acquisition of control over 85% of voting shares in Twinza
by the secured creditors is not taking place in an efficient, competitive
informed market contrary to the purpose set out in
section 602(a)
Corporations Act
[t]he holders of shares in Twinza do not have a reasonable time
to consider the proposal for the change of control nor have they been
enough information to enable them to assess the merits of the proposal, contrary
to the purpose set out in
section 602(b)
Corporations Act
[t]he shareholders of Twinza will not have a reasonable and
equal opportunity to participate in any benefits accruing from [the Scheme],
indeed are they being afforded any opportunity to participate in any benefits,
contrary to the purpose set out in
section 602(c)
Corporations
to the Panel’s jurisdiction to consider the matter, WM Clough referred to
the Panel’s statement in
St Barbara Mines Limited and Taipan Resources
The Panel is empowered to declare that unacceptable
circumstances exist in relation to the affairs of the company, because of their
effect on the control of that company. There is no express exclusion of a
change of control resulting from a members’ scheme
of arrangement under
of the Law.
Nonetheless,
in our view, it would generally be inappropriate for the Panel to conduct
proceedings concerning a scheme of arrangement.
Clough submitted that the Panel
“clearly has jurisdiction to declare
that unacceptable circumstances exist in relation to a change of control of a
public company
with more than 50 shareholders pursuant to a scheme of
arrangement or other control transaction”
and that the
“statement by the Panel in that case importantly also only speaks to
members’ schemes of arrangement. Whilst there are
a number of instances
where the Panel has considered applications in relation to schemes of
arrangement there are none that are analogous
to the current circumstances
arising out of a creditors’ scheme of arrangement.”
highlighted the difference between a members’ scheme of arrangement, where
members are given the opportunity to vote on
the proposed scheme, and the
creditors’ scheme proposed by Twinza, under which Twinza was not proposing
to give shareholders
any vote in relation to the change of control
transaction.
further submitted that, while it “
accepts that it will have the
opportunity to make submissions at the second Court hearing ... including in
relation to the specific
issue that arises under
section 411(17)(a)
Corporations Act
... if it was successful in making a submission at that time
the submission would be very much a Pyrrhic victory because it would

significant time and money by Twinza in promoting
Clough submitted that, while it had “

Interim orders sought
Clough did not seek any interim orders.
Final orders sought
Clough sought a final order requiring Twinza to obtain approval from its
ordinary shareholders, pursuant to item 7 of
section 611
Corporations
, for the proposed issue of shares by Twinza to the secured creditors under
the scheme.
Preliminary submissions
its preliminary submissions, Twinza submitted that:

another entity in respect of which Mr Clough is the ultimate sole shareholder,
director and controlling mind) (the Clough Parties) have intervened in the

It is the Panel’s general approach not to conduct
proceedings where a court has already commenced scrutiny of a scheme
and, although it accepted that “
that general approach does not apply if
there are defects in the Court’s ability to apply the policy
there was no such defect in this case because:
the issue of value is currently before the Federal

submissions in relation to that issue to the Court
the Clough Parties have had ample time to obtain an expert
report. They have already applied for an adjournment and can make a further
application to the Federal Court

Court about the interaction of the Scheme with Chapter 6 and the purposes

, and it is accepted that the Clough Parties will
have the opportunity to make further submissions at the second court hearing,
will be considered by the Federal Court
it is not correct, as submitted by the Clough Parties, that the
general provisions of Chapter 6 of the
Corporations Act
nor the Eggleston
principles will not be considered as part of the Scheme process
(c) There is
“no reason that the Panel should depart from its usual
approach of not conducting proceedings and to interfere with the Federal
Court’s scrutiny of the Scheme
their preliminary submissions, the Tor Funds agreed with Twinza and raised two
additional reasons why, according to the Tor Funds,
the Panel should not conduct
proceedings. The first reason was that if the Scheme did not go ahead, the Tor
Funds would need to
determine [their] future course of action,
including alternate enforcement of their rights
”, such as through the
liquidation of Twinza. The second reason was that:
well established that where the constituents of a class have no economic
interest in the assets of the scheme company, they
should not be entitled to
have a vote on the scheme. In cases where there is no equity value left (that
is, the assets of the scheme
company are insufficient to repay creditors in
full), the creditors’ scheme should be free to proceed without the need
a separate vote of the members.
The role of the Panel in schemes of arrangement
Panel is empowered to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances on a
number of grounds,
including that
the circumstances are:
(a) unacceptable having regard to the control, or potential control, of a
company, or on the acquisition, or proposed acquisition,
by a person of a
substantial interest in a company;
(b) otherwise unacceptable having regard to the purposes of Chapter 6 set out in
section 602.
power to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances is not limited to
takeover bids and extends to other control transactions,
including schemes of
arrangement.
the Panel has historically been reluctant to conduct proceedings once the Court
has commenced its scrutiny of a scheme of
arrangement.
That is because the
Court has the power to deal with all aspects of schemes of
arrangement
and the breadth of
the discretion conferred by
subsection 411(17)

that the Courts be the forum for the resolution of issues relating to

Panel has not previously considered a creditors’ scheme. The Panel has
considered several matters where a company is in
receivership or administration
and has entered into a deed of company
arrangement.
In those matters,
the Panel has noted that there is no exception from
section 606
for deeds of
company arrangement and therefore, the requirements of Chapter 6 cannot be
Even so, the Panel has
stated that
“proceedings will generally be unlikely to be conducted
where a company is in administration, and no equity value remains in
its shares.

the Panel decided to conduct proceedings, it did so because it considered, among
other things, that the application contained
credible allegations of potentially
serious unacceptable circumstances on matters squarely within the Panel’s

Report. The Independent Expert concluded that,
among other things, “In
the event the Scheme does not proceed, the total debts owing to the Senior
Lenders and Other Senior
Lenders exceeds the value of Twinza’s assets by
between US$55 million and US$128 million. The independent expert also compared
the book value of Twinza’s assets as at 30 June 2024 (US$281 million) to
Twinza’s debt of US$324 million as at 31 May
2025 and noted “we do

Shareholder approval
application also raised concerns that the dilution of the ordinary shareholders
and the proposed lack of shareholder approval
for the Scheme were contrary to
section 602
principles. If there is no equity value remaining in
Twinza’s shares, the purposes of Chapter 6 may have limited relevance.
Nevertheless, we note that the issue of potential classes for existing
shareholders was explicitly identified at the first Court
hearing and will be

Twinza shares on issue upon implementation of the
Scheme. There was no
disclosure as to whether any person would obtain or increase their voting power
above the 20% threshold as
a result of the Scheme, although that possibility
clearly arises.
order to ensure that the Court has all relevant information before it when
considering Chapter 6, the Panel asked Twinza to provide
the following
information to the Court at the second Court hearing:
(a) the name of each person whose voting power in Twinza will increase from 20%
or below to more than 20%, or from a starting point
that is above 20% and below
90%, as a result of the Scheme and
(b) the resultant voting power in Twinza held by each such person.
