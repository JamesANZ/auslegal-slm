THE APPLICANT’S MATERIAL
[7] The applicant relies on the following
(1) Originating application (seeking orders pursuant to r 208(c)
– UCPR) filed 28 February 2025.
(2) Affidavit of Mathew Michael
Hickey (solicitor) filed 28 February 2025.
(3) Affidavit of Mathew Michael
Hickey (solicitor) service upon the respondent filed by leave 2 May 2025.
[8] The applicant conveniently also provided:
- Written submissions
dated 2 May 2025.
- Draft Orders.
[9] The respondent did not appear on
the hearing of the application and has not filed any material in response.
THE RELEVANT RULE
[10] The UCPR was relatively recently amended in
respect of Chapter 7 – Disclosure, to introduce provisions in relation to
‘preliminary
disclosure.’
[11] Whilst the provisions of ch 7
initially only applied to the Supreme Court, that was repealed effective 16
February 2024 such that the District Court and Magistrates
Court are now vested
with the power to make orders for preliminary disclosure.
[12] This is one
of the first, if not the first, applications for preliminary disclosure in the
Magistrates Court.
– UCPR empowers the court in these
(2) the court may order that the other person– ...
(b) produce to the applicant a document or thing relating to the identity or
whereabouts of the prospective defendant as directed
by the order.
[14] The discretion to be exercised in making orders pursuant to r 208C (2) is
informed by the prerequisites contained in
[15] Ruel 208C (1)
provides as follows:
(1) The court may make an order under subrule (2) if it
appears to the court that–
(a) an applicant may have a right to relief against a prospective defendant;
(b) the applicant has made reasonable inquiries, but is unable to
sufficiently ascertain the identity or whereabouts of the prospective
(c) another person may have information, or possession or control of a
document or thing, that may assist in ascertaining the identity
or whereabouts
of the prospective defendant.
[16] The other procedural requirements of r 208C are:
- The application must
be supported by an affidavit stating the facts on which the applicant relies and
the information, document,
or thing in respect of which the order is
- If the application is not made in
an existing proceeding it must be commenced by originating
application.
- The application and
supporting affidavit must be served personally on the other person (the
respondent).
[17] Chapter 7 –
commences with a number of relevant definitions for the part which are provided
In this part –
“applicant” means a person who applies for an order under this
“document” includes a class of documents
“identity”, of a prospective defendant, includes the name and
the occupation, if any, of the prospective defendant.
“prospective
defendant”, in relation to an applicant, means a person against whom the
applicant intends to start and proceeding.
“whereabouts”, of a
prospective defendant, includes a place of residence, registered office, place
of business or other
location of the prospective defendant.
THE RELEVANT
LEGAL PRINCIPLES
[19] Due to the relevant recency of the commencement of the
‘preliminary disclosure’ provisions contained in ch 7
there are to date limited authorities.
[20] Decisions analyse similar but
differently worded rules in other jurisdictions.
[21] Brown J (as Her Honour
then was) has provided a comprehensive and practically useful decision in
respect of r 208C and its application
in Blue Dog Group Pty Ltd v Glaucus
Research Group California LLC [2024] QSC
[22] That case involved the applicant
Blue Dog Group seeking production of documents pursuant to r 208C and r 208D in
respect of a
prospective action against an unknown proposed defendant for what
was called ‘targeted activist short selling.’ Her Honour
the power of the court to make orders as to preliminary discovery was apparently
introduced to supplement the power of
the court (the Supreme Court with inherent
available under
the principles set out in the House of Lord’s decision of
Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] AC
[23] In respect to the definition
contained in r 208B of the ‘prospective defendant’ Her Honour
accepted that r 208C (1)
provided the court must also be satisfied that the
applicant intends to start a proceeding against the ‘prospective
defendant.’
[24] After expressing
that caution must be exercised when reviewing court’s analysis of similar
but differently worded rules
in other jurisdictions Her Honour went on to
consider a number of decisions in respect of the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules
(NSW) providing for preliminary
disclosure.
[25] After comprehensively
considering the New South Wales authorities, Her Honour observed in relation to
the requirement that the
document and or thing may assist in ascertaining the
identify of the prospective defendant that that requirement in the Queensland
rule had a slightly lower threshold than the New South Wales
[26] The applicant must satisfy the
court that:
- The applicant may have a right of relief against a prospective
- The applicant has made reasonable enquiries but is unable to
sufficiently ascertain the identity or whereabouts of the prospective
- Another person may have information or possession or control of a
document or thing that may assist in ascertaining the identity
or whereabouts of
the prospective defendant.
THE APPLICANT MAY HAVE A RIGHT OF RELIEVING
AGAINST A PROSPECTIVE DEFENDANT
[27] The applicant’s material provides
direct evidence that as a consequence of an error in transcribing the bank
account details
by a staff member of the applicant, a substantial sum of money
($44,500) was paid in error to an unknown person or persons who hold
account with the respondent.
right to relief of the applicant is to commence proceedings by way of claim for
unjust enrichment.
THE APPLICANT HAS MADE REASONABLE ENQURIES BUT IS UNABLE
TO SUFFICIENTLY ASCERTAIN THE IDENTITY OR WHEREABOUTS OF THE PROSPECTIVE
[29] The applicant’s material confirms that upon
ascertaining the mistake in respect of the payment to the wrong bank account
number, the applicant sought to trace payment of the funds but was unsuccessful.
The only identity particulars available to the applicant
was the BSB number for
the account which confirmed that it was associated with the
respondent.
ANOTHER PERSON MAY HAVE
INFORMATION OR POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF A DOCUMENT THAT MAY ASSIST IN
ASCERTAINING THE IDENTITY OR WHEREABOUTS
OF THE PROSPECTIVE
[30] The applicant’s evidence confirms that the BSB number
for the account to which the payment was made in error, is associated
respondent. The respondent as a bank would hold in its records details of the
account holders for the account identified
by number to which the payment was
[31] The applicant sought on a number of occasions to make enquiries
of the respondent to identify or require production of the identity
account holder but received no
CONSIDERATION
applicant has on its affidavit evidence satisfied all of the requirements of r
[33] The applicant having made a payment in error to an unidentified
party, who holds a bank account with the respondent, has identified
relief against that prospective defendant being a claim for unjust enrichment.
[34] As Brown J (as Her Honour then was) noted
It is sufficient as in the
present case that there is evidence that the applicant intends to commence
proceedings against a prospective
defendant if:
(a) They are permitted to inspect the document.
(b) The contents of the
document are such that it is appropriate to commence the
proceedings.
[35] The applicant has made reasonable enquiries, indeed exhausted the enquiries
available to it, to endeavour to ascertain the identity
of the prospective
defendant but has been unable to do so.
[36] The respondent, who has chosen
not to appear on the hearing of this applicant and further chosen not to respond
to the written
request from the applicant’s lawyers, is clearly a person
who may have information that may assist in ascertaining the identity
account holder. On the applicant’s material the finding that the
respondent in fact does possess information or documents
which identify the
identity of the prospective defendant is appropriate to be made.
nature of the documents sought to be disclosed in the application, namely the
names of the holders of the account and authorised
operators, the residential
address, mailing address, contact phone numbers, and email address are all
matters that clearly would
be held by the respondent.
[38] Documents
disclosing that material ought be properly the subject of the preliminary
disclosure order sought by the applicant.
DISPOSITION
[39] The applicant
having satisfied all the requirements of
Uniform Civil Procedure
(Qld) is appropriate to make the orders sought, namely:

Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
