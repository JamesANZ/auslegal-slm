REASONS FOR DECISION
19 May 2008 Mr B Hatch, Senior Member
The decision under review
in this matter is the decision of the Road Transport Authority
) internal review affirming the decision of the RTA to
cancel the applicant’s driver’s licence on medical
2. The power to cancel a driver’s licence is contained in
Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Regulation 2000
regulations”
). The relevant part of that Regulation is
regulation 88.
For the current purposes, it is worth setting out subsections (1) and (4) of
regulation 88
88 Procedures for variation, suspension and cancellation of
driver licences
(1) If the road transport authority proposes to vary, suspend or cancel a
person’s driver licence (the
proposed action
) on its own
initiative, the authority must give the person a written notice
(a) the proposed action; and
(b) if the proposed action is to vary the licence—the proposed
variation; and
(c) if the proposed action is to suspend the licence—the proposed
suspension period; and
(d) the grounds for the proposed
action; and
(e) any action that must be taken by the person to avoid or reverse the
proposed action; and
(f) the date when the variation, suspension or cancellation takes effect (the
date of effect
(g) whether and, if so, by when the person is required to return the licence
to the authority if the proposed action takes effect
(4) The date of effect must not be earlier than 14 days after the notice is
given to the person.
3. In this matter the RTA relied upon
which relevantly provides as follows:
87 When authority may vary, suspend or cancel driver
(1) The road transport authority may vary, suspend or cancel a person’s
driver licence on its own initiative under
(Procedures for variation,
suspension or cancellation of driver licences) if the authority is satisfied on
reasonable grounds that—
..............
(d) the person does not comply with the required medical standards; or
4. For the purposes of
regulation 87
the required medical standards is defined
regulation 15
as follows:
15 Meaning of required medical standards
For this regulation, the
required medical standards
, in relation to
a person, are the medical standards set out in the publication Assessing Fitness
to Drive, as amended from time to
time, published by Austroads Incorporated,
that apply to the person.
5. The above regulations are not a model of clarity. The power to vary,
suspend or cancel in
regulation 88
arises from obvious implication of the
regulation rather than a clear statement that the RTA can vary, suspend or
6. Pursuant to the
Legislation Act 2001
section 180
given by a law to make a decision includes the power to reverse or change the
decision. As the RTA has the power to issue
a driver’s licence it thereby
would have the power to reverse that decision which would entail cancelling the
Section 139
Legislation Act
also supports this by requiring the
Tribunal to interpret a law that would best achieve the purposes of the Act.
History of this matter
7. The applicant was born on 20 April 1986. The applicant gave evidence
that he obtained his driver’s licence in April 2003
and was licensed
continuously until his licence was cancelled by way of letter from the RTA on 24
January 2008. Pursuant to that
letter the applicant was required to surrender
his driver’s licence by 14 February 2008. His evidence is that he has had
motor vehicle collisions in that time. The first was as a result of
recklessness when he held a learner’s permit. The second
one involved
running into the rear of another motor vehicle when that motor vehicle stopped
suddenly. While the applicant considered
that accident to be due to other
vehicles acting in an unexpected fashion, I find that it was more likely due to
inexperience as
at the time the applicant had only been licensed to drive for a
few months. Other than that, the applicant has had an uneventful
history over nearly five years.
8. The applicant gave evidence that he
has also ridden a motor bike for the last four or five months without incident.
clear from the evidence whether the motor cycle riding had occurred on
public roads as a licensed driver or whether it occurred in
other circumstances.
I do not find that anything turns on that issue in any event. The
applicant’s evidence was that, in the
last five years, he has had various
jobs which involved driving either standard sedan motor vehicles or utility
vehicles but also
including a 3 tonne truck. In 2006 the applicant travelled to
Europe for two months and drove extensively through England, Serbia,
Croatia and
9. The applicant gave evidence that he has had problems with his
eye sight since birth. The medical evidence is that he has X-linked
retinoschisis. This is a genetic disorder. Some of the evidence presented
suggests that the condition may deteriorate although
it may not.
cross-examination the only matters raised were that the applicant had
difficulties reading the whiteboard when he was at school
and that medical
advice was given to his school that allowances needed to be made as to where he
sat in the classroom so that the
applicant could more easily read the whiteboard
and other materials.
11. In all other respects the evidence of the
applicant was not challenged. I find that the applicant has since 2003 been a
and confident driver.
12. The applicant’s driver’s
licence was cancelled because, in the opinion of the RTA, he failed to meet the
medical standard as set out in the ‘Assessing Fitness to
Drive’ book (
) as published by Austroads Inc.
regulation 15
of the regulations). The book appears to be published by
‘Austroads’ and ‘NTC Australia’. According to
NTC Australia is the National Transport Commission being an independent body
established under an inter-governmental agreement
and funded jointly by the
Federal, State and Territory Governments. The book states that Austroads is the
Association of Australian
and New Zealand Road Transport and Traffic Authority.
The book does not explicitly state that it is published by Austroads Inc.
book does state that the copyright in it is owned by Austroads Inc. I draw the
conclusion that this book is the book referred
regulation 15.
A relevant part of the book is
‘Vision and Eye Disorders’.
In order to meet the criteria, a driver should have a visual acuity which is not
14. The evidence before the Tribunal is that 6/12 is a
recognised eye sight criteria. What is in lay terms best described as normal
vision is 6/6 which means that a person can see from 6 metres what the average
person can see from 6 metres. The evidence of Dr
Alan Johnston was that a
healthy young person would be expected to have better than that such as 6/5 or
6/4. This would mean that
the healthy young person could see from 6 metres what
the average person would see from 4 or 5 metres. Dr Johnston found that the
applicant had vision in his right eye of 6/15 and in his left eye of 6/24.
15. On the face of it therefore, the applicant does not meet the
standards to have an unconditional driving licence. The book however
a conditional licence may be granted taking into account the opinion of the
treating doctor/GP/optometrist and the nature
of the driving task and subject to
periodic review:
If the standard is met
with corrective lenses; and
consideration of the nature of any underlying
16. The evidence of Dr John Downie,
ophthalmic surgeon, which was accepted by the other witnesses was that the
applicant’s
eye sight with correction was 6/18 in both eyes. Dr Downie
also stated that his binocular field of vision was more than 120 degrees.
was no dispute that the applicant’s field of vision met the standards in
of the book states at 3.5.1 under the heading
‘Conditional Licences’ that:
a conditional licence may be recommended by the examining health professional
for drivers who have not met the criteria, but whose
medical treatment and/or
vehicle or driving modifications may enable them to drive safety.
18. Much of the time of the Tribunal in this matter was taken up by the issue
of telescopic lenses attached to a spare pair of spectacles
and whether that
would enable the applicant to meet the visual acuity criteria and, if so,
thereby be safe to drive a motor vehicle.
Evidence was given that such
telescopic lenses have not been allowed in any Australian jurisdiction although
it is unclear to what
extent other jurisdictions have given consideration to
such devices. There was evidence that more than 30 States of the United States
of America allow drivers to use such telescopic lenses. I do not regard either
of these pieces of evidence as probative. The first
issue to determine in
relation to the telescopic lenses is whether they are corrective lenses for the
purposes of the book. Under
the medical standards for vision and eye disorders
the words “corrective lenses” are used. Under the general
guidelines the words “glasses or contact lenses” are
used. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary does not provide a
definition for “glasses” but gives one definition of
“glass” as “an optical instrument used
as an aid to sight: a
telescope”. Reference is then made to an “eye glass” and in
the plural as “glasses
for spectacles”. The Dictionary then defines
“spectacle” as, amongst other things, a “device for assisting
defective eye sight, or for protecting the eyes from dust, light etc. consisting
of two glass lenses set in a frame which supported
on the nose, and frequently
kept in place by legs passing over the ears”.
19. I find that a pair of spectacles fitted with a telescopic lense are
corrective lenses or glasses for the purposes of the book.
20. Even though the spectacles fitted with a telescopic lense are corrective
lenses for the purposes of the book does not end the
matter as to whether they
are appropriate in relation to a person’s fitness to drive.
21. Dr Johnston gave evidence as to the use of telescopic lenses incorporated
in spectacles for the purpose of driving. According
to Dr Johnston, the
American experience has been that such devices are safe. Some training is
required in the use of the telescopic
lense. According to Dr Johnston, the use
of the telescopic lense does not unnecessarily detract from peripheral vision
and therefore
many drivers are quite safe using those devices.
22. Evidence was also given by Dr Morris Odell. Dr Odell is a senior forensic
physician and has been an adviser to Vicroads for
many years. He is not an
ophthalmic surgeon but has many years’ experience in assessing
people’s fitness to drive motor
vehicles in relation to various health
issues. Dr Odell expressed serious reservations about the use of telescopic
lenses particularly
in relation to the loss of peripheral vision when the driver
attempts to use the telescopic lense. Dr Odell gave evidence that,
while there
was considerable support for telescopic lenses particularly in many American
States, there was little hard evidence as
to their efficacy and that much of the
support for the lenses came from those advocating their use.
23. I find that the use of telescopic lenses in spectacles for the purposes of
driving are not proven to be safe and were this matter
to turn on that issue, I
would not consider such corrective lenses to be appropriate for driving a motor
vehicle. It may be that
in future there is sufficient evidence to support the
use of these lenses for driving but, at this stage, I do not accept that such
evidence exists.
24. The more important evidence in this matter came from Dr Odell. Prior to Dr
Odell giving evidence, Dr Downie, an ophthalmic
surgeon, gave evidence. His
evidence was that, while the applicant does not meet the acquity standard, his
full field of vision
means that he is of no danger when driving a motor vehicle.
Dr Odell then gave evidence and, after extensive evidence in relation
telescopic lenses, he gave evidence that, in his opinion, the applicant would be
allowed to hold a driving licence in Victoria
and that Dr Odell would support
such a situation. It should be noted, however, that Dr Odell had not actually
examined the applicant
although Dr Odell is regularly called upon to review
medical histories of people who are seeking drivers’ licences in Victoria
and he has experience in making such assessments often without the requirement
of an actual examination of the person concerned.
25. I find that the applicant is fit to drive a motor vehicle and he should be
granted a driving licence. Considering his medical
condition, however, and the
evidence of the doctors, it should be a condition of his driving licence that
initially he be required
to undergo a medical examination particularly in
relation to his eye sight on a yearly basis. It would be a matter for the RTA
consider after a few years whether such annual reviews are thereafter
required or whether some other regime should be put in place
26. I set aside the decision under review and in its place decide that the
applicant be granted a licence to drive a motor vehicle
such licence to be of
the same class previously held by the applicant on the condition that the
applicant undergo a medical examination
on an annual basis in relation to his
