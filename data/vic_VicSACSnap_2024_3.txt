Sentencing Snapshot 287: Sentencing Trends for Arson in the Higher Courts
of Victoria 2018-19 to 2022-23
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing outcomes
for the offence of arson
County and Supreme Courts of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2018-19 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June 2023 have been incorporated
into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on arson and other offences is also available on
A person who intentionally and without lawful excuse destroys or damages any
property belonging to another by setting it on fire is
guilty of arson. A person
is deemed to have destroyed or damaged the property intentionally if it was the
person's purpose to do
so or if the person was aware that their conduct was more
likely than not to result in the damage to or destruction of the property.
is an indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 15 years'
imprisonment or a fine of 1,800 penalty
It can be tried summarily in
the Magistrates' Court if certain criteria are
This Snapshot focuses on cases where arson was the principal offence, that
is, cases where arson was the offence that received the
most severe
Arson was the principal offence in 1.6% of cases sentenced in the higher
courts between 2018-19 and 2022-23.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 138 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of arson.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
arson by financial year. There were 25 people sentenced
for this offence in
2022-23, down from 31 in the previous year. The number of people sentenced was
highest in 2021-22 (31 people)
and lowest in 2020-21 (24 people).
There was also 1 person who received a custodial supervision order and 6
people who received a non-custodial supervision order for
the principal offence
of arson during the five-year period. These outcomes are not included elsewhere
in this Snapshot.

an immediate custodial sentence or non-custodial sentence for the principal

The rate of immediate
custodial sentences was lowest in 2018-19 (82.8%) and highest in 2021-22
(96.8%). Over the five-year period,
87.7% of people were given an immediate
custodial sentence.

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the principal offence of arson from 2018-19 to 2022-23.
The principal sentence describes sentences for the offence at
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves
multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the same as or
longer than the principal
Principal sentences of imprisonment
There were 119 principal sentences of imprisonment
for arson. Table 2 shows that 101 of those (84.9%) were non-aggregate

terms, and 18 were aggregate imprisonment
There were 52 people who
received a community correction order in addition to their imprisonment

Figure 3 shows the imprisonment lengths for the 101 non-aggregate
imprisonment terms for the principal offence of arson. Imprisonment
ranged from 1 month to 8 years,
while the median imprisonment length was 2 years and 6 months.
The most common range of imprisonment lengths was less than 1 year (24
principal sentences).

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 119 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for the principal
offence of arson, 86 were eligible to have a non-parole period
Of these people, 59 were

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for arson face multiple
charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks at the
of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of arson.
Figure 8 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
arson by the total number of sentenced offences per person.
The number of
sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 25, and the median was 2
offences. There were 47 people (34.1%) sentenced
for the single offence of
arson. The average number of offences per person was 3.2.

Number of offences
Table 3 shows the 10 most common offences co-sentenced alongside arson. The
last column sets out the average number of offences sentenced
per person. For
example, 22 of the total 138 people (15.9%) were also sentenced for theft. On
average, those 22 people were sentenced
for 2.1 charges of theft per case.
