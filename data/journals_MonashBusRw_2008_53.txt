Skilled immigrants

In order to harness this diversified resource for the economic benefit of Australia, the dichotomy between the skills acquisition
policy and settlement practice needs to be resolved to smooth the integration process, writes

According to a recent Government estimate, Australia faces a shortage of more than 200,000 skilled workers over the next five years
and a deficit of 240,000 workers by 2016.
Australia partly addresses its acute skills shortage by bringing skilled immigrants from different countries. These immigrants go
through a well-developed selection process, but after arrival they often face various labour market disadvantages.
Statistics reveal that they are not properly utilized in their workplaces and face difficulties integrating themselves into the labour
market. Previous research has focused on individual attributes, such as their English language ability, local credentials and experience,
as the main influencing factors for their utilization and proper integration.
This research looks more closely at the institutions – which deal with settlement issues – and employers, the ultimate
absorber of skills – and discovers that they can play a more important role than they currently do. This paper looks at how
diversified human capital is converted into a productive resource in a local context and argues that the dichotomy between the skills
acquisition policy and the settlement practice causes the underutilisation of skilled immigrants, which then affects the process
of integration in Australia.
From the findings, it is clear that the existing institutional mechanisms of skill acquisition and utilization do not fulfil their
objectives. After undertaking a tight selection process, skilled immigrants arrive in Australia with new hope, committed and motivated,
having moved to a new place to take up the challenge. But the reality is often disappointing.
The Australian Government is responding to the initial needs of immigrant groups through different settlement programs, but the level-playing
field approach by authorities such as Centrelink or the Adult Migrant English Program or the existing website information is not
sufficiently effective for skilled immigrants to find suitable jobs and integrate into the labour market.
Few settlement services are directly targeted at labour market integration. With the exception of humanitarian immigrants, skilled
immigrants do not have access to social security and available labour market services in the first two years of their entry. Before
1997, skilled immigrants could receive unemployment and social security benefits six months after their arrival. This policy changed
in 1997 and skilled immigrants now have to wait two years to receive unemployment and social security benefits. This change has a
negative impact on the morale and psychological position of the newly arrived skilled immigrants.
New arrivals are very unfamiliar with the environment and often unaware of services available to them. They face enormous challenges
in settling and find it difficult to both adjust to Australian norms and interact with the broader community.
Culture shock and low levels of local knowledge compound these challenges, causing isolation, confusion, frustration and a sense of
disempowerment and difficulty in accessing services. Consequently, these immigrants often initially accept any kind of job, which
affects their level of confidence and integration. Existing settlement agencies mostly focus on the under-privileged immigrant groups,
with little or no focus on skilled immigrants. The outcomes of existing programs are also difficult to evaluate as there is insufficient
detailed data. When the workforce is heterogeneous, a carefully designed settlement policy can benefit skilled people.
Taking into account the broader institutional context and the challenges presented by the transition to a knowledge economy, it is
argued that creating institutional capacity to facilitate effective immigrant skill utilization should be a priority for settlement
policy and major institutional innovations are necessary. Important aspects are: better sources of information for immigrants, web-based
or otherwise, available both before and after their arrival; more support for credentials-assessment services to improve their labour
market effectiveness.
Necessary resources include HR management training programs that include training on ethnic diversity issues, employers’ best
practices on recognition of skills and improved public awareness of the problems faced by skilled immigrants. Action must be taken
to minimise the barriers to employment created by discrimination or racial prejudice.
Governments, immigrant service providers, regulators and employers must work together to design programs which expose immigrant professionals
to social, cultural and language proficiency criteria. Informing employers about the utility of immigrant human capital may have
a vital impact.
Employers themselves can also play a significant role in this matter. They need to be effectively engaged in the whole process, not
only to say where the skills shortage lies, but also how the skills can be utilised.Immigrants should be made aware of the institutional
supports available for developing professional communication according to Australian employers’ norms, recruitment policy and
practices and organisational culture – before aiming for an expected job. Local training, development and bridging courses
may ensure the required Australian professional standards. Subsidised workplace internships and structured mentoring programs can
be introduced. For the full transformation of human capital for the workplace, institutional commitment and intention are a must,
in order to convert a diversified resource into a synergic unified strength for the economic benefit of Australia.
The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) can be engaged more in the process of bridging the gaps between
immigrants’ skills and employers’ requirements. The Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector can play a greater
role than it currently does. More institutional supports are crucial for immigrants to minimise skill under-utilisation.
