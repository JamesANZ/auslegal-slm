INTRODUCTION
review Panel, Sylvia Falzon, Christian Johnston (sitting President), and Neil
Pathak, declined to conduct proceedings on an application
by Mr Nicholas Bolton
in relation to the affairs of Keybridge. The application submitted (among other
things) that some directors
of Keybridge were participating insiders in relation
to Yowie’s all-scrip takeover bid for Keybridge and that an entity
with the Wilson Asset Management Group had breached section
as a result of a loan provided
to Keybridge. The review Panel concluded there was no reasonable prospect that
it would make a declaration
of unacceptable circumstances. Accordingly, the
review Panel declined to conduct proceedings.

Condition can be waived at any time while Keybridge continues to control
However, the No Control Condition can be fulfilled by Yowie issuing Yowie Shares

doing so using Keybridge’s need for funding and
Yowie doing so through

(b) the WAM Active-nominated Keybridge Directors were participating

intend to proceed with the despatch of

This announcement has been authorised for release by Antony
Catalano and Sulieman Ravell, directors of Yowie.
10 July 2025 at 2:32 pm, the initial Panel declined to conduct
proceedings.
APPLICATION
15 July 2025, Mr Bolton requested the President’s consent to apply for a
review of the decision of the initial Panel.
Bolton submitted that the initial Panel erred in a number of
considering that the substance of the application had already
been decided by either a court or by [Takeovers Panel] proceedings
(b) by considering that the Yowie Bid was highly conditional and therefore not a
genuine opportunity for Keybridge shareholders
(c) by forming a view that it was not appropriate to make remedial orders where
circumstances had been overtaken by events, and
not forming a view that insider participation in the
circumstances was unacceptable
Bolton stated that no court or Panel had previously considered the implications

to be made, for such time as WAM was providing
funding to Keybridge including
conditions on board composition it would be appropriate for Keybridge to
establish an independent
board committee to respond to any genuine takeover
Interim orders sought
Bolton sought interim orders:
(a) requiring Yowie to dispatch the bidder’s statement and
(b) precluding Yowie from relying on the No Board Change Condition until the
conclusion of the Panel proceedings.
Final orders sought
Bolton did not specify any final orders in the review application. We presumed
that he continued to seek the final orders specified
in the initial application
although, given our conclusions (set out below), it was not necessary for us to
confirm whether this was
Acting President’s consent
President’s approach to consenting to a review is guided by the following
considerations:
(a) that it is a policy underpinning
section 657EA(2)
that there should be a
prompt conclusion to Panel proceedings
(b) whether there was any potential error in the sitting Panel’s decision
(c) whether there is any other basis for granting consent, for example, if there
is new evidence, the importance of the dispute,
whether there would be material
prejudice to any party by consenting or by withholding consent, and the merits
of the sitting Panel’s
Acting President considered that, given the complexity of the factual matrix
underlying the initial application and the review
application, it was possible
that the matter would benefit by reconsideration. He also noted that Mr Bolton
had suggested (by Mr
Bolton’s statement that there had been a
change in circumstances
”) that there might be new evidence.
On the other hand, the Acting President considered that the policy that there
a prompt conclusion to Panel proceedings weighed against granting
consent to the review application, particularly given the number
matters to date. Although the considerations were finely balanced, the Acting
President decided to provide his consent
to the review application.

the material relating to events that occurred

we received the materials relating to both the initial application and the
review application, we formed a preliminary view
that there was no reasonable
prospect that we would make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances.
However, the initial Panel’s
reasons had not at that stage been published.
We decided not to make a decision until we had reviewed the initial
Panel’s reasons
and the parties’ comments on those reasons,
which we subsequently received.
his comments on the initial Panel’s reasons, Mr Bolton suggested that the
initial Panel should not have formed a view on
certain issues which, according
to Mr Bolton, were not explicitly raised by the initial application. These
issues included a potential
association between Mr Catalano and WAM
and a potential
contravention of
section 606
as a result of that potential
association.
this point, we agree with the statement of the Panel in
BreakFree Limited
that the Panel is “

addition, our review is not limited by the findings of the initial Panel or
confined to the grounds raised in the review
application.
We are entitled to
consider the whole of the initial application and any new circumstances,
although we are not obliged to go further
than the review application if we do
not consider it necessary.
Accordingly,
we do not think that we are (or the initial Panel were) precluded from
considering whether there has been a contravention
section 606
or a potential
association between Mr Catalano and WAM Active or, indeed, any other matter
which is logically connected with the
matters raised by the initial application
or the review application.
What we considered
endorse and adopt the initial Panel’s reasons, subject to our further
comments set out below.
Insider participation
relation to the alleged insider participation by the WAM Active-nominated
Keybridge Directors, the initial Panel stated that it
was of the view that
there is no reasonable prospect that this would lead to unacceptable
circumstances in the circumstances of this matter and on the
initial Panel also stated that imposing on Keybridge a requirement for an
independent board committee would be “
an unreasonable burden
because it was “
not persuaded that the Bid has any realistic prospect
of proceeding
agree with the initial Panel that there was no reasonable prospect that the
alleged insider participation by the WAM Active-nominated
Keybridge Directors
would lead to unacceptable circumstances in the circumstances of this matter.
We came to this conclusion in
part because we formed the view that there was no
realistic prospect of the Bid proceeding at the time at which the conduct said
to constitute insider participation occurred or thereafter, including because of
the highly conditional nature of the bid and the
history of disputes between the
key parties.
considered Keybridge’s submission referred to above in paragraph
. It did not change our view in this
also agree with the initial Panel that “
WAM [Active] is not competing
with Yowie for control of Keybridge [through the Bridge Funding Facility] as it
already has practical
Frustrating action
relation to the question of whether Keybridge had engaged in frustrating action,
the initial Panel stated that:
“We addressed the issue of
frustrating action in [Keybridge Capital Limited 17 [2025] ATP 15]. The issue
was also raised on
review of our decision by the review Panel in [Keybridge
Capital Limited 18R [2025] ATP 17]. The change in condition (assuming it
not run foul of
section 631)
does not change the position in our view. ...
Indeed, a number of the submissions in the application sought to revisit, or
substantially
overlapped with, matters that had already been considered and
determined in earlier court and Panel proceedings. Yet others were
considered that neither Yowie’s withdrawal of the Bid on 10 July 2025 nor
its not making offers pursuant to the Bid or dispatching
the bidder’s
statement constituted a new set of circumstances. Those events were
inextricable from the events in the initial
Panel proceedings. We agree with
the initial Panel that the Bid did not have any realistic prospect of proceeding
and accordingly
consider that Keybridge has not acted to frustrate the Bid in a
way that would give rise to unacceptable circumstances.
Association
relation to the various alleged associations referred to in paragraph
above, the initial Panel concluded
the extent that Mr Bolton is making an association claim ...
we consider that it is not supported by
and that it
not satisfied that the application meets the Mount Gibson hurdle
for conducting proceedings on [an] application in relation to

and WAM Active, we understand
is denied by Mr Bolton), the application did not meet the

generally. So much has been recognised in the description of that section by
the Panel in
MYOB Limited
a cornerstone of the takeovers
legislation, fundamental to the achievement of the purposes of Chapter 6 as set
result, the Panel may be more inclined to find a contravention of
section 606
unacceptable.
But it is not the
case that any contravention of Chapter 6, 6A, 6B, or 6C is
unacceptable.
on our skills, knowledge, and
experience,
we considered that
this case was one in which, even if a contravention of
section 606
established (a matter which we did not decide), it was unlikely that the
circumstances would have been unacceptable given
that the parties to the alleged
contravention were entities also within the Wilson Asset Management Group, so
that the practical
effect of such a contravention in relation to the control of
Keybridge would be immaterial.
The other issues raised in the review application
considered that it was not necessary for us to come to a view on the other
issues raised in the review application (described above
at paragraph
) given our conclusions above in
Use of the Panel
was the seventh of eight matters involving Keybridge and/or Yowie brought before
the Panel in 2025 to date (to say nothing of
the numerous court proceedings also
involving Keybridge and Yowie).
Many of those matters involved issues closely related to the issues in this
matter. We observed that the proceedings sometimes
involved overly technical
distinctions between what were said to be the different circumstances in each
case. For example, issues
of insider participation in relation to the Bid have
now been raised—and dismissed—in two initial proceedings and two
review proceedings.
arguments about the same or very similar issues do not serve a useful purpose.
If there is another Panel application brought
in relation to these issues, the
sitting Panel would (in our view) be justified in declining to conduct
proceedings on this basis
alone. It would also be justified in giving serious
consideration to whether to exercise either of the powers conferred by
(including the power under paragraph 658A(1)(b) to, subject to the Panel
being satisfied that an application is frivolous or vexatious,
make a direction
that the person who made the application must not, without the leave of the
Panel, make a subsequent application
of a kind or kinds specified in the
direction).
consider that it is not against the public interest to decline to conduct
proceedings.
the reasons above, we do not consider that there is any reasonable prospect that
we would make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances.
Accordingly, we have
decided not to conduct proceedings in relation to the application under
regulation 20

consider whether to make any interim or final
