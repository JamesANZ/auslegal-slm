SOLICITORS:
Prosecution on own behalf
Aboriginal & Torres Strait Island Legal Service for defendant
[1] The defendant has pleaded not guilty to a charge that on 1 August 2011, he
unlawfully used a motorcycle without the consent
of the owner. At the time of
the offence, the defendant was 12 years, 1 month and 11 days old, being 12 years
8 months at the date
of hearing.
[2] As a result of discussions between the
prosecution and defence before the hearing commenced, the parties agreed that
date and place of the offence, as well as the identification and
ownership of the motorcycle were not in dispute. It was also conceded
defence that the defendant’s fingerprint was found on the handlebar of the
motorcycle, but it was unknown how old that
fingerprint was.
[3] The only
matter in dispute at the hearing was the lawfulness of the alleged act and
whether the defendant had the requisite capacity
pursuant to s 29(2) of the
Criminal Code which provides –
“(2) A person under the age of
14 years is not criminally responsible for an act or omission, unless it is
proved that
at the time of doing the act or making the omission the person
had capacity to know that the person ought not to do the act
or make the
[4] I have been referred to a number of cases
which discuss the presumption and what is required to rebut that
presumption.
[5] His Honour Alan Wilson SC, DCJ in R v McCormick
considered the leading cases in this area. He quoted with approval the
Queensland Court of Appeal which held in R v
, that the prosecution is not required to
prove actual knowledge that the act was wrong, only the capacity to know that
ought not to do the act.
[6] In referring to Whitty’s
, His Honour found that the acts of which
McCormick was accused are of a much lower order than those of the accused in
Whitty, and
that is a relevant factor in deciding the case. The defendant in
Whitty’s case was charged with threatening a teacher with
a knife, whilst
the defendant in McCormick’s case was charged with offences relating to
entering bird aviaries and causing
the death and escape of birds. Here the
defendant is charged with unlawfully using a motorcycle.
[7] In McC v
it was held that the onus on the
prosecution required proof beyond mere knowledge on the child’s part that
what he was doing
was merely naughty or mischievous. However, in the more recent
decision of R v F, ex parte Attorney-General
the Queensland Court of Appeal held that section 29 simply requires the
prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused
child had the
capacity to know that he ought not to do the act which he did, and no
[8] The Queensland Court of Appeal held unanimously that
Although evidence of the accused’s age alone cannot rebut
the presumption made by s 29(2) of the Code, inferences capable
of rebutting
the presumption can be drawn from the accused’s age when considered
together with evidence of the accused’s
education or of the surrounding
circumstances of the offence, or with observations of the accused’s
speech and demeanor.
[9] The only witness called by the prosecution was the
investigating police officer, Plain Clothes Senior Constable Hogan who
photographic evidence of the motorcycle and where it was found as
well as tendering into evidence an electronic record of interview
[10] For the purposes of the question to be decided, only the
introduction to the interview and that part of the interview relating
particular offence was admitted as evidence.
[11] It is settled law that the
onus is on the prosecution to rebut the presumption contained in section 29(2)
beyond a reasonable
doubt. During the hearing, the prosecution sought to have a
criminal history, purported to be that of the defendant, tendered as
part of the
prosecution rebuttal case. The criminal history was excluded on the grounds of
documentary hearsay, as the prosecution
could not tender Certificates of
Conviction as primary evidence.
[12] Of course, a previous criminal history
which would indicate a defendant’s previous dealings with the criminal
justice system
and therefore an inference capable of rebutting the presumption
that the defendant understood what he did was wrong, is only one
of a number of
inferences to be taken into account in deciding capacity.
[13] There were
admitted into evidence pursuant to
Evidence Act
, computer generated
documents from the Cleveland Education and Training Centre located at the
Cleveland Detention Centre. One of
these documents is headed “Student
Profile Database, Cleveland Education and Training Centre, Attendance,
[14] This document evidences that the defendant child has
“visited” the Centre on 4 different occasions and gives dates
which those “visits” occurred. They are
Admitted Released Duration
24/03/2011 25/03/2011 1
03/08/2011 19/08/2011 16 days
01/09/2011 14/09/2011 13
20/09/2011 19/10/2011 29 days
[15] Whilst the information
contained in the computer generated records only provides details of the
defendant’s Personal Learning
Plan, initial assessments of literacy and
numeracy and details of his attendance at the centre, they do indicate that the
was held in this juvenile facility on four separate occasions for what
one could call significant periods for one so young in three
cases. There is
nothing before me to say why he was being held. I do note that at the time of
this incarceration, the defendant would
have been 11 years and nine months on
the first occasion, 12 years and 2 months on the second and 12 years and 3
months on the third
and fourth occasions.
[16] The fact that the defendant
was held in this facility for periods of time, indicates to me that he has had
some considerable
interaction with the justice system and cannot be said to be
an “innocent” in this regard.
[17] As far as the defence
submission that the defendant’s educational difficulties indicated he did
not have capacity, I find
that this is certainly not shown by the documents
admitted into evidence. There is an entry that states the defendant is
led by his peers” and that he needs assistance with literacy
and numeracy. In my view, these entries do not indicate that the
defendant lacks
capacity to know that what he did was wrong.
[18] I have viewed the relevant
extracts from the electronic record of interview and note that at the outset,
Plain Clothes Senior
Constable Hogan gave the defendant the usual warning. He
then asked the defendant to tell him what he thought it meant. The defendant
able to explain that he knew anything he said could be used as evidence. He also
explained that he knew he didn’t have
to answer any questions if he
didn’t want to. He also explained to the Senior Constable what it meant if
he wanted to have
a solicitor present, stating that if he did, the police would
leave the room, he would speak to the solicitor and then the police
[19] The defendant responded to the explanations in such a fashion to
prompt the Senior Constable to comment that the defendant was
switched on boy”. The defendant’s aunty was present at the interview
as a support person and she acknowledged
that she believed the defendant knew
what the warnings meant.
[20] The Senior Constable also asked the defendant
to read a sentence from the Form 36 which had been provided to his support
The defendant had no difficulty in reading the sentence coherently.
Notably the sentence contained the words “inform you of
the identity of a
person and where he or she is going to be questioned”.
defendant was also questioned with regard to his understanding of right and
wrong and the responses which he gave in his
own words show that he knows the
difference between telling lies and telling the truth.
[22] When questioned
[23] He said that a few friends came to his home with the motorcycle.
They told him that a friend had loaned them the motorcycle,
but the defendant
told police that he did not believe this as any friend would not give such
permission. He was not asked where he
thought the motorcycle had come from. It
is the riding of the motorcycle as a pillion passenger which forms this charge
[24] The defendant went on to say that he did not have
permission to ride the bike as he did not know who owned it. He described how
the others had dumped the bike and came back around to the
[25] This case can be distinguished from
McCormick’s case on the basis that here there was no psychological report
and no direct
evidence from an educator other than the records from Cleveland
Education and Training Centre. Further, during the police interview,
questions and explanations with regard to warnings and the defendant’s
ability to distinguish between right and wrong were
not compromised as was the
case in McCormick.
[26] I have had the opportunity of observing the
defendant, both during the electronic record of interview and as he sat through
proceedings in court. He was engaged and shows an outward maturity for one
of his age.
[27] Having applied the relevant tests as set out in R v F, ex
parte Attorney General
, I am satisfied that
the prosecution has rebutted the presumption beyond a reasonable doubt and I
find the defendant does have capacity
to know what he did was
[28] Given all of the elements of the charge have been admitted,
including the defendant’s admission in the electronic record
of interview
that he rode the bike, I find the defendant guilty of the charge.
