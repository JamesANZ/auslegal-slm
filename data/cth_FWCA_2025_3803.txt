DEPUTY PRESIDENT WRIGHT
SYDNEY, 12 NOVEMBER 2025
Application for approval of the Bidfood Hervey Bay – Enterprise
Agreement 2025.
Introduction
Burleigh Marr Distributions Pty Ltd and
United Imports & Exports Co Pty Ltd trading as Bidfood Hervey Bay (the
Employer) has made
an application for approval of an enterprise agreement known
Bidfood Hervey Bay– Enterprise Agreement 2025
Agreement) pursuant to s.185 of the
Fair Work Act 2009
Act). The Agreement is a single enterprise agreement.
The Agreement explicitly excludes any applicable modern Awards under
clause 1.3.3. The following Awards would otherwise apply to employees
Storage Services and Wholesale Award 2020
(Storage Award), the
Road Transport and Distribution Award 2020
(Road Transport Award), the
Clerks – Private Sector Award 2020
(Clerks Award) and the
Commercial Sales Award 2020
(Commercial Sales Award).
Multiple employers
The Agreement covers two employers that appeared to be related
entities. The Form 17B appears to have been lodged on behalf of all
which appears to be inconsistent with r.32(3) of the
Fair Work Commission
which provides that each employer that is covered by the
agreement must lodge a declaration by the employer, in support of the
application,
with the Commission within 14 days after the day on which the
agreement is made. Further, there is only one NERR lodged with the
application.
The Employer provided submissions that the two employers are related
bodies corporate being wholly owned subsidiaries of Bidfood Australia
and both companies employ the employees at Bidfood Hervey Bay. Accordingly, the
Employer submits that they are a single interest
employer for the purpose of
s.172(5)(b) of the Act. Based on these submissions I am satisfied that it is
appropriate to dispense
with the requirement in r.32(3) in the circumstances.
Deductions – Overpayments
Clause 3.4.4 of the Agreement provides that the Employer may deduct
from any amount required up to a maximum of 10% of an employee’s
of pay for a week for the amount of any overpayment. This may not constitute a
permitted deduction in accordance with s.324
of the Act. As such a deduction
made pursuant to this term is likely to require the authorisation of the
relevant employee to comply
Inconsistencies with the National Employment Standards
The Commission raised the following issues with the Employer as to
whether some aspects of the Agreement are inconsistent with the
5.2.5(a) of the Agreement provides that an employee must give the Employer
notice of taking of leave as soon as practicable
(which may be a time after the
leave has started but at least two (2) hour notice of their absence prior to the
start of their shift).
This appears to provide a more stringent notice
requirement than permitted by s.107(2)(a) of the Act.
7.1.6 of the Agreement provides that employees may be required to undergo
absenteeism management plans, which may specify the
to substantiate personal leave and require employees to provide notice of
absence by certain deadlines.
This provision is stated to operate
notwithstanding any evidence requirements of the Act and therefore appears to
exclude the NES.
2.2 of the Agreement provides for notice periods including payment in lieu of
notice. Subclauses 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 appears to
be inconsistent with s.117 of the
Act as they may result in employees not receiving their full entitlement.
2.2.8 of the Agreement provides that if an Employee fails to give the notice
required on resignation or to work out the notice
then the Employer may deduct
from any monies due on termination under this Agreement, or the NES the amount
equivalent to the notice
period or the period of notice not worked. This raises
the issue of deductions from NES entitlements.
2.3.2 of the Agreement provides for circumstances where employees are not
entitled to redundancy benefits. This includes where
an employee agrees to
perform work in another role as an employee of the Employer after the
employee’s role is declared redundant,
however this provision does not
require an application to the Commission to vary redundancy obligations as
required by s.120 of the
2.6.2 of the Agreement states that an employee will be deemed to have abandoned
their employment if they have failed to attend
for 3 consecutive rostered
shifts. It is unclear from this clause whether they would be entitled to payment
of notice of termination
in accordance with ss. 117–123 of the Act
I am satisfied that in accordance with the NES precedence term in
Clause 1.3.4 of the Agreement, the above sections of the Agreement
will be read
and interpreted in conjunction with the NES.
Better off Overall Test (BOOT) Issues – Multiple Awards
The Commission raised the following issues with the Employer which
are relevant to whether employees are better off overall under
the Agreement
compared to the relevant Awards:
1. Clause 7 of the Agreement provides for an annualised salary clause in
compensation for shift work, weekend penalty rates, overtime,
allowances, annual
leave loading and public holidays. The rates of pay do not appear high enough to
compensate for these entitlements.
Further, there is no effective reconciliation
term in the Agreement in accordance with the decision in
Distributive and Allied Employees Association v Beechworth Bakery Employee Co
Pty Ltd t/a Beechworth
4.1.1 of the Agreement provides an extended span of hours for store workers
(5:00am to 7:30pm on Monday to Sunday) and drivers
(4:30am to 6:30pm on Monday
to Sunday; 4:30am to 7:30pm for casual drivers). Clause 13.1 of the Storage
Award provides that the ordinary
span of hours will be from 7:00am to 5:30pm on
Monday to Friday. Clause 13 of the Road Transport Award provides that ordinary
will be worked from 5:30am to 6:30pm on Monday to Friday. While the Awards
allow for the span of hours to be altered by up to one
hour at each end of the
spread, it does not allow the spread of hours to be expanded. The effect of this
is that some employees may
work ordinary hours under the Agreement that would be
considered as overtime under the Award.
4.1.4(d) of the Agreement states that the casual loading shall not be paid on
overtime. Employees are entitled to receive their
casual loading on overtime on
a cumulative basis under clause 21.1(d) of the Storage Award and clause 21.4(a)
of the Clerks Award.
4.1.4(d) of the Agreement provides casual loading is not paid on public
holidays. Clauses 22.1(d) of the Storage Award, 22.8
of the Road Transport
Award, and 4.1.4(d) of the Clerks Award provide casual loading on a cumulative
3.8.2 of the Agreement provides that ordinary hours performed on a Sunday will
be paid at 175%. Clauses 22.1 of the Storage
Award, 23 of the Road Transport
Award and 19 of the Commercial Sales Award provide for 200% for all hours worked
on a Sunday.
BOOT Issues – Storage Award
The Commission raised the following issues with the Employer which
are relevant to whether employees are better off overall under
the Agreement
than under the Storage Award:
3.7 of the Agreement provides that a morning shift will start between the hours
of 1:00am and 5:00am. Clause 20.1 of the Storage
Award provides that an early
morning shift commences between 2:00am and 7:00am. Under the Agreement it
appears that employees will
only be paid at ordinary rates instead of the
shiftwork penalty of 112.5% (clause 20.4(a)) where a shift starts between 5:00am
3.7 of the Agreement provides that an afternoon shift shall finish after 8:00pm
and at or before 1:00am. Clause 20.1 of the
Storage Award provides that an
afternoon shift finishes after 6:00pm and at or before midnight. Under the
Agreement it appears that
employees will only be paid at ordinary rates instead
of the shiftwork penalty of 115% (clause 20.4(b)) where a shift finishes between
6:00pm and 8:00pm whereas under the Storage Award employees would be entitled to
an afternoon shift penalty.
3.7 of the Agreement provides that a morning shift will start between the hours
of 1:00am and 5:00am and an afternoon shift
shall finish after 8:00pm and at or
before 1:00am. Clause 20.1 of the Storage Award provides that a night shift
finishes after midnight
and at or before 8:30am. Where a shift finishes between
1:00am and 8:30am under the Storage Award employees would be entitled to
night shift penalty of 130%, however under the Agreement employees will only be
afforded a 115% shift penalty where a shift finishes
before 1:00am or starts
between 1:00am and 5:00am.
BOOT Issues –
Road Transport Award
The Commission raised the following issues with the Employer which
are relevant to whether employees are better off overall under
the Agreement
than under the Road Transport Award:
4.1.1(b), 4.1.2(d) and 4.1.4(b) of the Agreement provide for maximum daily hours
of 10 hours per day, whereas clause 13 of
the Road Transport Award provides for
a maximum of 8 hours per day, where overtime rates would apply after 8 hours
worked under the
Award. Rates of pay for some full-time employees and all
part-time and casual employees (who may work reduced hours during the week
compensate) may not be high enough to compensate employees who work in excess of
8 hours per day.
3.7 of the Agreement provides that an afternoon shift shall finish after 8:00pm
and at or before 1:00am. Clause 22 of the Road
Transport Award provides that an
afternoon shift shall finish after 6:30pm and not later than 12:30am. Clause
4.1.1 of the Agreement
provides that the ordinary span of hours will be between
4:30am and 7:30pm on Monday to Sunday. Where a shift finishes between 6:30pm
7:30pm they would be entitled to afternoon shift penalty of 117.5% under the
Award, whereas under the Agreement this appears
to be paid at the ordinary rate.
3.7 of the Agreement provides that a morning shift will start between the hours
of 1:00am and 5:00am and an afternoon shift
shall finish after 8:00pm and at or
before 1:00am. Clause 22 of the Road Transport Award provides that a night shift
shall finish
after 12:30am and not later than 8:30am. It appears that a shift
that finishes between 12:30am and 1:00am, or between 5:00am and
8:30am under the
Agreement will receive a reduced penalty when compared against the Award
entitlement.
Agreement is silent on penalties where a shift worker works a pattern of shifts
that do not continue for at least five consecutive
afternoons or nights. Clause
22.10 of the Road Transport Award provides 150% for the first 3 hours and 200%
thereafter in these circumstances.
5.7 of the Agreement provides that work performed on a public holiday will be
paid at 250%. Clause 23.2 of the Road Transport
Award provides that where a
permanent employee or casual employee performs work outside of ordinary hours on
Good Friday and/or Christmas
Day they will be entitled to 300% for all hours
worked, and a casual employee will be entitled to casual loading in addition to
BOOT Issues – Clerks Award
The Commission raised the following issues with the Employer which
are relevant to whether employees are better off overall under
the Agreement
than under the Clerks Award:
3.7 of the Agreement provides that a morning shift will start between the hours
of 1:00am and 5:00am and an afternoon shift
shall finish after 8:00pm and at or
before 1:00am. Clause 25 of the Clerks Award provides that an afternoon shift
shall finish after
7:00pm and at or before midnight and a night shift shall
finish after midnight and at or before 7:00am. Under the Agreement it appears
that employees will receive a reduced penalty rate of 115% where a shift
finishes between midnight and 1:00am, and where a shift
finishes between 5:00am
and 7:00am when compared to the Award permanent night shift penalty of 130%.
4.2 of the Agreement provides that overtime worked from Monday to Saturday will
be paid at 150% for the first 3 hours and 200%
thereafter. Clause 21 of the
Clerks Award provides that all overtime worked between Monday and Saturday will
be paid at 150% for
the first 2 hours and 200% thereafter for day workers and
overtime worked in excess of daily hours for shift workers.
5.1.3 of the Agreement provides that annual leave loading will be paid at 17.5%,
whereas clause 32.3 of the Clerks Award provides
for 17.5% or the relevant
weekend or shift work penalty (whichever is greater).
3.9 of the Agreement provides entitlements to allowances however is silent on
some allowances in clause 19 of the Clerks Award
such as the laundry and living
away from home allowance.
Agreement appears to be silent on providing entitlements for employees working
during a meal break, inconsistent with clause 15.4
of the Clerks Award which
provides an employer must pay an employee who is required to work through their
meal break 200% of the
minimum hourly rate from when the meal break would have
commenced until a meal break is allowed.

submissions and undertakings to address the above BOOT issues. A copy of the

the Agreement. The undertakings are taken to be
a term of the

above, I am satisfied that each of the requirements of ss.186, 187, 188 and 190
as are relevant
to this application for approval have been met.
