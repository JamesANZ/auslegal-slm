Native Title Report

Reviewed by Rick Farley
There is more than a touch of thundery gloom about the
Native Title Report
July 1995 June 1996
of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social
Justice Commissioner. Mick Dodson argues that the Government's proposed
Native Title Act 1993
(Cth) ('the NTA') are an attack
on Indigenous rights, and display a 'profound reluctance, perhaps inability, to
accept native title
for what it is.
He uses the story of a senior old man's response to news of the
decision-different story, same ending-to background his attitude to the
Government's position.
It is easy to understand why he may be frustrated. Mr Dodson s problem is
that he sees a far broader agenda for the native title debate
Government. In his view, the Act is a framework agreement for a social contract
between Indigenous peoples and others. 'It
is a matter of social dynamics' he
says. 'The NTA is essentially about interaction between Indigenous and
non-Indigenous Australians'.
But the Government does not have such a wide approach to the matter. It
believes certainty in land dealings is of paramount importance,
and is achieved
best by reducing or constricting existing Indigenous rights under the NTA. That
is the fundamental difference between
Mick Dodson and the Government-one is
looking up to the sky, and the other is looking down at the ground.
Given the Government's majority, it is hard to escape the conclusion that
there will continue to be a huge gap between Mr Dodson's
aspirations for the Act
and those of the Government. According to a survey of Federal election
candidates by three universities,
72% of Coalition candidates believe Aboriginal
land rights have gone too far, compared to 6% of ALP candidates.
However, he poses some important questions for the Government. Some of them
will have to be addressed, if for no other reason than
that the issues aren't
going to go away, and there will be increasing international focus on
Australia's human rights record with
Indigenous peoples, particularly in the
lead-up to the 2000 Olympics.
From his wide perspective, Mr Dodson argues that if reconciliation is to be
achieved at all, it must start with land and with respect
for Indigenous rights
to land. He says the best foundation for enduring certainty regarding land use
lies in agreements, and that
failure to recognise this is one of the deepest
flaws in the Government's approach to the NTA.
He then points to a fact I believe is not widely understood within the
Government-the Preamble to the Act acknowledges that:
'The High Court has ... held that the common law of Australia recognises a
form of native title that reflects the entitlement of the
indigenous [sic]
inhabitants of Australia, in accordance with their laws and customs, to their
traditional lands'.
The common law recognised Indigenous law in
the Mabo [No. 2] (Mabo v
Queensland [No. 2]
[1992] HCA 23
(1992) 175 CLR 1)
judgment. This is the point that Noel
Pearson has made - Captain Cook brought the common law with him; it is
whitefella law which
has recognised the existence and continued application of
blackfella law. Indigenous native title rights now are embedded in the
law, and those rights are protected by the
Racial Discrimination Act 1975
The report builds the proposition that common law recognition that native
title rights are defined by Indigenous laws and customs
means that they should
not be treated the same way as other titles. That is where Mr Dodson is on a
collision course with the Government:
'A further generic or thematic element of the Government's approach ... is
the insistence that any native title right or interest
which is unknown to other
common law titles must be a gift of government, which can be reduced or removed
by government at will'.
He makes his views on the amendments very clear:
'The operational efficiency of an Act designed to recognise and protect
native title is considered almost exclusively from the perspective
property owners.'
'The primary concern is not the function of the right [to negotiate] in
protecting the unique and vulnerable nature of native interests,
potential to act "as a brake on mineral exploration and mining activity"
Mr Dodson focuses on amendments in relation to pastoral leases and the right
to negotiate to illustrate his case. On any reading,
the amendments would
increase the rights of pastoralists and reduce the rights of any native title
holders. I was the Executive Director
of the National Farmers' Federation when
the Act was negotiated, and know that Aboriginal people made a very significant
to pastoralists. As part of the negotiations, it was agreed that
pastoral leases should be renewed automatically on the same terms
and conditions
which currently exist, without any right to negotiate by native title claimants.
That facility still is not available
to the mining industry. I do not think
Aboriginal people will accept easily that the already big concession to
pastoralists should
be extended further.
For their part at the time, the National Farmers' Federation agreed in return
that pastoral leases purchased commercially by Aboriginal
interests should be
able to be converted to a form of native title. However, events have superseded
Mr Dodson's initial concerns
on the pastoral lease amendments.
Debate on the package of amendments to the NTA has been delayed, and probably
won't get to the final Senate stages until April 1997
at the earliest. In the
meantime, the High Court will bring down its decision in the
That decision will clarify some issues, at least in regard to pastoral leases
which have no existing reservations of Indigenous
interest. It is unlikely that
the Court will clarify all possible issues. Whatever the decision, the
Government will have to review
the pastoral lease amendments, and changes are
likely. (One of the few areas of agreement from the Parliamentary Joint
on Native Title was that the pastoral lease issues should not be
considered at this time.)
The Social Justice Commissioner also has a significant problem with the
cascading effect of the proposed changes to the right to negotiate.
He points to
the requirement to obtain endorsement from a representative body; a higher
registration test; potential strike out proceedings
in the Federal Court; and a
three month time limit to pass the registration test. He then concludes:
'If the impact of all these proceedings is considered from the perspective of
native title claimants, the drain on their human and
financial resources, the
proposals must be seen to be unworkable. They severely curtail the effectiveness
of the right to negotiate,
quite apart from those Government proposals which
would severely limit or remove that right'.
However, Mr Dodson does agree with some Government amendments, such as:
increased responsibilities for Native Title Representative Bodies (providing
their resources also are increased);
recognition of Indigenous Land Use Agreements (although he argues that they
should be signed off by a representative body); and
the need to improve mediation processes (although warning that the key
problem inherent in the mediation process is its vulnerability
imbalances between the parties).
Well, where to from here?
Mr Dodson, other Indigenous bodies, the Federal Opposition, the Democrats and
the Greens will argue that the current amendments are
inconsistent with the
Racial Discrimination Act 1975
(Cth). The positions taken by Senators
Harradine and Colston will be critical, although the odds are they are more
likely to side
with the Opposition. If that turns out to be the case, then some
negotiations no doubt will occur in the Senate. It would appear
that only those
amendments which are supported both by industry and Indigenous representatives
will pass the Senate easily. (The
different interests were brought together by
the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation during 1996, and some good
communication channels
were opened. They will be used again.)
Whatever the eventual outcome, some realities remain:
the Government has very little sympathy for a broad Aboriginal agenda;
therefore, the focus is likely to shift to the courts.
Whatever the form of the NTA, it remains open to Indigenous peoples to test
their common law rights;
there is a range of other legal mechanisms created by Commonwealth and State
legislation by which Indigenous peoples can assert and
protect their interests
industry is light years ahead of government in recognising that agreements
should be the preferred first option to resolve native
title claims, and
probably can advocate such an approach more effectively to the Government than
Indigenous interests.
In the last analysis, the Indigenous land agenda simply won't go away. If
Australia is ever to become a harmonious society, and escape
divisions which exist almost everywhere else in the world, the Aboriginal land
agenda must be accommodated. The Social
Justice Commissioner's
Native Title
pleads for understanding of that fact. But one senses Mr Dodson
isn't holding his breath.
