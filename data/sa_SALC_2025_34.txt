His Honour Judge BP
DELIVERED ON:
CATCHWORDS:
Application for review –

to make submissions
– The applicant responded but sent the submissions to the wrong email
address and the delegate proceeded
on that basis that no submissions were
advanced – The delegate upheld the objection lodged by police and refused
the application
for approval. – On review the submissions were accepted as
fresh evidence – The submissions include impressive references
persons who are of themselves self‑evidently of good character –
that although the public would rightly have concerns about the

references, that concern would be allayed by the grant of an interim approval
over an extended period –

allowed and in lieu of the rejection of the applicant’s application the
applicant is granted
interim approval for a period of two years with the police
having liberty to apply –
Liquor Licensing Act
REPRESENTATION:
Applicant: Mr J
Ryan & Co Solicitors
Respondent: Acting Sergeant M
Commissioner for Police
is an application for review made by the applicant, Anthony Mark Farrugia, in
connection with a decision by the delegate of the
Liquor and Gambling
Commissioner (the delegate) to refuse an application for approval as a
responsible person for the purposes of
Liquor Licensing Act
delegate granted Mr Farrugia interim approval on 12 March 2024 for a period
of 6 months. In connection with this, the Commissioner
of Police (the
Police Commissioner) intervened, contending that the application be refused on
account of Mr Farrugia’s criminal
history, which included the offences of
aggravated assault against a child or spouse and assault occasioning actual
bodily harm.
Police Commissioner contended that in light of these offence there was a serious
question as to Mr Farrugia’s reputation,
honesty and integrity and that
his application for approval under the Act should have been refused.
delegate considered this and on the understanding that Mr Farrugia had not
placed any submissions challenging or putting a different
light on what the
Police Commissioner was contending, the delegate refused the application for
approval. The delegate thought that
there needed to be greater distance between
the offending and the application and more evidence in support of
Mr Farrugia’s
reformed character.
it transpired Mr Farrugia had prepared submissions for the delegate’s
consideration. Unfortunately they were sent to the
wrong email address, which is
why the delegate never received them.
the circumstances I am prepared to receive the submissions in dealing with this
application for review.
Farrugia’s submissions include various character references. All are very
impressive. One spoke of him being “an honest
and generous person with a
sound business and relationship understanding”. Another spoke of him as
being “calm and professional”
in his interactions with customers.
Yet another spoke of him having “earned the respect and trust of both
staff, customers,
suppliers and management through his unwavering commitment to
excellence and his ability to handle responsibilities with the utmost
reliability”.
of the referees are persons who are themselves self-evidently of good character
and in positions to make considered assessments
of Mr Farrugia’s
now turn to consider Mr Farrugia’s offending history.
Farrugia’s was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm,
occurred in 1995. For this he received a suspended
sentence of
6 months’ imprisonment.
2019 he was found guilty without conviction of aggravated assault without a
weapon against a child or spouse.
Farrugia has had no further legal issues since 2019.
1995 offending was plainly serious. This Court is permitted to know that
sentence of imprisonment, albeit suspended, reflects
serious criminal conduct.
But it is significant that it occurred 30 years ago.
2019 offending was plainly of a much less serious nature.
my opinion, whilst the public would be rightfully concerned about
Mr Farrugia’s fitness and propriety, having regard to the
character references, that concern could be allayed by putting him on a short
lead by granting him interim approval only
for an extended period. I note that
this is supported by the Police Commissioner and is not opposed by Mr Farrugia.
His willingness
to be subjected to this reinforces my confidence that he can be
trusted to discharge the duties and responsibilities expected of
a responsible
person under the Act.
therefore set aside the delegate’s refusal of Mr Farrugia’s
application for approval and substitute it with an approval
on an interim basis
for two years, with the police having liberty to apply. If there is no
application made by the police over that
period, the approval will be made on an
ongoing basis as the end of the two‑year
