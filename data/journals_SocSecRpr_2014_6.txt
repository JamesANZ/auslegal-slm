Age pension overpayment: requirements for waiver due to administrative
error; application of discretion to waive a debt because of
circumstances
MACHIELSE and SECRETARY to the DSS
Decided: 21st October 2013 by K. Hogan
Machielse received age pension from July 2008. On 23 May 2012 a Centrelink
officer decided to raise and recover a debt of $18,485.46
for the period 11
March 2010 to 2 May 2012 because his wife’s income had not been taken into
account in calculating his rate
of pension. Machielse appealed this decision
unsuccessfully to a Centrelink authorised review officer and the Social Security
Tribunal. He then appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
Just before the debt period, his wife’s income was recorded by
Centrelink as $1,208 per fortnight, and Machielse was therefore
not required to
report her income fortnightly to receive the age pension. In fact her income was
higher than this, which had led
to an earlier debt.
Apparently in response to this, Centrelink had removed the record of $1,208
per fortnight, and instead required Machielse to report
his wife’s income
fortnightly. But on 26 April 2010, Centrelink had sent Machielse a letter
telling him he did not have to
report income fortnightly, without reinstating a
recorded amount for his wife’s income.
From that point, Machielse was paid the age pension at a rate that did not
take into account his wife’s income.
There was no dispute that Machielse had been overpaid and had a debt. The
issue was whether recovery of the debt should be waived.
The Administrative
Appeals Tribunal considered the two main grounds of debt waiver:
(a) Waiver of the proportion of a debt which is solely attributable to
administrative error under
Social Security Act 1991
(the Act); and
(b) Waiver of a debt if there are special circumstances and the debt did not
result wholly or partly from the debtor or another person
knowingly making a
false statement or failing to comply with the Act under
Decision and reasons
Waiver of debts solely attributable to Centrelink
The Tribunal discussed the meaning and application of this provision. It
said, in effect, that although
of the Act allows the
‘proportion’ of a debt to be waived, this only permitted waiver of a
proportion of a debt if, over
the time period it related to, the debt was solely
attributable to Centrelink error. It did not allow waiver of a proportion of a
debt where, over that time period, it was partly attributable to Centrelink
error and partly not.
Although the Tribunal considered that there were arguably errors in this
case, it found that throughout the debt period the debt was
partly attributable
to Machielse’s failure to advise of his wife’s correct income in
accordance with his obligations
and therefore there was no proportion of the
debt solely attributable to Centrelink error.
Waiver where there were special
circumstances
In effect, the Tribunal found that Machielse did not know he was being
overpaid until 25 June 2010 as, up to that point, he had been
overseas and not
using his bank accounts. It found, without much explanation, that he knew he was
being overpaid from 25 June 2010.
It appears the Tribunal drew this inference
from his knowledge that his rate of pension had significantly increased once
removed his wife’s regular income from his record.
It found that the debt should be waived up to 25 June 2010 because Machielse
had special circumstances, but the debt could not be
waived from 25 June 2010
because the Tribunal was not satisfied that Machielse did not knowingly fail to
comply with his obligation
under the Act to tell Centrelink about his
wife’s income.
Formal decision
The Tribunal varied the decision of the SSAT and referred the matter back to
Centrelink to recalculate the amount of the debt in accordance
Tribunal’s findings.
Contributor’s note:
Overall, this decision is an orthodox application of the law relating to
waiver of debts.
Its interest lies in an extended discussion of the proper approach to the
application of
of the Act. It rejects a line of argument about the
application of this provision suggested by the word ‘proportion’
that section. The problem is that ‘proportion’ is ambiguous and
could mean either a proportion of the total debt worked
out over the whole of
the debt period or a proportion of the debt period worked out by reference to a
period of time within that
debt period. The Tribunal, correctly in the
author’s view, says that only the second approach is possible under
and then, only if the debt is solely attributable to Centrelink error
for that shorter period of time.
The Tribunal, unfortunately, also seems to suggest (at [57]) that
constructive knowledge may suffice to preclude application of waiver
of the Act. This would be legal error, reviewable in the Federal
Court. However, accepting that a reviewing court is not to review
reasons why
with an ‘eye keenly attuned to the perception of error’
(Collector of Customs v Pressure Tankers Pty Ltd and Pozzolanic Enterprises
[1993] FCA 456
(1993) 43 FCR 280)
, it may be that a fair reading of the reasons is
that ultimately the Tribunal found as fact that Machielse knew of the error
of the substantial increase in his rate of pension. (
an alternative view is that the Tribunal did not make a finding that
Machielse knew of the error but that
requires the decisionmaker to
reach a positive state of satisfaction that the person did not knowingly fail to
comply with an obligation,
whilst the Tribunal in this case could not reach a
positive state of satisfaction on the evidence before it. This is implied from
the Tribunal’s statements that:...
the Tribunal is unable to find that the applicant was not in a position to
have dealt with the various notices and correspondence
issued to him by
Centrelink after 25 June 2010. Consequently, the Tribunal is unable to find that
the applicant did not knowingly
fail to comply with a provision of the Act in
the period following 25 June 2010.)
