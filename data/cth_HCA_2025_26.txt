question – is

on a question of law. If there is in force a certificate as specified in
certifying that the disclosure of matter contained in a document

necessary to ensure that the matter is not disclosed to any person other than a

to be re-opened and overruled.
response, the second defendant, the
Commonwealth,
submitted that
provides a complete answer to the plaintiff's case and should not be
re-opened. The Commonwealth alternatively proposed that, if
the Court were to
and were to consider
to be invalid, it would be
reasonably open to construe
as Steward J proposed in
which would enable the Federal Court to adopt several strategies to
avoid or ameliorate any practical injustice in an appeal to it
as referred to in
the reasons which follow the Commonwealth's principal submission, that
provides a complete answer to the plaintiff's case and should not be
re-opened, is correct.
Full Court of the Federal Court, from which the appeal was brought to this Court
had declared that
"is a valid law of the
Commonwealth".
The parties
joined issue on the appeal to this Court as to whether: (a)
was valid or invalid in its
(b) alternatively,
was to be construed in accordance with
Acts Interpretation Act
(Cth) to mean that
the Federal Court must "do all things necessary
in the due exercise of
judicial power
to ensure that the ... matter is not disclosed to any person"
other than a member of the court as constituted for the purposes of
proceeding.
Keane and Gleeson JJ concluded that
was valid in its
and that the
arguments in support of its invalidity involved a "fatal
artificiality".
Honours put it,
"considered as a whole, does not disadvantage a person
in the position of the appellant: it simply offers that person a statutory
remedy in addition to the remedies otherwise provided by law, that additional
remedy being attended with forensic consequences different
from those attending
those other remedies".
these circumstances, their Honours were satisfied that
impose any practical injustice on the appellant and was valid.
contrast, Gageler J concluded that
was invalid in its entirety
on the basis that it compelled a court "never to disclose the certified
information to a party or to
a legal representative of a party irrespective of
the degree of relevance or perceived relevance of the information to the
of an issue in the appeal and irrespective of the degree of prejudice
to security or the defence or international relations of Australia
result from disclosure to that party or legal
representative".
Accordingly, his Honour concluded that "the blanket proscription by
of disclosure of information ... renders the process by which the
Federal Court is to hear and determine an appeal under
procedurally unfair"
thereby incompatible with Ch III of the
Constitution
and invalid in
consequence.
concluded that
was "wholly
on the basis
that the section "impermissibly excludes procedural fairness for a whole class
of case by removing the ability of the
Federal Court to respond to potential
'practical injustice'"
and forbids "the Court in any and every case from making any certified matter
available to the applicant or any representative of
applicant".
concluded that

and that it was

Federal Court pursuant to

consequence that the Federal Court could refuse to admit the documents or admit
them only on conditions agreed to by the
respondent.
Steward J also considered that the fact that the power of the Federal Court
to ensure an applicant has a fair opportunity to know
the evidence would not be
available in every case (because the "certified material may be so sensitive
that any form of disclosure
would be too dangerous") did not mean that
was invalid by operation of Ch III of the
Constitution
Rather, and consistently with the reasoning of Kiefel CJ, Keane and
Gleeson JJ, Steward J considered that because the right of appeal
the Federal Court on a question of law which
was itself a beneficial aspect of the overall statutory scheme, an applicant
under that provision suffered no "practical
injustice" by reason of
reasons, Steward J agreed with the making of the orders proposed by
Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ dismissing the
follows that the plaintiff's submission that no
ratio decidendi

Constitution
is incorrect. It was necessary

that four Justices
(Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ, and Steward J) held that
, in its application to documents in respect of which there is a
certificate in accordance with s 39B(2), did not infringe Ch III
Constitution
because, as the Commonwealth submitted in the present
case, "even where
prevents the Federal Court from
providing an applicant with any means to respond to material subject to a
certificate ... , it is
not contrary to Ch III because it forms
an inseverable part of an
avenue for review that is beneficial
(when compared to the other available avenues of review), and therefore causes
no practical
injustice".
In respect of the statutory and factual situation it resolved, that is
ratio decidendi
is true that Steward J also said in
that "[b]ecause the duty
and the capacity of the Court to provide different forms of procedural fairness,
of the kind described above,
are not necessarily precluded by
, it is a valid law" and "[i]f it were otherwise ... I may
well have formed the view that

These observations,
however, cannot alter the fact that what was ultimately essential to
Steward J agreeing with the making of the
orders dismissing the appeal, and
leaving undisturbed the Full Court's declaration, was his Honour's conclusion
that even in a case
strictly applied in accordance with its
terms it did not result in an applicant suffering any practical injustice
because the provision
forms part of an otherwise beneficial regime providing an
applicant with a "meaningful ... chance of independent review with
oversight".

Leave to re-open

Queensland v The Commonwealth

the substance of the plaintiff's "means and ends" or "proportionality"
contention, as now framed, is that the "end" or object
pursues is "prevention of the disclosure of information where that
disclosure would be injurious to the public interest because it
would prejudice
the security of Australia or involve the disclosure of deliberations or
decisions of the Cabinet". The plaintiff
contends that
means to achieve this end, is inflexible, operating in every case irrespective
of all other countervailing considerations
in that case. The essence of this
complaint, however, is not new – it was captured in the
submissions put for the appellant
. In that case the appellant
submitted, and the minority accepted, that the constitutional invalidity of
sprang from its "rigidity", inflexibility, and exclusion of the
Federal Court's capacity to weigh any countervailing interest in
As explained, that
submission was not accepted by Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ, nor

argument was overlooked

, by majority of 4:3, dismissed that appeal. The plaintiff in this
matter now seeks to raise the very same question. Yet nothing has
changed since
was decided except the constitution of this Court.
and importantly, Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ, and Steward J
(on the one hand) and Gageler J, Gordon J, and Edelman J (on
other hand) all accepted that an essential characteristic of a Ch III court
is that it provides parties with procedural fairness.
All the Justices also
proceeded on the basis that procedural fairness is concerned with "practical
injustice" to a party in the case,
not abstract conceptions of possible
unfairness.
difference between the approaches of Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ,
and of Steward J (on the one hand) and Gageler J, Gordon
Edelman J (on the other hand) was that: (a) the former considered that
the question of "practical injustice" was to be determined
in both the specific
statutory context and the broader context of the options available to a person
(relevantly, to challenge a decision
of the Tribunal) and that
affects the exercise of only one of those options, whereas
(b) the latter considered that the question of "practical injustice" was
be determined in the context that the specific right conferred to which
applies is a right of appeal to a Ch III court.
This difference in focus yielded different answers to the question whether
worked a practical injustice. The appellant in
obtained an unfavourable answer to that question, the plaintiff in this case now
seeks to obtain a different answer to precisely
the same question.
it is not the case, as the plaintiff would have it, that the reasoning of
Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ in
assumes "that the
content of procedural fairness can be reduced to nothing if the substantive
right is sourced in statute". No such
general proposition is apparent from the
joint reasons. Their Honours did not express any free-standing principle to the
effect that
the content of procedural fairness can be reduced to nothing if the
substantive right is sourced in statute. It is also not the case
that, as the
plaintiff would have it, the reasoning of Kiefel CJ, Keane and
Gleeson JJ in
"assumes that a public interest immunity claim
over certified material would inevitably be upheld" in judicial review
proceedings.
Their Honours said no more than it was "likely" that in judicial
review proceedings the doctrine of public interest immunity would
have resulted
in neither the Federal Court nor the appellant having access to the material the
subject of the
certificate.
and as apparent from the third and fourth points, the issue determined in
is not invalid by reason of
Ch III of the
Constitution

integrity of Ch III courts, does not concern any principle of
constitutional interpretation
or the meaning of any constitutional provision. It
also does not concern the formulation of any general principle of procedural

interpretative principles to one statutory provision applying

proceeding in the Federal Court – an appeal on a question of law from
a decision of the Tribunal or a referral
of such a question where there is in
force a certificate in accordance with the provisions identified in
certifying that "the disclosure of matter contained in the document would be
contrary to the public interest". The differences in
reasoning between the
judgments in

to "do all things necessary to ensure that
the [certified] matter is not disclosed to any person other than a member of the

by the ASIO Minister,
Federal Court followed the requirement of

documents and the "closed" part of the reasons of the Tribunal, documents and
reasons that SDCV and his legal

allegations and evidence about which SDCV and his legal representatives had not

in this procedure.
narrowest, and with respect most principled, approach taken in the majority in
this Court in
was that of Steward J. As explained in detail
below, Steward J differed in his approach in significant respects from the
other three
members of the majority (Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ)
because he recognised that, in some circumstances, practical injustice
arise from the operation of a provision that denied procedural fairness to an
applicant even if the applicant had other, potentially
less beneficial, routes
of review. But Steward J considered that
did not cause
practical injustice because it was a beneficial provision within a scheme that
provided for the possibility of amelioration
of the denial of procedural
fairness, albeit in ways not accepted by the plurality.
a high level of generality, it is possible to identify a ratio decidendi in
. That ratio decidendi is capable of strong justification. But at low
levels of generality, important to the procedure to be applied
by lower courts
when certified documents are transmitted to a court under
decision in
has no ratio decidendi. In many cases, this might be a
powerful reason to re-open a decision, even if only to re-explain the result
a way that would provide clarity and guidance for lower courts. Initially I was
strongly inclined to do so if clear guidance could
be provided. Ultimately,
however, a clear restatement by this Court of the ratio decidendi of
will have to await another case.
answer to the principal question in this special case is that
is not invalid on the basis that it infringes Ch III of
Constitution
. The creation of principles for the application of that
provision at lower levels of generality will be left, for the time being,
development by lower courts.
How this issue arises in this
special case
the individual appellant in
, the plaintiff in this special case is a
corporation providing a carriage service pursuant to the
Telecommunications
(Cth). Following an adverse security assessment by the
Director-General of Security in connection with s 315A of the
Telecommunications Act
, the Minister for Home Affairs, being the ASIO
Minister, certified under s 38A(3) of the
that she was
satisfied that the disclosure of certain information to the plaintiff, or its
directors or its employees, would be prejudicial
to the interests of security.
The plaintiff was given a notice of the adverse security assessment and a
statement of grounds.
plaintiff applied under
for a review by the
Tribunal of the adverse security assessment. Prior to the hearing by the
Tribunal of the plaintiff's application,
the ASIO Minister partially revoked the
certificate issued under s 38A(3) of the
, permitting partial
disclosure of information in the statement of grounds not previously disclosed
due to the certificate. The plaintiff
was provided with a revised unclassified
statement of grounds.
plaintiff's hearing before the Tribunal was heavily constrained. This was
because, prior to the hearing, the ASIO Minister issued
three certificates under
ss 39A and 39B of the
. The first certificate certified that
the disclosure, including by way of evidence or submissions, of the information
and contents
of specified documents, and other specified information, would be
contrary to the public interest because it would prejudice the
security of
Australia within ss 39A(8) and 39B(2)(a) of the
relation to two of those documents, involve the disclosure of deliberations or
decisions of the Cabinet within s 39B(2)(b)
. The second
and third certificates certified that the disclosure, including by way of
evidence or submissions, of the information
and contents of specified documents,
and other specified information, would be contrary to the public interest
because it would prejudice
the security of Australia within ss 39A(8) and
39B(2)(a) of the
s 39A(9) of the
, the Minister did not consent to the plaintiff
or its representatives being present when that evidence was adduced or those
submissions
made. After a four-day hearing, at which the certified information
and documents were not disclosed to the plaintiff or its legal
representatives,
the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review pursuant to
. The Tribunal provided "open" reasons to the
plaintiff and the Director-General of Security and "closed" reasons only to the
Director-General,
pursuant to s 43AAA(5) of the
plaintiff brought a proceeding under
Federal Court of Australia alleging error of law in the decision of the
Tribunal. In this special case, the plaintiff challenges
the validity of
which precludes the disclosure by the Federal
Court to the plaintiff, or its legal representatives, of the certified
issue that arises in this proceeding is, therefore, as the Commonwealth submits,
the "precise issue" that was considered in
ratio decidendi of a decision
at lower levels of the judicial hierarchy are generally bound by the rationes
decidendi ("reasons for deciding") of a court
at a higher level in the judicial
hierarchy. As a general proposition, the rationes decidendi are the rules of law
treated by the
judge or judges as
to support the
orders made based on the material facts before the
Since "in common
law judicial reasoning a ratio is rarely spelled out explicitly" by the judge,
the task for a later court in identifying
the binding rules of law is to
interpret what "the judge
must logically
have considered necessary or
treated as material".
Even in the rare case where a ratio decidendi is positively expressed by a
judge, that statement is not conclusive. A later court
might determine that it
was expressed at the wrong level of generality: either too low or too high.
Whether the subsequent restatement
of the ratio decidendi should be described as
the new ratio decidendi or, as McHugh J
the new "rule
of the case" is semantic.
material facts can be expressed at different levels of generality, so too can
the rules of law based on those
"[i]t might not have seemed sensible to confine the ratio of
(1932) to dead snails in ginger beer bottles; but it might have
been sensible to confine it to deleterious foreign matter, undetectable
consumption, in articles of food or drink. In fact it has been understood much
more broadly, as a general foundation for the
law of negligence."
In many cases, therefore, it would not merely be a "near‑miracle" for
judicial discourse to yield only one possible ratio decidendi:
it would be
"logically impossible".
Different rationes decidendi can be identified depending upon the generality at
which the relevant facts are
identified.
complication arises in the identification of a ratio decidendi of a decision of
an appellate court which is composed of multiple
judges who give separate
judgments. On a narrow view, where a ratio decidendi is treated as the essential
reasons that are common
to a majority of the appellate judges, expressed with a
high degree of particularity, it has sometimes been thought that it is possible
for a decision to have no ratio decidendi. But even on that view, a ratio
decidendi does not exhaust the binding effect of a decision.
For instance,
seriously considered obiter dicta of this Court, which by any definition is not
part of a ratio decidendi, is binding
Indeed, that very
rule of precedent, as enunciated by this Court in obiter dicta, could not be
binding on lower courts unless such
a rule were accepted. Hence, as
McHugh J said in
Re Tyler; Ex parte
of decisions
which might be thought to have no ratio decidendi in the narrow sense:
"that does not mean that the doctrine of stare decisis has no relevance or that
the decisions in those cases have no authority as
precedents ... But what is
meant by saying that a case, whose ratio decidendi cannot be discerned, is
authority for what it decided?
It cannot mean that a court bound by that
decision is bound only by the precise facts of the case ... the true rule is
that a court,
bound by a previous decision whose ratio decidendi is not
discernible, is bound to apply that decision when the circumstances of
instant case 'are not reasonably distinguishable from those which gave rise to
the decision'".
is, however, a broader view of a ratio decidendi that has been applied to
multi-member appellate courts. On a broader view,
a ratio decidendi can be
identified at a high level of generality, even coming close to an expression of
the result itself. For instance,
even if different members of a majority differ
in all aspects of their dispositive reasoning, a ratio decidendi at a high level
generality would involve the formulation of a legal rule that respected the
necessary aspects of the reasoning of all the members
of the majority. As
Goodhart explained, a ratio decidendi can emerge from a decision even if "the
rules of law set forth by the different
judges may have no relation to each
other"; a ratio decidendi is the "principle which can be discovered on proper
The principle
of the case "is not necessarily found in either the reasoning of the court or in
the proposition of law set
Hence, even if
three appellate judges gave entirely divergent reasoning for allowing an
appeal—judge 1 based the orders on
fact A; judge 2 based the orders
on fact B; and judge 3 based the orders on fact C—the ratio

said, "orthodox".

Gleeson JJ and a separate judgment of Steward J. The other members
this Court, including myself, were in dissent. Their reasons must be put to one
side when determining the ratio
plurality's reasons
Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ relied heavily upon the existence of
alternative routes open to SDCV to institute judicial
proceedings challenging
his adverse security assessment to which
did not apply. For
instance, SDCV "might have challenged the Tribunal's decision in proceedings for
judicial review under
Constitution
Judiciary Act 1903
By contrast,
however, a proceeding for error of law under
provided SDCV with a "forensic
advantage".
The forensic
advantage identified was not the (vanishingly small) gap between, on the one
hand, a proceeding for a material error
of law and, on the other hand, a
proceeding for judicial review which usually requires jurisdictional error.
Rather, the forensic
advantage was considered to arise because
required the documents before the Tribunal to be
transmitted to, and made available to be considered by, the Federal Court
provisions determined what material might be before the Federal
). By contrast, the
process of tender in a judicial review proceeding would have meant that "public
interest immunity would likely
have prevented the use of the certificated matter
by the Federal Court".
The net effect, therefore, was said to be a lack of "practical injustice" to
SDCV due to SDCV's own choices. As the plurality expressed
"One cannot maintain the proposition that one has been subjected to a practical
impediment by reason of the presence of a known obstacle
on the path that one
has chosen to pursue."
"practical impediment" was being used by the plurality as a euphemism for the
injustice of a proceeding in which central accusations
and evidence might not be
seen by an applicant, then I confess that I find this reasoning very difficult
to understand. If an accused
person charged with a petty crime were to gamble on
the choice of a novel court proceeding, which might be thought less likely to
result in conviction but in which the penalty was amputation of a limb, would
the plurality really say that there could be no injustice
because the accused
chose the proceeding for a "forensic advantage"? And if the answer to that
(fortunately) rhetorical question
is "no", then why is the result any different
if the injustice involves a process with some Kafkaesque elements of secrecy
than the amputation of a limb?

Steward J's assessment of the scheme in which
operated, essential aspects of his Honour's reasoning differed
from the reasoning of the plurality. In the very opening of his Honour's
reasons, after expressing agreement with the conclusion reached by the
plurality, his Honour then
"I, otherwise, and with very great respect, differ with some parts of the
reasons of Kiefel CJ, Keane and Gleeson JJ. Those differences

Australia from affording such a fair opportunity [to respond to evidence

that opening onwards, the reasons of Steward J consistently and repeatedly
tied his conclusion that

particular scheme in which
operated. Steward J began his
reasons by saying that "[t]here are narrow circumstances where a court may
justifiably deny an applicant
a fair opportunity to respond to evidence deployed
against them without causing 'practical
injustice'".
His Honour then explained how

circumstances by a consideration of the scheme of which

with Steward J's focused consideration of the scheme of which

particular context of
His Honour recognised that, although
"in a given case" an applicant for relief under

Steward J's careful assessment of the scheme of which
part, his Honour's interpretation differed in three very important respects
from that of the plurality. In the first two
of those respects, the reasoning of
Steward J, which was essential to his Honour's conclusion, was
inconsistent with that of the
his Honour's interpretation differed from the reasons of the plurality
concerning the "forensic advantage" that their Honours had
identified. Unlike
the plurality, Steward J conceived of the operation of
involving the supply of documents to the Federal Court but not obliging the
Court "to receive them into evidence or otherwise
to consider
"It is the act of
tendering the documents and having them adduced into evidence that places them
before the Court".
the present special case, there was lengthy argument about the consequences and
effect of this approach of Steward J to
A requirement for
tender of documents has the consequence that a court might refuse the tender.
For instance, in a proceeding under
Director-General of Security had sought to tender certified documents that had
been transmitted to the Federal Court from
the Tribunal then, arguably subject
to waiver by the applicant, the Court might have refused the tender of those
documents on the
basis that their receipt would have created manifest unfairness
to the applicant since
would have precluded the applicant or their
legal representatives from seeing the documents. Independently of other rules of
including those contained in the
Evidence Act 1995
cognate legislation,
courts have broad and general express or implied statutory powers (sometimes
confusingly described as
) to protect
their own processes,
which include the power to exclude evidence based upon extreme
unfairness,
even short of
the gross injustice that could substantially impair the institutional integrity
of a court.
power to exclude evidence to protect the processes of a court exists within the
same court armoury as the power to grant a stay
of proceedings. When speaking of
the injustice caused to an accused person by undue delay, Mason CJ observed
Jago v District Court
"[t]here is no reason to confine the discretionary power of the courts by
arbitrarily stipulating that a stay is the only proper
remedy for undue delay"
and that "it is important to bear in mind that the court may mould its order to
meet the exigencies of the
particular case".
his reasons in
, Steward J referred to a further possibility
short of excluding the certified documents entirely. Where a respondent to an
of law proceeding under
sought to tender certified material, "it
would be open to the Court to require, as a condition of admission into
evidence, those
documents, or parts of those documents, to be shown to an
applicant's legal representatives on a confidential
At a further
hearing of the present case, the Commonwealth submitted that in the event that a
respondent rejects that condition,

Constitution
, which would require the documents to be admitted if
relevant unless they were excluded by public interest immunity or another
In those circumstances, the documents would be closely scrutinised by
the court and there would be no doubt that any proper exclusion
interest immunity would be proportionate to the legitimate interests that the
immunity protects.
same power by which a court could exclude the documents entirely must also
permit the admission of the documents on condition.
The power to impose such a
condition depends upon an interpretation of
that treats conduct by
the Director‑General to allow a plaintiff's legal representatives to view
the documents, following a
condition upon tender imposed by the court (that the
consequence of a tender of documents must not deprive a party of procedural
fairness), as not involving the
doing anything other than ensuring
"that the matter is not disclosed to any person other than a member of the court
as constituted
for the purposes of the proceeding".
a further respect in which the reasons of Steward J differed from those of
the plurality was that his Honour held that "it was possible
Federal Court to appoint a special advocate who could examine certified material
and unredacted reasons and make independent
submissions to the
reached that conclusion by recognising that a special advocate would be an
"officer of the court", a person to whom disclosure
could be made within the
contrast, the plurality held that "
construed to allow the appointment of special counsel to whom the matter the
subject of ministerial certificates might
disclosed".
a potential inconsistency with the reasons of the plurality arises in so far as
Steward J held that so long as a disclosure did
not reveal the certified
matters, "it would be open to the Court to order that the gist of certified
documents be disclosed by the
Director-General to an
applicant".
Although the
plurality did not reject this possibility, their Honours diminished it by
reasoning, by analogy with criminal cases
involving informants, that "the gist
of the information will often suffice to identify the
informant".
reasoning was not supported by the authority cited in which the Supreme Court of
the United Kingdom considered that gisting
in some cases is not possible without
ratio decidendi by combining the reasons of the plurality and
ratio decidendi of
can be identified which is inconsistent with
those matters that were essential to Steward J's reasons, namely that it
was the particular
operation of the scheme of which
formed a part
that was beneficial and involved no practical injustice, including the three
mechanisms rejected or (in the third instance)
diminished by the plurality:
(i) a tender requirement; (ii) availability of a special advocate; and
(iii) the power to reveal the
gist of certified information without
revealing the certified content.
the narrow sense of a ratio decidendi—requiring identification of the
essential reasoning common to the majority judges
at a low level of
generality—there was no ratio decidendi in
At least two
matters that were essential to the reasons of Steward J were rejected by
the plurality. But in the broader sense, at
a higher level of generality, the
ratio decidendi of

Constitution
because it is not productive of practical injustice.

are two broad dimensions of consideration when asking whether the reasoning or
result of a case should be re-opened in order
to determine whether it should be
overruled. At the stage of re-opening, those dimensions must be more easily
satisfied than when
considering whether to overrule the reasoning or result. The

overruling the reasoning or
the decision in
had rested only upon the reasons of the plurality,
then there would have been great force to the application to re-open that
grave difficulties with reasoning that treats any court procedure as beneficial,
no matter how the litigants are required
to be treated by the court, merely
because it confers some advantages over other procedures. But the ratio
decidendi of
does not lie in this reasoning of the plurality. It
lies in the much broader proposition that
in its particular context, consistent with Ch III of the
Constitution
because it is not productive of practical injustice.
Legislation
will not be inconsistent with the requirements of Ch III of the
Constitution
merely because it obliges a court to act unjustly.
Invalidity will arise only in the extreme category where the legislation is not
reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for a legitimate purpose. In
making such assessments, reasonable minds can differ.
Indeed, on this issue, my
conclusion changed between drafts of my reasons in
. If, as a matter
of interpretation, I had reached the same conclusion as Steward J in
relation to either of the first two aspects
of the scheme discussed above, then
I would have concluded that
was valid because it was not productive
of sufficient practical injustice when compared with alternatives. In other
words, it involved
pursuit of a legitimate purpose by means that were reasonably
capable of being seen as necessary.
fundamentally, however, my reasoning in
was not informed by the
possibility that

reads that provision as requiring the tender of certified documents. No
submission to that effect had been made in

effect was made in this special case.
these reasons, not only do I consider it strongly arguable that, contrary to my
reasons in that case, the result of

that the result can be justified by the application of principles of

of different labels, have been adopted in

In that sense,
the decision can be seen to be justified by a principle that has been worked out
in a succession of cases.
Apart from one significant issue, addressed below, these matters involving
justification weigh heavily against re-opening the result
Commonwealth pointed to a number of consequential matters that were said to
weigh against re-opening the result in
. One of those matters was the
reliance by the Commonwealth Parliament upon the decision in
re-enacting

factor has no real weight in circumstances in which this litigation challenging
had been brought before the new legislation was introduced into
Parliament. Another matter, which was also the concern of the Attorneys-General
for the States of Queensland and Western Australia, intervening, was the
reliance by the plurality and by State Parliaments upon
the decisions in
Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commissioner of
Condon v Pompano Pty
But neither of
those decisions required the conclusion that
was valid and neither
decision established a clear test of validity for provisions closer to the
border of invalidity such as
one significant issue that weighs heavily in favour of re‑opening is the
lack of any ratio decidendi in
at lower levels of generality. If the
same issue were litigated in the Federal Court of Australia, a Federal Court
judge would have
no binding reasoning to follow concerning a procedure that
would minimise injustice. Are certified documents required to be tendered
order to be considered by a court? The plurality reasons held that tender is not
required because
meant that the documents are already "before the
Federal Court".
Steward J's reasons held that their tender is required. Could a special
advocate be appointed by the Court? The plurality reasons
held that one could
not. Steward J's reasons held that one could. Is gisting generally
available? The plurality doubt that it is
but Steward J implicitly
recognises the ingenuity of creative lawyers.
Ultimately,
there is much to be said for re-opening
to re-explain a result that
has no ratio decidendi in a narrow sense, even if the result of the decision
would just be reaffirmed.
History reveals the danger of the opposite approach

the other hand, there is a strong likelihood that any re‑opening of
for this Court to re-explain the result on a cogent basis could fail
to achieve that objective and leave lower courts in a state
of even greater
uncertainty. The large variety of ways in which both the plaintiff and the
Commonwealth conceived of a valid operation
within the scheme in
which it existed, and the numerous permutations explored by the different
members of this Court over two hearings
of this special case, present a real
possibility that the reasoning of this Court would splinter even further than it
