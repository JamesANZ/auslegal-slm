disagreement came before the Court after the parties requested a review of the
matter. That review occurred on 2 July 2025.
application has been filed about Dr Pelz. The active objectors handed up a
draft Order setting out the relief they seek.
That draft Order
By 4.00pm [Thursday, 31 July 2025], the ACF Parties must
file in the Land Court Registry and serve on the Applicant and the Statutory
Party the statement of evidence of Dr Setu Pelz in reply to Annexure 4 to the
Coal and Energy Markets Joint Expert report titled
[8] The issue
arises late. The hearing is listed to begin on 21 July
[9] This is not
the first time that the Court has been asked to resolve a disagreement about how
Dr Pelz’s evidence should be
[10] The parties
have exchanged correspondence about Dr Pelz since July 2024. There is a complex
history about the role that his
evidence ought to play in the proceeding.
[11] The dispute
in correspondence back and forth culminated in an argument before the Court on 5
March 2025. Following on from that
argument, on 18 March 2025, it was Ordered
(a) by 4 April 2025, the active objectors file and serve a statement of evidence
of Dr Pelz;
(b) the Market Experts and Dr Pelz were to participate in a meeting of experts,
with Dr Pelz only involved to the extent of issues
relating to climate
(c) that joint meeting should produce a report authored by the Market experts
and also Dr Pelz (to the extent he had participated
[12] Dr Pelz
prepared an individual report on time and attended the joint expert meeting
[13] That joint
expert meeting process started in the week beginning 7 April 2025. It concluded
on 13 May 2025.
Gresswell included as part of the joint expert report, an individual report that
he had prepared. It became Annexure 4 to
that joint report. It is dated 30
April 2025.
[15] The active
objectors seek an opportunity for Dr Pelz to respond to Mr Gresswell’s
Annexure 4 document.
[16] The active
objectors submit that they ought to be able to put their best case forward.
They say that that involves Dr Pelz having
an opportunity to respond to Annexure
4. They say that the individual report of Dr Pelz may include a figure of the
kind that appears
at [930] of
Waratah Coal Pty Ltd v Youth Verdict Ltd &
. They say that the
individual report that they contemplate coming from Dr Pelz will be confined
and, based on the way that he expressed
himself in his individual report dated 4
April 2025, it can be expected that Dr Pelz will express himself in a concise
[17] Whitehaven
forcefully submit that to make the order sought by the active objectors would
“cause chaos” in two ways:
(a) it would give rise to the real risk that Dr Pelz produces evidence that
becomes a second expert opinion called by the active
objectors within the one
area of expertise. That is, Whitehaven says that the active objectors already
rely on the evidence of Dr
Wilson in the field of coal and energy markets and
that an individual report from Dr Pelz would effectively offer a second expert
opinion within that field; and
(b) it would give rise to the real risk Dr Pelz would “second guess”
the outcome of the coal and energy markets joint
expert report. Mr Gresswell
may then have to add a further response. Mr Gresswell may not have time to
properly respond to Dr Pelz’s
individual report. That is particularly so
given that 31 July 2025 – the date that the active objectors propose the
be delivered – will be after the hearing has started.
[18] Whitehaven
rely on an affidavit from Mr
that exhibits
correspondence about this issue. On 16 June 2025, Whitehaven’s solicitor
to the representative of the
active objectors and pointed out that the Court had cautioned against individual
reports commenting
on joint expert reports. That is particularly undesirable
after such a careful case management process has been utilised to have
expert reports prepared in a proper sequence and on time.
[19] Whitehaven
submits that it would be procedurally unfair to it, for the Court to make the
Order sought by the active objectors.
[20] The active
objectors submit that it would be procedurally unfair to them, for the Court to
shut them out from leading evidence
that would advance their case.
parties agree on the applicable principles.
[22] The High
Court has identified that any jurisdiction conferred on the Land Court is
necessarily conditioned by the requirement
to observe procedural fairness in the
exercise of that jurisdiction:
Oakey Coal Action Alliance v New Acland Coal
[23] As to the
obligation to afford procedural fairness, the parties direct attention to the
decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal
The Court said, at
[48], that:
... it is an essential requirement of a fair hearing
that each party by given a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case whether
in writing or orally or both. This will ordinarily include being informed of
the case to be advanced by the opposing party and having
an opportunity to
[24] At [49],
that Court identified that what is reasonable for this purpose will depend on
the circumstances of the case. The Court
identified matters to be considered in
determining the practical content of fairness in the particular case. The
statutory framework
was also identified as being a key consideration.
[25] Finally,
the parties draw attention to the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in
Sanrus Pty Ltd v Monto Coal 2 Pty
There, the reasons of
McMurdo JA at [29]-[31] set out what the trial judge had said were the relevant
considerations.
[26] Within that
summary is reference to the Court of Appeal decision in
Allianz Australia
Insurance Ltd v Mashaghati
Allianz Australia
, the then President of the Court of Appeal said that
Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National
stands for the
proposition:
that a just resolution of proceedings remains the
paramount objective and that while speed and efficiency, in the sense of minimum
delay and expense, are essential to a just resolution, these factors must not
detract from a proper opportunity being given to the
parties to put their
[28] Applying
the principles from those cases, the active objectors should have the order they
seek. That will keep open the proper
opportunity for them to put their case.
[29] The two
potential matters of chaos identified by Whitehaven can be managed to alleviate
or avoid unfairness to Whitehaven.
[30] As to the
first of the two chaos matters, if the Pelz individual report arrives and it is,
in truth, a second expert opinion
within a single field of expertise –
then if objection is taken to the Dr Pelz report on that basis, those aspects of
susceptible to being excluded. An objection of that kind is a matter
that can be dealt with expeditiously even after the hearing
has started.
[31] As to the
second of the two chaos matters, if the Pelz individual report arrives and Mr
Gresswell reviews it and says he cannot
respond to it in time – Whitehaven
should draw that to the Court’s attention immediately. Whitehaven may
choose at that
point to seek to have the Pelz individual report excluded.
[32] The Court
has not been given an updated version of the hearing plan. It is unclear how
long after 31 July Mr Greswell will give
his evidence. It may be possible for
the parties to schedule Mr Gresswell late within the listed hearing dates, to
give him the
longest possible window of opportunity to consider Dr Pelz’s
individual report.
understand that in the middle of a trial, it is difficult for legal
representatives and experts to act at short notice to respond
to new evidence.
They will, at that point, already have set tasks that will fully occupy their
time. It is not the Court’s
expectation that Mr Gresswell ought to have
to drop everything and respond at very short notice to this new individual
potential matters of unfairness can be managed once the Pelz report is
available. Dealing with those matters then is preferable
to shutting out the
active objectors from advancing their evidence now. That is particularly so
when the length and breadth of the
Pelz report is unknown.
[35] Whitehaven
submit that in the event the Court decides to make the proposed draft Order,
that Order ought to be accompanied by
an additional order requiring the written
instructions to Dr Pelz to be provided to the parties. Orders of that kind have
in this matter previously – see for example paragraph 6(b) of
the Order of 28 May 2025. It is appropriate that such additional
