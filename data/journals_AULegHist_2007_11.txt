A Jurisprudence of Power: Victorian Empire and the Rule of Law
A Jurisprudence of Power: Victorian Empire and the
Rule of Law
R W KOSTAL, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2005:
XIII AND 519 PAGES, PLUS INDEX
The history of British imperialism contains a good number of incidents in
which the authorities used excessive force to counter challenges
to colonial
rule, be they mere political protests or armed uprisings. The gunning down of
more than a thousand demonstrators in the
Amritsar massacre of 1919, the martial
law excesses of Governor Lord Codrington of Ceylon in 1848 are but two examples
which stand
as testament to the willingness of men in positions of authority to
go well beyond what were even at the time seen as the acceptable
official repression. The response of the Jamaican government to the troubles at
Morant Bay in 1865 is one of the best known
examples of this phenomenon. It led
to an enormous outcry at the time, which in turn produced a Royal Commission
which excoriated
Governor Edward Eyre and some of his military commanders.
The trouble began at Morant Bay in October 1865, when a group of men and
women, led by Paul Bogle, attacked and burned the courthouse
in Morant Bay,
killing the principal magistrate and seventeen others, mostly whites. Bogle was
a black Baptist minister and the leader
of a movement demanding political and
land reform in a colony in which only a small minority of whites held political
power and in
which the vast majority of the population, though fully emancipated
since 1838, lived lives of great poverty.
The response of the Jamaican government and military (regular and militia)
was swift, almost immediately effective, and remarkably
retributive. Martial law
was declared for the Morant Bay area by Governor Eyre, and in the ensuing weeks
literally hundreds of black
Jamaicans were killed, many of them tortured first.
The supposed rebellion itself was wholly suppressed within a few days, but most
of the retaliatory violence - almost 450 killed, more than 600 viciously flogged
- occurred after this, continuing throughout the
30-day period of martial law.
Some were 'tried' by military tribunals before execution, most were simply
gunned down.
Among those who died on an improvised gallows was George William Gordon, a
mixed-race landowner and one of the few non-whites in the
Jamaican Assembly.
Like Bogle he was prominent in the movement for reform, and consequently much
disliked by the planter elite. But
he did not advocate violence, and had taken
no part in the Morant Bay incident. Indeed he had been at home in Kingston when
it happened,
at home when a warrant was issued for his arrest two days later,
and at home when he surrendered to the authorities shortly afterwards.
warrant was issued personally by the Governor and accused Gordon of high
treason. Remarkably, Eyre also ordered Gordon taken
from Kingston, then under
regular civilian law, to Morant Bay, to be tried by a military tribunal. He was
quickly tried, convicted,
and sentenced, without the benefit of legal
representation or any of the protective procedures of civilian criminal
procedure. Six
days after his arrest he was hanged from the still-standing arch
of the burned courthouse at Morant Bay.
The Morant Bay affair and its aftermath have been the subject of an extensive
literature, but none has looked deeply at the proceedings
from the standpoint of
legal history, which is what R.W. Kostal does in this very fine book -
meticulously researched, insightful,
and very clearly written. He shows both
that the affair was understood by many in England in legal terms and raised
profound legal
issues, and that the way that legal debate was conducted was
infused by political considerations. In short, law mattered, but it
was far from
autonomous. Kostal is chiefly concerned to make the former point, letting the
latter emerge at times by implication.
Marshalling copious evidence he argues
successfully that the way the Morant Bay affair was debated shows a profound
penetration into
the language used by what he terms the 'political class' of the
1860s of concepts of law and legality. In particular the affair forced
consideration of that most oxymoronic of terms, 'martial law.' The limits of raw
power under martial law were not resolved
by this consideration, but the debate
was a spirited and at times divisive one which brought the contradictions of
governing in supposed
'emergencies' to the fore. He similarly shows that empire,
especially the non-white empire, posed considerable challenges to the
peoples' conceptions of themselves as a moral nation (a concern that can be
traced back to Burke and his campaign to impeach
Warren Hastings). The empire
was supposed to be a moral force for improvement and civilisation, yet Morant
Bay exposed the fact that
an immoral lust to retain power too often was the
hallmark of imperial administration on the ground.
In demonstrating these points Kostal takes us carefully and comprehensively,
if at times just a little laboriously, through the numerous
proceedings, legal
and otherwise, that formed the aftermath of the rebellion and its suppression.
An extensive investigation took
place in Jamaica, carried out by a Royal
Commission of which two of the three members were senior London lawyers. It
concluded that
while Eyre had been correct in seeing the situation as serious,
as a potential rebellion more than a mere riot, and was therefore
justified in
declaring martial law, the operation of that law left much wanting. Some
officers had inflicted 'barbarous' punishments
(p. 121), courts martial had
failed dismally to adhere to any standards of due process, and Eyre had kept
martial law in place for
much too long. While the government accepted the
report's principal conclusions, it did not try to prosecute anybody criticised
the Royal Commission. That job was left to the so-called Jamaica Committee, a
private group of powerful men concerned with the rights
of the empire's
non-white citizens and critical from the beginning of Eyre's actions. The
Committee launched private prosecutions
against Eyre and two military officers
for their role in the death of Gordon. The first foundered when Shropshire
magistrates at
the preliminary inquiry refused to send the case on for trial,
and failed again twice more when different charges wee preferred.
officers were sent to trial in London, but a grand jury found the indictment not
a true bill. Civil litigation also proved
In the end, Kostal's account reveals, for all the grandeur of the law and for
all the legalisation of the response to the Morant Bay
affair, it was politics,
the politics of imperial security in the non-white empire, that prevailed. Many
Englishmen believed that
'their countrymen had betrayed the minimum demands of
civilized conduct,' and that the suppression of the Morant Bay disturbance
'a matter of intense shame' for them (pp. 460-461). Yet at the end of the day
the twin beliefs that Britain was destined to rule
over many parts of the
non-white world and that that rule could be sustained only by brute force when
challenged, prevailed. It is
not the result that matters, however, as much as
the extraordinarily spirited demand for law and legality that Morant Bay
precipitated.
And in this regard Kostal succeeds admirably in demonstrating his
central thesis that the debate over Morant Bay was an essentially
Unfortunately the book's production qualities are not of the same standard as
its scholarly ones. It is littered with errors, the
kind that should have been
picked up by copy-editors and proofreaders. There are numerous typographical
mistakes, as well as words
missing from sentences and/or extra words inserted. A
typical example of poor proof-reading is the following sentence from p. 79:
'Having established a working relationship with the lawyers from the Jamaica
Committee lawyers Storks tackled another thorny problem'.
Obviously the word
lawyers needs to be used only once, and presumably it was phrased one way and
then the other. But the final version
needs to get it right - one or the other,
not both. This kind of problem appears throughout, many times over. There was a
the Oxford UP name meant that this did not happen; this most venerable
of university presses needs to improve its standards in this
regard if it is to
be considered among the first rank of academic publishers. A disservice has been
done to a book that is certainly
in the first rank of legal historical
scholarship.
