APPEARANCES
For the Applicant
Peter O’Farrell and Emma Peppler of Counsel
Instructed by Sebastian Withers, lawyer of Norton Rose Fulbright
For the Decision Maker
Tomo Boston and Suganya Pathan of Counsel
Instructed by Phili Stefanovski and Liam Halverson, lawyers of Minter
20 October 2025, the Applicant:
that the Tribunal make a direction pursuant to
section 108(1)(b)
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998
(Vic) (‘VCAT
Act’), giving notice to the parties that the Tribunal seeks reconstitution
of the Tribunal for the purposes
of the proceeding. The request was to add a
legal member to the Tribunal as currently constituted; and
alternatively,
if the Tribunal was not minded to give notice under s 108(1)(b) of the VCAT Act,
seeks reconstitution of the Tribunal
for the purposes of the proceeding, to add
a legal member to the Tribunal as presently comprised, pursuant to section
108(1)(a) of
the VCAT Act.
Decision Maker indicated that it did not oppose:
Tribunal giving notice under s 108(1)(b) of the VCAT Act; or
Applicant’s alternative application for reconstitution under s 108(1)(a)
of the VCAT Act.
Joint Submission of the Parties Regarding Reconstitution of the Tribunal dated
22 October 2025 was provided to the Tribunal by the

have considered that the Tribunal’s Order of 24 October 2025 which
includes a detailed summary of what transpired leading
up to and at the hearing
which commenced on 13 October 2025.
Tribunal’s reasons for giving notice under s 108(1)(b) of the VCAT Act are
summarised in paragraph [56] of its reasons as
[56] The Tribunal gives this notice because:
we accept the
submissions made by the parties in the Joint Submissions Regarding
Reconstitution and agree that the appropriate course
is to reconstitute the
it is clear to
the Tribunal that there may be questions of mixed fact and law that need to be
properly formulated, and that need to
be determined;
the EPA has
formulated questions of mixed fact and law that they say need to be
determined;
the Applicant
does not yet consider that the questions are necessarily appropriately
formulated and seeks for them to be formulated
before, and determined by, a
legal member;
the Applicant
does not agree to the currently constituted Tribunal deciding the questions of
mixed fact and law under clause 66(1)(a)
of Schedule 1 of the VCAT Act;
the questions
identified by the EPA are not questions readily capable of referral under clause
66(1)(b) of Schedule 1 of the VCAT
Act because the issues raised may influence
much of the evidence and factual analysis. In this case, deciding the issues in
or as preliminary issues, may risk the need to revisit similar issues
later in the proceeding leading to ambiguity and inefficiency;
in an attempt to
avoid having to resolve the potential questions of law in this proceeding, the
parties have endeavoured to navigate
the differences in terminology used by each
party in this proceeding, however that has not proven to be an efficient
process. Given
the multiple preliminary issues that have arisen in this
proceeding so far, and the high likelihood of ongoing legal or procedural
disputes, it would be more efficient for the Tribunal to include a legal member
so that any potential questions can to be determined
without needing to consider
whether they are questions of law and whether there is any disagreement from the
parties as to whether
the currently constituted Tribunal can decide the question
of law under clause 66(1)(a) of Schedule 1 of the VCAT Act; and
the EPA does not
oppose the Applicant’s request for the Tribunal to give notice of
reconstitution.
matter was listed for an Administrative Mention on 29 October 2025 to provide
the parties with the opportunity to:
any further submissions to the Presidential member comprised to consider whether
the Tribunal should be reconstituted under section
108(2)(a) of the VCAT Act;
any further submissions to the Presidential member with respect to section
108(3) of the VCAT Act and whether this is a matter
before the Presidential
29 October 2025, the Applicant provided a submission in accordance with Order 2
of the Tribunal’s Orders dated 24 October
2025 stating:
a) The Applicant does not wish to make any further submissions to the
presidential member regarding the decision whether the Tribunal
reconstituted under
s 108(2)(a)
Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal Act 1998
(Vic.) (VCAT Act). The Applicant is content to rely upon the
joint submission regarding reconstitution filed by the parties on 22
2025, and the Tribunal’s Orders, which set out a clear and compelling
basis for reconstitution.
b) In relation to s 108(3) of the VCAT Act, the Applicant submits that this
sub-section is a permissive provision, use of which will
be a matter for the
reconstituted Tribunal to determine, after hearing submissions from the parties.
It is not a provision that the
presidential member considering the request for
reconstitution needs to make any determination in relation to.
Although this is a matter for the future reconstituted Tribunal, it is
convenient for the Applicant to note that on further consideration
with the reflections of the Tribunal in the Orders at paragraphs
29 October 2025, the Decision Maker advised the Tribunal in response to Order 2
of the Tribunal’s Orders dated 24 October
2025, it does not wish to make
any further submissions to the Presidential member.

reconstituted after allowing the parties to make
submissions.

should be reconstituted and the Tribunal’s

reasons how it explored with the parties whether there are alternatives to a
reconstitution and concluded

of Schedule 1 of the VCAT
parties agree that referral under clause 66(1)(b) of Schedule 1 of the VCAT Act
is not convenient or appropriate given the nature
of the issues in dispute in
this proceeding;
will be efficient to include a legal member constituted to conduct the hearing
given the issues which have emerged during the hearing
to date and the high
likelihood of ongoing legal or procedural matters arising; and
in the interests of justice to do so.
I consider that the reconstitution of the Tribunal is appropriate even if the
newly constituted Tribunal considers that there
is no utility in the legal
member listening to the recording of the hearing conducted to date, and that it
may be more efficient
to restart the hearing before the reconstituted Tribunal.
This will be a matter for consideration at a future practice day hearing

hearing, including about the future conduct of the proceeding.
Carol Daicic
Deputy President
In its reasons of 24 October
2025, the Tribunal as presently comprised indicated at paragraphs [66] –
[69] that listening
to the recording of the hearing to date may not be of
assistance to the new Tribunal member of the reconstituted Tribunal and that
may be more efficient to restart the hearing before the reconstituted Tribunal.
