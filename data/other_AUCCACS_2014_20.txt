September 2013 and expiring on 6 March 2021 (79%
of head sentence) [35].
Original Offence
The offence of assault occurred when the offender knocked on the victim's
door and then walked away, talking about black people taking
his country. While
the offender was walking away, the victim went to his car. The offender
approached him, swearing and accusing
him of taking his country. The victim
tried to get away and was pulled backwards by the offender. The offender then
punched the victim
in the mouth. The victim then fell down and was punched
several times [7.4].
The offence of sexual intercourse with a young person was committed when the
offender was on bail in relation to the offence of assault.
On the day of the
incident, the victim was at the Belconnen Library with her mother. The offender
entered the library to use the
toilet. In the library, the offender began
looking at books and was approached by the victim. The offender encouraged the
to sit with him. The offender then partially pulled down his pants and
underwear. He then pulled down the victim's underwear and
pants and inserted his
finger into the victim's vagina, removed it and then re-inserted it while
thrusting his groin against the
victim's buttock [7.8].
Offender’s circumstances
The offender's personal circumstances were considered at trial [7.16]. The
offender came from a highly disadvantaged background. As
a child, he was subject
to physical violence by his alcoholic father [7.16] and his mother left when the
offender was about 10 years
of age [7.16]. The offender and his brother were
neglected and effectively raised by an extended family who, when intoxicated,
him to sexual abuse including abuse of the most heinous type [7.16].
The offender's schooling was highly disrupted and he moved between a number
of locations and schools in Queensland and New South Wales
and was typically
placed in special classes [7.17]. He left school at 17 years of age. He has a
poor employment history, which was
likely contributed to by his poor schooling
and the time he has spent in custody [7.17].
The offender has abused alcohol since he was 12 years of age [7.18] and
cannabis since he was 10 years of age [7.18]. The offender
has also suffered two
possibly significant physical traumas [7.19]. At four years of age, he sustained
a serious injury from a fall
that may have affected his behaviour. At six years
of age, he fell and suffered a head injury and may have experienced brain damage

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and / or indicators of disadvantage
Murrell CJ observed that the offender presented as an Indigenous person who
had suffered an extremely deprived upbringing as a result
of which he lacked the
psychological resources to conduct himself in the manner in which a normal adult
would conduct himself. On
the other hand, it was noted that he is someone who
has demonstrated that he is a danger to the community. He is a danger to the
most vulnerable members of the community; young people under the age of 10, and
children as young as the three-year-old victim in
these proceedings [7.21].
No further comments about Aboriginality were made.
Relevant passage(s):
'The offender's personal circumstances must be considered. He is now 40 years
of age. He comes from a highly disadvantaged background,
one that is typical of
many Indigenous offenders' [quoting Murrell CJ at [16]].
'The offender presents as an Indigenous person who has suffered an extremely
deprived upbringing as a result of which he lacks the
psychological resources to
conduct himself in the manner in which a normal adult would conduct himself. On
the other hand, he is
someone who has demonstrated that he is a danger to the
community. He is a danger to the most vulnerable members of the community;
people under the age of 10, and children as young as the three-year-old victim
in these proceedings' [quoting Murrell CJ at
'The factors we have identified in relation to the respondent's offending,
even set against the respondent's undeniably dysfunctional
background (including
in particular his own experience of childhood sexual abuse), and the
respondent's lack of violent offences
in his criminal history, have led us to
conclude that the sentences under appear were manifestly inadequate' [32].
Grounds of Appeal:
The sentence imposed on the offender was manifestly inadequate [4].
Appeal Outcome:
Appeal allowed.
The Court held that there were a number of matters pointing to manifest
inadequacy including:
(a) that the offender was on bail for the assault offence at the time of the
sexual intercourse offence, and was on his way to report
to police in
performance of his obligations under his registration as a Child Sex
(b) the gravity of the sexual intercourse offence, including by reference to
the age of the child, the nature of the sexual intercourse,
which involved
actual penetration, and the shamelessness of the offending behaviour;
(c) the offender's prior record for offences of a similar kind against other
young children and the fact that he appeared to have
re-offended on each
occasion shortly after being released from the previous prison term;
(d) the fact of re-offending despite both having served prison time for
earlier similar offences and having been provided with treatment
for his sexual
(e) the offender's bleak prospects of rehabilitation; and
(f) the importance of the sentencing purpose of community protection, having
regard to the repetition of the offending behaviour.
The Court acknowledged that while the offender had an 'undeniably
dysfunctional background' and 'lack of violent offences in his criminal
history', the factors identified by the Court led them to conclude that the
sentences under appeal were manifestly inadequate. The
Court held that they were
manifestly inadequate not just as a result of the 25% early plea of guilty, but
even before those deductions
were applied by the trial judge [32].
The Court allowed the appeal, set aside the original sentence and
re-sentenced the offender to:
(a) assault: three years' imprisonment, reduced from four years for his plea
of guilty (as opposed to two years and three months'
imprisonment, reduced from
three years); and
(b) sexual intercourse: eight years' imprisonment, reduced from ten years for
his plea of guilty (as opposed to six years' imprisonment,
reduced from eight
The sexual intercourse sentence started eighteen months after the assault
sentence, backdated to 7 September 2013 and expiring on
6 March 2023.
The Court fixed a non-parole period of seven and a half years, backdated to
7 September 2013 and expiring on 6 March 2021 (79% of
head sentence). The
Court acknowledged that this was a relatively high non-parole period in the ACT,
but this was necessary for community
protection in this case.
