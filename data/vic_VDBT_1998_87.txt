REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
1. This is an application to review a determination of the Tribunal under
s108 of the Domestic Building Contracts and Tribunal Act
1995 ("the Act"). The
sections permits the Tribunal to review any such determination if two conditions
are satisfied -
"(a) evidence that was not available at the time the Tribunal made its
determination becomes available; and
(b) the evidence is of such a material nature that it is likely that it would
have caused the Tribunal to have come to a different
determination had it been
available at the initial proceeding."
2. The grounds of the application are set out in the application as follows -
"1. To reopen and reconsider the decision of Dr Cremean given 27 November
2. The decision was obtained without material evidence being made available
to the Tribunal by Mrs Reid.
3. The Respondent has not suffered any loss and damage."
That application is supported by an Affidavit sworn by Anton Engelmayer a
director of the Applicant company. The Application is made
well out of time and
leave needs to be given under s99 of the Act to extend time in order that the
matter may be dealt with. Section108(3)
requires an application to be filed not
later than 60 days after the determination. Accordingly this application is
approximately
60 days out of time. Having regard to the conclusion I have
reached in relation to this Application I propose to extend time for
lodging the
Application for Review until 5.00 pm, 30 March 1998.
3. The Affidavit in support of the application alleges that there has been a
non disclosure of material evidence relevant to the ultimate
determination of
the Tribunal. Para 7 of the Affidavit is in the following terms -
"Sometime after the determination of the Tribunal my solicitor became aware
of the sale (The sale of the home the subject of these
proceedings) and had
moved to a new home. I also believe that the owners did not rectify the defects
in the property. I believe the
owners never intended to rectify the defects,
either at the date of the hearing or subsequent to obtaining the determination
Tribunal dated 26 November 1997."
The Affidavit goes on to contend that the owners have not suffered any loss
or damage as a consequence of the defective work.
I have considerable doubt as to whether or not an Affidavit in this form
complies with the requirements of the section. Sub-section
2 requires the
application to be accompanied by "a copy of the new evidence, or if that is not
possible, by a detailed description
of the new evidence". In my opinion the
Affidavit falls well short of that requirement. However the application suffers
from a much
more serious defect. The evidence must be of such a material nature
that it is likely it would have caused the Tribunal to have come
to a different
determination. In my opinion whether that evidence had been available or not at
the time of the hearing it could not
have had a material effect on the
determination. The law in this area is well settled. The High Court in the
leading decision of
Bellgrove v Eldridge
[1954] HCA 36
(1954) 90 CLR 613
stated the position
in the following terms -
"It was suggested that during the course of argument that if the Respondent
retains her present judgment and it is satisfied, she
may or may not demolish
the existing house and re-erect another. If she does not, it is said she will
still have a house together
with the cost of erecting another one. To our mind
this circumstance is quite immaterial and is but one variation of a feature
so often presents itself in the assessment of damages in cases where they
must be assessed once and for all."
That case is referred to in Brooking on Building Contracts Third Edition by
Damien J. Cremean at page 146 in the following terms -
"The fact that the building owner has managed to sell the building at a
profit will not displace the ordinary rule concerning the
measure of damages.
That rule, is laid down in Belgrove v Eldridge applies whether or not the
proprietor has sold the building."
In Director of War Service Homes v Harris (1968) Qd.R.275 Mr Justice Gibbs as
he then was said at page 278 -
"It is true that Belgrove v Eldridge was not a case in which the building
owner had sold the building before bringing that action
but I unable to see any
reason why there should be a different measure of damages in such a case and
nothing is said in Belgrove
v Eldridge to support any such distinction."
A similar view was taken by the House of Lords in the recent decision of
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth
(1995) 3ALL ER 268.
in my opinion from the application of the above principles that whether or not
the owners had formed an intention to sell
the property at or prior to the
hearing of their claim or had decided not to rectify the defective work is not
relevant to the assessment
of damages. Accordingly as a matter of law the new
evidence is not of such a material nature it is likely that it would have caused
the Tribunal to come to a different determination had it
been available at the time. In these circumstances the Tribunal has no power
to conduct a s108 review. The Application to Review must
fail and accordingly I
order that the application is dismissed.
