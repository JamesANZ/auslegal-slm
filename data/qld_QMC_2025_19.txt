SOLICITORS:
Senior Constable R Higham for the Complainant
Nightingale Law for the Defendant
What offence is the Defendant charged with?
[1] The Defendant is charged with one count of Drive motor vehicle without
driver licence disqualified by Court Order:
A person must not
motor vehicle
unless the person holds a
driver licence
authorising the
person to drive the vehicle on the
If the person committed the offence while
disqualified by any Court
, the maximum penalty is 60 penalty units or 18 months
imprisonment.
(Underlining added)
[2] The Defendant did not dispute the elements of the offence. The uncontested
evidence from the Prosecution was on 25 February 24,
the Defendant was driving a
black Holden Commodore on a road near Widgee. Exhibit
is unchallenged evidence proving she did
this while disqualified by a Court Order.
Does the Defendant have a Defence of Extraordinary Emergency?
Defence raised the defence of ‘Extraordinary Emergency’.
[4] This defence is that a person is not criminally responsible for an act
or omission done or made under such circumstances of sudden
or extraordinary
emergency, that an ordinary person possessing ordinary power of self-control,
could not reasonably be expected to
[5] Where a Defendant raises
this defence, it is not for the Defendant to prove that she acted as she did
because of the stress of
an extraordinary emergency. It is for the prosecution
to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that she did
Has the Prosecution satisfied me that the
circumstances that confronted the Defendant did not amount to an extraordinary
[6] The defence of ‘extraordinary emergency’ raises
two issues:
(a) Whether there is an extraordinary emergency; and
(b) If so, whether an
ordinary person possessing ordinary power of self-control could not reasonably
be expected to act other than
the Defendant
[7] I must therefore direct myself to be in the Defendant’s position at
the time and not use hindsight reason to determine
the best course available to
the Defendant. I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the
Defendant’s reaction in the
circumstances was outside what I could
reasonably expect of an ordinary person with ordinary powers of
self-control.
Was there an extraordinary
[8] ‘Emergency’ requires immediate action,
commensurate with the consideration of self-control – a person must be
reacting to imminent danger.
An emergency can
include likely danger to life or
[9] The Defendant’s
unrefuted evidence was at the time she decided to drive, she was scared because
her then-partner threatened
to kill her dog. Her version is consistent with the
police bodycam footage showing her dog was with her in the car when
intercepted.
I accept this is the reason
the Defendant made the decision to drive.
[10] The Defendant has since had a
Protection Order naming her as the Aggrieved and her former partner as the
Respondent. That Order
can only be made with the consent of her then-partner or
after findings of domestic violence have been made. In either case, the
of the Protection Order naming the Defendant as an Aggrieved establishes her as
a vulnerable person.
[11] A threat to kill an aggrieved’s animal is a
well-recognised act of coercive control going beyond a mere threat to property.
As a matter of law, I am therefore satisfied the threat to kill the
Defendant’s dog can constitute an emergency.
[12] I make a finding of
fact the threat to kill the Defendant’s dog was an extraordinary
emergency. This is in circumstances
(a) the dog was her companion;
(b) close proximity in time and space between
her then-partner and her dog; and
(c) her unrefuted evidence of it being the latest incident in an ongoing pattern
of domestic violence by the her then-partner including
being physically violent
towards the Defendant, locking her out of the house, breaking things, damaging
her property, falsely accusing
her of what he believed to be inappropriate
behaviour, and trying to make her feel bad about furthering herself.
[13] I am satisfied the Defendant’s decision to drive was a reaction to
imminent danger from her then-partner – namely
the threat to kill her dog.
Assessing the Defendant’s act of driving with her dog within holistic
principles of domestic violence,
satisfied she reacted to an objectively based fear of imminent danger from her
then-partner to her dog and ultimately, to herself.
Would an ordinary person
with ordinary powers of self-control have acted as the Defendant?
such circumstances of extraordinary emergency, it was reasonable to expect that
an ordinary person with ordinary powers
of self-control could have acted as the
Defendant did, the Defence will not have been
[15] The test is whether an
ordinary person possessing ordinary powers of self-control could not reasonably
be expected to act other
than as the Defendant.
[16] The Prosecution
submitted the Defendant’s demeanour when intercepted by police was not
consistent with escaping danger
and she had other reasonable courses of action
available including:
(a) Using her phone to call for help;
(b) Driving to the closest police
station or a nearby fertiliser factory; or
(c) Alerting the intercepting police when it passed her or once pulled over.
[17] Consistent with holistic principles for assessing domestic violence, I do
not accept the Defendant’s emotional state as
determinative of her
The Defendant is not expected
to be wiser or better than an ordinary person in the same
circumstances.
She must act quickly and do
the best she can. A person is not to be condemned simply on the basis that in
the agony of the moment
and without the opportunity to weigh up and deliberate
upon what action to take, she made a wrong
[18] The Defendant was a
vulnerable woman in an isolated rural area being confronted by a partner who was
threatening her animal companion.
This was not only a direct threat to the dog.
Because of the Defendant’s relationship to her dog, it was also a threat
own mental and emotional wellbeing.
[19] Using her phone to call for
[20] The closest neighbouring properties to the Defendant were occupied by
her then-partner’s landlord and his parents. Given
the commercial,
historical and familial connections the people occupying those properties had
with the Defendant’s then-partner,
I am not satisfied they were places of
sanctuary or refuge for the Defendant.
[21] The Defendant gave evidence she
did not alert police because she believed they had not previously taken her
concerns seriously.
Even if that belief was mistaken, I am satisfied it was
honest and reasonable
(a) Like many institutions who serve the public, the quality of the police
response will often depend on the skill, training and
insight of the
investigating officer; and
(b) The Defendant’s unrefuted evidence that
on an earlier occasion the police had taken six hours to attend upon her in
to a complaint she made against her then-partner.
[22] Police resources are limited and delay in response time can have many
reasons. But that does not detract from the reasonableness
Defendant’s belief because the consequence for her is the same – her
concern not being readily addressed by police.
[23] It is well-recognised -
albeit belatedly - that victims may not immediately report domestic violence,
whether it be due to concerns
reasonable doubt for the Defendant. This then makes it reasonable for her to
consider other options to remove herself from imminent
danger to a place of
[24] I do not consider visiting upon a fertiliser factory - or any
place where the Defendant had no prior connection - to be a viable
alternative
option. Places and people unfamiliar to anyone, let alone a woman in fear of
domestic violence, carry their own risk.
It may have well been a case of
“out of the pan, into the fire”.
[25] The Defendant’s
unrefuted evidence was she was driving to her girlfriend who lived nearby. She
said she wanted to go where
she felt safe. Because of gender issues surrounding
domestic violence and the Defendant’s established relationship with her
female friend, I am satisfied that her friend’s home was the closest place
she could go where she was most likely to be given
shelter and understanding. It
was her ‘safe harbour’ in the tumult.
[26] The Defendant was an
isolated and vulnerable woman seeking refuge from an imminent threat of domestic
violence. She removed herself
from that extraordinary emergency by removing
herself and her valued companion from the source of that threat by driving to
the nearest
place of refuge. It is reasonable to expect an ordinary person in
that situation to have acted in that way.
What Orders are
appropriate?
[27] Because the Prosecution has not discharged its burden to
prove that the circumstances confronting the Defendant did not amount
extraordinary emergency, the Defendant is not criminally responsible for the act
of driving while disqualified as alleged.
[28] The appropriate Orders
1. Charge is dismissed.
2. Enter a verdict of acquittal.
3. Defendant is discharged.
