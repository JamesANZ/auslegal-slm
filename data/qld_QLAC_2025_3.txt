[4] Balanced
purchased Seloh Nolem on 31 August 2015. Seloh Nolem adjoins
Vermont Park and is on the opposite side of the
Isaac River, comprising another 8,614.948 hectares. Since the acquisition of
Nolem in 2015, the two properties have been operated in conjunction as
breeding properties. The combined area of Vermont Park and
Seloh Nolem is
25,283.958 hectares. In the five years from 2018 to 2022 cattle numbers have
varied between 4725 (in 2018) to 5527
(in 2020) with an average holding of 5081
cattle per annum.

) provides that a mining
lease shall not be granted in a case such as the present one until compensation
has been agreed or as determined
by the Land Court.
[9] The parties
could not agree on an appropriate quantum of compensation payable to Namrog and
Balanced in the event the mining lease
is granted to Pembroke and so the Land
Court was asked to make that
determination.
experienced rural valuers gave expert evidence: Mr McLay, who was engaged by
Namrog and Balanced, and Mr Cavanagh, who was
engaged by Pembroke. Mr McLay and
Mr Cavanagh submitted a joint valuers’ report (
), gave evidence,
and were cross-examined simultaneously in the Land Court hearing.
[11] Mr McLay
reasoned that the compensation to the landowners as a result of the mining lease
over Vermont Park was properly assessed
at $45,249,579.00. Mr Cavanagh assessed
compensation to the owners as a result of the granting of the mining lease over
Vermont Park
at $22,207,356.00.
[12] The valuers
also disagreed as to the proper compensation payable in respect of Seloh Nolem,
with McLay opining compensation at
$15,690,551.00 and Mr Cavanagh assessing
compensation at $6,275,912.00.
[13] In view of
the disparity in the expert opinion evidence, the primary judge “wielded a
blunt axe where necessary”
in making the
determination.
Compensation was
assessed by the Land Court in the sum of $34,835,600.40 with Namrog as owner of
Vermont Park, being awarded $26,287,445.40
in compensation. The owner of Seloh
Nolem, Balanced was awarded $8,548,154.99 in compensation.
[14] Both the
landowners and the miner contend that the judgment contains errors of fact and
law and that the compensation assessment
made by the Land Court is incorrect:
the former argue it should be higher; the latter says it should be lower. The
landowners argue
that as the primary judge utilised the carrying capacity of
each property as a method of settling the compensation sum, which was
foreshadowed, and as both experts had considered carrying capacity to be an
unreliable metric, the judgment is flawed.
landowners Namrog and Balanced appealed to the Land Appeal Court, raising 22
grounds of appeal. The miner Pembroke cross-appealed,
raising eight grounds of
appeal. The landowners also sought leave to amend a ground of appeal, that there
was a denial of procedural
fairness in the way the compensation was assessed.
Leave to amend was opposed, however, it was granted as it was an argument of law
and not dependant on any evidential matters which could prejudice the
respondent.
[16] For the
reasons that follow, we find that the appeal should be allowed, and the
cross-appeal be dismissed.
Land Court Act 2000
(Qld) confirms that “an appeal in
the Land Appeal Court must be decided on the evidence on the record of the
proceeding in
which the decision appealed against was made”. The appeal is
by way of rehearing.
[18] Although
there is a statutory discretion to admit new evidence in
section 56(2)
Land Court Act 2000
of that Act
also confirms there is power to remit the question of compensation for
re-determination in the Land Court. We are satisfied
there is no need to do the
latter and find there is ample evidence available to settle the quantum of
compensation
Conflict in
valuation evidence
circumstance that experienced valuers can hold well-reasoned and genuine
opinions placing vastly different values upon the
same parcel of land is not a
recent development. In the leading valuation case:
Spencer v The Commonwealth
of Australia
(1907) 5 CLR 418 ten valuers were called, with valuations of
the subject land varying between £8,400 and £2,066. The primary
judge's selection of the lowest valuation was found to be erroneous by Griffiths
CJ, Barton and Isaacs JJ.
[20] Griffiths
CJ described what has become to be known as the
test at 432 as:
“‘What would a man desiring to buy the land have had to
pay for it on that day to a vendor willing to sell it for a fair
price but not
desirous to sell?’” [...] The necessary mental process is to put
yourself as far as possible in the position
of persons conversant with the
subject at the relevant time, and from that point of view to ascertain what,
according to the then
current opinion of land values, a purchaser would have had
to offer for the land to induce such a willing vendor to sell it, or,
words, to inquire at what point a desirous purchaser and a not unwilling vendor
would come together.”
[21] Barton J
described the test at 438 as:
“... a claimant is entitled to
have for his land what it is worth to a man of ordinary prudence and foresight,
not holding his
land for merely speculative purposes, nor, on the other hand,
anxious to sell for any compelling or private reason, but willing to
business man would be to another such person, both of them alike uninfluenced by
any consideration of sentiment or need.”
[22] Isaacs J
described the test at 440-441 as:
“...the fair price of the
land, which a hypothetical prudent purchaser would entertain, if he desired to
purchase it for the
most advantageous purpose for which it was adapted. The
plaintiff is to be compensated; therefore he is to receive the money equivalent
to the loss he has sustained by deprivation of his land, and that loss, apart
from special damage not here claimed, cannot exceed
what such a prudent
purchaser would be prepared to give him. To arrive at the value of the land at
that date, we have, as I conceive,
to suppose it sold then, not by means of a
forced sale, but by voluntary bargaining between the plaintiff and a purchaser,
to trade, but neither of them so anxious to do so that he would overlook
any ordinary business consideration. We must further suppose
perfectly acquainted with the land, and cognizant of all circumstances which
might affect its value, either advantageously
or prejudicially, including its
situation, character, quality, proximity to conveniences or inconveniences, its
surrounding features,
the then present demand for land, and the likelihood, as
then appearing to persons best capable of forming an opinion, of a rise
for what reason soever in the amount which one would otherwise be willing to fix
as the value of the property.”
valuers in the present case proceeded in an orthodox manner, that is, by
identifying several comparable sales and then bringing
their experience to bear
upon an adjustment to the comparable sales prices, expressed as dollars per
hectare, to arrive at their
property valuations.
[24] One such
comparable sale was the rural property Jimarndy, a large rural property of some
17,368.3 hectares, which settled in
September 2022 for $47,233,265.00. Both
valuers agreed that Jimarndy was the most comparable property to Vermont Park,
a similar land area and a comparable mix of scrub, forest and river
country. Further, both valuers had a similar analysis of the
value of Jimarndy
based on a September 2022 settlement, with Mr Cavanagh opining the correct rate
at $2,687.00 per hectare and Mr
McLay at $2,717.00 per hectare.
[25] Mr McLay's
approach to the valuation of Vermont Park was to utilise Jimarndy as the closest
comparative, assess it as being slightly
superior, and then decrease the dollar
rate per hectare slightly to account for five factors, including Jimarndy's
superior carrying
capacity. He noted that Jimarndy was prone to flooding,
whereas Vermont Park was not. Mr McLay was careful to state that the valuation
was not performed, importantly, on any strict mathematical basis.
Cavanagh's approach was to map out Vermont Park and to allocate it into three
distinct types of country, and then to value
each type of country at vastly
different rates per hectare.
[27] Either
method utilised by the valuers, if the analysis was accurately undertaken, was
an orthodox method of valuation.
[28] The primary
judge rejected Mr Cavanagh's approach by concluding that Mr Cavanagh had
abandoned the
when he assessed the value of the properties in the before case as:
“He valued each component of the properties in the after
case, and then added those amounts together to arrive at the before
Surely no hypothetical purchaser would assess a potential purchase price this
way. Rather, a hypothetical purchaser would
look at the type of country and the
carrying capacity to arrive at an overall value.”
respondent cross appealed this conclusion and this submission has merit. The
unchallenged evidence does not support the primary
judge's conclusion. The
unchallenged evidence is that both valuers adopted the direct comparison
approach as set out on page 25 of
their report. The method utilised by Mr
Cavanagh, set out on page 28 of the report, is that he used a five-step process.
[30] In step
one, Mr Cavanagh used Queensland Globe and Google Earth, showing the aerial
photo with cadastral boundaries and overlaid
that on the mining lease
application boundaries.
[31] In step
two, Mr Cavanagh said he measured the three main land categories and then
categorized them as remnant poor forest, remnant
better forest and non-remnant
cleared grazing.
[32] In step
three, Mr Cavanagh calculated the percentage of land with non-remnant cleared
grazing comprising brigalow and scrub influenced
land to provide a better
comparison between Vermont Park and comparable sales evidence.
[33] In step
four, Mr Cavanagh analysed the comparable sales evidence by deducting sale
inclusions and structural improvements to
derive a Treated, Fenced and Watered
[34] In step
five, Mr Cavanagh applied steps one to three to the sales evidence, apportioned
TFW values for each sale between the
differing land categories.
[35] Utilising
this method, Mr Cavanagh analysed Vermont Park's 16,669.01 hectares as
comprising 8,621.53 hectares of remnant poor
forest (51.72%), 2,747.37 hectares
of remnant better forest (16.48%) and 5,300.11 hectares of non-remnant cleared
grazing land (62%).
[36] Mr Cavanagh
then assessed a rate of $300.00 per hectare TFW for remnant poor forest,
$1,850.00 per hectare TFW for remnant better
forest, and then applied a variable
rate of between $3,000.00 per hectare TFW and $3,750.00 per hectare TFW for the
cleared grazing
[37] Mr Cavanagh
added the value of the structures assessed at $800,000.00 (3%) but then deducted
$100,000.00 to reflect the presence
of existing mining leases on the western
side of Vermont Park. Thus, Mr Cavanagh did not value each component of the
properties in
the after case and then add those amounts to arrive at the
[38] Mr Cavanagh
did analyse the purchase price by reference to the type of country comprising
Vermont Park and assessed it at a particular
value per hectare depending upon
his classification. Accordingly, it has been established that the primary judge
ought not to have
rejected Mr Cavanagh's opinion on the basis that the primary
methodology utilised by Mr Cavanagh to value Vermont Park at $26,604,940.00 was
an orthodox and logical methodology. It is
in the application of the methodology
in which error must be found in order to reject Mr Cavanagh's valuation.
valuers agreed that approximately 5,300 hectares of Vermont Park comprised the
cleared grazing land, which was the most
valuable land type. However, the
valuers significantly disagreed as to the correct valuation rate of that type of
land, with Mr McLay
valuing the productive land at $5,500.00 per hectare. As
stated above, Mr Cavanagh adopted rates of between $3,000.00 per hectare
$3,750.00 per hectare (with an average of $3,591.00 per
[41] The second
main area of difference between the valuers was the classification of and the
value rate of the remnant
with Mr Cavanagh
adopting $300.00 per hectare and Mr McLay adopting $1,200.00 per hectare. As
succinctly put at paragraph 177 of
“The main areas of
difference between us in relation to the value of the land is the way in which
we have measured and classified
different land types, and the application of
value rates to those areas.”
[42] Mr Cavanagh’s
before value of Vermont Park, at $27.4 million, was based on his tripartite
classification of the country
as calculated by him. Mr McLay utilised the same methodology as
Mr Cavanagh, but
he adopted different land classifications in respect of
river/creek frontages and remnant forest and applied significantly higher
[43] Mr McLay's
approach was to assess the cleared grazing land of 5,259.4 hectares at $5,500.00
per hectare for a total of $28,926,700.00.
River/creek frontages were then
valued at $2,500.00 per hectare to total $4,050,000.00 and remnant forest of
9,789.61 hectares was
valued at $1,200.00 per hectare, providing a value of
$11,747,532.00 for remnant forest. The total value of $44,724,232.00 resulted
a blended rate for the 16,669.01 hectares of Vermont Park of $2,683.00 per
hectare. Mr McLay then added $930,000.00 for the structural
improvements to
quantify the before value at $45,650,000.00.
[44] Although
the conclusions of the valuers were vastly different, the methodology adopted by
them was similar; the disparity was,
as the valuers made plain, that the valuers
had different opinions of the proper classifications of land and the value of
depending upon that classification.
[45] The primary
judge was correct in reaching the conclusion that the valuers agreed that the
property Jimarndy was the most comparable
property to Vermont Park, as it had a
similar land area and a comparable mix of scrub, forest and river
As the primary judge
accurately recorded, Mr McLay had conceded that Jimarndy was superior in the
sense that it had greater proportions
of non-remnant land, meaning that it had a
greater proportion of cleared land, but it also had the disadvantage of regular
and severances with the Isaac River
floodplain.
Mr McLay explained
that the blended hectare rate of $2,717.00 per hectare for Jimarndy was the most
comparable land having been the
most recent sale (at September 2022), despite
the differences.
[46] Mr McLay
explained his reasoning; Jimarndy and Vermont Park had similar land areas,
Jimarndy had a slightly superior stocking
rate of 9.6%, and the properties had a
comparable mix of scrub, forest and river frontage country. Jimarndy had a
greater proportion
of developed land but had the disadvantage of regular
inundation with severances within the Isaac River
floodplain.
[47] Mr McLay
then reasoned with respect to those five (differential) features that justified
the differential blended per hectare
rate of $2,717.00 for Jimarndy and
$2,683.00 for Vermont Park. Accordingly, Mr McLay's tripartite classification of
the land of Vermont
Park and his adoption of the value rates per hectare for
each different class, resulted in an overall valuation of $45,650,000.00
blended rate of $2,683.00 per hectare, most closely aligns with the most
comparable sale.
[48] The primary
judge was faced with the circumstance that in the abstract, two valuers
utilising the same orthodox methodology had
arrived at vastly different
valuations. However, Mr McLay's valuation did have the advantage of not
only being a logical and orthodox
application, but as was demonstrated, it was
referenced back to the market value of the most comparable property,
[49] As the
primary judge observed “Mr McLay's assessment of $2,683.00 per hectare for
Vermont Park as against Jimarndy at $2,687.00
would appear to be the more
logical conclusion.”
Respectfully, the primary judge was correct in that analysis. However, the
primary judge then reasoned “however, that analysis
ignores the fact that
Vermont Park has a significantly lower carrying capacity than Jimarndy and that
Mr McLay has overstated the
carrying capacity of Vermont Park.”
[50] It is in
this last observational caveat that the primary judge has fallen into error. As
the primary judge had correctly stated,
the less comparable property of
Berrigurra was assessed by both valuers as a superior property, but
counter-intuitively it had a
significantly lower carrying capacity than Vermont
Park. Therefore, as both valuers said and as the primary judge had accurately
observed, there can be no direct correlation between a property's carrying
capacity and its value.
capacity is but one of many factors that a valuer may take into account, and the
effect of carrying capacity is a matter
of evidence in each case.
[51] As stated
above in respect of the
test and as observed by Griffiths CJ, the
assumption is that both the seller and the buyer must be placed in “the
of persons conversant with the subject”. As stated by Isaacs J in
at 441, it is assessed that both parties are “perfectly
acquainted with the land and cognisant of all circumstances which might
its value... including its situation, character, quality.”
Berrigurra sale demonstrates that it is a mistake to intuitively assume that a
property's carrying capacity has a direct
or mathematical relationship to a
property's market value, and as was repeatedly pointed out in the JVR, both
valuers opined that
it was a mistake to value Vermont Park on the basis of
carrying capacity, as such an approach was
subjective.
[53] The use
made of carrying capacity before the primary judge was limited to its use as a
means to test the accuracy of the value
rates for each type of land as
classified by each valuer. Even in that regard, it had extremely little impact.
The valuers were right
to reject carrying capacity, however assessed, as a
primary, important or direct variable in the valuation of rural land. Indeed,
the term ‘carrying capacity’ was referred to 24 times in the hearing
and in submissions – which all served to confirm
that it was not used as a
valuation method.
conjecture inherent in any carrying capacity analysis may be observed on the
face of the Forage Report: Long-Term Carrying
Capacity reports proved in
evidence before the primary judge. The forage reports defined the long-term
carrying capacity (‘
’) as an estimate of the number of
livestock a property can support over a long period (decades) without causing
land degradation.
[55] The LTCC
for Vermont Park was noted at 2766 in the forage report of 4 May 2022,
whereas less than two years later, on 28 March
2024, it had improved to 3232.
That is an increase of 16% of the decade-long average, within two years. More
importantly, the disclaimer
of the report states: “The purpose of the
report is to provide an objectively estimated LTCC for the property which can be
used as a starting point for discussion and to add input for further analysis
(i.e. use spreadsheet supplied along with this report
to improve the LTCC
estimates). Values given for the LTCC are an indication only, significant
management of property grazing pressure
is still required on a season to season
basis (i.e. forage budgeting).” Perhaps the accuracy of that comment is
demonstrated
by the 2018 to 2022 average actual carry capacity of Vermont Park
of 5081 head of cattle.
[56] As carrying
capacity analysis was demonstrated to be an unreliable metric and positively
rejected by both experienced valuers
as such, it cannot be used to negatively
adjust Mr McLay's valuation as no ‘prudent’ purchaser or seller
would rely on
an unreliable metric. Even if, as the primary judge observed, Mr
McLay had overestimated Vermont Park's carrying capacity, it is
clear that Mr
McLay did not rely on carrying capacity to arrive at his conclusion.
evidence made it plain that carring capacity could not properly be used as a
basis for quantifying the value of Vermont Park.
The primary judge's conclusion
that the before value of Vermont Park ought to be valued at $31,561,465.00 was
calculated by the primary
judge utilising the ratio between Jimarndy's stocking
rate and Vermont Park's stocking rate of 4.01 divided by 5.8, multiplied by
McLay's valuation of $45,650,000.00 to arrive at the valuation of
$31,561,465.00. Such a quantification was not open upon the
evidence; nor as a
matter of logic.
[58] Indeed, the
carrying capacity and the stocking rate of cattle properties are two quite
different things. The carrying capacity
of a particular property is an estimated
number which varies vastly when a property is being stocked, de-stocked, or
over-stocked,
which can happen for a variety of reasons, including weather
conditions and market forces.
[59] The Land
Court is not bound by expert evidence. In
Leichhardt Council v Roads and
Traffic Authority (NSW)
(2006) 149 LGERA 439
; [2006] NSWCA 435, Spigelman CJ
said (with whom Beasley, Bryson, Basten JJA and Campbell J agreed), at 83:
"...This is not a jurisdiction in which a judicial valuer is
obliged to act only on the basis of evidence adduced by expert valuers
appear as witnesses. A judge of the Land and Environment Court is perfectly
entitled to reject the whole of the expert evidence
and drawing on the
experience of the court to do the best as s/he can to identify an appropriate
level of discount or, relevantly
an appropriate quantum of adjustment to the
comparable sales figure by reason of the existing use of rights of some of those
[60] The primary
judge was not bound to accept Mr McLay's valuation at $45,650,000.00 and was
entitled to use the court's experience
to identify an “appropriate level
of discount” or “appropriate quantum of adjustment to the comparable
sales figure”.
That adjustment must be made by reference to the
differential characteristics of the property undertaken in an "appropriate"
[61] As may be
observed from Mr McLay's evidence, he had decreased the blended average rate for
Jimarndy by about 1% on the agreed
basis that Jimarndy was the most comparable
sale to Vermont Park.
approach of the primary judge in using the unreliable metric of carrying
capacity resulted in a 40% decrease to the closest
comparable sale, which cannot
test be accepted as being correct.
[63] Mr McLay's
conclusion of the market value of Vermont Park at $45,650,000.00 is a reduction
on the comparable sale price of Jimarndy
by about 1.3%. Although a discount of
1.3% is relatively small, the important characteristics of Jimarndy relative to
Vermont Park
show that Jimarndy and Vermont Park are closely comparable.
[64] Firstly,
both properties are relatively large properties, with Jimarndy being 17,368.3
hectares and Vermont Park 16,669.01 hectares.
That is, as Mr McLay accurately
says, a 4.2% variance. Whilst there are some differences, Mr McLay's conclusion
that the properties
have a comparable mixture of scrub, forest and river
frontage country is a fair and open conclusion.
[65] Vermont
Park has the advantages that it is sufficiently high to avoid the regular
inundation suffered by Jimarndy. It also avoids
the severances of the Jimarndy
property within the Isaac River floodplain. In this respect, Vermont Park is
superior to Jimarndy.
[66] However, on
the extremely unreliable metric of carrying capacity and based on the 2022
carrying capacity figures, Jimarndy had
a superior 9.6% additional carrying
capacity over Vermont Park. When analysed with respect to the 2024 carrying
capacity, however,
that unreliable metric differential evaporates.
[67] In the
circumstances, therefore, even if all expert evidence was rejected and a
judicial evaluation was undertaken, the most
appropriate method would be to
conclude Jimarndy was the most comparable property and then to select an
appropriate level of discount.
The discount ought, on the facts, to be very
small – in the vicinity of 1.3% and not in the vicinity of 40%.
[68] It follows
that the primary judge's judicial valuation of the before value of Vermont Park
at $31,561,465.00 was incorrect. Furthermore,
the appellant's submission that
they have been denied natural justice by the primary judge adopting a
methodology for the valuation
of Vermont Park, which was unknown to the parties
and unknowable to the parties, ought to be
[69] Although it
is true that carrying capacity was utilised in cross-examination as a basis to
attack the valuers' classification
of land and value of land type, it was, as
stated above, the firm common view of both expert valuers that the usage of
carrying capacity
to value the rural property was inappropriate, as the metric
was unreliable and subject to too much conjecture.
[70] It follows,
therefore, that the appellant could not have reasonably foreseen that any
judicial valuation would be undertaken
by reference to carrying capacity when
that had been emphatically rejected by both experts.
[71] While the
appellants have been denied natural justice by the primary judge utilising a
valuation methodology which was unforeseen
and unforeseeable on the evidence,
there is no utility in remitting the matter to the Land Court. There is ample,
carefully tested
evidence upon which a proper conclusion as to compensation can
be deduced.
[72] We would
conclude that the primary judge was in error in rejecting Mr McLay’s
before valuation of Vermont Park at $45,650,000.00
which is a 1.3% reduction in
value to the comparable property Jimarndy.
[73] Utilising a
“before” valuation of Vermont Park at $45,650,000.00 and adopting
the diminution rates utilised by the
primary judge results in a loss in value in
respect of Vermont Park which ought to be calculated using a similar methodology
in the primary judgment at [76].
adoption of a before valuation of Vermont Park at $45,650,000.00 results in a
before value for the mining lease at $25,472,700.00
(calculated as
x $45,650,000). This
leaves $20,177,300 or 44.2% of total value to be allocated between the Homestead
($149,822), South-western balance
land (8,200ha), Eastern balance land
(224.79ha) and Improvements at $800,000. Adopting the Homestead value as
$149,822 as at [54]
of the primary judgment and Improvements at $800,000 as at
[69] of the primary judgment, leaves an area of 8424.79ha in South-western
balance land (8700ha) and Eastern balance land (224.79ha) which is valued at
$19,227,478 ($20,177,300 - $149,822 - $800,000). This
results in a before value
for the Southwest balance land of $18,714,451 (8,200ha ÷
x ($20,177,300 -
$149,822 - $800,000)) and a before value for the Eastern balance land of
$513,027 (224.79ha ÷ 8,424.79ha x
($20,177,300 - $149,822 - $800,000).
Utilising the before valuation of Vermont Park at $45,650,000.00 but otherwise
utilising the
same methodology adopted by the trial judge results in a loss of
value for Vermont Park as set out in the table

value of Vermont Park of $31,376,715.00 is calculated in the above table and
utilises a similar methodology as set
out in the table utilised by the primary
judge at [76] of the judgment. An anomaly in the table at [76] of the primary
judgment is
that the quantification of the before value according to the table
is $34,512,809.00 and not the amount of $31,561,465.00 found by
the primary
judge, at [47], to be the before value of Vermont Park. That anomaly has been
removed in the analysis above.
[76] The loss
quantification is performed on the basis of the grazing value of the property,
that is the total of $45,650,000.00 less
improvements $800,000.00 and less the
the primary
judge, the mining lease occupies 8,168 hectares of Vermont Park
which is approximately 49% of the property land mass. However, both
valuers had
agreed that the value of the mining lease with respect to Vermont Park ought to
be quantified at 55.8% and accordingly,
the before value of the mining lease
area is quantified at 55.8% of $45,650,000.00 rather than 49% of $45,650,000.00.
The increase
in the quantification of the mining lease area from 49% to 55.8%
reflects the valuers’ joint view that the mining lease occupies
the most valuable and useful land on Vermont Park, the remaining lands being the
south west balance lands of 8,200ha and
the eastern balance lands of 224.79ha,
which must therefore be allocated 44.2% of the value of the grazing land of
$44,700,178.00.
The above analysis disposes of grounds 1 to 7 of the appeal and
grounds 1 to 6 of the cross appeal.
Ground Eight: Diminution
rate for South West balance land
[77] As may be
observed from Figure Map 8 in paragraph 8, the effect of the proposed mining
lease is that it creates a very large
but irregularly shaped south-west balance
land. The south-west balance land is approximately 8,200 hectares.
[78] The effect
of the granting of a mining lease upon agricultural land is that it may create
balance lots. The numerous characteristics
of a newly created balance lots are
to be taken into account, as required in the
test. In the present
case, a good example is the eastern balance land, which has an area of 224.79
hectares. Both valuers agree that
because of the small size of the eastern
balance land and its position in isolation, the eastern balance land has no
value as agricultural
land. Accordingly, both valuers agree that the diminution
rate for the eastern balance land is 100%.
[79] The large
south-western balance land does have value. However, its value has been affected
by the positioning of the mining lease,
and the effect the mining lease would
have upon the utility of the balance land is an important matter that any
prudent purchaser
would take into account in determining the price that
purchaser would pay for the land. This principle was discussed by President
Trickett in
Mitchell v Oakhill and Mitchell
(1989) 19 QLCR 66 at pages
73-74. In that case, as there was a lack of valuation evidence as to the proper
effect of the diminution,
the President was placed in a situation where there
was no option other than to allow a nominal figure of $20,000.00 for all loss
sustained under
section 281(3)(a)(i)
to (v) of the
Mineral Resources Act
, which included in
section 281(3)(a)(iii)
“compensation for
the diminution of the use made or which may be made of land of the owner or any
improvements thereon”.
[80] In the
present case, the primary judge did have valuation evidence as to the proper
diminution in the use of the south-west balance
land, with Mr Cavanagh opining
the diminution rate at 25% and Mr McLay opining the diminution rate at 30%. The
primary judge accepted
Mr Cavanagh's opinion on this issue. The appellant refers
to the well-accepted principle in cases of compulsory acquisition that
a case of compensation, doubts are resolved in favour of a more liberal
estimate...”.
appellant's argument is that the primary judge was in error in accepting
Mr Cavanagh's more conservative 25% diminution rate
than Mr McLay's 30%
diminution rate, simply because of the principle that doubts are resolved in
favour of a more liberal estimate.
[82] In terms of
the quantification of the diminution effect of a mining lease, both valuers
agreed that the sale of the rural property
Broadlea was the only evidence
available to support a diminution rate for the balance land connected with
mining leases granted for
surface mining activities. Both valuers agreed that
the Broadlea sale showed a diminution rate of 23.5% over the land outside the
existing mining leases.
[83] Mr Cavanagh
then reasoned that the diminution rate for Vermont Park would be slightly more
generous than Broadlea even though
he pointed out that it was arguable that the
impacts on Broadlea were greater than those envisaged for Vermont Park, as the
of the four mining leases upon Broadlea was to create four parcels of
severed or balance land, and the property was significantly
more impacted by
infrastructure-related activities, including a train load-out facility and
railway line.
[84] Mr Cavanagh
pointed out that in respect of the proposed mining lease for Vermont Park, there
would be several surface mining
pits. However, there were significantly less
infrastructure-related activities in that the mining plan for Vermont Park
only an overland conveyor and an access road, in addition to the
surface mining activities. In this regard, it is apparent that Mr
Cavanagh did
apply a generous approach.
[85] Mr McLay's
reasoning for providing a higher diminution rate at 30% was essentially because
the sale of Broadlea occurred while
mining was being conducted upon Broadlea,
the purchaser could observe all of the infrastructure and the effect of the
mining lease,
whereas for Vermont Park, it could not be observed. The primary
judge concluded that the diminution rate to be applied ought to be
more than the
23.5% made for Broadlea, but reasoned that the level of uncertainty of the
greenfield mining site at Vermont Park did
not justify an extra 6.5% diminution,
particularly, as accurately observed, the actual impact of the mining lease in
Vermont Park
is likely to be less than that experienced at Broadlea. In those
circumstances, it was open to the primary judge to prefer Mr Cavanagh's
assessment of a 25% diminution, which was, nonetheless, a generous assessment in
keeping with the above authorities.
Other losses
[86] Ground nine
of the notice of appeal raises not only the losses associated with relocating
and agisting the breeding herd currently
de-pastured on Vermont Park and on part
of Seloh Nolem, but additionally “the costs of the ongoing operation
attributable to
operating a replacement property and the cost to relocate
cattle.” The primary judge rejected the appellant's claim for additional
operating costs because “the costs of operating the cattle enterprise lies
with Seamark, not Namrog or
The primary
judge similarly rejected any claim for the cost to relocate cattle as
“given Seamark owns the cattle, it is difficult
to see why Namrog and
Balanced should be compensated for their
relocation.”
appellant argues that the primary judge erred in these conclusions and that such
losses were properly recoverable by a landowner
pursuant to
section 281(3)
Section 281
281 Determination of compensation
by Land Court
(1) At any time before an agreement is made under
section 279
person who could be a party to the agreement may apply in writing to the Land
Court to have the Land Court determine the amount
of compensation.
The persons who could be parties to the agreement may also agree to
participate in ADR under
sections 283C
to determine the amount of
compensation.
(2) The Land Court is hereby authorised to hear and determine matters
referred to in subsection (1).
(3) Upon an application made under subsection (1), the Land Court shall
settle the amount of compensation an owner of land is entitled
compensation for—
(a) in the case of compensation referred to in
section 279
(i) deprivation of possession of the surface of land of the owner;
(ii) diminution of the value of the land of the owner or any improvements
(iii) diminution of the use made or which may be made of the land of the owner
or any improvements thereon;
(iv) severance of any part of the land from other parts thereof or from other
land of the owner;
(v) any surface rights of access;
(vi) all loss or expense that arises;
as a consequence of the grant or renewal of the mining lease; and
(b) in the case of compensation referred to in
section 280
(i) diminution of the value of the land of the owner or any improvements
(ii) diminution of the use made or which may be made of the land of the owner or
any improvements thereon;
(iii) all loss or expense that arises;
as a consequence of the grant or renewal of the mining lease.
(4) In assessing the amount of compensation payable under subsection
(a) where it is necessary for the owner of land to obtain replacement land of a
similar productivity, nature and area or resettle
himself or herself or relocate
his or her livestock and other chattels on other parts of his or her land or on
the replacement land,
all reasonable costs incurred or likely to be incurred by
the owner in obtaining replacement land, the owner’s resettlement
relocation of the owner’s livestock or other chattels as at the date of
the assessment shall be considered;
(b) no allowance shall be made for any minerals that are or may be on or under
the surface of the land concerned;
(c) if the owner of land proves that the status and use currently being made
(prior to the application for the grant of the mining
lease) of certain land is
such that a premium should be applied—an appropriate amount of
compensation may be determined;
(d) loss that arises may include loss of profits to the owner calculated by
comparison of the usage being made of land prior to the
lodgement of the
relevant application for the grant of a mining lease and the usage that could be
made of that land after the grant;
(e) an additional amount shall be determined to reflect the compulsory nature of
action taken under this part which amount, together
with any amount determined
pursuant to paragraph (c), shall be not less than 10% of the aggregate amount
determined under subsection
(5) In any case the Land Court may determine the amounts and the terms,
conditions and times when payments aggregating the total
compensation payable
shall be payable.
(6) An amount of compensation decided by agreement between the parties, or
by the Land Court, is binding on the parties and the parties’
representatives, successors and assigns.
(7) The Land Court shall give written notice of its determination to all
parties and may make such order as to costs between the
parties to the
determination as it thinks fit.
[88] Whilst it
is true in terms of
section 281(4)(a)
MRA that the landowners Namrog and
Balanced do not own the livestock and it follows that there can be no relocation
of the “owner's”
livestock, the chapeau to
section 281(4)
the amount of compensation payable under
section 281
is to be assessed under
section 281(3)
MRA. In this regard,
sections 281(4)(a)
, (b), (c), (d), and (e)
add to the proper compensation that may be assessable under
section 281(3)
does not limit or otherwise confine the proper compensation assessable under
section 281(3)
particular, the test under
section 281(3)(a)(vi)
MRA is that the Land Court is
required to assess the amount of compensation an owner of land is entitled to
for “all loss or
expense that arises as a consequence of the grant or
renewal of the mining lease.”
relevant question, therefore, is not which company owns the cattle but rather
whether either landowners, Namrog or Balanced,
suffer a loss or expense as a
consequence of the grant of the mining lease. The uncontested evidence is that
as Seamark is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Namrog, so that any loss or expense
suffered by Seamark as a consequence of the grant of the mining lease is
suffered by Namrog.
[91] Mr Ashby is
a forensic accountant who was retained by the landowners. He explained the loss
in an uncontested fashion.
the uncontested facts, there were only two alternatives in respect of the costs
to relocate cattle and the costs incurred with
respect to the ongoing management
of the cattle. Mr Ashby's evidence was that Seamark could fund those losses by
two possible means.
The first was through additional monies (an inter-company
loan) from the holding company Namrog to Seamark to pay for those costs,
the alternative, where there was no inter-company loan, so that Seamark would
bear the costs itself. In this latter scenario
when Seamark suffered the loss,
that loss caused a diminution in the value of Seamark's net assets, which in
turn decreased the value
of the shares owned by Namrog in Seamark.
[92] In either
scenario, Namrog, as the holding company, suffers a loss. This proposition was
theoretically and evidentially sound.
And that is perhaps why it was not the
subject of any challenge. Despite that, the uncontradicted evidence was rejected
by the primary
[93] The primary
judge's rejection of the uncontested evidence, which was evidentially and
theoretically sound, is not a proper basis
to deny the appellant compensation.
[94] As observed
by the primary judge, the valuers had agreed the cost to relocate the cattle
ought to be allowed. The losses sustained
by the relocation of one-half of the
breeding herd due to the granting of the mining lease were calculated in Mr
Ashby’s report
of 8 July 2024 and summarised in figure
quantification of the net present value of the additional relocation costs
totalled $4,134,233.00. Mr Ashby's model assumes
that one-half of the breeding
herd would be removed on 1 July 2025 and then agisted for three financial
years before a replacement
property was found in the 2029 financial year, at
which time the cattle would be moved from the agisted property to the newly
replacement property. The primary judge rejected the claim for
agistment. The appellant asserted that the primary judge erred in
conclusion.
Agistment costs
[95] The owners
make a substantial claim for agistment costs based upon the argument that upon
the granting of the mining lease, the
owners will need to immediately remove
thousands of cattle from the subject properties.
[96] The primary
judge rejected the agistment claim on two bases. The first was that the
agistment loss falls to the cattle owners,
Seamark, and not the landowner,
Namrog or Balanced. As discussed above, the primary judge fell into error in
this determination.
The second basis was the primary judge rejected the premise
for the quantification of agistment costs considering that the cattle
need to be immediately removed if the mining lease was granted.
[97] The primary
judge's approach was to accept as correct the statement of principle in
& Parkinson v BHP Coal Pty Ltd & Ors [No 2]; BHP Coal Pty Ltd & Ors
v Berry & Parkinson [No 2]
(1998) 19 QLCR 366
at 376 that an arrangement
to allow the use of a mining lease is generally not relevant if not settled,
however, a court can take
into account such an arrangement where there is a
clear and unambiguous offer from the miner which, if accepted, would offset
of the compensation claim.
relevant sections which impact upon this issue are
sections 235
which provide as follows:
235 General entitlements of holder of

(1) Subject to
section 236
and chapter 8,
, division 1, during the
currency of a mining lease, the holder of the mining lease and any person who
acts as agent or employee of
the holder (or who delivers goods or substances or
provides services to the holder) for a purpose or right for which the mining
is granted—
(a) may enter and be—
(i) within the area of the mining lease; and
(ii) upon the surface area comprised in the mining lease;
for any purpose for which the mining lease is granted or for any purpose
permitted or required under the lease or by this Act;
(b) may do all such things as are permitted or required under the lease or by
this Act, including plugging and abandoning, or otherwise
remediating, a legacy
borehole and rehabilitating the surrounding area in compliance with the
requirements prescribed under a regulation.
(2) During the currency of the mining lease, the rights of the holder relate,
and are taken to have always related, to the whole of
the land and surface area
mentioned in subsection (1).
403 Offences regarding land subject to mining claim or mining
(1) A person shall not—
(a) enter or be upon land; or
(b) use or occupy land; or
(c) erect any building or structure on or make any other improvement to land;
that is the subject of a mining claim or the surface area of a mining lease
(d) the person is authorised by or under this Act, any other Act relating to
mining, the GHG storage Act or the Geothermal Act in
that regard; or
(e) the person is the owner of the land or is authorised in that behalf by the
owner and, in either case, the person has the consent
of the holder of the
mining claim or, as the case may be, mining lease.
(2) Subsection (1)(a) shall not operate to prevent a police officer or an
inspector or other person appointed or authorised under
any Act or law to enter
land for the purpose of carrying out duties from so entering and carrying out
those duties.

“However, I do not accept that the impact of the lease is to deprive
the owner of the use of the whole of the lease area for
the term of the lease.
The effect of
Mineral Resources Act
is that the lessee is entitled
to go on to and remain on the mining lease area for purposes connected with
mining only. The mining
lessee is not given a right to exclusive possession of
the lease area.
Section 403
of the Act creates certain statutory offences in
relation to unauthorised entry onto the lease area. Neither section grants
possession rights to the lessee nor enables the lessee to prevent
unauthorised entry onto the lease area. It is clear from the respondents'
submissions that they do not object to the applicant's cattle continuing to
graze on those parts of the mining lease area that are
not from time to time
disturbed by the mining operations. Thus in assessing loss suffered from the
deprivation of possession of the
surface land as a result of the lease under
s.281(3)(a)(i)
the fact that the landowner may continue to graze his cattle on
the undisturbed area of the mining lease should be taken into account.

lease was granted on 1 July 2002 with the area of operations defined in the
mining lease plan limited to only 1.752 hectares.
[101] Whilst the
miners were limited by their current area of operations, they could make further
application at any time to amend
that area. The original grant of mining lease
was over an area of 71.2743 hectares, but only the very small portion of 1.752
could be disturbed without further application being made.
[102] Accordingly,
President MacDonald's conclusions at [26] were based upon a lease that in fact
existed and which made reference
to a very limited area of disturbance.
President MacDonald's decision in
was cited with approval in
Pembroke Olive Downs Pty Ltd v Namrog Investments Pty Ltd
Pembroke Olive Downs
[2025] QCA 87

observed by
section 235(1)(b)

things as are permitted or required under the lease or by this Act.
case, under the lease, the holder of the mining lease was
permitted only to disturb 1.752 hectares without further application and
accordingly under that lease, it was plain that the mining lessee was not given
the right to exclusive possession of the whole of
the lease area, which
comprised 71.2743 hectares.
[105] It is also
clear, as pointed out recently by the Court of Appeal in
Pembroke Olive
, that on application of
sections 235
MRA, it cannot
automatically be assumed that a mining lease would grant exclusive possession of
the mining lease area to the holder
of the mining lease. For example, as
provided in
section 403(1)(e)
MRA an owner may obtain the consent of the holder
of the mining lease to enter upon the mining lease area.
[106] It is
therefore a matter of negotiation and agreement, which may be evidenced by the
mining lease itself, or as set out in
case in another settled

acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in
Pembroke Olive Downs
seeks to obtain a balance between the rights of landowners and miners and in
part is protective of the rights of landowners.
Compensation for the compulsory
acquisition of an owner's land ought not be approached in a manner which is
dismissive of the rights
of the landowners.
[109] In our
view, the reasoning of
case ought to be accepted. That is,
generally, unless there is a settled agreement, an arrangement for the use of
the land is not
relevant. However, if there is a clear and unambiguous offer
from a miner which, if accepted, would offset aspects of the compensation
then that may be taken into account. A landowner cannot create a compensable
loss by rejecting a reasonable offer or refusing
to negotiate when a miner makes
a reasonable offer. The duty to mitigate loss is not confined to a breach of
contract or tort but
applies throughout the law of the assessment of damages,
loss, or compensation. As Isaacs J said in
Ardlethan Options Ltd v
[1915] HCA 53
(1915) 20 CLR 285
at 296 “...every person claiming damages is
bound, to do all things reasonable to mitigate his loss.”
[110] In the
present case, as stated by the primary judge, there was evidence from Pembroke's
chief operating officer that Pembroke
would not start work on the mining lease
until mid-2028 and would allow the owners full access to the land until that
may be construed as a clear and unambiguous offer from the miner,
which, if accepted, would offset any loss of agistment claim at
least until
mid-2028. The offer provided Seamark a period of almost three years to remove
the cattle it owns. The offer reflects
the submission of the appellant, that it
will take three years to locate and bring a replacement property up to
production. The offer
is clear evidence of the owner’s authorisation to
utilise the leased area in terms of
MRA. In the circumstances, the
primary judge was right to reject the agistment claim on that basis alone.
Relocation costs
discussed above, it would appear that evidentially, agistment costs for the next
three financial years ought not be allowed,
as the mining lease will not be
developed for at least another three years, and Pembroke has given the
landowners consent to use
the property for grazing purposes for that period.
What is plain, however, is that after then, in the 2029 financial year, the
will need to be removed from the mining lease areas and transported to a
replacement property. There is 3 years to obtain a suitable
replacement
property, in circumstances where the appellants have agitated for 3 years as
being a reasonable period to find a suitable
[112] Accordingly,
it seems that the losses quantified by Mr Ashby for the 2026, 2027, and 2028
financial years ought not be allowed.
However, the loss sustained in the 2029
financial year, quantified as $2,308,173.00 is the loss which, in terms of
section 281(3)(a)(vi)
MRA is a loss that arises to Namrog as the holding company
for Seamark. Therefore, the proper quantification of damages is the net
value of that projected loss in 2029, calculated by Mr Ashby as
$1,513,875.00. That sum ought to have been allowed as compensation
Additional operating costs
appellants' claim for additional operating costs ought to have been allowed as
compensation to Namrog on the same basis
as the costs for relocation of the
cattle owned by Seamark.
[114] The basic
principle for the assessment of a compensable loss is to quantify the sum of
money which will place the injured party
in the same position that that party
would have been in, had the event causing the loss not occurred. The position
before the issue
of a mining lease was that the Vermont Park-Seloh Nolem
aggregation could be efficiently operated by one management team, on a large
rural breeding property.
[115] The loss
of essentially half the use of the land in turn causes the owners to relocate
half the herd, which will occur within
three years. The replacement land, of
course, has not been identified. It may be within a 250-kilometre radius of the
Vermont Park-Seloh
Nolem aggregation, as opined by Mr Cavanagh or within a
500-kilometre radius of the Vermont Park-Seloh Nolem aggregation, as suggested
by Mr McLay.
[116] In either
case, the consequence is that the management of the cattle enterprise is
significantly different. Whilst both valuers
recognised that the loss would be
sustained, they took a very different view as to how that loss should be
quantified. Mr McLay's
opinion was that to operate a property which was not
aggregated as the Vermont Park-Seloh Nolem properties were, would result in
additional farmhand being employed at the new property at a cost of $84,294.00
per annum, plus an additional cost of a vehicle
at $30,000.00 per annum, which
if capitalised as an annual expense in perpetuity at 3.25%, quantified the loss
at $3,522,561.00.
[117] Mr Ashby
undertook a similar analysis but quantified a larger loss, upon the assumption
that the incremental wages for a manager
would be $131,250.00 per annum.
[118] On the far
more conservative side was Mr Cavanagh's opinion, that all that was required was
one person to undertake a 500-kilometre
round trip once every fortnight for
30 years, discounted at 10%, quantifying additional costs at $135,540.00.
primary judge rejected the assessment of additional operational costs but stated
that if minded to allow compensation for
the additional operational costs, would
have accepted Mr Cavanagh's opinion that it would be in the order of
$135,540.00.
replacement property has not been found, it cannot be demonstrated that
Mr Cavanagh's assumption that a replacement property
250 kilometres from
Vermont Park is incorrect. As the JVR
, Mr Cavanagh's thesis is
that what ought to be allowed is only the travel time of five hours, being 250
kilometres each way, together
with the vehicle expenses at $0.72 per kilometre.
Mr Cavanagh's thesis is that the compensable loss is only the additional costs
involved in the travel of one person from the current Vermont Park-Seloh Nolem
aggregation to the new property, undertaken once a
[121] Mr McLay
rejected Mr Cavanagh's quantification, stating “most-larger scale, rural
properties have at least one full-time
employee. In my view, it is very unlikely
that a replacement property can be effectively managed on a one-day per
fortnight basis.”
primary judge did not address the critical difference in expert opinion between
Mr Cavanagh proposing that a several thousand
hectare rural property
carrying between 2,000 to 3,000 head of cattle could be managed by working as
little as one day a fortnight,
and Mr McLay's opinion that that was “very
unlikely” and that at least one full-time employee would be required other
than by commenting, “I cannot envisage a situation where the additional
labour would be required in perpetuity, given the advances
in technology that
have occurred and are likely to continue.”
[123] There is
no evidence from the valuers, nor any experienced cattleman, nor any witnesses,
as to what advances in technology had
occurred or which might occur, such as to
render the operational requirements for a large cattle property down to as
little as one
day's work per fortnight. There is accordingly no sound basis upon
which to accept Mr Cavanagh's quantification at $135,540.00.
[124] Mr McLay's
model, which is similar to Mr Ashby's model, quantifying the loss at
$3,522,561.00 has not been shown to be incorrect
and is based upon the most
reasonable of assumptions, namely that one additional farm hand would be
required to perform the work
due to the disaggregation of the properties.
discussed above, although Seamark as cattle owner suffers the loss, it is also a
loss directly suffered by Namrog as the
owner of Seamark. Accordingly, Namrog
ought to be allowed compensation at $3,522,561.00 in respect of the additional
operational
costs with respect to the resettlement of one half of the cattle on
a replacement property, to be acquired.
Seloh Nolem
majority of the primary judgment and the grounds of appeal and cross-appeal
relate to the compensation assessed in respect
of the mining lease upon Vermont
Park or both Vermont Park and Seloh Nolem. Ground 8(b) of the appeal and grounds
5, 6, 7 and 8 of
the cross appeal solely concern the primary judge's assessment
of compensation in respect of Seloh Nolem.
[127] Paragraph
8(b) of the grounds of appeal raises the argument that the primary judge fell
into error in rejecting Mr McLay’s
evidence that the diminution rate for
the eastern balance land, opined by Mr McLay at 17.5%, ought to have been
accepted, and that
the primary judge fell into error in accepting the evidence
of Mr Cavanagh of a 5% diminution rate for the eastern balance land.
primary judge rejected Mr McClay’s much higher estimate of 17.5% for the
diminution rate as it was based on the Broadlea
argument. As discussed above, at
[77] to [85], that argument ought to be rejected as the potential impact is
easily discernible by
a “prudent” purchaser. Importantly the impact
on the Eastern balance land was minimal and so Mr Cavanagh’
diminishment rate was reasonable.
[129] As to
grounds 5 and 6 of the cross appeal, as is demonstrated in figure eight, all of
the mining pits and the vast disturbance
to the land will occur upon Vermont
Park. The disturbance caused by the mining lease upon Seloh Nolem is limited to
an area of 1,185
hectares in the southwest corner of Seloh Nolem. Seloh Nolem is
some 8,615 hectares, thus the mining lease is approximately 14% of
Seloh Nolem.
As the mining lease upon Seloh Nolem is to be used only for infrastructure,
namely a conveyor and a haul road, the impact
upon Seloh Nolem is significantly
less than the impact upon Vermont Park.
primary judge's approach in respect of Seloh Nolem was to accept there was a
total loss of the value of the west balance
land (valued at $150,000) and a
total loss of the mining lease area of 1,185 hectares and to allow that at a
rate of $4,385.70 per
hectare. The primary judge quantified the rate of
$4,385.70 per hectare by reference to two comparable sales, namely the Maynes
and the Morpeth sale. No challenge is brought to the primary judge's
approach in this regard. Although, as acknowledged at [28]
to [39], ground 2 of
the cross-appeal has merit, it does not follow that the primary Judge erred in
not accepting Mr Cavanagh’s
opinion as to the value of Seloh Nolem. As
discussed at [59], the primary Judge was entitled to reject Mr Cavanagh’s
and value the property by making “appropriate” adjustments
to comparable sales. This is precisely what the primary Judge
did, and it has
not been demonstrated that there was any error in that approach. It is for that
reason that grounds five and six
of the cross-appeal ought to be dismissed.
[131] Ground 7
of the cross appeal raises the ground of appeal that Seloh Nolem has not
suffered a loss of transaction costs to acquire
replacement land as the cattle
depastured upon Seloh Nolem are owned by Seamark.
discussed above, however, the loss is sustained not by Seloh Nolem but by
Seamark and therefore Namrog as Seamark as wholly
owned subsidiary of Namrog.
Grounds 7(a) and 7(b) of the cross appeal ought to be dismissed.
[133] As to
ground 7(c) of the cross appeal, the argument brought is that as the severance
area is approximately 14% of the total
area of Seloh Nolem, the majority of
Seloh Nolem is not affected by the granting of the mining lease, so there ought
to be no allowance
for transaction costs to acquire replacement land. That
ground of appeal ought to be rejected as although the mining lease only occupies
approximately 14% of Seloh Nolem, it still renders 1,185 hectares to be lost, in
respect of which the owner of Seloh Nolem, Balanced,
is entitled to proper
compensation in order to acquire replacement land. Although 1,185 hectares is a
relatively small area compared
to the Vermont Park-Seloh Nolem aggregation, it
is still a substantial parcel of real property.
[134] As to
ground 8 of the cross-appeal, the stamp duty which flows from the quantification
assessment flows from the proper assessment
of the compensation and has not been
demonstrated to be incorrect.
cross-appeal in respect of Seloh Nolem ought therefore to be dismissed.
Similarly, the appeal in respect of Seloh Nolem
ought to be dismissed, other
than in respect of the replacement property premium as discussed below.
Replacement property premium
[136] Mr McLay
opined that a 35% premium should be allowed “for the potential cost the
landowner may incur to secure replacement
land above a competitor
Mr McLay’s reasons in paragraph 2211 of the JVR was
“given that the SN/VP aggregation with [sic] suffer a
significant loss of land as a result of the granting of the ML, the landowner
will be likely to be forced to acquire replacement land, in what has been
historically a thinly traded market, at a time which is
not of their choice. In
this regard, the landowner is left with the risk of acquiring a property
suitable to the business, with an
appropriate price range, and in a location
which is complementary to their existing assets.”
[137] In the
, Mr Cavanagh opined that no
premium ought to be allowed as “premiums are not consistent with the
test. They only favour one party in the transaction.” Mr
Cavanagh also made reference to the sale of several rural properties
2019 and 2022 to opine that “replacement land is available, and the market
continues to trade.”
Cavanagh further opined in paragraph 217 of the JVR that a premium “is
considered double dipping because
section 281(4)(e)
allows a minimum of 10% of
the aggregate to represent the compulsory nature of the process.”
premium issue between the valuers was addressed extensively in
cross-examination.
recorded, Mr McLay had increased the premium from 20% to 35%, upon the basis of
the more recent Apis creek sale.
matter of construction of
section 281(4)
MRA, it seems plain that a premium may
be allowed, if the evidence supports such a premium under
sections 281(4)(a)
(c) or (e) MRA. Each of those subsections are broadly drafted provisions, in
remedial legislation, intended to provide a generous
measure of compensation
afforded to landowners who have their land compulsorily acquired under the
provisions of the MRA. In the
present case, as replacement land has not been
purchased, in terms of
section 281(4)(a)
MRA, a premium may be allowed if it is
“likely” that the cost will be incurred.
[141] In the
present case, the valuers agree that it is necessary for the owner to obtain
replacement land of a similar productivity,
nature and area and relocate
livestock. In those circumstances,
section 281(4)(a)
MRA requires the assessment
of compensation to the landowner who has not yet purchased the replacement land
for compensation for
all reasonable costs likely to be incurred by the owner in
obtaining the replacement land.
[142] In his
evidence, Mr McLay pointed out that there was not any property currently
available in the Isaac Shire or Central Highlands
Shire that could be considered
a larger scale breeding property, such that there was no replacement land
available of similar productivity,
nature and area to resettle the
unchallenged demonstration of significant price increases for rural land
supports a high premium.
average yearly increase from 2017 to 2022 was 18.42%. Mr McLay points out that
the property Langley was sold in July 2020 for
$9.3 million and sold again in
November 2022 for $17 million - an increase of 82.8% in a period of only 16
response, Mr Cavanagh pointed out that Mr Perkins and Mr Newman had indicated
that replacement properties could be sourced
in other areas. Mr McLay conceded
that there were two breeding properties in the Theodore area, but they could not
be considered
replacement land as they were in a different area and were too
small. Mr Cavanagh was able to point initially to Mayfield as being
replacement. However, Mr Cavanagh conceded it was no longer on the market as it
had gone under contract and, in any event,
it was too small. Mr Cavanagh thought
there might be one suitable property available in Dingo, but he could not even
recall the name
of it. Both valuers agreed that cattle could be bred on
finishing country, but that did not make sense, because finishing country
more expensive.
evidence therefore before the primary judge was that, from Mr McLay, there were
no suitable properties available at all,
and on Mr Cavanagh's evidence that
there was perhaps an unknown property at Dingo, about which he could not recall
any details. The
only evidence before the primary judge, in terms of meeting the
objective of
section 281(4)(a)
MRA in assessing compensation for suitable
replacement land, was that there was a chance that an unknown property near
Dingo (more
than 250km from Vermont Park) may be available, and Mr McLay's
evidence that there were no such properties available for rural land,
steeply rising market. That would not seem to be a confident basis upon which to
predict that the landowner will be able to
obtain suitable replacement land at
historical market value.
[145] In these
circumstances, it is the overwhelming inference that the purchase of the
replacement land will be required to be undertaken
at a premium to historical
market value. However, in terms of
section 281(4)(a)
MRA, there is no reliable
evidence as to the likely level of that premium. It could be anywhere from 18%
to 92%. In this regard,
the premiums paid by mining companies of 9% to
may give a better guide
than the premium paid in respect of the Apis Creek transaction of 35%.
evidence strongly supports the conclusion that a premium will be paid as it is
likely there will be few, if any, suitable
The relatively slow
nature of the acquisition of large rural properties is demonstrated by Mr Gorman
requiring 25 years to acquire
his properties.
[147] Given the
nature of the task required of a court in assessing compensation as stated in
paragraphs [19] to [22] above, it appears
that in this case, that it is all but
certain that a high premium will be required. The problem is that there is only
the broadest
evidence as to what that premium is likely to be. The proper
solution is to utilise
section 281(4)(e)
MRA to increase the minimum additional
premium of 10% to a higher uplift to recognise the likely premium to be paid for
With respect to the land only, a proper premium on the evidence is
17.5%. The awarding of an additional 7.5% to 17.5% % is close
to the 2017-2022
average increase of 18.42% and one half of the Apis Creek premium of 35%, and
towards the lower end of the premiums
paid by mining companies. However, it is
the nature of
section 281(4)(e)
uplift that the percentage uplift chosen applies
to the aggregate assessed under
section 281(3).
The argument and evidence in the
trial and appeal relate to the premium to be paid for the loss of rural land.
The premium assessed
therefore ought to be accepted with respect to the rural
land of Vermont Park and Seloh Nolem but not the ancillary losses of relocation
fees and additional operation costs. In this case the correct approach is to
allow a premium of 15% for all losses at Vermont Park
and Seloh Nolem; as to
allow 17.5% on the land loss and a further 10% under
section 281(4)(e)
Mr Cavanagh said, amount to a ‘double dip’ on the premiums.
[148] Utilising
the methodology of the primary judge, but subject to the corrections identified
above, the proper compensation that
should be awarded is as
