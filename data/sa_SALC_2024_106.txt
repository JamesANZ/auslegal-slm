[2024] SALC
LICENSING COURT OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA
SONS OF THE
SOUTHERN CROSS ADELAIDE SOUTH INCORPORATED
Application for Review of a decision of the
Commissioner
LC-24-00082
HEARING DATE:
23 May and 20 June 2024
JUDGMENT OF:
His Honour Judge BP Gilchrist
DELIVERED ON:
REPRESENTATION:
Applicant: Mr
Intervenor: Acting Sergeant M
Solicitors:
Applicant: Wallmans
Intervenor: Commissioner of Police
is an application for review in connection with the decision of a delegate of
the Liquor and Gambling Commissioner to effectively
revoke a club licence that
had been granted on an interim basis, to the applicant, Sons of the Southern
Cross Adelaide South Incorporated,
in connection with premises at Aldenhoven
Road, Lonsdale.
licence was granted on an interim basis for twelve months, because the delegate
shared concerns, expressed by South Australian
Police, about the
applicant’s possible relationship with the Hells Angels, an outlawed
motorcycle gang. This concern arose
out of information indicating that some of
the applicant’s members were seen in the presence of members of the Hells
at the Ponde Festival and at other public places. An allied, but perhaps
less significant concern, related to some historical convictions
held by some
members of the applicant’s committee.
licence contained conditions requiring the applicant to endeavour to ensure that
that no entry would be permitted to person wearing
paraphernalia or tattoos
associated with declared criminal organisations, including outlawed motorcycle
gangs, or persons identified
by police as being members or associates of such
organisations and gangs.
grant of the interim licence was subject to the police being given liberty to
apply, which was exercised, and which led to the
revocation of the licence.
police placed information before the delegate that some of the applicant’s
members had been seen in the presence of members
of the Hells Angels and that
some had seen in the company of a member of the Finks motorcycle gang, which is
also outlawed.
delegate invited submissions from the applicant.
applicant advised that the Southern Cross Motorcycle Club has nine chapters
throughout Australia and each chapter runs independently
of each other. It
submitted that the persons said to be in the presence of members of the Hells
Angels and in the company of a member
of the Finks, were not members of the
South Australian chapter. It advised that it was committed to running the
licensed venue in
a professional manner and in accordance with the conditions of
the licence.
would appear that following receipt of the applicant’s submissions, the
delegate compared the Rules registered with the Corporate
Affairs Commission of
South Australia, for the Sons of the Southern Cross Adelaide North Incorporated,
and the Sons of the Southern
Cross South Incorporated. The delegate noted that
the stated objective and purpose of both incorporated entities were the same.
led the delegate to conclude that both were affiliated and closely
associated with each other. The delegate then appears to have
inference that all chapters of the Southern Cross Motorcycle Club were
affiliated and closely associated.
a result, the delegate found that the applicant was not a fit and proper person
for the purposes of the
Liquor Licensing Act 1997
gravamen of the applicant’s complaint on review was that the
delegate’s response to the information provided by police
disproportionate. Allied to this was a complaint of a denial of procedural
fairness in respect of the delegate’s finding
that Sons of the Southern
Cross Adelaide North Incorporated and the Sons of the Southern Cross South
Incorporated were affiliated
and closely associated with each other.
matter was dealt with by this Court by way of mediation. Although mediation is
not expressly provided for by the Act,
of the Act requires the
Court to act without undue formality, and
enables it to inform
itself on any matter as it thinks fit. These provisions give the Court broad
powers that are sufficient for
it to attempt to resolve matters before it
through mediation and, provided it is with the consent of the parties, to rely
upon information
provided to it in a mediation to make findings to support any
orders that it might make.
the course of the mediation, I expressed concern that there might be an issue
with the delegate’s finding that Sons of the
Southern Cross Adelaide North
Incorporated and the Sons of the Southern Cross South Incorporated were
affiliated and closely associated
with each other. I was not sure that it
followed that because they shared the same stated objective and purpose, that
that finding
necessarily followed. I also thought that there might be something
in the submission that the applicant was entitled to be heard
potential finding.
the mediation, I was made privy to information that the police seemed to accept
as possibly true, that the applicant has no
interest in associating with
outlawed motorcycle gangs and it remains committed to complying with the
conditions of the licence.
To demonstrate this the applicant indicated a
willingness to spell this out further in the conditions of the licence and to be
to ongoing supervision from the Court for the extended period of two
years. It seemed to me that this was a more appropriate and
proportionate
response to the information that had been provided by police to the delegate,
and the police agreed.
a result, with the consent of the parties, and with the imprimatur of the Court,
the following orders were made:
By consent, the application for review is allowed and the decision of the
Commissioner to revoke the licence and related approvals
is set aside and in
lieu thereof I order as follows:
licence and related approvals are approved on an interim basis for a period of 2
years from today with the police having liberty
to apply. If there is no
application made by the police during that period at the end of it the approvals
will be made on an ongoing
conditions of the licence are varied to include the following:
The licensee will ensure that no person is knowingly allowed entry to, or
permitted to remain on, the licensed premises that is:-
wearing clothing, jewellery or accessories which area associated with declared
criminal organisations (including outlaw
motorcycle gangs);

outlaw motorcycle gangs);
identified by a Police Officer as being a member or associate of a declared
criminal organisation (including outlaw motorcycle
