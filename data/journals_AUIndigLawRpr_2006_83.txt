Introduction
Government Management of Aboriginal Trust Money in New
South Wales:
‘Eventually they get it all…’
Sean Brennan and Zoe Craven
Indigenous Law Centre Research Report
September 2006
For much of the 20th Century the NSW Government took money belonging to
Aboriginal people and placed it in trust accounts for which
it was legally
responsible. It then resisted people who sought to have their own money returned
to them, knowing that official records
were poor and that significant amounts
had gone astray within the bureaucracy.
Legislation in NSW gave State officials the capacity to control wages earned
by children who were forced to work as ‘apprentices’,
control over some early welfare payments made to Aboriginal adults. As the 20th
Century advanced, Commonwealth laws gave
the same officials power over a broader
range of social security entitlements, such as child endowment and maternity
allowances.
This was part of a wider set of controls that could be, and often
were, exercised over Aboriginal people’s movement, labour
and land. These
controls were mainly exercised through the Aborigines Protection Board (later
the Aborigines Welfare Board). Most
Aboriginal people lived their lives
independently of the Board, but many were caught in its net. When that happened,
these controls
often had lasting consequences in terms of health and
This research report focuses on the laws that made government control of
Aboriginal people’s money possible. In that sense,
it tells only a small
and technical part of the story. It is the voices of Aboriginal people –
those who experienced these
controls over their labour and money, those who
resisted them and those who lived independently of the Board – that convey
what these times were really like for those who lived through them.
A Long Campaign Finally Leads to Government
In February 2004 a story in the
National Indigenous Times
revealed the existence of a draft Cabinet Minute from the NSW Department of
Community Services (DoCS). The minute was called
‘Aboriginal Trust Funds
Payback Scheme Proposal’ and was dated April 2001. Reportedly it urged the
NSW Government to
adopt a scheme for repaying wages and entitlements owing to
Aboriginal people that had been placed in government trust accounts between
It appears the draft minute was headed off within the
bureaucracy before it reached Cabinet. The NIT story appeared in 2004, but
story of Aboriginal people in NSW and their experiences with the Board had begun
decades earlier.
From the early 20th Century, apprentices had fought to have their money
released from Board trust accounts, to spend it on things
that other people were
free to purchase at their own discretion. Community leaders had campaigned
against Board maladministration
on stations and reserves, and against workplace
discrimination and abuse. After the Board was abolished in 1969, Aboriginal
had lobbied successive State governments for money held in government
trust accounts to be returned to its rightful owners. Across
the border in
Queensland, through the 1990s and into the new century, the campaign against
missing, unpaid and underpaid wages had
increasingly gained statewide and
national attention.
By the late 1990s, the Department of Community Services (DoCS) – in
many respects the bureaucratic successor to the Board –
had developed to
an advanced stage a proposed repayment scheme. Other parts of the NSW
Government, however, maintained a hardline
stance, resisting calls for
repayment. In the leaked draft Cabinet Minute from 2001, the DoCS Minister, Faye
Lo Po, reportedly wrote
that ‘[f]rom 1970 until now, the unwritten policy
of DoCS and Treasury appears to have been to resist reimbursement of these
A month after the NIT story, the NSW Premier himself moved to end the decades
of official resistance to repayment. On 11 March 2004
in Parliament, Bob Carr
acknowledged that Aboriginal people had been forced to pay money into trust
accounts and that successive
NSW governments had ‘failed that
On 5 May 2004, Premier Carr announced the formation of a panel to finalise
design of a repayment scheme. The panel had two Indigenous
members, and was
chaired by the former Director-General of the National Parks and Wildlife
In December 2004 the NSW Government released the panel’s report. It
recommended the establishment of the NSW Aboriginal Trust
Fund Repayment Scheme
(ATFRS), administratively linked to the Premier’s Department, with
dedicated support from archivists
to assist with record searches. It also called
for a new three-person ATFRS Panel to be formed, comprised entirely of respected
people or at least with an Aboriginal majority and chair. The report
said that the scheme should:

Introduction
Controls over the wages and entitlements of many Aboriginal people in NSW
were largely exercised through a government-appointed authority,
the Aborigines
Protection Board (re-named in 1940 the Aborigines Welfare Board). In 1883, the
NSW Government established the Aborigines
Protection Board (referred to here as
the APB, later the AWB, or generically as the Board). Its powers were secured
and extended
Aborigines Protection Act
1909 (NSW). The Board was
given a number of statutory duties by the 1909 Act, including to ‘exercise
a general supervision and
care over all matters affecting the interests and
welfare of aborigines’, to manage and regulate reserves and Stations upon
which Aboriginal people resided and to provide for the custody, maintenance and
education of Aboriginal children. Additionally, and
ironically, the Board was
‘to protect [aborigines] against injustice, imposition, and
It was through the Board that the wages and entitlements of Aboriginal people
were diverted into government trust accounts and in
an unknown number of cases,
never returned to their legal owners.
Typically the Board might supply rations and blankets to Aboriginal people on
a reserve, through local police, but government administration
of reserve land
was otherwise minimal. As well as rations, there was, at least officially, some
schooling and provision of health
services on Aboriginal Stations. Usually the
Board put a married non-Aboriginal couple in charge as manager-teacher and
matron respectively,
but the NSW Public Service Board reported in 1938 that the
appointment of properly qualified people to the job was a ‘rare
occurrence’.
Historian Heather Goodall says that in these early decades of the 20th
Century no more than 15% of the Aboriginal population was under
the managerial
control of the Board – the rest were leading independent
With the Great Depression the proportion under direct Board
supervision increased to over 30 per cent and ‘many more were on
under the surveillance of the police’.
The Board was abolished and the Aborigines Protection Act 1909 (NSW) repealed
During its life, the Board diverted a wide range of moneys owing to
Aboriginal people into trust accounts. This report begins with
the Board’s
control over the wages of children forced to work as apprentices, mainly in
domestic or agricultural labour. It
then looks at a variety of social security
entitlements that were introduced and then amended over the course of the 20th
In a number of instances, the evidence discussed here shows these
entitlements actually being diverted into Board accounts. For the
completeness, we have described all the major social security benefits available
in the period 1900-1969 and noted, where
relevant, the legal
for diversion of these moneys to the Board. This is because our own research in
NSW does not purport to be exhaustive and therefore
actual diversion may have
occurred in respect of benefits not revealed by our research. In addition, from
a national point of view,
the information may be useful to researchers in other
diversion of particular benefits. Three other issues relating to Aboriginal
labour and monetary entitlements are then briefly dealt
with, before the report
turns to the Board’s accounting and accountability obligations and the
question of record-keeping.
