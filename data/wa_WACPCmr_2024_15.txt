reviewed all evidence. Only the evidence relevant to deciding this application
is mentioned
in these reasons for decision.
Would keeping the pet
exceed a reasonable number of pets being kept at the premises?
application to Consumer Protection, the landlord raised concern that it would be
unreasonable to keep any additional pets
at the premises, as the tenant already
has the existing approved pets at the premises.
When considering what is
a ‘reasonable number of pets’, I have considered:
The nature and
size of the premises.
The requested
Any existing
pets at the premises.
Applicable Local
Government laws.
In a written submission to Consumer Protection,
the tenants advised the premises are 728 square metres, with the backyard taking
just under half of the total area.
The tenants also provided photos
of the backyard of the premises, which shows there is enough space for the
requested pet and the
existing approved pets to co-exist.
The premises
are located in [redacted], which allows residents to keep up to two dogs and
three cats.
The landlord has not presented any evidence that suggests
the addition of the requested pet would exceed a ‘reasonable number
pets’ at the premises.
For these reasons, I am not satisfied that
keeping the requested pet would exceed a reasonable number of pets being kept at
the premises.
Is the premises unsuitable for keeping the
The RTA provides examples of why a premises may be unsuitable, such
as a lack of fencing and open spaces.
In their application to Consumer
Protection, the landlord claimed, “the size of the rear yard is not
reasonable for the keeping
of two dogs”.
The tenants’
evidence about the size of the property, as well as their photos of the
backyard, demonstrate there is enough open
space for the requested pet and the
existing approved pets. The tenants’ photos also show the backyard is
fully fenced.
No evidence has been provided by the landlord to show the
premises are unsuitable for keeping the requested pet.
Considering the
information from the landlord and the tenant, I am not satisfied that the
premises are unsuitable for keeping the
