REASONS FOR
(Revised from the transcript)
, the plaintiff, became a director and
shareholder of
Pty Ltd, together with its then-existing
directors and shareholders,
defendants, who are brother and sister. Hillcrest was incorporated under the
Companies Act 1985
(NI). From 1996 until 21 November 2012, Hillcrest
owned four parcels of
on Norfolk Island on which it conducted the
of a licensed hotel under the names “Hillcrest
Hotel” or “Hillcrest Bed & Breakfast” using numerous
on the land. Hillcrest also acquired various items of plant and
equipment for use in the business (the
). Hillcrest had granted a
mortgage to
Banking Corporation over the land to secure a loan of
$1.2 million.
the six years from March 2002, Mr Prechelt managed the business as lessee
from Hillcrest and caused the Westpac mortgage to
be reduced by over $452,000.
The significance of this was that on 9 April 2003, Mr Douran entered into
an agreement (the
share purchase agreement
) with Mr Prechelt that
acknowledged the earlier sale to Mr Prechelt for $300,000 of his initial
holding of 300 shares and promised
that Mr Douran would transfer to Mr
(a) up to 1,200 more shares in tranches of 100 on payment of each $100,000 by
which Mr Prechelt reduced the $1.2 million mortgage
(b) up to a further 1,000 shares in the period until 1 March 2008, in tranches
of 100, on payment to Mr Douran of $100,000 per tranche
(which is not presently
of any significance) subject to Mr Prechelt paying an option fee of 5% of
the value of those 1,000 shares
monthly in arrears over the 5 year period
beginning on 30 April 2003.
October 2012, Mr Douran and Michael
, his business partner in
among other ventures Worldwide Totalisators (NI) Pty Ltd, agreed to form a
company to be incorporated and
own its issued capital in equal shareholdings.
Their plan was to buy land, business and assets (
Hillcrest’s
) from Hillcrest without informing Mr Prechelt by Mr King
funding payment of about $500,000 needed to discharge the mortgage to Westpac
and Mr Douran funding the payment of Hillcrest’s unsecured trade creditors
of about $130,000. At that time, Mr Douran held
2,199 of the 2,500 issued
shares in Hillcrest. Mr Prechelt, who had resigned as a director in 2008,
still held 300 shares and Ms
Douran held 1 share.
29 October 2012, they caused
Heritage Hill
Investments Pty Ltd to be
incorporated and became equal shareholders in it. In Heritage Hill’s
application for finance to
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (
and Mr King signed, Mr Douran valued his own interest in Hillcrest at
$700,000 (Ex E).
20 November 2012, Hillcrest entered into an agreement (the
) to sell the Hillcrest property to Heritage Hill for the price of
$500,000, apportioned so that the purchaser paid $460,000 for the
land, $20,000
for the plant and equipment and $20,000 for the licensed hotel business, being
all of Hillcrest’s assets.
6 June 2013, Mr King obtained a valuation of Hillcrest’s property as
at 22 November 2012 for stamp duty purposes (Vol 4,
tab 3-4). The valuer
assessed the value at $800,000.
the hearing, the expert valuers had conferred and arrived at a small difference
between their two reports. Today, the parties
agreed that the value of the
assets transferred on 22 November 2012 from Hillcrest to Heritage Hill was
$1,087,500. It followed
that the transfer of the Hillcrest property for
$500,000 resulted in Heritage Hill acquiring it at an undervalue of $587,500,
the difference between what was paid and its true value.
Mr Prechelt
brought proceedings in 2016 seeking that Hillcrest be wound up, which
Mr Douran opposed. On 2 June 2017, after a contested
hearing, the Chief
Justice ordered that Hillcrest be wound up and that Mark Pearce and Michael
be appointed its liquidators:
Prechelt; in the matter of
Hillcrest Pty Ltd v Hillcrest Pty Ltd (No 3)
[2017] NFSC 6
Besanko CJ ordered Mr and Ms Douran to pay Mr Prechelt’s
costs of those proceedings on an indemnity basis. Earlier, his
Honour had found
that the facts before him revealed a
prima facie
case of breach of
director’s duties against Mr Douran arising out of the 2012
Prechelt, in the matter of Hillcrest Pty Ltd v Hillcrest Pty Ltd
[2017] NFSC 3
19 November 2018, Mr Prechelt entered into an
with Hillcrest and its liquidators to purchase all claims belonging to Hillcrest
against Mr King, Mr and Ms Douran and
any other party arising out of,
associated or connected with the 2012 agreement, its performance “and
without limitation, a
cause or causes of action for breach of duties of a
director in equity and/or at common law and/or under statute”.
Mr Prechelt
agreed to pay the liquidators $5,500 and 25% of the net
recovery in any such proceeding. It is common ground that the liquidators
entered into the assignment in exercise of their power under s 481(2)(c) of
Mr Prechelt
made various claims in the second amended
statement of claim
which were defended. As a result of counsel sensibly narrowing the issues and
making further refinements of them during
the course of the hearing, two
substantial issues remain to be determined, namely,
Mr Prechelt has any standing to bring the proceeding as an assignee in
respect of any rights under s 285(7) of the Act (the
, whether Mr Prechelt had proven that, but for
Ms Douran’s breaches of her statutory or equitable duties or obligations,
would not have suffered any loss or damage (the
Douran conceded that his conduct involved a breach his fiduciary duty not to act
where his interest and duty conflicted or might
possibly conflict: see
v Duke Group Ltd (in liq)
[2001] HCA 31

and s 285(4) of the Act.
Ms Douran conceded that she had breached her duties under s 285(2) and (4) of
THE LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS
Relevantly,
s 285 of the Act, which reproduced the analogous provisions of s 229
of the since repealed uniform
Companies Codes
of each State and
Territory, provides as follows:
Duty and liability of officers
An officer of a corporation shall at all times act honestly in the
exercise of his powers and the discharge of the duties of his
(a) in a case to which paragraph (b) does not apply - 50 penalty units; or
(b) where the offence was committed with intent to deceive or defraud the
company, members or creditors of the company or creditors
of some other person
or for some other fraudulent purpose - 200 penalty units or imprisonment or
An officer of a corporation shall at all times exercise reasonable
care and diligence in the exercise of his powers and the discharge
Penalty: 50 penalty units.
An officer or employee of a corporation shall not make improper use
of his position as such an officer or employee to gain, directly
or indirectly,
an advantage for himself or for some other person or to cause detriment to the
corporation.
Penalty: 20 penalty units or imprisonment or both.
Where a person contravenes or fails to comply with a provision of
this section in relation to a corporation,
the corporation may
or not the person has been convicted of an offence under this section in
relation to that contravention or failure,
recover from the person as a debt

(a) if that person or some other person made a profit as a result of the
contravention or failure - an amount equal to the amount
of that profit; and
(b) if the corporation has suffered loss or damage as a result of the
contravention or failure - an amount equal to the amount of
that loss or damage.
This section has effect in addition to, and does not affect the
operation of, any rule of law relating to the duty or liability
of a person by
reason of his office or employment in relation to a corporation and does not
prevent the institution of a civil proceeding
in respect of a breach of such a
duty or in respect of such a liability.
(emphasis added)
Relevantly,
s 481 conferred the following powers on a liquidator:
The liquidator may —
(a) bring or defend a legal proceeding in the name and on behalf of the
(c) sell or otherwise dispose of, in any manner, all or any part of the
property of the company;
(j) do such other things as are necessary for winding up the affairs of the
company and distributing its property.
Mercantile Law (Chose in Action) Act 1989
(NI) provided, analogously to
Judicature Act
provisions such as
Conveyancing Act
Legal assignments of debts and other choses in action
A debt or other chose in action may be assigned by a written
assignment signed by the assignor or by the assignor’s agent.
Subject to subsection (3), and to equities that have priority
over the rights of the assignee, an assignment under subsection (1)
is effective
to pass to the assignee —
(a) the legal right to the debt or chose in action;
(b) all legal and other
remedies in respect of the debt or chose in action; and
(c) the power to give a good discharge for the debt or chose in action
without the concurrence of the
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
is necessary to say something more about the factual background. During the
period between March 2002 and March 2008, Mr Prechelt
managed the hotel
business under a lease from Hillcrest. He caused the mortgage to Westpac to be
reduced by over $452,000. However,
he appears to have ceased paying the monthly
instalments of the option fee under the share purchase agreement in around June
That led to a discussion, which it is not currently necessary to resolve,
as to the proper construction of the share purchase agreement
provision relating
to the option fee for any tranche of shares, including as to when Mr
Prechelt’s entitlement arose and what
was due by him.
March 2008, Mr Prechelt appears to have had enough and wished to conclude
his management of the hotel business and the conduct
of the lease. At the time
he left, he had yet to complete some of the bookkeeping and records. He
accepted, in his evidence, that
he intended to return whatever relevant
documents he had in that regard completed to the time that he finished in his
position, but he failed to do so, despite numerous promises. He has
not now been able to recover the books. However, he gave unchallenged
that he left all of the ordinary accounting books and records, such as bank
statements and documents recording the day-to-day
transactions, in the hotel
office when he left in 2008. For whatever reason, the books and records of the
business after Mr Prechelt
left do appear to have been sufficient to enable the
preparation of statutory accounts for the 2007–2008 financial year.
no statutory accounts appear to have been created for some period by
Mr Douran or whoever was responsible for that task. Although
there was a
deal of evidence on the topic, nothing turns on it.
31 July 2009, Hillcrest owed about $654,000 under the Westpac mortgage.
Mr Douran contended that for a considerable period after
Prechelt’s departure he had to provide financial support to keep the
business running and Hillcrest solvent. Mr Douran
claimed that by 2012 he had
arrived at the point where he was no longer prepared to continue to do so. That
claim makes no sense
to me because of what he did thereafter.
The events leading to the 2012 agreement
mid-October 2012, Mr King and Mr Douran decided that they would cause
their new company, Heritage Hill, to acquire Hillcrest’s
property and then
continue to run what, according to Mr Douran, had been an unprofitable business
that he had had to keep afloat
by his own contributions and was no longer
prepared to do so. As I have said, that asserted rationale makes no commercial
Far less is it consistent with his and Mr King’s subsequent
actions in stripping Hillcrest of its assets in secret from Mr
Prechelt so
that the latter would receive no benefit as a shareholder from the realisation
of those assets. The result was that
Mr Prechelt would receive nothing from his
contributions to the reduction of the Westpac mortgage or earlier conduct of the
in circumstances where the sale was, even from Mr Douran’s
contemporaneous perspective, at an undervalue.
Mr Dullaway’s
affidavit disclosed documents on the file of Willis & Bowring solicitors in
Miranda, New South Wales, including
shareholders agreement
November 2012 in respect of Heritage Hill between Mr King and
Mr Douran and the 2012 agreement. Don
of Willis &
Bowring prepared those agreements. Mr Wright, properly, informed
Mr King and Mr Douran that, without fully informed
consent of each of
them, he could not act for all parties in the transactions. After they gave
their consent on behalf of Hillcrest,
Heritage Hill and each individual
personally, Mr Wright prepared a brief setting out his understanding of what was
proposed and sent
it to both Mr Douran and Mr King to consider.
a meeting held on 15 October 2012, at which Mr King, Mr Douran and
Mr Wright were present, Mr King and Mr Douran instructed
Wright that Mr Prechelt had a “share option agreement”
in the latter’s favour (namely the share purchase agreement)
“broke”. They told Mr Wright that Mr Prechelt was not
involved in any way in the current proposal. One of
the concerns which
Mr Wright recorded in his file note related to the distribution of the
proceeds of sale. At that time and thereafter,
the proposal was that
Mr King would inject $600,000 into Heritage Hill, $500,000 of which would
be used to pay out the Westpac mortgage
with the balance to be used to pay any
stamp duty and provide working capital. Mr Douran would pay out the
existing trade creditors
of Hillcrest so that there would be no external or
other creditors, apart from whatever claim he had for his provision of his
shareholder
loans and a small sum owed to Mr Prechelt. The plan was that
after two years or so, Mr King would forgive $500,000 of his capital
injection. The equal shareholding both men were to have in Heritage Hill no
doubt reflected, in effect, their then equal provision
of about $100,000 each,
in working capital and payment of Hillcrest’s external creditors, after
taking in account the forgiveness
of the $500,000 mortgage payment and
Mr Douran’s having brought to his side of the Heritage Hill venture
all of Hillcrest’s
property that it sold at what is now an agreed
undervalue.
5 November 2012, Mr Wright wrote to Mr Douran and Mr King referring to their
discussion on 15 October 2012 and his email exchange
with Mr King on 21
October 2012 as “the way to go. The principal reason for saying so is
that it avoids
the Prechelt complications which would arise if the company
, rather than its assets” (emphasis added). He then recited
the essential elements of the arrangements which came to be reflected
shareholders agreement between Mr King and Mr Douran. In cl 3.8
Mr King declared that his present intention was, at the expiration
years from the date of the agreement, to forgive “so much of the advance
as constitutes $500,000 and that thereupon
so much of the advance as exceeds
that sum shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions” of the
shareholders agreement.
continued to assist in the preparation of the documentation to effect the sale
and shareholders agreement. He prepared
a draft resolution of directors of
Hillcrest for Mr and Ms Douran’s signature to record
Hillcrest’s entry into the 2012
agreement for a consideration of $500,000.
In his letter of 21 November 2012 to Mr Douran and Mr King, Mr Wright
noted that Mr and
Ms Douran were to sign and date the minute and keep the
original with Hillcrest’s records, providing a copy to Heritage Hill.
least so far as the liquidators are concerned, no original of any signed minute
was kept in Hillcrest’s records and none
is in evidence.
who is 92 years old, said in her evidence that she accepted that her memory was
not good. She said that she signed the
documents but did not recall having any
discussions with Mr King or learning that he and her brother were the
directors and shareholders
of Heritage Hill, saying: “I don’t recall
ever being there or ever concerned about that” and gave the following
Do you recall your brother Kerry Douran approaching you about selling Hillcrest
to Mr King? --- Yes. He was trying to sell Hillcrest,
but I knew after the
sale that they had spoken
and they had spoken about selling Hillcrest, but I
wasn’t there, so I don’t know.
asked her about what she had referred to in saying that she knew after the sale,
and she said:
when I was asked to sign, I think, the land content or something, I signed the
land content, and then I knew, and then the sale went

had no part in the running of Hillcrest nor did I know how they ran
but you do seem to recall Kerry Douran telling you something about selling the
Hillcrest assets with respect to Mike King. You recall
something about that,
don’t you? ---
Well, he was in trouble financially, and I was prepared
for him to do what he had to do to get out of trouble
, but I wasn’t
part of any deals, and I don’t know what happened there.
I made no inquiries at all. ... I didn’t want to know or be involved.
repeated that she knew nothing about what was going on at Hillcrest, did not
want to be involved, her brother had told her that
he was in trouble financially
and would be trying to sell Hillcrest.
Mr and Ms Douran’s admissions of contravening s 285(2)
those circumstances, it is clear why Ms Douran accepted that she had
breached her duties under s 285(2) of the
Companies Act
because she did not take any action which a reasonable person in her position,
acting as a director of Hillcrest, would
have taken to find out what the
transaction was, who the parties to it were, what the price was, what
negotiations or steps had been
taken to seek to achieve a proper price or
whether her brother had any interest in the purchaser. Likewise there was a
solid basis
for her to concede that she had contravened s 285(4), given
that she said that she had executed the documents because “I was
for him [Mr Douran] to do what he had to do to get out of trouble”. That
conduct contravened her obligation not to
use her position as an officer of
Hillcrest in order to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for some other
person, being her
brother: see
Chew v The Queen
[1992] HCA 18
(1992) 173 CLR 626
632‑–633 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, who held that
the word “to”, in s 229(4) of the
Companies (Western
Australia) Code
, the exact analogue of s 285(4), meant “in order
position with Mr Douran was more pellucid still. He knew that he was
effecting the sale of Hillcrest’s property at a gross
undervalue. Even on
his own account, he valued his interest in Hillcrest at $700,000, in
circumstances where he held almost 88%
of the shares and Mr Prechelt the
remaining 12%. Thus the value of Hillcrest’s assets being sold for
$500,000, if one included
Mr Prechelt’s interest, was in his mind even
greater than the $700,000.
was no explanation in any of Mr Douran’s evidence as to the
commerciality behind why he and Mr King caused the transfer
of the whole of
Hillcrest’s property, including a business that Mr Douran claimed had been
so loss-making, for the price they
set, namely, the amount outstanding to
Westpac under the mortgage, as opposed to setting a proper price for it. They
then planned,
through Heritage Hill, to run the same business, with exactly the
same amount of debt of $500,000 albeit that it would be forgiven.
The effect of
the agreement and the transaction as a whole was that Mr Douran and Mr King,
through Heritage Hill, would hold the
whole of the transferred assets without
having to account to Hillcrest for their true value. That was calculatedly
dishonest. Mr
Douran’s conduct reflected the dishonesty.
the transaction was in its final stages Mr Prechelt appears to have got
wind that something was going on, and he emailed Mr
Douran on 15 November 2012,
asking: “What is news on the Hillcrest, I hear that Mike King has bought
On 17 November 2012, Mr Douran emailed back:
Hey Gregg, dont believe whatm [sic] you hear.
Subsequently,
Mr Prechelt persisted in his attempts to discover what was going on in
Hillcrest. Finally, Mr Douran arranged for accounts
30 June 2013 to be presented to an annual general meeting of Hillcrest on
24 June 2014. On 24 June 2014, Mr and Ms Douran
signed a directors report
for the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2013 which stated under the heading
“Directors Benefits”:
No directors have received a benefit by reason of a contract made with the
company or related corporation.
was not true to Mr Douran’s knowledge. He had made a contract to sell
Hillcrest’s property, at an undervalue, to
Heritage Hill, a company in
which he knew he had a 50% shareholding. The minutes of the meeting held on 24
June 2014 recorded that
Mr Douran, as chairman, moved in accordance with a
motion on the agenda that steps be taken as soon as practicable to wind up
Hillcrest’s
affairs. That motion was passed unanimously. The transcript
of Mr Douran’s tape recording of the meeting revealed that Mr
stated that he wanted to have a liquidator appointed to investigate what had
happened in the company’s affairs, as
Mr Douran understood.
19 January 2015, Mr Prechelt wrote a letter to the Chief Minister of Norfolk
Island, the Registrar of Companies, Mr King, Mr and
Ms Douran. He referred
to the sale by Hillcrest to Heritage Hill that Hillcrest had recorded as being
at the directors’ valuation,
without them ever having obtained an
independent valuation. He noted that the Land Titles Office had recorded that a
valuation (for
stamp duty purposes) had assessed the land and assets being sold
as valued at $800,000, and that Mr Douran was interested on both
sides of the
transaction as a director of both Hillcrest and Heritage Hill and a 50%
shareholder in the latter. Mr Prechelt suggested
that what had occurred
was unlawful and ought to be investigated.
the meantime, Mr Douran had done nothing about progressing with the
appointment of a liquidator. That was the last thing Mr Douran
occur. He decided to take another course and sought to have Hillcrest
deregistered. On 18 February 2015, he made a statutory
declaration seeking
Hillcrest’s deregistration under the

certified that it had no assets and:
The members have lost all interest in [the affairs of the company] and

admitted in cross-examination, when pressed, that this was not true. The
obvious purpose of Mr Douran’s action in seeking
deregistration, as
also reflected in his opposition to Mr Prechelt’s 2016 proceeding,
was to prevent a liquidator investigating
what he and Mr King had done in
causing Heritage Hill to acquire Hillcrest’s property at a gross
undervalue. As the Chief
Justice recorded in his reasons, based on the evidence
then before him, there was a
prima facie
case of a breach of duty. That
case has been established as fact in the evidence before me.
Importantly,
Mr Douran admitted in cross-examination that there was no urgency in seeking to
bring about the sale by Hillcrest to
Heritage Hill in late 2012, creditors were
not pressing and Westpac had not called up the mortgage. He made a desultory
to say that Hillcrest’s property was on the market listed with
real estate agents and available for sale. But there was no
independent
evidence that this position existed at any time during 2012, and in particular,
once he and Mr King had hatched the plan
to use Mr Wright’s firm in
mid-October 2012 to bring about the sale at the time it occurred, a little over
a month later.
It may well be that there had been earlier attempts, both by
Mr Prechelt and Mr Douran, to interest others in a sale in 2008, and
perhaps earlier, to Phillip Hooper, which came to nought.
obvious commercial purpose of the structuring of the sale was to strip Hillcrest
of its assets at an undervalue and to prevent
Mr Prechelt receiving any
benefit from those assets as a shareholder or member were the company to be

is no other evidence that Ms Douran knew of or was involved in the plan between
Mr King and Mr Douran other than what Mr Douran
said purportedly on her
behalf. It was not put to her that she had given him authority to say that.
That affidavit gave no further
description of any involvement of Ms Douran,
and I do not need to make any further findings about her involvement.
MR AND MS DOURAN’S SUBMISSIONS
these proceedings, Mr Douran and his sister have maintained a number of
unmaintainable defences that have gradually fallen
and Ms Douran argued that the cause of action in debt under s 285(7) was
not assignable, in spite of the ordinary principle that
a liquidator can assign
a company’s causes of action under analogues of s 481(2)(c). They
contended that, because of its nature,
the cause of action under s 285(7)
was not assignable. They submitted that the provision was in the nature of
analogues of certain
statutory compensation provisions, such as are found in
s 236 of the
Australian Consumer Law
in Sch 2 of the
Competition
and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth) and its predecessor,
Practices Act 1974
(Cth). They noted that there is a debate in the
authorities as to whether
Corporations Act 2001
(Cth) allows for the assignment of a cause of action by a liquidator, given
that some decisions have held it is assignable and others
that it is not.

THE ASSIGNMENT ISSUE
and Ms Douran accepted the validity of the assignment to Mr Prechelt of
Hillcrest’s causes of action in equity and at common
law for their
breaches of fiduciary duty and of their equitable duty owed to Hillcrest to
exercise reasonable skill and care when
acting in a fiduciary capacity (see

following principles applied to the situation in which Mr and Ms Douran acted as
Hillcrest’s directors in entering into
and completing, on its behalf, the
2012 agreement and the transfer of Hillcrest’s property to Heritage Hill
at an undervalue.
Furs Ltd v Tomkies
[1936] HCA 3
(1936) 54 CLR 583
at 592–593, Rich, Dixon and
Evatt JJ identified the inflexible rule of equity that:
... except under the authority of a provision in the articles of association,
no director shall obtain for himself a profit by means of a transaction to
which he is concerned on behalf of the company unless all
the material facts are
disclosed to the shareholders and by resolution a general meeting approves of
his doing so, or all shareholders
An undisclosed profit which a
director so derives from the execution of his fiduciary duties belongs in equity
to the company.
It is no answer to the application of the rule that the
profit is of a kind which the company could not itself have obtained, or that
loss is caused to the company by the gain of the director. It is a principle
resting upon the impossibility of allowing the conflict
of duty and interest
which is involved in the pursuit of private advantage in the course of dealing
in a fiduciary capacity with
the affairs of the company. If, when it is his
duty to safeguard and further the interests of the company, he uses the occasion
as a means of profit to himself, he raises an opposition between the duty he has
undertaken and his own self interest, beyond which
it is neither wise nor
practicable for the law to look for a criterion of liability. The consequences
of such a conflict are not
discoverable. Both justice and policy are against
their investigation.
With reference to a transaction arising out of another
relation of confidence, Lord
said: “The general interests of
justice” require “it to be destroyed in every instance; as no Court
is equal to
the examination and ascertainment of the truth in much the greater
number of cases” (
Ex parte James
[1803] EngR 536
[1803] EngR 536
at p 388)). His language has been applied to, and illustrated by, the case
of a fiduciary agent making undisclosed profits (
Panama and South Pacific
Telegraph Co v India Rubber Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Co
10 Ch 515, at pp 523, 527)).
(emphasis added)
principles have applied, despite changes in corporate statute laws, to the need
for a director or officiant to make a full
and frank disclosure of, and receive
fully informed consent for, any transaction that he or she makes with, or
causes, to be made
by a company where he or she has a real and sensible
possibility of a conflict of interest and or duties:

Fiduciaries, such as directors, are bound by strict rules for good reason,
because, as Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron
International Ltd v Dwyer
[1995] HCA 18

“fiduciaries generally conduct themselves ‘at a level higher than

from being swayed by considerations of personal interest
and from accordingly
misusing the fiduciary position for personal advantage (

Thus, it is no defence that the
plaintiff was unwilling, unlikely or unable to make the profits for which an
account is taken or that

If, pursuant to the constitution of a corporation and the manner in which its
business is conducted, a director has an authority
to execute an instrument so
as to bind the company but that authority is conditioned on the approval or
concurrence of all or some
other directors, it is improper to purport to
exercise that authority without that approval or concurrence.
Where prior
authority is required for the execution of an instrument, the person executing
the instrument may knowingly fail to obtain
the authority for any of a number of
reasons: that person may fail to seek the authority or the authority may be
given by directors
who, to the knowledge of the alleged offender, cannot
effectively give the authority required (for example, where their powers are
sterilised by a conflict of interests or duties), or where
the authority,
for some other reason known to the alleged offender, has not been effectively
given by the person or persons empowered
to give it.
In any of these cases,
the person executing the instrument, whether a director or officer, is guilty of
impropriety

bound by the instrument nor whether a third party would be entitled

Such an action must have the character of the old common law
causes of action of
indebitatus assumpsit
. The common law allowed a plaintiff to
sue on common money counts. In lecture V in F W Maitland,
Forms of Action at Common Law
(A H Chaytor and W J Whittaker (eds),
Cambridge University Press, 1981) p 52, Professor Maitland said that “the
action of debt
is not necessarily based on contract – it serves for the
recovery of statutory penalties
, of forfeiture under by-laws, of
amercements, and
of monies adjudged by a court to be due
” (emphasis
added). In lecture VI, Professor Maitland explained (pp 56–57) how
the cause of action in
indebitatus assumpsit
developed. It was based on
an implied promise in an executory contract that the defendant had agreed to pay
money or deliver something.
the mid-19th century, the common law permitted an assignee of a debt to sue, by
a convoluted process, to recover the debt: see
Bullen & Leake: Precedents
of Pleadings in Personal Actions in the Superior Courts of Common Law
ed, V & R Stevens, Sons, and Haynes, 1863) pp 60–65.
the enactment of s 25(6) of the
Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873
(and now s 2 of the
Mercantile Law (Choses in Action)
) there is a simple process to assign a debt or other chose in action
under the statutory procedure. The statutory debt is in contrast
to the rights
under s 236 of the
Australian Consumer Law
and its analogues or
Corporations Act
, each of which creates a right to
recover compensation, not a debt. Thus,

so that a corporation can recover
the amount of loss or damage, being a sum certain, albeit it may be necessary

of s 285. Here, the amount of loss or damage is a sum certain, being the
undervalue of $587,500.
Re Movitor Pty Limited (receiver and manager appointed) (in liq); ex parte
(1996) 136 ALR 643
, Drummond J held that a liquidator could assign a
company’s cause of action to recover the statutory debts created by
and 588W(1) of the then
Corporations Law
(Cth). The loss
or damage was that resulting from insolvent trading. Relevantly, s 588M(2)
The company’s liquidator may recover from the director, as a debt due to
the company, an amount equal to the amount of the
loss or damage.
similar right was created for a liquidator under s 558W where a holding
company had caused a subsidiary to engage in the insolvent
trading. Drummond J
held (at 653–654):
The subject matter of the litigation the subject of the funding arrangement
between the applicant and Lumley is the statutory causes
of action created by
ss 588M and 588W of the Corporations Law.
The right of the liquidator to recover damages created by each of these sections
is described as a right to recover from the director
and the holding company an
amount equal to the loss or damage suffered as a result of the company's
insolvent trading in which the
director and the holding company were implicated
“as a debt due to the company”.
That “debt” arises
once the conditions of liability have been fulfilled, something that must occur
prior to commencement
of any action for recovery under either section. Such a
“debt” can properly be regarded as part of the property of the
company which the liquidator is empowered to sell.

compensation created by ss 588M and 588W are not regarded as true debts but

his classic judgment, with which Dixon CJ agreed in respect of his statement of
the principles, in
Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation
[1963] HCA 21
at 26, Windeyer J said:
Assignment means the immediate transfer of an existing proprietary right, vested
or contingent, from the assignor to the assignee.
Anything that in the eye
of the law can be regarded as an existing subject of ownership, whether it be a
chose in possession or a
chose in action, can today be assigned unless it be
excepted from the general rule on some ground of public policy or by statute.
The common law doctrine that debts and other choses in action were not
assignable never applied to Crown debts, and by the influence
merchant, bills of exchange and promissory notes were outside it. And it was
never accepted in equity. “
Courts of equity from the earliest times
thought the doctrine too absurd for them to adopt

Master v Miller
[1791] EngR 1399
[1791] EngR 1399

already at common law it had been “so explained away that it remains only
an objection
to the form of the action in any case”.
(emphasis added)
statutory language in s 285(7) of the
Companies Act
creates a debt and
Mercantile Law (Chose in Action) Act
makes debts
assignable in Norfolk Island. The natural and ordinary meaning of both
provisions is that the cause of action in debt
created in s 285(7) is assignable
and Ms Douran sought to eschew that consequence by arguing that the purpose
of the statutory use in s 285(7) of the expression
“as a debt due to the
corporation by action in a court of competent jurisdiction” was intended
to ensure that both courts
of Norfolk Island, being this Court and the Court of
Petty Sessions, could entertain actions for recovery within their jurisdictional
limits. This is a court of unlimited jurisdiction and the Court of Petty
Sessions is one of limited jurisdiction.
reject that argument. The purpose of the legislation was to confer on the
liquidator a statutory right to claim the amount of loss
or damage as a debt,
being a sum certain or as ascertained by judgment in the proceeding. No doubt,
the legislature had in mind
that liquidators often are in a position where, in
order to raise funds to carry out their duties and to recover assets of the
as best they can for the benefit of its creditors and shareholders, they
must assign some or all of the insolvent company’s
assets in exercise of
their powers under s 481(2).
ordinary and natural meaning of s 285(7) is apt to create a statutory right
to recover, as a debt, the amount of loss or damage
suffered by the company.
The provision is not intended to create jurisdiction in different courts.
Rather the section creates a
substantive chose in action to recover, as a debt,
a particular class of loss or damage that a company has suffered, caused by a
contravention of another part of s 285. In contrast, a right to statutory
compensation may create a wide discretion in a court as
enactment’s compensatory purpose may be achieved: see, for example, the
discussion by Emmett, Edmonds, and Rares
V-Flow Pty Ltd v Holyoake
Industries (Vic) Pty Ltd
(2013) 296 ALR 418 at 429–431
[53]–[63], being a case dealing with compensation orders under
purpose of the cause of action under s 285(7) is to create a debt, not a
right to have compensation assessed, albeit that the
amount of loss or damage
must be proved so as to be recoverable. It is important to bear in mind that
the purpose of provisions
such as s 481(2)(c) and its analogues is to give
the liquidator of a company statutory power to assign all of its property
that which would not otherwise be assignable under principles of the
common law or equity. In
UTSA Pty Ltd (in liq) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty
(1996) 21 ACSR 457
at 463–464, Hayne JA, with whom Brooking and
Phillips JJA agreed, said of an analogue of s 481(2)(c):
In my view there is no warrant for reading down the general words of the
. The reference to sale or disposal “in any manner” makes
plain that it is the intention of the legislature that the powers
liquidator are to be ample. If a liquidator is to realise the assets of the
company in liquidation to the best advantage,
it would be surprising indeed
if the liquidator were able to sell a particular form of the company’s
assets (its rights of action)
to only a limited class of persons
those who are already interested in the outcome of the action concerned.
Especially is this so when it is to be assumed that
the provisions about
realisation of the company's assets are to be read in light of the long
established rule in relation to bankruptcy
which permits the trustee in
bankruptcy to sell the bankrupt’s rights of action to a third party

In my view nothing turns on the different treatment of
property of the bankrupt and a company in liquidation in the bankruptcy and
companies legislation. In the former case, the property vests in the trustee but
in the latter does not, without special order, vest
in the liquidator.
(emphasis added)
course, there are limits to this power, as Sackville AJA, with whom Giles
and Campbell JJA agreed, held in
The Owners – Strata Plan No 5290
v CGS & Co Pty Ltd
[2011] NSWCA 168
(2011) 81 NSWLR 285
–[65]. There,
Sackville AJA held that the effect of an analogue of s 481(2)(c), namely,
s 477(2)(c)
Corporations Act
, could not override, for
example, a contractual restriction on assignment of a cause of action. That was
because the contract entered
into by the company involved it agreeing not to
assign the cause of action so that it never had a chose in action, as part of
property, that was capable of assignment. The power conferred under
s 481(2)(c)
is to assign the property of the company, not to change the
nature of the property or to create a new right to assign when the company
contracted that the right could not be assigned. In contrast, as Hayne J held
21 ACSR at 463–464, one purpose of the liquidator’s
statutory powers to assign causes of action is to overcome what would
be a breach of public policy reflected in the laws against maintenance and
champerty or other common law or equitable restrictions
on the capacity to
assign property, including choses in action.
that have construed whether or not statutory rights to compensation are
assignable have focused on the true construction of
the relevant statutory right
that is sought to be assigned. It is not necessary, for the reasons I have
given, for me to address
the debate in authorities about the assignability of
the statutory rights to compensation. It is important to bear in mind that
there is an important public policy reflected in the right, that has existed for
well over a century, of a liquidator or trustee
in bankruptcy to assign the
company’s or bankrupt’s property that would not otherwise be
assignable because of a rule
of common law or equity. Those rights include, for
example, a personal cause of action of the bankrupt’s that has vested in
the trustee. The legislation intended to overcome the old rules in the
unwritten law against assignment in the same way that Windeyer
109 CLR at 26 cited Buller J’s judgment in
Master v Miller

the Court of Appeal, following
authority which went back more than a century, held that
even a bare right of
action was property which the trustee was entitled to assign
. His statutory
duty to realise the estate excluded the doctrines of maintenance and champerty
which would otherwise have struck down
such an assignment. Likewise, there is no
rule to prevent him from assigning such a right of action to the bankrupt
himself. So why
should a trustee not assign the right to the net balance?

has more than one cause of action against each of Mr and Ms Douran including for
their breaches of their equitable and fiduciary
duties as its directors for
which they are liable to pay equitable compensation. In my opinion, the
liquidators were entitled to
assign to Mr Prechelt Hillcrest’s rights
, because they were causes of action in debt:
136 ALR at 653–654;
[1996] AC at 258A–B;
ACSR at 463–464. The assignment was valid and enforceable in this
proceeding.
THE CAUSATION ISSUE
second basis on which Ms Douran, but not her brother, opposed the grant of
relief to Mr Prechelt is that, so far as the causes
of action against her
are equitable, she contended that he did not prove that, but for each of her
breaches of duty, Hillcrest would
not have suffered loss. She argued that all
that the evidence had established was that she had failed to do what Mr Prechelt
alleged in the statement of claim, namely, to obtain a valuation of
Hillcrest’s property, to undertake any steps in respect
of the proper
marketing of the property and to prevent Hillcrest entering into the 2012
agreement and transactions giving it effect
in circumstances where,
, she did not give any independent consideration to the interests of
Hillcrest and,
, the 2012 agreement conferred a benefit on
someone else, namely her brother and or Heritage Hill.
may be accepted that Ms Douran did not act dishonestly and was not in a position
of conflict. However, on her own evidence, she
used her position in order to
benefit her brother and or Heritage Hill regardless, in the sense of
recklessness, of any interest
that Hillcrest had in the transaction: cf
Banditt v The Queen
[2005] HCA 80
(2005) 224 CLR 262
at 265–266 [2]–[3],
275 [36] per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ. Her object was to help her
brother (and through him, Heritage
Hill) and nothing else. She put to one side
her duty and loyalty owed to protect Hillcrest’s interests and its assets
they were, or might be, available to meet its debts and to be deployed
in the best interests of its members as a whole, including
Mr Prechelt: cf

is not open on the evidence to accept Ms Douran’s argument to find that
Mr Prechelt failed to prove that Hillcrest would
not have entered into the
transactions but for her conduct. Her participation was an essential part of
the transactions. That can
be seen from what Mr Wright set out in his
letter of 21 November 2012 in his instructions as to how to complete the
disposition of
Hillcrest’s property to Heritage Hill. Ms Douran had
to sign each of the documents, being the 2012 agreement, which she did,
transfers of the land, which she did under the common seal of Hillcrest, along
with her brother. She also should have signed
the minutes of the meeting of
directors, although it does not appear whether she did so. Her signatures on
the 2012 agreements and
the transfer were necessary to ensure that the board of
Hillcrest authorised and caused the transactions to proceed. Without her
participation, they would not have. A different transaction may or may not have
gone ahead, but that is not relevant because her
acts caused, or were a real and
effective cause for, Hillcrest to sell its property at an undervalue.
fiduciary cannot be heard to say that no loss was caused from the use of his or
her position to confer a benefit on another person
in breach of his or her duty
of care owed to, or fiduciary duty not to, confer a benefit on another person at
the expense of, a
cestui que trust
, or, in this case, the company
(Hillcrest). Equity does not permit such an enquiry:
592–593. She must compensate Hillcrest under the stringent rule applying
to directors and fiduciaries for the consequences
of the loss of its property at
the undervalue. But, moreover, her contraventions of both

$587,500. That is a debt due to it by her under

interest, that the liquidators assigned to Mr Prechelt and he can enforce.
DISPOSITION
these reasons, I am of opinion that Mr and Ms Douran must pay Mr Prechelt the
sum of $587,500 plus interest of $323,135 at Court
rates from 22 November
5 October 2022, Mr Prechelt’s solicitors made an offer of compromise
to settle the proceeding for $600,000 inclusive of interest
and costs. That
offer was not accepted. Mr and Ms Douran accept that, as a consequence,
they must pay costs on an indemnity basis
from that time.
Mr Prechelt
seeks indemnity costs from the commencement of the proceeding because there was
no real defence and their defence was
hopeless. In ordering indemnity costs
against Mr Douran in
Prechelt (No 3)
[2017] NFSC 6
Chief Justice said that Mr Douran’s explanation for opposing the order for
Hillcrest’s winding up was implausible
and that the more likely
explanation was that he did not want the November 2012 transaction to be
investigated by a liquidator.
I agree on the fuller evidence before me.
Douran’s resistance to these proceedings has been without merit or legal
foundation. I have found his conduct to have been
dishonest throughout his
dealing with Mr Prechelt in 2012, in relation to Hillcrest and thereafter. He
sought to disguise from Mr
Prechelt the existence of the plan to effect the sale
of Hillcrest’s property in November 2012 and made a false statutory
declaration
in 2015 to have it deregistered, again, to avoid having the light of
day shone on his conduct. He made an affidavit claiming to
speak on his
sister’s behalf from the inception of the winding up proceeding to support
his position.
is clear from Ms Douran’s evidence that there was never any defence to the
2012 agreement being a breach of Mr and Ms Douran’s
directors’ and
fiduciary duties owed to Hillcrest. She believed and intended, as I have found,
only that she needed to do
what was necessary to help her brother regardless of
any interest of Hillcrest.
my opinion, the defence of both Mr and Ms Douran was foredoomed to fail and,
therefore, was an abuse of process of the Court:
Walton v Gardiner
177 CLR 378 at 393 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ.
and Ms Douran must pay the costs of the proceeding on an indemnity basis.
