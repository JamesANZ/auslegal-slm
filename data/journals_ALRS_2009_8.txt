CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION AND DEMOCRACY:
One Voice Or Many?
Charles Evans Hughes’ pithy remark in 1907 that ‘the
Constitution
is what the judges say it
vigorous, and probably never-ending, debate about the tension between the
objective and subjective elements in judicial
law-making. In contested cases of
constitutional interpretation in a multi-member final appellate court, can there
be one ‘right’
view, produced by the objective application of an
external standard, or is the prevailing view merely the accidental consequence
of the aggregation of individual subjective opinion to form a view that happens
to have majority
I am going to leave hanging this large jurisprudential perennial, and devote
this short (IALS-mandated 3-5 page) paper to an intriguing
subset of the
question. Whether the judges are discovering an objective truth or whether the
legal system merely deems it to be so
by giving authoritative effect to the
opinion of the officials charged with the task of resolving disputed
judges speak with one voice or many?
My focus here is not so much on the
permissibility
desirability
dissent, but rather on the question of whether the view of the court, or a
majority of the court, should be expressed in a single
consolidated opinion of
the court, or rather in a multiplicity of individual
The very posing of this question may come as a surprise to my IALS colleagues
at this conference. My impression — though I stand
willing to be corrected
(the opportunity for which is a major benefit of IALS gatherings) — is
that most appellate courts around
the world do not exhibit the latitude for
individual self-expression that has been an enduring feature of the modus
operandi of the
High Court of Australia for over a
practice in Australia has, in some quarters, been a cause for concern. As a
consequence, I am currently engaged with some
ANU colleagues in an empirical
study, commissioned by the National Judicial College of Australia, of what the
consumers of judicial
think of the
relative merits of multiple opinions as against an opinion of the court, or at
least of a majority of the court.
The project was sparked by a concern that multiple opinions in support of a
common outcome are a recipe for uncertainty and lack of
clarity in the law, and
come at a social and economic cost. Yet there are robust arguments on both
sides, and I use this paper to
sketch out those arguments in broad outline,
concluding with some thoughts on where the issue sits in the context of the
theme of constitutional adjudication and democracy.
In favour of the collective opinion
The arguments for a
consolidated opinion of the court, or a majority of the court, are clear enough.
Clarity, and consequently certainty,
are best served, so it is argued, when the
court speaks with one voice. Litigants know where they stand, lower courts know
must follow, lawyers know how to advise their clients, students more
easily know what the law is, and the community has a knowable
framework of laws
within which to go about its business. Moreover, cases can be disposed of more
efficiently, and more cases can
be dealt with in a given time frame. To state
the same argument from the other side, a multitude of ways of stating the same
leaves the law in a state of doubt, delivers a much more onerous task
to those who have to master it, and slows down the whole process
In favour of multiple opinions
On the other hand, there are
powerful arguments in favour of each judge stating his or her view in a
separate, individual opinion.
First, the certainty claimed for a single consolidated opinion is often
illusory. The achievement of agreement amongst powerful individual
minds may require a degree of compromise that glosses over issues perhaps
peripheral to the instant case but of potential
importance to the future
development of the law. Experienced legal advisers sometimes prefer to know the
nuance of individual opinion
in order to better predict the course of future
development, even if that necessitates a greater investment of time and
lawyers may similarly appreciate the richness of the raw material that comprises
the basis of their scholarly analysis and
speculation. (Trial judges, though,
will most likely spurn subtlety and yearn for unvarnished clarity to inform
their rulings and
jury directions and thus render them less vulnerable on
Secondly, the giving of reasons by each individual judge is often seen as the
best assurance that the judge has truly and conscientiously
turned his or her
mind to the question and provided a transparent and examinable justification for
his or her decision. The judicial
oath may even be invoked to demand such
transparency. Collective opinions may be a cover for laziness or even undue
influence; Thomas
Jefferson certainly thought so in 1820 when he described the
United States Supreme Court as ‘huddled up in a conclave’
characterized Chief Justice John Marshall as ‘a crafty Chief
Justice’ who, ‘with the silent acquiescence of
lazy or timid
associates,...sophisticates the law to his own mind by the turn of his own
reasoning’.
In other words, whatever the efficiency gains of collective decision-making, in
the sphere of pronouncements by final appellate courts
the practice may be seen
to threaten the very integrity of the judicial
Thirdly, aficionados of constitutional interpretation well understand the
endemic complexity and subtlety of the task, and the wide
range of principles
and values competing for attention, and will rarely be surprised at the
diversity of opinion this produces. If
these differences are subsumed into
collective opinions, that may distort the world as it really is. We may need to
accept the wisdom
of Oliver Wendell Holmes that ‘certainty generally is
illusion, and repose is not the destiny of
How important are reasons anyway?
Of course, this debate makes a
number of assumptions. First, it assumes that, in the tension between the
competing demands of process
and outcome, between the need for reasons and the
imperative for decision, reasoning and justification have an important role to
societies — especially those in the western common law tradition —
may value this more highly than others. Some
may prioritise execution over
deliberation. I will be interested to discover at this IALS conference to what
extent this tension
is culture-bound, and how it plays out across the range of
decision-making processes, not just in the judicial sphere but also in
legislative and administrative processes and in other facets of public and
private governance.
Variations even within a shared tradition
Secondly, even within the
common law tradition, there is a wide spectrum of ways in which the opinions of
final appellate courts find
expression. Despite Jefferson’s angst about
the dominance of Chief Justice Marshall, pressure of business long ago
in the United States Supreme Court the practice of an opinion of the
court — moderated frequently by separate pluralities and
occasionally by
individual glosses, but with the attention of commentators grabbed mainly by the
strong tradition of dissent —
while in Australia, despite an irregular
pattern of joint judgments of two or more judges, a single opinion of the court,
majority, is by far the exception rather than the rule.
In part, this is because there is no formal procedure in Australia analogous
to the conferencing of the United States Supreme Court
judges to allocate the
opinion writing;
but does the practice drive the culture, or the culture drive the practice?
Certainly, in the High Court of Australia there is a
well-entrenched ethos of
rugged individualism, and it will be interesting, when the results come in of
our survey of the consumers
of High Court
not only whether this ethos is seen to be sustainable, but also whether it is
seen to be the product of what might be called
justifications set out above, or rather of some less attractive personality
traits such as arrogance, stubbornness,
or self-indulgence.
Balancing competing goals in our constitutional ecosystems
truth, the tension between collectivism and individualism in judicial
decision-making in final appellate courts reflects our desire
to achieve a range
of competing goals simultaneously. We value collective opinions because they
represent consensus, clarity, certainty,
and stability, whereas we value
individual opinions because we associate them with individual responsibility,
fluidity, difference,
diversity, and more easily detectable harbingers of
change. I suppose that any constitutional ecosystem will seek to strike a
between these goals, and will achieve a balance that both varies over
time and differs from that achieved in other
It is a balance we are all familiar with, though we tend to think about it
more in the macro-context of our legal system and its panoply
of institutions
than in the micro-context of how our final appellate court finds its own
operandi. It is a balance between certainty and flexibility, between continuity
and change, between consensus and diversity,
between corporatism and
individualism, between accountability and independence, between expedition and
due deliberation, perhaps
even between skepticism and faith. Understanding how
we react to and evaluate that balance may need the insights of a range of other
disciplines such as philosophy, sociology and psychology.
One voice or many in the context of democratic theory
Where, then,
does this issue of whether a final appellate court should issue the product of
its collective will or tolerate individual
idiosyncrasy sit in the context of
constitutional adjudication and
The most familiar, the most fundamental, and the most enduring debate about
constitutional adjudication and democracy is of course
the debate about the
legitimacy of judicial review: what justifies the second-guessing, by unelected
judges, of the legislative and
executive actions of our elected
know, the answer lies partly in the abstract notion of ‘the law’
— teased out by the high priests of ratiocination
and given authoritative
force by the state. In this kind of arrangement, there is, however, no room for
mere judicial fiat; the pronouncements
of the high priests must be
Which, then, is the more persuasive statement of the law: the fuzzy
compromise of a judicial collective, or the elusive common ground
embedded in
individual variations?
I dare say there is no single right answer to this question or any simple
resolution of the dilemma. The mere fact of having a multi-member
court, coupled
with the expectation of (and arguably duty to give) reasons, may be seen as more
significant to the justification
of judicial review than the form in which those
reasons are
Moreover, in the pragmatic spirit of the common law, gains can be made in
incremental improvements to the ways in which our constitutional
function, whether they lean towards the collective or the individual approach to
judicial adjudication. To the extent, for
example, that the debate is about
in judicial
may be more important factors than those discussed in this paper: for example,
the core judicial craft of good writing, the
reservation of disagreement to
points of major principle rather than of minor preference, the publication of
court-sanctioned summaries
of decisions, and so on.
In the end, any system depends for its efficacy on the capacity, skill,
commitment, and integrity of the human beings who operate
it, and the degree of
trust that particular societies repose in their institutions and their
traditions. I suspect that many countries,
perhaps most, have successful or
unsuccessful judicial systems despite, rather than because of, the detail of
their particular institutional
arrangements.

I am speaking here of domestic appellate courts, and of judicial independence in
the sense of the independence of the judges from
each other. It may be that, in
relation to at least some international tribunals, the independence of those
tribunals from external
pressure (for example, from member states) is, by
contrast, better protected by a collective view of the tribunal and
non-disclosure
of individual opinion.

Interestingly, part of the balance lies in the very idea of having a
multi-member appellate court rather than a single judge. Whether
expressed in
consolidated or fragmented form, the judgment of a multi-member court already
proffers a safeguard against individual
subjectivity.
