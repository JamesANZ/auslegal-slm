referred to in decision(s):
OF THE COURT
appellants seek leave to appeal against orders made by the primary judge on 19
August 2025, which have the effect of:
(a) staying the primary proceedings against all of the respondents until the
appellants have satisfied costs orders made in previous
Supreme Court
proceedings CIV 1309 of 2021 and CACV 55 of 2022; and
(b) staying the primary proceedings against the fourth, fifth and sixth
respondents until the appellants pay into court a total of
$30,000 ($10,000 for
each respondent) as security for the fourth, fifth and sixth respondents' costs
of the primary
proceedings.
relevant background, and the reasons for making those orders, are set out in the
primary judge's written
the impugned orders are interlocutory, the appellants require leave to appeal
from the orders under
Supreme Court Act 1935
(WA). On 22
September 2025, the court ordered that the application for leave to appeal be
determined on the papers and made orders
for the filing of further written
submissions on that question.
appellants submit that 'the legal effects of the appealed orders constitute
final judgments of fact and law and accordingly no
leave to appeal is
That submission is without merit. The usual test for determining whether an
order is final or interlocutory is whether the order,
as made, finally
determines the rights of the parties. The test requires the appellate court to
look at the consequences of the
order itself and to ask whether it finally
determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between
The orders which are the subject of the present appeal are clearly interlocutory
in character. They neither bring an end to the
primary proceedings nor finally
determine any of the rights claimed in those proceedings. Rather, the primary
orders simply stay
the primary proceedings until previous costs orders have been
satisfied and security for costs has been paid into court.
general principles governing applications for leave to appeal were summarised by
this court in
Pty Ltd v CITIC
We adopt that summary without repeating it. For present purposes, the following
points may be
emphasised:
courts exercise particular caution (sometimes referred to as 'special
restraint') in reviewing interlocutory decisions on
matters of practice and
to appeal from a discretionary decision involving a matter of practice and
procedure will not ordinarily be granted unless the
application raises an issue
of principle, a question of general public importance or the applicant for leave
can demonstrate that
significant injustice is likely to result if leave is not
Ordinarily,
while not being rigid or exhaustive criteria, the considerations to be taken
into account by this court upon an exercise
of the discretion to grant or refuse
leave to appeal are:
(a) first, whether the decision was wrong or, at the least, attended with
sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered; and
(b) secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if the decision is left
unreversed, supposing the decision to be wrong.
is, however, well established that leave to appeal may be granted whenever the
interests of justice require it.
our view, it is not in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal in the
present case, even on the assumption that the
primary decision was wrong. The
primary orders were the result of discretionary decisions on matters of practice
and procedure,
and it is against the interests of justice and case management
principles to fragment the primary proceedings by granting leave to
against orders of that kind. The appeal does not raise any important question
of general principle.
primary orders do not prevent the appellants from pursuing the primary
proceedings. Rather, the appellants are required to satisfy
outstanding costs
orders made in the earlier proceedings (which have not been set aside) and pay
$30,000 into court as security for
costs as a condition of pursuing the primary
proceedings. There is no evidence that the appellants lack the means to satisfy
outstanding costs orders or make the required payment into court. The
primary judge noted that there was no suggestion in the primary
proceedings that
the appellants were unable to comply with the orders, were impecunious or that
granting the stay would prevent the
appellants from maintaining the primary
proceedings.
There is no challenge to that finding in the appeal.
appellants claim that relief should be granted in the appeal to ensure 'the
court's processes are not abused by the enforcement
of orders obtained by
However, the allegation of fraud sought to be pursued in the primary proceedings
is no more than an unsubstantiated allegation at
this stage. The alleged
'admission' of the fraud is said to be constituted by an admission by a lawyer
acting for the first, second
and third respondents in Federal Court proceedings.
The appellants have not adduced evidence in these proceedings of the making of
that admission. In any event, the costs orders in the earlier proceedings, as
orders of a superior court of record, remain valid
and the appellants are required to comply with those orders while they are
extant. If the earlier costs orders are ultimately set
aside in the primary
proceedings, the appellants may have a restitutionary claim in relation to any
payment of costs which they have
made pursuant to those
are satisfied that no substantial injustice would result from leaving the
primary orders unreversed, even supposing the primary
judge's discretionary
decision to make those orders to be wrong. Leave to appeal should be refused on
that basis, and there is no
need to address the merits of the appellants'
grounds of appeal.
therefore order
to appeal is refused.
appeal is dismissed.
We would hear from
the parties on questions of costs, which prima facie should follow the

Supreme Court of Western Australia.
