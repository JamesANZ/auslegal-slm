reasons published by me on 8 October
I determined that the
rejection of the worker’s claim in respect of a psychiatric injury
allegedly sustained on 4 March 2014
must be set aside.
concluding remarks invited counsel to address me as to the orders that should
follow. I extended that invitation because the focus
of the submissions advanced
by the parties at trial concerned issues of compensability.
of an abundance of caution I wished to give the parties a final opportunity to
make any submissions they felt they needed to before
I expressed a final
conclusion.
put the matter beyond issue it follows that the time relevant to any appeal
rights does not commence to run until today.
worker’s case is that since 4 March 2014 he has been unable to work as a
result of his ongoing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
He gave evidence of
experiencing a variety of symptoms including headaches, body ache, palpitations,
sweating, dizziness, nausea,
vomiting and general weakness associated with
fearful apprehension. He said that there had been no change in that
is supported by the evidence of his treating psychiatrist Dr Nagesh.
Hundertmark expressed the opinion that symptoms of nausea and dry
retching/vomiting were unusual and not usually associated with
depressive illness. It led him to suggest that these episodes might be
consciously motivated.
clearly the worker has a histrionic personality and objectively he overreacted
to the events at work on 4 March 2014. That was
apparent from the evidence of Dr
it is a fundamental tenet of workers compensation law that an employer takes a
worker as he or she is. It is therefore no answer
to the worker’s claim of
ongoing incapacity that a more balanced and less histrionic person would have
Notwithstanding
my reservations about the worker’s credibility I accept his evidence on
this topic. Having observed him give
his evidence I thought the he was genuinely
distressed.
reject the suggestion that his presentation was contrived. On this issue, where
their evidence varies, I prefer the evidence of
Dr Nagesh. My impression was
that his opinion was based on how the worker actually presented. My impression
was that the seemingly
contrary opinion expressed by Dr Hundertmark was no more
than an expression of scepticism based on an apparent deviation from the
pattern of symptoms that a person with a standard depressive illness
experiences.
find that since 5 March 2014 the worker has been and continues to be totally
incapacitated for work. He is therefore entitled to
weekly payments from that
date and continuing until they are lawfully discontinued in accordance with the
Act. He is also entitled
to recover the cost of s 32 expenses reasonably
incurred as a result of the compensable injury.
grant the parties liberty to apply as to quantum.
