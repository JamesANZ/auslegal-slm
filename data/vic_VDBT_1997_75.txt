APPEARANCES: -
MR RAY HILLE, DIRECTOR OF THE APPLICANT
- MR JOHN BYRNE, DIRECTOR OF THE RESPONDENT
DATE OF HEARING:
1 AUGUST, 1997
DATE OF DETERMINATION:
5 AUGUST, 1997
REASONS FOR DETERMINATION:
The Respondent is the owner of a residence at 75 Maribyrnong Road, Ascot
Vale. The residence is comprised of a two-storey Victorian
balconied building
which faces north onto Maribyrnong Road, with an existing extension at the south
(rear) which is some years old.
On 14 January, 1997 the Respondent entered into a major domestic building
contract with the Applicant under which the Applicant was
to construct on the
west side of the residence, an entertaining room and verandah above a garage
("the extension").
The west wall of the extension was to be one metre from the west boundary
fence of the Respondent’s land.
It was part of the Applicant’s obligations under the contract to
excavate a driveway leading into the new garage. The width
of the driveway was
not specified; it was simply to be of an appropriate width. By definition, it
was not specified how close to
either the west boundary fence or the west wall
of the residence the driveway excavation was to be.
The contract made it clear that the Applicant was not required to construct
any paving on the driveway or any retaining walls. The
parties envisaged that
the driveway paving work would be carried out by the Respondent’s
landscape gardener, one Lucy Rush.
The Respondents gave evidence that Lucy Rush
was also expected to construct a small retaining wall towards the north (front)
the west side of the residence, but that this was not to be structural.
The Applicant carried out the excavation for the driveway and encountered a
On 4 April, 1997, the Applicant observed a loss of soil stability around the
footings at what is best described as the south west
corner of the original part
of the residence. This caused the Applicant concern as it appeared to be
serious enough to warrant prompt
remedial action.
The Applicant arranged for a consulting engineer, Danny Borzillo of Borzillo
and Associates Consulting Engineers Pty Ltd., to inspect
A letter from Mr Borzillo to the Applicant dated 16 April, 1997 was tendered.
Mr Borzillo was not present to give evidence, but the
Tribunal is empowered to
inform itself by examining relevant correspondence and documents, and is not
bound by the rules of evidence:
sub sections 77 and 79 of the Domestic Building
Contracts and Tribunal Act 1995 ("the Act").
Mr Borzillo’s letter states:
"A Site Inspection was carried out on the 4th April, 1997 to check on the
concerns of loss of the soil stability reported to us by
the builder. Our
inspection revealed a 60 degrees battered slope approximately 500 - 1000mm away
from the adjacent footing. Further
to our site instruction on the 4th April,
1997, we confirmed that the slope cut observed had failed due to a leak in an
down pipe and stormwater pipe and due to existing rain conditions which
caused a wash out of the soil. The temporary stability of
the site cut was
undermined due to the presence of the water via the leak of a water main going
into the house under the stairs on
the eastern side which has been continually
running for an unknown period. This has saturated the soil near the retaining
caused it to collapse away from the footing.
This could not have been foreseen by the builder thus the slope stability
works had to be implemented immediately to rectify the stability
of the site
Mr John Byrne, Director of the Respondent, attended the site meeting.
The Applicant also tendered a letter written by Mr Paul Mottram, Construction
Manager of the Applicant, dated 18 April, 1997.
Again, Mr Mottram was not present to give evidence in person. The fact of Mr
Mottram’s absence was stated by Mr Hille at the
commencement of the
hearing, and the Applicant sought an adjournment of the hearing. The Respondent
opposed the application for
an adjournment, with this knowledge and the
application for an adjournment was refused. I consider it appropriate to have
to the contents of the letter. It states:
Re: Meeting with the client, Mr John Byrne and engineer, Mr Danny
Borzillo on site at 75 Maribyrnong Road, Ascot Vale on 4 April,
A meeting of the above parties was called regarding soil erosion to the
bluestone footing on the western corner of the original two
I called for the meeting because of the continual flow of water from under
the house running into our excavation and footings, thus
causing the soil to
collapse from our cut-out and making the existing residence unstable.
The cause of the water was traced back to a split in the 20mm main coming
into the house thus continually allowing water to pour through
the footings of
the residence.
On inspection we were instructed to prop up the existing soil to stop
erosion and were told that a retaining wall would have to be
built to hold the
existing soil
. This Danny Borzillo promptly designed by 8 April, 1997.
I then priced the works and approached John Byrne as to the outcome and the
cost. He replied that this was acceptable
. He also asked me to add to his
cost the laying of bluestone facings to the face of the concrete wall. I said I
would find out
this cost but suggested he go direct with the company
On the 10 April I faxed John Byrne the engineer’s report and cost
and asked for a reply as soon as possible as it was necessary
to get on with
this work. John Byrne phoned the same day giving his verbal approval.
We commenced the works the next day at 7.30 am. I knocked on the door for
the variation to be signed. My knocks went unheeded.
Eventually a young girl
opened the door and informed me that he would see me at 9.00 am. By this time I
had returned to the office
whereby I continually phoned the residence to be
confronted only by an answering machine.
I was informed later in the day by Ray Hille that John Byrne had refused to
pay for the requested works"
(emphasis added).
In addition to constructing the retaining walls on the west wall of the
residence, the Applicant also constructed a retaining wall
at the west boundary
Mr John Byrne gave sworn evidence before the Tribunal. His evidence was
relevant in these respects:
(a) He said that the Respondent planned to have constructed, by Lucy Rush but
not the Applicant, paving to the driveway, a retaining
wall of some kind west of
the excavation for the driveway which would support the west boundary fence, and
a non-structural retaining
wall along the west wall of the residence towards the
front. That is, to a limited but not insignificant extent, the work that the
Applicant performed was work that the Respondent proposed to have carried
(b) The precise width of the driveway and the excavation for it was not
specified in the contract.
(c) He agreed that at the site meeting he said that something had to be
done. In fact, Mr Byrne was also concerned at the soil erosion
footing and told the Applicant’s Supervisor to "do something about it
(d) He said that when Mr Borzillo said that some work had to be done on both
sides of the excavation for the garage, Mr Byrne agreed.
However Mr Byrne was
silent on whether the Respondent would pay for that work. I consider that this
silence would have been misleading
to the Applicant, perhaps even calculated to
(e) After the work was performed, with Mr Byrne’s knowledge, he refused
to sign the Applicant’s Variation No.1 dated 10
April, 1997.
There are numerous provisions in the Act, and a provision in the
Contracts Guarantee Act 1987
which preceded it, which impose on a builder the
obligation to have instructions to carry out variations signed by the building
The provisions in the Act include: section 16, 33 and 37.
However, sub-section 37(3) states:
"(3) A builder is not entitled to recover any money in respect of a variation
(a) the builder
(i) has complied with this section; and
(ii) can establish that the variation is made necessary by circumstances
that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the builder
at the time the
contract was entered into; or
(b) the Tribunal is satisfied -
(i) that there are exceptional circumstances or that the builder would
suffer a significant or exceptional hardship by the operation
of paragraph
(ii) that it would not be unfair to the building owner for the builder to
recover the money.
(4) If sub-section (3) applies, the builder is entitled to recover the cost
of carrying out the variation plus a reasonable profit.
On the facts of this case, many of which are agreed by the parties as noted
above, I have no hesitation in concluding that the need
to construct the
retaining wall on the west wall of the residence arose from circumstances that
could not have been reasonably foreseen
by the Applicant when the contract was
entered into, and that the Respondent well knew that the work was being carried
out for its
benefit at a cost to the Applicant. By not allowing the Applicant
to be paid for that work the Respondent would be unjustly enriched.
I find that
these matters constitute an exceptional circumstance within the meaning of
37(3) (b) (i) of the Act, and that it is
fair that the Respondent pay for the
The work performed constructing the retaining wall on the west boundary of
the property is in a somewhat different position. Mr Hille
said that that work
was "necessary" rather than "urgent" because the fence was being undermined by
the excavation but was not in
any imminent danger.
I am content to treat this work as part of the variation which is to be paid
by the Respondent. The work was carried out at the same
time as the
construction of the other retaining wall. The Applicant provided a cost
breakdown which showed that the two retaining
walls were costed as the same job.
The Respondent always planned to have this work done - no doubt at a cost.
The parties were represented at the hearing by Directors rather than
professional advocates. In the circumstances it is appropriate
Respondent be ordered to pay the Applicant $4,500.00, interest on that sum at
the rate of 13.2% per annum from 29 April,
1997, and the Applicant’s
costs, being the $200.00 fee paid on the Application.
