(06733297/01/02)
Determination of Review Panel made
on 26th April
(Hearings 6th April 1994, 26th April
Review Officer Mason
This is the further consideration of an application lodged on
4th June 1992 by Desmond Peter Memen as worker under a contract of service
with Pasminco Metals-BAHS Pty Ltd as employer. The application seeks a review
of a closed period decision made by the employer on
29th May 1992.
Background to the matter is set out in my adjournment decision or
17th March 1993 (6 WRO Determination 93-0109;
[1993] SAWCRP 109)
determination of 19th May 1993 (6 WRO Determination 93-0406;
[1993] SAWCRP
, and, more importantly and more relevantly for present purposes, the
judgement of Her Honour Judge Parsons in
Pasminco-BHAS v Memen
(unreported), WCAT Print A11/1994;
(1994) 6 WCATR 27
[1994] SAWCAT 11
11th February 1994.
The outcome of the appeal, as I read Her
Honour's judgement, was a finding that the issue of causation, raised by the
exempt employer,
had unnecessarily pre-occupied the parties and myself and, as a
result, the enquiry and the evidence as to the extent of the worker's
was insufficient to support the eventual finding as to continuing incapacity.
Her Honour's published judgment concluded
"... In the circumstances it is appropriate that the matter be referred back
to the Review Officer so that appropriate evidence can
be heard, appropriate
findings of fact made and a fresh determination made as to whether the worker
had an incapacity for work after
29 May 1992."
Her Honour made formal
orders dated the same day which were signed and sealed by the Registrar of the
Tribunal. The order was that
".... the matter be remitted to the Review Officer for further hearing as to
whether the worker had an incapacity for work after
29th May 1993 [sic], and for
a fresh determination."
Subsequently, it appears that counsel for the
parties appeared in chambers before Her Honour on 1st March 1994 and made
further submissions,
as a result of which the order was varied to read that
"..... the matter be remitted to
Review Officer for further
hearing as to whether the worker had an incapacity for work after 29th May
1993 [sic], and for a fresh
determination."
Minutes of this order were
also signed and sealed by the Registrar.
The file had already returned
physically to my hands by the time this order was made, but as the underlined
alteration only appeared
to expand the range of Review Officers capable of
dealing with it, not to limit that range, I proceeded to list the matter. When
it first came on before me, Mr P M Salu of counsel for the
employer submitted that an error had been made and that the matter should
before me. Asked to explain the "error", he indicated that the expression "a
Review Officer" in Her Honour's revised order
was meant to convey a Review
Officer other than myself. That did not appear to me to be the tenor of either
the published judgment
or the revised order, whatever the power was for the
making of the latter nearly three weeks after Her Honour had appeared to be
functus officio
– a power that the parties are not concerned to
enquire into, however, and by which I am accordingly bound (see
Mason and WCAT
(1992) 59 SASR 117
[1992] SASC 3650
at 118-119). I
therefore listed the matter for argument as to whether I should be disqualified
from further hearing the matter.
Mr T J Heffernan of counsel for
the worker indicated the worker had no view either way and did not attend today
when the point was
When the matter again came on before me today,
Mr O W Downs of counsel for the employer submitted that my
previous decision was made
without evidence and prudence demanded that the
matter not come back to me because it might leave a doubt in the minds of the
as to whether the matter was being approached fairly. In the words of
the old legal maxim, "justice must not only be done, it must
be seen to be
He made no suggestion of actual bias.
Ruling on questions
of this kind is one of the highest duties of any judicial or quasi-judicial
officer. The basic rule is that the
officer should not sit if a reasonable
person would apprehend a real risk that the officer would not bring a fair and
unbiased mind
to the task at hand. As many authorities emphasise, a simple
expectation that a particular officer may decide a case adversely to
does not amount to an apprehension of bias.

[1983] HCA 17
Court (Mason, Murphy, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ) in a joint judgment wrote
"In a case such as the present where there is no allegation of actual bias,
the question whether a judge who is confident of his
own ability to determine
the case before him fairly and impartially on the evidence should refrain from
sitting because of a suggestion
that the views which he has expressed in his
judgment in some previous case may result in an appearance of pre-judgment can
difficult one involving matters 'of degree and particular circumstances may
strike different minds in different ways' (per Aickin

(1980) 55 ALJR 12].
at first instance considers that there is any real possibility that his
participation in a case might lead to a reasonable
apprehension of pre-judgement
or bias, he should, of course, refrain from sitting. On the other hand, it
would be an abdication
of judicial function and an encouragement of procedural
abuse for a judge to adopt the approach that he should automatically disqualify
himself whenever he was requested by one party so to do on the grounds of a
possible appearance of pre-judgement or bias, regardless
of whether the other
party desired that the matter be dealt with by him as the judge to whom the
hearing of the case had been entrusted
by the ordinary procedures and practice
of the particular court."

[1986] HCA 39
(also known as
Re: JRL; ex parte
) Mason J (as he then was) wrote -
"It seems that the acceptance by this court of the test of reasonable
apprehension of bias in such cases as
R v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong
(1976) 136 CLR
[1976] HCA 39]
has led to an increase in the
frequency of applications by litigants that judicial officers should disqualify
themselves from sitting
in particular cases on account of their participation in
other proceedings involving one of the litigants or on account of conduct
the litigation. It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of
disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that
the judicial officer will not
decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will
decide the case adversely
to one party. There may be many situations in which
previous decisions of a judicial officer on issues of fact law may generate
expectation that he is likely to decide issues in a particular case adversely to
one of the parties. But this does not mean either
that he will approach the
issues in that case otherwise than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in
the sense in which that expression
is used in the authorities or that his
previous decisions provide an acceptable basis for inferring that there is a
reasonable apprehension
that he will approach the issues in this way. In cases
of this kind, disqualification is only made out by showing that there is
reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment and this must be
'firmly established':
R v Commonwealth Conciliation and
Arbitration Commission; Ex Parte Angliss Group
(1969) 122 CLR
[1969] HCA 10
at 553-554;
R v Watson; Ex parte
(1976) 136 CLR 248
[1976] HCA 39
Re Lusink; Ex
(1980) 55 ALJR 12
at 50-51. Although it is
important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that
judicial officers discharge
their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too
readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that
seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by
someone thought to be more likely to decide the case
in their favour."
is to be noted that the theme clearly emerges from both cases, and many others,
that it is equally as important that an officer
not disqualify himself (or
herself) wrongly as it is that he or she not fail to do so when
In his submissions, Mr Downs seemed almost to suggest
that the matter is something akin to an exercise of discretion but, with
it must be a question of law whether, in particular circumstances, an
officer is disqualified.
I have searched diligently through Her Honour's
published judgment and have found no direct suggestion or any comment from which
inference could reasonably be drawn indicating real or apparent bias or
impropriety of any sort. Mr Downs does not suggest otherwise.
Her Honour criticises, but that is why the matter has been returned to the
Review Panel. Not every criticism from a
supervisory jurisdiction disqualifies
the lower body from re-hearing a remitted matter. The criticism is that I
allowed myself to
be distracted by extraneous issues raised by the employer and
failed to make necessary findings to support the final conclusion I
drew on the
correct issue. There was too little evidence to support that final conclusion.
There is no suggestion by the Tribunal
that I have made a decision on the basis
of no evidence at all; the appeal judgment in fact outlines the (deficient)
relevant evidence
at the lower portion of p.5 and the upper portion of p.6.
There is no suggestion or inference that further evidence, not subject
distraction of extraneous issues, could not be weighed to give a correct result
unencumbered by the result obtained on the
last occasion. I cannot see any
reason why the proverbial reasonable party or observer would apprehend that the
hearing or weighing
of the evidence would not be conducted fairly or
open-mindedly.
Accordingly, my duty as described in the case law is
clearly to refuse to disqualify myself from the further hearing of this
DETERMINATION
This application is adjourned
for hearing on a date to be fixed [subsequently fixed as Friday,
16th September 1994 at 10am, with Tuesday,
20th September 1994 at
11.30am also set aside].
In relation to Section 93(1)(d) of the Act, I
advise that as this determination does not finally dispose of this matter, no
at this stage lies: see
Advertiser Newspapers v Despoja
(1990) 159 LSJS 75.
If either party considers that inconvenience
will result from the fact that I am directed in both the first and the amended
of order to consider incapacity only after 29th May 1993, I invite
them to approach the Tribunal with a view, if there is any power
to do it and
the Tribunal is so minded, to the further amendment of the minutes of order
prior to 16th September 1994; otherwise
I will be bound to observe that
direction and will be unable to make findings as to incapacity between
29th May 1992 and 29th May
1993. Apart from s.82 and s.97, the
powers of all review authorities under the Act appear to be similar. On my own
reading of the
Act and the
Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal Rules
(as amended), the only power the Tribunal as such possesses that
approaches a "slip rule" is Rule 22, which seems to be confined
to cases of
non-compliance with the Rules; however, interpretation of those rules is clearly
not a matter for me. If there was a
power to make the additional order of 1st
March 1994, which appears to involve a substantive amendment of a previously
judgment, rather than correction of a mere "slip", then it may be
that the same power will allow a further variation. This is a
matter I am bound
to leave to the parties to take up with the Tribunal, if they
