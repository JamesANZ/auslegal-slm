Legislative Provisions:

Consent to subletting
under 174 and 175 of the
Retirement Villages Act
The Tribunal directs the operator to consent to the respondent entering into
a residential tenancy agreement with Ms Platthy in respect
of Unit ..., Beauty
Point Retirement Resort upon the terms and conditions in the standard form
agreement in Schedule 1 of the
Residential Tribunal Regulation 1999
term of 12 months.
REASONS FOR DECISION
APPLICATION
An application was lodged with the Registry by the
operator on 21 December 2001 for an order for:
"A declaration that the
operator is not obliged to consent to the proposed sublease of Unit ..., 33
Bernard Road, Padstow Heights,
pursuant to section 174(6)(b)."
reasons given for requesting the orders were that:
"We are required to
seek consent of the Mortgagee to any sublease and the Mortgagee has not given
consent to the sublease."
By letter dated 14 January 2002, Dennison
Investments Pty Ltd sought to amend the stated reasons for seeking the order to
reasons which were apparent from correspondence with the executor of the
estate, Mr Bruce Mitchell. Attention was drawn to clause
9(b) of the lease
which permits a sublease if certain conditions are met. The letter to Mr
Mitchell requests advice as to whether
he agreed to comply with the conditions.
It also requests that an attached tenancy application form be completed and
signed. The
letter advises that if the information provided is satisfactory,
they will then require the proposed tenant to attend an interview
at the Resort
so as to enable his/her suitability to be assessed. The letter to Mr Mitchell
concluded with the following paragraph:
"The former operator, Overton
Investments Pty Limited, holds a mortgage over the Resort. Under the terms of
that mortgage, Overton’s
consent is required to the proposed sub-lease.
We understand that Overton’s position is that it will not consent to the
unless, at least, arrears owing to Overton are paid in full. Would
you please contact Overton and advise us whether you will be
in a position to
obtain Overton’s consent."
PROCEEDINGS
The hearing on
21 January 2002 proceeded by way of submissions by Mr Witheridge and Mr Jabbour
on behalf of the operator and Mr Carnegie
on behalf of the resident. Ms Platthy
gave evidence about her mother’s age and state of health, and that there
was no physical
or mental problem that would prevent her from taking up
Section 174(4) provides as
174 Letting or subletting of premises
(4) A resident
of residential premises in a
retirement village
must not let or
sublet the premises unless he or she has given the operator of the village
written particulars of:
(a) the name and age of the proposed tenant or
subtenant, and
(b) the term of the proposed residential tenancy agreement,
(c) such other matters in relation to the proposed agreement as the
operator may reasonably require, and the operator has
in writing to the agreement.
is clear from this subsection that the operator is entitled to request written
particulars as set out and including such other
matters in relation to the
proposed agreement as the operator may reasonably require.
present case, Mr Mitchell had, on behalf of the estate, given certain
particulars to the operator by letter dated 14 December
2001. The response of
the operator was to lodge an application for a declaration that it not be
obliged to consent to the proposed
sublease. The letter of 14 January 2002
announcing that the operator had adopted a new policy and requesting the
completion of a
tenancy application form and the attendance of a proposed
sub-tenant at an interview appears to be an afterthought. Any written
particulars which this request may elicit would not appear to have been
determinative of any decision on the part of the operator
to consent or not to
consent. Apart from all this, I cannot see that any further written particulars
which would result from a reply
to the letter of 14 January 2002 cover any
matters not already covered by disclosure in Mr Mitchell’s letter dated 14
2001. While the operator is certainly entitled to written particular
agreement, I do not
believe that this includes a request that any proposed tenant attend an

the effects on the operator’s profits or income if it is impeded in the
sale of or re-letting of units, I note (as I have done previously) that the

I am satisfied that the resident did give
notice as required by
section 174(4).
Having regard to all of the
submissions and the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the
operator’s decision not to consent
is reasonable having regard to the
considerations of
section 175(1)
. I therefore propose to make an
order in terms of
section 175(3)(a).
