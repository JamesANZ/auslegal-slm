Introduction
[1] The first plaintiff (as liquidator) and the second
plaintiff (in liquidation) bring suit against Ms Praveen Kumar claiming
$131,954.00
in relation to what is alleged to be an unreasonable
director-related transaction pursuant to
Corporations Act 2001
(Commonwealth). The plaintiffs have been unable to serve the defendant as
required by the Uniform
Civil Procedure Rules
The application
plaintiffs seek orders that:
1. Pursuant to rule 117 (UCPR) service of the claim and statement of claim filed
19 May 2025 is deemed to have been effected on 7
[3] The plaintiffs seek to proceed ex parté, that is without the
application being served, which is obviously understandable
in terms of the
relief sought.
[4] The application seeks a decision without oral hearing
pursuant to rule 489 (UCPR).
[5] The plaintiffs have complied with the
requirements of rule 490 (UCPR), including attaching a notice in the approved
form and accompanying
with the application the draft order and written
submissions in support.
The relevant rule
[6] The relevant rule is rule
[7] It provides as follows:
Informal service
(a) for any reason a document is not served as required by this chapter but the
document or a copy of it came into the possession
of the person to be served;
(b) The court is satisfied on the evidence before it that the document
came into the person’s possession on or before a particular
The court may, by order, decide that the possession of the document is service
for these rules on the day it came into the person’s
possession, or
another day stated in the order.
[8] The leading authority in relation to
informal service is AMCI Pty Ltd v Corcoal Management Pty Ltd &
[9] That decision of Jackson J
considered service on a defendant who was outside Australia. After discussing
substituted service under
rule 116 (4) UCPR for service of a person outside of
Queensland, His Honour concluded that rule 117 UCPR should be interpreted as
applying also to proceedings where service was outside of
[10] In the present proceeding,
the defendant is outside Queensland, apparently residing in Victoria. An
originating process for service
outside Queensland must be served in accordance
Service and Execution of Process Act 1992
(Commonwealth).
[11] His Honour did observe
“The court exercising jurisdiction over a defendant which has no
other apparent ties to the state of Queensland is a relevant
factor to take into
account in deciding whether, as a matter of discretion, informal service should
be ordered under
respect of the discretion to be exercised with respect to granting informal
service under
UCPR His Honour said:
“There is no uniformity in
the rules of court in different Australian jurisdictions as to what will be
sufficient for satisfactory
informal service by reason of receipt of or
attention being drawn to a
[13] AMCI Pty Ltd v
Corcoal Management Pty Ltd & Ors was followed in Cardillo v Moreton Bay
Trailer Boat Club Incorporated
, a decision of
Muir DCJ (as Her Honour then was).
[14] Her Honour quoting from Jackson J in
AMCI Pty Ltd found –
“There are no rigid rules in relation to
how the discretion under UCRP
should be exercised.
It follows that
each case turns on its
[15] Her Honour considered,
but distinguished the decision of Porter KC DCJ in Egan v
The relevant facts causing that
decision to be distinguishable were:
1. First actual service had been reasonably attempted on Posman – whereas
in Cardillo, Her Honour observed “the applicant
ought to have made more of
an effort to serve the counterclaim before falling back on the power under
2. In Posman, the document came into the possession of a senior
litigation secretary at a legal firm of the defendant.
[16] Her Honour concluded that the fact that the respondent had now become aware
that the counterclaim came into the applicant’s
possession – does
not justify the exercise of the discretion to order informal service in that
[17] Important to the
consideration of the exercise of the discretion Her Honour said:
“Secondly, in the present case there is no cogent evidence that there
were any or significant legal or practical difficulties
in affecting service of
the defence and counterclaim on the applicant personally...
Even if there
were difficulties, again the observation of Justice Jackson in AMCI that UCPR
117 is not intended to resolve the difficulties
in the matter of service
required by the UCPR – is most apposite”
[18] Her Honour further observed in
relation to whether reasonable efforts had been made to serve the counter claim
on the applicant
“This is most unsatisfactory. One attempt at
service in a year is simply not reasonable in the circumstances of this case.
it was an expensive attempt does not change
[19] Both Jackson J in AMCI
and Muir DCJ (as Her Honor then was) in Cardillo concluded that relevant to the
exercise of the discretion
, were the applicants’ attempts
to serve the document as required by the UCPR. Indeed, Porter KC DCJ in Egan v
Posman also found
in relation to the exercise of the discretion that relevant to
it was “actual service has been reasonably
attempted”.
[20] In a recent
decision, His Honour Judge Andreatidis KC DCJ made an order for informal service
in Ischebeck Titan (Australia) Pty
Ltd v Formconnect Pty Ltd &
[21] His Honour, in relatively
concise reasons, was satisfied that the plaintiff’s solicitors sent a copy
of the claim and statement
of claim to an email address for the second defendant
and that the second defendant had responded by email acknowledging receipt
the documents and asking to start a payment plan. His Honour did not consider or
discuss the issue of proof of actual service
having been reasonably attempted.
[22] Notwithstanding that, having identified that the statement of claim had
come into possession of the person to be served (the
second defendant) His
Honour made orders for informal service.
The applicant’s
[23] The applicant relies on the following
• Affidavit Noah Tindiglia filed 9 July 2025.
[24] In her
affidavit, Ms Tindiglia deposes to the following:
• The second
plaintiff was ordered into liquidation on 19 December 2024 and the first
plaintiff was appointed liquidator.
• An employee of the liquidator had
corresponded with the defendant at email address
prakumar1609@gmail.com
11:19am she emailed to
prakumar1609@gmail.com
a copy of the
claim and statement of claim and form 1 (under
Service and Execution of Process
• At 3:52pm on 7 July 2025,
she received a response by email under the hand of “Praveen” from
email address
prakumar1609@gmail.com
which acknowledged the earlier email and set out responses in respect of the
Attempts at service
plaintiff’s outline does not seek to rely on an affidavit of Graham
Madders filed 9 July 2025.
[26] That affidavit has been filed in the
proceedings and confirms that Mr Madders (a process server) attempted service
upon the defendant
at an address at 12 Argyle Way Wantirna South,
Disposition
[27] There are no rigid rules in relation to how
the discretion under
UCPR should be exercised, and each case turns on
[28] Whilst proof of
reasonable attempts at actual service is a consideration, that does not appear
to preclude an order for informal
service where otherwise the court is satisfied
the requirements of
UCPR have been met. Andreatidis KC DCJ was
satisfied in Ischebeck Titan (Australia) Pty Ltd v Formconnect Pty Ltd &
there had been an acknowledgement of receipt of the claim and
statement of claim, to order informal service.
[29] I am satisfied that the
claim and statement of claim were not served as required by chapter 4 of the
UCPR as personal service
has not been affected.
[30] I am satisfied that the
claim and statement of claim came into the possession of the defendant (the
person to be served) and
came into the possession of the defendant at no later
than 3:52pm on 7 July 2025.
[31] Accordingly, I order as follows:
1. Pursuant to rule 117 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules service of the
claim and statement of claim filed 19 May 2025 is taken
to have been served on
the defendant on 7 July 2025.
2. Costs are reserved.
