FINDINGS AND
Who was dependent for support on the worker
25 of the 1987 Act provides:
death results from an injury, the amount of compensation payable by the employer
under this Act shall be-
(a) the amount of $750,000 (the ‘lump sum death benefit’),
which is to be apportioned among any dependants who are wholly
dependent for support on the worker or (if there are no such dependants) paid to
the worker's legal personal representative...”
The amount of
$750,00 has been indexed, and the parties have agreed that the correct amount to
be awarded as at 24 January 2023 was
4 of the 1998 Act then defines a dependant as
“‘dependants’ of
a worker means such of the members of the worker's family as were
wholly or in part dependent for
support on the worker at the time of
the worker's death, or would but for the incapacity due to
the injury have been so dependent...”
have carefully considered the statements/statutory declarations/documents in
evidence from:
(a) the first respondent – dated 17 April 2025 (found at page 24 of the
ARDW) and dated 16 September 2025 (found at page 1
of the first
respondent’s third ALAD);
(b) Mick Ostojic - dated 1 April 2025 (found at page 36 of the ARDW) and dated
1 May 2025 (found at page 31 of the ARDW);
(c) Vera Ostojic - dated 11 September 2025 (found at page 1 of the third
respondent’s ALAD);
(d) Kylie Sikma (the worker’s sister) - dated 11 September 2025 (found at
page 1 of the first respondent’s second ALAD);
(e) Stephen Harmer (the worker’s brother) - dated 11 September 2025 (found
at page 8 of the first respondent’s second
(f) Geoff Harmer (the worker’s brother) - dated 11 September 2025 (found
at page 16 of the first respondent’s second
(g) Lynne Harmer (the worker’s mother) - dated 17 September 2025 (found at
page 2 of the first respondent’s third ALAD)
and dated 2 October 2025
(found at page 1 of the first respondent’s fourth ALAD);
(h) Dr John Adjei (the second respondent’s counsellor) - dated 15
September 2024 (found at page 3 of the second Reply), and
(i) the second respondent’s Year 11 2025 interim report (found at page 9
of the second Reply).
evidence in these statements/statutory declarations/documents is consistent as
to all three respondents being dependent on the
worker at the date of his
first respondent and the worker had been in a relationship since 1992. They had
lived together since 2000 and were married in
2007. They had two children
together (the second respondent and the third respondent), and as at the date of
the worker’s death,
they all lived together as a family at Pitt Town.
first respondent says in her 17 April 2025 statutory declaration that the worker
was employed by the applicant, which was a family
business. He and his brothers
performed the “hands-on work” for the business, and she worked
around 14 hours per week
in the business managing payroll and invoicing. She and
the worker received similar salaries of around $88,000 gross per annum. She
“Since Adam’s injury and passing, our household is
now left without a sustainable income...I still maintained a small
role within
the company after Adam’s passing, though the business has dwindled and
it’s no longer profitable. The business
is in the process of closing, and
it has not been trading since February 2025...Adam was the heart and soul of the
company and since
his injury the business has had difficulty remaining
profitable. He was very involved in generating and obtaining new work...For
first time since 2007, I will need to go back to working outside of the family
business as the company is winding up.”
says that the worker attended “to all the handyman duties and basic home
maintenance around the home”. He was also
heavily involved in assisting
their two children with their sporting and other recreational activities, as
well as with their schooling.
family home at Pitt Town was mortgaged in the names of both the worker and the
first respondent. They shared a personal line of
credit up to $1,200,000
“which we would use towards paying our household expenses, health
insurance, bills, expenses for our
children and just about everything
first respondent’s 17 April 2025 statutory declaration poignantly
describes how the worker’s death has had a devastating
effect upon her, as
well as her children.
Ostojic’s 1 May 2025 statement details the second respondent’s
dependence upon the worker. Mick Ostojic is in an
excellent position to provide
these details, having known the second respondent for the second
respondent’s entire life and
having known the worker since the worker was
a teenager. He says:
“Joshua was completely dependent on his
father for financial support...Adam paid for Joshua’s school fees, the
on the home, and most, if not all, domestic expenses...Joshua is now in
Year 11 at high school. From discussions with his mother,
we are hoping that he
continues and completes Year 12. After high school, he may be looking at further
education at TAFE or university,
but it is a bit early to tell what he will be
able to do. He may also explore becoming a police officer...Since his
death, I have observed that Joshua is withdrawn from some of his
friends but has still managed to maintain some friendships...I understand
was undergoing counselling with Dr John Edmund K. Adjei. He had treatment for
treatment towards the end of
2024, and I am not sure if he has restarted treatment.”
second respondent’s counselling with Dr Adjei is also referred to in the
15 September 2024 report, which
“I wish to state that Joshua is going through many
situational, emotional and developmental challenges. These challenges tend
common among children of his age however, Joshua has continuously struggled to
manage his emotions after the sudden and traumatic
death of his father. Joshua
is faced with dealing with intense grief, trauma, depression, anxiety and many
existential challenges...
With the current mental health concerns mentioned
above, I wish to state that Joshua would needs support, love, care and
guidance from caregivers to enable him feel safe and loved in order
to focus on his recovery and learning. Joshua needs stability
in these trying
moments. Any sudden changes in his life could further jeopardise his mental
health and recovery...Joshua has been
humble, dedicated to treatment,
participating and engaging in therapy. I believe with time he will overcome the
challenges of his
time and mature into what he is destined to be.”
relation to the third respondent’s dependence upon the worker, there are
statements/statutory declarations from both of his
grandparents, who are in
excellent positions to provide statements, having known the third respondent for
the third respondent’s
entire life and having known the worker since the
worker was a teenager.
Ostojic says in her 11 September 2025 statutory
declaration:
“Adam had a fantastic relationship with Lachlan.
They enjoyed many hobbies and sporting activities together. Adam was a devoted
father and Lachlan adored him...Adam was the breadwinner and paid for the
mortgage, school fees, swimming lessons, sporting activities,
tutoring, and
everyday living expenses...Lachlan’s life has forever changed since his
father passed away. His schooling was
initially affected as he became
uninterested and withdrawn, however, he appears to be slowly returning to his
previous level of engagement
with his studies.”
Mick Ostojic says in his 1 April 2025 statutory
declaration:
“Adam was supportive of both of his sons. Adam
and Lachlan had a shared interest in playing and watching sports. Lachlan
in extracurricular activities, playing soccer and rugby league. Adam
would take Lachlan to training sessions and support him at his
games...Adam
would always help Lachlan with his schoolwork, particularly with mathematics.
Adam was particularly knowledgeable with
mathematics and was always happy to
everything and looked
after the family’s financial position. Lachlan lived
with Adam, Edita and Joshua at their family home in Pitt Town NSW. I understand
that Adam paid for the mortgage and utility bills, car maintenance and everyday
living expenses...Adam paid for Lachlan’s school
fees, tutoring,
extracurricular activities such as soccer and rugby league and related sporting
equipment. It is my understanding
Adam also bought Lachlan a motor bike and push
summary, the evidence is compelling that the worker and the three respondents
were a very close tight-knit family, reliant mainly
upon the worker financially.
There is no doubt in my opinion that all three respondents had reasonable
expectations that the worker
would provide support for them into the future -
TNT Group 4 Pty Limited v Halioris
(1987) 8 NSWLR 486.
from the three respondents, it now remains for me to determine whether there
were any other persons who were dependent on the
worker in that they had
reasonable expectations that he would provide support for them into the future.
In this regard, I note the
following evidence:
(a) the worker’s grandparents are deceased - see Lynne Harmer’s 2
October 2025 statement;
(b) the worker’s mother has confirmed that she did not seek any
compensation in respect of his death – see Lynne Harmer’s
2025 statement;
(c) the worker’s father was not being provided with any financial support
by the worker and there “was no expectation
of financial support or
otherwise to be expected from Adam either at the time of his passing or in the
future” - see Lynne
Harmer’s 2 October 2025 statement (noting that
she is the worker’s mother and has power of attorney in relation to the
worker’s father due to him losing capacity following a stroke in 2016);
(d) the worker’s brothers have confirmed that they do not seek any
compensation in respect of his death - see Stephen Harmer’s
11 September
2025 statement and Geoff Harmer’s 11 September 2025 statement;
(e) the worker’s sister has confirmed that she does not seek any
compensation in respect of his death – see Kylie Sikma’s
September 2025 statement;
(f) the worker had not been in any relationship or marriage other than his
relationship with the first respondent - see the first
respondent’s 17
April 2025 statutory declaration (in which she declares that she and the worker
had been in a relationship
since 1992) as well as the marriage certificate of
the worker and the first respondent dated 17 April 2007 (found at page 21 of the
ARDW - in which it is noted that he had not been previously married), and
(g) the worker had no children other than the second respondent and the third
respondent – see Lynne Harmer’s 2 October
2025 statement as well as
the first respondent’s 16 September 2025 statement.
upon this evidence (especially the statement evidence from Lynne Harmer, who
being the worker’s mother, is placed in
one of the best positions to know
his familial situation), I am satisfied that apart from the three respondents,
there were no grandparents,
parents, siblings, spouses, partners, children or
others dependent on the worker for support.
How should the amount
of $871,200 be apportioned between the three respondents, pursuant to s 29 of
the 1987 Act
29 of the 1987 Act relevantly provides:
“(1) The compensation
payable under this Division to each dependant of a deceased worker may be
apportioned by the Commission
or by the NSW Trustee.
(1A) The lump sum death benefit payable under this Division is not to be
apportioned if a deceased worker leaves only one dependant
(whether wholly or
partly dependent on the worker for support) and the whole of the lump sum death
benefit is to be paid to that
one dependant.
(1B) In apportioning the lump sum death benefit payable under this Division
between 2 or more dependants, the whole lump sum death
benefit is to be
apportioned among those dependants (so that the sum of the apportioned amounts
equals the full lump sum death benefit).”
indicated at paragraph 12 above, the parties have agreed (subject to my
approval) an apportionment of the lump sum payable under
s 25(1)(a) of the 1987
Act. The agreement in this regard is:
(a) first respondent – 66.7125803% - an amount of $581,200;
(b) second respondent – 16.0697888% - an amount of $140,000, and
(c) third respondent – 17.2176309% - an amount of $150,000.
consider this proposed apportionment to be a sound apportionment of the
appropriate lump sum having regard to the dependency levels
upon the worker of
each respondent. The apportionment allows the first respondent to receive just
over two-thirds of the lump sum,
which is appropriate considering that at the
time of the worker’s death, she had been in a long-term relationship with
worker for around 31 years. There was no evidence before me that the
relationship was not likely to continue indefinitely. Indeed,
all the evidence
suggests an extremely durable relationship between the first respondent and the
worker, with them each mutually
sharing their family’s assets,
liabilities, finances and responsibilities. The first respondent had a
reasonable expectation
of receiving substantial financial and other support from
the worker for at least 20 years of his future working life. It is also
important to note that the first respondent was only 46-years-old when the
worker died.
proposed apportionment also allows the children of the worker and the first
respondent to receive appropriate allowances for their
financial dependence upon
both the worker and the first respondent, in that they were totally dependent
upon the two of them at the
date of the worker’s death. This level of
dependence was likely to continue for some years, at least up until they had
their studies and begun work. In this regard, it is to be noted that
the second respondent was 14-years-old when the worker died,
and the third
respondent was 12-years-old when the worker died. Both of them were at stages in
their life when they were in need
of significant financial support with their
schooling, social development, and sporting/recreational activities
is no significant evidence before me that either of the children require any
special medical or other needs. Following the worker’s
death, the second
respondent required counselling during 2024, and the third respondent’s
schooling was also affected. However,
the second respondent’s counsellor
has opined a positive prognosis (see paragraph 26 above), and the third
respondent’s
tutor has declared improvement with his schooling (see
paragraph 28 above).
do note though that the second respondent is approximately 18 months older than
the third respondent. As a result as at the date
of the worker’s death,
the third respondent could have expected to receive support (especially with
schooling and social development)
from the worker for slightly longer than the
second respondent. The small difference of $10,000 between the apportioned
amounts agreed
in relation to the second respondent compared with the third
respondent is therefore entirely appropriate in these circumstances.
a result, I propose to approve the apportionment agreed between the
Are the respondents entitled to interest on the amounts
awarded to them, pursuant to s 109 of the 1998 Act
109 of the 1998 Act relevantly provides:
“(1) In any
proceedings before the Commission, the Commission may order that there is to be
included, in any sum to be paid,
interest at such rate as the Commission thinks
fit on the whole or any part of the sum for the whole or any part of the period
the sum is payable, subject to the limitations imposed by this
(2) Interest cannot be ordered under this section-
(a) on any compensation payable under Division 4 of Part 3 of the 1987 Act,
(b) on any compensation payable under this Act for any period before a claim
for the compensation was duly made, or
(c) on any compensation payable under this Act for any period during which
proceedings before the Commission were adjourned on the
application of the
claimant for the compensation or pursuant to section 102.
(3) This section does not-
(a) authorise the giving of interest upon interest, or
(b) apply in relation to any debt upon which interest is payable as of right
whether by virtue of any agreement or otherwise.”
indicated at paragraph 11(d) above, the parties have agreed as to how their
relevant interest entitlements would be calculated.
power of the Commission to award interest is however discretionary. The relevant
interest rate to be awarded is also within the
discretion of the
Commission.
v Doolan (No 2)
[1977] 1 NSWLR 601
), the Court of
Appeal said that it was necessary to determine in what respect a party has been
financially disadvantaged by delay
in the payment of (in that case) damages so
as to make an appropriate allowance of interest. Reynolds JA, Moffitt P and
agreeing on point, said:
“It provides an ancillary
power akin to an order for costs, and its purpose is to aid the court to do more
complete justice
between the parties than is otherwise possible ... It is not
designed to compensate a plaintiff for loss arising out of the cause
but to provide compensation where it is otherwise appropriate to do so for the
circumstance that a sum of money has been
outstanding to him for a period of
this reasoning, and considering the agreement of the parties, I am satisfied
that it is appropriate to exercise my discretion
to award interest, and to award
it in accordance with the agreement between the
summary, I make the following formal findings:
(a) that the worker died on 24 January 2023 as a result of injury arising out of
or in the course of his employment with the applicant,
pursuant to s
4 of the 1987 Act;
(b) that the first respondent was dependent on the worker for support;
(c) that the second respondent was dependent on the worker for support;
(d) that the third respondent was dependent on the worker for support;
(e) that there were no other persons dependent on the worker for support;
(f) that the applicant is liable to pay the amount of $871,200 pursuant to s
25(1)(a) of the
(g) that the amount of $871,200 is to be apportioned as follows, pursuant to s
29 of the 1987 Act:
(i) first respondent – 66.7125803% - $581,200;
(ii) second respondent – 16.0697888% - $140,000, and
(iii) third respondent – 17.2176309% - $150,000;
(h) that the applicant is to pay interest on the amounts awarded to the first
respondent, the second respondent, and the third respondent,
pursuant to
s 109 of the 1998 Act, as follows:
(i) first respondent - $3,507.85;
(ii) second respondent - $845.01, and
(iii) third respondent- $905.37, and
(i) that the applicant is to pay management fees on the amounts awarded to the
second respondent and the third respondent, pursuant
to s 25(1A) of the 1987
85 of the 1987 Act requires me to order payment of awards pursuant to s 25(1)(a)
of the 1987 Act to the NSW Trustee and Guardian
“in trust for the benefit
of the persons entitled”, and there is no dispute that the awards to be
entered in favour of
the second respondent and the third respondent should be
entered accordingly. However, s 85A of the 1987 Act reads as
“(1) Despite section 85, the Commission may
authorise the payment of compensation referred to in section 85 (1)--
(a) to the person who is entitled to the compensation, or
(b) to such other person, for the benefit of the person entitled to the
compensation, as the Commission thinks fit.
(2) Any such payment is to be made in the manner authorised by the
Commission.”
first respondent requests that the amount payable to her be paid to her rather
than the NSW Trustee and Guardian. I am given a
wide discretion in accordance
with s 85A of the 1987 Act in relation to how I authorise the payment of amounts
payable to dependents.
There is no reason as a result why I would not order that
the first respondent receive the amount payable to her, and I will do so.
Considering
my findings, there will be awards that the applicant pay:
(a) an amount of $581,200 together with interest of $3,507.85 to the first
respondent;
(b) an amount of $140,000 together with interest of $845.01 as well as
management fees of $8,520.36 to the NSW Trustee and Guardian
on trust for the
benefit of the second respondent, and
(c) an amount of $150,000 together with interest of $905.37 as well as
management fees of $13,310.90 to the NSW Trustee and Guardian
on trust for the
benefit of the third respondent.
parties will be given leave to approach the Commission on or before 7 November
