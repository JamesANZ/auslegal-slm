Comparative regional protection frameworks for refugees: Norms and norm
entrepreneurs
Susan Kneebone*
The focus of this collection is generally on regional approaches to refugee
protection, and specifically upon the norms, and the norm
entrepreneurs of those
approaches. In 2015 two refugee protection crises highlighted the importance of
regional approaches to refugee
protection: namely the Rohingya ‘boat
people’ crisis which unfolded in the Indian Ocean in May 2015 and the
Syrian refugees towards Europe which escalated from the same period.
In each case it was the dissemination of shocking images in
the global media
which raised attention to the crisis: in the situation of the Rohingya it was
the discovery of 26 bodies in a mass
grave of smuggled Rohingya in a
trafficking camp in southern Thailand in early May,
whereas in the
case of Syrian refugees it was the single image on 2 September
of the body of a young Syrian boy named Eylan. In fact both crises have been
simmering for some time and arose from protracted, unresolved
involving groups from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. The Syrian
crisis is an outcome of the conflict in Syria
which is now in its fifth year,
and which has displaced half of the country’s population of 22 million
people. The Rohingya
situation is complex and long-standing, but was
precipitated by the actions of people smugglers who abandoned their human cargo
Each crisis has highlighted the strengths and limits of regional approaches
to refugee protection and the importance of looking closely
at the underlying
norms, and the identities and activities of the relevant ‘norm
entrepreneurs’ at the regional level.
For example, in 2009 the Rohingya
situation was regarded as a ‘mini-crisis’ which led to the
reinvigoration of the regional
process known as the Bali Process, led by
Australia, and whose official title is
Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related
Transnational Crime
Yet, the Rohingya situation was not
resolved by that or any similar regional process. In the context of the current
Syrian crisis,
the spotlight now is on the mechanisms of refugee protection
which the European Union (EU) has developed. The response of these mechanisms
this crisis will provide an insight into their effectiveness.
The purposes of the papers which make up this this collection are to identify
the key actors in promoting refugee protection norms
and their agenda-setting or
‘steering’ modes in the regional context; and to evaluate dominant
mechanisms and discourses
on regional refugee protection. Some issues
considered by the papers in this special issue are whether
