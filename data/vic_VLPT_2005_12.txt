CONCERNING A DISPUTE
between Mr Peter
Michael Fraser (the “client”) and Slater and Gordon (the
“legal practitioner”).
REASONS OF LEGAL PROFESSION TRIBUNAL FOR DECISION GIVEN
ON 9 MAY, 2005
(Section 409 Legal Practice Act)
[2005] VLPT 12
When this dispute first came before the Tribunal for
hearing on 7 March 2005 Mr S Lethlean appeared for the client and Mr A Pillay
appeared for the legal practitioner.
The circumstances of Mr
Pillay’s appearance were that he had received instructions at the last
moment in response to enquiries
made of the legal practitioner by Tribunal staff
as to why there had not been an appearance earlier on in the day.
Pillay advised the Tribunal that Mr B Woollacott, who had the conduct of the
matter, was on his way to the Australian Capital Territory
to conduct a matter
before the High Court of Australia and that he had been instructed that the
legal practitioner had not received
the Notice of Hearing.
2005 the hearing was adjourned and costs of that day were reserved. Today, an
application for costs of 7 March 2005 has
been made on behalf of the
Sworn evidence was received from Mr William James Keough, the
legal practitioner now acting on behalf of the client in this matter.
Keough’s evidence was that he had several telephone conversations with Mr
A Grech of the legal practitioner’s office,
the first of which took place
in November 2004, during which Mr Grech acknowledged receipt of Particulars of
the dispute and the
possibility of a settlement of the dispute was discussed.
Mr Keough further gave evidence that on 14 December 2004 he had another
telephone conversation with Mr Grech and that Mr Grech mentioned
hearing date.
The March hearing date was published to the parties by a
Notice of Hearing, dated 7 December 2004, and the Tribunal file discloses
the Notice of Hearing was sent to the parties on that date.
circumstances, I must conclude that the legal practitioner did in fact have
notice of the hearing for 7 March 2005.
I might also make the
observation that I offered the opportunity to Mr Pillay to call evidence in
rebuttal of Mr Keough’s evidence
and that that offer was
Section 134 of the
Legal Practice Act 1996
circumstances under which costs may be awarded in this Tribunal. The starting
point is that each party is to bear their
own costs. However, sub-section 2 of
section 134 states:
“(2) If the Tribunal considers that a party to a dispute has behaved
unreasonably in relation to the hearing, the Tribunal
may make an order that the
party pay all or a specified part of the costs of the hearing of the other party
or of the Tribunal, or
Given that I have sworn evidence which
satisfies me that the legal practitioner did in fact have the Notice of Hearing
prior to the
hearing day of 7 March 2005 and given that there was no appearance
by the legal practitioner, although Mr Pillay did attend and request
adjournment, I come to the conclusion that the legal practitioner’s
actions were indeed unreasonable.
Under the circumstances, I order that
the legal practitioner is to pay to the client his costs of 7 March 2005 which I
sum of $1,850.00.
In relation to the dispute itself, it is
ordered, with the consent of the legal practitioner and the consent of the
client, that the
legal practitioner is to pay to the client the sum of
$15,000.00.
In all other respects the dispute is
