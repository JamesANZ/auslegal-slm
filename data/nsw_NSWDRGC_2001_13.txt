1. The Court is conducting a hearing to determine
whether the applicant before the Court is eligible to enter a Drug Court
That is a decision which is envisaged by the provisions of
Drug Court Act 1998
. The Court will also determine whether, having regard to the
applicant's antecedents, it would be appropriate for the person to participate
in a program under this Act, as well as exercising the general discretion that
the Court has in
2. Objection has been taken to the admissibility
of the statements prepared for this hearing by police officers who are to give
evidence together with a number of annexures to those statements, and a
transcript of a Supreme Court bail application made by this
applicant. This is
evidence which may not be admissible in a criminal trial because of hearsay and
relevance provisions of the
Evidence Act 1995
. The Crown argues that the
provisions of
Drug Court Act 1998
entitles the Court to consider the
material. That section provides
26. Court proceedings
(1) This section applies to proceedings before the Drug Court in
the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act, but does not apply
proceedings before the Drug Court in the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction
of the District Court or the criminal jurisdiction
of a Local Court.
(2) Proceedings before the Drug Court are to be conducted:
(a) in accordance with the directions of the Judge presiding in the
proceedings, and
(b) subject to paragraph (a), with as little formality and technicality, and
with as much expedition, as the requirements of this
Act and the regulations and
the proper consideration of the matters before the Court permit.
(3) The Drug Court is not bound by the rules of
evidence, but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it considers
appropriate.
3. The section applies to
proceedings before the Drug Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the
Act. It does not apply to
proceedings before the Drug Court in the exercise of
the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court, or the criminal jurisdiction
a Local Court. Quite clearly, I am not exercising either of those jurisdictions
today. I am making no finding of guilt; that is
not the question that comes
before me to determine. This is an unusual inquiry and it certainly is not a
4. It is not unusual for hearings of this nature to be conducted
in conjunction with criminal proceedings and I refer specifically
Bail Act 1978
where the Court there is given some unusual and different
powers of being able to take into account evidence or information which
Court considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances. So elsewhere
within the system of dealing with matters associated
with criminal cases it is
recognised that there will be different methods of conducting hearings.
5. It is the practice of the Drug Court to allow the Director of Public
Prosecutions to present information, to allow the representatives
applicant or the drug offender, should he or she become one, the right to
challenge and test that information, and that opportunity
will again be allowed
today. Quite clearly and without doubt, this is a proceeding in the exercise of
Drug Court Act 1998
and not in the exercise of any
District Court or Local Court jurisdiction. I have no doubt that it was intended
by the legislation
of the Act would apply to proceedings of this
nature. I am therefore of the view that proceedings are to be conducted in
with the directions that I give today and, of course, that also takes
into account the practices that have been established by the
Court in the past.
I am not bound by the rules of evidence and may inform myself of any matter that
I consider appropriate.
6. The second point I think I need to make in
relation to an inquiry of this nature, and the evidence that I receive, is to
acknowledge
that the effect of the decision is irrevocable in that it will not
be a decision which can be appealed (Drug Court Act 1998 s7(5)).
This reinforces
the need for the Court to proceed with fairness in every respect to every
person. In deciding whether it is appropriate
and whether to exercise the
discretion under s7(2), there are a number of considerations, but it is my view
that although the
Drug Court Act
is beneficial legislation (R v Sloane
, one of the considerations the Court at all stages must have is that
the purpose of the Court is, after all, to protect the community.
reason offences of violent conduct are excluded by the provisions of
that underlies the nature of the inquiry made by
as well. For that reason,
whilst I cannot disregard the obvious principles of fairness contained within
Evidence Act 1995
, it encourages me to hear what information people have to
submit to the Court to make sure that any decision I make is fair to the
community as well as fair to the offender.
7. For those reasons and
allowing, of course, right to challenge and if necessary, question the evidence
of the officers, I propose
to allow the documents that are sought to be tendered
to be placed before the Court. Until I have heard from the witnesses I will
refrain from reading those statements which will form, as I understand it, the
background to the evidence that the prosecution seeks
to call from the officers.
So far as the transcript of the Supreme Court on the applicant's bail
application in which the applicant
gave evidence in relation to the offences
before this court today, it is patently relevant and important to any decision
that I have
to make that I consider what was said there.
