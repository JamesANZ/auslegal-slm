APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
REASONS FOR DECISION
and Mrs Savage seek leave to appeal and to appeal a decision of the Tribunal
made on 23 January 2023.
[2] Mr and Mrs
Savage do not take issue with any of the findings of the Tribunal below, except
in relation to the calculation of painting
charges and the resultant terms of
the final order.
Tribunal decision
Tribunal ordered on 23 January 2023 that Mr and Mrs Savage must pay Retloub Pty
Ltd ATF The Boulter Building Trust t/as Boulter
Built Homes (‘the
Builder’) the sum of $8,805.06 by 10 March 2023.
[4] That sum was
awarded after the Member found that the Builder was entitled to payment for a
final progress claim, adjusted by the
sums found in Mr and Mrs Savage’s
favour, as follows:
$12,644.00 final progress claim, less:
(a) overcharge on painting $1,088.44
(b) steel beam incorrectly charged $1,005.00
(c) costs to rectify painting works
Total to the Builder $8,805.56
[5] Relevant
facts on which the Tribunal proceeded include:
(a) On 5 November 2019 the parties agreed in writing to remove external painting
from the scope of works and adjusted the costs of
that work by deducting the
cost of external painting from the previously quoted amount of $17,600.00,
leaving an amount allowed for
painting of $11,257.00.
(b) The parties entered into an HIA Queensland Alteration, Addition and
Renovation Contract (QC3) (‘the Contract’) on
11 November 2019.
(c) The contract price is described in cl 2 of the Contract as $216,743.00
including GST, comprising a fixed price component of $149,938.60,
allowances of $20,196.40 and a provisional sum allowance of $46,608.00.
(d) Provisional sums set out in sch 3 to the Contract include as an item MLG
Painting at $17,600.00, which is the amount quoted by
MLG on 8 September 2019 to
include external and internal painting. In all, the provisional sum allowances
amount to $46,608.00.
(e) Clause 21 of the Contract provides that if the actual price of a provisional
sum item is less than the allowance, the difference
will be deducted from the
contract price. Any extra cost is added to the contract price with a margin.
(f) Schedule 4 (cl 22) provides that external painting is not included in the
contract price because Mr and Mrs Savage are either
supplying these items or
having other contractors do the work.
[6] The Building
Schedule forming part of the Contract includes the note:
“35. Painting
– internal painting by builder, external painting by owner, “other
– as per MLG Quote No 288
dated 8 September 2019.”
February 2020, the Builder sent a variations summary document to Mr and Mrs
Savage, which included:
MLG quote dated 12 Feb 2020
Less Allowance
Add margin 25% $1,046
Add GST 10% $523
variation amount was paid.
[9] A final
notice of dispute was issued by Mr and Ms Savage on 1 July 2020, with a claim of
$11,245.00 said to be owing to them comprising:
(a) $5,754.00 paid to the Builder following the painting variation of 18
February 2020; plus
(b) $5,491.00 credit which should have been given upon reduction of the
provisional sum of $17,600 allocated to painting.
[10] The Builder
gave two final payment claims. The first for $11,219.00 being the final contract
amount of $10,732.00 adjusted for
variations and the second with different
adjustments in the amount of $12,644.00. Neither claim referenced any adjustment
for painting.
[11] The Member
accepted it was agreed that to reduce cost Mr and Mrs Savage would be
responsible for external painting and the Builder
for internal painting as part
of the Contract, with a provisional allowance made for that. The Member found
that the contract price
was reduced accordingly.
[12] The Member
accepted the Builder’s submission that the Contract should be rectified
because of the Builder’s error
in including a provisional sum for painting
of $17,600.00 and that Mr and Mrs Savage were aware of the error.
[13] The Member
found that Mr and Mrs Savage were aware that inclusion of a provisional sum of
$17,600.00 for painting was an error
because a new estimated painting cost had
been agreed before entering the Contract. It was reasoned that failing to adjust
the provisional
sum allowance to reflect the internal painting cost only would
have the impact of the homeowners paying $6,377.87 (plus builder’s
for painting, but receiving a credit back of $17,600.00 – namely, free
internal painting plus an $11,000.00 windfall.
It was found that the
parties’ intention was that the provisional sum allowance for painting
would reflect the estimated internal
painting costs, based upon the MLG quote
received, as the MLG quote is referenced in the schedule of provisional sum
allowances.
[14] The Member
adopted the Builder’s figures, save for the provisional sum allowance, and
calculated the correct painting charges
as follows:
MLG quote 310 ex
GST $12,109.00
Less provisional sum allowance
for internal painting (per MLG quote 288)
for internal painting plus GST - $6,383.87
Plus equipment hire - $2,332.00
Plus Builder’s margin 25%
Plus GST 10%
Less amount claimed
Overcharge to be credited
Grounds of appeal
and Mrs Savage have attempted to characterise the errors they assert occurred in
the decision below. With respect I do not
consider a correct characterisation
has been made.
[16] In my view
Mr and Mrs Savage assert errors of law, errors of fact and errors of mixed law
Section 146
Queensland Civil and
Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(Qld) (‘QCAT Act’) applies to
questions of law. No leave to appeal is required where a question of law alone
As to questions of fact and mixed law and fact, s 147 of the QCAT Act
requires that leave to appeal be granted before a decision
in the appeal may be
made. Under s147 of the QCAT Act the appeal proceeds by way of rehearing on the
evidence before the Member below.
[17] Leave to
appeal is granted if there is a reasonably arguable case of error and of
substantial injustice if the error is not corrected.
[18] In this
case where questions of law, fact and mixed law and fact can be discerned the
Appeal Tribunal will determine if leave
to appeal should be granted with respect
to the questions of fact, and law and fact. If leave to appeal is granted the
matter will
proceed by way of a rehearing.
[19] I will
then deal with all asserted errors in the appeal
proceeding.
Submissions of Mr and Mrs Savage
Ground 1 - There was no mistake in the provisional sum
allocated for painting.
and Mrs Savage deny that there was any mistake in inserting the sum of
$17,600.00 as a provisional sum for painting in the
contract. I take that
submission to raise a question of fact as to whether a relevant mistake is
established on the facts, and a
question of law as to whether rectification of
the contract should have been granted. The ground of appeal raises a question of
law and fact.
Ground 2 - Failure to take email
correspondence between the parties into account in construing the
[21] This ground
of appeal is part and parcel of the question of mixed fact and law as to whether
there was a mistake sufficient to
justify rectification of the Contract. Mr and
Mrs Savage submit that the Member relied on the 5 November 2019 email to find
there had been a mistake in recording the terms of the contract with
respect to the allocation of a provisional sum for painting.
[22] They say
that the Member failed to take account of the subsequent email of 10 November
2019 wherein the Builder requested that
the provisional sum for painting be left
at $17,600.00, noting the changed scope of works, so that the contract terms in
to reducing the contract sum upon only internal painting being
performed would govern the ultimate cost of the work. Mr and Mrs Savage
they agreed to sign the contract on that basis.
[23] Mr and Mrs
Savage also refer to emails written after the contract was entered, on 23
January and 18 February 2020 which they
assert are evidence consistent with
there being no mistake, but those emails were not taken into account by the
[24] A failure
to take into account a relevant matter or taking into account an irrelevant
matter is an error of law.
Ground 3 - Incorrect calculation of money owed under the
and Mrs Savage submit that an incorrect calculation of the money owed under the
contract occurred because of an erroneous
finding as to the amount of the
provisional sum for painting in the contract.
ground raises a question of law as to the meaning of the
Once the contract has
been construed a question of fact is raised as to the correct calculation of
money owing under the contract.
[27] Mr and Mrs
Savage submit that they are entitled to a refund of the sum of $5,754.00 paid by
way of the variation dated 3 March
2020 because the variation incorrectly cited
a provisional sum for painting of $7,924.00, not $17,600.00. Further a credit of
is claimed against the provisional sum of $17,600.00 given the
painting cost was $13,319.37.
[28] Mr and Mrs
Savage say that the sum owed to them is $10,034.89 which they ask be offset
against the $1,088.44 awarded to them,
leaving them due $8,946.45 as a credit
for painting works. They then seek to offset that amount against the amount
awarded to the
Builder in an amount of $8,805.06 so that the Builder must pay
the Savages $141.39.
Builder’s submissions
Builder says that the agreed price for the contract works was $215,000.00
(inclusive of GST) once external painting work
was removed from the scope of
work. The Builder says that the painting allowance reflected in that contract
price was $8,715.87 (inclusive
of GST) or $7,923.52 (exclusive of GST). Taking
account of some smaller items the contract price was then finalised at
$216,743.00.
[30] The Builder
submits that for the Savages’ argument to carry any weight cl 22 of the
Contract (Excluded items) would need
to be “rescinded” and
“signed by both parties”.
Reply by Mr and Mrs Savage
reply, Mr and Mrs Savage say that if the contract price of $216,743.00 included
a lesser provisional sum for painting the
total contract price would be less
than $216,743.00. They say that the fixed and prime components have not changed
and are not in
dispute. They point out that the addition of the fixed price
component, prime cost allowances and provisional sum allowance (including
painting allowance of $17,600.00) total the contract price of
$216,743.00.
Consideration
Grounds 1 and 2 – there was no mistake in the provisional
sum or the contract price as set out in the contract which would justify
rectification; the Member failed to take into account relevant evidence in
finding a mistake.
question raised by these grounds is whether the Member was in error by
purporting to rectify the contract. Further, was the
Member in error by relying
on the 5 November 2019 email and ignoring the 10 November 2019 email between the
parties to determine
if there had been a mistake sufficient to justify
rectification.
[33] Although
not raised by either party a question of jurisdiction arises which the Appeal
Tribunal is bound to address. Does the
Tribunal have the power to order
rectification? The powers of the Tribunal to resolve building disputes are found
Queensland Building and
Construction Commission Act
(Qld) (‘QBCC Act’). No
express power to order rectification is given to the Tribunal. The decision of
’) considered the issue and concluded that although s
77(3)(e) of the QBCC Act includes a power to vary a contract to avoid
that does not include a power to order rectification of a contract. On this view
the Member erred in law by mistaking her
question of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this regard is not free from
doubt. There is authority which suggests that
the power to vary in s 77(3)(e) is
in the nature of rectification.
Further it has been said that the Tribunal’s powers under s 77 are
extensive and broad ranging.
seems to me that the Member resolved the proper basis for rectification by
relying on the imperative in s 28 of the QCAT Act to
act fairly according to the
substantial merits of the
[35] For the
reasons given in
I do not consider the Tribunal has power to order
rectification of a building contract. An error as to jurisdiction is an error of
law which I find has occurred. The result is that under s 146 of the QCAT Act
the Appeal Tribunal may substitute its own decision
for that of the Member below
that the Contract is not amenable to
rectification.
[36] Even if the
Tribunal does have the power to rectify a contract, I do not consider that the
grounds exist in this matter for such
an order, for the reasons which
[37] The usual
rule is that parties who sign a written contract are bound by its
and extrinsic evidence of
the parties’ actual intentions and expectations is
inadmissible,
circumstances exist for the contract to be
Because the Tribunal
was concerned with grounds for rectification the Member was entitled to look at
extrinsic evidence to determine
the parties’ intention, being the email
correspondence between the parties.
[38] The Member
correctly identified the circumstances in which rectification might be ordered
at common law.
However, the
Member did not say whether she considered rectification was necessary as a
result of common mistake or unilateral mistake.
Rectification is not a remedy by
which additional or different terms are imported into contracts. It is to
instruments so as to make them accord with what the
parties actually agreed to, or with what one party intended and the other party
knew the first intended.
[39] The Member
found as a basis for rectification that the parties were agreed external
painting would be removed from the contract,
they were agreed as to the price
for internal painting (albeit provisional) and that the contract price was
reduced to reflect reduced
painting costs. The Member found that Mr and Mrs
Savage would enjoy a windfall not intended by the parties if the contract did
reflect a provisional sum for internal painting, rather than a provisional
sum for both internal and external painting.
[40] The email
correspondence between the parties suggests that at the time of entering the
contract there was no mistake and that
they both intended to insert the sum of
$17,600.00 in the contract as the provisional sum for painting. The relevant
emails which
go to intention are the email of 10 November 2019, immediately
prior to signing of the contract and the two post contract emails
of 23 January
2020 and 18 February 2020.
[41] The Member
referred to the 5 November 2019 email in reaching her conclusion. She did not
take into account the 10 November 2019
email described earlier. The Member
raised two matters which counted against the Builder, namely that it drew up the
contract and
an email of 23 January 2020 confirming the provisional sum of
$17,600.00 for painting. Those latter matters appear not to have been
weight in forming a view that either a common or unilateral mistake had occurred
which justified rectification of the contract.
It has been held that clear and
convincing evidence is required to prove that the signed document does not give
effect to the parties’
[42] I do not
consider that the facts exist to justify a conclusion that there has been a
common mistake as to the amount of the provisional
sum allowance for painting.
[43] Nor do I
think the facts exist to justify a conclusion that the Builder made a mistake as
to the provisional sum allowance and
that the Builder’s mistake was
knowingly exploited by Mr and Mrs Savage.
reference to the intention of the parties set out in all the email
communications, I do not think the grounds existed for
rectification of the
contract in favour of the terms contended for by the Builder.
[45] I find that
the contract reflects the common intention of the parties that the contract
price would be adjusted by taking out
the cost of external painting from the
provisional sum for painting, at the point of adjustment in accordance with cl
21.7 of the
[46] If the
Tribunal has the power to grant rectification of a building contract, the Member
erred in finding that grounds existed
to grant rectification.
[47] Leave to
appeal is granted. This ground of appeal succeeds.
[48] If the
Tribunal has the power to grant rectification of a building contract, I conclude
consistent with the submissions by Mr
and Mrs Savage, that without considering
the 10 November 2019 email and without taking into account the other factors
by the Member, an error of law has occurred. This ground of appeal
[49] Relying on
both my conclusion as to the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction to rectify a
building contract and my conclusion
that if the Tribunal does have that
decision below
purporting to rectify the Contract is set aside. In substitution
is a decision that the Contract is not rectified but remains in
the form as
executed by the parties.
ground raises the proper interpretation of the Contract, and once that is
determined, the correct calculation of money owed
under the Contract.
[51] As to the
meaning of the Contract, the ordinary principles of construction of a contract
are used. That is, what would a reasonable
person think was intended by a term
or terms of a contract.
following clauses are relevant:
[53] Clause 2:
... The contract price is: $216,743.00
The contract price (inclusive of GST) is the sum of the following:
Fixed price component: $149,938.60
Prime Cost Allowances: $ 20,196.40
Provisional Sum Allowances: $ 46,608.00
The contract price is subject to change. The Clauses that allow for changes to
the contract price are Clauses...21...
[54] Clause
These documents are documents that form part of this contract and are in
addition to any special conditions, these general conditions,
the specifications
and the plans.
1...Quote MLG Painting Quote...
[55] Clause
21.7 In relation to each ... provisional sum item if the actual price of
supplying the item or providing the work is:
(a) less than the allowance, the difference is deducted from the contract
(b) more than the allowance, the total of the difference plus the relevant
margin on excess state in Schedule 3 or a schedule forming
part of this contract
applied to the difference is added to the contract price.
[56] Clause
22.1 The owner and the building contractor agree that the materials, goods,
labour and services shown in the contract documents and
which are set out in
Schedule 4 are excluded from the works and the cost of those items are not
included in the contract price.
Schedule 3 Provisional Sum items
...MLG Painting and Decorating Quote $17,600
Total: $46,608.00
Schedule 4: Excluded Items
The owner acknowledges that the cost of the supply and/or installation of
materials, goods or the provision of the labour or services
that are listed
below are not included in the contract price. The owner may be supplying these
items or having other contractors
do the work.
... external painting
[57] If the
provisional sum allowed for painting includes the cost of both external and
internal painting, confusion arises as to
the meaning of cl 22. On the
Builder’s submissions the clause means that an amount for external
painting has already been removed
from the contract price. That is what the
Member accepted. On one reading that may be what the clause means. However, that
is not consistent with clause 2 whereby the contract sum specifically
includes a provisional sum which catches the cost of external
painting. Nor is
it consistent with cl 16 and sch 3.
[58] The other
meaning to be attributed to cl 22 is consistent with the submissions of Mr and
Mrs Savage that external painting is
not to be included in the contract price
and insofar as the provisional sum allowance includes an amount for external
painting that
will be adjusted out of the contract sum when the actual cost of
internal painting is known. That is consistent with cl 2 and the
warning that the contract price is subject to change as a result of cl 21.
[59] I conclude
that reading the contract as a whole and giving meaning to cl 2 and cl 21.7, cl
22 means that the cost of external
painting is not included in the contract
when adjusted
[60] That is an
interpretation which a reasonable person would have understood those terms to
mean. The subjective intentions of the
parties are irrelevant in interpreting
the contract.
[61] On this
basis, I find that the provisional sum for painting is $17,600, and the contract
price is $216,743, as set out in the
Contract. The Contract remains unaltered at
[62] To the
extent that the Member below has not correctly interpreted the Contract, this
ground of appeal succeeds.
calculation of money owing under the Contract the calculations of the Builder
adopted by the Member are misleading. Those
calculations treat painting as a
variation rather than an item of work agreed to be performed for a sum allowed
at a provisional
amount, later adjusted to $13,319.89 and then reflected in the
contract price. The Builder uses the term variation to refer to adjustments
to the contract price, but it is clear those items of work are not variations in
the sense provided for at cl 20 of the Contract.
I consider the Member was in
error to adopt the mode of calculation undertaken.
construction of the Contract the progress payment issued after painting had been
completed should have taken account of
the reduced contract price following an
adjustment on removal of external painting. Schedule 2 of the Contract which
relates to progress
payments provides that the total of all progress payments
must equal the contract price stated in item 2. That is the contract price
in cl 2, as adjusted by reference to cl 21.
[65] Mr and Mrs
Savage have paid the sum of $5,754.00 towards painting costs as a result of a
“variation” having been
issued. It appears they have also paid the
sum of $13,319.89 for painting. The parties are agreed that in all they have
paid $213,784
to the Builder.
preparation of this decision I was unable to calculate what the final progress
claim should be, given actual variations which
might affect the contract price
and other adjustments which should have been made upon crystallisation of
costings for other provisional
sum items. For that reason, I sought further
submissions from both parties.
[67] I required
the Builder to file further submissions setting out:
(a) the contract sum adjusted by:
(i) variations stating what variations and the amount by which the contract sum
is increased or decreased;
(ii) the difference between any provisional sum and the actual cost of a
provisional sum item in accordance with clause 21.7(a) or
(b) payments made by Mr and Mrs Savage;
(c) the balance owing by reference to the adjusted contract sum.
[68] I have
received submissions from Mr and Mrs Savage in response.
[69] The point
of difference in the approaches of the Builder and Mr and Mrs Savage is whether
the starting point for adjusting the
contract price to take account of the
actual cost of painting includes the provisional sum of $17,600.
[70] The Builder
excludes that sum from the contract price and uses an amount calculated by
removing the costs of exterior painting
from the 8 September 2019 quote -
$8,716.00. Mr and Mrs Savage include the original provisional sum of $17,600.00.
I have found that
Mr and Mrs Savage are correct in their interpretation of the
[71] That being
the case I consider the following calculation represents the amount owing by Mr
and Mrs Savage under the Contract.
I have used the information given to me by
the Builder, noting that he uses the term “variation”, but is
referring to
the adjusted provisional sum for items of work in sch 3 of the
Contract. In undertaking my calculation, I have excluded all reference
painting until a final adjustment is made.
Contract price:
$216,743.00
Plus variation 1 (excluding
($7,773 less $5,754 for painting)
Plus variation 2 ($3,252)
$222,014.00
Less difference between provisional cost
for painting and actual cost
($17,600 less $13,319)
Adjusted contract price
$217,733.00
Less total amount paid by Savages
$213,784.00
[72] By way of a
check of those calculations, I note the submission of Mr and Mrs Savage that
neither the fixed price component of
the contract price nor the prime cost items
have altered. That was not challenged by the Builder. On that basis the sum of
price component, the prime cost items and the actual cost of the
provisional items should add up to the adjusted contract price of
$217,733.00.
Using the variation figures given by the Builder the actual cost of the
provisional items is:
Plus variation 1 (excluding painting) $2,019.00
Plus variation 2 $3,252.00
Less $4,281.00
(difference between provisional sum for
painting of $17,600 and actual cost
of $13,319.00)
Total adjusted provisional sum: $47,598.00
The sum of $149,938.60 fixed price, plus $20,196.40 prime cost items, plus
$47,598 adjusted actual cost of provisional items equals
$217,733.00 being the
adjusted contract price.
[73] I find upon
a rehearing conducted under s 147 of the QCAT Act that Mr and Mrs Savage owe the
Builder the sum of $3,949.00. However,
that sum should be adjusted in their
favour to take account of $2,750.50 for the following amounts found by the
Member and not challenged
by either party:
(a) $1,005.00 for a steel beam incorrectly charged, and
(b) $1,745.50 costs to rectify painting.
[74] The result
is an amount of $1,198.50 owed by Mr and Mrs Savage to the Builder.
[75] The Member
found an overcharge in relation to painting of $1,088.44 which had been offset
in her calculations. I have not offset
that amount because it has been counted
in reduction of the contract price in the money paid by Mr and Mrs Savage.
[76] To the
extent payment has been made by Mr and Mrs Savage of the amount originally
ordered to be paid in an amount of $8,805.06
that sum must be repaid to Mr and
Mrs Savage.
