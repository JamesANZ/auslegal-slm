the husband pay the wife’s costs of this application with such sum to be
determined and met from the sale proceeds the
husband would receive pursuant to
order 3 herein.
4 The parties commenced their relationship at
Christmas time in 1998. They were married on 22 May 1999. They purchased their
house being [Property P] in July 2002. Their child, [Child A], was born
[in] 2003 and their child, [Child B], was born [in] 2005.
They separated in
July 2009 and were therefore together for approximately 10½ years. They
were divorced in September 2014.
Property settlement law
5 The parties were married so the provisions of the
Family Law Act
Section 79(1)
of the Act provides that the Court must make such orders as
it considers appropriate.
provides that “the Court shall not make
an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the
circumstances, it
is just and equitable to make the order”.
8 Traditionally that has meant that the Court followed a fourstage process.
9 That process is as follows:
(a) identify the value of the assets and liabilities of the parties;
(b) assess the contributions made by each party to the assets;
(c) assess the factors set out in
(d) consider whether the proposed orders are just and equitable between the
10 The fourth step of this process was seen to be the
check required pursuant to
to only make an order if it was just and
equitable to do so.
11 The High Court examined these provisions in
Stanford v Stanford
(2012) 247 CLR 108.
12 The High Court noted at [36-40] that when exercising the property
settlement power, three fundamental propositions must not be
(a) One must first identify, according to common law and equitable principles,
legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property
[emphasis added];
(b) The Court’s power must be exercised in accordance with legal
principles; and
(c) To conclude that making an order is “just and equitable” only
because of reference to the various matters set out
separately considering
, would be to “
conflate the statutory
requirements and ignore the principles laid down by the
13 The Court also held that the mere fact of
separation is not necessarily enough to warrant exercising the property
settlement power
and making an order.
14 The power under
is to alter a party’s interest in
property, which is why the High Court considered it is essential to begin with
an examination
of what interests in property the parties have. It may or may
not be necessary to alter any such interests.
15 The High Court at [42] acknowledged the reality that in many cases, the
“just and equitable” requirement is:
... readily satisfied by observing that, as a result of a choice made by one or
both of the parties, the husband and wife are no
longer living in a marital
relationship. It will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order
in such a case because
there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of
property by the husband and wife.
16 In the event that the
Court decides that
demands that an order be made, then the Court
must make such orders as it considers appropriate. It must also take into
the provisions of
17 The parties’ assets and debts are set out in the table below.
[Property P]
$925,000.00
Debt – loan to wife’s father with interest as at 15/7/15
-$238,108.00
Debt - anticipated selling costs
-$20,000.00
Bank account
Superannuation
[Citroen] vehicle
Husband (in wife’s possession)
$766,062.00
18 The Court is able to treat superannuation as if it was an asset. In the
circumstances I will include the superannuation in the
asset schedule as the
wife has done in her Papers for the Judicial Officer.
Loan to applicant’s father
19 The applicant’s father says that he lent
money to the applicant to be repaid and was very clear on that condition. He
that he paid $20,141.00 by way of mortgage repayments on Property P
together with other expenses and amounts by way of cash from
time to time.
20 He was clear that he told the applicant that he did not expect interest
to be added to those amounts set out above.
21 On 17 November 2010 (after separation) the applicant’s father paid
the amount of $165,084.95 to the parties’ Police
and Nurses loan account.
This payment discharged the joint mortgage over Property P. The
applicant’s father was clear that
he expected that amount to be repaid
with interest at 7%. His condition was that the amount be repaid when the
house was sold.
Those terms were agreed by the applicant. It is therefore
appropriate that the applicant seeks orders for the sale of the property
her father may be repaid.
22 I accept that the abovementioned liability to the applicant’s
father is a legitimate one and I accept the basis of the calculation
Is it just and equitable to make an order?
23 It is just and equitable to make an order for
property settlement. The parties no longer have the joint enjoyment of Property
P and given the husband’s lack of involvement in these proceedings it has
not been possible to finalise that interest. It
would be inequitable to allow
the parties to retain their joint interests in that property.
Contributions and history
24 Neither party had any assets of any significance
at the start of their relationship.
25 At the start of their relationship the respondent was employed as a
[Physiotherpist] on a fulltime basis earning approximately
$45,000.00 per annum.
In January 1999 the wife started fulltime study at Murdoch University.
26 The wife finished her [teaching] degree in 2002. She started working as
[a relief teacher] in July 2002 earning approximately
$50,000.00 per annum. She
[commenced full-time teaching] in February 2004. The parties repaid a loan to
the applicant’s father
for the applicant’s studies. During the
course of her employment her wage increased to approximately $100,000.00. After
children were born the husband initially stayed home on a fulltime basis.
In April 2006 the parties swapped roles where the applicant
ceased work and
stayed at home caring for the children and the respondent took up a fulltime
position as a physiotherapist in [Coastal
27 According to the applicant’s evidence that change in arrangements
did not work out and the parties then moved to [Coastal
Town N] in late
28 The wife recommenced part-time work as a solicitor in July 2007 and was
working four days per week. She stopped that work in
November 2008.
29 In 2009, she started relief teaching, given the flexibility and working
hours assisted with the care of two young children.
30 At that time the husband was working one day per week as a
physiotherapist. In May 2009 the wife commenced fulltime teaching
approximately $78,000.00 per annum. In July 2009 the parties separated.
31 Post separation the wife’s father paid out the mortgage so that she
could live in Property P without having to contribute
to mortgage
repayments.
32 Property P was purchased on 29 July 2002 for $365,000.00. The wife
accepts that the parties equally contributed to that initial
purchase and there
was an initial mortgage of $250,000.00.
33 The wife says that contribution should be assessed on a 60%/40% basis in
her favour. Given the contributions to the welfare of
the family and
contributions by way of income I consider this is an appropriate apportionment
(in particular taking into account
the contributions to that property after
separation). The wife paid for a number of renovations to the property
that may well have
increased the value of the property. I have not taken into
account (as I have been careful to not double count) the amount provided
parties by the wife’s father. Those amounts cannot be classified as
contributions because they form a legitimate debt
which will be repaid.
Section 75(2)
34 The current child support assessment is for a
period 1 August 2014 to 31 October 2015. The husband’s taxable
described at $22,919.00. The wife has been assessed as having 100%
care of the children. The annual rate of child support payable
by the husband
to the wife is $399.00. This is an extremely low level of child support and
goes nowhere near covering the expenses
for the children. In particular
the education expenses alone for the two children are significantly higher than
the husband’s
overall child support liability. Child A attends [Private
School A] and is in year 6. The combination of her tuition fees and other
school related expenses amounts to over $10,000 per annum. Child B attends
[Private School B] and is in year 4. His fees were approximately
$5,000.00 (not
take into account extra expenses such as uniforms, excursions and books).
35 To the best of the wife’s knowledge the husband still works one day
a week at the [Coastal Town N Physiotherapy Clinic]
and does relief work at the
[Coastal Town G Physiotherapy Clinic].
36 The wife now works fulltime at [M School] earning $103,600.00 per
37 She contends that an apportionment of 20% in her favour is appropriate
given the abovementioned factors. The wife has a reasonable
income but given
the children are both attending private schools, there will be significant
expenses paid by her in order to ensure
that they continue attending such
schools. The husband is unlikely to contribute to any significant extent to
those costs or to
the ongoing everyday costs of supporting two children. Given
that the husband has presented no evidence whatsoever as to his income
only figure that is available on the evidence is that mentioned in the child
support documents, I am not prepared to be generous
to the husband. He clearly
has a significant earning capacity having earned reasonable income in the past
when working on a fulltime
basis. It may be that he has chosen to work on a
parttime basis for some reason, but the effect of that choice is that he has
the children of a proper level of child support. That responsibility
has therefore been sheeted home to the wife almost exclusively.
38 In all those circumstances, I accept that an apportionment of 20% in the
wife’s favour is appropriate.
39 On an overall basis that means the wife is entitled to 80% of the
abovementioned assets. That figure amounts to $612,850. This
includes her
superannuation.
40 That would leave the husband with the amount of $153,212 (20%), together
with any other assets that he may have in his possession.
The wife has no
knowledge of any further assets. It may well be that he owns other assets such
as a car, boat, furniture etc.
41 In 2002, the husband and wife each contributed approximately $57,000 to
the purchase costs of Property P. The net proceeds of
sale from that property
will be about $666,892 (if the property sells for $925,000 and the wife’s
father is subsequently repaid).
The husband is entitled to an overall amount of
$153,212. That amount is approximately 23% of the above anticipated net sale
I should fix a percentage of the net proceeds to go to each party in
order to fairly take into account the potential that the property
might sell for
a higher or lower price than has been set out in these reasons.
42 Once the property is sold and the costs and the wife’s father have
been repaid, the husband should receive 23% of the net
sale proceeds and the
wife will then receive 77% of the net sale proceeds.
Are the proposed orders just and equitable?
43 The orders sought by the wife provide that she
be the sole trustee for sale of the property. I accept that this order is
appropriate.
It also provides for her father to be repaid together with
interest. I accept that is a reasonable order also. The amount that
will receive in my view is a just and equitable outcome and the form of the
orders represent a just and equitable outcome.
44 In all the circumstances therefore I intend to pronounce orders generally
pursuant to the wife’s minute filed on 26 June
2015. I will otherwise
hear from counsel for the wife in relation to the issue of costs given that that
has been claimed in the
final orders sought.
[Property P] be immediately marketed for sale with the wife to nominate the real
estate agent to effect the sale.
