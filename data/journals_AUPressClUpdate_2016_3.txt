Press Council Chair receives honorary degree from
Macquarie University
The Chair of the Australian Press Council, Professor David Weisbrot AM, has
been awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters
(D Litt) by Macquarie
University, recognising his contributions to law reform, especially in relation
to health and medical research.
Professor Weisbrot became Chair of the Press Council in March 2015. He is a
former Professor of Law and Governance at Macquarie University.
The Macquarie citation for the honorary degree notes in part:
"...David Weisbrot has had an illustrious career in law, spanning many
countries, branches of the profession and multiple fields of
"Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Law, he is a Commissioner of
the New South Wales Law Reform Commission and Emeritus
Professor of Law and
Honorary Professorial Fellow in Medicine at the University of Sydney. His
previous academic roles include serving
as Dean of two major law schools and
Adjunct Professor of Law and Governance at Macquarie University Law School.
"Professor Weisbrot rose to public prominence as the longest serving
President of the Australian Law Reform Commission. During his
ten-year stint at
the Commission from 1999 to 2009, he chaired 15 major inquiries. These included
the landmark Attorney-General's
National Task Force on Pro Bono Legal Services
and reviews into the federal civil justice system, privacy and secrecy
Professor Weisbrot said:
"I am deeply honoured to be awarded an honorary doctorate by Macquarie
University, because my experience as a law professor and a
law reformer
confirmed this University's very special commitment to the welfare and
intellectual development of its students, as
well as to innovative teaching and
scholarship by its academic staff - and all of this without losing its
historical focus on social
Since becoming Chair of the Press Council, Professor Weisbrot has taken steps
to alter the scope of the organisation, emphasising
that maintaining high
standards of practice is a shared enterprise with its publisher members, and
seeking to expand Council membership
to the growing online media space and to
Australia's multicultural press. As well, he has spoken out strongly against
measures which
diminish the ability of journalists to do their work, including
the government's metadata retention legislation, the diminishing
of Freedom of
Information rights and the current state of defamation laws.
