LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES:

S. Healy, Legal Aid Commission (NSW)
1. The submissions which have been made by the
prosecution opposing the entry of the offender to a Drug Court program, and the
of the police officers which those submissions support go right to the
heart of the Drug Court process. The very nature of a Drug
Court program is that
people who are highly likely to go to prison are going to be released into the
community. This will inevitably
pose some risk which the court, by its
supervision and by the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and by
keeping people
in treatment, is to try to minimise or eliminate. This process is
directed substantially towards rehabilitation and stopping people
again, rather than punishment. By the legislation, the Parliament is saying that
the community is, to some extent, prepared
to forego the need for people to
suffer punishment which they deserve or which would be appropriate to deter
other offenders, if
they enter into and are successful in a rehabilitation
2. Almost all of the arguments that have been raised so far as
the offender is concerned, can be raised in respect of many of his
predecessors
who have applied for entry to the Drug Court. The fact that he consistently
disobeys court orders and conditional liberty
is a very common instance. There
are many people on Drug Court programs who have committed offences in breach of
parole and the Parole
Board has allowed them to stay on a Drug Court program.
What could be a greater breach of conditions of conditional liberty? That
no mean that Mr Sheedy’s behaviour in any way is accepted as being
appropriate or not worthy of condemnation or even punishment
but it certainly
does not distinguish him from other Drug Court participants. It has been argued
that he has been untruthful in the
past. To apply a standard of honesty to Drug
Court program applicants would eliminate almost all, either before or after
their enter
into a Drug Court program.
3. The fact that his offences show
signs of organised crime distinguishes him from many others. From the reading of
the facts his
offences show a degree of planning, of organisation, of intent to
make major profit from crime as opposed to merely support a drug
habit. Many in
the community would say that people who break into private homes and steal the
jewellery or those irreplaceable keepsakes
from generations past are far more of
a concern than those who steal container loads of toys from commercial
enterprises. Again,
it does not mean that the large organised crime is not very
serious and not deserving of punishment but the risk the Drug Court takes
allowing people who do housebreakings to remain in the community can be very
great, yet the Court often knowingly takes those
4. His driving
record is also of concern. There have been eight occasions between 1997 and 2001
when Mr Sheedy has driven when disqualified
by a Court and five further
occasions when driving whilst unlicensed. There was a dangerous driving offence
in 1996 about which I
know nothing so far as the details. There are two careless
driving offences in Victoria, which I understand that to be akin to negligent
driving in New South Wales as opposed to the more serious driving in a manner
dangerous. Then there is the offence on 3 October 2001
which was dangerous in
every respect. It is consistent with the manner of driving described on the last
occasion that it was an amphetamine
induced attempt to evade apprehension rather
than some of those others the court has considered where there have been
repeated events,
where stolen cars are taken and crashed, regardless of the
consequences to the passengers or property.
5. Of course this record is
of concern. However, despite the existence of this variety of risk factors, it
is not my view that the
risks this man poses to the community from serious
offences that involve physical harm, significant property loss or damage is
than many other people who are already on the program. It certainly will
be the case that if he is on a Drug Court program he will
need to be very
closely watched and he will be strongly warned about the consequences. But it a
case of balancing the risk. Another
factor that suggests to me that he is not an
inappropriate person to enter a Drug Court program is the relative shortness of
criminal history, particularly so far as offences of dishonesty is
concerned. It is not a lifetime of crime and if we can stop it
now, perhaps we
can stop it forever. The alternative may be to give the opportunity and perhaps
even the encouragement by long gaol
sentences to continue forever in a life of
6. I am satisfied that the several criteria for eligibility exist.
I have previously found on the balance of probabilities that Mr
Sheedy is a drug
dependent person, and I accept that he lives within the region of the Drug
Court, and that he is highly likely to
receive a prison sentence for the
offences to which he has pleaded or will plead guilty which are or are coming to
the Court and
that those offences are not excluded from this Court's
appropriate for him to enter a Drug Court program.
