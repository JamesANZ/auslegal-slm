Undertaking
INTRODUCTION
Panel, Bruce McLennan (sitting President), Deborah Page AM and Kate Towey made a
declaration of unacceptable circumstances in
relation to the affairs of
Dropsuite. The application concerned a statement contained in an announcement by
Dropsuite that Topline
(Dropsuite’s largest shareholder) intended to vote
in favour of a proposed scheme pursuant to which Dropsuite would be acquired
NinjaOne, and subsequent significant disposals of Dropsuite shares by Topline
which it failed to disclose in a timely manner.
The Panel considered that, while
the statement was ambiguous as to whether Topline implied it would not dispose
of Dropsuite shares
prior to the scheme meeting, timely disclosure of the
disposals would have clarified the position. After the application was made,
Topline disclosed further disposals. The Panel considered these were contrary to
the intention stated in a second statement made
by Topline and that it again
failed to disclose in a timely manner. The Panel made orders requiring Topline
to maintain and vote
its remaining Dropsuite shares in favour of the scheme,
subject to certain qualifications.

Topline Capital Management, LLC
is an ASX listed company (ASX code: DSE) which provides cloud backup, archiving
and recovery services.
28 January 2025, Dropsuite announced that it had entered into a scheme
implementation deed with NinjaOne under which
had agreed to acquire 100%
of Dropsuite’s ordinary shares for $5.90 per share in cash via a scheme of
arrangement (
Proposed Scheme
its announcement, Dropsuite made the following statements (
First Intention
) regarding its largest shareholder, Topline, which had been
approved by Topline on 23 January 2025:
(a) “Dropsuite’s largest shareholder, Topline Capital Management,
LLC, which holds or controls approximately 31.0% of
the Company’s issued
as at the date of this announcement, has confirmed to
Dropsuite that it intends to vote, or cause to be voted, all Dropsuite shares
held or controlled by it in favour of the Scheme, subject to the same
qualifications.
As at the date of this
announcement, Topline Capital Management, LLC holds or controls approximately
21.6m Dropsuite shares, representing
approximately 31.0% of the Dropsuite shares
on issue on an undiluted basis”
(b) “Dropsuite’s largest shareholder, Topline Capital Management,
LLC, which as at the date of this announcement, holds
or controls approximately
21.6 million Dropsuite shares or 31.0% of the Company’s issued
capital on an undiluted basis, has
confirmed to Dropsuite that it intends to
vote, or cause to be voted, all Dropsuite shares held or controlled by it in
the Scheme in the absence of a Superior Proposal and subject to an
Independent Expert concluding (and continuing to conclude) that
the Scheme is in
the best interest of Dropsuite shareholders”
28 January 2025 and 6 February 2025 (inclusive), Topline disposed of Dropsuite
shares on-market, decreasing its voting power
from 21,639,316 shares (31.0%) to
13,829,409 shares (19.7%) (
First On-Market Sales
). During this period,
Topline’s undisclosed position changed by at least 1% on 28 January, 29
January, 31 January and 4 February
2025. However, it only disclosed its change
in voting power in one substantial holder notice on 18 February
February 2025 substantial holder notice stated
“Topline Capital
continues to firmly support Dropsuite being acquired by NinjaOne. The share
sales were made because of an unforseen
(sic) need for liquidity and because the
position became a large percent of the portfolio. Topline Capital intends to
hold its remaining
shares through the close of the transaction and vote in favor
of the transaction”
Second Intention Statement
11 March, 12 March and 14 March 2025, 3 institutions respectively lodged notices
of initial substantial holder in relation to their
substantial shareholdings in
2 April 2025, Dropsuite released the scheme booklet for the Proposed Scheme

Dropsuite shareholders to
consider and vote on the scheme (

) would be held on 9 May
APPLICATION
application dated 17 March 2025, the Applicant sought a declaration of
unacceptable circumstances. It submitted (among other things)
(a) The First Intention Statement did not indicate that Topline had reserved the
right to sell Dropsuite shares before voting in
favour of the Proposed Scheme.
Therefore, a reasonable investor would have concluded that Topline intended to
maintain its 31% interest
and vote that interest in favour of the Proposed
(b) The First On‑Market Sales indicate that the First Intention Statement
may have been given
“on a knowingly misleading
(c) Even if the First On‑Market Sales were contemplated in the First
Intention Statement, Topline failed to disclose those
transactions within the
time required by
section 671B
creating a false market in Dropsuite shares to Topline’s benefit.
Applicant submitted that the effect of the circumstances was that
“without knowledge in [the] market that Topline had no intention to
maintain its 31.0% interest and that it was a material seller,
achieved a higher sale price and sold more shares than might otherwise have been
the case. Anyone transacting in Dropsuite
shares between 28 January and 18
February were transacting on an uninformed basis to the benefit of
Interim orders sought
Applicant sought interim orders that Topline
“be prevented from any
further selling of shares”
Final orders sought
Applicant sought final orders that Topline
“is required to return to
and vote a 31.0% interest in favour of the scheme of arrangement at the relevant
scheme meeting, in
line with paragraph 12a and 12d of Takeovers Panel Guidance
Note 23, such that it remains compliant with the [First Intention
Statement]”
have considered all the material presented to us in coming to our decision, but
only specifically address those matters that we
consider necessary to explain
our reasoning.
Second On-Market Sales
18 March 2025 (the day after the application was submitted), Topline lodged
another substantial holder notice disclosing that its
voting power in Dropsuite
had further decreased from 13,829,409 shares (19.7%) to 7,363,034 shares (10.5%)
following various on‑market
sales of Dropsuite shares between 27 February
2025 and 17 March 2025 (inclusive) (
Second On‑Market Sales
this period, Topline’s undisclosed position changed by at least 1% on 28
February, 11 March, 12 March and 14 March
2025. However, it only disclosed its
change in voting power in the one substantial holder notice on 18 March
Interim orders
Acting President of the Panel considered the interim orders sought by the
Applicant on an urgent basis and the parties were invited
submissions.
submitted that:
(a) It was prepared to give an undertaking that it would ensure that Topline
Capital Partners LP (the registered holder of Topline’s
Dropsuite shares)
did not dispose of its remaining 7,363,034 Dropsuite shares until the earliest
of: (1) the determination of the
proceedings or (2) the date which was two
business days after Topline Capital Partners LP served a notice terminating the
undertaking
on the Panel and the Applicant, or the Panel otherwise made further
orders in respect of Topline’s shares.
(b) Accordingly, no interim orders were required.
Applicant submitted that the interim orders sought in its application should be
made because:
(a) The Second On-Market Sales, which Topline had again failed to disclose
within the time required by
section 671B
, were contrary to the intention stated
in the Second Intention Statement.
(b) Having regard to this (which only became apparent the day after the
application was submitted) and the matters raised in the
application concerning
the First Intention Statement and First On-Market Sales, Topline had:
(i) shown no intention to comply with its intention statements or its disclosure
obligations
(ii) shown an intention to
“wilfully act in an opposite manner to its
public representations, indicating that statements have been made to market on a
deliberately misleading basis”
(iii) acted in a manner that conflicts with the operation of
section 602.
Acting President made interim orders (see Annexure A) which provided that
without the prior consent of the Acting President or
the Panel (once appointed),
Topline, Topline Capital Partners LP and their associates must not: (1) sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose
of any shares or interests in shares in Dropsuite
or (2) decrease their voting power in Dropsuite.
making these interim orders, the Acting President considered it relevant that
the undertaking offered by Topline could be terminated
by Topline upon giving
two days’ notice. In the Acting President’s view, this introduced a
risk that could undermine
the preservation of the status quo.
Decision to conduct proceedings
21 March 2025, Topline made preliminary submissions in response to the
application, submitting that we should decline to conduct
proceedings because,
among other things:
(a) Topline’s contraventions of
section 671B
were in each case an honest, inadvertent and administrative oversight caused by
a combination of limited resources, extraordinarily
volatile market conditions
which materially affected its business, and the personal circumstances of its
sole manager.
(b) The form of the First Intention Statement is very common in the Australian
market and cannot be reasonably understood to restrict
Topline from disposing of
any Dropsuite shares.
(c) The Second Intention
Statement did clearly suggest that Topline would not dispose of shares in
Dropsuite. However, it was
“unlikely to have been actually relied upon
by persons considering whether or not to trade in Dropsuite shares. The
was contained in fine print as a footnote at the very back of the
substantial holding notice”
(d) Topline genuinely had no intention, at the time
it approved the First Intention Statement or made the Second Intention
to dispose of any Dropsuite shares. Further, it did not understand
the potential for such statements to be binding under ASIC’s
in takeovers’ policy as opposed to non-binding statements of current
intention only.
(e) There were no unacceptable circumstances because
there had been no impact on an efficient, competitive and informed market or
other relevant adverse impact. In support of this, Topline submitted that:
(i) market participants who bought shares from Topline were very unlikely to
vote against the Proposed Scheme because it would be
economically irrational to
(ii) since Topline provided disclosure pursuant to
section 671B
, there had not
been any material movement in trading price in Dropsuite shares. In
particular:
(A) Dropsuite’s
closing price on the date it announced the Proposed Scheme (28 January 2025) was
(B) Dropsuite’s
closing price on the dates Topline disclosed the First On-Market Sales (on 18
February 2025) and Second On-Market
Sales (on 18 March 2025) was $5.75 and $5.76
respectively
(C) Dropsuite’s
average closing price throughout the period from 28 January to 20 March
2025 (inclusive) was $5.76 and
(D) the average
price at which Topline sold shares pursuant to the On-Market Sales was
(f) While the Applicant suggested that market participants would have assigned a
higher probability of a successful vote in favour
of the Proposed Scheme,
leading to a willingness to pay higher prices due to a lower perceived risk
profile, the actual trading data
set out above was inconsistent with this
(g) There were no final orders which would be appropriate to remedy the
circumstances, and the specific final orders sought by the
Applicant would be
unfairly prejudicial to Topline.
(h) The Applicant should have been aware of the
relevant circumstances from 18 February 2025 following the lodgement of
substantial holder notice on that date, however the application
was not made until one month later. Therefore, the application was
unreasonably
delayed which in part contributed to the circumstances.
our view, the matters raised in the application and Topline’s subsequent
disclosure of the Second On-Market Sales raised
concerns that warranted further
enquiry, including in relation to the application of ASIC’s ‘truth
in takeovers’
policy to the Intention Statements and Topline’s
contraventions of
section 671B
in connection with the On-Market Sales.
Accordingly, we decided to conduct proceedings.
was unclear based on the application how the Applicant’s interests were
affected by the relevant circumstances. To confirm
whether the Applicant had
standing under
section 657C(2)(d)
to make an application, we asked it to confirm
the nature and extent of its interest in Dropsuite (and when it acquired its
Applicant confirmed that it had a relevant interest in 1,986,276 Dropsuite
shares, representing voting power of approximately
2.85%. It acquired most of
these shares on-market on 28 January 2025 – the date on which the Proposed
Scheme was announced
and the First Intention Statement was made. The Applicant
submitted that it was an asset management company operating a merger arbitrage
investment strategy focused on corporate activity events, and that it acquired
its Dropsuite shares at a discount to the Proposed
Scheme consideration with a
view to profiting from the successful implementation of the transaction.
on the Applicant’s response, we were satisfied that its interests were
affected by the relevant circumstances and it therefore
had standing under
section 657C(2)(d)
to make an application.
Truth in takeovers
‘truth in takeovers’ policy is contained in RG 25. Under the policy,
substantial holders risk regulatory
action by ASIC, or an application by ASIC or
another party for a declaration of unacceptable circumstances, where they depart
a public statement regarding their intentions in relation to a
Panel has endorsed ‘truth in takeovers’ principles and RG 25 in
several decisions,
subject to the
duty of the Panel to exercise its powers in accordance with the
Corporations
(Cth), including by complying with
section 657A
in making a
declaration and
section 657D
general application of the policy to the Panel’s jurisdiction was
described in
BreakFree Limited 03 & BreakFree Limited
as follows (footnotes
“110. We consider that, in general, ASIC’s
truth in takeovers policy is an important and appropriate policy to apply in
context of takeovers in Australia.
111. Requiring persons to act in accordance with statements that they have
made to the market concerning their intentions in the context
of a takeover bid
under Chapter 6 promotes the principle set out in
section 602(a)
one of the purposes of Chapter 6 is to ensure that:
the acquisition of control over... the voting shares in a listed
company... takes place in an efficient, competitive and informed
112. Clearly, the market will be better informed if it is able to rely on
people acting, or being required to act, in accordance with
their public
statements of their own intentions. Of course, as is noted in [RG 25], it is
possible for a person to make a public
statement but still retain flexibility in
relation to the subject matter of the statement if the statement is
appropriately qualified”
Panel has also considered that the ‘truth in takeovers’ policy
applies to both takeover bids and schemes of arrangement.
the Panel stated as
follows (at [39], footnotes omitted):
‘truth in takeovers’ policy] does not expressly apply to schemes of
arrangement. This may be because
of the significant differences between
takeovers and that form of control transaction. Nevertheless, ASIC keeps a
watchful eye on
statements made in the context of schemes. [A party] submitted
‘we ask how this policy cannot apply to schemes?’ We agree
generally, the policy should apply in a scheme context. But its application may
be different to its application in a takeover
agree with the Panel in
Ludowici Limited
and believe that ASIC’s
‘truth in takeovers’ policy applies in the circumstances of this
First Intention Statement and First On-Market Sales
asked the parties whether the First Intention Statement should have indicated
that Topline had reserved the right to sell Dropsuite
shares before voting in
favour of the Proposed Scheme (and whether the fact it did not do so indicated
to the market that Topline
intended to maintain its 31% interest and vote that
interest in favour of the Proposed Scheme).
Applicant and NinjaOne submitted (among other things) that the First Intention
Statement should have included such a qualification,
and that the omission
conveyed to the market that Topline intended to retain its 31% interest and vote
that interest in favour of
the Proposed Scheme.
submitted (among other things) that:
(a) It was open for the market to have read the First Intention Statement in
several ways. Therefore, to prevent an inference that
Topline may have committed
to maintain its voting power, the First Intention Statement should have been
clearer about the possibility
that Topline’s voting power might change by
the time of the Scheme Meeting. An express statement that Topline had reserved
its right to sell Dropsuite shares before the Scheme Meeting would have implied
that possibility.
(b) As contemplated by Guidance Note 23: Shareholder
Intention Statements,
Intention Statement may have been misleading because it was expressed in terms
that are unclear in meaning or
(c) Where similar shareholder intention statements are provided at the
announcement of a scheme, the shareholder will generally not
dispose its shares,
and shareholders may have interpreted the First Intention Statement in the
context of that market practice.
(d) The First Intention Statement indicates Topline’s support for the
Proposed Scheme, but the act of disposing its shares
undermines this.
(e) Market participants might also have placed weight on Topline’s
significant 31% voting power to conclude disposal was neither
intended nor
likely. Firstly, a 31% shareholding is a potentially decisive amount to the
success of a scheme. Secondly, any disposal
between announcement and the Scheme
Meeting would generally occur at below the consideration offered, which appears
economically
irrational in the absence of disclosure about the possibility,
intent or need for disposal.
submitted (among other things) that:
(a) In considering how the market would have interpreted the First Intention
Statement, one must consider the statement without regard
to the subsequent
actions by Topline and in light of the market practice in the formulation, and
interpretation, of such statements.
(b) The First Intention Statement did not need to state expressly that Topline
had reserved the right to sell shares in order to
be free to take such action,
and did not indicate to the market that Topline would not sell any shares.
(c) The wording of the First Intention Statement is similar to that used in many
recent voting intention statements and is not understood
to restrict the maker
of the statement from disposing of target shares. Accordingly,
the Panel now decides that, as a matter of policy, a person who gives a voting
intention statement is prevented from selling
(or otherwise dealing in) any of
their shares unless they expressly reserve the right to sell (or to otherwise
deal in) their shares,
this would be a material new development... If this
position is adopted, it is reasonable to expect that voting intention statements
will start to be accompanied by long lists of qualifications as the persons
giving such statements will feel the need to seek to
field’ in terms of all the actions that they could take in the future (eg
selling shares, buying shares, stock
lending, granting of security interests,
transfer of shares to related bodies corporate etc)”
submitted (among other things) that:
(a) It genuinely had no intention at the time it approved the First Intention
Statement to dispose of any Dropsuite shares, and the
disposals resulted from
subsequent investor withdrawals in the last week of January 2025 and margin
calls in early February 2025
(b) Regardless of Topline’s intention, the First Intention Statement
cannot reasonably be understood to restrict Topline from
disposing of Dropsuite
shares (and it was not understood by Topline to have this effect).
(c) The form of statement represented by the First Intention Statement is very
common in the Australian market and it has never been
understood to act as a
standstill restricting the disposal or acquisition of shares in the target
during the period from making the
statement to the scheme meeting.
is apparent from the parties’ divergent interpretations, it was open for
the market to have read the First Intention Statement
in several ways. In our
view, the First Intention Statement was ambiguous as to whether Topline had
implied it would not dispose
of any Dropsuite shares prior to the Scheme
and of itself, this is not unacceptable and, in most cases, statements in the
form of the First Intention Statement are unlikely
to give rise to concerns from
a Panel perspective. This is particularly so where the shareholder does not
dispose of any of its shares,
or if it does, the resulting decrease in voting
power is small and disclosed within the time required by
section 671B.
ambiguity in the First Intention Statement would have been clarified on
30 January 2025 if Topline had lodged a substantial holder
notice by that
date as it was required to do. However, this did not occur and in contravention
of the substantial holder provisions,
Topline instead waited until 18 February
2025 to disclose the First On-Market Sales. For the following reasons we think
unacceptable.
decrease in Topline’s voting power was significant. We agree with the
Applicant that
“[a] declaration to vote 19.7% in favour of a scheme of
arrangement is materially different from a declaration to vote 31% in
(with increased materiality when taken in context of shareholder turnout rates
of less than 100%)”
acknowledge that it is not common market practice for shareholder intention
statements to expressly reserve the right to sell shares
and such reservations
weaken the strength of the commitment. While we do not consider that statements
in the form of the First Intention
Statement are prima facie
misleading,
we agree with ASIC
(a) where such shareholder intention statements are provided at the announcement
of a scheme, the shareholder will generally not
dispose its
and shareholders may have
interpreted the First Intention Statement in the context of that market practice
(b) market participants might also have placed weight on Topline’s 31%
voting power to conclude disposal was neither intended
nor likely.
Accordingly,
to prevent an inference that Topline may have committed to maintain its voting
power, the First Intention Statement could
have been clearer about the
possibility that Topline’s voting power might change before the Scheme
Meeting. This is particularly
so given the significance of Topline’s
holding and because as a leveraged fund, it is (and was) especially exposed to
volatility and the risk of margin calls and withdrawal requests forcing
it to sell shares (as submitted by Topline). Furthermore,
Topline began selling
shares the same day the Proposed Scheme and the First Intention Statement were
announced (i.e. 28 January 2025).
While we acknowledge that Topline consented to
the inclusion of the First Intention Statement on 23 January 2025 (i.e. five
earlier) we consider the proximity of Topline selling shares to the date of
the First Intention Statement indicates that Topline
was likely aware its voting
power might change before the Scheme Meeting.
also note that Topline was expressly advised by Dropsuite – when seeking
approval for the First Intention Statement –
that the First Intention
Statement was
“...akin to a formal confirmation from your part, so you
should consider getting a specialized lawyer to give you counsel”
did not do so. In our view, Dropsuite’s suggestion was appropriate, and it
would have been better practice for Topline
to obtain legal advice before
approving the First Intention
consider that the significant decrease in Topline’s voting power and the
ambiguity of the First Intention Statement (especially
given the context in
which it was made and the higher-than-usual likelihood that Topline would
dispose of shares) exacerbate the
severity of Topline’s contraventions of
the substantial holder provisions. These circumstances created a real risk that
market would not be properly informed about the Proposed Scheme’s
prospects of obtaining shareholder approval, given the appearance
from a 31% shareholder. In that context, timely disclosure of the First
On-Market Sales, as required under
section 671B
, was particularly important.
Topline’s failure to do so deprived the market of material information
during a live control proposal
for Dropsuite and, in our view, rendered the
contraventions especially
concerning.
Second Intention Statement and Second On-Market
Second On-Market Sales were only disclosed by Topline the day after the
application was submitted. Therefore, the application
did not allege any
non-compliance with the Second Intention Statement or contraventions of the
substantial holder provisions in connection
with the Second On-Market Sales by
Nonetheless,
our preliminary view was that these matters are logically connected to the
application and should be
considered.
We shared this
preliminary view with the parties, none of whom disagreed, and accordingly we
consider that the Second Intention Statement
and Second On-Market Sales are
logically connected to the application.
the First Intention Statement, the Second Intention Statement clearly stated
“Topline Capital intends to hold its remaining shares through the
close of the transaction and vote in favor of the transaction”
Accordingly, we consider that the Second On-Market Sales were clearly contrary
to the intention stated in the Second Intention
mentioned, Topline was also required under
section 671B
to lodge substantial
holder notices in relation to the Second On-Market Sales on 4 separate
occasions, being by 4 March, 13 March,
14 March and 18 March 2025 respectively,
but only disclosed its change in voting power in one notice on 18 March
Effect of the circumstances
asked the parties whether the circumstances had any impact on an efficient,
competitive and informed market in Dropsuite shares
or any other relevant
adverse effect, and whether the rights or interests of any person, or group of
persons, have been or are being
affected, or will be or are likely to be
affected, by the circumstances.
Applicant submitted (among other things) that
“[a]nyone transacting in
Dropsuite shares since the First Intention Statement has been affected... If
Dropsuite fails to secure
shareholder support for the Proposed Scheme,
particularly as a direct result of Topline’s disposal transactions, the
price is likely to fall to levels prior to the Proposed Scheme, inflicting
submitted (among other things) that
“[t]here remains a risk to NinjaOne
and its investors that their rights or interests may have been affected by
Topline having
sold 20.5% of the issued share capital, if such shares are
acquired by a rival bidder or otherwise voted against the [Proposed]
submitted (among other things) that the circumstances surrounding Topline had a
limited impact on the price or trading volume
of Dropsuite shares, providing an
analysis of Dropsuite’s trading volume and pricing over the relevant
period in support.
largely cross-referred to its preliminary submissions set out in paragraphs
submitted that it generally agreed that Topline’s substantial holder
notices lodged on 18 February 2025 and 18 March 2025
did not materially move the
market for Dropsuite shares. However, it also submitted (among other things)
that the overall circumstances
undermined the principles of an efficient,
competitive and informed market because the market was not properly informed
intentions and disposals, and shareholders may have
acquired or chosen not to sell shares on the basis the Proposed Scheme appeared
to have the support of a 31% shareholder, making it more likely although not
inevitable that the Proposed Scheme would be approved.
agree with ASIC that the absence of material movement in Dropsuite’s share
price – or a clearly quantifiable benefit
and detriment – does not
necessarily mean the circumstances had no impact on an efficient, competitive
and informed market.
The market was uninformed about Topline’s intentions
or its disposals for extended periods during a live control proposal.
principal objective of the substantial holder provisions is to disclose to the
market the whereabouts of shares which might affect
The substantial holder
provisions support the overall policy of Chapter 6, as set out in
section 602
which includes the objectives that: (a) control over shares in companies is
acquired in an efficient, competitive and informed
and (b) directors and
shareholders in a company know the identity of a person who proposes to acquire
a substantial interest in the
In this case, the
repeated and substantial delays in disclosing the On-Market Sales during a live
control proposal undermined those
principles.
Furthermore,
as a result of the circumstances, the First Intention Statement now only relates
to 10.5% of Dropsuite shares (compared
to 31%), impacting the certainty of the
Proposed Scheme being approved at the Scheme Meeting. In this regard, we agree
with NinjaOne
that there remains a risk from a deal certainty perspective to
NinjaOne if the shares sold by Topline are acquired by a rival bidder
otherwise voted against the Proposed
mentioned, Topline also submitted that the Second Intention Statement
“was unlikely to have been actually relied upon by persons considering
whether or not to trade in Dropsuite shares. The statement
was contained in fine
print as a footnote at the very back of the substantial holding notice at the
end of the annexure containing
details of the trades and consideration. It is
unlikely to have been identified by market participants and was not reported on
any public commentary or announcements by Dropsuite”
we agree that the Second Intention Statement was not prominently disclosed, we
do not consider this materially reduced the effect
of the circumstances as
described above. We consider that market participants were likely to have paid
more attention to the details
in Topline’s substantial holder notice,
given Topline disclosed a significant disposal of Dropsuite shares after the
Intention Statement was made.
Alleged inadvertence of conduct
asked the parties what significance (if any) we should attribute to
Topline’s submissions that it acted inadvertently or
without awareness of
the consequences of its conduct (see paragraphs
submitted (among other things) that:
(a) In considering whether there have been unacceptable circumstances, the
Panel’s focus is
“the effect of the circumstances on persons and

(a) The Panel has generally attributed limited significance to submissions that
a substantial shareholder has acted inadvertently
or without awareness when

least 30 substantial holder notices since that time.
It is the responsibility of
substantial shareholders to make themselves aware of their obligations under the

without awareness or inadvertently should be given
limited weight in the
circumstances. In reaching this conclusion, we consider the following to be

an efficient, competitive and informed market
were undermined (see paragraph
). While Topline’s submissions
offer explanations for its conduct, those explanations do not excuse these
(b) Topline’s submissions that it acted
inadvertently or without awareness of the consequences of its conduct are
to accept in relation to both its non-compliance with the Second
Intention Statement and its contraventions of the substantial holder
concerning the Second On-Market Sales. As mentioned, Topline was expressly
advised by Dropsuite – when seeking approval
for the First Intention
Statement – that the First Intention Statement was
“...akin to a
formal confirmation from your part, so you should consider getting a specialized
lawyer to give you counsel”
. It was also notified by Dropsuite of its
failure to comply with the substantial holder provisions in connection with the
First On-Market
Sales, after which it lodged its substantial holder notice on 18
February 2025. Despite this, Topline proceeded to act inconsistently

on limited knowledge or inadvertence – rather,
it is a sophisticated fund

with a current market
capitalisation of approximately $400 million.
(d) Topline has lodged at least 19 substantial holder notices in respect of
Dropsuite shares since it became a substantial holder
in 2020, and the majority
appear to have been lodged within the time required by
section 671B
, indicating
familiarity with the substantial holder provisions. Furthermore, ASIC’s
submission that Topline has invested in
Chapter 6 entities since at least 2020
and lodged at least 30 substantial holder notices since that time was not
rebutted by Topline.

context of the likely timing of the Proposed Scheme.
The timing of the
Applicant’s actions appears to have been guided by a reasonable and
considered assessment of the relevant
facts and circumstances before submitting
the application. We also had regard to the Applicant’s rebuttal that it
“spent an appropriate amount of time and resources confirming the
merits and specifics of its application to ensure it was not
frivolous or
vexatious. The onus is not on [the Applicant], a small asset management firm, to
ensure all market participants comply
with the relevant takeover laws, and nor
is it reasonable to expect that [the Applicant] dedicate resources in the
ordinary course
of business to identify external contrary conduct in a timeframe
convenient to the offending market participant”

(a) Topline contravened the substantial holder provisions on the occasions
referred to in paragraphs

(c) The First Intention Statement would have been clarified on 30 January 2025
if Topline had lodged a substantial holder notice
by that date, as it was
required to do.

their voting power in Dropsuite and (3) vote, or cause to be

(a) Requiring Topline to re-purchase Dropsuite shares on-market could have
unintended consequences for the trading price of Dropsuite
shares. For example,
the presence of a known buyer may artificially inflate the price.
(b) We acknowledge that market participants who acquired Dropsuite shares on the
basis that the Proposed Scheme had the support of
a 31% shareholder now face an
increased risk profile, as the certainty of the Proposed Scheme being approved
has been impacted. However,
if this is a concern for those participants, they
remain free to sell their shares on-market. In this regard, we note that
substantial holder notices lodged on 18 February 2025 and 18
March 2025 did not materially move the market for Dropsuite shares.
(c) Topline submitted that given the liquidity position of its fund, it would
not be possible to comply with the orders sought by
the Applicant without
unfairly and materially prejudicing its third-party investors. We agree and are
satisfied that such an order
would be unfairly prejudicial to Topline (noting
also our concern in paragraph (a) above).

consequence for a breach of the ‘truth in takeovers’

submitted (among other things) that Topline should be held to its unqualified
voting intention statement (i.e. the Second
Intention Statement). Accordingly,
the order requiring Topline to vote in favour of the Proposed Scheme should be
unqualified, rather
than subject to the qualifications contained in the First
Intention Statement – namely, that Topline will vote its Dropsuite
in favour of the Proposed Scheme in the absence of a superior proposal and
subject to an independent expert concluding (and
continuing to conclude) that
the Proposed Scheme is in the best interest of Dropsuite shareholders.
contrast, Dropsuite submitted that the order should be subject to the same
qualifications contained in the First Intention Statement,
stating that it would

voting power in Dropsuite has decreased to 10.5%,
it remains a significant
interest and could be perceived as a ‘blocking stake’ by a potential
competing bidder.

submissions during these proceedings. This facilitated
the prompt determination
