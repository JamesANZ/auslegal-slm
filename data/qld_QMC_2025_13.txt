CASES CONSIDERED:
MDE v MLG & Queensland Police Service
[2015] QDC 151
SOLICITORS:
QPS for both applicants.
K. Green – AFLS for the female aggrieved
The male aggrieved was unrepresented
[1] MIH pleaded guilty before me to a number of drug offences and to breaching
his domestic violence order made in favour of REH.
REH has also breached
domestic violence orders where he is the aggrieved and she been convicted of
drug offences.
[2] They have a child who remains in the care of REH and in
front of whom both have perpetrated domestic violence.
[3] Constable Jackson
as applicant thinks that REH is the most in need of protection as MIH provokes
her with acts of domestic violence.
[4] Senior Constable Scheu thinks that
MIH is the party most in need of protection because REH when provoked uses
weapons to threaten
or harm MIH.
[5] The prosecutor who appeared made
submissions favouring an order protecting MIH because he is attacked with
weapons. AFLS made
submissions favouring their client REH because she is only
reacting to his DV towards her.
[6] I have decided that REH is the most in
need of protection and these are my reasons for that decision.
Winner Takes
[7] As a result of the Domestic and Family Violence Protection (Combating
Coercive Control) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2023
(the CC Act), final
orders can no longer be made against both parties in a relationship except in
limited circumstances.
[8] I note that neither of the applicants here is a
‘systems abuser’ seeking to perpetrate domestic violence by
unwarranted
cross-applications. They are both police officers who each take a
different but understandable approach to the situation they have
been confronted
[9] Section 41G nonetheless governs these cross-applications and will
render one partner and the child with no protection from the
domestic violence
of the other partner.
[10] The CC Act is
based on the notion that mutual domestic violence only occurs in the context of
a clear perpetrator/victim dichotomy.
I have previously observed some of the
difficulties in applying that strict dichotomy to the range of relationships the
Court encounters.
[11] Once again, there is very little information about the
‘context of the relationship as a whole’ and again there was
cross-examination. This is again because the parties affected by the order do
not participate in the process to the extent of
cross-examine.
[12] There is however in this case little dispute as to the
facts. He goes to her house and says things and does acts of DV that cause
She reacts with violence and
weapons. He gets chased away if not actually harmed.
[13] Both have breached
various forms of orders. Both have exposed their children to
[14] Her offending is more persistent, serious, and recent. She
uses weapons on him and he has shown the scars to police who have
photographed
his injuries. These are not necessarily thought to be fresh.
[15] Both have
the same factors listed in s22A(2)(e) except of course that she is a woman. She
also has the primary care of a young
child, is physically slight and is
indigenous.
[16] As they have a child together, the parties have relevant
relationship. They have each admitted to police that they have done
a number of
acts towards the other which amount to domestic violence. These are analysed in
more detail below. For now, it is sufficient
to note that, if there was only one
application, or s.41G did not exist, I would not hesitate to conclude that the
requirements for
the making of an order protecting both (and the child to
exposure to DV from both) are clearly met.
[17] REH is perhaps not the most eloquent of speakers in
the footage tendered. Her affidavit is as well written as a university essay.
is replete with submissions and opinion which diminish the focus on its only
real purpose: to convey facts about which a conclusion
can be drawn. Parties are
best served by complying with the directions in Annexure A of PD 4 of 2022 and
submitting affidavits which
address the evidence only.
[18] REH does convey
that MIH has falsely accused her of selling videos of herself online repeatedly,
pushed her down, punched, kicked
and even hit her with a wooden plank. He has
taken her phone and locked her outside. She believes his ice usage makes him
in this way. She might well know this as she is also a user of that drug.
He has threatened to report he to Child Safety and have
the baby taken from
[19] She accepts that his behaviour towards him has made her physically
lash out at him.
[20] She says she does not know how to get away other than
having an order in her favour. She still wants this person she describes
monster to be able to come to her house but not to stay.
[21] Her police
notebook statement accepts that ‘We’re both using drugs
[22] Officer Jackson confirms that the 21 May 2024
response involved him sighting the door ripped off which REH said MIH did.
[23] I note Jackson’s ‘evidence’ at [29] which again is
more of a submission:
I believe both parties perpetrate domestic violence
against each other, and both MIH and REH should be protected by way of a [sic]
cross domestic violence orders. As per section 41G(3) of the [DFVPA] it my
understanding that there is clear evidence each party
in the relationship
require [sic] protection from the other party. I do not think it is possible to
decide whether MIH required more
protection from REH then [sic] vice versa.
However, in my opinion REH requires more protection from MIH due to the size
age, and social status. REH is only 25 years old and currently not
working. She is receiving minimal support by way of Government
benefits. She is
the full-time carer of [their child], and it appears she receives little to no
assistance in raising or careering
[sic] for [the child] which is affecting her
financially. I am aware both MIH and REH are drug users as stated by REH
herself. It
is likely this drug behaviour and their financial worries are
affecting their relationship causing hostilities between each other
escalating the number of domestic violence incidents. If an order isn’t
created, it is my belief domestic violence between
the two will increase and
escalate. Police have the Courts have an obligation to protection REH, MIH and
[their child] from further
domestic violence.
[24] Firstly, Parliament has a
different view about parties perpetrating domestic violence against each other
(and their children).
S41G makes it clear that based on the perpetrator/victim
response model, there should be only one order.
[25] Clear evidence that
they both need or even want protection from the other does not mean this Court
is permitted to protect both.
It is only permitted to protect the ‘most in
need of protection’. What ought to be exceptional is that the Court cannot
determine who this is. A matter is not exceptional, and an order therefore
should be made protecting both simply because it is clear
that both need
protection.
[26] While SC Jackson might opine that it is not possible to tell
who that is, he goes on to name some factors in REH’s favour.
sometime hard to know how some of these such as the existence of a
characteristic making them more vulnerable to domestic
violence are relevant to
the perpetrator/victim model, especially if both have them.
has filed no affidavit in response and did not seek to cross-examine her. He
said in closing submissions both that he loved
her and that when he came out of
prison he would have some ‘complaints’ to
[28] Constable Scheu attended an event on 3 Jul 2024 as which
her information read “[Informant] states that there is domestic
next door. Inf states that the Female has thrown a child at a male to get the
male to carry the child. She has then ripped
the child out of the male and then
chased the male down the street.”
[29] On attendance she observed a
very upset REH abusing MIH on the phone who said it was all about her getting
upset at him not getting
milk. Their child was being affected by her response
to the DV that had taken place.
[30] Scheu relied on several other incident
reports in her application. These were given references during
submissions.
[31] Item E in paragraph 24 was on 21 June 2024. Scheu did not
attend herself. REH has seen something on MIH’s phone that he
did not want
to discuss, and she asked him to leave her house. She then attacked him with
scissors. He did not wish to make a complaint
and the marks he showed police
appeared old to them. REH did not admit to using scissors. I am unable to assess
from the related
QPRIME entries who called the police.
[32] I assess this
event as REH initiating the DV with monitoring of MIH’s phone. I do not
accept that he was injured that night
by her on the balance of
probabilities.
[33] Item F on 18 June 2024 records that the informant often
hears fighting and that the Male is agitating the Female and she has
had left by the time police arrived and said he had been calling her derogatory
names and she had chased him outside with
knives. An order had been made against
MIH on 29 May 2024 but was unserved some 3-4 weeks later when this even
happened. It is regrettably
common that DV orders are not served for weeks or
even months after being made and so have no effect.
[34] A supplementary
report notes that REH alleged MIH was berating her in text messages. Police
photographed the messages and noted
both parties appear to be equally abusive. I
assess he has commenced the DV and she has responded.
[35] Item G / paragraph
26 happened on 21 May 202 MIH came to REH’s house and accused her of
‘Doing things online for
money’. She threw a Weetabix packet at him.
They scuffled throwing punches at one another. He ended up locked out but ripped
off the screen door. He would not provide a statement to police and she denied
the incident.
[36] She also said she did not want the relationship to
continue. She said both were actively using drugs that she is scared of him
that he has been going through her phone.
[37] While QPS classified this as a
‘consensual fight’ it bears all the hallmarks of an attack on her
which persisted
after he was removed from the house.
[38] Item J paragraph 28
happened on 16 April 2024. There was an argument over passwords. She slapped him
with a remote control. There
was a scuffle. He took her phone and was going to
leave. He ended up locking her out (of her house). When he unlocked the door,
ran in and got a knife. The forgoing appears to be his version. Her version
given later at the police station counter was that he
[39] Item K
was on 21 March 2024. It was her complaint that he had hit her with a stick and
left. She told police that he had picked
her up from Brisbane and they argued in
the car and when they got home that she got a knife and tried to chase him out
of the house
after an argument and he got a machete and hit her with a
[40] Item M was on 16 July 2022 – Police stopped their car. She
admitted causing him the injuries they could see. He didn’t
want to make a
[41] It follows from these events that both see themselves as the
victim even where they started the incident; they both use weapons;
lie to or refuse to cooperate with police and they both breach orders made
against them.
[42] The pattern of highly disadvantaged couples suffering from
things such as organic or traumatic brain injuries, alcoholism, mental
issues, serious drug addiction or some combination of these is the everyday
lived experience in the DV Court in this region.
The systems abusing
cross-applicant who perpetrates DV and tries to present themselves as the victim
is rarely seen.
Most in need of protection
[43] My assessment of their
‘relationship as a whole’ is that she flies off the handle to
violence with weapons when he
enters her house and initiates verbal abuse
towards her. Her response is not necessarily proportionate, justifiable, or
Section 22A(b) does not require it to be any of these. But it is a
response to him calling her names or making other accusations.
It is clear that
she is scared of him, and he is not scared of her. This is not determinative,
nor has it led to her seeking an order.
[44] What distinguishes this case
from some others is that there is little dispute about the events and where
there is, there is little
doubt that the instigating party is readily discerned
to be true on the balance of probabilities. It is MIH. He is only the victim
when he goes to her house and confronts her with allegations (of which there are
no evidence).
[45] That she is the most in need of protection is something
that Parliament say should only not be able to be made except in exceptional
circumstances. While the state of the evidence is far from being as clear as it
might be, it is sufficient to make the determination.
[46] I will make the
orders in favour of REH in the mandatory term. That is all that is sought. While
she has in her affidavit expressed
fear of MIH, she has not made an application
for anything else in the months this matter has taken to reach
[47] That means I must dismiss the application to vary the order in
favour of MIH which seeks to add the child. The result of the
application of
s.41G(2)(c) is again a reduced level of protection for children. This does not
appear to be consistent with their
[48] I am of the view that Act
requires me to hear and determine applications under s.32. Those applications
are limited to being
made by certain people, required to be in writing and
served. I do not believe that a Magistrate has a power to add conditions not
sought in those applications. No such power is granted expressly or by necessary
implication from s.3 and 4.
[49] The only time a court may act on its own
initiative is under s.42. Given their past histories of breaching orders, both
seem quite possible they will expose themselves to this prospect in the
future and s.42 is unfettered by Division 1A (the cross-application
provisions).
For example, if REH is convicted of an offence which is a ‘domestic
violence offence’ under the Criminal
an order can be made against her even if
she is the most in need of protection. Such an order could also name the
[50] The structure of the DV Act implies that an order in the
mandatory term only will protect her and therefore that she will not
need to use
domestic violence herself in the future.
