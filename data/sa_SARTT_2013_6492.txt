D'Angelica & Greco (by Adelaide Hills Estates Pty Ltd) v Smania & Smania v D'Angelica & Greco (by Adelaide Hills Estates Pty Ltd) [2013] SARTT 6492 (27 November 2013)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 28 NOVEMBER
Hearing 27 November 2013 at Adelaide
SMANIA v D'ANGELICA & GRECO (by L J Hooker St
D'ANGELICA & GRECO (by L J Hooker St Peters) v
SMANIA (RT13/6492)
Order 1 (28 November 2013)
Application by tenant for repairs, removal
of landlords’ belongings and redirection of mail. Landlord sought order
possession on the basis of outstanding water invoices.
The RTT finds that the landlord is in breach of Section 65 of the Residential
Tenancies act (tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment),
and Section 68
(obligation to provide the property in reasonable condition and maintain it that
way). The RTT finds that the tenant
is in breach of her obligation to pay water.
The RTT directs the landlord to remove the belongings, redirect mail and pay
compensation
of $285.81.
Order 2 (12 March 2014)
The landlord applies for vacant possession on
the basis that the tenant is using the premises for a commercial purpose. The
that the tenant is using part of the premises for a commercial
purpose, but that the landlords are aware or should have been aware
of that, and
given the length of the tenancy (over 2 years), it would be inappropriate to
require the tenant to vacate.
This is the determination of two applications. The first is an application by
the tenant seeking orders for the landlords’ belongings
to be removed from
the property, side fence to be reinstated, the landlords to arrange for mail to
be redirected and repairs and
compensation.
The second is an application by the landlord seeking an order for vacant
possession on the basis of unpaid water invoices.
Both applications were dealt with at the hearing. Both applications concern a
residential tenancy agreement (the agreement). I note
that the tenant carries on
her hairdressing business from the premises. However, there is no separate
agreement about that and the
agreement relating to this property is clearly a
residential tenancy agreement. The agreement is subject to the
Residential
Tenancies Act 1995

The tenant:
Charlene Smania
The tenant’s application
belongings Under
Sections 67
of the Act, the landlords are required to
provide the property to the tenant in a reasonable condition and reasonably
clean. I am
satisfied that the landlords have left substantial items at the
property including a kiln and related materials. Those items are
interfering
with the tenant’s enjoyment of her property and in leaving them there the
landlords are in breach of their obligations
under the Act.
I will require the landlords to remove all of their items from the property
within 14 days.
The tenant produced photos to show that the landlords had
cut off the top part of a section of the fence. The tenant said that they
agreed to reinstate the fence. There is nothing in writing about any such
agreement. I find that I do not have sufficient evidence
of any such agreement
and therefore I will make no order in relation to the fence.
The tenant gave evidence that the landlords had not
redirected their mail and consequently all of their mail still went to her
She said that the landlords go through her mail every day to retrieve
their own mail. This is a breach of her right to quiet enjoyment
of the property
of the Act. I will require the landlords to redirect their mail
and to cease going through the tenants’ mail. If there are
any letters
belonging to the landlords, the tenant can give them to the landlords. I will
allow the tenant compensation of $250.00
for this breach of her right to quiet
enjoyment of the property.
Repairs and compensation
The tenant gave evidence that the ceiling
fan in the bathroom does not work, she reported it at the first quarterly
inspection. The
agent confirmed the problem with the ceiling fan in the bathroom
was reported early on in the tenancy and has been reported to the
landlords. As
a result mould has formed on the ceiling and walls in the bathroom. I find that
the landlords’ failure to fix
or replace the ceiling fan is in breach of
of the Act and I will require the landlords to carry out repairs and
arrange for the mould to be treated. Although the mould is unsightly
consider it to be so extreme that the tenant should be paid compensation.
The tenant gave evidence that the bracket around the oven had broken and she
first reported this on 17 April 2012. It was reported
on multiple occasions
after that (this was confirmed by the agent). She said that it was finally fixed
2 months ago and so she has
not had a functioning oven for more than 18
I find that the landlords are in breach of their obligations under
of the Act in relation to the oven. Although some people would consider a
non-functioning oven to be a significant problem, I note
that the tenant could
have come to the Tribunal earlier. Nevertheless, I consider she should be
compensated for this inconvenience
and I will allow $300.00 for it.
Ms Smania complained that the pot belly stove had not worked since the
commencement of the tenant and she had reported it to the agent.
I will require
the landlords to have a technician inspect the stove and carry out any necessary
Ms Smania also complained that the landlords attended at the property on one
occasion with no notice and removed a fireplace and bar
b que. She produced
photos of a fireplace which has been boarded up and she said that it is
unsightly in the living area of her house.
The landlords are not entitled to arrive unannounced at the tenant’s
property and should not have removed the bar b que and
fireplace without her
I find that the landlords’ actions are in breach of the tenant’s
right to quiet enjoyment of the property and have adversely
impacted on her
enjoyment of the property. I will allow compensation of $150.00 to the tenant
for this breach.
Ms Smania said that there are downlights which appear to have a faulty
fitting as the globes cease functioning regularly. Mr Buccella
said that this
problem was first reported on 14 May 2013 and was then reported again on 10
September 2013.
I will require the landlords to arrange for an appropriately qualified
electrician to inspect the downlights, carry out any necessary
repairs and
provide a certificate of compliance to the agent. The agent must then provide
the certificate of compliance to the tenant.
The landlords’ application
The landlords seek vacant
possession on the basis that the tenant has failed to pay outstanding water
invoices of $414.19. The landlords
also sought an order that the tenant pay the
cost of the Tribunal application fee. The landlords’ application is made
basis of a Form 2, notice of termination. I find that notice to be
The tenant disputed the claim and said that there has been a leak at the
property. She referred to previous water bills which are
significantly
The agent said that the landlords had arranged for SA Water and a plumber to
attend at the property and they had found there to be
no leaks. He referred to
an invoice dated 19 June 2013 from the plumber.
I am satisfied that that the landlords have properly investigated any
possible leak and there is no evidence of a leak.
The compensation I will require the landlords to pay to the tenant is
$700.00. However, the tenant must pay the outstanding invoices
of $414.19. I
will therefore make an order which requires the landlords to pay a “net
amount “ of compensation which
is $285.81.
landlords must pay compensation of $285.81 to the tenant. This is to be done by
crediting the rent record forthwith.
to making arrangements with the tenant to carry out the following actions at a
time which is convenient to the tenant, the
(a) arrange for a qualified tradesperson to repair or
replace the ceiling fan in the bathroom within 14 days of the date of this
(b) arrange for the mould on the ceiling and walls of the bathroom to be
properly treated within 21 days of the date of this order;
(c) remove all of their belongings from the property (including their
kiln and associated materials) within 14 days of the date of
this order;
(d) arrange for their mail to be redirected immediately and cease going
to the tenant’s letterbox immediately;
(e) arrange for an appropriately qualified electrician to attend at the
property to investigate and if necessary repair the faulty
downlights within 14
days of the date of this order. The electrician will provide a certificate of
compliance to the agent within
21 days of the date of this order.
the landlords fail to carry out any of the actions required by order 2, the
tenant may contact the Tribunal in writing and request
an urgent hearing.
