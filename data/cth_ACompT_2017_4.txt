THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
is worth repeating the basis of the Tribunal’s powers of review.
71C Grounds for review
(1) An application under section 71B(1) may be made only on 1 or more of the
following grounds:
(a) the AER made an error of fact in its
findings of facts, and that error of fact was material to the making of the
(b) the AER made more than 1 error of fact in its findings of facts, and that
those errors of fact, in combination, were material
to the making of the
(c) the exercise of the AER's discretion was incorrect, having regard to all the
circumstances;
(d) the AER's decision was unreasonable, having regard to all the
circumstances.
(1a) An application under section 71B(1) must also
specify the manner in which a determination made by the Tribunal varying the
regulatory decision, or setting aside the reviewable regulatory
decision and a fresh decision being made by the AER following remission
matter to the AER by the Tribunal, on the basis of 1 or more grounds raised in
the application, either separately or collectively,
would, or would be likely
to, result in a materially preferable NEO decision.
(2) It is for the applicant to establish a ground listed in subsection (1) and
the matter referred to in subsection (1a).
“national electricity objective” (
) was set out in s 7 and
stated as follows:
7 National electricity objective
The objective of this Law is to promote efficient investment in, and efficient
operation and use of, electricity services for the
long term interests of
consumers of electricity with respect to--
(a) price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of electricity;
(b) the reliability, safety and security of the national electricity
expression “materially preferable NEO decision” was defined in s 71A
with reference to s 71P(2a)(c) as follows:
71P Tribunal must make determination
(1) If, following an application, the Tribunal grants leave in accordance with
section 71B(1), the Tribunal must make a determination
in respect of the
application.
See section 71Q for the time limit within
which the Tribunal must make its
determination.
(2) Subject to subsection (2a), a determination under
this section may--
(a) affirm the reviewable regulatory
decision; or
(b) vary the reviewable regulatory decision; or
(c) set aside the reviewable regulatory decision and remit the matter back to
the AER to make the decision again in accordance with
any direction or
recommendation of the Tribunal.
(2a) Despite subsection (2), the Tribunal may only make
a determination--
(a) to vary the reviewable regulatory
decision under subsection (2)(b); or
(b) to set aside the reviewable regulatory decision and remit the matter back to
the AER under subsection (2)(c),
(c) the Tribunal is satisfied that to do so will, or is likely to, result in a
decision that is materially preferable to the reviewable
regulatory decision in
making a contribution to the achievement of the national electricity objective
“materially preferable NEO decision”
) (and if the Tribunal
is not so satisfied the Tribunal must affirm the decision); and
(d) in the case of a determination to vary the reviewable regulatory
decision--the Tribunal is satisfied that to do so will not require
the Tribunal
to undertake an assessment of such complexity that the preferable course of
action would be to set aside the reviewable
regulatory decision and remit the
matter to the AER to make the decision
(2b) In connection with the operation of subsection (2a)
(and without limiting any other matter that may be relevant under this Law)--
(a) the Tribunal must consider how the
constituent components of the reviewable regulatory decision interrelate with
each other and
with the matters raised as a ground for review; and
(b) without limiting paragraph (a), the Tribunal must take into account the
revenue and pricing principles (in the same manner in
which the AER is to take
into account these principles under section 16); and
(c) the Tribunal must, in assessing the extent of contribution to the
achievement of the national electricity objective, consider
the reviewable
regulatory decision as a whole; and
(d) the following matters must not, in themselves, determine the question about
whether a materially preferable NEO decision exists:
(i) the establishment of a
ground for review under section 71C(1);
(ii) consequences for, or impacts on, the average annual regulated revenue of a
regulated network service provider;
(iii) that the amount that is specified in or derived from the reviewable
regulatory decision exceeds the amount specified in section
(2c) If the Tribunal makes a determination under
subsection (2)(b) or (c), the Tribunal must specify in its determination--
(a) the manner in which it has taken into
account the interrelationship between the constituent components of the
reviewable regulatory
decision and how they relate to the matters raised as a
ground for review as contemplated by subsection (2b)(a); and
(b) in the case of a determination to vary the reviewable regulatory
decision--the reasons why it is proceeding to make the variation
in view of the
requirements of subsection (2a)(d).
(3) For the purposes of making a determination of the
kind in subsection (2)(a) or (b), the Tribunal may perform all the functions
exercise all the powers of the AER under this Law or the Rules.
(4) (Repealed)
(5) A determination by the Tribunal affirming, varying or setting aside the
reviewable regulatory decision is, for the purposes of
this Law (other than this
Part), to be taken to be a decision of the AER.
CORPORATE OVERHEADS EXPENSING
What the AER decided
its Distribution Determination for CitiPower, the AER included an adjustment for
corporate overheads in its opex forecast. This
reflected a change in
CitiPower’s capitalisation policy for those costs. Whereas previously
CitiPower partially capitalised
those costs, from 2016 it would fully expense
them, the AER said. This was the primary reason for the forecast increase in
opex between
2015 and 2016.
Attachment 7, at 7-45, the AER said it had maintained an adjustment to base opex
for corporate overheads. In its
preliminary
decision, the AER had
accepted an adjustment to base opex for this change in CitiPower’s
capitalisation policy in relation
to corporate overheads. Consistent with its
approved Cost Allocation Method (
), the AER accepted this adjustment.
This was the main reason the AER’s estimate of forecast opex increased
relative to CitiPower's
historical opex. However, the AER used a different
amount to the amount CitiPower proposed in the AER’s preliminary decision
opex forecast. CitiPower proposed that the adjustment be based on its 2014
capitalised overheads. For a number of reasons the AER
considered an average of
2012 to 2014 capitalised overheads was preferable to CitiPower’s approach.
In particular, the AER
Expenditure in a
single year was often affected by non-recurrent factors. If these costs were
higher than average in the most recent
audited year, forecast opex would be
higher than required to meet the opex objectives. The AER observed that
CitiPower’s capitalised
corporate overheads in 2014 were materially higher
than earlier years and it considered this could have been affected by
non-recurrent
factors in this year.
No incentive
mechanism applied to CitiPower’s capex in the 2011-15 regulatory control
period. Without such a mechanism, its
incentive to incur efficient capex
declined over the 2011-15 period. This meant, all else being equal, it was
incentivised to delay
its capital expenditure towards the end of the period.
There was a relatively weak incentive applying to capitalised corporate overhead
expenditure in 2014.
accepted the AER’s adjustment for capitalised corporate overheads in its
revised proposal. However, the Minister considered
it was unclear why the AER
had chosen an average of CitiPower’s 2012 to 2014 capitalised corporate
overheads. It suggested
an average of 2010 to 2014 to be preferable because it
would be equivalent to applying an efficiency sharing scheme. It also noted
was consistent with the way the AER applied the service target performance
incentive scheme (
AER said in its Distribution Determination that the methodology used when
forecasting was a matter of judgment. If it used an
average of historical costs,
the longer the period the greater the risk was that it would be taking into
account information which
was no longer relevant - such as the growth in
customer numbers, change in regulatory requirements or efficient wage levels. In
instance, the AER said, it was its judgment that a three-year average was
sufficient to ensure that the adjustment for CitiPower’s
overheads was not unduly influenced by non-recurrent factors. It did not
consider its adjustment needed to replicate the
outcomes if an efficiency
sharing scheme were in place, or its opex forecasting approach needed to be
consistent with how STPIS targets
relation to Powercor, the AER adopted the same approach and reasoning: see
Attachment 7, at 7-45 of that Distribution Determination.
The Minister’s submissions to the Tribunal
and Powercor did not challenge that decision.
Minister submitted to the Tribunal that the
National Electricity Rules
) required DNSPs to submit a proposed CAM to the AER for
approval, which set out the principles and policies by which a DNSP proposed
allocate costs between different categories of services for regulatory purposes:
rr 6.15.4 and 11.17.5. The CAM proposed must
give effect to and be consistent
with the Cost Allocation Guidelines made and published by the AER (rr 6.15.3 and
11.17.4), which
in turn must give effect to and be consistent with the Cost
Allocation Principles (as set out in r 6.15.2).
were required to comply with the CAM which applied to them and had been approved
by the AER: r 6.15.1. In particular:
building block proposal must include the total forecast opex and capex for the
relevant regulatory control period which
the DNSP considers is required to
achieve each of the opex and capex objectives (respectively): rr 6.5.6(a) and
6.5.7(a); and
these forecasts
must, among other things, be for expenditure that is properly allocated to
standard control services in accordance
with the principles and policies set out
in the CAM for the DNSP: rr 6.5.6(b) and 6.5.7(b).
Minister submitted to the Tribunal that pursuant to r 6.15.4(f) of the
, both CitiPower and Powercor sought AER approval of a revised cost
allocation method which the AER granted on 17 October 2014. Both
providers sought that the amount to be expensed be fixed by reference to the
amount for corporate overheads in the year 2014,
which was materially higher
than in previous years.
use by the AER of an average of capitalised overheads over a three-year period
from 2012-2014 resulted in a higher figure than
if the full five-year period had
response to the preliminary decisions for CitiPower and Powercor, the
Minister’s January 2016 submission to the AER raised
that the AER had only
averaged capitalised overheads over the 2012-2014 period rather than the entire
period of the previous regulatory
control period, being from 2010-2014. The
Minister argued that the AER should adjust base opex using an average of
capitalised overheads
for the entire 2010-2014 period, given that no efficiency
sharing scheme applied to capital expenditure in that regulatory control
meaning that the incentives for efficiency gains were greater at the start of a
regulatory control period. The Minister also
argued this would be equivalent to
the way STPIS targets were rolled forward.
Minister’s grounds for review relevant to this issue were as
: The AER’s decision to adjust base
opex using an average of capitalised overheads for the three-year period from
rather than the full five-years of the previous regulatory
control period, was unreasonable having regard to all the circumstances
the AER’s exercise of discretion in this respect was incorrect having
regard to all the circumstances because:
(a) the AER’s decision results in an adjustment to base opex which is
higher than would be the case if an adjustment were made
based on averaging
capitalised overheads for the full five years of the previous regulatory control
(b) the AER did not address the Minister’s submission that, in the absence
of an efficiency sharing scheme, a DNSP’s
incentives for efficiency gains
are greater at the start of a regulatory control period;
(c) there may be ‘non-recurrent factors’ equally applicable to all
years of a regulatory control period, not just the
first two years. Excluding
the first two years on that basis is not logical;
(d) asserting it is simply a matter of ‘judgment’ is contrary to
section 16(1)(d) [of the
] whereby the AER is required to make the
decision that is the preferable reviewable regulatory decision and specify the
to the basis on which the AER is satisfied that the decision is the
preferable reviewable regulatory decision.
Minister contended that the Tribunal making a determination pursuant to s 71P to
vary the Final Decision, or set it aside and
remit the matter back to the AER,
on these grounds, would or be likely to result in a “materially preferable
NEO decision”
having regard to the long term interests of consumers in
(a) the period of averaging, if set at five years, would
reduce the amount charged to consumers;
(b) the period of averaging, if set at three years and if the balance first two
years was kept by CitiPower and Powercor, results
in CitiPower and Powercor
receiving monies that should be more properly the consumers’ over the
2016–2010 regulatory
control period.
Minister submitted that the AER misstated her position in making the Final
Decisions. The Minister submitted she did not suggest
that averaging capitalised
corporate overheads over the period 2010-2014 would be the equivalent to
applying an efficiency sharing
scheme. Rather, her point was that, in the
absence of an efficiency sharing scheme for capex in the 2010-2014 period, the
of the DNSPs to achieve efficiency in capex were greater at the start
of a regulatory control period (as was acknowledged by the
AER). By averaging
capitalised corporate overheads over the three year period 2012-2014, the AER
only took into account the years
in which the DNSPs had a lesser incentive to
achieve efficiency in corporate overhead costs. In doing so, the AER allowed a
positive adjustment in base opex than would have been generated by
averaging corporate overheads over the entire 2010-2014 period,
unreasonably
skewing the adjustment in favour of CitiPower and Powercor by a material
Minister submitted that if the AER decision were not set aside, CitiPower and
Powercor would receive a windfall gain without there
being any commensurate
benefit for consumers in terms of the NEO. In particular, there would be no
commensurate benefit in terms
of quality, safety, reliability or security of
supply. There would be however a detriment to consumers in terms of the price
by consumers, ie a price that was higher than it should be. What was really
no more than a change in accounting practice should not
be allowed to have this
effect: and that it had this effect spoke to there being a materially preferable
NEO decision arising from
setting aside the AER decision.
The AER’s submissions
AER submitted that the Minister’s submission that the AER’s use of
the 3-year historical average was an incorrect
exercise of discretion, and
resulted in the AER making an unreasonable decision, in all the circumstances,
should be rejected. The
AER’s choice to average the historical corporate
overheads over the 3-year period was an exercise of regulatory judgment and
any event, the AER submitted, the difference between applying a 3-year or a
5-year historical averaging period did not materially
affect either CitiPower
and Powercor’s opex allowances, or their aggregate revenue allowances
under their distribution determinations.
The AER submitted that a comparison
between the adjustment for capitalised corporate overhead expenditure initially
proposed by CitiPower/Powercor,
as finally determined by the AER, and as
contended for by the Minister,
Initial proposal
Final decision
Minister’s proposed revision
relation to the Minister’s first complaint, ground 7(a), the AER submitted
that the fact that the outcome of the forecasting
method applied by the AER was
different to some alternative outcome did not, of itself, establish that the AER
exercised its discretion
incorrectly, or that the decision as a whole was
unreasonable in all the circumstances.
relation to the Minister’s second complaint, ground 7(b), the AER
submitted that the criticism was unfounded. What the AER
set out at Attachment
7, 7-46, was simply another way of stating the Minister’s proposition.
Plainly the AER was aware of the
proposition and took it into account. In
addition, the AER expressly noted the Minister’s submissions regarding
sharing schemes and provided two responses. The AER submitted that it
did not mischaracterise or misunderstand the Minister’s
submission.
relation to the Minister’s third complaint, ground 7(c), the AER submitted
this ground was not elaborated upon in the Minister’s
submissions and the
basis for the assertion of illogicality was unclear. It was plainly the case
that, as the AER reasoned, the further
back one took an averaging period, the
less likely it was that the average will be reflective of CitiPower and
Powercor’s current
circumstances at the outset of the 2016-2020 period. In
light of the identified and unchallenged risks associated with using data
was no longer relevant, it was not illogical for the AER to decide to use a
3-year historical average.
relation to the Minister’s fourth complaint, ground 7(d), the AER
submitted first that its obligation to make the preferable
reviewable regulatory
, s 16(1)(d)) was an obligation that related to the
distribution determination as a whole. The AER had addressed that requirement,
at the level of the distribution determinations as a whole, in the Overview to
each of the Final Decisions. It was not the case that
each decision made in the
course of determining forecast opex was itself required to be the preferable
reviewable regulatory decision.
the AER submitted, once it had decided to apply a historical average, rather
than simply accept CitiPower and Powercor’s
proposal to adopt their actual
corporate overhead expenditure in 2014, that necessarily raised the question of
what historical averaging
period should be applied instead. The appropriate
length of that averaging period was properly understood and described as a
of judgment, given that there were competing factors at play.
any event, the AER submitted, in considering the Minister’s submission for
the use of a 5-year averaging period, in the absence
of a capex incentive
scheme, it was not the case that a 2010-2014 averaging period would necessarily
have reflected stronger overall
efficiency incentives than the 2012-2014
averaging period that the AER used. This was because the two additional years
that the Minister
sought to include encompassed both the final year of the
2006-2010 regulatory control period — when the capex efficiency incentives
were weakest — and the first year of the 2011-2015 regulatory control
period — when the incentives were strongest. The
differing strengths of
the efficiency incentives in those two successive years meant there was no
obvious reason to prefer the Minister’s
proposed 5-year period to the
2012-2014 period used by the AER (which spanned the 3 middle years of the
2011-2015 regulatory control
the AER did not simply assert this was a matter of judgement without giving
reasons, as the Minister’s ground implied.
It explained the basis for its
judgement. Thus the Minister’s criticism was unfounded.
in relation to this ground, the AER submitted it was necessary to keep in mind
the nature of the constituent decision that
the AER was making under the
“reasonably reflects” formulation was plainly intended to
acknowledge that no forecast could be exact, and that the
determination of a substitute estimate of overall opex would not be incorrect or
unreasonable merely because it differed
from some other forecast amount.
this case, if the AER had estimated CitiPower and Powercor’s base
corporate overhead opex using a 5-year, rather than a 3-year,
average, it would reduce the overall 2016-2020 forecast opex:
(a) of CitiPower (total opex: $426.6
million) by $5.2 million, or 1.2%; and
(b) of Powercor (total opex: $1,181.1 million) by $6.9 million, or
Accordingly,
the AER submitted that, even if the Tribunal were of the view that the AER
should have used a 5-year historical average,
this did not demonstrate that the
AER’s assessment of the overall estimate opex requirements for CitiPower
and Powercor did
not “reasonably reflect” the opex criteria.
Moreover, the third opex criterion — a realistic expectation of the
forecast and cost inputs required to achieve the opex objectives —
underscored the need to avoid basing forecast costs
on historical expenditures
incurred under outdated demand and cost conditions.
CitiPower and Powercor’s submissions
and Powercor supported the AER’s decision. They submitted that, contrary
to the Minister’s assertion, the AER’s
decision to adjust base opex
for corporate overheads using an average of capitalised corporate overheads for
the three year period
from 2012 to 2014, rather than the five year period from
2010 to 2014, did not involve an incorrect exercise of discretion in all
circumstances and did not render the AER’s Final Decisions unreasonable in
all the circumstances.
AER did not err in determining the adjustment to base opex for corporate
overheads using an average of each of CitiPower and Powercor’s
capitalised
corporate overhead expenditure between 2012 and 2014. The AER’s exercise
of discretion was not incorrect and did
not render its Final Decisions
unreasonable for the reasons alleged by the Minister as:
(a) the relevant AER discretion was properly
characterised as being a choice of the method, more specifically the historical
period, that was best suited for use in forecasting opex on corporate
overheads for the 2016 to 2020 regulatory control period that
reflected the opex criteria, that is forecasting efficient and prudent corporate
overheads for the period, having regard
to a range of competing
considerations;
(b) the AER’s decision to strike the balance between those competing
considerations in the way that it did, by using the 2012
to 2014 historical
averaging period, was correct and reasonable, including because: it was
reasonable for the AER to conclude, and
there was no error in its conclusion,
that three years was a sufficient historical averaging period to ensure the
adjustment to base
opex for CitiPower and Powercor’s corporate overheads,
and thus forecast opex for the 2016 to 2020 regulatory control period
unduly influenced by non-recurrent factors or the relatively weak efficiency
incentives applying to capitalised corporate
overheads expenditure in 2014; and
the AER was correct to conclude that the longer the historical averaging period
adopted, the greater
the risk that information lacking in currency and relevancy
would be taken into account in forecasting future
any event, CitiPower and Powercor submitted the grounds raised by the Minister
were incapable of constituting reviewable error.
The fact that the AER’s
adjustment to base opex for CitiPower and Powercor was higher than would be the
case if the adjustment
were based on averaging capitalised overhead expenditure
over the period 2010 to 2014 did not in itself suggest any error in the
AER’s exercise of discretion, nor that the AER’s Final Decisions
were unreasonable. Nor did the AER’s failure to
expressly address the
Minister’s submission that, in the absence of an incentive scheme, a
DNSP’s incentives for efficiency
gains were greater at the start of a
regulatory control period suggest that the AER’s exercise of discretion
was incorrect
or render the Final Decisions unreasonable, including because the
AER nonetheless had express regard to the reduction in capex efficiency
incentives over the 2011-2015 regulatory control period due to the absence of
any capex incentive scheme in both its Preliminary
Determinations and Final
and Powercor submitted that the Minister’s contention, that excluding the
first two years of the Minister’s
proposed 2010 to 2014 period on the
basis of “non-recurrent factors” was illogical because those factors
were equally
applicable to all years of the period, was inapposite to the
AER’s decision. The AER’s decision was not made on the basis
asserted by the Minister. The AER’s determination not to take the average
of CitiPower and Powercor’s capitalised corporate
overheads over a five
year period was not on the basis there may be non-recurrent factors applicable
to the first two years of the
5-year period. Rather, the AER determined that a
three year average was of sufficient length to ensure that the adjustment for
overheads was not unduly influenced by non-recurrent factors and that
adopting a longer period would result in greater risk that
it would be taking
into account information which was no longer relevant for forecasting future
opex due to changed circumstances
over time, such as growth in customer numbers,
changes in regulatory requirements and the like.
to the Minister’s contention, CitiPower and Powercor submitted, the
AER’s obligation under s 16(1)(d) of the
to make the NEO
preferable decision and specify reasons for its conclusion that the decision
made was the NEO preferable decision
did not assist the Minister to establish
error or unreasonableness in the AER’s decision to use 2012 to 2014 as the
averaging period in adjusting base opex for corporate overheads
notwithstanding its discretionary nature, including because the obligation
make the NEO preferable decision, and provide reasons, applied in relation to
the overall Final Decisions, not individual constituent
decisions such as the
opex constituent decision under r 6.12.1(4) of the
or decisions
antecedent to the making of those constituent decisions such as the decision of
present concern and the Minister has
not raised any ground of review in relation
to the AER’s finding in the Final Decisions to the effect that those
determinations
were, in each instance, the NEO preferable decisions.
and Powercor submitted that AER’s decision to strike the balance between
the competing considerations in the way that
it did, by using the 2012 to 2014
historical averaging period, was reasonably open to it, and could not be said to
be incorrect or
unreasonable: it was reasonable for the AER to conclude that
three years was a sufficient period to address the identified possibility
their 2014 corporate overheads could be affected by non-recurrent expenditure
and the relatively weak incentive that it considered
applied to the their
capitalised corporate overheads in 2014. Following its consideration of the
capitalised corporate overheads
over the period 2009 to 2014 and of the evidence
before it as to the drivers of the increase in those overheads in 2014, the AER
did not conclude that the 2014 capitalised corporate overheads were affected by
non-recurrent factors but rather that they could
have been, such that they did
not have “sufficient confidence” that the use of CitiPower and
Powercor’s 2014 capitalised
corporate overheads for the adjustment to opex
would be reflective of their recurrent expenditure on corporate overheads.
the AER explained in its Preliminary Determinations, its concerns about
non-recurrent expenditure were confined to the 2014 year
because it identified
that capitalised corporate overheads increased in 2014 materially compared to
earlier years and the evidence
before the AER at the time of the Preliminary
Determinations as to the drivers of the increase in 2014 disclosed that
non-recurrent
factors might be a contributor to the increase.
and Powercor submitted it was reasonable for the AER to conclude, on the basis
of the evidence before it, that adopting
an average of capitalised corporate
overheads over 2012 to 2014 would suffice to address the effects of any
non-recurrent factors.
The Tribunal’s analysis
Tribunal finds as follows.
the following reasons, the ground of review contended for by the Minister is not
nature of the task in which the AER was engaged was to make a decision in which,
having not accepted the total of the forecast
operating expenditure for the
regulatory control period included in the current building block proposal, the
AER, having set out
its reasons for that decision, was required to set out an
estimate of the total of the DNSPs’ required opex for the regulatory
control period that the AER was satisfied reasonably reflected the operating
expenditure criteria, taking into account the operating
expenditure factors: see
r 6.12.1(4)(ii) of the
to r 6.5.6(c) of the
, the AER’s task was to satisfy itself that
the total of the forecast operating expenditure for the regulatory control
reasonably reflected each of the following (the operating expenditure
(1) the efficient costs of achieving the operating
expenditure objectives; and
(2) the costs that a prudent operator would require to achieve the operating
expenditure objectives: and
(3) a realistic expectation of the demand forecast and cost inputs required to
achieve the operating expenditure objectives.
Tribunal notes that the Minister’s grounds of review did not claim that
the AER made an error of fact, or more than one
error of fact, in its findings
does not establish reviewable error to say no more than that the AER’s
decision resulted in an adjustment to base opex which
was higher than would be
the case if an adjustment were made based on averaging capitalised overheads for
the full five years of
the previous regulatory control period. We do not accept
the Minister’s first ground.
do we accept the Minister’s second ground, that the AER did not address
the substance of the Minister’s submission
that in the absence of an
efficiency sharing scheme, a DNSP’s incentives for efficiency gains were
greater at the start of
a regulatory control period.
Minister’s third ground was there may be “non-recurrent
factors” equally applicable to all years of a regulatory
control period,
not just the first two years. Excluding the first two years on that basis, it
was submitted, was not logical. However,
in our opinion, the AER did not make a
reviewable error in identifying risks associated with using data that was no
longer relevant
and it was not illogical for the AER to decide to use a 3-year
historical average. There was no reviewable error in concluding that
year average was sufficiently long so that the adjustment for corporate
overheads was not unduly influenced by non-recurrent
do not accept the Minister’s fourth ground, that the AER asserted that the
issue was simply a matter of “judgement”.
The AER gave reasons for
its conclusion. In our opinion, there was no reviewable error in the AER’s
observation that its conclusion
was a matter of judgement, in the sense of
making a choice between choices available to it. We accept the AER’s
that the appropriate length of the averaging period was properly
understood and described as a matter of judgement, given that there
competing factors at play.
reject the submission that the AER’s approach in this respect was contrary
to s 16(1)(d) of the
. That provision requires the AER, where
there are 2 or more possible reviewable regulatory decisions that will or are
likely to contribute
to the achievement of the NEO, to make the decision that
the AER is satisfied will or is likely to contribute to the achievement
NEO to the greatest degree (referred to in the
“preferable reviewable regulatory decision”). As the Full Court
explained in
Australian Energy Regulator v Australian Competition Tribunal
[2017] FCAFC 79
, in so providing, the legislature
is making express, perhaps unnecessarily, the content of what is preferable.
summary, the grounds of review in relation to CitiPower’s and
Powercor’s corporate overheads are not made out.
LABOUR PRICE GROWTH ISSUE
Introduction
we have said, CitiPower and Powercor submitted the AER erred in rejecting their
proposed labour price growth rate for 2016 based
on their existing enterprise
agreement outcomes and determining a labour price growth rate for 2016 based on
the average of two forecasts
of the rate of change in the wage price index for
the Victorian electricity, gas, water and waste services (utilities) industry.
26 August 2016, the Tribunal granted CitiPower and Powercor leave to apply for
review in respect of their grounds for review in
respect of that matter.

What the AER decided
AER’s decision on this issue was as follows.
its Overview of the CitiPower Final Decision, the AER said, at pages 29-30, its
forecast of the overall rate of change used to
derive its alternative estimate
of opex was lower than CitiPower’s estimate over the forecast period. This
was due largely
to the difference between how the AER and CitiPower had forecast
labour price growth over the regulatory control period. The AER
said (omitting
footnotes):
To forecast labour price growth, CitiPower used wage
increases in its existing enterprise agreement until their expiry, and then used
Frontier Economics' recommended extrapolation of long term enterprise agreements
from a comparator group of service providers. CitiPower’s
forecast is
higher than ours, which we base on forecasts of growth in the utilities WPI from
Deloitte Access Economics and CIE. The
reasons for our approach are discussed
below (see box 2).
CitiPower identified a number of cost drivers that it considers will require
increased opex over the forecast period. We refer to
these cost drivers as
possible ‘step changes’. Step changes may be for cost drivers such
as new, changed or removed regulatory
obligations, or efficient capex/opex
trade-offs. We typically compensate a network business for step changes only if
efficient base
year opex, and the rate of change in opex of an efficient service
provider, do not already compensate the business for the proposed
CitiPower proposed $23.9 million for step changes in its revised proposal, of
which we have accepted $12.8 million. We have included
step changes in our final
decision opex forecast for the following proposals:
Customer relationship management system
Mobile devices
RIN compliance
Introduction of chapter 5A.
These step changes relate to the costs of complying with
new or changed regulatory obligations or efficient capex/opex trade
2, as referred to, was as follows (omitting a footnote):
recasting labour
price growth
Forecast labour price growth is a component of the opex
rate of change. We forecast labour price growth as part of our opex forecast
account for changes in prices over time.
To forecast labour price growth, we use the forecast change in the wage price
index (WPI) for the electricity, gas, water and waste
services industry (the
utilities industry).
For these decisions, we have used forecasts of Victorian utilities WPI growth by
Deloitte Access Economics (DAE) and the Centre for
International Economics
(CIE). We consider the average of these forecasts represents a realistic
expectation of the cost inputs required
to achieve the opex objectives. This is
because these forecasts are forward looking, draw on current market information
from multiple
sources, and account for important drivers of labour price growth
(including enterprise agreements).
CitiPower and Powercor adopted a different approach to ours to forecast labour
price growth. CitiPower proposed a hybrid forecasting
method based
the annualised wage growth rates in its enterprise
agreements for the period up until the expiry of those agreements
the five year historical average enterprise agreement wage growth rate for all
privately owned electricity networks as calculated
by Frontier Economics for the
period after the expiry of its current agreements.
We are not satisfied that CitiPower's forecast of labour
price growth represents a realistic expectation of the cost inputs required
achieve the opex objectives because:
CitiPower's backward looking historic average forecasting
approach does not account for the labour market conditions expected to
in the forecast period. We note that wage price growth for the utilities
industry and the economy as a whole is currently
the lowest on record.
CitiPower's labour price forecasting approach does not account for the impact
this would have on labour price
growth over the forecast period.
CitiPower did not use the same forecasting approach for all years of the
forecast period. We consider this hybrid forecasting method
would result in an
upwardly biased total forecast of labour price growth over the regulatory
control period.
We do not consider compliance with enterprise agreements or
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth) is a regulatory obligation or requirement as defined in
section 2D of the National Electricity Law (NEL). The Tribunal recently
considered this matter following applications by the NSW/ACT businesses. The AER
has sought review of the Tribunal’s decision
in the Federal
We also consider that adopting the wage rate increases
in an individual firm's enterprise agreements would reduce the incentive to
negotiate efficient wages. If a firm is confident that we will use the wage rate
increases in its enterprise agreements to forecast
price growth then it has no
incentive to minimise those wage increases, as they will be passed through to
consumers. This outcome
would be inconsistent with the ex ante incentive-based
regulatory framework under the NER.
pages 34-35, the AER said services were classified as either “direct
control”, “negotiated” or “unregulated”
Direct control services were services were the AER directly controlled prices by
setting a revenue cap on the prices a
distributor may charge. These services can
be further split by “standard control” and “alternative
services. The AER’s decision on the forms of regulation to
apply to standard control and alternative control services was outlined
following section. Standard control services are services that are central to
electricity supply and therefore relied on by
most (if not all) customers.
Alternative control services are customer specific or customer requested
services. Figure 9 summarised
the AER’s decision on service classification
for CitiPower for the 2016–20 regulatory control period.
pages 23-24 of Attachment 7, the AER said:
We are not satisfied that CitiPower’s forecast of
labour price growth reasonably reflects a realistic expectation of the cost
inputs or the efficient costs that a prudent operator would require to achieve
the opex objectives.
This is because CitiPower's approach of using its current EA and an historical
average of other EAs does not account for the broader
labour market conditions
expert economic forecasters expect to prevail in the forecast period. Further,
CitiPower's forecasting approach
which uses two sources of forecasts over the
2016–20 regulatory control period is likely to result in an upwardly
biased total
forecast of labour price growth over the regulatory control period.
CitiPower’s forecast is higher than ours, which we base
on forecasts of
growth in the utilities WPI from Deloitte Access Economics and CIE.
Consequently, our forecast of price growth is
on average 0.83 percentage points
lower than CitiPower’s forecast.
We are satisfied that this approach to forecasting labour price growth
reasonably reflects a realistic expectation of the labour
price growth faced by
a prudent and efficient firm over the regulatory control period. This forward
looking approach draws on available
current market information from multiple
sources, including from enterprise agreements (EAs), on the expected changes to
the drivers
of labour price.
7 contained the AER’s discussion of its assessment of forecast labour
price growth for CitiPower. That attachment
set out more detail about each of
the steps the AER followed in developing its alternative estimate. Step 1 was
base year choice;
step 2 was assessing base opex; step 3 was the rate of change
including price growth (including the price of labour), output growth
productivity growth; step 4 was step changes and step 5 was other costs not
included in the base year.
page 56 of Attachment 7, the AER said:
As noted above, there are four key reasons why we cannot
accept CitiPower's forecast. The first is CitiPower's approach is not forward
looking and it does not consider broader labour market conditions. The second is
because CitiPower's approach is inconsistent with
incentives to promote economic
efficiency. The third is because CitiPower's hybrid approach is likely to be
upwardly biased. Finally,
CitiPower's approach relies on an incorrect
interpretation of ‘regulatory obligation or
requirement’.
elaboration of these key reasons followed at pages 57-75. At page 75, the AER
When we are not satisfied a DNSP's total forecast opex
reasonably reflects the opex criteria, the NER require that we develop our
estimate. Given we disagree with CitiPower's proposed rate of change, we must
estimate a forecast of labour price growth that
reasonably reflects a realistic
expectation of the cost inputs that a prudent and efficient operator would
AER adopted the same approach in relation to Powercor: see the Overview and the
corresponding Box 2 at pages 30-31. Again, the
corresponding Attachment 7
contained the AER’s discussion of its assessment of forecast of labour
price growth for Powercor.
CUAC’s submissions to the Tribunal
Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre (
now the Consumer Policy
Research Centre
, submitted that the inefficiency of the 2016 wage
growth rates provided for in the enterprise agreements (
demonstrated by a comparison with the WPI for all industries, as well as the for
the Victorian electricity, gas, water and waste
services (utilities) industry
wage price index (
), which both CitiPower and Powercor had
accepted as an appropriate basis for the forecast for the 2017-20 regulatory
years. It was
submitted that the CitiPower and Powercor EAs demonstrated stable
annual wage growth rates of 4.5%-4.55% from 2011 to and including
2016, while
wage price indices across all industries, including the utilities industry, were
declining. Adopting the inefficient
growth rates provided for in the EAs for the
2016 year would not result in a materially preferable NEO decision as claimed by
and Powercor. On the contrary, it would undermine the long-term
interests of consumers in several ways. CUAC contended that the AER
was correct
to reject CitiPower and Powercor’s proposed growth rates for 2016 as set
out in the EAs, as they were inefficient
at the time they were struck. A chart
taken from the AER’s Final Decision for CitiPower at page 7-60 compared
the average annual
wage increase in newly negotiated EAs since 1998. It
illustrated the trend in EAs over time for different sectors and for the overall
wage price index as measured by the ABS. It demonstrated that the wage price
index had declined quite dramatically since 2011 and
that specific industries,
including the utilities industry, had also tracked downwards albeit with a
slight delay. A further chart
created for CUAC showed quarterly changes in the
ABS data for wage price index and the utilities wage price index since 2008. The
ABS trend for all industries showed a declining wage price index since 2008. A
simple regression of ABS utilities data indicated
a similar trend. However, an
examination of CitiPower’s historical EAs from 2011 showed no such
decline. The figures were similar
for Powercor. While it may have been
reasonable to forecast higher than average wage growth in the utilities sector
during the period
when the 2011 to 2013 EAs were being negotiated, the same
could not be said of the period when the 2013 to 2016 EAs were
negotiated.
The Applicants’ submissions
summary, CitiPower and Powercor submitted to the Tribunal as follows.
complaint was focused on the rejection by the AER of the forecasts only insofar
as they were built on the existing EAs: it was
only the forecast for 2016 that
CitiPower and Powercor complained of. Although it did have consequences for
later years, because
later years built on the growth in 2016, there was no
complaint, as part of these proceedings, about the percentage growth forecast
the manner in which those forecasts were developed by the AER for the years 2017
through to 2020.
of the obligations and requirements imposed on CitiPower and Powercor by the EAs
to which they were bound was a “regulatory
obligation or
requirement” within the meaning of s 2D of the
relevant question was whether the EAs (taken as a whole) “materially
affect” the provision of electricity network
services by Citipower and
to the Tribunal decision in
Application by SA Power Networks
, CitiPower and Powercor submitted there was no requirement for a
“direct” or “unique” connection between
the EA and the
provision of the services. The Tribunal’s decision in
was wrong in law. Entry into the EAs was not a simple matter of
managerial choice, and the AER erred in fact in so finding. The EAs
substantially determined what CitiPower and Powercor’s labour price growth
would be in 2016. It was submitted there was no
meaningful parallel between EAs
and an ordinary contract. It would be wrong to conclude that, because the terms
and conditions of
an EA were the subject of negotiation, the making of EAs was
within the control of management. The making of EAs was governed by
prescriptive regime in
Fair Work Act
Act provided that a person must not contravene a term of an EA. The section was
a civil remedy provision and exposed the
employer to a pecuniary penalty if it
contravened an EA.
AER should have, but failed, to give independent consideration to the 2016
regulatory year and there was no impropriety in CitiPower
and Powercor
challenging only that aspect of the labour price growth decision.
AER’s decision allowed CitiPower and Powercor substantially less than the
labour price growth under the EAs. This was said
to be an error insofar as the
AER allowed an increase of less than the labour price growth under the EAs, as
that would be less than
the actual labour price growth increases that these
entities would face. The increase in the method produced by the AER did not
for the wage increases in the current EAs.
was an incorrect exercise of discretion because it was based upon a
misconstruction of s 2D of the
or alternatively, the AER exercised its discretion incorrectly because in
failing to take account of the labour price growth
under the EAs it misconstrued
the opex and capex objectives and opex and capex criteria in rr 6.5.6 and 6.5.7
or in the alternative, CitiPower and Powercor submitted that they acted
efficiently and prudently in entering into the EAs
and there was no basis to
conclude that the EAs did not reflect efficient labour price growth for 2016.
The AER instead relied upon
“broader labour market conditions” in
forecasting CitiPower and Powercor’s labour price growth for 2016. That
was erroneous because “broader labour market conditions”
were irrelevant in circumstances where price growth was substantially
by the EAs.
any event, CitiPower and Powercor submitted, the AER’s measure of
“broader labour market conditions”, namely
the EGWW WPI was not a
good comparator for CitiPower and Powercor, primarily because of the specialised
skills of their employees,
the Electrical Trades Union (
) monopoly on
the market for supply of skilled electrical services labour, and the
vulnerability of CitiPower and Powercor to industrial
action by the ETU.
AER erred in refusing to accept CitiPower and Powercor’s forecast labour
price growth for 2016 on the basis that this would
impact on a DNSP’s
incentives to negotiate for efficient labour price growth. There was ample
incentive in the regulatory regime
for a DNSP to negotiate efficient labour
price growth. The AER’s approach, by contrast, distorted incentives by
encouraging
low labour price growth even in circumstances where that is not the
most efficient course overall.
and Powercor submitted that the AER’s rejection of their forecast labour
price growth for 2016 on the basis that it
involved a hybrid forecasting method
was illogical.
AER wrongly concluded that for CitiPower and Powercor’s forecast not to be
upwardly biased, its wage rates would need to
be lower than the industry average
in 2014 and that none of the evidence suggested that to be the case. There was
ample evidence
that a downwards efficiency adjustment in 2017 would not be
and Powercor submitted the AER’s approach was inconsistent because the AER
accepted that CitiPower and Powercor were
among the most efficient DNSPs in
Australia, and adopted their revealed base-year opex as the basis for their opex
forecasts, but
did not allow CitiPower and Powercor to recover their (efficient)
revealed costs of labour escalation under their EAs. Contrary to
submission, this submission was raised by CitiPower and Powercor before the AER
and was not precluded by s 71O of
AER failed to but should have taken account, in assessing an allowance for 2016
labour price growth, the fact that its forecast
of 2017-2020 labour price growth
was likely to undercompensate CitiPower and Powercor because it had used
downwardly biased estimates
of Victorian EGWW WPI.
Attachment A to the submissions of CitiPower and Powercor in reply, they
provided an illustrative example of the incentive effects
of the efficiency
benefit sharing scheme (
) on their commercial incentive to minimise
labour price growth in negotiating their existing EAs.
oral submissions, CitiPower and Powercor submitted that none of the provisions
of the rules were specifically and separately addressed
to the subject of labour
price growth. Labour price growth fed into the building block proposal as an
integer, but it was not an
aspect of the rules that something specific had to be
done in relation to labour price growth. That was true on a year-by-year basis
or in relation to the totals for labour price growth over the 5-year regulatory
control period.
and Powercor submitted that the benchmarking showed that they were the most
efficient distributors. One of their fundamental
complaints was that, being the
most efficient distributors, they were not getting the labour price growth they
said was associated
with the efficiencies that had been achieved.
to s 2D of the
, CitiPower and Powercor submitted that the relevant
inquiry was not about whether a specific obligation materially affected the
of electricity, but whether the Act or the instrument materially affected
the supply of electricity services. Then there was an inquiry
as to whether or
not the act or obligation comes under the Act or instrument. That was an
important distinction because the AER submitted
the relevant obligation was the
wage increase and the question then became whether that wage increase materially
affected the supply
of electricity network services. If that point were reached,
CitiPower and Powercor submitted they still succeeded because the payment
wages or a wage increase was something that materially affected the supply of
electricity network services. CitiPower and Powercor
submitted that the AER was
wrong to reason that if anything materially affected the provision of network
services (which was denied),
it was the DNSP’s own decision to enter into
the agreement. CitiPower and Powercor submitted the Tribunal erred in
Power Networks
in concluding that obligations under EAs were not regulatory
obligations under the Act. If the AER was wrong about “materially
affect”, it was necessarily also wrong in concluding that the EBAs or the
Act were not associated with the provision of standard
control services.
summary, in relation to s 2D of the
, CitiPower and Powercor submitted
that the AER was wrong: in concluding that the EAs or the Act were not
regulatory obligations or
requirements; in concluding that compliance with the
EAs was not an operating expenditure objective, or a capital expenditure
in concluding that the costs incurred to comply with the EAs were not
consistent with the opex objectives and the capex objectives;
including those costs when it made its own estimation of the total required opex
and capex. All those errors, they submitted,
stem from the misconstruction and
the misapplication of the
, and that error resulted in the applicants
receiving a capex allowance and an opex allowance that was less than the amount
reasonably required to meet the opex objectives and the capex
objectives, meaning that the revenue and pricing principles were
The AER’s submissions
AER submitted, in summary, as follows.
matter under review was one aspect of the AER’s decision estimating total
required opex and capex under r 6.12.1(3)(ii)
and (4)(ii) of the
namely, the labour component of the overall price growth rate for 2016. The
asserted error related to its decision to adopt a labour
price growth rate for
the 2016 regulatory year based on a simple average of the forecasts of the rate
of change of Victorian electricity,
gas, water, waste services, WPI, prepared by
each of the AE and CIE. The challenge was to the AER’s estimate based upon
methodology.
arguments of CitiPower and Powercor proceeded on the premise that the wage
increase rate under their EAs was the appropriate escalator
to use for the
labour price growth forecast, because the EAs applied to a large part of their
labour cost. The evidence for that
premise was very weak.
response to alleged error 1, that it did not properly construe the
, the AER submitted the opex criteria did not compel it to
include the EA wage increase rate for 2016 in the estimate of required
capex. The AER submitted that wage increase obligations under EAs were not
obligations or requirements that “materially
affect the provision of ...
electricity network services”.
response to alleged error 2, that its approach involved taking into account
irrelevant considerations by taking into account broader
labour market
conditions in the forecast period (in respect of labour price growth forecast
for 2016), the AER submitted that broader
labour market conditions were not an
irrelevant consideration to the AER’s decision.
response to alleged error 3, that it made a number of errors in taking the view
that adopting wage rate increases in an individual
firm’s EAs would not
provide effective incentives in order to promote economic efficiency through the
negotiation of efficient
wages, the AER submitted it was not illogical, or
otherwise an error, for the AER to consider the impact on efficiency incentives
from adopting a service provider’s EA wage rate increase.
response to alleged error 4, that it erred in disagreeing with CitiPower and
Powercor’s proposed hybrid methodology for forecasting
labour price growth
over the regulatory period, the AER submitted it was not illogical, or otherwise
an error, for the AER to prefer
a single forecast methodology across the
regulatory control period, rather than a hybrid methodology.
response to alleged error 5, that its opex decision was internally inconsistent,
the AER submitted it did not follow that, because
CitiPower and Powercor’s
overall opex was benchmarked as comparatively efficient between 2006 and 2014,
that the EA wage increase
rate for 2016 was necessarily efficient.
response to alleged error 6, that its decision with respect to the 2016 labour
price growth rate was likely to under compensate
CitiPower and Powercor, the AER
submitted CitiPower and Powercor’s arguments concerning under compensation
were a statement
of conclusion, rather than a statement of error, and related to
the years 2017-2020 which were not the subject of review. Requiring
an automatic
allowance for the 2016 EA wage increase rate would not result in a decision that
would promote efficiency for the long-term
interests of consumers in a
materially preferable way.
AER provided a written response to the illustrative example given by CitiPower
and Powercor of the incentive effects of the EBSS.
oral submissions, the AER submitted that the contention by CitiPower and
Powercor was that the AER erred when making its own estimate
of required opex
and required capex and the error was by not adopting the wage increase rates
under the EAs for the 2016 year. The
applicants did not challenge the
immediately preceding decision of the AER not to accept the opex forecast
proposed by them and,
in particular, they did not challenge the AER’s
decision not to accept their labour price growth forecasting method for 2017
2020. The AER was considering the proposal put forward by CitiPower and
Powercor, which was their combined methodology for the
whole period. And that
gave rise to some unfairness in the criticism made by them of the AER’s
decision. The argument of CitiPower
and Powercor must ultimately be that the
proper application of the
required the AER to use the EA wage
increase rate for 2016, and therefore the AER erred in choosing a different
methodology to make
its forecast.
AER submitted that the ground of review was that it was wrong to base its
estimate on utilities’ wage price index for the
whole period. However what
the AER was doing was seeking to strike an escalator that was suitable for
labour broadly defined, which
was more than employees, employees under EAs or
total employees, and also included contractors for field work. The AER was
to derive a suitable escalator for the labour price growth for that
fairly large category. The applicants said the AER was wrong
to choose the
utilities wage price index. They said that, really, a proper application of the
ought to have led the AER to use the enterprise agreement wage
increase rate for 2016. The central argument was that the AER was
compelled by
to use the wage increase rate under the EAs in deriving the
labour component of the price growth forecast within the overall opex
It did not necessarily follow that that was the right total escalator for the
labour price growth forecast and some further
investigation might need to be
done as to how far the impacts of the EAs really flowed.
AER submitted that if the applicants’ construction of the legislation was
correct, the AER’s ability to assess the
efficiency and prudence of a
service provider’s labour costs, if those labour costs were incurred under
an EA, was substantially
reduced. If the wage rates and the wage increase rates
under an EA were regulatory obligations, then the effect of these provisions
seemed to be that the AER must allow those rates.
AER submitted, with reference to
of Sch 2 to the
construction of s 2D(1)(b)(v), on which the applicants relied, was not a
construction that best advanced the purposes of
the law reflected in the NEO.
The NEO was advanced if the AER was able to assess the efficiency and prudency
of labour costs, regardless
of whether they were incorporated into EAs or
otherwise. The AER submitted there were two main disagreements between the
in respect of construction. The first area of disagreement was what do
the qualifying words “that materially affects the provision,”
actually qualify? Do they only qualify an Act, or do they qualify an obligation
or requirement under an Act? The second area of disagreement
was what the words
“materially affect” meant.
to the first area of disagreement, the AER submitted the definition was
concerned with regulatory obligations of a certain kind,
plainly, and the
purpose of the definition was to define those obligations. Those obligations
were defined with some specificity,
being obligations that have the
characteristics that were set out in each of the sub-paragraphs. Relevantly for
(v), it was an obligation
or requirement that materially affected the provision
by a regulated network service provider of electricity network services. On
applicants’ construction, the obligations were much more at large. It was
difficult to discern a statutory purpose for
defining regulatory obligations or
requirements in the manner for which the applicants contended. In contrast,
there was an obvious
statutory purpose for defining the regulatory obligations
in a more specific manner that pointed attention to specific obligations,
obligations that materially affected the provision by a regulated network
service provider of electricity network services.
to the second area of disagreement, the AER submitted it was necessary to
identify the relevant obligations under the EA and consider
whether the relevant
obligations materially affected the provision of network services. The word
“material” had an important
evaluative role within the paragraph and
ought to be given work. Therefore the relevant question was whether the wage
increase rate
of 4.5 per cent which appeared in the EA for 2016 materially
affected the provision of network services. Would there be any material
affectation of the provision of electricity network services if the wage
increase rate had been, say, 2.5 per cent, 3.5 per cent,
4.5 per cent or 5.5 per
cent? The AER submitted there was no reason to draw the conclusion that that
wage increase rate had a material
effect on the provision of network services.
to other terms of the EAs that the applicants submitted affected the provision
of network services, such as provisions relating
to tools, or working in adverse
weather, and those sorts of matters, a question still arose: was that really
material affectation
of the provision of network services? In what way, and to
what extent, and could it be seen and determined that they necessarily
the provision of network services? If those provisions were not in the EA, would
there be any material difference to the
provision of network services? Could it
be seen that without those provisions there would be some kind of difference to
the provision
of network services?
did not follow, the AER submitted, from the obvious fact that labour of some
kind was needed by a service provider, that one particular
method of engaging
the labour materially affected the provision of network services. There was
something of a slide from speaking
provide network services, to moving to labour employed under EAs materially
affecting the
provision of those services. In
SA Power Networks
Tribunal was saying that the mere observation of a cost did not logically
suggest that the thing under which the cost was incurred
materially affects the
provision of network services. The obligation for the cost itself was not truly
causing a material affectation
of the provision of network services.
to the allegations of error in the AER’s reasoning aside from the rules,
the applicants’ submission was that broader
labour market conditions were
not relevant to the labour price growth that the applicants would face for the
2016 year and, therefore,
the AER took into account an irrelevant consideration
in taking into account that factor: because it was not relevant to 2016,
it was an irrelevant factor.
AER submitted there were at least three difficulties with the argument. The
first was that the applicants criticised part of the
AER’s reasons that
were directed to the whole of the forecasting methodology advanced by the
applicants, not merely the 2016
year. The second difficulty with the argument
was that it ignored other aspects of the AER’s reasons, why the AER
the use of the 2016 wage increase rate, and that particularly related
to the hybrid methodology issue which sat over the whole of
the rejection of the
applicants’ forecast methodology: that was a significant reason why the
AER did not agree with the totality
of the methodology advanced and splitting
the methodology with one approach for 2016 and another for the other years. The
third difficulty
was that it did not necessarily lead to a conclusion that there
was relevant error in the (hybrid) methodology that was ultimately
the AER under its own estimate.
to internal consistency, the AER submitted there was no necessary logical
relationship between historical opex efficiency and future
opex efficiency.
Although the AER did determine that CitiPower’s and Powercor’s base
year opex in 2014 remained at efficient
levels, it was still necessary for the
AER to look to the forecast period. It was making a forecast and it needed to
make an estimate
of the efficient rate of real price growth, one component of
which was labour and which had to be applied to the full breadth of
labour costs
that the AER took into account. It had to form a view about that for the
forecasting period. The AER submitted that
the mere fact that CitiPower or
Powercor was generally regarded as an efficient firm as at the end of the last
regulatory period
did not provide a sound basis for necessarily concluding that
the 2016 wage increase rate in the enterprise agreement was necessarily
efficient level going forward. It may be, it may not be, it was
Further submissions
response to the decision of the Full Court in
Australian Energy Regulator v
Australian Competition Tribunal (No 2)
, the following submissions were made
by leave of the Tribunal.
CPRC (previously the CUAC) submitted that it was open for the present Tribunal
to determine whether EAs were an “applicable
regulatory obligation or
requirement”, and to do so consistently with the decision in
Application by SA Power Networks
. The decision of the Full Court
confirmed that it was open to the Tribunal to examine whether the labour price
growth rates contained
in network EAs were required to fulfil the opex objective
and, if so, whether they reasonably reflected the opex criteria. The Full
highlighted that this enquiry required an examination of all the facts and
circumstances relevant to the EAs in question. The
Full Court’s
affirmation of the reasoning of the Tribunal that the AER erred in its reliance
on the EI model to conclude that
the NSW networks’ labour management
practices were inefficient and that their EAs were an endogenous managerial
not determinative of the present proceedings, which must necessarily
turn on the AER’s particular analysis of CitiPower and
labour price growth rates. The Full Court confirmed at [371] that, standing
alone, the Tribunal’s statement
that it was the legislative intention of
Parliament that consumers bear the costs of inefficient EAs was incorrect. This
the CPRC’s contention that the AER was correct to reject
CitiPower and Powercor’s proposed growth rates for 2016 because
based on EAs that were inefficient at the time they were struck. It indicated
the relevance of the material contained in
CPRC’s submissions dated 6
October 2016 as part of the “facts and circumstances” to be examined
by the Tribunal.
The Full Court’s decision also left open for the current
Tribunal to find that regardless of whether error was established
AER’s approach, adopting the inefficient growth rates provided for in
CitiPower and Powercor’s EAs would not result
in a materially preferable
NEO decision.
and Powercor submitted that the Full Court upheld the Tribunal’s finding
that it was erroneous for the AER to have
concluded that the EAs of the New
South Wales businesses under consideration “were an endogenous managerial
choice” They
referred to pages 7-73 of each Final Decision and submitted
that the reasoning of the Full Court confirmed that this approach was
simplistic. While the AER did not expressly adopt the
“endogenous/exogenous” dichotomy criticised by the earlier
its reasoning was to the same effect. The Full Court’s reasoning supported
CitiPower and Powercor’s submissions
that it was an error of the AER to
regard EAs as the product of managerial choice akin to an ordinary contract.
CitiPower and Powercor
contended that the AER’s reasoning at each of pages
7-73 was a material error of fact. The finding was also material to the
AER’s errors in concluding that compliance with EAs was not a
“regulatory obligation or requirement” within the
meaning of s 2D of
, and that compliance with EAs did not otherwise form part of the
opex and capex objectives and criteria.
AER submitted that the decision of the Full Court did not assist in the
determination of the grounds of review: none of the findings
made by the Full
Court supported CitiPower and Powercor’s grounds of review. The
“labour cost” issue raised by
CitiPower and Powercor before this
Tribunal was different to, and much narrower than, the matters which were the
subject of consideration
by the Full Court.
The Tribunal’s analysis
address first the s 2D question. That provision is a definition section.
The term “regulatory obligation or requirement”
is to be found first
in s 7A of the
7A Revenue and pricing principles
(1) The revenue and pricing principles are the principles set out in subsections
(2) to (7).
(2) A regulated network service provider should be provided with a reasonable
opportunity to recover at least the efficient costs
the operator incurs in--
(a) providing direct control network
services; and
(b) complying with a regulatory obligation or requirement or making a regulatory
the term is relevantly found in r 6.5.6 of the
operating expenditure. By that rule, a building block proposal must include the
total forecast operating expenditure
for the relevant regulatory control period
which the DNSP considers is required in order to achieve each of the following
objectives): (2) comply with all applicable regulatory obligations or
requirements associated with the provision of standard control
services. Then,
by s 2D, a regulatory obligation or requirement is defined to be, relevantly, an
obligation or requirement under
an Act of a participating jurisdiction, or any
instrument made or issued under or for the purposes of that Act (other than
electricity legislation or an Act of a participating jurisdiction or an
Act or instrument referred to in subparagraphs (ii) to (iv)),
that materially
affects the provision, by a regulated network service provider, of electricity
network services that are the subject
of a distribution determination or
transmission determination.
the opinion of the Tribunal, on this question of construction, the wage increase
rates under the EAs of CitiPower and Powercor
are not, by s 2D, made the
appropriate escalator to use for the labour price growth forecast. Put
differently, neither the revenue
and pricing principles nor the opex objectives
meant that the AER was required to include the EAs’ wage increase rate for
in the estimate of required opex or capex.
revenue and pricing principles in s 7A(2) do not require that result, if for no
other reason than they refer not only to a principle
but also to a reasonable
opportunity to recover at least the efficient costs of complying with a
regulatory obligation or requirement.
This means there are evaluative steps
involved in taking into account the costs of complying with a regulatory
obligation or requirement
such that the EAs do not mandate their wage increase
rate as the appropriate escalator.
reach the same conclusion in relation to r 6.5.6 of the
, read with s
. We accept that there is an obligation or requirement under
an instrument under an Act of a participating jurisdiction, the Commonwealth,
but we conclude that the obligation or requirement under the EAs does not
materially affect the provision of the electricity network
services, within the
meaning of s 2D(1)(b)(v) of the
. While we do not find it necessary to
use the language used by the Tribunal, differently constituted, in
at [351], that is, the language of “real, direct and tangible
connection – one that is not remote”, or at [523]
Tribunal used the words “unique connection between the EA and the
provision of electricity network services”,
we consider that any
obligation must be regulatory so as to materially affect the provision of the
services. In our opinion, the
particular wage rate increases under the
particular EAs under the
Fair Work Act
are not of that character. In our
opinion, the connection between the EAs and the provision of the services is
insufficient to answer
the description “materially affect the provision of
the ... services”.
so concluding, we have taken into account the consideration of the nature of EAs
Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Marmara
[2014] FCAFC 84
, where the Full Court did not accept the appropriateness
of the contractual analogy. Similarly, contrary to the submissions on behalf
the AER, we do not regard as significant any element of choice in entering into
an EA, in the present context. We note also what
the Full Court said in
Toyota Motor Corporation
An enterprise agreement is a statutory artefact made by
persons specifically empowered in that regard, and under conditions specifically
set down, by the FW Act. It is enforceable under that Act, and not otherwise.
There is, in the circumstances, no reason to approach
the question of
legislative intent with a predisposition informed by notions of freedom of
follows from what we have so far said that although we do not agree with the
reasoning of the AER in relation to the issue of managerial
choice, we do not
consider that error to have been material. The Tribunal therefore finds that the
first error contended for is not
made out. For completeness we should add that
we do not accept the submission that the AER erred in the manner in which it
“independently” the 2016 regulatory year. As we read the
AER’s reasons, they were directed to the entirety of the
do we accept the submission that the AER, as a consequence of its claimed
failure to take account of the labour price growth
under the EAs, misconstrued
the opex and capex objectives and the opex and capex criteria in rr 6.5.6 and
6.5.7 of the
. As the Tribunal understood it, this submission was put
in the alternative to the “regulatory obligation or requirement”
submission but fails because it is put that “the NEL and the NER, properly
construed, require that the Applicants be compensated
for the cost of compliance
with their respective EAs, including the wage rate increases provided for in
those EAs.” In our
view there is no such requirement. Contrary to the
submissions of the applicants, compliance with EAs is not otherwise required to
achieve the opex objective and capex objective of maintaining the safety of the
distribution system through the supply of standard
control services (rr
6.5.6(a)(4) and 6.5.7(a)(4)), and the cost of compliance with EAs does not
reasonably reflect a realistic expectation
of the cost inputs required to
achieve the opex objectives and the capex objectives (rr 6.5.6(c)(3) and
6.5.7(c)(3)). The AER considered
these issues and no error has been made out in
that respect.
second claimed error was that the AER erred in relying on “broader labour
market conditions” in forecasting labour
price growth for 2016. The
applicants submitted that broader labour market conditions were relevant for the
period after 2016 because
there was no EA in place for those years but for 2016
broader labour market conditions were irrelevant. The applicants submitted
what was relevant was to consider the EAs, recognise that they had mandated
increases, consider whether they were prudent and
efficient and represented
reasonable costs, and that was not done: the broader labour market conditions
did not really assist in
that inquiry, it was submitted. The contention was that
the reasoning was erroneous, there was a failure to take into account relevant
considerations in relation to 2016, being the EAs and whether they were
efficient and prudent and that led ultimately to errors of
discretion and
unreasonableness.
Tribunal does not accept the premise that “broader labour market
conditions” were irrelevant considerations in light
of the EAs or at all.
In our opinion it was not erroneous reasoning on the part of the AER to say that
using the current EA and an
average of other EAs did not account for the broader
labour market conditions economic forecasters expected to prevail in the
forecasting
period. Similarly, there is no erroneous reasoning in using
forecasts of growth in the utilities WPI from Deloitte and CIE. The AER
making its own assessment of relevant forecasts for the regulatory period and
was entitled to consider external benchmarks.
Tribunal does not accept the submission that because broader labour market
conditions were not relevant to the labour price growth
the applicants faced for
the 2016 year therefore the AER taking into account those conditions was the
taking into account of an irrelevant
consideration. In our view, that could not
be so once it is discerned that the AER’s reasons were as to the whole of
the forecasting
methodology, and were not limited to the 2016 year.
note that, as described by Deloitte Access Economics, its forecasts include data
drawn from EAs, for example: “Although EBAs
feed into Deloitte Access
Economics’ short-term forecasts for wage gains, there are important
reasons why EBA data is not the
sole driver of utilities wage movements going
forward ...”.
discern in the submissions on behalf of the applicants a tendency to use the
terms “irrelevant considerations”, “relevant
considerations” or “erroneous reasoning” or
“illogicality” loosely, in circumstances which amounted
than disagreement with the AER’s conclusion. We have not dealt separately
with each of those submissions.
applicants submitted that it was error on the part of the AER to rely on a
Deloitte Access Economics’ opinion that the “electricity”
component was a large component of the utilities sector was misplaced as, it was
submitted, the Victorian EGWW WPI was not a good
comparator for CitiPower and
Powercor, primarily because of the specialised skills of their employees. We do
not accept there is
any reviewable error on the part of the AER in this respect.
third claimed error was put not only as a consequence of the first claimed error
but also in the alternative, that alternative
being that the AER does have a
discretion as to whether or not to accept so much of the opex and capex
forecasts as relate to the
EAs labour price growth. The applicants pointed to
the distortion of incentives that would flow if they were not able to capture
their full 2016 EA costs in circumstances where the EAs were efficient when
struck. As the argument was put in oral submissions,
the point was as follows:
the AER said that adopting the wage increase and affirming the EA reduced the
incentive to minimise wage
growth and this was in effect saying that there was
no benefit to negotiating lower wage rate increases because that would have the
effect of reducing the revenue allowance at the next reset. That was only true
if the DNSP assumed that at the next regulatory reset
the AER would not closely
scrutinise the EAs that had then been entered into. It was put in
submission:
So there’s an irrationality in what the AER is
saying. It says that, “We don’t have to accept your EAs at face
We can scrutinise them. But we’re not going to give you your EA
increase on this occasion because you might think that we will
automatically
allow for that in the next regulatory control period.” But there would be
no rational reason for a DNSP to think...
like that if it’s true that
these things are not regulatory obligations and they can be closely scrutinised
by the AER.
was submitted that allowing the applicants the EA wage increases that were
struck in 2014 did not send a message to anyone that
the AER would not
scrutinise future EAs for efficiency.
was also put that the AER’s analysis overlooked the operation of the EBSS
and the CESS because they served to incentivise
the DNSPs to strike efficient
wage outcomes. The applicants submitted that in actual fact the approach that
was adopted by the AER
served as a disincentive to efficiency rather than the
other way round. They submitted that a fair and proper reading of the PwC
of Mr Balchin did not support, as a matter of logic, the conclusions drawn by
our view, no illogicality has been established showing an incorrect exercise of
the AER’s discretion or that the AER’s
decision was unreasonable
within s 71C of the
. The errors alleged go to the merits of the
reasoning: they are matters on which reasonable minds may differ but they remain
judgements reasonably open to be made by the AER. We accept the
submission that there is nothing illogical in judging that the use
appropriate forecast benchmarks will create incentives for service providers to
meet or beat those benchmarks, thereby increasing
efficiency over time
It was open to the AER to consider that a benchmark approach was suitable to
creating appropriate incentives and that it was important
to have a consistent
approach to a benchmark.
fourth claimed error concerned CitiPower and Powercor’s hybrid forecasting
method. The applicants submitted that it was
illogical to throw out the 2016
forecasts merely because the same analysis could not be employed for the whole
period. This was submitted
to be a reasoning and logical error. CitiPower and
Powercor accepted that their approach involved utilising one methodology for
and another for 2017 to 2020 but that was a function of the underlying
facts and information. In our opinion it has not been shown
that there was any
reviewable error, beyond a reasonable difference of opinion, in the AER’s
approach which was that it was
preferable to use one methodology for the
entirety of the period. The AER’s single methodology avoided the need to
adjustment for difficulties arising from using two different
methodologies, one for 2016 and the other for 2017-2020. In our opinion,
contention that a known number should be used, with an adjustment, as opposed to
a single overall methodology is a dispute about
available choices, not rising to
reviewable error.
fifth claimed error was one of internal inconsistency. It was submitted to be
inconsistent on the part of the AER to accept that
CitiPower and Powercor were
among the most efficient DNSPs but not to allow them their (efficient) revealed
cost of labour escalation
under their EAs. We shall assume, with some doubt,
that internal inconsistency may give rise to reviewable error, but we are not
persuaded that there was such an inconsistency. We see no inconsistency between
forming the view that historical opex has been at
efficient levels and forming a
different view about recent wage increases.
sixth and final claimed error was said to be the likely under-compensation of
CitiPower and Powercor by the AER’s use of
the Victorian EGWW WPI. It was
said that the AER based its forecast of labour price growth on estimates of the
Victorian EGWW WPI
which it knew were likely to be biased downwards. This was
submitted to be the making of one or more errors of fact by the AER in
findings of fact. It was elsewhere and earlier said to amount to illogical
reasoning or a failure to take relevant considerations
into account, giving rise
to an incorrect exercise of discretion or an unreasonable decision.
Having considered the applicants’ submissions on this issue, including
their reply submissions at [114]-[119], in our opinion
the complaint does not
rise to the level of reviewable error but rather remains a contention as to the
more appropriate index comparator.
To submit that the Victorian EGWW is a poor
comparator or that another index is an appropriate comparison or appropriate
benchmarking
does not establish the requisite error.
relation to the decision of the Full Court in
Australian Energy Regulator v
Australian Competition Tribunal (No 2)
, it is to be recalled that that
decision concerned an application for judicial review of the decision of the
Tribunal, the Tribunal
being engaged in limited merits review of the AER’s
determinations. It was in that context, the context of judicial review,
Full Court said, at [371], that “it was open to the Tribunal to conclude
that the AER committed material errors of
fact or (our preferred
characterisation) incorrectly exercised its discretion.” We agree with the
submission on behalf of the
AER that the decision of the Full Court does not
directly assist in the determination of the present grounds raised by CitiPower
and Powercor. We would however add that the Full Court indicated, at [370], that
the Tribunal should examine all the facts and circumstances.
This we have
endeavoured to do.
summary, none of the claimed errors on the part of the AER in dealing with
labour price growth rates has been made out.
