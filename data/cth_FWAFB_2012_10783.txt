ADELAIDE, 21 DECEMBER 2012
Appeal against Order
of Deputy President McCarthy at Perth on 14 April 2010 in Matter Number U2010/6815 - extension of time for lodgement of appeal -
reason for the delay - substantial length of the delay - basis for the appeal.
On 9 October 2012 Mr Sims lodged an appeal against an Order
issued by McCarthy DP on 14 April 2010.
In that Order the Deputy President set out the reasons for his decision to refuse to extend the time for the lodgement of an unfair
dismissal application made under the
Workplace Relations Act 1996
(the WR Act). The termination of Mr Sims’ employment took effect on 9 June 2009. Hence, the application was lodged some 177
days outside of the 21 day time limit specified in the WR Act. The Deputy President considered written information provided to him
by the parties. He dismissed the application on the basis that:
Mr Sims had not provided an acceptable reason for the delay,
Mr Sims had not taken any steps to contest the termination of his employment until well after the 21 day time limit,
the respondent would be prejudiced by the delay,
the merits of the application appeared weak and it was unlikely that Fair Work Australia (FWA) had the jurisdiction to deal with
the matter in any event, and
extending the time limit would not be fair when compared to others in like positions.
Shortly after the Deputy President issued his decision Mr Sims foreshadowed an appeal.
The Fair Work Australia (FWA) Registry function provided Mr Sims with advice of how he could lodge an appeal by letter dated 29 April
Mr Sims’ appeal was lodged some 2� years later. While this appeal asserts errors of fact and appears to assert that there is
new evidence which should now be admitted, the appeal documents and subsequently provided materials, essentially seek to revisit
the matters before McCarthy DP.
Mr Sims’ reasons for the extraordinarily long delay in commencing this appeal relate to his ongoing litigation with the respondent,
his allegations that the respondent has not paid monies due to him, has not complied with earlier undertakings, has been poorly managed
and the consequent pressure this has caused him. We note that the undertakings to which Mr Sims refers were allegedly made in the
second half of 2009 and the middle of 2010.
As Mr Sims’ termination of employment occurred on 9 June 2009, the WR Act applies because of the operation of Items 11 and
12 of Schedule 2 of the
Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009
. Pursuant to Item 12 of Schedule 2, Mr Sims’ appeal must be made to Fair Work Australia. The appeal should have been made under
s.120 of the WR Act. Whilst it has been made under s.604 of the FW Act, we have nevertheless considered it to be made under the relevant
legislation.
The Rules of the former Australian Industrial Relations Commission (Rule 13) and of Fair Work Australia (Rule 12) require that an
appeal must be instituted within 21 days after the date of the order or decision being appealed against.
Tokoda v Westpac Banking Corporation
a Full Bench of FWA stated:
“[3] Time limits of the kind in Rule 12 should not simply be extended as a matter of course. There are sound administrative
and industrial reasons for setting a limit to the time for bringing an appeal and it should only be extended where there are good
reasons for doing so. The authorities 1 indicate that the following matters are relevant to the exercise of the Tribunal’s
discretion under Rule 12.3(b):
whether there is a satisfactory reason for the delay;
the length of the delay;
the nature of the grounds of appeal and the likelihood that one or more of those grounds being upheld if time was extended; and
any prejudice to the respondent if time were extended.
[4] In broad terms the issue for the Tribunal is whether, in all the circumstances and having regard to the matters set out above,
the interests of justice favour an extension of the time within which to lodge the appeal.”
A sustainable basis for the 2� year delay in lodging the appeal has not been made out to us by Mr Sims. The appeal appears to reflect
a pattern of extensive litigation in which Mr Sims has engaged for some years and no satisfactory basis for the delay in this jurisdiction
has been established. In this case the delay is extraordinarily long. Mr Sims’ appeal appears to seek to re-agitate matters
addressed by Deputy President McCarthy. We consider that an extension of the time specified in the Rules would most likely prejudice
the respondent in this matter.
No error in DP McCarthy’s decision has been established to us and we do not consider that the appeal has any reasonable prospect
of success.
Accordingly, we are not inclined to extend the time for lodgement of the appeal. The appeal is dismissed on that basis.
