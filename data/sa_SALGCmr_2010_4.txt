The Palace Gallery & Premises in the West End [2010] SALGCmr 4 (24 March 2010)
LIQUOR LICENSING ACT 1997
ORDER OF THE LIQUOR AND
GAMBLING COMMISSIONER
THE PALACE GALLERY
& PREMISES IN THE WEST END
Effective Date:
24 March 2010
REVIEW OF BARRING ORDER
This is an application for review of a barring order made
under section 125B of the Act, against Jack Apostolidis, the grounds of
barring being assault. Pursuant to section 125B(3) of the Act, Mr Apostolidis
has been barred for 3 months from several licensed
premises in the West End
precinct, including The Palace Gallery complex, his place of employment.
The barring was issued in respect of an incident that occurred outside The
Palace Gallery complex in Hindley Street in the early hours
of 23 January 2010,
where allegedly, Mr Apostolidis was observed by police to strike a male person,
then walk back into the complex.
He was subsequently arrested and charged with
assault. That matter will be heard in the Adelaide Magistrate’s Court on
April 2010, the day before the expiry date of the barring. Mr Apostolidis
will contest the charge.
As a result of his arrest, Mr Apostolidis was subject to three bail
conditions, one of which prevented him from entering the area,
broadly described
by me as the West End of the City. That condition was deleted from the bail
agreement as a result of a Bail Review,
on 9 March 2010, and Mr Apostolidis now
seeks the revocation of the police barring to allow him to continue in his
employment.
Mr Antonio Tropeano, representing Mr Apostolidis at today’s hearing,
submitted that the latter is employed at The Palace Gallery
complex as a fire
warden/first aid officer and that his duties include those of Fire Safety
officer under the Occupational Health,
Safety and Welfare Act (Safework SA)
Amendment Act 2005. However I note, and this was not disputed by Mr Tropeano,
that to carry
out those statutory responsibilities, the Fire Safety officer must
hold a current Certificate in Fire Safety. Mr Apostolidis’
Certificate
expired in November 2009 and he has no current Certificate. I note that Mr
Apostolidis is one of two Fire Safety officers,
however, Mr Tropeano has
submitted that Mr Apostolidis’ duties are more broad than those of a Fire
Safety officer, dealing
with safety issues in general at the complex, including
the duties of first aid officer.
Mr Tropeano submits that Mr Apostolidis’ employment was not taken into
consideration when he was barred and that the barring
affects his
employment.
Police, through Sgt Matthew Fullston, submit that Mr Apostolidis has been
lawfully barred and that the lifting of one of his bail
conditions simply allows
him to enter the West End precinct, which does not conflict with his barring
from licensed premises in that
I find that the barring has been properly made. Assault, whether between
patrons or between patrons and staff, cannot be condoned
in or in the vicinity
of licensed premises. Safety and welfare of patrons and staff is paramount and
they must be protected from
unacceptable behaviour, whether by patrons or staff.
While this obligation primarily rests upon a licensee or responsible person,
staff must play their part, and I find it particularly concerning that a person
whose principal role it is to assist an employer
to maintain a safe working
environment, has been charged with assault relating to an incident in proximity
to licensed premises.
If the assault charge is withdrawn or dismissed, I will reconsider the
matter, but in the meantime, I decline to revoke or modify
the barring.
