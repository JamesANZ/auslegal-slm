CASES CITED
Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales
(2006) 226 CLR256,
Timania Pty Ltd v Inghams Enterprises Pty Ltd
McKenzie v Mackay
[2005] QADT 24.
LEGISLATION CITED:
Anti-Discrimination Act 1991
Section 129
Queensland Civil & Administrative Tribunal (Jurisdiction Provisions)
Amendment Act 2009
section 1339
Corrective Services Act
– a prisoner is prosecuting in the Tribunal a complaint of sex
discrimination in the area of state laws and programs.
the course of this complaint X has been the subject of various actions by prison
authorities. Some of these actions for example,
regular searches and seizure of
X’s property are accepted as having occurred; some – for example the
taking and reading
of private legal documents are not admitted.
submits that these acts constitute victimisation contrary to s. 129 of the
Discrimination Act
is sufficient to observe that on the admitted facts one inference that could
(but may not necessarily) be drawn is of unlawful
victimisation.
facts X alleges would also if done with such an intent arguably constitute an
abuse of process: cf
Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South
(2006) 226 CLR256, para 15 or a contempt of the Tribunal.
Pty Ltd v Inghams Enterprises Pty Ltd
[2004] FCA 732.
would allow amendment of the complaint for the reasons I gave in
[2005] QADT 24.
I do not think the Tribunal’s power to allow
amendment is as limited as the other cases upon which the Respondent relies.
None of which are binding upon me. This is of only academic interest.
will be by the time of the hearing in this matter be a much wider power to allow
amendment of complaints: cf s.1339
Queensland Civil & Administrative
Tribunal (Jurisdiction Provisions) Amendment Act
2009 repeals 176-184 and
inserts 178 of the Act which makes plain the extent of the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to amend complaints
even if those amendments concern matters not
included in the complaint. If anything, this case is an illustration of why
amendment should be allowed. There is no proper reason that a person
victimised for making a complaint should not have the complaint
victimisation issue dealt with together at one hearing. There is no real
prospect of this complaint (either as amended or not)
being settled by the
conciliation process adopted by the Commissioner (which in any event could be
the subject of orders in the Tribunal)
nor any real prospect the Commissioner
would not accept the complaint of victimisation at least that which is within
twelve months.
alternative contention as to
Corrective Services Act
also fails. X is not making a complaint to the Anti Discrimination
Commissioner.
would make orders:
amendment of the complaint to include allegations of victimisation; and
disclosure of the CCTV footage sought by the complainant as referred to in the
complainant’s letter addressed to
the respondent dated 2 September 2009.
