FW: Clarke v Deppeler & Deppeler [2013] SARTT 8 (26 March 2013)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON
Hearing 26 March 2013 at Adelaide
DEPPELER & DEPPELER (RP13/0008)
Resident served with a notice of termination due to default under the
agreement. The parties agreed that the resident had remedied
the breach.
Therefore not appropriate for the Tribunal to make an order for vacant
possession (which was the order sought in the
application).
This is the determination of an application lodged with the Tribunal on 8
March 2013 by the park resident seeking a declaration that
the resident is not
in breach of a residential park agreement.
