REASONS FOR DECISION:
Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (the ‘Applicant) is seeking

Respondent was, at the time the expenses were incurred, a senator of the
Australian Parliament representing
the Northern Territory.
days before the matter came on for hearing in the Northern
Territory Civil
and Administrative Tribunal (the ‘Tribunal’), the Tribunal informed
the parties, and in particular the
Applicant, that the question of
the Tribunal was “a relevant court” within the meaning of
section 57(3)(c)(ii)
of the PBRA would be considered at commencement of the
hearing. Such notice was given to allow the parties time to consider the
constitutional
implications of the Applicant’s claim.

(c) a court of a State or Territory that has jurisdiction in relation to the

Territory” within the meaning of the PBRA.

The effect of

Commonwealth can be exercised by a court in a proceeding to which the
Commonwealth is a party.
As already noted,

original jurisdiction in such a matter and, by virtue of

, the original jurisdiction of the High Court is exclusive of the
courts of the states “except as provided in this section”.

matter to which the Commonwealth is a party. The only jurisdiction

Applicant submitted that, because the Tribunal has been invested

submission is evident from the preceding quote from
Commonwealth v

To reiterate the observations of
Kenny J, the “effect of s 39(1) [of the
Judiciary Act 1903

the Commonwealth is a party”. To be competent
to hear the matter, the
Tribunal must be satisfied that it is court of a Territory which can exercise
federal jurisdiction.

Spigelman CJ concluded at

predominantly – be constituted by judges”. This statement appears

judge. The ordinary members of the Tribunal, pursuant to section 16(2) of the

years’ experience as a

or any shorter period specified in the
appointment and is eligible for reappointment”.

Transfer to another
Applicant submitted that, if the Tribunal finds that the matter is not within
its jurisdiction, it should make an order transferring
the proceeding to the
Northern Territory Local Court (‘Local Court’) pursuant to section
99 of the NTCAT Act. That section

that the matter, or any
aspect of it, would be more appropriately dealt with by

first with a transfer to the Local Court, actions for debt in a sum below
$25,000 are dealt with under the
Small Claims Act 2016
The jurisdiction
to hear such claims, as has been discussed above, is vested in the Tribunal, not
the Local Court. Consequently,
with respect to the Local Court the requirement
in section 99A(2)(b) of the NTCAT Act that the “proceeding would be more
appropriately
heard in the recipient
court” is not satisfied.
while the Supreme Court would have jurisdiction to hear the matter, there are
courts within the federal judicial hierarchy
in which this proceeding would be
more appropriately heard. In the circumstances, it is difficult to see how the
President could
be satisfied that the transfer of a debt action in the sum of
