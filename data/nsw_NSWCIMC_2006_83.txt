CHIEF INDUSTRIAL MAGISTRATE’S COURT
New South Wales
Applicant: Virendra
Defendant: Barry Jones T/as Australian Security Concepts
Case Number: 106536/06
Hearing Dates:
Date of Decision: 21
Magistrate:
Legislation:
Industrial Relations Act 1996
Representation:
Applicant in person
Respondent in
The applicant Virendra Singh
claims an order under
Industrial Relations Act 1996
(the Act) that
the respondent Barry Jones t/as Australian Security Concepts is liable to pay
him $8320 for underpayment of wages
under the provisions of the Security
Industry (State) Award (the Award) for the period June 2003 to October 2003. The
applicant elected
to have his claim dealt with under the small claim provisions
provided by
of the Act.
Unable to settle the matter between the parties
I proceeded to hear the matter informally within the spirit of t6he small claims
Both parties appeared in person.
The evidence discloses that for
the relevant period the applicant was employed by A Kayz Trading Australia Pty
Ltd t/as United Field
Security. The principal of the Company was Mr Aamir Nawaz
A Kayz Trading Australia Pty Ltd t/as United Field Security supplied
from time to time on a subcontract basis security guards to Australian
Concepts to fill guard positions at a number of sites where Australian Security
Concepts held the security contracts. The
applicant was one of these security
guards provided, mostly working on Fuji Xerox sites, for which Australian
Security Concepts held
the principal security contract.
Australian Security
Concepts denies that there is any liability to the applicant as he was not then,
and never has been, an employee
of the respondent. The respondent has
endeavoured to assist the applicant in locating Mr Khan, without
Section 127
of the Act relevantly provides:
Liability of principal contractor for remuneration payable to
employees of subcontractor
Application
This section applies where:
(a) A person (
the principal contractor
) has entered into a
contract for the carrying out of work by another person (
subcontractor
(b) Employees of that subcontractor are engaged in carrying out the work
the relevant employees
(c) The work is carried out in connection with a business undertaking of
the principal contractor.
Liability of principal contractor
The principal contractor is liable for the payment of any remuneration of the
relevant employees that has not been paid for work
done in connection with the
contract during any period of the contract unless the principal contractor has a
written statement given
by the subcontractor under this section for that period
of the contract.
Content and form of statement
The written statement is a statement by the subcontractor that all remuneration
payable to relevant employees for work under the
contract done during that
period has been paid. The regulations may make provision for or with respect to
the form of the written
Retention of copies of statements
The subcontractor must keep a copy of any written statement under this section
for at least 6 years after it was given.
Remuneration
For the purposes of this section, remuneration means remuneration or other
amounts payable to relevant employees by legislation,
or under an industrial
instrument, in connection with work done by the employees.
The provisions of this Act relating to the recovery of amounts payable under
industrial instruments apply to the recovery of remuneration
payable by a
principal contractor under this section.
The evidence shows that
Australian Security Concepts obtained all necessary compliance documentation
from A Kayz Trading and received
updated documents from time to time as
required. A Kayz Trading was paid at a rate of $20.50 an hour. All invoices
received from
A Kayz Trading during the relevant period were accompanied by the
required declaration regarding workers wages under
of the Act signed by
Aamir Khan, director of United Field Security. In such circumstances,
operates to protect the respondent from the applicant’s claim.
from a solicitor’s letter from David Weston, dated 3 June 2004 to the
applicant that A Kayz Trading Australia Pty Ltd
is recorded as deregistered and
therefore the company no longer exists. I also note that Aamir Nawaz Khan
appears to have disappeared.
In such circumstances, unfortunately the
applicant’s chances of recovering his outstanding wages appear
Accordingly, the applicant’s Application for the Recovery
of Moneys is dismissed.
