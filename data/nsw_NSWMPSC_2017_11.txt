REASONS FOR DECISION SUMMARY
Dr Philip Anthony Stephens, MED0001076147, MPO193091, who is 57 years old,
was first granted general registration as a medical practitioner
in NSW on 2
March 1983 under the now repealed
Medical Practitioners Act 1938/Medical
Practice Act 1992
, and remained so registered without conditions until 30
June 2010. Subsequently, he was registered under the provisions of the
Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW)
, and remains so
registered without conditions on his practice of medicine.
We noted that Dr Stephens graduated MBBS from the University of Sydney in
1983, and attained Fellowship of the Australian and New
Zealand College of
Anaesthetists in 1992.
Dr Stephens came before this Professional Standards Committee (Committee) as
a result of a Complaint prosecuted by the Health Care
Complaints Commission
(HCCC). The events which gave rise to the Complaint dated 11 May 2017 by the
HCCC that Dr Stephens was guilty
of unsatisfactory professional conduct,
concerned the application of inappropriate force to Patient A’s right knee
when bending
it to position her for the colonoscopy on 1 October 2014, when she
was anaesthetised. The result was that it caused significant soft
tissue damage
to Patient A’s right knee. The Complaint was amended on the first and
second days of hearing, and the relevant
Complaint is now dated 8 November 2017.
Details of it are discussed below.
The HCCC alleged that Dr Stephens is guilty of unsatisfactory professional
conduct as defined in section 139B of the
Health Practitioner Regulation
National Law (NSW)
(National Law), as his conduct in relation to Patient A
demonstrated that the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised,
by him, in the practice medicine was significantly below the standard reasonably
expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level
of training or
experience.
Dr Stephens admitted certain Particulars of the Complaint which will be dealt
with below, and accepted that he was guilty of unsatisfactory
professional
conduct in relation to Particular 2. of Complaint One.
The Committee found Dr Stephens guilty of unsatisfactory professional
conduct. We did not find him guilty of improper or unethical
conduct relating to
the practice or purported practice of medicine.
We directed that a Reprimand be imposed, but made no Conditions on his
practice of medicine. Our reasons follow.
The Chair made a confidentiality order with regard to the identity of Patient
RELEVANT LAW
n matters such as the one before the Committee, the HCCC bears the onus of
establishing that the Practitioner has been guilty of unsatisfactory
professional conduct pursuant to section 139B of the National Law which provides
relevantly:
nsatisfactory professional
conduct of a registered health
practitioner includes:
onduct significantly below reasonable standard
Conduct that demonstrates that the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed,
or care exercised, by the practitioner in the practice
of practitioner’s
profession is significantly below the standard reasonably expected of a
practitioner of an equivalent level
of training or experience.
significantly below
is not defined in the National Law
However in the Second Reading speech when the National Law’s
predecessor, the
Medical Practice Act 1992
(which contained a similar
definition of unsatisfactory professional conduct), was introduced to Parliament
it was stated that:
The first main purpose of the bill is to refocus the Health Care
Complaints Commission (HCCC) on investigating serious complaints
service providers. To achieve this, Commissioner Walker recommended that
unsatisfactory professional conduct be redefined
so that only significant
instances involving lack of skill, judgment, or care will result in an
investigation or disciplinary action.
.... the reference to 'significant' in
that context may refer to a single act or omission that demonstrates a
practitioner's lack
of skill, judgment or care, or it may refer to a pattern of
conduct. In any individual case, that will depend on the seriousness
circumstances of the case.
e note also that as a general principle, the use of the term
significant
may in law be taken to mean not trivial, of importance or substantial,
Re A Medical Practitioner and the
Medical Practice Act
40010/07, 3 September
(unreported).
STANDARD OF PROOF
he onus or burden of proof falls on the HCCC. It is well established, due to
the protective nature of the jurisdiction, and the seriousness
complaints, if established, both for the Practitioner and the public, that the
standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities,
but to the level of
satisfaction described by the High Court in
Briginshaw v Briginshaw
[1938] HCA 34
The Court there stated:
Reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or
established independently of the nature and consequence of the
fact or facts
to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood
of an occurrence of a given description,
or the gravity of the consequences
flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the
answer to the question
whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable
satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters 'reasonable satisfaction' should
not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect
inferences.
he standard by which Dr Stephens must be judged is that of a Medical
Practitioner who graduated in medicine in 1983, and who attained
Fellowship of
the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists in 1992. We noted he has
been practising medicine without any
complaints since he was first
registered.
he issues to be determined by this Committee are:
hether the Committee is comfortably satisfied that any or all of the
Particulars of the Complaint are proven;
f so, whether the Practitioner’s conduct overall amounts to
unsatisfactory professional conduct; and
f such a finding is made, the Committee must decide whether Orders or
Directions made pursuant to
Division 3 Sub-division 3 of the
are appropriate.
t the time when the Complaint arose, Dr Stephens was a VMO in Anaesthetics
engaged by Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD).
On 1 October 2014, he
was engaged in providing anaesthesia in the operating theatre at Bowral &
District Hospital, (the Hospital).
The first patient on the list on that day was
Patient A, a woman in her early 70s, whose Patient Health Questionnaire recorded
she was 4 foot 10.5 inches tall, and weighed 85 kgs. She underwent a
gastroscopy, followed by a colonoscopy.
atient A had undergone a total right knee replacement in 2006. Her records
indicated she had a further procedure on her right knee
a year later, due to
continuing pain. She was left with limited ability to bend her right knee. This
was noted on the Patient Health
Questionnaire.
atient A was not required to give evidence at the Inquiry. However, she had
highlighted the surgery she had undergone on her right
knee in her Patient
Health Questionnaire, which was with the operating theatre records, and
indicated in her complaint that she had
told everyone possible about her knee,
including Dr Stephens, when being prepared for the procedures.
r Stephens, who was working with surgeon, Dr Joon Kim in the operating
theatre, gave evidence that he positioned patients for the
procedures. He
admitted Particular 2. of Complaint One, in that he admitted he applied
inappropriate force to Patient A’s right
knee when bending it to position
her for the colonoscopy, in circumstances where he was aware, or should have
been aware, of Patient
A’ concerns regarding the limitation of movement of
her right knee. He also admitted that an adequate positioning of a patient
colonoscopy can be obtained with a straight knee due to hip flexion. In short,
and as discussed in the paragraphs below, we
were comfortably satisfied that Dr
Stephens was responsible during that repositioning, for severe soft tissue
injury to Patient A’s
right knee. Dr Stephens admitted that, and admitted
that he was accordingly guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct pursuant
to section 138B(1)(a) of the National Law.
e have noted that Dr Stephens did not make any notation regarding anything
unusual which had occurred during the repositioning of
Patient A on 1 October
2014. He also claimed that he did not know anything untoward had occurred until
he was told some days later
by Dr Kim, after Patient A had returned to the
Hospital suffering severe pain in her right knee, and was admitted there.
ven before the Committee, Dr Stephens maintained that he did not know about
the soft tissue injury which Patient A had suffered on
1 October 2014, until he
was later told. There was however evidence he had prescribed Fentanyl and
Endone, appropriate for short
and medium term analgesia. We are mindful from the
evidence that such prescription is not a routine where no pain, or little pain
after a colonoscopy is anticipated. Accordingly we have concluded below that Dr
Stephens’ was not entirely candid with his
articular 4. of Complaint One, dealt with a conversation between Dr Stephens
and RN Muschelknautz. Dr Stephens accepted that he had
conducted a conversation
such conversation, but did not accept the content of Particulars 4.(b) and (c)
of Complaint One.
DISCUSSION OF THE COMPLAINT, AND FINDINGS
The Complaint of the HCCC
he Complaint was amended by the HCCC on 7 December 2017, the first day of the
Inquiry, and further amended on 8 November 2017, the
second day, which was
agreed to by the parties, and accepted by the Committee.
ltimately the Complaint was that the HCCC alleged Dr Stephens is guilty of
unsatisfactory professional conduct under section 139B(1)(a)
and (l) of the
National Law
in that he has engaged in:
onduct that demonstrates the judgment possessed, or care exercised, by the
practitioner in the practice of medicine is significantly
below the standard
reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or
experience; and/or
mproper or unethical conduct relating to the practice or purported practice
of medicine.
he HCCC alleged that each of the Particulars of the Complaint in itself
justifies a finding of unsatisfactory professional conduct.
In the alternative,
when two or more of the Particulars are taken together, a finding of
unsatisfactory professional conduct is justified.
n the Further Amended Complaint dated 8 November 2017, Particular 1. of
Complaint One was withdrawn.
articular 2. of Complaint One, which remained, stated:
During the procedure, the practitioner applied inappropriate force to Patient
A’s right knee when bending it to position her
for the colonoscopy in
circumstances where:
e was aware, or should have been aware, of Patient A’s
concerns regarding the limitation of movement in her right
n adequate positioning of a patient for a colonoscopy can be obtained with a
straight knee due to hip flexion.
he HCCC noted that following the procedure, Patient A experienced severe knee
pain, swelling and bruising around her right knee, and
was diagnosed with severe
soft tissue injury.
n the Further Amended Complaint dated 8 November 2017, Particular 3. of
Complaint One was withdrawn.
n Particular 4. of Complaint One, it was alleged that between approximately 6
October 2014, and 14 October 2014, the practitioner
had the following
conversation with RN Muschelknautz in words to the effect of:
he practitioner said
“what do you remember about the patient with
the knee on Wednesday”
N Muschelknautz said
“I remember you lifting up the leg and saying
‘now she’s under I might as well manipulate her
he practitioner said
“that doesn’t look good for me. We might
as well not remember it”
Consideration of Particular 2. of Complaint One
e deal first with Particular 2. of Complaint One, and have noted above that
Dr Stephens admitted Particular 2. He admitted that during
positioning for
Patient A’s colonoscopy, he applied inappropriate force to Patient
A’s right knee when bending it to
position her for the procedure, in
circumstances where:
e was aware, or should have been aware, of Patient A’s
concerns regarding the limitation of movement in her right
n adequate positioning of a patient for a colonoscopy can be obtained with a
straight knee due to hip flexion.
e noted further, that following the procedure, Patient A had severe knee
pain, swelling and bruising around her right knee and was
diagnosed with severe
soft tissue injury. She returned to the Hospital on 3 October 2014, following
the colonoscopy (which took place
on 1 October 2014), and was admitted for
treatment of her right knee.
r Stephens accepted that admitting Particular 2. constituted unsatisfactory
professional conduct pursuant to section 139B of the National
Law, but he did
not accept that he had engaged in improper or unethical conduct relating to the
practice or purported practice of
medicine in relation to any Particular at all
of the Complaint.
r Stephens expressed sincere remorse and shame for having been the cause of
Patient A’s soft tissue knee injury on 1 October
2014, and apologised to
Patient A when he telephoned her on or about 11 October 2014. He did so after he
had been alerted to her
injury by Dr Kim approximately a week after 1 October
2014, and after he had made inquiries of other persons who were in the operating
theatre at the time of Patient A’s procedure. Dr Stephens had also
examined records such as the operating theatre report. Dr
Stephens told the
Committee that he had a half hour conversation with Patient A, who was angry and
who gave him the history of her
knee surgery.
r Stephens maintained that he had no independent recollection of any unusual
event which may have occurred in the operating theatre
on 1 October 2014, in
particular as it related to Patient A. We noted from the documents before us
that he had also maintained that
position in the Committee of Review hearings
which were his appeal against the termination of his appointment as a VMO of the
& District Hospital.
e noted that one person to whom Dr Stephens had not spoken before telephoning
Patient A, and who was in the operating theatre on 1
October 2014, was RN
Muschelknautz, who was on leave when Dr Stephens tried to contact him after he
was made aware of the injury
to Patient A. The evidence and the substance of
Particular 4, regards a conversation with RN Muschelknautz, and is discussed in
paragraphs below.
e noted the evidence of Dr Joanna Sutherland, the expert witness called by
the HCCC, who is a peer of Dr Stephens, and a senior anaesthetist
involved in
providing advice and time to numerous official bodies. She practices in Coffs
Harbour, and travelled to Sydney to give
evidence at the Inquiry. Dr Sutherland
told the Committee that positioning of a patient is done in various ways, and by
people in those various circumstances. She told us that in the
operating theatres in which she works, she does not position patients.
Sutherland agreed however, that for a person with a knee problem, where bending
of the knee is not possible, hip flexion is an
alternative for positioning for
colonoscopy.
r Sutherland did not think it was appropriate for Dr Stephens to use
to attain an appropriate position colonoscopy; particularly given Patient A
had concerns about her knee, which she had raised with
the anaesthetist and
others. Dr Sutherland stated that she was strongly critical of any anaesthetist
who applied
to position a leg or knee, particularly in the context
of previous knee pathology. She also stated that the application of
in that context was significantly below the standard of care she would
expect from a specialist anaesthetist.
r Sutherland told the Inquiry that pain after a colonoscopy is usually
minimal, but that the prescription of Endone pointed to the
fact Dr Stephens
anticipated that the pain Patient A would suffer was likely to persist after the
recovery period. Dr Sutherland
agreed that if the evidence was that Fentanyl,
(although prescribed), was not administered in the recovery period, then that
demonstrated
that the level of pain anticipated, was not demonstrated. We noted
that although Patient A complained of pain, she was not given
either Fentanyl or
Endone postoperatively during the hospital admission.
r Sutherland explained that Fentanyl was intended for immediate post-
operative pain, whereas Endone was given for moderate to severe
ongoing pain. Dr
Stephens agreed with Dr Sutherland on the operation of those drugs. Dr
Sutherland also agreed in reply to questions
in cross–examination, that IV
pain relief could be given for severe pain if something had
during the procedure. Dr Sutherland opined also, that given the Patient had
indicated adverse reactions to Codeine, the prescription
of Morphine would be
n that regard we noted Patient A’s written statement in which she
stated that following the procedure she was offered Panadol,
which she refused
on the basis that she had Digesic at home. Patient A stated that when she left
the hospital, she could not walk
unaided due to pain, and was assisted by her
husband and a walker.
e are mindful of Mr Magee’s submission in which he referred to
Professor Courtnay’s statement regarding the bending of
Patient A’s
knee. Professor Courtnay had opined that a person bending the knee of a patient
would not become aware of the limits
of the bending until he or she had reached
that point, and the consequent pain threshold.
hen asked whether Professor Courtnay’s opinions regarding the bending
of the knee would alter her opinion, Dr Sutherland stated
that she maintained
her opinion, as stated above, being that she was strongly critical of any
anaesthetist who applied
to position a leg or knee, particularly in
the context of previous knee pathology.
e have noted above that Dr Stephens expressed remorse to Patient A in his
telephone call to her on or around 11 October 2014. He was
similarly remorseful
before the Committee, and accepted he had been inattentive to the Patient Health
Questionnaire which clearly
indicated Patient A’s knee issues. He
indicated that he had since then, and would in future, take far more care to a
patient’s needs when preparing to administer an
anaesthetic.
he Committee was comfortably satisfied and accepted Mr Magee’s
submission that there was little, if any, risk that Dr Stephens
would engage in
the same or similar conduct again. The Committee was mindful also that there had
been no complaints about Dr Stephens
in his 30 or so years of practice,
including in the period since 1 October 2014.
Consideration of Particular 4. of Complaint One
n Particular 4. of Complaint One, it was alleged that between approximately 6
October 2014, and 14 October 2014, the practitioner
had the following
conversation with RN Muschelknautz in words to the effect of:
he practitioner said
“what do you remember about the patient with
the knee on Wednesday”
N Muschelknautz said
“I remember you lifting up the leg and saying
‘now she’s under I might as well manipulate her
he practitioner said
“that doesn’t look good for me. We might
as well not remember it”
e noted that RN Muschelknautz had been summonsed to give evidence at the
Inquiry. The Committee is satisfied that all the appropriate
procedures were
undertaken. However, on the afternoon prior to the first day of the Inquiry, the
parties received a letter from a
General Practitioner on behalf of RN
Muschelknautz, stating that he was unable to attend for medical reasons,
including anxiety.
e noted that RN Muschelknautz’s statements and records of interview in
connection with Patient A’s matter, in particular
in regard to the
Committee of Review, were before us in the HCCC documents. Given the
circumstances, it was however not possible
to test his statements.
r Stephens acknowledged that he had a conversation with RN Muschelknautz on
approximately 14 October 2014 with regard to Patient
A. He accepted
Particular 4.a. of Complaint One, but not Particulars 4.b. or c. which
concerned the content of the conversation with the RN.
r Stephens maintained during his cross-examination, that he had no
independent recollection of the procedure involving Patient A,
conversation with RN Muschelknautz. He told us that Patient A was the first of
four patients having the same procedure on
1 October 2014, and said that he may
have been attending to the next (second) patient at the same time. He also said
that there were
patients on the list the next day. Dr Stephens
emphasised he had been positioning patients for 30 years, and had been involved
thousands of such procedures.
owever, Dr Stephens told us, (and this he appears to have recalled during the
Inquiry), that he asked RN Muschelknautz if anything
unusual had occurred during
Patient A’s procedure. Dr Stephens told us the RN was very vague at first,
but then talked about
how Dr Stephens had positioned the Patient. Dr Stephens
told us that he (Dr Stephens), recalled saying that that information would
be very helpful in light of the investigation by the Hospital, into the Patient
A matter. He emphasised that he had not been
coercive in any way when speaking
to RN Muschelknautz.
hen questioned by a Member of the Committee regarding whether he had not
contemplated a significant injury had occurred to Patient
A during positioning
for colonoscopy by him on 1 October 2014, Dr Stephens affirmed he did not think
Patient A had suffered a significant
injury. We noted that he nevertheless
prescribed Fentanyl and Endone, which are only generally prescribed if pain is
anticipated
post a procedure. We also did not get the sense that Dr Stephens was
entirely candid in answering questions.
r Stephens said that he filled in the incident form after speaking with
Patient A, and based solely on his conversation with her.
His impression was, he
said, that Patient A had problems with the original knee replacement.
r Stephens admitted he may have been less attentive with regard to Patient A
than he could have been. When questioned further by a
Member of the Committee,
he said that he had been careless on that occasion, and even though he has not
changed how he conducts himself,
he was now more careful in regard to history
taking, and more mindful of potential problems in positioning patients.
n coming to a decision with regard to Particular 4. of Complaint One, we are
satisfied that a conversation with RN Muschelknautz occurred.
In the absence of
oral evidence from the RN, and not withstanding Dr Stephens’ replies to
questioning at the Inquiry, we are
not satisfied to the requisite standard of
the content of the conversation.
articulars 4. b. and c. of Complaint One are not proven. Neither do we, in
regard to Particulars 4.b. and c. find Dr Stephens guilty
onduct that demonstrates the judgment possessed, or care exercised, by the
practitioner in the practice of medicine is significantly
reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of
training or experience; and/or
mproper or unethical conduct relating to the practice or purported practice
of medicine.
r Stephens provided a number of references which were before the Committee.
The Committee agreed that Dr Stephens’ standing
and reputation as an
anaesthetist was not in question, and that this did not form any part of the
Complaint. We noted that the referees
had been told about the Complaint of the
e are also mindful that it would be rare for a person coming before any
Tribunal or PSC to provide an unfavorable reference. Accordingly,
although we
have noted them, the references are of limited value to us in our task.
e noted a reference from Dr Nick Hartnell, an orthopaedic surgeon, who has
worked with Dr Stephens both in the public and private
sector, praising Dr
Stephens for his integrity and professionalism.
r Russell Bourne, a Senior Specialist Anaesthetist, VMO at Bowral &
District Hospital, and practicing privately at Southern Highlands
Hospital, Bowral provided a reference. Dr Bourne recognises Dr Stephens as a
respected colleague and friend, and has known
him since 2011. He stated that as
part of the Anaesthetic College requirements for CPD, he has been in a position
to assess Dr Stephens’
practice of anaesthesia. He gave details of the
procedure, and stated that he had done it for three years.
r Michaella Smith, who is a general surgeon and Senior Research Fellow at
Wollongong University, provided a reference, stating that
she had first met Dr
Stephens eight years previously. She stated that Dr Stephens has been her
anaesthetist at Southern Highlands
Private Hospital since June 2015, and praised
his demeanour and attitude to staff and patients.
r Nestor Lalak, a urologist, stated that he had known Dr Stephens for 10
years. He stated that Dr Stephens had been his regular anaesthetist
time. He praised Dr Stephens as an extremely competent anaesthetist who has an
excellent rapport with patients and colleagues.
r Priyan Wikramanayake, a general surgeon provided a reference, stating that
he had worked with Dr Stephens for ten years. He emphasised
how prepared Dr
Stephens was to assist when after hours emergencies arose, and how he was
prepared to assist staff and position patients.
he Committee had before it two folders of documents lodged by the HCCC, and
one folder of documents lodged by Dr Stephens which it
took into evidence.
DETERMINATION AND ORDERS
he Committee, having heard the evidence and submissions, and taking into
account the legislation, and Dr Stephens’ admissions,
was satisfied that
Particular 2. of Complaint One was proven.
he Committee is satisfied the HCCC has established in relation to the
Complaint, that Dr Stephens is guilty of unsatisfactory professional
under section 139B of the National Law in that he has engaged in conduct that
demonstrates the knowledge, skill or judgment
possessed, or care exercised, by
him in the practice of medicine is significantly below the standard reasonably
expected of a practitioner
of an equivalent level of training or experience.
n coming to a decision with regard to Particular 4.a. of Complaint One, we
are satisfied that a conversation with RN Muschelknautz
occurred. In the absence
of oral evidence from the RN, and not withstanding Dr Stephens’ replies to
questioning at the Inquiry,
we are not satisfied to the requisite standard of
the content of the conversation with the RN.
e find that Particulars 4. b. and c. of Complaint One are not proven. Neither
do we, in regard to Particulars b. and c. find Dr Stephens
onduct that demonstrates the judgment possessed, or care exercised, by the
practitioner in the practice of medicine is significantly
below the standard
reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or
experience; and/or
mproper or unethical conduct relating to the practice or purported practice
of medicine.
he Committee takes into account the fact it is well established that the
is protective,
not punitive. Disciplinary proceedings against members of a profession are
intended to maintain proper ethical and
professional standards, primarily for
the protection of the public, but also for the protection of the profession.
Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield (1997) 41 NSWLR 630
he reach of the concept of protection of the public was set out by the NSW
Court of Appeal in
[2014] NSWCA 307
, where the Court made clear
that a broad understanding of protection was appropriate.
e are also mindful that whilst the primary role of the Inquiry is protective,
it also has a role in maintaining public confidence
in the profession, and
maintaining the reputation of the profession. Orders of the Committee may
operate to have a general deterrent
effect for other members of the profession.

detailed mentoring plan, a reprimand, and a training course.
We are mindful that
there was no allegation regarding Dr Stephens’ technical competence in his
work as an anaesthetist. The

under the National Law, and is satisfied that a Reprimand is the appropriate
The Committee rejects the HCCC’s submissions that Dr Stephens
should have a mentor, or take a training course. The Committee
has accordingly
decided not to impose conditions on Dr Stephens practice.

Civil and Administrative Tribunal.
n appeal must be lodged with the Tribunal within 28 days of the date of these
written Reasons for Decision.
