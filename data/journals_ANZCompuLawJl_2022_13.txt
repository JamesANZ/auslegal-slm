THE AUSCL FUTURE LAW NETWORK
CRNOMARKOVIC
The Future Law Network had a very successful 2022. On 11 March we made a
submission to the ALRC in relation to the Legislative Framework
for Corporations
and Financial Regulation focusing on the need to look beyond XML.
On 15 March 2022, the AUSCL Future Law Network hosted, a Global RaC2.0
Plenary together with the Allens hub for Technology, Law and
Innovation. The
purpose of the Plenary was to engage with the Global RaC Community to share
learning and develop actionable recommendations
to assist the community to
“take RaC to the next level” RaC 2.0.
The Plenary was attended by well over 100 participants, across 10+ countries
with keynotes by globally recognised luminaries - Prof
Mireille Hildebrant and
Pia Andrews. Together we explored pressing design challenges in theory and
practice from running RaC projects
(private/public) sectors and technical issues
(platforms, standards and interoperability), through to public law
considerations,
democracy, Rule of Law and the future RaC workforce - distilling
key principles and recommendations. Since the Plenary, a RaC Working
continues to provide a valuable forum for cross-disciplinary professionals to
share insights on current and future RaC directions.
In May, Natalia Crnomarkovic, Future Law Network leader moderated two
sessions at the Legal Innovation and Tech Fest 2022. The first
was on Rules as
Code with guest speakers Síobháine Slevin, trailblazer in
regulation as digital infrastructure and
CEO and founder of Realta Logic, Prof
Andrew Mowbray and Philip Chung from AustLII.
In second session Natalia unpacked Next Generation Contracting aka Smart
Legal Contracts with leaders in the field - Natasha Blycha,
Managing Partner
with Stirling Rose and Tim Bass, CEO Block8.
The Future Law Network also ran our 6th RaC Masterclass exploring the
critical legal coding in the new world of digital legislation
featuring Dr Megan
Ma from Stanford X and Dr Jason Grant Allen, our AUSCL Tasmanian Chapter
A huge heartfelt thank you to our Future Law Steering Committee - Mark
Staples, Síobháine Slevin, Heidi Richards, Tim
De Sousa and Martin
Harford for giving so generously of your time, expertise and energy to make 2022
the success it was.
Future Law Portfolio Leader,
Australasian Society for Computers and Law (AUSCL).
