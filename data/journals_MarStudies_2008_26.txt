3. Chairman’s Report
The Chairman tabled his report:
There have been four main areas of activity since I was invited to join the
Board at its August 2007 meeting, and was then elected
to this position at the
November 2007 AGM. They have been:
a. clarifying and stabilising our financial situation;
b. marketing our publications and expanding our membership;
c. preparation of publications and submissions, and
d. publicising the AAMA.
Financial Position
The previous bi-polar structure of our accounts, with separate KMO and AAMA
sets of books, made it difficult to appreciate the true
financial position. We
should all be grateful to our Treasurer, Ted Lesh, for consolidating the
The true financial position was parlous. Put simply, costs exceeded income.
By shifting to largely electronic distribution, with full cost recovery for
all hardcopy printing and postage, we were then able to
reduce costs
significantly and produce products that are more useful to our members and
subscribers. That strategy appears to be
working and the financial position
appears to have stabilised.
Marketing Publications and Expanding Membership
The Board recognised that the AAMA is a not-for-profit organization, which
needs to be able to demonstrate that costs incurred are
directed to the aims of
the Association. We would rather spend the AAMA’s limited money on
gathering and disseminating maritime
information than on paying overheads like
printing and postage.
Consolidating the accounts also permitted the Board to recognise that
membership of the AAMA should be separated from subscription
to a particular
publication, in this case
Maritime Studies
. Separating subscriptions from
membership also improved transparency for members and subscribers, allowing them
to see what they
were paying for and, over time, may encourage donations.
The Board then took advantage of our emphasis on electronic publication to
make it easier for members and subscribers to disseminate
our material widely.
We took a conscious decision to keep our charges for that as low as possible,
partly to meet our charter and
partly because the more widely our subscribers
can distribute our material, the more difficult it becomes for them ever to
terminating their subscriptions.
Preparation of Publications and Submissions
The Association is indebted to the editors of our two main publications,
Maritime Studies
– Warwick Gullett - and the
Maritime Digest
– Ernie Davitt. Those publications are what the rest of the world normally
sees of the AAMA, and give credibility to any other
utterances or submissions
that the AAMA publishes.
Maritime Digest
has benefited most from the move to electronic
publication because, freed from the space and cost constraints of hardcopy, it
been able to expand to cover more of the vast range of maritime news
information that is so sadly neglected by the Australian media.
In their turn,
subscribers have been able to make good use of its electronic
format, eg the RAN can now distribute the
to all its personnel. On
the other hand, the
Maritime Digest
has a major vulnerability in that it
relies on just two people, Ernie to gather and determine its content, and Jean
to compile and
distribute it.
Maritime Studies
, on the other hand, appears to have a quite different
problem. There seems to be a shortage of academic papers of adequate standard
for peer review and publication. This is something that the Board will need to
keep under review and we need to encourage all AAMA
members to point potential
writers of maritime papers towards Warwick. On the plus side, at least Warwick
now has two Assistant Editors
so he should not feel totally alone when working
Maritime Studies
Our submissions to two major reviews – the Defence White Paper and
Infrastructure Australia’s list of infrastructure priorities
had to rely on drafting resources at hand. The Association needs to develop its
capacities in this regard.
Publicising the AAMA
Publicity is both an aim and a consequence if the AAMA is to achieve its
raison d’être. Like most things in life, there
is no magic bullet;
publicity is all about cheerful hard work and getting all the little steps
right. It’s like “booting”
a computer – a tiny first
step makes possible a slightly more complex next one, and so on.
First we need to establish our credibility, which we do with the AAMA’s
publications and submissions. Then we need to get decision-makers
to take notice
of them (or, at least, we must convince others that the decision-makers take
notice of us). Then we will be invited
to provide comments and submissions. At
that point others will notice that the AAMA is a channel for communicating with
decision-makers
and more information will come our way. Thus our influence
Simply being able to “be there” is a first step – finding
the resources to respond to requests. This year there
have been some requests
for maritime information from small schools. The numbers of students were not
great but if we can build a
reputation in that area – education –
the AAMA will be meeting its charter.
The more we can encourage organizations and individuals to communicate with
the AAMA, the better we will be able to do our job. It
is therefore incumbent on
our members, and particularly our Board members, to share maritime information
to the maximum extent possible.
2007-08 has seen the AAMA make a good start on recovering from the problems
Our next challenge will be to persevere, to seize every possible opportunity
to improve the nation’s understanding of maritime
affairs, without concern
for the magnitude of the challenge and despite our apparently limited
Richard Griffiths
In supporting the Chairman’s remarks Mr Davitt said the Board was most
grateful to the Chairman for his hard work during the
course of the year and for
the very innovative approaches he had proposed to put the Association back into
a sound financial position.
He also pointed out that Mr Griffiths had done a lot
of hard work in preparing the various submissions put forward by AAMA during
year. The Board supported Mr Davitt’s comments.
The Chairman moved that his report be accepted, seconded P.
Rimmer/CARRIED.
4. Treasurer’s & Auditor’s Report
The Profit & Loss Statements and Balance Sheets for the Australian
Association for Maritime Affairs and the Kindred Maritime Organisations
tabled. Also tabled were the Auditor’s reports for the year 1 July 2007 to
30 June 2008 for both the AAMA and the KMO.
From 1 July 2008 the
Association’s bookkeeping has been simplified and the “Consolidated
Balance Sheet”, based
on the end-of-financial-year balance sheets of the
AAMA and KMO, shows the opening balances for this new set of books. This
has been approved and stamped by the Auditor. (All these documents are
attached to these minutes.)
In the absence of the Treasurer, Mr Nelson moved that the financial
statements and the Auditor’s report be adopted/seconded
