subject to Pay-roll Tax, unless a particular
exemption applies. However, even where no
exemption applies and the contract is subject to
tax, the purpose of the section is to tax payments
made in respect of labour only, excluding the costs
of materials and equipment incurred by the
contractor.
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to clarify
those deductions for materials and equipment,
currently available, for particular types of
contractors and to outline the manner in which new
deductions may be granted.
On the basis of submissions made by employers or
representatives, the following percentage
deductions have been allowed for particular types
of contractors, on the basis that they approximate
the amount of each contract representing the cost
of materials and equipment.

regarding the cost of materials and equipment
provided by the contractor, to allow a percentage
deduction to be calculated.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of
law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
