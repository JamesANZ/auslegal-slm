Complainant AV v Body Established for a Public Purpose [2011] VPrivCmr 4 (28 September 2011)
2011 VPrivCmr 4
Complainant AV v Body Established for a Public Purpose
[2011] VPrivCmr
IPP 1 – Collection
– whether the
organisation collected information that was necessary for its functions or
- IPP 8 – Anonymity
– whether the organisation
failed to provide an anonymity option where it was lawful and
practicable.
___________________________________________________________________
The Complainant attended two performances at a
theatre, a body established for a public purpose under statute. On both
the Complainant was asked for his name, address, e-mail address and
telephone number, despite wanting to pay with cash. Staff of
the theatre
informed him that refusal or failure to provide the requested information would
result in him being refused entry to
the venue. The Complainant complained at
the time about the unnecessary collection of his personal information, but the
was not logged by the organisation and was not escalated further. He
was admitted to the venue, however, as he already had an account
under his name
with the theatre.
The Complainant complained to the Privacy Commissioner, arguing that the
theatre had breached IPP 1.1 by collecting personal information
was not necessary for its functions or activities, and had failed to provide him
with the option of transacting anonymously
with the organisation under IPP 8.1.
Organisation’s Response
In response to the complaint, the theatre argued that there was no breach of
the Complainant’s privacy as it had conducted an
investigation into the
complaint and found that staff at the ticket office could not recall the
incident. However, the theatre did
have a transaction record on its systems
under a name similar to the Complainant’s for one of the performances in
The theatre also stated it did not have a chance to respond to the complaint,
as the Complainant had only complained to staff at the
ticket office, and had
not escalated the complaint higher.
The Privacy Commissioner considered that whether information collected was
necessary for a function or activity of an organisation,
and accordingly whether
an option to transact anonymously was practicable, depended on the
circumstances. In this case, there was
a factual disagreement between the
parties whether or not the information had been collected at all. The failure of
a staff member
at the ticket office to escalate a complaint within the
organisation was not a sufficient reason to decline the complaint.
The Privacy Commissioner therefore considered there were insufficient grounds
to exercise her discretion to decline the complaint
under s 29 of the Act, and
referred the matter to conciliation.
The matter was resolved with the organisation agreeing to review its
procedures for collecting personal information.
