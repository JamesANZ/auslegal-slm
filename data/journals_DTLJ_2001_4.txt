Given the lightning pace of change in the telecoms
industry, a
book on the current status of the relevant laws and regulations risks
outdated even before it is in the stores. Spiwak and Naftel have
rightly chosen an entirely different, but interesting
approach. In
'The Telecoms Trade War' they 'cynically' explore the respective
efforts of the
United States and the European
Union to implement the World Trade
Organisation
Basic Agreement on Telecommunications Services and how initiatives to
markets affect markets for international telecoms. Their
exploration
begins by signalling two disturbing trends
telecoms regulation
towards neo-mercantilism
is causing a growing
telecoms trade war; (
regulators loose sight of what
should be the first and most
important goal of regulating telecom markets, i.e. maximising
by promoting effective competition.
To explore and clarify these trends the book is divided
four sections. The first section provides an analytical framework for
understanding the developments in international telecoms regulation in
following sections. Whereas a reader with some knowledge
in the field
the impression that in this part Naftel and Spiwak are merely stating
obvious, this ad fontes is necessary
to understand and critically view
developments described in the next sections.
As the authors amply demonstrate and prove through many
examples in the book, the on-going telecoms trade war turns basic
principles on their collective head. Neo-mercantilism leads to
policies essentially marked by the protection of national
openings imply accessibility from the outside. However, national
today produces barriers to entry; namely,
technical barriers to the
inter-operability of infrastructures by a restrictive interconnection
economic barriers by a dissuasive
system of settlement rates, and legal
barriers by a regulation of investments.
Section II examines US efforts to promote both domestic
international telecoms, before and after the WTO Basic Agreement. In
section Naftel and Spiwak sketch a development in which the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) instead of just promoting effective
competition, gets increasingly engaged in trade politics.
Naftel and Spiwak's analysis of the FCC's approach to the
international telephony market illustrates the fact that the FCC is
increasingly involved in trade politics in a very convincing way. Take
example the FCC's International Carriers Paradigm: while
it focused on
obtaining operating agreements with foreign correspondents, it was not
force open foreign markets for the benefit
of US carriers. The
Effective Competitive Opportunities Order, however, was nothing more

a precondition for foreign entry, meant to
serve trade
interests. This was not the end of it. Even after the WTO Basic
FCC remained distrustful of the good intentions of foreign states. In
Order the FCC maintained that it would not make
the presence of
accounting rates a pre-condition of entry, but would instead permit
entry if it found that US
carriers could avail themselves of effective
competitive opportunities in the foreign destination market; or, in the
opportunities, if it found that countervailing public interest
were present. In its Foreign Participation Order, however,
apply a completely opposite standard for foreign entry into US markets.
decided to simply charge a substantial
entry fee to any WTO Member
country that
wanted to participate in US markets. The size of the fee depended on a
classification system
lacking an analytical foundation, thereby making
regulation highly arbitrary from an economic perspective.
In Section III the European regime is analysed. Because
book is specifically written for American readers, this section begins
general introduction to EU law. Naftel and Spiwak discuss EU
competition law,
including the essential facilities doctrine
in more detail. As we know,
telecommunications competition in the EU happened largely through
application
of EU competition law.
Naftel and Spiwak examine thoroughly the
Commission's efforts to bring down international calling prices through
of international interconnection, the application and
interpretation
of the concept of special and exclusive rights, the EU's
Telecommunications
Access Notice and the on-going efforts to force incumbents to unbundle
loops. Other subjects are the EU's approach to the Information
course, the future of telecommunications regulation as laid down in the
Telecommunications Review. Naftel and
Spiwak are very critical of the
of significant market power, noting that it has no basis in
jurisprudence of
the European
Court of Justice. However, this concept should be seen in
light of markets moving from a monopolistic situation to a more
competitive
situation. In the Telecommunications Review the heaviest regulatory

share of 50 % or
In principle, Naftel and Spiwak see the 1999
Communications

They show that significant entry barriers can emerge when regulators
promote public interests. For example,
universal service obligations in
require, amongst other things, making broadband Internet access
available in
libraries and
schools. The costs of making this service available are
the market parties, thereby significantly deterring new entry for
companies. In contrast, the EU has understood that universal service

only France has an

neo-mercantilistic development in telecoms regulation. Although
overly cynical,

regulators,

the book is to be
recommended to
everyone with an interest in the field.
Neo-mercantilism is a trade policy whereby a
state seeks to maintain a balance of trade surplus and to promote
and employment by reducing imports, stimulating domestic
production,
and promoting exports. Regulation is one of the means to reach
mentioned goals.
