These Class 1 proceedings arise as a result of the deemed refusal, by Blacktown
City Council (the Council), of Development Application
DA-24-00714 which seeks
consent for the demolition of all existing buildings and structures, tree
removal, civil works, and construction
storey seniors housing
development above a basement car park, in the form of an infill self-care
housing development at 99-101 Lock
Street and 53 Pendant Avenue, Blacktown, Lots

proceedings have been brought to the Court pursuant to
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
an earlier unsuccessful conciliation conference, at the parties’ request a
further conciliation conference was arranged
by the Court under
Land and Environment Court Act 1979
(NSW) (LEC Act), which was held on 30
October 2025.
the conciliation conference, the parties reached agreement as to acceptable
terms of a decision in the proceedings. This decision
involved the Court
upholding the appeal and granting development consent to the development
application subject to conditions.
part of this agreement, pursuant to
Environmental Planning and
Assessment Regulation 2021
(NSW) (EPA Regulation), the Council agreed to the
applicant amending the development application to adequately address their
contentions.
s 34(3) of the LEC Act, I must dispose of the proceedings in accordance with the
parties’ decision if that decision is
one that the Court could have made
in the proper exercise of its functions. The parties’ decision involves
the Court exercising
the function under s 4.16 of the EPA Act to grant consent
to the development application. There are jurisdictional prerequisites
be satisfied before this function can be exercised, which the parties identified
and explained. From this I note the following
development application was made with the written consent of the owner of the
application was adequately notified from 27 September to 11 October 2024. Nine
submissions were received in this time. Based on
the amended application, the
parties submit, and I accept, that the development as amended adequately
responds to the concerns raised
in these submissions.
4.6 of the State Environmental Planning Policy (Resilience and Hazards)
2021 requires the consent authority to consider whether
the site is
contaminated, and if so, whether it will be suitable for the intended use. Based
on the parties’ submission and
the information contained in the
Preliminary Site Investigation by NEO Consulting, dated 16 May 2025, I accept
that the land has
historically been used for residential purposes, is
not likely to be contaminated and is suitable for the proposed development.
proposed development, which incorporates 29 independent living units, is defined
as ‘in-fill self-care housing’ pursuant
to the State Environmental
Planning Policy (Housing) 2021 (SEPP Housing), and accordingly Chapter 3 Part 5
of this SEPP applies.
From the information contained in the Statement of
Environmental Effects by CSK Planning & Associates dated 15 August 2024
the amended architectural plans by VOARC dated 23 September 2025, and the
parties’ submission, with reference to the relevant
provisions of the
Housing SEPP I accept the following:
(1) The general development standards at s 84 are met with the proposed
development (SEPP Housing s 84).
(2) The development standards for independent living units set out in Sch 4 of
the SEPP Housing are met (SEPP Housing s 85).
(3) The proposed development is to provide housing for seniors or people who
have a disability and is therefore permissible under
this part (SEPP Housing s
(4) The development will provide adequate access to facilities and services for
residents (SEPP Housing s 93).
(5) The development will be connected to a reticulated water system, and will
have adequate facilities for the removal of sewage
(SEPP Housing s 95).
(6) The design has been considered against the Seniors Housing Design Guide 2023
and is acceptable (Annexure 2 of the SEE) (SEPP
Housing s 97).
(7) Section 108 of the SEPP Housing relevantly provides that the floor space
ratio (FSR) of the development must not exceed 0.5:1.
The proposed development
meets all other relevant standards in this section but exceeds the FSR control
with a proposed FSR of 0.59:1.
A written request to vary this control has been
filed with the application, pursuant to cl 4.6 of the Blacktown Local
Environmental
Plan 2015 (BLEP). This request demonstrates that compliance with
the FSR standard is unreasonable and unnecessary because the proposed
development meets the objectives of the standard, and of the zone. Further, in
demonstrating that the exceedance of FSR will not
result in any unreasonable
amenity impacts, and will result in a building that complies with all
established urban design principles
under the relevant instruments, the
applicant provides sufficient environmental planning grounds to vary the FSR
subject site is zoned R2 Low Density under the BLEP, within which development
for the purposes of a seniors housing is permissible
with consent. The proposed
development is consistent with the objectives of this zone.
is permitted with consent under cl 2.7 of the Blacktown Local Environmental Plan
2015 (BLEP).
cl 4.3 sets a maximum height of 9m to the site, with which this development
application is accompanied by a Flood Study by CK Engineering Services dated
April 2025, which demonstrates that the proposed
development meets the flood
planning requirements of s 5.21 of the BLEP.
SEE confirms that the subject land has been utilised for residential purposes
for many years and is within a suburban locality.
From this, and from the
amended architectural and stormwater drawings, I accept that all the essential
services listed at BLEP cl
7.5 are available, or that adequate arrangements have
been made to make them available when required
these reasons, I am satisfied that the parties’ decision is one that the
Court could have made in the proper exercise of
its functions, as required by s
34(3) of the LEC Act. Subsequently, I am required under s 34(3) of the LEC Act
to dispose of the
proceedings in accordance with the parties’
