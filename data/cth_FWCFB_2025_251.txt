Application to extend the default period for the Melbourne Citymission
Residential/Support Services Agreement 2007 and the Able Australia
The Health Services Union (the Applicant) has applied pursuant to
subitem 20A(4) of Sch 3 to the
Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and
Consequential Amendments) Act 2009
(Cth) (the Transitional Act) to
extend the default period for two agreements, the
Melbourne Citymission
Residential/Support Services Agreement 2007
(AC312394) and the
Australia Collective Agreement
(AC315302) (together, the Agreements).
The applications are supported by the relevant employer, Able
This is the fourth such application in respect of the Agreements. An
initial application filed on 22 September 2023 extended the default
period to 6
December 2024
application extended the default period to 6 June
application further extended the default period to 6 October
This application was filed on 29 September 2025 and seeks a further
extension of the default period to 6 January 2026. The operation
Agreements has, by force of the Transitional Act, been preserved pending the
determination of this application.
Each of the earlier extensions were sought and granted on the basis
that subitem 20A(7) applied where bargaining for a replacement
agreement was
In the period since the last extension, bargaining has continued for
a single enterprise agreement to replace the Agreements. Employees
requested to vote on a proposed agreement between 8 and 16 September 2025. The
ballot did not endorse the proposed agreement.
Since the unsuccessful ballot, bargaining has recommenced.
Consequently subitem 7 continues to apply. We have considered whether it
appropriate to extend the default periods where the bargaining, which now
appears to be protracted, has not resulted in a replacement
agreement. The
parties seek a short extension to 6 January 2026 as they believe an agreement is
imminent. We are persuaded that a
short extension is appropriate in those
circumstances. It is a matter of concern that an agreement has yet to be
reached. Had the
parties not indicated that an agreement is imminent we would be
reluctant to conclude that another extension is appropriate.
As we are satisfied on the basis of the material filed that subitem
20A(7) continues to apply and that it is appropriate to extend
the default
periods we must extend the default periods.
For how long should the default periods be extended?
The length of extension granted is a discretionary matter
Suncoast Scaffold
the Full Bench observed at [18] that
Although the Commission is required to grant an extension to the
default period if the conditions of paragraph (a) or (b) of subitem
satisfied, it has a discretion as to the length of the extension, subject to the
limitation that the extension cannot be
for more than four years. The Commission
is not obliged to grant the period of extension sought in the application: s 599
The parties seek an extension to 6 January 2026 to finalise an
agreement. We are of the view that a slightly longer period is appropriate
the circumstances.
We will instead extend the default period to 6 March 2026. Given the
time of year the additional time will, we consider, give the
parties adequate
time to conclude bargaining and have the replacement agreement approved. Should
an agreement not be concluded in
that timeframe we will be reluctant to extend
the default periods further.
We have, pursuant to subitem 20A(6)(a), decided to extend the
default periods for both Agreements to 6 March 2026. The Agreements
published, in accordance with subitem 20A(10A)(c), on the Fair Work
Commission’s website.
