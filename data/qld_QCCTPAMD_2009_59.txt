REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application referred to the Tribunal by the Chief Executive Office of Fair
Trading under the
Agents and Motor Dealers Act
(“the Act”). It is a claim by Ellen Willis (“the
first applicant”) against the claim fund established under
the Act. The
first applicant alleges that she suffered financial loss because of the conduct
of John Gary Ivanoff.
respondent did not attend the directions hearing or file any material as
ordered. The respondent did not attend the hearing today.
I am satisfied that
he was given notice of the hearing and I intend to proceed in his
first applicant relies on the material contained in the file of the Office of
Fair Trading, which is in evidence before the Tribunal.
That material sets out
the background to the claim.
28 July 2008 the first applicant took her Suzuki Swift registration number 868
LCO (“the vehicle”) to the respondent
at Park N Sell Miami
(“the yard”) for him to sell it on consignment. The first applicant
informed the tribunal at the
directions hearing on 6 November 2009 and again
today that she agreed to pay the respondent a consignment fee of $200.00 for the
sale. On 30 July 2008 the respondent advised the first applicant that the
vehicle was to be purchased, but the purchase was subject
to finance. On 1
August 2008 the respondent told the first applicant there was a problem with the
buyer’s finance, but the
vehicle was not in the yard. On 4 August 2008
the respondent told the first applicant that the vehicle had been sold. The
applicant endeavoured to recover the proceeds of sale from the respondent,
but to no avail. The first applicant subsequently obtained
on 7 May 2009, a
default judgment against the respondent in the Southport Magistrates Court. She
informed the Tribunal both at the
directions hearing and at the hearing today
that the respondent has still not paid to her any money for her vehicle. On 2
2008 she registered a lien on the vehicle.
is evidence in the form of correspondence from Mr Gary Oates, the buyer of the
purchased it from the respondent on 4 August 2008 for the amount of $15,000.00.
In his correspondence Mr Oates says that
amount was paid to the bank account
nominated by the respondent.
Legislation
of the Act states:
470 Restriction on recovery of reward or
expense—no proper authorisation etc
(1) A person may make a claim against the fund if the person suffers
financial loss because of the happening of any of the following
(e) a stealing, misappropriation or misapplication by a relevant person
of property entrusted to the person as agent for someone
else in the person's
capacity as a relevant person.”
is clear from the facts that the first applicant entrusted the vehicle to the
respondent for sale on consignment. The respondent
sold the vehicle shortly
thereafter for $15,000.00 but failed to account to the first applicant for the
amount owed to her.
extract from the Licensing Register which is in the Office of Fair Trading file
shows that the respondent was a licensed motor
dealer principal from 8 February
to 7 November 2007. Although the respondent was not licensed at the time he
took delivery of the
vehicle and sold it, he acted as a licensee. He comes
within the definition of licensee and is a relevant
evidence satisfies me that the respondent, as a relevant person, has stolen,
misappropriated or misapplied property entrusted
to him by the first applicant
and that she has suffered financial loss because of that event.
am satisfied that the first applicant has suffered financial loss in the amount
of $14,800.00 being the sale price of the vehicle
of $15,000.00, less the sum of
$200.00 for the consignment fee she agreed to pay. In addition, I am satisfied
that the first applicant
is entitled to recover as part of the claim, the
reasonable legal fees she expended in trying to recover the amount owed to her
the respondent. According to the Magistrates Court default judgment, the
costs ordered were $1501.70. I consider that amount to
be reasonable and I allow
it as part of the claim. The Magistrates Court default judgment also includes
interest of $543.75. However
the Act does not permit interest to be included as
part of financial
amount that the first applicant is entitled to recover is the amount of
$16,301.70.
first applicant’s claim against the claim fund is allowed in the sum of
$16,301.70.
person who is liable for the first applicant’s financial loss is the
respondent John Gary Ivanoff.
first applicant’s claim against the fund is allowed in the sum of
$16,301.70.
person liable for the first applicant’s financial loss is John Gary
