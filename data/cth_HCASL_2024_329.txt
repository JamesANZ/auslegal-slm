Tracey v The King [2024] HCASL 329 (5 December 2024)
[2024] HCASL
applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
of the Supreme Court of
Queensland (Mullins P, Morrison JA and Callaghan J) made on
20 February 2024 dismissing an appeal against
conviction for murder.
proposed appeal does not have sufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant
of special leave, nor does it raise any point
of general principle. It would
therefore be futile to grant the extension of time.
leave to appeal is refused.
