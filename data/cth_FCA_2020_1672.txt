respondent, Jayco Corporation Pty Ltd (
), is a manufacturer of
caravans, campervans, camper trailers, and other recreational vehicles. I will
refer to all such vehicles
as RVs, which was the term adopted by the parties
during the course of the trial.
Corp manufactured RVs at its factory in Dandenong, Victoria. Jayco Corp then
supplied new, manufactured RVs to Jayco dealers,
which then supplied them to
consumers. The supply of the RVs to consumers was the subject of statutory
guarantees and rights under
the Australian Consumer Law (
), which is
Schedule 2 to the
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth). There are
three Jayco dealers which are relevant to the facts in issue in this proceeding:
Jayco Sydney, Jayco Newcastle, and
Jayco Canberra. Each of those dealers is
operated by a company that is independent of Jayco Corp, and is an independent

connection with dealings by each of them with Jayco Corp in relation to claimed
defects in their RVs. The ACCC’s allegations
of unconscionable conduct
were pleaded and maintained at the hearing by reference to the conduct of Jayco
Corp in relation to the
four Consumers. While there were some common components
of the ACCC’s case in relation to the four Consumers, the ACCC did
allege that Jayco Corp engaged in a system of conduct, or a pattern of
ACL, s 21(4)(b);

conduct of Jayco Corp is alleged to have arisen in connection with claims by the
Consumers that the RVs acquired by them contained
defects such as to entitle
them to a refund of the purchase price, or replacement goods, pursuant to rights
under the ACL. The supply
of the RVs to each of the Consumers was the subject of
a written warranty by Jayco Corp in relation to any defects in the RVs. The
terms of the Jayco warranty are important. The terms were contained in a
handbook that was supplied with each RV. The parties accepted
that the warranty
had contractual force and arose by way of a collateral contract between Jayco
Corp and each of the Consumers, the
consideration for which was the purchase by
the consumer of an RV from a Jayco dealer. As I discuss later, the Jayco
warranty was
also enforceable under statute.
issues in this proceeding concern the interaction between Jayco Corp’s
obligations under the Jayco warranty, and the Consumers’
entitlements under the ACL against the suppliers of the RVs. The ACCC alleges
that in respect of each of the four Consumers,
there were manufacturing defects
in the RV that he or she acquired which were of a character that, under the ACL,
entitled the Consumers
to a refund of the purchase price or a replacement
vehicle from the supplier of the RV, which in each case was a Jayco dealer. The
relevant Jayco dealers are not parties to this proceeding. The ACCC alleges that
Jayco Corp considered the Consumers’ claims
against its obligations under the Jayco warranty rather than with full reference
to the Consumers’
rights under the ACL, and thereby engaged in conduct
that was unconscionable. That conduct is alleged to have
(1) refusing to exercise its discretion under the Jayco
warranty to provide a replacement RV;
(2) pressing the position that the only remedy available to the Consumers was
repair; and
(3) unfairly obstructing the Consumers from obtaining a refund or replacement RV
from the Jayco dealer that sold the RV, to which
they were entitled under the
ACCC alleges that by its conduct, Jayco Corp caused harm to the Consumers in
that they were deprived of the opportunity to obtain
a refund or replacement RV,
and that they suffered distress and frustration as a result of their inability
to use their RVs and in
failing to obtain proper redress.
ACCC also alleges that Jayco Corp made false or misleading representations to
the Consumers as to their entitlement to a remedy,
and as to Jayco Corp’s
own role in relation to the Consumers’ rights or ability to obtain a
replacement RV, or a refund
of the purchase price.
its originating application, the ACCC seeks a range of remedies, including
declarations, the imposition of pecuniary penalties
under s 224 of the ACL,
injunctions, a disclosure order pursuant to s 246 of the ACL, an order
under s 239 of the ACL to redress
loss or damage suffered by the Consumers,
an order under s 246 of the ACL that Jayco Corp establish and maintain a
compliance program,
and finally an order under
Competition
and Consumer Act
that sealed copies of the reasons for judgment and final
orders in this proceeding be retained on the Court file. The ACCC’s
standing to bring the proceeding was not in issue. The ACCC has standing under
s 228 of the ACL to institute a proceeding for the
recovery, on behalf of
the Commonwealth, of a penalty under s 224. It also has standing under
s 232(2) to seek an injunction. And
the court may make orders under
ss 239 and 246 of the ACL on the application of the ACCC.
an interlocutory order in this proceeding made by Murphy J on
26 April 2018, his Honour ordered that the question of liability
this proceeding be heard separately from the question of relief. These reasons
concern questions of liability only.
relation to the ACCC’s case that Jayco Corp had engaged in unconscionable
conduct in contravention of s 21(1) of the ACL,
the ACCC submitted that it
was a necessary part of its case that by reason of manufacturing defects in the
RVs, each of the Consumers
was entitled to reject the goods, and at his or her
election to seek a refund of the purchase price, or a replacement RV. It is
necessary to consider in turn the circumstances of each of the four
Consumers. The primary facts were, to a large degree, not in
contest. The fact
of, or content of some conversations was in issue, and I will identify any such
conflicts, and make findings where
appropriate. Although many of the primary
facts were not in dispute, the conclusions, or the ultimate issues were
fundamentally in
dispute. The main issues to be resolved are as follows
(1) Did the RVs have manufacturing defects that led to a
failure to comply with a statutory guarantee that was to be characterised
“major failure” for the purposes of the ACL?
(2) In consequence, were the Consumers entitled to reject the RVs and obtain a
refund or a replacement RV?
(3) Were the representations alleged by the ACCC made, and if so were they
misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive,
or did they otherwise
constitute false or misleading representations made in contravention of the
(4) Was Jayco Corp’s conduct, in relation to the claims made by the four
Consumers, to be characterised as unconscionable for
the purposes of
s 21(1) of the ACL?
Summary of conclusions
the reasons that follow, I have concluded that –
(1) three of the four RVs in question had manufacturing
defects that resulted in a major failure to comply with a statutory
(2) three of the four Consumers were entitled to reject their RV, and to obtain
a refund or a replacement RV from the supplier, being
the selling dealer;
(3) one representation made by an employee of Jayco Corp to one of the Consumers
was made in contravention of
(1)(m) of the ACL because it was
misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, and was false or
misleading; and
(4) otherwise, Jayco Corp’s conduct in relation to the claims made by the
four Consumers was not to be characterised as unconscionable
for the purposes of
s 21(1) of the ACL.
The Australian Consumer Law (ACL)
full statutory context in which the ACCC alleges that Jayco Corp engaged in
contravening conduct is significant. It is necessary
to have regard to the
legislative context, in broad outline, before referring to the relevant
provisions in more detail.
Broad outline
to 1 January 2011, the
Trade Practices Act 1974
implied into certain consumer contracts for the sale of goods mandatory
terms relating to merchantable quality and fitness for purpose.
Those implied
terms had their genesis in the
Sale of Goods Act 1893
(UK), but in many
respects were developed by the
Trade Practices Act
beyond their
century origins. A claim for breach of those terms was a claim
in contract:
Austral Pacific Group Ltd v Airservices Australia
203 CLR 136
(Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ).
In addition, the
Trade Practices Act
created a direct statutory liability
in a manufacturer to compensate a consumer for loss and damage in respect of
goods supplied
by the manufacturer for the purposes of re-supply, which were
supplied to a consumer and which were not fit for purpose, or not of
merchantable quality:
Trade Practices Act
, s 74A to s 74G (now
repealed); and see,
Merck Sharp & Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd v
[2011] FCAFC 128
196 FCR 145
ACL was introduced as Schedule 2 of the renamed
Competition and Consumer
Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No
(Cth), and commenced on 1 January 2011. The ACL re-enacted
several provisions of the
Trade Practices Act
, and introduced new
provisions, such as those providing for consumer guarantees. The consumer
guarantee provisions of the ACL are
couched in terms that are broadly similar to
Consumer Guarantees Act 1993
(NZ): see the explanatory memorandum to
Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No 2) 2010
(Cth) at [7.9]. In turn, elements of the New Zealand legislation appear to have
been inspired by the
Consumer Products Warranties Act 1978
(Sask), and
Sale of Goods Act 1979
(UK), as then in force.
the ACL, the rights of a consumer against a supplier of goods or services no
longer rest solely upon contract. Rather, the consumer
guarantees under the ACL
and the remedies for breach of those guarantees arise by force of the statute.
The ACL provides for remedies
against the supplier and the manufacturer of goods
where the statutory guarantees are not complied with. Relevant to the present
case are the following guarantees –
(1) a guarantee that the goods will be of acceptable
quality [s 54];
(2) a guarantee that the goods will be fit for purpose [s 55]; and
(3) a guarantee that the manufacturer of the goods will comply with any express
warranty given by the manufacturer [s 59].
a general level, and without being exhaustive, in respect of the consumer
guarantees the ACL provides for the following remedies
against a supplier of
goods, against a manufacturer of goods, and as between a supplier of goods and a
manufacturer.
relation to a supplier –
(1) a supplier of goods is liable to a consumer to
remedy any failure of the goods to comply with the statutory guarantees of
quality and fitness for purpose, and for damages for any foreseeable
loss as a result of the failure [ss 259(2) and (4), 261]; and
(2) where a failure is a “major failure”, or a failure cannot be
remedied, the consumer is entitled as against the supplier
to reject the goods,
and is entitled at the consumer’s election to replacement goods, or to a
refund of the purchase price
[ss 259(3), 263(4)].
relation to a manufacturer –
(1) a manufacturer is liable in damages to an
“affected person” where the goods fail to comply with the statutory
of acceptable quality [s 271(1)];
(2) a manufacturer has no direct liability under the ACL itself to repair or
replace goods that do not comply with the statutory
guarantee of acceptable
quality; and
(3) a manufacturer is liable in damages to an “affected person” for
a failure to comply with the statutory guarantee
that the manufacturer will
comply with any express warranty given by it [s 271(5) and
between a manufacturer of goods and a supplier, a manufacturer is liable to
indemnify a supplier if the supplier is liable to pay
damages to a consumer for
loss or damage and the manufacturer is or would be liable to pay damages to the
consumer for the same loss
or damage, and also if the supplier incurs costs
because of its liability for failure to comply with the statutory guarantee of
quality, or of fitness for certain disclosed purposes, or of
correspondence with certain descriptions [s 274(1) and (2)].
from the consumer guarantees and the remedies flowing from any failure to comply
with those guarantees, the ACL also includes
more general prohibitions on
engaging in proscribed conduct in trade or commerce. Section 18(1) prohibits a
person from engaging
in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or is likely to
mislead or deceive. Section 29(1) prohibits a person from making false
misleading representations about goods or services. Relevant to this proceeding,
sub-section 29(1)(m) prohibits the making of
such representations concerning the
existence, exclusion, or effect of any condition, warranty, guarantee, right or
remedy, including
the statutory consumer guarantees. And section 21(1) prohibits
a person from engaging in conduct in connection with goods or services
in all the circumstances, unconscionable. I will return to consider these more
general prohibitions.
considering the application of those provisions outlined above to the present
proceeding, it is helpful to note that, for the purposes
provisions –
(1) the RVs acquired by the Consumers were goods of a
kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or
consumption;
(2) accordingly, each of the Consumers was a “consumer” within the
meaning of that term in s 3 of the ACL;
(3) in the case of each of the four RVs, a Jayco dealer was the
“supplier” of the goods; and
(4) Jayco Corp was the manufacturer of the goods.
Statutory guarantees
statutory guarantees under Part 3-2, Division 1 of the ACL apply where a person
in trade or commerce supplies particular goods
to a consumer other than by sale
by auction. A
of goods has a meaning that corresponds to the
defined term
, which includes in relation to goods, the supply
(including re-supply) by way of sale, exchange, lease, hire or hire-purchase:
2. A person acquires goods as a consumer if,
goods are of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use
or consumption: s 3(1)(b). It was not in dispute
in this proceeding that each
sale of an RV by the Jayco dealers to the four Consumers was a supply of goods
to that consumer in trade
or commerce.
Acceptable quality
54 of the ACL provides for a guarantee that the goods are of acceptable quality.
The meaning of “acceptable quality”
is given content by
s 54(2), (3), and (6) –
(2) Goods are of
acceptable quality
they are as:
(a) fit for all purposes for which goods of
that kind are commonly supplied; and
(b) acceptable in appearance and finish; and
(c) free from defects; and
(d) safe; and
(e) durable;
as a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the state and condition of the
goods (including any hidden defects of the goods),
would regard as acceptable
having regard to the matters in subsection
(3) The matters for the purposes of subsection (2)
(a) the nature of the goods; and
(b) the price of the goods (if relevant); and
(c) any statements made about the goods on any packaging or label on the goods;
(d) any representation made about the goods by the supplier or manufacturer of
the goods; and
(e) any other relevant circumstances relating to the supply of the
(6) Goods do not fail to be of acceptable quality if:
(a) the consumer to whom they are supplied
causes them to become of unacceptable quality, or fails to take reasonable steps
them from becoming of unacceptable quality; and
(b) they are damaged by abnormal use.
must be cautious about comparing the extent to which the standard of acceptable
quality under the ACL compares to the standard
of merchantable quality under
earlier or cognate legislation. The standards are differently expressed, and
attention must be given
to the text of the ACL having regard to its context and
purpose. References to other legislation, and judicial formulations that
explanatory of other legislation, are liable to mask the nature of that task:
Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority
[2008] HCA 31
235 CLR 286
(Hayne and Heydon JJ);
Ogden Industries Pty Ltd v Lucas
[1970] AC 113
at 127 (PC);
[1968] UKPCHCA 1
(1968) 118 CLR 32
54 provides for a common standard of acceptable quality which goods are required
to reach. It is necessary that goods have
all the qualities referred to in
s 54(2) in order to comply with the statutory standard:
Vautin v By
Winddown Inc (formerly Bertram Yachts) (No 4)
[2018] FCA 426
362 ALR 702
) at [142] and [144] (Derrington J). The standards under
s 54(2) include that goods will be fit for all purposes for which goods of
that kind are commonly supplied. This general standard of fitness for purpose is
not dependent upon the consumer communicating any
intended purpose to the
supplier, or relying upon the supplier’s skill or judgment. And, in
relation to the general standard,
it does not suffice that the goods will be fit
for only some of those purposes.
standard of acceptable quality in s 54(2) has as its reference point a
construct, namely the objective standard of a reasonable
consumer fully
acquainted with the state and condition of the goods, including any hidden
defects of the goods. The reasonable consumer
sits with an array of other
hypothetical persons who have been recruited by the law and by reference to whom
objective standards
are evaluated: see,
Healthcare at Home Ltd v The Common
Services Agency
[2014] UKSC 49
; 4 All ER 210 at
(Lord Reed JSC).
Such a person has been described as an anthropomorphic conception of justice
that is and must be the court itself:
Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham
Urban District Council
[1956] UKHL 3
[1956] AC 696
at 728 (Lord Radcliffe).
hypothetical question whether the reasonable consumer would have regarded the
quality of the goods as acceptable is to be determined
at the time of supply.
However, the reference in s 54(2) to hidden defects has the consequence
that for the purposes of determining
that question, the reasonable consumer may
be acquainted with information known at the time of trial: cf,
Medtel Pty Ltd
[2003] FCAFC 151
130 FCR 182
(Branson J,
Jacobson J agreeing). The standard of acceptable quality prescribed by
s 54(2) is not absolute, or a standard of perfection.
It is tempered by
what a reasonable consumer would regard as acceptable having regard to the
several matters in s 54(3). These matters
render the standard of acceptable
quality elastic, and context specific:
[2009] NZHC 2631
(Miller J). The significance of the components of the
guarantee of acceptable quality will therefore vary with the circumstances
Fitness for purpose
55 of the ACL provides for a guarantee that the goods are reasonably fit for any
disclosed purpose, or for any purpose for
which the supplier represents that
they are reasonably fit. The meaning of “disclosed purpose” is the
subject of s 55(2)
disclosed purpose
is a particular
purpose (whether or not that purpose is a purpose for which the goods are
commonly supplied) for which the goods
are being acquired by the consumer and
(a) the consumer makes known, expressly or
by implication, to:
(i) the supplier;
(ii) a person by whom any prior negotiations or arrangements in relation to the
acquisition of the goods were conducted or made;
(b) the consumer makes known to the
manufacturer of the goods either directly or through the supplier or the person
referred to in
paragraph (a)(ii).
29 There is some conceptual overlap between the statutory guarantees in
s 54(1) and s 55(1) to the extent that any disclosed purposes
represented purposes that engage s 55(1) may also amount to common purposes
for the objective standard of acceptable quality under
s 54(2)(a): see,
Jewson Ltd v Boyhan
[2003] EWCA Civ 1030
[2004] 1 Lloyd’s
Rep 505 at [68], [71] (Clarke LJ), and at [77] (Sedley LJ).
Express warranties
relation to express warranties, s 59(1) of the ACL provides for a statutory
guarantee that the manufacturer of the goods will comply
with any express
warranty given or made by the manufacturer in relation to the goods, and
s 59(2) provides that the supplier of the
goods will comply with any
express warranty given or made by the supplier in relation to the goods. The
term “manufacturer”
is given an extended meaning by s 7 of the
ACL, but that is not in issue in this proceeding because Jayco Corp was the
manufacturer
of the four RVs in the ordinary sense of that term.
102 of the ACL authorises the prescription by regulation of requirements
relating to the form and content of non-statutory
warranties against defects,
and mandates compliance with those requirements. A warranty against defects is
defined by s 102(3) of
the ACL as follows –
warranty against defects
representation communicated to a consumer in connection with the supply of goods
or services, at or about the time of supply,
to the effect that a person will
(unconditionally or on specified conditions):
(a) repair or replace the goods or part of
(b) provide again or rectify the services or part of them; or
(c) wholly or partly recompense the consumer;
if the goods or services or part of them are defective, and includes any
document by which such a representation is
turn, reg 90 of the
Competition and Consumer Regulations 2010
prescribes requirements including that particular text must be included in a
warranty against defects. During the period relevant
to this proceeding,
reg 90 was in the following terms –
90 Requirements for warranties against
(1) For subsection 102(1) of the Australian
Consumer Law, the following requirements are
prescribed:
(a) a warranty against defects
must be in a document that is transparent;
(b) a warranty against defects must concisely
(i) what the person
who gives the warranty must do so that the warranty may be honoured; and
(ii) what the consumer must do to entitle the consumer to claim the
(c) a warranty against defects
must include the text mentioned in subregulation (2);
(h) a warranty against defects must state that the benefits to the consumer
given by the warranty are in addition to other rights
and remedies of the
consumer under a law in relation to the goods or services to which the warranty

Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major
failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or

64 and 64A of the ACL have the effect that the consumer guarantees cannot be
excluded, restricted, or modified by contract,
and in the case of goods of a
kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household use, liability
cannot be limited.
A consumer’s remedies against a supplier
remedies available to a consumer for failure to comply with the statutory
guarantees are provided for by
of the ACL. Under Division 1 of that
Part, a consumer has remedies against the supplier of the goods.
supplier is liable to a consumer to remedy a failure to comply with a guarantee
of acceptable quality or fitness for purpose within
a reasonable time, or for
compensation where the supplier refuses or fails to comply with the requirement
to remedy the failure.
If the failure to comply with the guarantee cannot be
remedied, or is a major failure, the consumer may reject the goods. If the
consumer rejects the goods, the supplier must, in accordance with an election
made by the consumer, refund any money paid by the
consumer for the goods, or
replace the rejected goods with goods of the same type and of similar value, if
such goods are reasonably
available to the supplier. Section 259 of the ACL
259 Action against suppliers of
(1) A consumer may take action under this
section if:
(a) a person (the
) supplies, in trade or commerce, goods to the consumer; and
(b) a guarantee that applies to the supply under Subdivision A of Division 1 of
(other than sections 58 and 59(1)) is not complied
(2) If the failure to comply with the
guarantee can be remedied and is not a major

supplier to remedy the failure within a reasonable time; or
(b) if such a requirement is made of the supplier but the supplier refuses or
fails to comply with the requirement within a reasonable

(i) otherwise have
the failure remedied and, by action against the supplier, recover all reasonable
costs incurred by the consumer
in having the failure so remedied; or

supplier, recover damages for any loss or damage suffered by the consumer
because of the

(5) Subsection (4) does not apply if the failure to comply with the guarantee
occurred only because of a cause independent of human

conditions in s 259(3) that engage the entitlement of a consumer to reject
the goods are a failure to comply with a guarantee
that cannot be remedied, or a
major failure
to comply with a guarantee
In relation to what
constitutes a
major failure
to comply with a guarantee, s 260 of the
ACL provides –
260 When a failure to comply with a guarantee is a
major failure
A failure to comply with a guarantee
referred to in section 259(1)(b) that applies to a supply of goods is a
major failure
(a) the goods would not have been acquired by a reasonable consumer fully
acquainted with the nature and extent of the failure; or
(b) the goods depart in one or more significant
(i) if they were supplied by
description – from that description; or
(ii) if they were supplied by reference to a sample of demonstration model
– from that sample or demonstration model;
(c) the goods are substantially unfit for a
purpose for which goods of the same kind are commonly supplied and they cannot,
and within a reasonable time, be remedied to make them fit for such a
purpose; or
(d) the goods are unfit for a disclosed purpose that was made known
(i) the supplier of the goods;
(ii) a person by whom any prior negotiations or arrangements in relation to the
acquisition of the goods were conducted or made;
and they cannot, easily and within a reasonable time, be remedied to make them
fit for such a purpose; or
(e) the goods are not of acceptable quality
because they are unsafe.
260(a), which is set out above, also recruits the hypothetical reasonable
consumer as a reference point for the objective
standard that is established by
the provision. The statutory construct of the reasonable consumer in this
context no doubt draws
upon principles that were developed around the condition
of merchantable quality implied by sale of goods legislation. In
George Wills
& Co Ltd v Davids Pty Ltd
[1957] HCA 6
, the Court approved a
statement in the 8
edition (1950) of
Benjamin on Sale
goods are said to be of merchantable quality “if they are of such a
quality and in such a condition that a reasonable man,
acting reasonably, would,
after a full examination, accept them under the circumstances of the case in
performance of his offer to
buy them, whether he buys them for his own use or to
sell again”. The focus of the ACL, as reflected in its language, is upon
the expectations and rights of consumers rather than of merchants engaged in
commercial trade: compare the reference to “commercially
as a synonym for “merchantable quality” in
Hardwick Game Farm v
Suffolk Agricultural Poultry Producers Association
[1968] UKHL 3
[1969] 2 AC 31
(Lord Reid), and see the observations of Cooper J in
Rasell v Cavalier
Marketing (Australia) Pty Ltd

text of s 260(a) of the ACL directs attention to the question whether the
have been acquired by the reasonable consumer,
fully acquainted with the nature and extent of the failure, and not to the
question whether an individual consumer acted reasonably in rejecting
the goods. In my view, for the purposes of evaluating whether
a failure is a
major failure for the purposes of s 260(a), a reasonable consumer who
purchases an RV is to be taken to have some
degree of tolerance for certain
the legislation assumes that not every failure to comply with a guarantee will
be a major failure. Section 259(2) of the ACL expressly
contemplates that some
failures to comply with statutory guarantees can be remedied within a reasonable
time. Further, s 260(a) requires
that consideration be given to the nature
and extent of the failure in determining whether the reasonable consumer would
acquired the goods, thereby indicating that the mere existence of any
failure is not sufficient. Section 260(c) contemplates that
goods that are
substantially unfit for a common purpose might easily, and within a reasonable
time, be remedied so as to make them
fit for purpose, in which case there is no
major failure on account of unfitness for a common purpose. Likewise,
s 260(d), which
relates to unfitness for a disclosed purpose, also
contemplates that the goods might be remedied easily, and within a reasonable
time, so as to make them fit for purpose.
the nature of the goods is relevant. RVs, like many substantial consumer items
such as motor vehicles, yachts, and even bicycles,
are manufactured from a range
of component parts, many of which may be capable of easy replacement or repair
in the event of some
fault. Some of the accessories, such as air conditioning
units, televisions, or microwave ovens, may be manufactured by specialist
suppliers of electrical appliances, and installed in the RV by the manufacturer
or the supplier of the RV. Many of the component
parts are designed for
mechanical movement. RVs are intended to be towed. The process of towing will
subject the RVs to stresses
and flex. RVs will necessarily be exposed to
weather. They are designed to be lived in, and otherwise to be used. Lids will
and lowered. Doors will be opened, and shut. Drawers will be pulled
out, and pushed in. RVs will be used by families with children,
who sometimes
lack fine motor skills when handling equipment. Surfaces may become scratched or
chipped though normal use. An appliance
installed in an RV, if found to be
faulty, might be able to be easily repaired or replaced by a specialist
supplier. Fuses may blow.
Sometimes, just as in a household, the cause of an
isolated occurrence of a blown fuse may not be apparent. Screws might have to
tightened. Doors might have to be straightened. These things are inherent in the
nature of the goods. The reasonable consumer
will tolerate some faults or
breakages, and some need for adjustments of this type that are exposed by a
period of initial use. The
reasonable consumer will purchase an RV accepting
that there is a reasonable prospect that some components of the RV may have to
be adjusted, repaired, or replaced within a manufacturer’s warranty
period. Putatively, if a reasonable consumer was fully
acquainted with the
nature and extent of a failure to comply with a statutory guarantee at the time
of purchase, the reasonable consumer
might nonetheless proceed with the purchase
on the basis that the supplier, or the manufacturer, will remedy the failure
reasonable time. On the other hand, it does not follow that merely
because a failure to comply with a statutory guarantee is capable
remedied, that a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the nature and extent
of the failure would acquire the goods.
Whether that is so will depend upon the
circumstances of each case.
the reasonable consumer will accept that the process of production of certain
complex goods, such as RVs, can never be perfect.
As I have mentioned, the Jayco
RVs were subject to a manufacturer’s warranty which had as an assumption
that the RVs might
suffer from some teething problems or defects from time to
time for which the manufacturer would assume responsibility for repair.
Jayco handbook that was supplied with the RVs gave this advice to purchasers in
its introduction –
We recommend that you check your RV carefully as soon
after you take delivery as you can ensuring that all items are working as they
should and reporting any problems to your dealer for early
rectification.
introduction went on to state –
Your first Service (1000kms or 3 months) after an
initial running-in period is an ideal time for any minor adjustments to
to be made and for your Jayco dealer to answer any questions you may
is not to be suggested that the existence of a manufacturer’s warranty
should operate to diminish the expectations of the
reasonable consumer when it
comes to questions of acceptable quality:
Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd
[1987] QB 933
at 945 (Mustill LJ). In particular, generally, a
manufacturer’s warranty should have no bearing on the question whether the
goods comply with the statutory guarantee of acceptable quality. Rather, for the
purposes of s 260(a) of the ACL, and evaluating
whether a reasonable
consumer would have acquired the goods, the existence and terms of the
manufacturer’s warranty are consistent
with the reasonable consumer
accepting that some complex goods might suffer some minor defects, expecting
that they will be repaired
under warranty, or in the exercise of remedies
available under the ACL. As I have said, whether that is so in a particular case
depend upon the nature of the defect, and other circumstances. In those
cases that are not clear-cut, the resolution of the issue
will turn upon
questions of fact, degree, and value judgment.
261 of the ACL provides for the ways in which a supplier may remedy a failure to
comply with a consumer guarantee –
261 How suppliers may remedy a failure to comply with
a guarantee
If, under section 259(2)(a), a consumer
requires a supplier of goods to remedy a failure to comply with a guarantee
referred to in
section 259(1)(b), the supplier may comply with the
requirement:
(a) if the failure relates to title – by curing any defect in title;
(b) if the failure does not relate to title – by repairing the goods;
(c) by replacing the goods with goods of an identical type; or
(d) by refunding:
(i) any money paid by the
consumer for the goods; and
(ii) an amount that is equal to the value of any other consideration provided by
the consumer for the goods.
262 of the ACL qualifies the entitlement of a consumer to reject goods,
including by providing for a
rejection period
262 When consumers are not entitled to reject
(1) A consumer is not entitled, under
section 259, to notify a supplier of goods that the consumer rejects the goods
(a) the rejection period for the
goods has ended; or
(b) the goods have been lost, destroyed or disposed of by the consumer; or
(c) the goods were damaged after being delivered to the consumer for reasons not
related to their state or condition at the time
of supply; or
(d) the goods have been attached to, or incorporated in, any real or personal
property and they cannot be detached or isolated without
rejection period
goods is the period from which the time of the supply of the goods to the
consumer within which it would be reasonable to expect
the relevant failure to
comply with a guarantee referred to in section 259(1)(b) to become apparent
having regard to:
(a) the type of goods; and
(b) the use to which a consumer is likely to put them; and
(c) the length of time for which it is reasonable for them to be used; and
(d) the amount of use to which it is reasonable for them to be put before such a
failure becomes apparent.
set out above in s 262(2), the rejection period is the period from the time
of the supply of the goods to the consumer within which
it would be reasonable
to expect the
relevant failure
to become apparent. This is a reference to
the failure to comply with the statutory guarantee becoming apparent, rather
underlying defect becoming apparent, which may occur at an earlier
point in time. In
Nesbit v Porter
[2000] NZCA 288
; 2 NZLR 465 at
, the New Zealand Court of Appeal explained in relation to the corresponding
New Zealand provision –
In some instances the defect will be of a kind where it
may be obvious that something is wrong with the goods but the supplier or
someone else to whom the consumer turns for help may be in doubt about the exact
nature of the problem and thus about how serious
it is. For example, the
operation of a motor vehicle may be affected by the failure of a small and
comparatively obscure part, say,
a waver spring in an automatic transmission;
until the transmission is dismantled a mechanic cannot be sure what the defect
the cause of malfunction, particularly one which occurs intermittently,
may be hard to detect even upon inspection. It may be necessary
to carry out a
series of tests or even to wait and see what, if anything, develops. Or the
repairer may think the fault has been
identified and that the correct repair or
adjustment has been made but this view may prove to be wrong and the problem may
itself again. ... In all such cases, a reasonable period will not
elapse before the consumer has had the opportunity to become properly
an appropriate decision, whether or not to
reject the goods. It almost goes
without saying that the period will be correspondingly longer where the supplier
has taken steps
which effectively conceal a defect or has withheld relevant
information.
Nesbit v Porter
at [41] went on to refer to the practical
utility to a consumer of the right of rejection as informing what is a
reasonable period
within which to exercise a right to reject
In considering what is a reasonable period in a
particular case it is necessary also to bear in mind the practical utility to a
of the right of rejection given by
Guarantees Act 1993
(NZ)]. Ms Nield submitted persuasively that,
although a right to damages survives the loss of the right to reject, in
pursuing it
the consumer may face substantial litigation costs where the claim
is for a sum exceeding the jurisdiction of the Disputes Tribunal
(now $7500, or
$12,000 by agreement of both parties). Replacement (under s 19(1)(b)) or repair
by or at the cost of the supplier
or rejection of the goods, where that is
available in terms of s 18, are more “user-friendly” solutions
to a consumer’s
problem with goods, although of course it may still prove
to be necessary to litigate in order to recover all or part of the
pause to observe that the practical and useful remedy of the right of rejection
of the goods given by the ACL will in most cases
be exercisable only against the
supplier, and not against a manufacturer if the manufacturer did not supply the
goods to the consumer.
relation to the time within which it would be reasonable to expect the failure
, I respectfully agree with Derrington J in
at [265], where his Honour stated that –
... the section requires a sufficiently high level of
certainty in relation to the knowledge of the relevant failure including its
nature and extent and what it will cost to remediate it. If the level of
knowledge required is as identified above, it follows that
if there exists doubt
repairing it, the failure of the
statutory guarantee has not become
263 of the ACL provides for the consequences of the rejection of goods by a
consumer, which include the capacity for the consumer
to elect whether the
supplier should replace the goods, or refund the purchase price –
Consequences
of rejecting goods
(1) This section applies if, under section
259, a consumer notifies a supplier of goods that the consumer rejects the
(2) The consumer must return the goods to the supplier
(a) the goods have already been
returned to, or retrieved by, the supplier; or
(b) the goods cannot be returned, removed or transported without significant
cost to the consumer because
(i) the nature of
the failure to comply with the guarantee to which the rejection relates; or
(ii) the size or height, or method of attachment, of the
(3) If subsection (2)(b) applies, the
supplier must, within reasonable time, collect the goods at the supplier’s
(4) The supplier must, in accordance with an election made by the
(a) refund:
(i) any money paid
by the consumer for the goods; and
(ii) an amount that is equal to the value of any other consideration provided by
the consumer for the goods;
(b) replace the rejected goods
with goods of the same type, and of similar value, if such goods are reasonably
available to the supplier.
(5) The supplier cannot satisfy subsection
(4)(a) by permitting the consumer to acquire goods from the supplier.
(6) If the property in the rejected goods had passed to the consumer before the
rejection was notified, the property in those goods
revests in the supplier on
the notification of the rejection.
51 Upon an election by a consumer to receive a refund of the money paid for
the goods, the supplier must provide a refund in accordance
with the terms of
s 263(4)(a) of the ACL:
at [286]. The imperative terms of the
statutory obligation under s 263(4)(a) do not authorise any abatement or
adjustment of the amount
paid on account of depreciation, or any use of the
goods by the consumer: cf,
Consumer Rights Act 2015
(UK), s 24(8),
which, subject to qualifications, authorises a reduction of a refund to a
consumer who rejects goods to take account
of the use of the goods by the
rejecting the goods, in addition to the right to elect to receive replacement
goods, or a refund of the monies paid, a consumer
is also entitled by action
against the supplier to recover damages for any reasonably foreseeable loss or
damage suffered by the
consumer: s 259(4).
A consumer’s remedies against a
manufacturer
2 of Part 5-4 of the ACL provides for a consumer to take action for damages
against a manufacturer of goods in relation to
a failure to comply with certain
statutory guarantees. Under s 271 of the ACL, an
affected person
a direct cause of action against the manufacturer, relevantly in respect of a
failure to comply with the statutory guarantee
under s 54 as to acceptable
quality, and under s 59 in relation to a failure to comply with a
manufacturer’s warranty. The
affected person
is defined by
s 2 as meaning –
(a) a consumer who acquires the goods; or
(b) a person who acquires the goods from the consumer (other than for the
purpose of re-supply); or
(c) a person who derives title to the goods through or under the
relation to a manufacturer’s liability for non-compliance with the
statutory guarantee under s 54 of the ACL, s 271(1) and
271 Action for damages against manufacturers of
(a) the guarantee under section
54 applies to a supply of goods to a consumer; and
(b) the guarantee is not complied with;
an affected person in relation to the goods may, by action against the
manufacturer of the goods, recover damages from the
manufacturer.
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the
guarantee under section 54 is not complied with only because
(a) an act, default or omission
of, or any representation made by, any person other than the manufacturer or an
employee or agent
of the manufacturer; or
(b) a cause independent of human control that occurred after the goods left the
control of the manufacturer; or
(c) the fact that the price charged by the supplier was higher than the
manufacturer’s recommended retail price, or the average
retail price, for
relation to the statutory guarantee under s 59 of compliance with a
manufacturer’s express warranty, s 271(5) and (6) provide
consumer may recover damages from the manufacturer if there is non-compliance
with the guarantee –
(a) the guarantee under section 58 or 59(1)
applies to a supply of goods to a consumer; and
(b) the guarantee is not complied with;
an affected person in relation to the goods may, by action against the
manufacturer of the goods, recover damages from the
manufacturer.
(6) If an affected person in relation to goods has, in
accordance with an express warranty given or made by the manufacturer of the
goods, required the manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply with a guarantee
referred to in subsection (1), (3) or (5):
(a) by repairing the goods; or
(b) by replacing the goods with goods of an identical type;
then, despite that subsection, the affected person is not entitled to commence
an action under that subsection to recover damages
of a kind referred to in
section 272(1)(a) unless the manufacturer has refused or failed to remedy the
failure, or has failed to
remedy the failure within a reasonable
A supplier’s remedies against a
manufacturer
part of the scheme, the ACL also provides that a manufacturer of goods is liable
to indemnify a supplier of goods for damages payable
to a consumer, or for costs
incurred as a result of a failure to comply with statutory guarantees,
relevantly including the guarantees
relating to acceptable quality and fitness
for a purpose that the consumer made known to the manufacturer. Section 274 of
274 Indemnification of suppliers by
manufacturers
(1) A manufacturer of goods is liable to
indemnify a person (the supplier) who supplies the goods to a consumer
(a) the supplier is liable to
pay damages under section 259(4) to the consumer for loss or damage suffered by
the consumer; and
(b) the manufacturer is or would be liable under section 271 to pay damages to
the consumer for the same loss or
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), a
manufacturer of goods is liable to indemnify a person (the supplier) who
supplies the goods
to a consumer if:
(a) the supplier incurs costs
because the supplier is liable under this Part for a failure to comply with a
guarantee that applies
to the supply under Subdivision A of Division 1 of Part
(b) the failure is:
(i) a failure to
comply with the guarantee under section 54; or
(ii) a failure to comply with the guarantee under section 55 in relation to a
disclosed purpose that the consumer made known to the
manufacturer either
directly or through the supplier or the person referred to in section
55(2)(a)(ii); or
(iii) a failure to comply with the guarantee under section 56 in relation to a
description that was applied to the goods by or on
behalf of the manufacturer of
the goods, or with the express or implied consent of the
manufacturer.
(3) The supplier may, with respect to the
manufacturer’s liability to indemnify the supplier, commence an action
against the
manufacturer in a court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or
equitable relief as the supplier could have obtained if that
liability had
arisen under a contract of indemnity made between them.
Liability may not be excluded by contract
general position under s 276 of the ACL is that the liability of a supplier
or a manufacturer in respect of non-compliance with
the statutory guarantees,
may not be excluded, restricted, or modified by contract. However, s 276A
provides that in relation to
goods that are not of a kind ordinarily acquired
for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, the manufacturer may
its liability to a supplier, but not if the supplier establishes that it
is not fair and reasonable for the manufacturer to do so.
That exception has no
bearing on the issues in this proceeding, because the RVs were goods of a kind
ordinarily acquired for personal,
domestic or household use or
consumption.
Unconscionable conduct
all the specific provisions in the ACL which regulate transactions for the
supply of goods and services to consumers are
the provisions relating to general
protections in Chapter 2 of the ACL. Section 21 prescribes a general norm
of conduct in connection
with the supply or possible supply of goods or
services. Sections 21 and 22 of the ACL in their form relevant to this
were inserted by the
Competition and Consumer Legislation
Amendment Act 2011
(Cth), and commenced on 1 January 2012. During the period
relevant to this proceeding, s 21 of the ACL proscribed conduct that is
unconscionable in the following terms –
21 Unconscionable conduct in connection with goods or
(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce,

unconscionable.
(2) This section does not apply to conduct
that is engaged in only because the person engaging in the

(ii) refers to arbitration a dispute or claim in relation to the supply or
possible supply, or in relation to the acquisition or

(3) For the purpose of determining whether a
person has contravened subsection (1):
(a) the court must not have
regard to any circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of
the alleged contravention;
(b) the court may have regard to conduct engaged in, or circumstances existing,
before the commencement of this
(4) It is the intention of the Parliament
(a) this section is not limited
by the unwritten law relating to unconscionable conduct; and
(b) this section is capable of applying to a system of conduct or pattern of

identified as having been
disadvantaged by the conduct or behaviour; and
(c) in considering whether conduct to which a contract relates is
unconscionable, a court’s consideration of the contract may

have acquired identical or equivalent goods or services
from a person other than
the supplier; and
(f) the extent to which the supplier’s conduct towards the customer was
consistent with the supplier’s conduct in similar
transactions between the
supplier and other like customers; and
(g) the requirements of any applicable industry code; and

that code; and
(i) the extent to which the supplier unreasonably failed to disclose to the

(ii) any risks to the customer arising from the supplier’s intended
conduct (being risks that the supplier should have foreseen
would not be
apparent to the customer);

of the ACL.
will be necessary to return to these provisions when addressing the ACCC’s
claims that Jayco Corp engaged in conduct that
was, in all the circumstances,
unconscionable.
Misleading or deceptive conduct
within the general protections provisions in Chapter 2 of the ACL, s 18(1)
contains a prohibition on misleading or deceptive
conduct in trade or commerce,
and provides –
18 Misleading or deceptive

conduct of Jayco Corp that the ACCC alleges was misleading
or deceptive, or
likely to mislead or deceive.
False or misleading statements in connection with the supply
addition to the general protections provisions in Chapter 2 of the ACL, Chapter
3 includes specific protections. In particular,
Division 1 of Chapter 3 includes
protections in relation to false or misleading representations. That regime
operates concurrently
with the general prohibition on misleading or deceptive
conduct in s 18(1) of the ACL: see, s 18(2).

The Jayco warranty and owner’s handbook
I have observed, Jayco Corp manufactured RVs at its factory in Dandenong,
Victoria, and then supplied new, manufactured RVs to
Jayco dealers, which then
supplied them to consumers. Jayco Corp’s manufacturing operations at its
Dandenong factory were significant.
The factory employed skilled technicians who
worked in a large and sophisticated workshop, using technically specified
During the mid-2010s, which was around the relevant period for the
purpose of this proceeding, Jayco Corp manufactured approximately
10,000 RVs per year. Those RVs were of various types, including campers, vans,
and motorhomes. The RVs were all hand-assembled
by a team of Jayco Corp
employees on the production line. Many of the RVs were custom built to meet a
wide range of customer specifications
including sleeping configuration, floor
plan layouts, décor choices, and a large number of additional features
such as solar
panels, external showers, cameras, and drive assist products. It
would typically take Jayco Corp approximately six weeks to build
that Jayco Corp’s RVs were hand-assembled and made up of a varied range of
component parts, it was not unusual for minor
faults to be identified in an RV
shortly after production. These minor faults were typically identified by the
Jayco dealer shortly
after receipt of the RV, or by the purchasing consumer
shortly after taking delivery of it. After leaving the Dandenong factory
line, RVs were put on a truck and delivered to the buying
dealer’s dealership. That trip would shake the RV, which may highlight
items that required adjustment by the dealer when conducting a cosmetic and
mechanical check of the RV. Further, once the customer
took delivery of the RV,
it was recommended that the customer take it on a relatively short “shake
down” trip of about
1,000 km. The shake down trip is well known in the RV
industry as the RV’s maiden voyage. The purpose of a shake down trip
for the consumer to work out how to use the RV and to identify any shortcomings
that were not apparent during production. Jayco
Corp recommended that consumers
keep a list of any items of concern to be raised at their RV’s first
service, which would take
place after the shake down trip. The first service of
an RV after an initial running in period was referred to in the owner’s
handbook, to which I shall return at [
] below, and the recommendation for a
shake down trip was made in the context that the supply of the RV was
accompanied by the Jayco
warranty, to which I have referred.
has been mentioned, the terms of the Jayco warranty were set out in the
owner’s handbook for the Jayco RVs. The material
terms of the Jayco
warranty commenced as follows –
Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian
Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund

of sections
concerning different parts and characteristics of the RV. Relevant to the
present case is a section concerning canvas
which was in the following
It is advisable when taking delivery of a new canvas annex, or a Camper Trailer
or an Expanda equipped with canvas coverings that
this canvas should be soaked
with water twice and both times be allowed to dry before using the camper
trailer or annexe on an extended
trip. The reason for soaking the canvas twice
is to allow the stitching to expand into the holes caused by the needle
stitching of
the canvas, and it will therefore tend to make your annexe or
canvas cover of your camper trailer more waterproof.

Australian Securities and Investments
Commission v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd
[2019] FCA 1284
139 ACSR 52 (Allsop
The concise statement of the ACCC
ACCC alleged that each of the four Consumers purchased a new RV from a Jayco
dealer which had serious manufacturing defects which
were apparent at the time
of purchase, or soon thereafter. The manufacturing defects that are alleged were
detailed in schedules
to the concise statement. In respect of each of the four
Consumers, the ACCC alleged that a request was made for a refund or replacement,
which was denied. I shall refer to the claimed defects in more detail when
considering the evidence relating to each Consumer. For
present purposes, the
essential details of the supplies of the RVs are as
Consumer MO
(a) Model: Jayco Swan Outback camper
(b) Date of delivery: August 2013;
(c) Price: $27,990;
(d) Supplier: Jayco Sydney;
Consumer TB

Consumer RH
(a) Model: Jayco Journey Outback pop
(b) Date of delivery: 4 December 2014;
(c) Price: $47,000;
(d) Supplier: Jayco Newcastle.
ACCC alleged that the manufacturing defects in each of the four RVs were
sufficiently serious as to entitle the Consumers to a
refund or replacement RV,
which each of them requested on several occasions. The unconscionable conduct of
Jayco Corp is alleged
to have arisen in connection with its consideration of the
Consumers’ claims.
ACCC also alleged a total of seven representations by Jayco Corp to the
Consumers in the course of their dealings with respect
to the claimed defects in
the RVs that were alleged to amount to contraventions of
the ACL. It will be necessary to return to the representations that were alleged
by the ACCC during the course of considering
those claims.
The concise statement of Jayco Corp
its concise statement, Jayco Corp claimed that it did not sell RVs to consumers,
but rather that the RVs were sold to the Consumers
by Jayco dealers, who were
not agents of Jayco Corp. Jayco Corp admitted that the Jayco warranty gave rise
to a contractual relationship
between it and the Consumers, and that it supplied
services to the Consumers under the warranties.
Corp alleged that RVs were complex products, comprised of many moving parts, and
were subject to stresses from transit, use,
and exposure to weather, and that it
was reasonable to expect that issues would arise in relation to the RVs. Jayco
admitted that
the RVs purchased by the Consumers had defects, but denied that
any failure to comply with a consumer guarantee amounted to a major
failure, and
alleged that each RV was reasonably repairable. Jayco Corp addressed the
circumstances and content of the claims of
each of the four Consumers in support
of its denial that there was any major failure for the purposes of the ACL.
relation to the terms of the Jayco warranty, Jayco Corp relied on several
provisions, including those that referred to the guarantees
under the ACL, and
the entitlement of a consumer to a replacement or refund for a major failure.
Jayco Corp denied that an ordinary
consumer would be unlikely to understand the
distinction between the consumer guarantees under the ACL, and the Jayco
warranty. Jayco
Corp denied that it exercised effective control over the
relevant Jayco dealers’ compliance with their statutory guarantees,
denied that it obstructed or interfered with the Jayco dealers meeting their
obligations under the ACL. Jayco Corp also denied
that it had any liability to
the Consumers under the ACL to provide refunds, or replacement RVs.
to the statements that Jayco Corp employees made to the Consumers that were
relied on by the ACCC as misrepresentations, Jayco
Corp alleged that any such
statements were consistent with Jayco Corp’s obligations under the Jayco
warranty and the ACL.
Disputes as to the scope of the ACCC’s pleaded
the course of the opening of the ACCC’s case, a dispute was foreshadowed
by Jayco Corp in relation to the scope of the
ACCC’s case. At that point,
I indicated to the parties that unless they informed me otherwise, I would
assume that the case
was being run by reference to the parties’ concise
statements so that the allegations of unconscionability made by the ACCC
involved allegations of unconscionable conduct towards the four Consumers,
rather than more generally, such as involving a system
or a pattern. I also
indicated that I regarded the ACCC’s concise statement as a document
calculated to give Jayco Corp fair
notice of the case against it, so that if
there were significant allegations to be made by the ACCC that were more than
mere context,
they would have to be expressly pleaded. I indicated that I
regarded the principal elements of the ACCC’s case as those set
paragraph [30] of its concise statement, to which I refer at [
] below. The parties did not take
issue with these observations, and the hearing of the proceeding continued to
final addresses.
final addresses, a number of disputes crystallised between the parties as to
whether the ACCC’s case as presented in its
closing submissions included
elements that had not been pleaded. I heard some oral argument on the topic, and
the parties were given
leave to file written submissions about these matters.
Jayco Corp presented written submissions that raised a plethora of issues,
including some quite minor issues, that it claimed fell outside the scope of the
ACCC’s concise statement. It is unnecessary
to resolve all of the disputes
However, at this
point it is only necessary to mention one.
its written opening submissions, the ACCC submitted that Jayco Corp’s
conduct in refusing the Consumers’ requests for
refunds or replacement RVs
arose in the context of the statutory right of a consumer to reject goods in the
event of a “major
failure”, citing s 259(3) of the ACL. The
ACCC also submitted that Jayco Corp had prevented consumers from exercising
under the ACL, including where defects were not, or could not be remedied
within a reasonable time. The ACCC referred to what it
alleged were unsuccessful
attempts at repair in the case of each of the four Consumers, and referred to
s 259(2) of the ACL, relating
to the refusal or failure within a reasonable
time to comply with a requirement to remedy a failure to comply with a statutory
In his oral opening of the case, senior counsel for the ACCC took the
Court specifically to s 259(2) of the ACL, and read it to the
Court. It is
necessary to emphasise here that, as I have recorded at [
] above, senior counsel for Jayco Corp
foreshadowed an objection during the course of the opening of counsel for the
ACCC, following
which I stated that I assumed that the case would be conducted
by reference to the parties’ concise statements.
its written closing submissions, the ACCC relied on s 259(2) of the ACL as
a ground on which the Consumers were entitled to reject
the RVs, submitting that
that the Consumers had required the relevant supplier to remedy a failure to
comply with a statutory guarantee,
but that the supplier had refused or failed
within a reasonable time to do so.
response, in final address, senior counsel for Jayco Corp submitted that the
ACCC’s case had been confined to reliance on
the existence of major
failures, as defined by s 260 of the ACL, and foreshadowed other
submissions about the scope of the ACCC’s
pleaded case, which led me to
make the direction for further written submissions. Jayco Corp submitted that
“prior to the making
of its closing submissions, s 259(2) of the ACL
had not formed any part of the ACCC’s case”. Jayco Corp relied on
[29] of the ACCC’s concise statement, which alleged facts that
were apt to engage the definition of “major failure”
of the ACL, and not the facts that would be necessary to engage s 259(2), in
support of its submission that the ACCC’s
case had been so confined.
Paragraph [29] was in the following terms –
a supplier of the RV, a Jayco dealer is bound by the ACL consumer guarantees
relating to the supply of goods. The RVs supplied
to the Consumers failed to
comply with the ACL in a manner that constituted a major failure
29.1 no reasonable consumer would purchase
an RV with a roof that did not work, or leaked, or both;
29.2 for MO and JT, their RVs departed in significant respects from the
demonstration models they had viewed;
29.3 the RVs were unfit for the purpose of outdoor use because the roof did not
work, or leaked, or both and were not repaired within
a reasonable
pause to observe that the allegation in paragraph [29.1] corresponds to the
condition in s 260(a), paragraph [29.2] corresponds
to s 260(b), and
paragraph [29.3] corresponds to s 260(c). Paragraph [29] laid the
foundation and context for the identification
in paragraph [30] of the
circumstances in which the conduct of Jayco Corp was alleged to be
unconscionable.
ACCC submitted that its pleaded case had embraced reliance on s 259(2) of the
ACL. Senior counsel for the ACCC fairly accepted
that paragraph [29] of the
ACCC’s concise statement alleged a major failure, and created a tension
that tended to support Jayco
Corp’s submission. However, the ACCC pointed
to other features of the concise statement as raising reliance on s 259(2).
evaluating the parties’ submissions, in addition to paragraph [29], I
have given consideration to the following features of
the ACCC’s concise
statement –
(1) paragraphs [6] and [8], where the ACCC alleged that
the Jayco dealers made lengthy, repeated and unsuccessful attempts to repair
(2) paragraph [12], where the ACCC alleged that
Consumer MO
RV was not repaired within a reasonable time;
(3) paragraph [17], where the ACCC alleged that the defects in
Consumer TB
’s RV were not repaired within a reasonable
(4) paragraph [21], where the ACCC alleged that the leaking in
Consumer JT
’s RV was not repaired within a reasonable
(5) paragraph [25], where the ACCC alleged that the roof to
Consumer RH’s
RV was not repaired within a reasonable
(6) paragraph [30.5], where the ACCC alleged that Jayco Corp knew that despite
many repair attempts, the defects had not been fixed;
(7) paragraph [30.6], where the ACCC alleged that –
the Consumers were entitled to the remedy of a refund or replacement in
accordance with the consumer guarantee provisions of the
ACL because the defects
could not be repaired or was a major failure;
(8) the tables in the four schedules to the concise statement, where the details
of unsuccessful attempts at repair are alleged.
context in which the failure to repair within a reasonable time was alleged by
the ACCC is important. In relation to each of the
four RVs, the ACCC alleged in
paragraphs [12], [17], [21], and [25] of its concise statement that it was
substantially unfit for
was not repaired within a reasonable
time. These two conditions are reflected in s 260(c) of the ACL, and if
engaged, give rise to
a “major failure”. Therefore, the substance of
the ACCC’s case up to and including paragraph [29] of its concise
statement is concerned with a “major failure”, as defined by
leaves for consideration paragraph [30] itself. Paragraph [30.5] is neutral on
the question whether the ACCC’s case extended
beyond reliance on
s 260 as grounds to reject the goods. As to paragraph [30.6], I do not
regard it as sufficient to give Jayco Corp
fair notice that s 259(2) was
relied on. No reference is made to s 259(2). If there were formal
pleadings, r 16.02(1)(e) of the
Federal Court Rules 2011
(Cth) would
require that the pleading state the provisions of any statute relied on.
Although a concise statement may be a better
form in which parties might state
their cases in some types of litigation, its purpose remains to give the
opposing party fair notice
of the case to be met. The structure of the
ACCC’s concise statement, the allegations of failure to repair in the
substantial unfitness for purpose, the clear endeavour to engage
s 260 in paragraph [29], and the absence of any reference to s 259(2),
lead me to conclude that, reading the concise statement as a whole, reliance on
s 259(2) of the ACL did not fairly form part of the
ACCC’s pleaded
The witnesses
parties called witnesses to give evidence, each of whom adopted a comprehensive
affidavit that had been prepared on the witness’s
behalf and to which was
attached a number of documents. Each witness was cross-examined.
ACCC called each of the four Consumers. In relation to two of the consumer
Consumer JT
Consumer TB
, I consider that
on the whole, each of them did his best to give accurate evidence to the Court
in accordance with his recollection.
I thought that each of the four Consumer
witnesses, and particularly
Consumer MO
, was influenced in his or
her presentation to some degree by a sense of grievance in relation to the
defects in their RV.
the case of
Consumer MO
, I formed the view that the presentation of
his evidence had by reason of the passage of time been assisted by
reconstruction, and
that in the absence of corroborative documents, it was not
in every detail reliable. I also consider that at times
Consumer MO
was prone to exaggeration. An example was that when he was cross-examined, he
stated that when his RV went in for repair at Jayco
Sydney “half the stuff
wasn’t done”. While there were items that had to receive further
attention, Jayco Sydney’s
warranty claim documents do not support
Consumer MO’s
characterisation in the terms that he used.
Having said that, for the reasons that I will explain, I do not doubt that
Consumer MO
was justified in identifying several features of his RV
that were not presented or repaired to an acceptable standard.
also formed the view that the evidence of
Consumer RH
was not wholly
reliable. Although it was not put on behalf of Jayco Corp that
Consumer RH
was not a witness of truth in relation to her
recollection, there were some aspects of her evidence which were shown to be
inconsistent
with the evidence of other witnesses whose evidence I accept. Some
of her evidence was also inconsistent with some of the objective
including that contained in business documents. I will return to these features
Consumer RH
’s evidence in more detail in due course.
Corp called two current employees, one former employee and two retired
employees. Those witnesses, from least to most senior
during the relevant
period, were Mr Peter Manning, Mr Philip Rigby, Mr Malcolm
Austin, Mr Paul Morgan, and Mr Peter Murphy. Their
respective roles
and responsibilities were as follows.
had been employed by Jayco Corp for more than a decade. He commenced in 2008 as
a service advisor, then became a service
manager, and later between 2011 and
2017 worked as a customer service manager, before moving into the spare parts
team. In his role
as a customer service manager, Mr Manning was responsible
for managing warranty requests and dealer service enquiries of various
arising in New South Wales and Queensland. He had authority to approve warranty
repairs up to $1,000, and he did not have authority
to approve refunds or
replacements. He reported to Mr Morgan, the national service manager, and
he escalated matters as necessary
to Mr Austin, Mr Rigby, or
had also been employed by Jayco Corp for more than a decade. Prior to that, he
had more than 20 years’ experience in
the RV industry in England.
Mr Rigby commenced at Jayco Corp in 2009 as a production manager, and in
2012, he was appointed to the
role of service manager. Mr Rigby continued
in that role, except for a 12 month period following Mr Austin’s
retirement in
mid-2015 until mid-2016, when he acted as interim customer
relations manager. In his role as service manager, Mr Rigby handled
repair claims. As with Mr Manning, Mr Rigby had authority to
approve warranty repairs up to $1,000, and he did not have authority
refunds or replacements, which he escalated as necessary.
was employed by Jayco Corp for more than 20 years. He commenced in 1994 as a
research and development manager, then held
a quality manager role, and finally
from 2000 until his retirement in July 2015, he was the customer relations
manager. In that role,
Mr Austin was responsible for assisting dealers and
consumers with any enquiries that they made to Jayco Corp, which spanned
queries, refund or replacement requests, and concerns that consumers
may have been experiencing with dealers or repair agents. Mr
authority to approve warranty repairs up to approximately $1,200 or $1,500, and
he did not have authority to approve refunds
or replacements. Mr Austin
reported to Mr Morgan, and it was to him that he escalated matters as
necessary, including by investigating
and making recommendations in relation to
warranty repairs above his financial limit, and requests for refunds or
replacements.
was employed as the national services manager of Jayco Corp from 2006 until
2016, when he took up work elsewhere. In that
role, Mr Morgan was
responsible for “after sales”, which incorporated customer
relations, warranty claims, overseeing
the Dandenong factory workshop,
distribution, spare parts and technical dealer training. Mr Manning,
Mr Austin and Mr Rigby reported
to him, and he reported to
Mr Murphy. Mr Morgan had authority to approve warranty repairs up to
$3,000, and he did not have authority
to approve refunds or replacements. Beyond
those limits, Mr Morgan required approval from Mr Murphy or another
senior Jayco Corp
was employed by Jayco Corp for more than 40 years, from 1976 until his
retirement in 2017. During the relevant period from
1 January 2013 to
30 June 2016, Mr Murphy held the role of research and development
manager and reported to the CEO. As part of that
role, Mr Murphy was
responsible for assessing higher value warranty repairs and requests for refunds
or replacements. Mr Murphy considered
such requests along with
recommendations made to him by Mr Morgan, and Mr Murphy had authority
to approve refunds or replacements.
formed the impression that each of the Jayco Corp employee witnesses did his
best to give reliable evidence to the Court in accordance
with his recollection,
and his perception of the issues in respect of which he was cross-examined.
Mr Morgan, in particular, was
the subject of some persistent but
appropriate cross-examination about the respective relationships between Jayco
Corp, the dealers,
and consumers. I consider that Mr Morgan was a credible,
reliable witness whose evidence stood up well against these challenges.
Corp also called Mr Damien Charleson and Mr Warwick Butcher of Jayco
Newcastle. Mr Charleson was, at the relevant times, the
dealer principal of
Jayco Newcastle. Mr Butcher was, at the relevant times, the customer
relations manager of Jayco Newcastle.
Corp also called Mr Tyrone Bilbija and Mr Jason Holman.
Mr Bilbija was, at the relevant times, the dealer principal of Jayco
Sydney. Mr Holman was, at the relevant times, the service manager of Jayco
Sydney. In that role, Mr Holman oversaw the workshop,
administration and procurement of parts for Jayco Sydney. Mr Holman did not
have authority to determine any refund or replacement
requests, which he
referred to the dealer principal of Jayco Sydney, Mr Bilbija. Prior to
taking up the service manager role at Jayco
Sydney, Mr Holman had been
employed by Jayco Corp for 14 years, starting as an installation technician and
finishing as a production
manager, while principally working on the pop top line
of RVs. At the time of giving evidence, Mr Holman was no longer employed by
Jayco Sydney, and had moved to Queensland.
Jayco Corp called Mr Barry Wells, a caravan repairman who had been
based in Bundaberg. Mr Wells had attended upon
Consumer RH
early May 2015 at a caravan park in Agnes Water, Queensland. I found
Mr Wells to be an impressive witness.
a final comment before turning to the background of the four Consumers’
RVs, I record that all counsel presented their cases
skilfully, and consistently
with an appreciation that the best advocacy is selective and economical: see,

The four Consumers’ RVs
(1) Consumer MO
Purchase and delivery of the RV
Consumer MO
purchased a 2013 Jayco Swan
Outback camper trailer from the dealer, Jayco Sydney. The agreement to purchase
was effected at the Sydney
Caravan Supershow at the Rosehill racecourse.
Consumer MO
attended the show with his wife. At the show,
Consumer MO
and his wife spoke to a salesperson from
Jayco Sydney, received a brochure for the 2013 Jayco Camper Trailer
Series, and inspected
a demonstration model of the 2013 Jayco Swan Outback
camper trailer.
Consumer MO
and his wife then left the show for
several hours, during which time he read the brochure.
Consumer MO
gave evidence that the general impression that he formed from the glossy
brochure was that the camper trailer would be of good quality
and would perform
well, that Jayco made a good quality product, and that Jayco prided itself on
quality and being an Australian-owned
caravan company. The brochure was in
evidence, and I accept
Consumer MO
’s account of the impression
Consumer MO
and his wife then returned to the caravan
show, and agreed to purchase the RV.
Consumer MO
agreed to a
purchase price of $27,990, and paid a $1,000 deposit. He arranged a loan with a
finance company to cover the balance
of the purchase price, which he paid upon
delivery of the RV in about August 2013.
Consumer MO
and his wife had never owned a caravan or camper trailer before, although they
had previously rented camper trailers to use on family
holidays. A camper
trailer, when in its towing position, has a much lower profile than a
conventional caravan. Camper trailers contain
a wind-up canvas upper section and
extendable sleeping accommodation on each side. They are easier to tow than
caravans, and are
cheaper than caravans, including pop top caravans. The
2013 Jayco Swan Outback camper trailer was one of the largest models in the
2013 Jayco Camper Trailer Series, and it was in the 2013 Jayco Outback
range. The brochure listed the features of the Outback range,
and stated that
the Outback range “had the added strength and clearance you’ll need
for rugged conditions, but there
are limits!” The below picture, which has
been extracted from the brochure, shows a Jayco Swan camper trailer in the
Consumer MO
attended Jayco Sydney to pick up
his RV. At that time,
he was provided with a copy of the Jayco
owner’s handbook and a demonstration of how to operate and maintain the
Initial concerns with the RV
Consumer MO
stated in his affidavit that after taking his RV home from Jayco Sydney, he
inspected it and identified a number of issues.
Consumer MO
that it looked like the RV had “just been slapped together”. He
stated that he identified that the bumper bar
and back of the camper trailer
were not square with the chassis, that the roof did not shut squarely because it
was misaligned, and
that the door was vibrating against the roof because there
was not enough clearance.
Consumer MO
stated that these issues made
him concerned about the overall quality of the build of the RV.
Consumer MO
did not raise these initial concerns with Jayco Sydney or Jayco Corp. During
cross-examination, senior counsel for Jayco Corp challenged
Consumer MO
on his evidence about his initial concerns with the RV.
In particular, senior counsel for Jayco Corp took
Consumer MO
online survey that was completed on 10 October 2013, which recorded that it was
completed by
Consumer MO
and in which the overall presentation of
the van, as well as the dealer and salesperson criteria, were rated as
“excellent”.
Consumer MO
responded that he did not
recall completing the survey, and suggested that his wife may have completed it.
Consumer MO
stated unequivocally that he “was not happy with
the vehicle from the word go.” Ultimately, I do not consider that it
necessary to resolve whether
Consumer MO
’s concerns with his
RV arose immediately after he took the RV home, or why his RV was positively
reviewed in the online survey.
First trips around September 2013 and concerns raised with
Jayco Sydney
around September 2013,
Consumer MO
took his first trips with
his RV to The Entrance on the New South Wales central coast, and to Newnes in
the New South Wales central
tablelands region.
Consumer MO
evidence that during those trips he noticed more issues with the RV, some of
which were minor, but which all added up and increased
his concern about the
overall quality of the build of the RV.
Consumer MO
stated that sometime after either the first or second trip, he raised his
concerns with Mr Goran Gregorovic, who was at that time
the service
manager at Jayco Sydney.
Consumer MO
stated that they had a
conversation to the following effect –
I said: I’m not happy with the camper trailer that
I have received, I have issues with it.
Goran said: If you take the van home we can order new parts from Jayco Melbourne
[presumably being a reference to the Jayco Corp
factory in Dandenong]. We will
send them photos and talk to them about how to resolve the issues.
I said: Why can’t you get another chassis that I can look over first. This
was not the standard that I paid for.
Goran said: No, this is your vehicle, we will get it fixed, this stuff is only
Consumer MO
stated that he did not agree that the issues with his RV were only cosmetic, and
that he asked Mr Gregorovic why he could not send
his RV back to Jayco Corp
and see why it was poorly built, to which Mr Gregorovic just said
“no”. The ACCC did not adduce
Consumer MO
as to whether his conversation with Mr Gregorovic referred to above was by
telephone, or in person, or whether he showed
Mr Gregorovic the features of
his RV about which he complained.
Consumer MO
was not challenged in
cross-examination about this evidence. However, I found the evidence about this
conversation and its context,
which was wholly contained in
Consumer MO’s
affidavit, to be lacking in precision and detail
in circumstances where
Consumer MO
stated in cross-examination that
it took a long period of time to prepare his affidavit, and that the ACCC had
provided much of the
timeline through documents that it had obtained. I am not
satisfied that any conversation to this effect occurred at the time suggested
the structure of
Consumer MO
’s affidavit, namely after the
first trips but before the first roof collapse in December 2013. That said,
the documentary evidence
to which I shall refer below demonstrates that
Consumer MO
and his wife communicated with Mr Gregorovic by
email in January 2014 in relation to the state of their RV, and that he
took his RV
to Jayco Sydney for assessment in March 2014.
Christmas 2013 school holidays – trip to Glen Allen and
the first roof collapse
the Christmas 2013 school holidays,
Consumer MO
took his RV to
a friend’s property in Glen Allen, which is near Brown Mountain in New
South Wales, for a holiday with five
other families. On the first day of the
Consumer MO
was winding up the roof of the RV, one of the
steel telescopic struts that held the roof up popped out, causing the roof to
in one corner.
Consumer MO
stated that with the assistance
of five other adult males at the property, and over about four hours of
“brainstorming”
and labour, he managed to put the strut back into
place so that he could raise the roof of the RV.
January 2014 – concerns raised with Jayco Sydney
8 January 2014,
Consumer MO
and his wife sent an email to
Mr Gregorovic of Jayco Sydney that referred to attached pictures and a
letter in relation to their
RV. Mr Gregorovic responded on
10 January 2014, stating that he could not access the majority of the
pictures and that the fault
descriptions were vague. On
11 January 2014,
Consumer MO
sent another email to
Mr Gregorovic, in which he relevantly stated –
Please find attached the document with photos and fault
descriptions. I hope this is a little better.
Just wanted to note that the van has been on 3 trips since we got it. They have
been fantastic trips and we are very much looking
forward to doing a bigger trip
with the family. I do find it such a shame that it seems we have been taken with
some bad workmanship.
email attached a five page document which contained 25 photographs of the RV
with captions describing the issues of concern in
the photographs. The document
did not include any reference to the roof collapse that had occurred during
Consumer MO
’s recent Christmas holiday to Glen Allen. The
issues were described as cracked bed head support pole brackets, a tap that
the bed slide, a loose tap fitting in the bench, a drawer not mounted
squarely, the bottom of a cupboard not finished properly, a
chipped door, faults
in a fly screen, a window that was sewn on crookedly, holes in a mattress,
misaligned light fittings, screws
protruding underneath the RV, inconsistency in
the finish of the wheel arches, a misaligned bumper bar, and cracks in the right
shock absorber mount welded to the chassis of the RV. There is no evidence
before the Court of any response to this email from Jayco
Consumer MO
February 2014 – concerns raised with Jayco Corp
February 2014,
Consumer MO
raised his concerns about his RV
with Jayco Corp, which in turn conveyed those concerns back to Jayco Sydney to
be addressed as repairs
under the Jayco warranty. On 2 February 2014,
Consumer MO
and his wife sent an email to
an “info” account of Jayco Corp, in which they relevantly stated
My husband and I recently bought a Jayco Swan camper
van. We have been campers for 25 years and finally bought our family our

captions describing the issues of concern in the
photographs, referred to at [
3 February 2014, Ms Andrea McCann, from the warranty division of
Jayco Corp, responded to
Consumer MO
and his wife’s email by
requesting the chassis number of their RV. On 5 February 2014,
Consumer MO
and his wife replied to Ms McCann with the
RV’s chassis number. Later that day, Ms McCann sent a further
response, which was
copied to Mr Gregorovic of Jayco Sydney, in which she
relevantly stated –
Please book [your] van into Jayco Sydney for your
concerns to be looked at and addressed. If Sydney is not convenient for you
advise me and I will supply details if possible of [a] closer repairer
I have forwarded your email onto the relevant customer service manager who
unfortunately is currently off with medical concerns.
He will respond to them
asap on his return.
still on 5 February 2014, Mr Gregorovic sent an email to
Mr Gary Cadd, who was the quality control manager at Jayco Corp, copied
Mr Manning of Jayco corp, which relevantly stated –

in the quotation at the item numbered 14 was a statement that the body of the
van was out of alignment, with 33 hours of
work attributed to that item.
24 March 2014, Mr Manning responded to Mr Gregorovic by
requesting that he “please liaise with RV Go to do a quote on this
van”. RVGO was an independent RV repairer, which was authorised to conduct
repairs under the Jayco warranty. That email was
“Accounts@RVGO”, which I infer is an RVGO email address.
Jayco Corp evidence about Mr Gregorovic
party called Mr Gregorovic, who had resigned from Jayco Sydney in
July 2014. Jayco Corp adduced evidence that portrayed Mr
Gregorovic as
unreliable, and in particular that his assessment of
Consumer MO
’s RV was unreliable. Mr Bilbija, the dealer
principal of Jayco Sydney, stated that he thought that
Mr Gregorovic’s assessment
of the issues with
Consumer MO
’s RV was unreliable, and that he had transferred
Mr Gregorovic from his role as a Jayco Sydney service manager to a
role in the service department because he considered that
Mr Gregorovic’s judgment had deteriorated. Mr Holman also gave
performance in assessing RVs, preferring his own technical assessment
experience. Mr Manning stated that from his dealings with him, he
considered that Mr Gregorovic was not the most experienced
service manager,
and that he would frequently make incorrect assessments of RVs. He stated that
at one stage, because he had lost
faith in Mr Gregorovic’s ability to
assess RVs, he requested that he refer matters to repair agents, as
Mr Gregorovic was prone
to overreaction in his dealings with customers.
Mr Manning was not challenged about this evidence. There was some objective
for the reservations that were expressed about
Mr Gregorovic’s assessment skills in the form of the differences
between his
quotation for repairs on
Consumer MO
another quotation prepared by the independent repairer, RVGO, and the warranty
claim ultimately prepared by Mr Holman
for the works that were undertaken.
I refer to these below.
April 2014 – RVGO assessment of the RV
8 April 2014,
Consumer MO
took his RV to RVGO for
assessment. Mr Michael Major, a director of RVGO, inspected the RV, and
Consumer MO
that he was able to repair all of the issues
with the RV. Later on 8 April 2014, Mr Major sent an email to
Mr Manning which set out
a quotation for repairs to be conducted on
Consumer MO
’s RV. The body of the email was as follows,
From our phone conversation this afternoon I spent 3
hours with him going through all his issue’s. I feel these can be resolved
without sending the vehicle back to the factory. I have informed him that, his
vehicle has minor problems, but nothing that can’t
be fixed. They are hand
built by good staff.
List of problems:
absorber bracket cracked – Removed shock absorber – the surface of
the galvanising is slighting cracked due to a
moving part
Action – Nothing, customer
has viewed the area with no shock absorber and was happy it was safe. I
performed this with no charge
cabinet under lounge not square
Action – Remove and
installed cabinet square to drawer and runner – estimated time –
door lock falling out of door – screws stripped in timber
Action – New door would be
ideal, but could attempt to fix if part not available – estimated time
under wardrobe not straight
Action – Nothing –
Customer didn’t know it was an access panel which is slightly
bed slides hitting tap in kitchen bench
Action – (No bench needed)
Fit stop to bed sliding mechanism to prevent issue (customer didn’t know
not to slide the bed
all the way in)
Additional – Please instruct how to fit the
misalignment – O/S/R back lower mould fitted to far out due to joining
strip cut to [sic] long, and black checked plate
installed to far back no off
side. Steel bumper bolted in to far on near side.
WALL IS NOT OUT OF ALIGNMENT
DOES NOT NEED TO BE STRIPPED
Action – Re-fit new rear body moulding, and POSSIBLY new checker plate.
Trim joining strip and install mould correctly. Est.
protruding – A number of strut tower floor mounting screws have missed the
galvanising plates – I’m sure
the thin sheets have been installed
slighting off, as checked against another swan.
Action – Possibly using
nuts and bolts to make the customer happy, my professional opinion is that it
just needs sealant, load
is vertically down, not in
in mattress cover.
Action – Requires new
front mattress cover.
and finishing issue’s with canvas
Action – Remove canvas and
send back for repair – est. time unknown as this will be our first attempt
at this procedure
rubbing and door frame causing door to wear heavily – this is a recurring
Action – Remove roof
spacers and move roof over 3-4mm to the Near side to allow roof to clear –
NEVER ATTEMPTED, but I’m
sure it will work.
Though customer requested for a new
roof corner – cracked
Action – Remove and
replace – manufacturing of corner moulding, I have discussed this with
Gary about the moulding process
sealant – Solar panel and components not sealed correctly
Action – Seal correctly
Minor issue’s
Action – Approx 3-5 hours
of small items
lights – not installed straight
strut tower – due to clip missing and strut falling apart when all the way
hockey stick bracket bent – require metal one’s please...
around inner guards, both sides aren’t sealed correctly
I would take a rough estimate of
around 35-45 hours of work to make the customer 100% happy over 3-4 weeks by the
time we get the
canvas done, etc.
We can give a list of parts & tasks required to make this van 100%.
This customer is currently happy, I have sent him away to enjoy the vehicle over
the Easter break and we’ll be in contact with
him after ANZAC day.
I hope this email is detailed enough.
Please instruct further.
set out at item 6 above, Mr Major did not by his quotation consider that
the wall of the RV was misaligned, but rather that the
problem with the
misalignment of the rear bumper was with the way the rear bumper had been
fitted. And as set out in Mr Major’s
email, after conducting his
assessment, Mr Major told
Consumer MO
that he could use his RV
for a trip over the upcoming Easter holiday before the repairs were
undertaken.
a week, on 14 April 2014, Mr Manning replied to Mr Major,
providing Jayco Corp’s authorisation for RVGO to proceed with
Consumer MO
’s RV at a cost of $3,465. Mr Manning
stated that he would have obtained Mr Morgan’s instructions to
provide that authorisation,
as the cost of the repairs was above his personal
authorisation limit. I pause to note at this point that, although
Mr Manning authorised
the repairs that had been quoted by RVGO, as events
developed, RVGO did not undertake the repair work. Repairs were later effected
by Jayco Sydney in July 2014.
April 2014 – second roof collapse
April 2014, and after his visit to RVGO for assessment,
Consumer MO
took his RV on a trip to the Hunter Valley in New South
Wales. When he returned home, he attempted to set the RV up to clean it.
was winding up the roof of the RV, the same strut popped out again, causing the
roof to collapse in one corner, and on this
occasion the pole tore through part
of the canvas.
his affidavit,
Consumer MO
stated that following this second roof
collapse, he telephoned Mr Bilbija and stated that he was “over
it” and that he
wanted a refund of the money that he paid for the RV.
Consumer MO
stated that Mr Bilbija’s response was that
Jayco Sydney would collect the RV for assessment and repairs. This evidence was
not challenged in cross-examination of
Consumer MO
. For his part,
Mr Bilbija did not deny the claimed telephone conversation in terms, but
stated that his first dealing with
Consumer MO
was at a caravan show
at Rosehill racecourse, to which I refer below. Mr Bilbija was not
challenged on his evidence that this was
his first dealing with
Consumer MO
April 2014 – conversation between Consumer MO and
Mr Bilbija of Jayco Sydney at the Rosehill caravan show
in April 2014, and before any repairs to his RV were undertaken,
Consumer MO
attended the Sydney Caravan Supershow at the Rosehill
racecourse, with the intention of confronting Jayco Sydney about the concerns
that he had with his RV. There was conflicting evidence about the content of the
discussion that took place at the show between
Consumer MO
representatives of Jayco Sydney. It was accepted that
Consumer MO
spoke to Mr Bilbija about his concerns with his RV, and that
Mr Bilbija then invited Mr Holman to join their conversation. It was
also accepted that
Consumer MO
explained the concerns that he had
with his RV by reference to a bundle of photographs of the RV that he had
brought with him to
the show. It was accepted that
Consumer MO
demonstrably unhappy with the quality of his RV, which he stated did not meet
the quality advertised in the brochure that he
had reviewed before buying the
RV, or the quality of the demonstration model RV that he had inspected at the
show the year before.
Mr Bilbija stated that he was taken aback by the
conversation, and described
Consumer MO
as very upset and agitated.
Mr Holman recorded in an email sent not long after this meeting, detailed
] below, that
Consumer MO
stated that he thought that his RV was a
“lemon” and that it “missed the quality check off
process”. I accept
Consumer MO
said words to that effect.
Consumer MO
gave evidence that he went to the show with the intention of getting a refund of
the money that he paid for the RV. He stated that
Mr Bilbija agreed with
him that there were too many issues with his RV and that the quality of the RV
was low, and that Mr Bilbija
told him that not all Jayco RVs were built
Consumer MO
stated that he demanded a refund, and that
Mr Bilbija responded with words to the effect, “What would make you
not want your
money back? If I built you a new van, would you be happy?”
Consumer MO
stated that the substance of Mr Bilbija’s
response was an offer to provide him with a replacement RV, and that in response
to Mr Bilbija’s offer to provide him with a replacement RV, he agreed
that was a good solution, and suggested that Jayco Sydney
could sell his RV
second-hand and use the proceeds of that sale to buy him a new RV from Jayco
Corp at wholesale price.
Consumer MO
stated that he and
Mr Bilbija shook hands on that agreement. Later, in a letter from
Consumer MO
to Mr Holman dated 17 August 2014, which
was after the RV was returned to him following repairs,
Consumer MO
wrote that he was “not completely happy with the final product”,
and that he was “promised by Tyrone Bilija [sic]
(the Principal owner) at
the Rosehill show 2014, that I would get a complete rebuild”. The
substance of that letter is set
] below. There was also a reference by
Mr Manning in an email of 19 August 2014, which is set out at [
] below, to a conversation with
Consumer MO
, in which he claimed that Mr Bilbija would arrange
a rebuild of the RV.
gave evidence that when
Consumer MO
explained his concerns with his
RV, Mr Bilbija considered that the issues were quite minor and only
required basic adjustment, or
were merely aesthetic and also easily repairable.
Mr Bilbija stated that he was taken aback by the conversation, particular
Consumer MO
was very upset and agitated, and that he asked
Consumer MO
, “What could Jayco Sydney do to make you a happy
customer?” Mr Bilbija stated that, in response to that question,
Consumer MO
said that he would only accept a refund or a new RV.
Mr Bilbija stated that he then said words to the effect of, “Ok,
we’ll need to get your van into the dealership to properly assess
the issues first, and then we can move forward after the
Mr Bilbija denied that he agreed to refund
Consumer MO
provide him with a replacement RV, and gave evidence that he would never commit
to a refund or replacement without first assessing
an RV. Mr Bilbija gave
evidence that he was certain of his account, as it stuck in his mind because no
other customer had ever approached
him at the show in such an agitated manner.
Mr Bilbija’s evidence was also consistent with an account that he
gave in an email
to Mr Manning on 19 August 2014, which is set
also gave evidence about his and Mr Bilbija’s conversation with
Consumer MO
at the Rosehill caravan show. Mr Holman denied that
either he or Mr Bilbija agreed with
Consumer MO
that there were
too many issues with his RV, or that the quality of the RV was low.
Mr Holman stated that Mr Bilbija asked
Consumer MO
could do to make him a happy customer, to which
Consumer MO
responded that he wanted a refund, and then Mr Bilbija asked
Consumer MO
to bring his RV to Jayco Sydney to be assessed.
Mr Holman stated that he did not recall
Consumer MO
that Jayco Sydney could sell his RV second-hand and use the proceeds of that
sale to buy him a new RV from Jayco Corp
at wholesale price. Mr Holman also
stated that neither he nor Mr Bilbija offered to provide
Consumer MO
with a replacement RV, and that there was no handshake
agreement to do so.
principal issue in the conflicting evidence is whether Mr Bilbija made an
offer to provide
Consumer MO
with a replacement RV, which
Consumer MO
accepted, or whether he simply agreed to assess the RV.
Consumer MO
, Mr Bilbija, and Mr Holman were cross-examined
on this topic. During cross-examination,
Consumer MO
Mr Bilbija maintained their accounts of the conversation, as summarised
above, while Mr Holman, when pressed, appeared to have
little recollection
of the conversation.
I am persuaded that
Consumer MO
requested that a new RV be built,
and that he and Mr Bilbija discussed the prospect of a replacement RV, I am
not persuaded that Mr
Bilbija agreed to provide a replacement RV to
Consumer MO
. I make that finding for two main reasons.
in addition to his evidence about the particular conversation itself,
Mr Bilbija gave evidence that it was not his practice to commit
to a refund
or replacement without first assessing the RV. I accept that evidence of
Mr Bilbija’s practice, which makes common
and commercial sense, and
which supports Mr Bilbija’s account.
Mr Holman revealed under cross-examination that he had little recollection
of the conversation, his record in an email sent
not long after this meeting,
detailed at [
] below, supports his
account. In that email, Mr Holman refers to
Consumer MO
demanded a replacement RV, but does not refer to any commitment by
Mr Bilbija to provide
Consumer MO
with a replacement. In fact,
the request for advice in that email is not consistent with Mr Holman, who
was present during the relevant
conversation, having any perception that
Mr Bilbija had agreed to supply
Consumer MO
with a new RV.
Further, and as I have referred to already, Mr Bilbija’s account is
supported by an email that he sent to Mr
19 August 2014, which is set out at [
Ultimately,
however, the ACCC submitted that its case did not depend upon the Court
Consumer MO
’s account of his conversation with
Mr Bilbija, including whether Mr Bilbija had agreed to replace his
Jayco Corp’s consideration of the Jayco Sydney and RVGO
repair work quotations
7 May 2014, and after the Rosehill caravan show, Jayco Sydney arranged
for a tilt trailer to collect
Consumer MO
’s RV from his home
to be brought back to Jayco Sydney.
8 May 2014, Mr Holman sent an email to Mr Manning, copied to
Mr Bilbija, providing a report of their meeting with
Consumer MO
at the Rosehill show and seeking guidance on the next
steps to be taken –
I have an issue with the unit we have had quoted for
You have approved the repairs to be carried out by RVGO. This was organised to
happen until the customer showed up at the Sydney
Show last week and was
demanding a new van to be built.
Since the van has been booked in for repair, the riser arm has come away on one
corner causing the roof to drop down and the arm
to penetrate through the vinyl
tent. Thus rendering the van un-usable to him.
He was quite upset when he was speaking to myself and Tyrone, stating clearly
that he feels that his camper is a “lemon”
and will not except [sic]

He also stats [sic] that he has inspected the vans at our Sydney site and in
comparison, he feels his van had “missed the quality
Please advise on how you would like to approach this and seek
rectification.
that day, Mr Manning responded to Mr Holman, addressing the proposed
repairs to the RV’s roof, and stating Jayco Corp’s
position that it
would not provide a replacement or refund –
I am not sure what you think; but normal tent policy is
the tent to come off and be sent back here for repair. If you have someone
that can repair; we would look at that option. Will need a quote first though.
They can order parts to repair from spares.
Jayco will not be giving owner a new camper or refund.
9 May 2014, Mr Holman forwarded that email to Mr Bilbija.
Mr Holman stated, “Have emailed and spoken to Peter Manning yesterday
(8/5/14) and explained the situation with him and he has still advised us to
repair the unit.”
12 May 2014, Mr Bilbija forwarded that email, along with the
preceding email chain which included the earlier emails between Jayco
Jayco Corp in relation to
Consumer MO
’s RV, to Mr Austin
and requested a call to discuss the matter. Later that day, Mr Austin
responded to Mr Bilbija by email,
copying Mr Manning and
Mr Morgan. Mr Austin stated that he required further information
before having a conversation with Mr Bilbija
Mr Austin also stated that he was “not happy with some of the
‘facts’ below”, and made
some comments in the body of the
earlier emails. Mr Austin’s comments on those earlier emails included
(1) In response to the email from Mr Gregorovic to
Mr Manning dated 18 March 2014 providing
Mr Gregorovic’s view on the state
Consumer MO
RV, referred to at [
Mr Austin commented “This is radically contradicted by an assessment
carried out by RVGO on 08/04/2014”.
(2) In response to the email from Mr Gregorovic to Mr Manning dated
21 March 2014 setting out Jayco Sydney’s quotation for
referred to at [
Mr Austin queried whether several of the items listed were covered by the
Jayco warranty and stated that the line-item for
re-assembling the van within
item 14 was “NOT what RVGO have diagnosed. So who is correct?” More
generally, in respect
of the differences between Jayco Sydney and RVGO’s
assessments and repair quotations, Mr Austin stated –
This needs to be re-examined to establish just what is required. The different
results from inspections by Jayco Sydney and RVGO
indicate that one of them is
severely wrong so we need to know which is correct.
(3) In response to the email from Mr Holman to Mr Manning, copied to
Mr Bilbija, dated 8 May 2014 providing a report of their meeting
Consumer MO
at the Rosehill caravan show and seeking guidance,
referred to at [
Mr Austin stated that the riser arm issue “may be due to incorrect
use, it isn’t hard to over winch and pop the
telescopic post out”,
and that “Depending on who is right (see below) [in reference to his
comment about which of Jayco
Sydney or RVGO’s assessment was correct] the
decision to repair or to refer for a replacement van to Jayco CEO will need to
(4) In response to the email from Mr Manning to Mr Holman dated
8 May 2014 addressing the proposed repairs to the RV’s roof,
referred to at [
Mr Austin stated, “If the end result of the review is that the van
should be rectified (which is Jayco’s right
if the faults are minor as per
the RVGO report) it may be [better] to install a new tent so that the work can
be expedited.”
following day, on 13 May 2014, Mr Austin sent a further email to
Mr Bilbija, copied to Mr Manning and Mr Morgan, regarding the
next steps to be taken –
There is still a difference of assessment between [you]
and RVGO regarding the body shape. RVGO say it is a simple fix. If we supply
new tent that should expedite the warranty work. Clearly RVGO believe the
mouldings have been mounted incorrectly and so all the
work on the walls is not
required. The van should go to RVGO and be repaired; Peter Manning will expedite
supply of a new tent.
I cannot refer your request to replace the van with a new one to Peter Murphy on
the information to hand. Jayco is entitled to carry
out warranty work. A
replacement van would only be agreed to for major structural or safety reasons
and this doesn’t apply.
May 2014, Mr Bilbija responded to Mr Austin and relevantly stated
I understand your position.
You do realise that our Service manager is no longer Goran [Gregorovic] and it
is Jason Holman. Who came from Jayco and the Pop Top
Line production
RV go have not long been warranty agents and I have to trust experience over
enthusiasm.
I will talk to Jason and come back to you.
forwarded his email to Mr Holman. During cross-examination, Mr Bilbija
explained that his comment in that email that he
had to trust experience over
enthusiasm was in support of his position that he would prefer for
Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney, rather
than RVGO, to assess and repair
Consumer MO
on 14 May 2014, Mr Holman sent an email to Mr Bilbija,
copied to Mr Austin, in which he relevantly stated –
I will start to take apart this unit and assess the
I will touch base with [
Consumer MO
] and let him know that Jayco
have to undergo certain steps to diagnose the extent of the problem.
I will let you know my findings.
still on 14 May 2014, Mr Austin forwarded that email to
Mr Manning stating “[o]ver to you”, Mr Manning responded
“I thought RVGO were going to do this one?”, and Mr Austin
replied “So did I but it seems Jayco Sydney know best.”
Mr Manning then sent an email to Mr Holman, copied to Mr Austin,
asking Mr Holman to “keep me [Mr Manning] updated as I thought
RVGO had this one under control.” Ultimately, as will be seen, Jayco
Sydney performed the repair works on
Consumer MO
Consumer MO
stated that sometime in the ensuing weeks, he telephoned Jayco Sydney to get an
update on the status of his RV, which had been collected
from his home on
7 May 2014.
Consumer MO
stated that someone from Jayco
Sydney, whose name he could not recall, informed him that, contrary to his
understanding, he was not
receiving a replacement RV, stating words to the
effect of “Jayco Corporation wouldn’t go for it”, and that
Sydney was waiting on parts to repair his RV, and that he would need to
deal with Jayco Sydney to get his RV repaired.
Consumer MO
that he did not seek to rely on the purported agreement struck with
Mr Bilbija at the caravan show for Jayco Sydney to replace
his RV because
he had “lost energy” with the process of dealing with Jayco
Consumer MO
gave evidence that “around this time”, but not recalling when, he
called Jayco Corp and conducted a telephone conversation
with a person he
identified in his affidavit as “Phil”, but whom in oral
evidence-in-chief he identified as Mr Manning,
with his RV. He stated that the person told him that he would have to speak to
Jayco Sydney about any
issues that he was having with his RV and that Jayco
Sydney was responsible for the RV and any remedy provided to him, and that it
was not up to Jayco Corp to provide any remedy including a refund or
replacement. When this account was put to Mr Manning during
cross-examination, Mr Manning said that he could not recall that
conversation but that it was quite possible that he would have directed
Consumer MO
to his selling dealer, being Jayco Sydney. I will return
Consumer MO
’s evidence about this conversation when
addressing the ACCC’s misrepresentation claims.
July 2014 – Jayco Sydney repair work
or about 21 July 2014, Jayco Sydney undertook repairs on
Consumer MO
’s RV. Jayco Sydney produced a warranty claim
document, which set out the repair works performed and by reference to which
Sydney sought reimbursement from Jayco Corp. The warranty claim stated
that the repair works required a total of 13.5 hours of labour,
and that the
cost was $1,012.50 in labour and $60.05 in parts, for a total cost with GST of
$1,179.80. The actual time and cost was
considerably lower than what had been
first quoted by Mr Gregorovic, and what had been quoted by RVGO. The
warranty claim included
17 line items of repair work, each with a

warranty claim document records that the claim was approved by Jayco Corp on
30 September 2014, and Mr Manning gave evidence that
over his financial limit, it would have been approved by
August 2014 – return of the RV and
Consumer MO’s further concerns
Consumer MO
RV to his home.
Consumer MO
was not at home, and his wife accepted
delivery of the RV.
Consumer MO
gave evidence that the weekend after
his RV was returned, he thoroughly inspected the RV and identified further
issues with it.
17 August 2014,
Consumer MO
sent an email to
Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney and the “info” account of Jayco Corp.
That email was also copied to “tyrone.bililjah@jaycosydney.com.au”,
which was not Mr Bilbija’s email address, and therefore
Mr Bilbija did not receive the email. The email attached a letter in
Consumer MO
set out his concerns with the RV,
Thank you for returning our van. I have had the
opportunity over the weekend (9/8/14) to have a thorough look over it. Below are
details of what I have found:

I am not completely happy with the final product. I was
promised by Tyrone Bilbija (the Principal owner) at the Rosehill show 2014,
I would get a complete rebuild. This did not happen. I was also told we would
receive an extended warranty, this has not been
offered. We have continued to
pay off our finance on the van whilst it was taken for repairs. It was taken

letter included eight photographs, which illustrated, point by point, some of
the identified concerns with the RV.
18 August 2014, Mr Manning sent a response to
Consumer MO
, Mr Holman, and Ms McCann, which relevantly
Hi Jason [Holman],
Please let me know how you go with this one.
Please book in to have any remaining items addressed under warranty. We
don’t see this requiring a refund for the owner. Repairs
will be covered
under the Jayco warranty plans.
on 18 August 2014, Mr Holman also sent a reply to
Consumer MO
, which relevantly stated –
Thank you for the information you have supplied me in
regards to your Swan Camper R13784.
Sorry to hear that you are not happy with the final product. I strongly urged
that you could be present when we delivered your camper
back so that you could
inspect the works yourself. My understanding is that Mrs [MO] was happy with the
works carried out when the
camper was wound up and that no issues were reported
upon delivery.
I confirm that your van is repairable, in our opinion the repairs are not deemed
to be major and does not substantiate your request
for a replacement van or
money back.
Jayco Sydney is willing to provide the following at no cost to
Transport your van chassis R13784, to and from
your place of residence to complete repairs.
Jayco Sydney will supply a further 12 month warranty on all repairs
completed once your van is returned to you.
I formally ask for your approval to transport your van
to and from Jayco Sydney for repairs to be completed.
I await your approval so that I can move ahead with the repairs required on your
next day, on 19 August 2014, Mr Manning sent an email to
Mr Bilbija, copied to Mr Holman, in relation to a telephone
conversation
that he had recently had with
Consumer MO
could no longer recall when giving evidence in this proceeding. That email
relevantly stated –
Owner has been trying to talk to you about his camper
and your commitments. Apparently you said he would get a rebuild. But in the
he was told you repaired the camper instead. Of which not all is fixed anyway.
He’s not happy about the decision to change
without notice.
He has spoken to Jason but wants to talk to you.
Can you please call him to discuss. He is not happy.
Apparently the owner says that the warranty should be extended by 12 months. We
do not know about this. I have currently extended
it by 3 months but will [be]
extended out to 12 months if you give me the go ahead everything is alright with
on 19 August 2014, Mr Bilbija replied to Mr Manning with his
own account of his dealings with
Consumer MO
Jason and I had a sit down with the customer while the
Sydney [show] was on. He walked on to the stand and demanded to talk to me.
you would be aware it was not the best time for me to deal with this type of
complaint as the Sydney I [sic] the most busiest
sale time of the year for me

with his camper. We went through all the issues and the major one was his roof

Upon inspection of [

got through to him he let him know that we were waiting on his new tent to

August 2014 – further repair work by Jayco Sydney
22 August 2014, Jayco Sydney conducted further repairs on
Consumer MO
’s RV. Jayco Sydney again produced a warranty claim
document, which set out the repair works performed on
Consumer MO
’s RV and by reference to which Jayco Sydney sought
reimbursement from Jayco Corp. The warranty claim stated that the repair
required a total of 1.75 hours of labour (inclusive of 0.5 hours attributed to
an administration fee), and the cost was $131.25
in labour and nothing for
parts, for a total cost with GST of $144.38. The warranty claim included six
line items of repair works,
(1) an item which stated “Poor Fit” as the
reason, with the description “Roof to body is still 12mm in mis-alignment.

gave evidence that on 9 September 2014, Jayco Corp automatically
approved the warranty claim for the repair works, as the
modest value was within
a threshold for automatic approval.
stated that when
Consumer MO
came to Jayco Sydney to collect his RV
after those repair works were completed, Mr Holman demonstrated to
Consumer MO
that other similar RVs at Jayco Sydney had very similar
roof alignment to his RV, and Mr Holman also discussed the repairs to
that all of
Consumer MO
’s concerns had been addressed.
Consumer MO
stated that when he collected his RV, nothing had
changed with the corner moulding, the roof was still misaligned as he could
fit his finger up one side between the closed roof and the RV, and one
corner had no tolerance so when he took the RV on the road,
the movement kept
cracking the plastic corner mould cover.
Consumer MO
said that he
took photographs of his RV when he collected it following these repairs.
However, it does not appear that those photographs
are before the Court. There
are a number of photographs dated 9 and 10 August 2014, but this was
prior to the repair work on 22 August
2014. The photographs annexed to
Consumer MO
’s affidavit from the relevant period included a
group of photographs dated 25 August 2014, which are stated to be of
Consumer MO
’s neighbour’s Jayco RV, and another group of
photographs dated 6 September 2014, which are stated to be of other
camper trailers at Jayco Sydney. Despite this absence of photographs of
Consumer MO
’s RV, I find that after these repairs, there
remained a misalignment with the roof of
Consumer MO
This inference arises from the first item of the Jayco Sydney warranty claim
document that stated that “nothing
can be done” to fix the defect
caused by a “poor fit” resulting in a 12 millimetre
misalignment between the roof
and the body of the RV.
Consumer MO’s later concerns with his RV
Consumer MO
collected his RV from Jayco Sydney following the repairs
conducted on 22 August 2014, he had no further dealings with Jayco
or Jayco Corp in relation to the RV.
Consumer MO
evidence that he has continued to develop new concerns about his RV. He
that when he takes the RV away, something small is always
breaking. He gave evidence of a trip in October 2017, in which he found
that the sun roof was leaking, the bed ends collapsed on multiple occasions, the
handle of the water pump came off, there were splits
in the front boot section
where the door was previously replaced, and the plastic corner moulds remained
cracked. Photographs taken
Consumer MO
of cracks in a corner
mould and on the piano hinge on the mounting front boot lid of the RV dated
12 October 2017 were in evidence.
However, apart from the cracked
mouldings, I do not consider that these other matters are in issue, as they are
not the subject of
any specific plea in the ACCC’s concise statement in
the particulars relating to

reasonable time, the RV was not fit for purpose, and that a reasonable consumer

’s position would not have spent more than
$27,000 on the RV, had he or she known that it would be affected by the previous
and existing defects, thereby seeking to engage the concept of
in s 260 of the ACL. The ACCC submitted that, in addition, two
of Jayco Sydney’s service technicians, Mr Gregorovic and
Bishop, who was referred to in Mr Gregorovic’s email to
Mr Manning on 18 March 2014 (see [
] above), had identified that the RV
was not as well put together as other RVs sold by that dealership, and that the
Court can readily
infer that it did not match the demonstration model shown to
Consumer MO
at the time of purchase.

the goods, and to seek a refund of the purchase price or a replacement.
group of defects alleged by the ACCC, I find that upon
delivery or within a short period of normal use thereafter, the RV exhibited
number of instances of poor workmanship in its build. The bumper bar and rear of
the body of the camper trailer were not square,
a crack developed in the
galvanized coating of a shock absorber mount, and many features of the interior
of the RV were poorly finished.
The photographs that
Consumer MO
took of his RV that were presented to Jayco Sydney and subsequently to Jayco
Corp in early 2014 demonstrate poor quality finishing
on the door, poorly
finished stitching to parts of the insect screen on the tent section of the RV,
instances of poor quality joinery
inside the RV, misaligned light fittings, and
a mattress which contained holes in its covering. I consider that all of these
rendered the RV to be not of acceptable quality for the purposes of the
guarantee under s 54 of the ACL. I did not understand this
to be disputed
by Jayco Corp, which had Jayco Sydney attend to most of these items when
undertaking warranty work in July-August
2014. A summary of Jayco
Sydney’s warranty claim dated 21 July 2014 is set out at [
] above. The tent section had to be
replaced for reasons that were independent of the poor finish on the insect
screen, namely the
holes that were caused by the failure of the strut in
April 2014. Otherwise, for completeness, I take to be within the defects
by the first item in the ACCC’s particulars all the matters that
were the subject of repairs that were recorded in Jayco Sydney’s
claim document.
his affidavit,
Consumer MO
referred to gaps between the body of the
camper trailer and the roof that he identified shortly after taking delivery of
He was not directly challenged in cross-examination about this evidence.
It is noteworthy that when
Consumer MO
made his initial complaints
January and February 2014,
he made no mention of any misalignment of the
roof, or to the collapse of the roof in December 2013. However,
Mr Holman of Jayco
Sydney stated in his affidavit that when
Consumer MO
attended the caravan show at Rosehill in
April 2014, he complained that his RV was “out of square to the
roof”. In his
affidavit, Mr Holman stated that when he looked over
the RV sometime after 8 May 2014, he thought that there was not much
it, and that the roof was sitting correctly. It appears that the roof
became misaligned, because there are photographs demonstrating
the misalignment,
Consumer MO
submitted to Jayco Sydney on
17 August 2014. Further, and as I have mentioned, in its warranty
claim dated 22 August 2014, Jayco
Sydney referred to a 12mm
misalignment between the roof and the body, stating that “nothing can be
done”. Mr Holman stated
in his affidavit that the misalignment was a
“very standard difference and within tolerances for that alignment”.
cross-examination, Mr Holman accepted that there was a series of
manufacturing faults and issues with the build quality of
Consumer MO’s
RV. The tenor of his evidence was that they were
all readily fixed. Mr Holman was not challenged about his observations of
alignment in May 2014, or his statement that the alignment as it
appeared in August 2014 was within tolerances. The ACCC did not
other evidence, such as expert evidence, relating to the alignment of the roof.
Consumer MO
made a number of other complaints about screws protruding from the underside
of the RV. The protruding screws may not have become
apparent to a reasonable
consumer but for the other problems relating to fit and finish of the RV that
were patent, which I find
Consumer MO
on a course of detailed
examination of his RV. By themselves, I am not persuaded that the protruding
screws rendered the RV to be
not of acceptable quality, but in the context of
the other quality issues, they contributed to the overall picture of poor
workmanship.
am not satisfied that
Consumer MO
reported any faults in his RV to
Jayco Sydney in late 2013, as alleged by the ACCC. I find that the first
report to Jayco Sydney was
on 8 January 2014 by the email from
Consumer MO
and his wife to which I referred at [
] above, which was followed up in the
email dated 11 January 2014, the substance of which was repeated in an
email to Jayco Corp dated
2 February 2014 to which I referred at [
] above. As I have indicated, it is
relevant to the overall picture that neither of these emails mentioned any roof
alignment issues,
or any claim that the roof had collapsed in December 2013, or
that the door vibrated against the roof.
relation to the
item in the ACCC’s particulars relating to
Consumer MO
’s RV, namely the roof collapse in
December 2013, I accept
Consumer MO
’s evidence that the
roof collapsed as he described, but I am not persuaded that this was caused by
any irremediable fault in
the RV. As I have mentioned, it was not the subject of
any complaint to Jayco Sydney or Jayco Corp in the emails of 8 and
11 January,
or 2 February 2014. I do not accept the ACCC’s
Consumer MO
showed photographs of the roof collapse to
Jayco Sydney in February 2014. The photographs that were sent by
Consumer MO
to Jayco Sydney and Jayco Corp in January and
February 2014 did not depict any defect in the strut for the roof. The
email communications
between Jayco Sydney and Jayco Corp at this time do not
support an inference that
Consumer MO
presented photographs in
February 2014 of a roof collapse. However, I find that
Consumer MO
took his RV to Jayco Sydney for assessment in March 2014, and at that
point a problem with one of the struts was identified to Jayco
Sydney. I make
this finding because in the quotation that Mr Gregorovic prepared dated
21 March 2014 (see [
above), an allowance of one hour for labour was made to replace the near side
front riser. In the quotation that RVGO prepared dated
14 April 2014
] above), under item 13,
which was described as a few minor issues, an allowance was made for a clip that
was missing on the near
side strut tower. While elements of Jayco Corp’s
case faintly suggested that the problem with the struts might have been caused
by user error, Jayco Corp did not put to
Consumer MO
that he had
handled the roof of the RV in a manner that was outside normal use. I find that
the failure of the strut occurred within
the course of normal use of the RV, and
constituted a breach of the guarantee of acceptable quality.
relation to the
item in the ACCC’s particulars, I am
satisfied that in April 2014 after
Consumer MO
had returned
from an Easter trip to the Hunter Valley with his RV, the strut failed again at
his home. However, I infer that
Consumer MO
must have been able to
raise and maintain the roof while away on this trip. I also infer that the
problem had not appeared to be
so serious that it had prevented
Consumer MO
from embarking on the trip, which was consistent with
advice that he had received from Mr Major of RVGO, who had examined the RV
on 8 April 2014 (see [
above). I find that the second failure was likely a further emanation of the
earlier problem with the strut, only on this occasion
there was consequential
damage, including the tearing of the tent section, and possible misalignment of
the other three struts, all
of which were removed and replaced by Jayco Sydney
in July-August 2014. I find that the second failure of the roof lifting
and the consequential damage during the course of normal use was also
the result of a breach of the guarantee of acceptable quality.
item alleged by the ACCC in its particulars comprises the several
items that were the subject of
Consumer MO
’s letter to
Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney dated 17 August 2014 (see [
] above). I find that most of these
items were cosmetic in nature. That is not to say that
Consumer MO
was not justified in drawing them to the attention of Jayco Sydney. He was
entitled to insist that the fit and finish of his RV following
the repairs be of
an acceptable standard. Most of the items were fixed by Jayco Sydney at modest
cost, as the warranty claim document
dated 22 August 2014 in the sum
of $144.38 evidences (see [
above). The exception is the 12mm misalignment of the roof over the body when it
was in the closed position. I find, by reference
to photographs of other camper
trailers that were in evidence, that those other camper trailers did not have
this misalignment. Those
other RVs were the new RVs at Jayco Sydney that
Consumer MO
photographed, and an RV belonging to
Consumer MO’s
neighbour, which he photographed. Mr Holman
stated in his affidavit that he recalled showing
Consumer MO
five similar RVs in the yard of Jayco Sydney to demonstrate that the roof
alignment was similar to his. Mr Holman also stated
in his affidavit that
the misalignment of 12mm was a “very standard difference and within
tolerances for that alignment”.
He stated that it would not cause any
operational issues with the RV, and that he would expect to see it on any model
of that RV.
The ACCC did not challenge Mr Holman’s affidavit evidence
that the roof alignment was within normal tolerances. I infer that
Jayco Sydney,
after consultation with Jayco Corp, did not explore what adjustments might be
made to improve the alignment, accepting
that “nothing could be
done”. That inference is supported by the limited amount of time that
Jayco Sydney recorded in
its warranty claim document dated
22 August 2014, namely 1.75 hours (inclusive of 0.5 hours attributed
to an administration fee),
and in particular the fact that no time was charged
in respect of the 12 millimetre misalignment of the roof.
item alleged by the ACCC in its particulars comprises the residual
items following the second repair, being the roof alignment, and
cracked corner
mouldings. In his affidavit,
Consumer MO
described his
dissatisfaction with the corner mouldings following the second set of repairs.
He also produced a photograph taken
on 12 October 2017, showing a
further crack in the corner moulding that he stated commenced shortly after it
had been fixed in August
2014. He stated in his affidavit that the corner
moulding had no tolerance, so that when he took the RV on the road, the movement
caused cracking in the corner moulding.
Consumer MO
challenged about this evidence.
find that the cracks to the corner mouldings were likely the result of
manufacturing and design defects in the mouldings. The brochure
for the Jayco
camper trailers that
Consumer MO
read stated that for 2013
“all Jayco Camper Trailers feature an innovative new roof”, and
referred to “the sleek
new design” incorporating ABS corner moulds.
By December 2013, responsible persons at Jayco Corp, including
Mr Murphy, were
aware that the corner moulds on its camper roofs were
cracking. This is evident from email communications at that time that were
tendered. Mr Murphy accepted in cross-examination that the cause of the
cracking was predominantly a manufacturing defect. Mr Holman
stated in his
affidavit that there had been a faulty batch of corner caps at the relevant
time. Mr Major of RVGO recorded in his
quotation dated
8 April 2014 (see [
above), “manufacturing of corner moulding, I have discussed this with Gary
thereby suggesting a
manufacturing issue. Jayco Sydney’s warranty claim document dated
21 July 2014 (see [
above) recorded at item 13 that three corner moulds were found to be cracked.
Was Consumer MO entitled to reject the RV?
Consumer MO
requested the supplier, Jayco Sydney, to
furnish him with a refund or a replacement RV on three occasions. The
occasion was in April 2014 after the second roof collapse in a
telephone conversation with Mr Bilbija (see [
] above). The
Consumer MO
’s attendance at the caravan show at the
Rosehill racecourse in April 2014 (see [
] above). And the
occasion was
Consumer MO
’s letter to Jayco Sydney dated
17 August 2014, which was copied to Jayco Corp, and to which I
referred at [
] above, in which he
requested a full refund.
ACCC submitted that a reasonable consumer would not have purchased the RV had he
or she known about all the issues that ensued,
and that the RV was not
substantially fit for purpose. The ACCC relied on the number of problems with
the RV, that it was substantially
different in apparent quality from the
demonstration RV that
Consumer MO
had seen at the Rosehill caravan
show in 2013, the time it took from early May to early August to effect
repairs, and the remaining
defects that were alleged, namely the misalignment of
the roof and the cracked corner moulding.
Corp submitted that the issues raised by
Consumer MO
manufacturing defects and, in any event, were little more than cosmetic and were
easily and cheaply repaired and fixed. Jayco
Corp submitted that none was a
major failure.
question whether the failure to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality
was a major failure in the case of
Consumer MO
question of fact and degree. As Jayco Corp submitted, many of the defects were,
by themselves, minor or cosmetic
and most of them were repaired. That
observation will become relevant when I come to consider later whether Jayco
Corp engaged in
conduct that was in all the circumstances unconscionable.
However, I have come to the view that the failure to comply with the statutory
guarantee of acceptable quality in the case of
Consumer MO
was a major failure by reason of the cumulative effect of the defects.
RV purchased by
Consumer MO
was at a price of $27,990. While this
was the least expensive of the four RVs the subject of this proceeding, that was
of the fact that
Consumer MO
’s RV was a camper
trailer, rather than a pop top van. I take judicial notice of the fact that the
price paid was about the
equivalent of a reasonable small to medium-sized new
motor vehicle, and was a significant proportion of the median annual personal
income before tax in Australia at that time. At that price point, a reasonable
consumer was entitled to expect a commensurate level
of quality, including fit
and finish. That expectation is consistent with the brochure that Jayco Corp
published, and which
Consumer MO
read, which was calculated to
convey the impression that a Jayco camper trailer was a durable, quality
combination of defects with the RV had the cumulative effect that the RV as a
whole was not acceptable in appearance and finish,
and its presentation was not
consistent with the impression conveyed by the Jayco brochure. The joinery was
substandard, exhibiting
poor workmanship such as a drawer not being square, and
the problem with the placement of the tap. The bed supports were not durable.
Screws were missing from the joinery and from the exterior of the RV. The
internal lights were misaligned. Screws that penetrated
through the floor of the
RV were not sealed, and were accepted by Jayco Sydney as a manufacturing fault.
The silicon sealing was
not up to acceptable standards. The stitching on the
insect screen exhibited poor workmanship. The misalignment of the rear of the
was further evidence of poor quality control. All these items, and a few more,
are referred to in Jayco Sydney’s warranty
claim document dated
21 July 2014. More seriously, the lifting apparatus for the tent
section failed. While Jayco Corp sought to
minimise the significance of this
failure, it did not put to
Consumer MO
that he had mishandled the
RV, or that the failure occurred otherwise than during the course of normal use.
The failure of the strut
on the second occasion caused the tent section to tear,
and caused other struts to become misaligned, requiring their replacement.
regard to the unchallenged evidence of Mr Holman on this topic, and his
reference to normal tolerances, I am not persuaded
to find that the 12
millimetre misalignment of the roof when in the closed position contributed to a
major failure of the RV to comply
with the statutory guarantee of acceptable
quality. However, I am persuaded that the manufacturing and design defect
relating to
the corner mouldings so contributed. The existence of a
manufacturing and design defect in the corner mouldings, and the known
of them to crack would, in combination with all the other matters to
which I have referred, have had the result that the RV would
not have been
acquired by a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the nature and extent of
the failure. In coming to this conclusion,
I have imputed to the reasonable
consumer knowledge of the price of the RV, and the claims made in Jayco’s
brochure for the
2013 camper trailers. I have stated that the reasonable
consumer has a degree of tolerance for defects in complex goods such as RVs
might be the subject of repair under the ACL rights, or under a
manufacturer’s warranty. Jayco submitted that all the
defects in the RV
were repairable. I am not persuaded that was the case in relation to the cracked
corner moulds. But otherwise,
Jayco’s attitude that all the defects were
repairable was a product of its view that almost everything was repairable owing
to the nature of the goods, and the fact that they were made from component
parts within Australia. But whether the RV was easily
repairable was only one
permissible consideration under the statutory test for determining whether there
was a major failure. The
statutory test is sufficiently engaged if the goods
would not have been acquired by a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the
nature and extent of the failure. Whether the reasonable consumer’s level
of tolerance for defects that can be repaired is
stretched to the point that the
goods would not have been acquired is a question of fact and degree. Here, the
number and disparate
nature of the problems with
Consumer MO
RV, and the way that in combination they reflected poorly on the build quality
of the RV, exceeded the reasonable consumer’s
levels of tolerance: see
Lord Dunedin’s reference to “a congeries of defects” in
W & S Pollock & Co v Macrae
1922 SC 192
200. In consequence,
Consumer MO
was entitled in April 2014 to
reject the RV on the ground that the failure to comply with the guarantee of
acceptable quality was
a major failure.
view of the above findings, it is unnecessary that I consider the delay in
Consumer MO’s
RV and whether it contributed to the
RV being not substantially fit for purpose. However, for the sake of
completeness, I make the
following findings. As a result of the failure of the
strut for the tent section on the second occasion in April 2014, the RV was
substantially unfit for purpose. In April 2014,
Consumer MO
requested a refund of the purchase price or a replacement RV, but Jayco
Sydney determined to repair it.
Consumer MO
acquiesced in Jayco
Sydney’s proposal to repair the RV, stating in his affidavit that he felt
like he had no other option but
to let them try to repair it, apprehending that
neither Jayco Sydney nor Jayco Corp would be prepared to supply him with a new
Repair of the RV was thus a remedy that was available to Jayco Sydney. Jayco
Sydney collected the RV on 7 May 2014, and returned
it in early
August 2014. There were delays in effecting repairs to the RV. The main
cause of the delay was delay in the supply of
a new tent section. While some
delay in procuring a major item such as a new tent section might be reasonable,
I do not consider
that a reasonable consumer would regard as acceptable the
delay that occurred here. However, I have determined that the failure to
complete the repairs to the tent section within a reasonable time was not a
ground on which
Consumer MO
was entitled to reject the RV as being
substantially unfit for purpose. That is because by the time
Consumer MO
requested a full refund by his letter dated 17 August 2014, the
tent section had already been repaired, and I do not consider that
the remaining
items referred to in
Consumer MO’s
letter rendered the RV
substantially unfit for purpose for the purposes of s 260(c) of the
(2) Consumer TB
Purchase and delivery of the RV
25 February 2013,
Consumer TB
purchased a 2013 Jayco
Expanda pop top RV from the dealer, Jayco Sydney. Below is a picture of a Jayco
Expanda from its Outback range,
copied from a Jayco
are two relevant features of Expanda vans for present purposes, and which were
also present in the RV purchased by
Consumer JT
, to which I shall
come. The first is that the van is a “pop top”. The height of the
van is somewhat lower than a full
sized RV. However, when the van is set up, the
roof of the van may be raised thereby increasing the ceiling height. The second
is that the RV may be expanded by raising panels at the ends of the RV,
which are referred to as “lids”. The panels then
form a rigid
roof-like structure over what are referred to as “tents”, which are
made of canvas.
Consumer TB
agreed to a purchase price of $38,916, and paid a $1,000 deposit. He
borrowed money from his parents to help him pay the remainder of the
purchase price, which he paid on 23 May 2013, when he took delivery
the RV at Jayco Sydney.
Consumer TB
and his family had considerable experience with the Jayco brand. He and his wife
had purchased a used 2004 Jayco Expanda in 2010,
which they wanted to
upgrade to a new model, which would be their third Jayco RV.
Consumer TB
’s parents and also his parents-in-law had Jayco
RVs, and his sister was in the market for a Jayco RV.
Consumer TB
wanted a new RV with a hard lid over the bed ends, as his experience was that
the canvas bed ends on his existing RV took a long
time to dry after rain in the
Canberra winter.
Consumer TB
undertook research to identify the best
RV for his family, including by reading Jayco brochures and speaking to a number
dealers. He read the Jayco Expanda Caravans and Pop Tops 2013 brochure,
which stated in respect of the hard lids on those models,
“simply lift up
the hard lid and lower the bed (which is sealed tight with our Boltaflex
weather-resistant tent material”
and “solid fibreglass roof over bed
ends“. This accorded with
Consumer TB
’s recollection of
his conversations with Jayco dealers about the benefits of the hard lids, and
what he was looking for in
his new RV. In particular,
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that before buying his new RV, he spoke to a salesman at
Jayco Sydney, Mr David Thomas, who spoke of the
high quality build of the
RV and reassured him that the hard lid would provide good weather protection to
the bed ends.
May 2013 – initial concerns with the RV
Consumer TB
stated that after taking delivery of his RV at Jayco Sydney on
23 May 2013, he used it to stay in a national park in Sydney. He
that on that first night, rain leaked into the RV, causing the
mattresses to become soaked. He stated that the following day, on
May 2013, he telephoned Mr Thomas of Jayco Sydney to seek
advice about his concerns with the RV, namely the leaking, and also a scratch
the side of the RV, and cracks on the bed lids near the hinge.
Consumer TB
stated that Mr Thomas asked whether he had seasoned
the canvas of the RV, which
Consumer TB
confirmed that he had done,
and that Mr Thomas suggested that

cross-examination,
Consumer TB
was challenged on his evidence that
he seasoned the canvas above the bed ends of his RV in accordance with the
guidance in the owner’s
handbook. As I have set out at [
] above, the owner’s handbook
advised that the canvas be soaked and left to dry completely, twice, before use.
During cross-examination,
Consumer TB
gave evidence that, in fact,
he did not follow that advice before using the RV because he sprayed the canvas
only once with water
on the afternoon that he picked it up, and he was not sure
whether it had completely dried before his family stayed in it that night.
25 May 2013,
Consumer TB
sent a series of emails to Mr Thomas
I will send through a few photos.
This photo is the cracking on the underside [of] the hard lid. All corners have
similar cracking?
[That email attached a photo of what appears to be a crack on a hard surface,
which I infer was one of the bed lids on
Consumer TB
second email stated –
Hard to see but inside of canvas above beds getting wet
from the dripping of hard lid.
[That email attached a photograph which does not clearly identify any defect on
Consumer TB
third email stated –
Video showing signs [of] the after effect of the rain.
It wasn’t raining at this point but you can see where it was dripping
pooling. During the rain it was dripping significantly, Enough that I had to
keep pushing it up from the inside to get rid of
the water that had pooled. The
canvas now seems to sag at each corner, more so [at] the front
email attached a short video which was in evidence which depicted a pool of
water on the tent section under the hard bed lid.
fourth email stated –
Sorry should have added this to the previous emails but
the only other issue is that at the rear bed the density of the mattress is
completely different between the front section and the back section. So when you
lay on the bed you sink on the front edge but it
[is] hard on the back part of
the mattress.
27 May 2013,
Consumer TB
had not received a response from
Mr Thomas, so he sent a follow up email, in which he relevantly stated
Just wondering how things are progressing regarding my
I am particularly worried about the leaking hard tops as they could also leak
when it is stored and with the Canberra weather I don’t
want the canvas
getting wet as it will not dry quickly.
Another question; is it normal that the air co makes a faint fan noise after it
is turned off.
Consumer TB
stated that he also spoke to Mr Thomas on the telephone, and that
Mr Thomas referred him to the Jayco Sydney service manager at that
Mr Gregorovic.
on 27 May 2013, Mr Gregorovic replied to
Consumer TB
’s emails to Mr Thomas, relevantly as follows
Thanx for the emails and photos, not seeing the van in
person it’s a bit hard to be exact, but going off the pics I’ll
my best ... !
1. The water on top of the front bed section is a common occurrence and
it’s due to the bed lid sloping towards the caravan
directing any rain
towards the hinge and running onto the tent section. No Fix.
2. With regards to water dripping down from the ceiling, is very unlikely due to
the top section being vinyl not canvas, the marks
that are in the pic look to be
from condensation, the van need[s] air flow to avoid that. A warm van on a cold
night that’s
fully sealed with people sleeping can and will accumulate
condensation.
3. The scratch on the side of the van is a hard one, looks like there’s
also some silicon there, could it be part of the silicon
smear .. ? If not then
will require a repair.
4. Cracks at hinge end of the bed lids are a standard item, due to having
re-enforcement added in that section, normal flexing causes
them. Not structural
only cosmetic.
5. The mattress issue could be a foam density issue if both sections of foam are
a different colour, more than likely it’s
just because the back part of
mattress is thinner (can’t compress as much) and the front is thicker (can
compress more with
a similar weight) and there is a different feeling because of
that. If the two bits of foam are different then can be a warranty
replacement.
I have noticed that you guys are in the ACT, please give this guy a call (auth

further concerns ..
Consumer TB
stated that when he received that email, he was “pretty gutted”, in
particular because Mr Gregorovic stated that the
leaking bed lid was a
common occurrence, whereas he had been reassured before buying the RV that the
hard bed lids would provide
good weather protection.
following day, on 28 May 2013,
Consumer TB
Mr Gregorovic, copied to Mr Thomas, relevantly as follows
Thanks for prompt reply.
I am concerned about some of your responses.
This caravan was designed with a hard lid to protect the bed end from rain and
other elements. Both my parents and sister have a
jayco expanda with hard lids
and have very recently travelled together and experienced heavy rain but did not
identify a leaking
hard cover as an issue. This is occurring at both ends of the
van. We may have been better off keeping my 2004 expanda which used
cover the bed ends and did not result in a leaking van. If the hard lid leaks
like it has done in both heavy and light rain
then what will it do when we are
driving with the rain been [sic] forced towards the hinge under driving
pressure? It would result
in water coming in and pooling around the bed ends
that are only protected by the canvas and would need to be dried out before
We purchased this van with the knowledge and guidance from [a] salesman that the
benefit of a hard lid was for weather protection
which is contradicting your
statements.
We have spent $40000 on a hard top lid that does not protect us from rain. Again
I refer to my family who do not experience the same
In regards to the water inside the top section of the bed ends (vinyl) - this
was not caused by condensation. The water marks you
saw on the pictures were
directly below where the water was dripping from the hard lid. This may give you
some idea about how much
water was leaking. I had to push the top of the vinyl
up approximately 5 times throughout the night as it was sagging so much. I
am fully aware of the need for a van to be ventilated to reduce condensation,
hence why we did and always have done, slept with windows
ajar, zip window under
awning 50% open, and bed ends with the zips slightly unzipped.
I am concerned that cracks are considered a standard item. Again I refer to my
family who do not have the same issue?
The scratch is not silicon and is in need of repair, although I am concerned
that we will be left with some imperfections after repair.
Not something that
you would expect in a new van.
The mattress is also a repair/replacement issue as the foam (although I thought
they were meant to be inner sprung mattresses) is
completely different from the
does not have the same
I am sorry if i [sic] seem short in my reply but I am obviously concerned and
these issues have certainly taken the gloss off our
new family purchase. In fact
while staying in Sydney we happened to camp next to a jayco salesman who said
that the leaking issue
should not be happening.
I also emailed David asking the question whether it is normal for the air co to
make a quiet fan noise when turned off? The only
way to stop the nose [sic] is
to turn the mains power off.
I would prefer to deal with my place of purchase and not jayco Canberra as I
have been extremely happy with David and jayco Sydney.
So would appreciate your
advice on how we should move forward in addressing our vans issues.
We love this van and understand that you did not build it. I only wish for these
issues to be addressed.

Consumer TB
Mr Gregorovic stated “I’m just going by the pics supplied and
experience”, and then made the following comments
in the body of
Consumer TB
’s earlier email:
(1) In response to
Consumer TB
concerns about leaking through the hard bed lids, Mr Gregorovic
Without having the van here it’s hard to say exactly, could be gaps in the
silicon under the hinge, could be loose screws on
the lid side of the hinge
where water is coming through, Could be...The hard lid is not 100% water tight,
have a look at where the
locks are and you will see a recess at each lock in the
mould where rain can get through while driving...!
Just going with what I have encountered/experienced and feedback from the
factory in the past.
Without water testing the van and knowing that roof part above the beds being
water proof (unless you can see some holes in it) it’s
the only conclusion
It shouldn’t leak, but there are design constraints that limit how water
tight they are.
(2) In response to
Consumer TB
’s concern that cracks are
considered a standard item, Mr Gregorovic stated –
What I have told you is what I have observed and experienced, also backed up by
the factory themselves in the past.
(3) In response to
Consumer TB
’s concern with a scratch on his
RV, Mr Gregorovic stated –
Only 2 options, repair or leave as is, your call.
(4) In response to
Consumer TB
’s concern with the mattress in
his RV, Mr Gregorovic stated –
Until someone sees it and reports back to the factory I can’t say for sure
if its wrong or not.
(5) In response to
Consumer TB
’s concern about the noise being
made by the air conditioner on his RV, Mr Gregorovic
Doesn’t sound right so I have sent an enquiry to Coast to Coast about this
and will let you know what they come back with.
(6) In response to
Consumer TB
’s stated preference to deal
with Jayco Sydney, rather than an authorised repair agent in Canberra,
Mr Gregorovic stated –
You are welcome to bring it back here if you prefer, you would need to make a
booking with us first, available bookings start from
(7) Finally, in response to
Consumer TB
’s conclusion that he
only wished for the issues with his RV to be addressed, Mr Gregorovic
Can be sorted by us or any other service centre or agent. Please let us know how
you want to proceed.
Consumer TB
responded to Mr Gregorovic, relevantly stating –
Thanks for acknowledging the fact that they should not
be leaking. The reason I was quite concerned was with your initial response
I have spoken with Jayco Canberra and the earliest they can fit us in is on the
July – not an option as the holiday that we have
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that he was concerned that the issues with his RV would
not be addressed before his upcoming three week family
holiday in Queensland,
which he had booked after finding out the date on which he would take delivery
29 May 2013, Mr Gregorovic sent a further email to
Consumer TB
, in which he relevantly stated –
Just an update....
With regards to the air-con issue, Dometic require the van to go to a Dometic
service centre for repairs, possibly faulty PCB..
Because of this we will need the van here for between 2-3 days, the air-con
repair is not a “while you wait” job...
on 29 May 2013,
Consumer TB
replied to Mr Gregorovic,
relevantly as follows –
Thanks for this.
I appreciate your previous email that has given us some hope that maybe there is
a fault with the hard lids and can be fixed.
I am happy to bring the van to you and leave it for a couple of days –
which would give you time to look at the other issues
as well as fix the air co.
I was wondering though if it was possible for you to squeeze us in earlier then
[sic] the 3
as we have had a 3 week holiday booked up in Qld since
we ordered the van and were made aware of the delivery date. I would be happy
leave it there longer if this would allow you to make the repairs sooner.
In your opinion if we repaired the scratch, would there be any imperfections
still on 29 May 2013, Mr Gregorovic replied to
Consumer TB

We had limited time to wet the canvas with the rain in Sydney and then the
weather in Canberra which wouldn’t allow the canvas
to dry and would
remain wet for days. In saying that naturally due to the rain the canvas got
very wet due to the leaking roof. On
the Saturday it was forecast for a sunny
day so I sprayed the canvas at both ends. This resulted in the stitch holes
shrinking. I
would have liked to do this a couple of more times but being in
Canberra doesn’t allow us this flexibility. We intend on spraying
canvas another 2 times before sealing it and aim to do to [sic] in qld on our
holiday in the warmer weather.
Did you have any more thoughts about the scratch
30 May 2013, Mr Gregorovic replied to
Consumer TB
relevantly stating –
service can be done ...
With regards to the scratch, there won’t be any imperfections as in seeing
where the scratch was, but the colour of the gel-coat
in that area will more
than likely be slightly different, a perfect match is impossible because
repairing fibreglass is a different
process to how it was
manufactured.
June 2013 – Jayco Sydney repair works
27 June 2013, ahead of the scheduled service at Jayco Sydney,
Consumer TB
emailed Mr Gregorovic, summarising the issues to be
repaired by Jayco Sydney –
I have listed below the things that need looking at and
repairing while the van is with you from this Saturday - as per our previous
emails. I had someone ring me today confirming the first service but she
wasn’t aware of the van needing warranty fixes.
Seal at front
top - where the pop up pulls down, does not seal. Gap between top of van and the
waterproofing in the ensuite is not complete - sealant has not been applied to
Buttons on both
under seat sliding doors do not operate properly - they get stuck in
continuously has a fan noise even when turned off
Hard lids leak
badly, even when in storage and locked up. When it rains they leak and when it
is being washed they leak
Scratch - I
would prefer to leave as is because I do not want any colour variation
Rear bed has
different density foam/inner spring from front to back - unable to be slept
See you Saturday. I will be driving from Canberra so I
may not be there until after 9.00am.
following day, on 28 June 2013, Mr Gregorovic thanked
Consumer TB
for his email.
Saturday, 29 June 2013,
Consumer TB
left his RV at Jayco
Sydney for repairs to be conducted.
Tuesday, 2 July 2013,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Gregorovic, seeking an update on the repairs to his RV –
Just wondering how things are going with the van?
I was also wondering if you could inspect the cracks in the hard lid as we
previously discussed. They were the ones in each corner
of the top section where
it attaches at the hinge. You had previously said that this is normal but just
wanted your knowledgable
eyes over this.
We want to try and pick the van up on Friday. What would be the earliest that we
could pick it up?
following morning, on 3 July 2013, Mr Gregorovic replied to
Consumer TB
, relevantly stating –
The van is almost complete, I will get the guys to fill
the cracks (cosmetic) on the bed lids, so that they aren’t visible.
The only thing we still need to get done is the air-con, the mobile technician
is coming on Friday morning to check/fix it. Once
he is done I will give you a
call and set a pick-up time with you.
Consumer TB
replied to Mr Gregorovic, to finalise arrangements for picking up his
Do you think we would be safe to say that the air co
would be done by about 3ish?
We are just trying to plan ahead in regards what time to leave Canberra and
thinking it would be best to leave St Mary’s [Jayco
Sydney] before the
Friday afternoon traffic.
5 July 2013,
Consumer TB
collected his RV from Jayco
Sydney. There is relatively limited documentary evidence before the Court in
relation to these repair
works. There is no complete copy of any warranty claim
issued by Jayco Sydney to Jayco Corp. There is, however, a screenshot of what
appears to be part of Jayco Sydney’s digital “Service Control
Centre” record in relation to
Consumer TB’s
screenshot includes an entry for repairs stated to have a “Date In”
and “Date Out” of 29 June 2013,
with a table of partially

July 2013 – trip to Queensland
collecting his RV from Jayco Sydney,
Consumer TB
and his family
travelled to Queensland.
Consumer TB
stated that he encountered
numerous issues with the RV during this trip. He stated that his family did not
use the ensuite because
they were worried about the walls delaminating, that
they did not use the air conditioner because the motor was constantly running,
and that there were ongoing problems with leaking over the bed ends.
Consumer TB
stated that at one point when they were on the Sunshine
Coast, the van was leaking so much that he purchased some plastic and put
in it to try to protect the bed ends from the rain. He stated that his family
got little sleep on the holiday because their
mattresses were soaked, and that
it was not a pleasant experience at all.
8 July 2013, Mr Manning authorised new mattresses to be sent to
Jayco Canberra to be installed on
Consumer TB
’s RV upon his
return home. It appears that this occurred because
Consumer TB
bed ends of the RV, and Mr Gregoroic in turn contacted
Mr Manning for
authorisation to order new mattresses for the RV.
November 2013 – Jayco Canberra repair works
Consumer TB
stated that after Jayco Sydney failed to repair the issues with his RV, he
decided to have further repair works undertaken at Jayco
Canberra, which was
nearer to his home.
Canberra conducted repairs on
Consumer TB
’s RV. There is no
documentary evidence before the Court, such as a copy of any warranty claims
issued by Jayco Canberra to
Jayco Corp, in relation to these repair works.
Consumer TB
stated that by this time, he was very frustrated and
disappointed by the ongoing issues with his RV.
February-March 2014 – correspondence with Jayco Canberra
and Jayco Corp
5 February 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Justin Wright of Jayco Canberra, at the email address
“sales@jaycocanberra.com.au”, which set out
his ongoing concerns
with his RV despite Jayco Sydney and Jayco Canberra’s earlier repair
works, and also raised the prospect
of a significant repair or a replacement RV
I was just wondering if you have received the part for our air co? You may
recall trying to fix it at the end of last year, without
We have also experienced numerous other problems with the van following our most
recent short trip.
The ensuite walls (fake tiling) have come [loose]. Which allows about a 5mm gap
for water penetration around the toilet.
The back bed canvas is also wearing through, there is a hole on the left
The outside toilet door (which I have shown you is now deteriorating and shows
more imperfections.
The inside back floor (near fridge – as shown to you) gets covered in
aluminium shavings and a black dust on every trip. We
have kept one example in a
zipped lock bag as an example and left the dust on the floor. A big problem when
you have a 3 and 5 year
old sleeping and playing just above.
The vinyl pop top that you said that you re-glued was never stuck back into
place. Even when I returned home and inspected the work.
This is the piece that
was holding the wires coming up from cupboard space.
I also need to mention the damage that was caused to the front bottom drop down
bed – exterior. When I picked it up I pointed
out scratch marks that were
not there at drop off. Once home I pulled the bed out and the female mattress
clip was broken and the
mattress was completely removed – not sure why? I
can put the damage down to the female clip being left outside while bed end
pushed back in.
Our bed ends are still leaking profusely when raining. We do not get any sleep
when it is raining as we have to push the canvas up
every 10 minutes to release
the gathering water and stop the pooling. The punctured back bed end canvas has
also allowed water leaking
internally due to the hard lids leaking – not
fun changing wet sheets in the middle of the night especially when it is at the
With everything that has happened to our van with less than 2000km under its
belt I need to know who to talk to in regards to significant
repair and or
replacement. I understand that we did not purchase the van from you but you are
now our repair, service and warranty
agent. When I first spoke to you you were
adamant that our service experience would be better at Jayco Canberra than what
experienced at Sydney.
So far we have had the van in Sydney for 5 days and you have had the van for 2
separate days without any repairs been [sic] made.
If anything more damage has
been incurred while under your care.
I am confused as to why I have not been contacted about the air co issue. We
were left with a van that has an air co fan running
constantly when plugged into
power. The noise at night has been quite annoying for our young kids and has
caused disruption to sleep.
Can you please advise me of my options ASAP as I am not willing to drive the van
any longer with concerns of other issues. We have
had to stop using the shower
due to concerns of water penetration around the toilet which may result in long
lasting issues –
far beyond our 1 year warranty period.
We purchased a new van and spent a lot of money in securing our perfect van.
Unfortunately our new van is far from perfect and could
be described as a
While these are my major concerns there are numerous other issues, ranging from
top cupboard door hinges coming lose [sic] and drools

even after your repair.
This was a purchase that we made that we anticipated would last [us] many years
of holidaying with our kids. If things continue at

Consumer TB
with Mr Manning’s email address.
27 February 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Manning, about his ongoing concerns with his RV, and his dealings with
Jayco Sydney and Jayco Canberra –
I spoke with Barbara [Barrett of Jayco Canberra] on
Monday explaining some real concerns with the service and condition of my van
which I purchased in May of last year.
Since purchasing the van from Sydney Jayco we have experienced various issues
that both Sydney and Canberra Jayco have failed to
address. Please refer to my
email (at the bottom of this email) [being a reference to
Consumer TB
’s email to Jayco Canberra dated
5 February 2014, set out at [
] above] detailing SOME of my major
concerns and the correspondence I have had with Jayco Canberra.
I would appreciate your advice on how we can move forward in addressing these
issues as I am currently paying rego and insurance
on a van that we are unable
to use due to the fear of long lasting issues. This van has been no end of
stress for me as I purchased
a new van so that we could travel as a family for
an extended period of time. If things continue at the current rate I will be
with something completely un-roadworthy and not worth the over $40k that I
spent on it.
While I have typed this email I have heard from Jayco Canberra and have the van
booked in on the 13
March. This is to try and fix the Air co issue
for the third time – constant fan noise when plugged into mains. I have
to them that they need to inspect the other issues so they can fix
them on the 13

Consumer TB

Consumer TB
, and relevantly stated as follows –
Please see [owner’s] email below.
I am not sure what is still to repair out of the list below.
If you need parts; please order them ASAP. Refer to me if you need to so I can
authorise them. For example if a new pop top tent
is needed. Please order. If
the Bed end tents are leaking; please order new bed end tents.
Please quote up the repairs if possible before the booking you have on the
Do you know how much time the van has been off the road exactly for these
problems. Jayco may look at extending the warranty.
Can you please provide me the chassis number so I can make some notes

Consumer TB
Mr Manning, relevantly as follows –
Thanks so much for getting back to me so quickly. For
the first time we feel that things will work out ok.
The chassis number is R49265.
The van was last used over xmas for a whole family holiday but we didn’t
use the ensuite due to the fear of water penetrating
around the toilet. Prior to
xmas we had only used it 3 times as we were concerned that we were making things
worse by simply driving
or using the air co. Wasted van when it is just sitting
in the driveway!
keeping with the tone of that email, during cross-examination,
Consumer TB
accepted that Mr Manning’s email was a proper
and prompt response to his complaint.
28 February 2014,
Consumer TB
telephoned Jayco Canberra to
speak to Mr Lustri to ask if Jayco Canberra could inspect his RV so that
any required parts could be
ordered before his scheduled repairs on
13 March 2014. The Jayco Canberra receptionist told him that
Mr Lustri would telephone him
back, but he did not do so. The same occurred
on 4 March 2014.
on 4 March 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Manning, in which he reiterated his frustration with his RV and his
dealings with Jayco Canberra, and asked Mr
Manning to investigate providing
him with a refund of the money that he paid for the RV –
Thanks again for taking up my concerns so quickly.
Unfortunately when I called jayco Canberra Friday morning (to see if they could
possibly look at my issues prior to my booking date,
allowing time to order
parts) the receptionist said that Roy would call me back that day. Still
didn’t hear anything by this
afternoon so called back and the receptionist
said the parts manager would call back before the end of the day because Roy had
busy training up someone. Again no-one called????
I have had enough as I have not had any positive dealings with jayco, apart from
your email.

I am sick of chasing this up and cannot handle the disappointment and
frustration any more.

done via your selling dealer as they have your sales
contract. I hope it does
not come to that for you.
stated in his affidavit that while he did not recall sending that email, it was
consistent with the fact that he did not
have personal authority to approve
refunds, and that his role was to arrange for a customer’s selling dealer
to assess their
RV and to provide a report, so that he could escalate any
request for a refund to Mr Morgan. During cross-examination,
accepted that his email to
Consumer TB
disclose that if
Consumer TB
requested a refund from Jayco Sydney,
as directed in his email, then Jayco Sydney would confer with Jayco Corp about
the request.
During cross-examination, Mr Manning was challenged on his
evidence that his statement in the email that “I cannot help you
refund” was a reference to his own personal authority, in circumstances
when it would be understood by
Consumer TB
as the position of Jayco
Corp. To that extent, I do not accept Mr Manning’s construction that
his email was limited to a reference
to his own personal authority, as I
consider that a fair objective reading of the email conveys that Mr Manning
was expressing a
position on behalf of Jayco Corp. During cross-examination,
Consumer TB
accepted that this response from Mr Manning, as
with his earlier response to
Consumer TB
, was prompt.
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that after he received Mr Manning’s email, he
of the money that he
paid for the RV.
Consumer JT
did not identify to whom at Jayco
Sydney he spoke on that occasion. He stated that Jayco Sydney told him that he
should contact Jayco
head office, which I treat as a reference to Jayco Corp.
Consumer TB
was not challenged about this evidence in
cross-examination, and for this reason and the fact that it was not implausible,
gave evidence that he was very surprised when he received the copy of
Mr Manning’s email of 5 March 2014, because
Jayco Sydney
had not had much involvement in
Consumer TB
’s enquiries prior
to that point, which had largely been handled by Jayco Canberra. Mr Bilbija
later forwarded Mr Manning’s
email to several of his staff at Jayco
Sydney to ask if they had any information about
Consumer TB
on 5 March,
Consumer TB
replied to Mr Manning, relevantly
as follows –
Thanks again for getting back to me.
Unfortunately the information that has been provided from Navilla [the Jayco
Canberra receptionist] is not accurate. As per usual
I ring her and she attempts
to put me through...no one is available and she then says they will call
back...No one does.
She only responded to me this morning due to the fact that I left a message on
Jayco Canberra’s message bank yesterday after
no one got back to me.
She suggested that someone tried but couldn’t get through – I was
sitting on my phone waiting and phone records would
suggest otherwise. This
seems to be a regular excuse when I call asking for a response.
Sorry it sounds like I am whinging and I guess I am but again today after
actually having a conversation with a new service manager,
he advises me that he
will have to investigate because he doesn’t know the history. I am left
back at square one.
replied, relevantly as follows –
Please keep in touch if this doesn’t get any
action today for you with a booking.
12 March 2014,
Consumer TB
again emailed Mr Manning,
relevantly stating –
Unfortunately it has now been a week since I eventually
made contact with the new service manager at Jayco Canberra. He said that
would have to look at my email and get back to me about all my concerns. I have
not had a phone call.
As suggested in previous emails all I wanted was to get a pre-inspection prior
to my service date (which is tomorrow). If this happened
I would have thought
that jayco could have ordered the necessary parts.
I guess this will mean that my van will be off the road again until they get
Whenever I call the receptionist just jays [sic] they have been extremely busy.
I get that, but this also suggests that their time
is more valuable than my time

day, on 13 March 2014. I note also that there is no reference in
Consumer TB

12 March 2014 to any request that he made to Jayco Sydney at that time
for a refund or
a replacement RV, although I have accepted that he did (see [

20 March 2014, Jayco Canberra produced a warranty claim, which set out
the repair works performed on
Consumer TB
’s RV. The warranty
claim stated that the repair works required a total of 2.10 hours of labour
(inclusive of 0.5 hours attributed
to an administration fee), and the cost was
$157.50 in labour and $12.45 in parts, for a total cost with GST of $186.95. The
claim document included seven line items of repair works, which were
(1) an item which stated “Water Leak” as the
reason, with the description “WARRANTY WORK Fitted foam around bed
hard lid to stop water leak”;
(2) an item which stated “Poor Workmanship” as the reason, with the
description “WARRANTY WORK Aluminum [sic] fragment

warranty claim on 12 June 2014. This can be reconciled with
Mr Morgan’s evidence to which I refer later that he had no
recollection of any dealings with
Consumer TB
on the basis that
warranty claims at a cost below $1,000 were automatically approved. The relevant
fact is that Jayco Corp approved
April to May 2014 – Jayco Canberra repair works
29 April 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Wright, copied to Mr Manning, in which he relevantly stated
Just touching base to find out where we are up to with
the parts that have been ordered for my van.
After my last visit you said it should take about 2 weeks for parts to come in

now been significantly longer

regular updates.

As I have said countless times. This van is a dud and even after all my efforts
of getting things resolved I do not have a result.
I purchased this van in May
2013 with warranty expiring in a couple of days. I have also paid out
significant money for rego and
insurance without being able to use the van with
confidence it will not fall apart.
I have cc’d this email to Peter Manning as I believe it is time for Jayco
to reflect on this situation and come up with a plan
that will address all of
these issues without any further delays, as I am sorry to say, but I do not
believe all of the vans issues
can be fixed to a standard of a new van.
Please get back to me ASAP.
on 29 April 2014,
Consumer TB
sent another email directly
to Mr Manning, stating “please refer to my below email to Jayco
Canberra regarding my caravans
[sic] unresolved issues”, which forwarded a
copy of his earlier email to “sales@jaycocanberra.com.au”, which he
had already copied to Mr Manning. During cross-examination,
Consumer TB
stated that he wanted to involve Mr Manning because
by this time, he had found him quite good to work with. The next day, on
2014, Mr Manning sent an email to the “Jayco
Canberra Service” account directed to Mr Lustri, and copied to
Consumer TB
, in which he relevantly stated –
Please call owner ASAP to inform him about his parts and the A/C problem he has
Please have this one sorted out ASAP. Warranty will not be a problem for the
Jayco manufacturing faults. I worry the A/C may come
up as an issue with the van

further background on the concerns with

which set out the repair works performed on

The warranty claim stated that the repair works required a total of 21.45 hours
of labour (inclusive of 0.5 hours attributed
to an administration fee), and that
the cost was $1,608.75 in labour and $1,509.41 in parts, for a total cost with
GST of $3,429.98.
The warranty claim document included the following line items
of repair works –
(1) an item which stated “Damaged” as the

14 August 2014. Again, this appears likely to
have been a reference to

works, and correspondence with Jayco Corp and Jayco Sydney
Consumer TB
used his RV for a family holiday to
Nelson Bay on the coast of New South Wales. He stated that during this trip,
there were major
water leaks near the ensuite inside the RV, and a loss of power
to one side of the RV, which worried
Consumer TB
, so he decided to
disconnect the water mains.
14 July 2014,
Consumer TB
telephoned Jayco Canberra, and
spoke to the receptionist, Ms Barrett, about the issues occurring with his
RV. On 14 July 2014, Ms
Barrett sent an email to Mr Manning,
in which she relevantly stated –

If you would like to call him his mobile phone number is
stated in his affidavit that while he could no longer recall sending that email,
he should have noted that the junction
Consumer TB
was 12 volts, and not 240 volts, and that the leak would have done no more than
trip the circuit, either by blowing a
fuse or activating a circuit breaker.
Also, Mr Holman stated in his affidavit that the electrical system in
Consumer TB
’s RV was only 12 volts, and that it was not a
safety concern.
forwarded Mr Manning’s email of 14 July 2014 to
Ms Judy Guy, who was a senior advisor employed by Jayco Sydney.
Bilbija stated that he did this so that Ms Guy would telephone
Consumer TB
to ascertain the extent of the issues that he was
experiencing with his RV.
15 July 2014, Jayco Sydney arranged for Mr Chris Dyer of Caravan
Wizard to attend
Consumer TB
’s RV on site at Nelson Bay in
response to the report by
Consumer TB
of a water leak, and an
electrical failure. My Dyer could not replicate the water leak, and in relation
to the electrical failure,
identified some blown fuses. After attending the
site, Mr Dyer sent an email to Ms Guy of Jayco Sydney, with his
assessment of
Consumer TB
As requested I visited mr [TB] today, Tuesday the
of July, at Shoal Bay caravan park [near Nelson Bay] to see what
I could do to help with an internal water leak.
The first task was removing the shower flick mixer mounting panel to inspect the
fittings. There was no obvious sign of water back
there. The 12mm John Guest
hose was pushed into each fitting.
Then the removal of the bathroom basin panel from the toilet unit to inspect the
fitting there. There was no obvious sign of water
there. The John Guest hose was
given a push tighten.
With both panels removed the mains pressure was turned to full volume. Neither
visible fittings were leaking. After 10 minutes of
pressure there was no sign of
Possible that one of the hose fittings was not pushed home 100% and the angle at
which it was sitting caused a leak. When removed
from its position the angle may
not have been present.
Both panels were screwed back into place and areas around inspected for water
after reassembly complete. Neither panels were resealed
as it was made apparent
to myself that the van was going into a workshop for warranty repairs at the end
of this trip in two days
Total time on job 30 minutes.
The second task was testing fuses to discover as to why some 12v items on the
kitchen side were not working and why the 12volt socket
under the lounge was not
working. Two 10a fused [sic] were replaced, problem solved.
Total time on job 6 minutes.
Hope this helps out. Much of a non event but at least the customer could
continue their holiday with full use of their van.
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that around this time he telephoned Jayco Sydney and
again requested either a replacement RV or a refund
of the money that he paid
for his RV. In his affidavit,
Consumer TB
stated that he thought he
spoke to Mr Holman. An email from Ms Guy to Mr Bilbija sent on
22 July 2014, referred to at [

Consumer TB

refund or replacement RV, but the email also supports an inference that at about
time there was more than one request by

is conflicting evidence about the alleged conversation between
Consumer TB
and Mr Holman at around this time.
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that he spoke to Mr Holman,
and that Mr Holman, on behalf of Jayco Sydney, “just said
to his request for a refund or replacement, and said
that that the decision had to be made by Jayco Corp.
Consumer TB
also stated that Mr Holman only offered further repairs on his RV, and said
that Jayco Corp senior management had offered to pay
for the RV to be
transported to the Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong for those repairs to be

stated that at the conclusion of this
conversation, he arranged to take his van to Jayco Sydney for an assessment. In
response, Mr
Holman stated that he did not recall speaking to
Consumer TB
at this time, and that he did not believe that he
Consumer TB
that he would not receive a refund or replacement RV.
Mr Holman stated that he would not have given that advice because he did
have authority to approve or deny a customer’s request for a refund or
replacement, and because Jayco Sydney and Jayco Corp’s
practice was to
require RVs to be brought in for assessment before any decision about a refund
or replacement was made. Mr Holman
stated that he recalled various
conversations with
Consumer TB
in which he made statements to that
effect. During cross-examination, Mr Holman was challenged on this
evidence, and he affirmed
his evidence that he did not recall this alleged
conversation with
Consumer TB
accept Mr Holman’s evidence that it was unlikely that he would in an
unqualified way reject
Consumer TB
’s request for a refund or
replacement RV at this time. Having regard to all the circumstances, I consider
it more likely that
Mr Holman would not have refused
Consumer TB
’s request for a refund or replacement without
assessing the RV, which makes common and commercial sense. When this proposition
Consumer TB
in cross-examination, he said that he could
not comment. Furthermore,
Consumer TB
’s reference in his
affidavit to Mr Holman stating that senior management had offered to pay
for the RV to be transported to
Melbourne for further repairs suggests that any
such conversation occurred after Jayco Sydney had assessed the RV, and after
Corp had offered to effect repairs in Melbourne.
22 July 2014, Ms Guy sent an email to Mr Bilbija, in
relation to
Consumer TB
’s ongoing concerns with his RV, his
demand for a refund or replacement RV, and arrangements for further repairs at
Jayco Sydney
I spoke to [
Consumer TB
] this morning in regard
to bringing his van back for assessment of repairs already carried out on his
van and moving on to have these
items repaired.
He hasn’t changed his stance from previously when he wanted either a
replacement van or a refund.
He would rather bring his van to us personally rather than have it picked up so
I have booked him on the Monday 4

stated in his affidavit that after receiving that email, he formed the view that
Consumer TB
brought his RV up to Jayco Sydney, Mr Holman
could handle the matter.
July 2014 – further Jayco Canberra warranty claim
on 23 July 2014, Jayco Canberra produced a warranty claim, which set
out only one line item of repair work on
Consumer TB
which stated “Faulty” as the reason, with the description
“Mattress too high, Authorized by Peter Manning.
Invoice attached”,
for a total cost of $422.40 with GST, being the cost of the parts with no labour
cost. It appears that this
claim may have duplicated item 8 of Jayco
Canberra’s earlier warranty claim dated 26 June 2014, which was
also for the replacement
of a mattress that was “too high” (see [
] above). Nonetheless, the document
records that Jayco Corp approved this warranty claim on
14 August 2014.
August 2014 – Jayco Sydney repair works
4 August 2014,
Consumer TB
took his RV to Jayco Sydney for
an assessment of further repair works. Mr Holman met
Consumer TB
and assessed the RV. Mr Holman stated in his
affidavit that he considered that previous repairs conducted on the RV were
poor, which
in context I take to be limited to a reference to the quality of
repairs to the fibreglass.
5 August 2014, Ms Guy sent an email to Mr Manning, copied to
Mr Holman, in relation to the issues with
Consumer TB

who prepared the quotation, stated in his affidavit that with the exception of
the leak, none of the concerns noted in
the email rendered the van unable to be
used, and that he considered that all of the concerns were minor and capable of
easy repair.
During cross-examination, Mr Holman accepted that $5,000 for a
repair was a high and substantial dollar figure, and that a repair
that cost in
excess of $5,000 was a major repair. Mr Holman also accepted that at this
Consumer TB
’s RV had already been the subject of
warranty repairs on nine occasions, and that there were still a number of
unresolved issues
Consumer TB
’s RV including leaking
stated in his affidavit that after reviewing Mr Holman’s quotation
and the photographs attached to those emails,
he formed the view that the issues
Consumer TB
’s RV were the result of poor workmanship and
customer service failings by Jayco Canberra, rather than a manufacturing fault
of any significance. During cross-examination, Mr Manning accepted that a
cost of in excess of $5,000 was a fairly significant amount
for repair works. By
contrast, during cross-examination, Mr Bilbija disputed that a $5,000
repair was fairly major, and instead characterised
a $5,000 repair as
“fixable”, and stated that a repair of half the value of the RV,
maybe $10,000 or $15,000, would be
a large repair. In response to
Mr Holman’s evidence that a $5,000 repair was a major repair,
Mr Bilbija stated that while he
trusted Mr Holman’s judgment and
from time to time he relied upon Mr Holman’s opinion as to whether or
not something
was a major repair, he nonetheless had a different opinion as to
what constituted a large repair.
on 5 August 2014, Mr Holman sent an email to Mr Manning, in
which he requested the history of warranty claim repair works conducted
Consumer TB
’s RV. Mr Manning replied the following day,
on 6 August 2014, by forwarding a copy of the warranty claim repair
works recorded
in the Jayco Corp computer system, which I note did not include
records of all of the repair works referred to above. Mr Holman stated
he reviewed the list and formed the view that most of the items were extremely
small and cosmetic, and could be easily and cheaply
repaired, with such repairs
ordinarily taking place as part of a general service. Mr Holman stated that
the only item of more significance
was the water leak from the canvas, although
the list indicated that it could not be verified on testing. I infer that
was a reference
to the line item in the warranty claim for the repair works
conducted by Jayco Canberra in mid-2014 referred to at [
] above, with description
“CUSTOMER CLAIMS THERE IS WATER LEAK FORM [sic] CANVAS, WATER TEST NO LEAK
6 August 2014, Mr Manning sent an email to Mr Holman, in
which he relevantly stated –
Can you please email a list of every thing you know
needs fixing on this van. Please supply list ASAP.
We may be doing the repairs down here and I need to run it past Phil [Rigby] for
how long it will be needed down here for.

stated that his overall impression was that the majority of the issues were
minor repairs that would ordinarily be picked
up during a regular service, and
which many customers would not report. Mr Holman stated that, for example,
the cracks on the underside
of the bed lids were a purely cosmetic issue of
paint cracking on top of the timber rails of the frame, and that most water
were actually a minor repair. Mr Holman stated that the leak in
Consumer TB
’s van could have been caused by pipe damage during
the previous shower wall repairs, rather than a manufacturing issue.
Bilbija stated that he considered that those repairs could be conducted
fairly quickly.
on 7 August 2014, Mr Manning replied to Mr Holman, copied to
Mr Rigby and Mr Dean Moyle of Jayco Corp, to make arrangements
Jayco Corp to perform the repairs to the listed issues with
Consumer TB
Please contact Phil [Rigby] to book it in down here and

Phil will need to order new hard lids and shower walls. Please do this ASAP so
he can organise parts.

on 7 August 2014,
Consumer TB

Mr Manning, copied to Mr Holman, in which he relevantly
Please find attached a document detailing most
correspondence with Jayco Canberra, Jayco Sydney and yourself Peter. I am
not able to attach the records of verbal conversation, and the more
recent conversations highlight the most recent issues - being;
scratch on the
side of van and the way it has been repaired; ensuite issues - including
electrical failings and leaking issues.
This document is 32 pages long. I have done my best to illustrate all emails I
have sent and received from all parties.
Peter - As I said to you on the phone recently, the only action that I have
received from Canberra was following an email from you,
which I have
appreciated. Unfortunately the action taken was not appropriate and caused other
Jason - You and Sydney have acted promptly since my most recent complaint and
that is also appreciated.
I will not accept the decision to send this van back to Melbourne for repairs.
This van has been only used approximately 4 times
(never off road) in 15 months.
In that time it has been back to Sydney for a week and in and out of Canberra 4
times with the last
repairs taking 2 months. Minimal issues have been resolved.
Now it is has been suggested that the van will return to Melbourne in
and back in October- further time of [sic] the road?
I did not pay over $40000 for a van that we cannot use, have not been able to
use (to its full potential or for the time we wanted)
and on top of all of this,
continue to pay rego and insurance.
This is my second Jayco. My parents have the 14 foot expanda. My Sister has
16.49.3 expanda (same model as our van) and my parents
in law have a Stirling.
These vans have had no problems and been used a great deal more frequently than
I am sure that Jayco pride themselves on their good reputation, quality product
and service. On this occasion I have purchased a
van that has not performed in
the way that it was described as been [sic] able to perform. We have a damaged
caravan with no way
of knowing if these issues will return in years to come. If
we were wanting to sell this van, we would not get near the value it

I stand by my position that this van needs to be replaced as soon as

email attached a 32 page document which set out
Consumer TB
earlier email correspondence with Jayco Sydney and Jayco Canberra in relation to
the issues with his RV.
29 minutes later, Mr Manning replied to
Consumer TB
, copied to
Mr Holman, relevantly as follows –
I have checked with senior management again on your
case. They say this is their only offer which is to bring the van down to the
factory to have repairs done as explained to you by Jason Holman.
We have also extended the Jayco warranty out by 6 months as a goodwill gesture.
Just so you know this does not include any third
party warranties such as the
A/C or fridge etc.
Please confirm with Jason that you agree to send the van to head office as Jason
will need to organise the transport down and back
up with the work shop here.
Please do this ASAP.
cross-examination, Mr Manning gave evidence that he could not recall or
explain why on this occasion he escalated
Consumer TB
request to Jayco Corp senior management, being Mr Austin or Mr Morgan,
rather than following his previous position of referring
Consumer TB
that he believed that within the period between him receiving
Consumer TB
’s email, including the attachment setting out
32 pages of correspondence, and sending his response about 29 minutes
he would have consulted Mr Austin or Mr Morgan, who decided not
to authorise the replacement of
Consumer TB
’s RV. When further
questioned in cross-examination, including by reference to
Mr Austin’s statement on 14 August 2014
that he was not
aware of the background of
Consumer TB
’s case, referred to at
] below, Mr Manning stated
that it was likely that during that period, he printed a copy of
Consumer TB
’s correspondence and conferred with Mr Morgan
in his office about the appropriate response, explaining that
Mr Morgan’s
office was only two away from his own. Mr Manning
rejected the propositions that he did not, in fact, escalate
Consumer TB
’s request to Jayco Corp senior management, and
that the reason he did not do so was because he knew that Jayco Corp would only
offer to repair
Consumer TB
’s RV. Mr Manning stated,
“This decision came from someone, it didn’t come directly from
me”. Mr Morgan, who
was called before Mr Manning, did not give
evidence about any conversation with Mr Manning concerning
Consumer TB
’s request, and was not cross-examined on that
topic by senior counsel for the ACCC. I accept Mr Manning’s evidence
he likely discussed
Consumer TB
’s request with
Mr Morgan, because there is no sufficient objective reason to disbelieve
that evidence, and for the further
reason that the ACCC did not submit that
Mr Manning’s evidence on this issue should not be accepted.
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that he was really disappointed and frustrated by
Mr Manning’s email, from which he understood Jayco
Corp would only
offer repairs, and would not provide him with a replacement RV in any
circumstances. Later on 7 August 2014,
Consumer TB
to Mr Manning, copied to Mr Holman, relevantly as
I doubt that senior management have had the opportunity
to read the details of my complaints and emails when they were only sent this
This is not acceptable.
An extension of 6 months in warranty is no gesture of good will when we
don’t even have the van to use during the extension
of warranty and
couldn’t use it at all during the first extension of warranty because it
was with Jayco Canberra. Then to suggest
that it does not extend to AC etc -
when the AC has not worked since the day it was delivered.
Peter you said during our last phone call that it [is] not your decision or
senior management’s decision about whether the
van would be replaced. It
was in your words ‘the point of sale’ responsibility - Sydney? Has
this changed since our conversation?
Can you please pass on contact details of a senior manager as this is not a fair
outcome for the immense stress it has caused and
the product that we are left
cross-examination, Mr Manning accepted that it was likely that he had
previously made a statement to
Consumer TB
to the effect alleged in
the second last paragraph of the above email – that it was not Jayco Corp
management’s decision
whether to replace an RV and that it was the selling
dealer’s responsibility. I accept that evidence, and I find that it is
likely that Mr Manning informed
Consumer TB
that the decision
was one for the selling dealer in his conversation with him on
14 July 2014, to which I referred at [
] above. Mr Manning also accepted in
cross-examination that the statement was incomplete because the selling dealer
would take up
any replacement request with Jayco Corp. That acceptance is of
little moment, because it was the subject of a subsequent email that
Mr Manning sent to
Consumer TB,
to which I refer next.
still on 7 August 2014, Mr Manning replied to
Consumer TB
, copied to Mr Bilbija of Jayco Sydney, relevantly
Yes you would normally have to take this up with your
selling dealer in regards to a refund or replacement van first. They will talk
to senior management here about that though. Senior management have discussed
your case with me after I told them what your emails
were about. They do not
deem the repairs to be major.
Unfortunately Jayco does not control the third parties so their warranties will
stand as they are.
Please note that all repairs whether Jayco or one of the third parties carry 12
months warranty on the fault fixed at the time from
its completion date. If you
would like to take further I would recommend your selling dealer (Jayco Sydney:
Tyrone) or emailing customer.relations@jayco.com.au
11 August 2014, Mr Manning sent an email to Mr Bilbija and
Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney, in which he relevantly

is Sydney with that?

As per our conversation. The owner is wanting a new van.
As you can see by my last email, I have been looking into his history, I
present my findings to Tyrone [Bilbija] and we will contact
replied to Mr Holman, “No probs.”
next day, on 13 August 2014, Mr Holman sent an email to
Consumer TB
, copied to Mr Manning and Mr Bilbija, in which
he relevantly stated –
As per my previous email, I have looked at the service
history in regards to your van Chassis Number R49265.
I confirm that your van is repairable, in our opinion the repairs are not deemed
to be major and does not substantiate your request
for a replacement van.
Jayco Corporation Pty Ltd agrees with our findings and they are willing to
provide the following at no cost to you.
* Transport your van - Chassis Number R49265 to
and from Melbourne to complete repairs.
* Jayco Corporation have also confirmed that they will honour a further
6 month warranty (appliances excluded) on your van once they
have returned
I formally ask for your approval that we can release the
van to Jayco Corporation Pty Ltd in Melbourne for repairs to be completed.
I await your approval so that I can move ahead with the repairs required on your
gave evidence that the position that he expressed in that email was a joint
position of both Jayco Sydney and Jayco Corp.
Mr Holman agreed to a
proposition that he was instructed by Mr Manning that because the RV was
repairable, the repairs were not deemed
to be major, and therefore that Jayco
Corp was not willing to replace the RV. The terms of the cross-examination are
important, and
the relevant questions and answers were as
Q: Now, in that email that you sent to Mr [TB], you
informed him that the van was repairable and that in your opinion the repairs,
or in our opinion you expressed the repairs are not deemed to be major and does
not substantiate your request for a replacement van.
Do you see that?
Q: You used the right phrase, “our opinion”. You see that?
Q: And that was your opinion, and it was also the opinion, wasn’t it, of
Mr Manning from Jayco Corp?
A: It was an opinion from Jayco Corp and myself. Yes.
Q: Okay. So it was a joint opinion?
Q: And I think you said earlier that it was your practice, if instructed by
Jayco Corp to repair, that’s what you would do?
Q: Do you understand that that’s what you were doing here? You had been
instructed by Mr Manning at Jayco Corp that the repairs
– that because the
van was repairable the repairs were not deemed to be major, and therefore Jayco
Corp were not willing to
process Mr [TB]’s request for a replacement
read, the cross-examination was directed to instructions given by
Mr Manning to Mr Holman in relation to Jayco Corp’s
warranty obligations, and Jayco Corp’s position that it would not process
the request for a replacement RV. The cross-examination
has to be evaluated with
other evidence, including the emails of Mr Manning to which I have referred
above, where he sought to know
what Jayco Sydney’s attitude was towards
the request for a replacement RV.
prepared the email to
Consumer TB
of 13 August 2014 with
assistance from Mr Morgan of Jayco Corp. Mr Holman sent a draft of the
email to Mr Morgan for his review,
and Mr Morgan responded with
comments and suggestions, which were limited to changes in the language of the
email that did not affect
its substance. This assistance was characterised by
Mr Morgan as giving advice to a former colleague with whom he had worked at
Jayco Corp factory, who had only recently commenced at Jayco Sydney in a
customer-facing role. Mr Morgan denied that this was an
instance of
Mr Holman seeking approval, or escalating the issue to Mr Morgan, in
accordance with some procedure that had to be followed
by dealers.
Mr Holman stated in his affidavit that he no longer recalled what prompted
him to send the draft email to Mr Morgan,
but that at the time he had not
been working at Jayco Sydney for long, and that it was likely that he sought
guidance as to how to
communicate Jayco Corp’s decision regarding the
request for a refund or a replacement RV. Mr Holman was not cross-examined
that he was seeking approval, or escalating the issue
to Mr Morgan pursuant
to some procedure that he had to follow. The terms of the emails themselves
support a finding that Mr Holman
was seeking assistance in relation to the
drafting. In the result, I accept the evidence of Mr Morgan that
Mr Holman sought his advice
as to the drafting of the email, and not as
part of some approval procedure that dealers had to follow.
stated in his affidavit that the substance of this response to
Consumer TB
was agreed between himself and Mr Holman of Jayco
Sydney, and Messrs Murphy, Austin, and Morgan of Jayco Corp. The source of
statement appears to be Mr Morgan’s email to him and
Mr Holman dated 13 August 2014 containing the settled version of
Consumer TB.
That email was also copied to
Mr Austin, Mr Manning, and Mr Murphy.
stated that he involved Jayco Corp in the process because Jayco Corp had been
involved when the initial issues with
Consumer TB
raised with Jayco Canberra. I am not persuaded that Mr Bilbija himself sent
any direct communications to Jayco Corp
in relation to
Consumer TB
as his affidavit evidence might suggest. Rather, he appears to have left the
correspondence to Ms Guy and Mr Holman, although he
was copied into
the significant email correspondence.
cross-examination, Mr Bilbija rejected the proposition that he and Jayco
Sydney did not independently consider whether to replace
Consumer TB
’s RV, and that Jayco Sydney was hamstrung by
whether Jayco Corp would reimburse any refund or replacement RV provided to
Consumer TB
Q: And I want to suggest to you one last time,
Mr Bilbija, that whilst you might have considered that you were undertaking
consideration process that involved whether or not Jayco Corp would
– had agreed to repair a recreational vehicle, you were,
in reality,
hamstrung by whether or not you thought Jayco Corp would reimburse you if you
were to provide a refund or replacement
and Jayco Corp thought that the van
should be repaired, and refused to indemnify you?
Q: That never factored into your consideration at all? Is that your
accept Mr Bilbija’s evidence, as set out above. In relation to
Consumer TB
’s RV specifically, I have noted that
Mr Bilbija was copied into the relevant email correspondence relating to
Consumer TB
and might therefore be taken to have adopted what was
proposed, namely that
Consumer TB
’s RV would be repaired at
the Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong, and no refund or replacement provided. That
finding follows
from more general findings that I have made elsewhere about
Mr Bilbija and Jayco Sydney’s dealings with Jayco Corp. More
I find that Mr Bilbija did not allow his decisions on refund or
replacement requests to be hamstrung by whether Jayco Corp thought
an RV should
instead be repaired. However, I find that Mr Bilbija’s decisions were
liable to be influenced by Jayco Corp’s
own views about such matters,
which was a natural result of a consultation process. But as I discuss later in
these reasons, the
evidence supports the conclusion that Mr Bilbija
understood that Jayco Sydney as the supplier had a liability under the ACL that
was separate from Jayco Corp’s manufacturer’s liability, and that in
some instances he had been prepared to act independently
of Jayco Corp in
providing a refund or replacement RV to a consumer. These findings are made in
the context of my rejection of the
ACCC’s claim that there existed a
procedure under which dealers were required to seek Jayco Corp’s approval
before agreeing
to provide a refund, or a replacement RV.
on 13 August 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Manning, Mr Bilbija, and Mr Holman, in which he relevantly
At this point, I am left with no other option but to
refer this to the Department of Fair Trading and Ombudsman.
I am very interested to hear that you do not deem a leaking van that caused
power faults not serious. I am also very concerned that

the whole sidewall of the van off, to replace the wall that is scratched not

What compensation does Jayco extend to people that have major defects from date
of purchase that causes a product to be off the road
for extended periods?
I will also be contacting my insurance and registration companies to put a hold

something that I
can’t use. Can you confirm that your insurance covers the van while in

Q; If you were selling this 2013 Jayco Expanda (second hand), what would you

Q; What would be your response? Do you lie or tell the truth?
A; (Truth - 32 pages of correspondence between the owner and Jayco listing

response to that email, Mr Holman stated in his affidavit that he never
Consumer TB
that the wall of his van would have to be taken
off, but rather that at one point he told
Consumer TB
a wall needed to be taken off, he could do that with no problem as it was
not a large job. Mr Manning stated that he did not consider
that removing
and replacing the side wall of an RV was serious, and that while it might be
time consuming, it required no more than
removing some components and an
adjustment, which could be done by a dealer or service agent.
still on 13 August 2014, Mr Holman sent an email to
Mr Manning, copied to Mr Bilbija, to provide further information in
Consumer TB
Just a few things to clarify.
* I have attached an email from Chris Dyer -
Caravan Wizard - that explains that there was 2 fuses blown in the van when
to Shoal Bay.
* I stated when he was asking about how to repair the scratch on the side
of his van that ‘‘the repairers at Jayco Melbourne
are fantastic and
that they would be able to fix it with no problem at all and that if the wall
was un-repairable, which it is not,
that the walls are easy to replace”. I
did not state that his wall would have to be replaced.
* Judy [Guy] offered him to transport his van back to Jayco Sydney for
inspection, at no cost to him, and he stated that he would
rather bring his van
to us personally.

I haven’t been involved until now so I
haven’t yet seen or read all the correspondence. I note that Peter has
lot of these items in Mr [TB]’s folder in the Y drive.
I recommend you discuss it with Peter Murphy, it boils down to 1: toughing it
out through Fair Trading (I don’t know enough
to assess how strong or weak
our case would be) OR 2: offering a rebuild van on the usual terms eg he
collects it from Jayco and
delivers his current van to us at the same
18 August 2014, Mr Holman sent an email to

Thank you for informing us on your decision to not move forward with repairs to
your van chassis number R49265.
In regards to your question on insurance, I have contacted our Insurance company

In regards to your question about costs being covered for transport from ACT to
Sydney on the 04/08/14, I believe our Service Advisor

August to September 2014 – Jayco Sydney repair
August 2014, Mr Holman conducted further repair works to try to
identify and fix the leak inside
Consumer TB
19 August 2014, Mr Holman sent an email to
Consumer TB
, seeking further information on the nature of the leak
in the RV –
I have had the opportunity yesterday to connect your van
to mains pressure to determine the cause of the water leak.
The van was connected for 6 hrs, I checked on it every hour or so, walked around
inside the van, but I can’t find any leak.
I have the email from the repairer that visited you onsite in Shoal Bay [near
Nelson Bay], it states that he had the van connected
for 10 mins and could not
find the leak also.
Can you provide me with some background information please, so I can replicate
the scenario for when it happened.
on 19 August 2014,
Consumer TB
replied to Mr Holman,
providing the background on the leak in his RV –
As discussed when [I] dropped the van off to you.
We arrived at Nelson Bay and plugged the van in to mains water. Later that night
I noticed water beading around floor trim. Throughout
the night the leak was
significant enough to cause pooling near the table. The caravan was level
although the water was notices [sic]
all the way from the fridge end, stopping
in front of the power control box under lounge. While preparing food for dinner
some lighting being out on that side of the van. I disconnected the
water mains.
The next morning (after clean up) I decided to reconnect the mains and not use
any taps within the caravan. The same issue started
within a couple of hours.
Jayco Sydney organised the repairer to come out for the inspection and hopeful
repair. He was unable to
see any obvious issues and left after a period of time.
I believe this was longer than 10 minutes after reconnecting mains. He had
the electrical problems and replaced fuses - no pwer [sic] to down lights and 12
volt plugs? We left the van for the day and
returned later that evening to have
the same water issue on the floor.
I have attached two photos that were taken after the repairer had pulled the
ensuite apart.
Hope this helps.

Consumer TB
still on 19 August 2014,
Consumer TB
again emailed
Mr Holman, with further guidance –
The only other thing that was connected (to replicate
the scenario) was that it was connected to mains power and the electric hot
water service was switched on.

That’s all I can think of.

I have had Mr [TB]’s expanda pop, R49265, on
water test for the past week. I have noticed a drip coming from the rear
of the van.
I have proceeded to pull forward the top basin/vanity and have found that there
was a pipe which has a split in it just behind the
wall. I have had the pipe
repaired and the unit tested, all is ok.

Consumer TB

Thank you for email in regards to the water leak within
your van, R49265.
Over the past 2 weeks, I have been testing the van to try and replicate the
scenario for when it was leaking. I have finally been
able to get your van to
leak and found the issue.
The high pressure pipe behind the ensuite vanity had a crack in it. I was able
to remove the affected part and re-connected the pipe
currently been tested under pressure for 18 hours thus far and I am very
confident that this was the issue.
I have had the vanity installed and sealed,
Thank you once again for helping me in regards to rectifying this

August to September – Fair Trading complaint and
correspondence
Consumer TB
made a complaint to New South Wales Fair Trading on 22 August 2014 by

Correspondence
recent correspondence
stated, the email attached three documents. The second and third documents
extracted the correspondence between
Consumer TB
and Jayco Corp,
Jayco Sydney, and Jayco Canberra, set out above. The first document was a
two-page typewritten letter which stated
I am writing for your assistance in regards to the
purchase of a new Jayco Expanda in May 2013. The van was purchased from Jayco
and we have had overwhelming issues with this van since the date of
purchase. The faults have meant that we have been unable to use
the caravan to
its full potential and for a significant period of time, not been able to
utilise the caravan at all. This caravan
was purchased for over $40,000.00 and
we continue to pay for registration and insurance for a caravan that is off the
The caravan has been back to two service agents, Jayco Sydney and Jayco
Canberra, with little to no issues resolved.
Initially the caravan was returned to Jayco Sydney to have the following repairs
made - 1 week in duration;
Seal at front top - where the pop up pulls
down, does not seal. Gap between top of van and the seal.
The waterproofing in the ensuite is not complete – sealant has not
been applied to some areas
Buttons on both under seat sliding doors do not operate properly - they get
Air co continuously has a fan noise even when turned off
Hard lids leak badly, even when in storage and locked up. When it rains
they leak and when it is being washed they leak
Rear bed has different density foam/inner spring from front to back -
unable to be slept on.
When we returned to collect the caravan none of these
issues had been addressed to the point the service manager was trying to correct
the leaking bed ends with silicon -while we waited. It was no surprise that this
did not resolve the leaking bed ends.
Due to the unsuccessful attempt by Jayco Sydney to repair faults and after
advice from the service manager Jayco Sydney, I opted
to take the van to Jayco
Canberra. I have since had the van at Jayco Canberra four times. The last time
was for 2 months, again with
little faults addressed. The following needed to be
repaired due to further and ongoing issues;
Ensuite walls delaminating – whole
ensuite to be replaced
Back bed end canvas wearing to the point of a hole causing leaking bed -
whole canvas bed end to be replaced.
Outside toilet door continues to deteriorate - to be replaced
Air co issue
The inside back floor (near fridge) gets covered in aluminium shavings and
a black dust on every trip. We have kept one example in
a zipped lock bag as an
example and left the dust on the floor
The vinyl pop top was never stuck back into place. This is the piece that
is holding the wires coming up from cupboard space.
Damage that was caused to the front bottom drop down bed - exterior. When I
picked it up I pointed out scratch, marks that were not
there at drop off? Once
mattress was completely removed
– not sure why? I can put the damage down
to the female clip being left outside while bed end was pushed back in.
Our bed ends are still leaking profusely when raining. We do not get any
sleep when it is raining as we have to push the canvas up
every 10 minutes to
release the gathering water and stop the pooling. The punctured back bed end
canvas has also allowed water leaking
internally due to the hard lids leaking -
not fun changing wet sheets in the middle of the night especially when it is at
The faults that were addressed were the air conditioner,
the side toilet door, [punctured] bed end and the walls delaminating in the
ensuite. Unfortunately the ensuite fix generated more issues and was not
replaced as first instructed. The vinyl pop top was also
meant to be replaced
although only the section that was ripped was replaced - the stitching holes are
too large and now let rain
in. The other issue that was attempted to be fixed
was the external scratch. This also was not resolved but only made worse. The
small scratch is now a large section of the van showing scratches (deep buffing
dullness), paint runs and orange peel effect.
The ensuite work has caused a leaking ensuite with water leaking on to the floor
of the van. Jayco Sydney sent a repair agent to
the caravan park that we were
staying at and pulled the ensuite apart. There was no obvious sign of leak but
the residual issue was
power outages caused by the water to the right hand side
of the van. The repair agent could not determine any faults although replaced
fuses that had blown due to the water leaks.
Due to all of the above faults, the ongoing nature of the faults and the fact
that the value of this van is now compromised, I have
requested a re-placement
caravan or my money back. Jayco Sydney and area manager of Jayco do not support
my request. Saying that
all issues can be repaired. They would like my consent
for the caravan to be sent back to Melbourne for repairs. The van would be
other compensation offered apart from an extension
of warranty by 6 months,
although this does not extend to the appliances - Air conditioner being one of
the major long lasting issues.
I have attached most correspondence I have had with Jayco Canberra, Jayco Sydney
and the area manager.
I have also not approved my caravan being sent to Melbourne until I have
received advice from Fair Trading.
This situation has caused a great deal of stress for me and my family. I
appreciate your time in investigating my situation.
Please do not hesitate to call for additional
information.
1 September 2014, the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading sent an
Consumer TB
, which relevantly stated –
I refer to your correspondence received
22 August 2014 regarding your issue with Jayco Sydney.
As discussed NSW Fair Trading requires further information in order to address
the issues you have raised. Accordingly, could you

Jayco explained that they would

big and cause rain to come in to the van.
I appreciate you taking the time to investigate my
situation. I would appreciate you taking the time to read the original

of ongoing issues that we have experienced with this van. My
major concern is
that most of these defects/issues have left me with a van [that] would be very
difficult to sell on the second hand
market and would reduce its value
significantly.
email attached a copy of the receipt issued by Jayco Sydney to
Consumer TB
for the purchase of his RV, and a copy of
Consumer TB
’s letter outlining his complaint to New South
Wales Fair Trading as sent on 22 August 2014 and set out at [
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that he also spoke to a representative of New South
Wales Fair Trading by telephone.
Consumer TB
stated that he was told
that the Office had been in contact with Mr Manning about his complaint,
and because Jayco Corp had offered
to repair his van at its factory in
Dandenong, he could not get a refund.
Consumer TB
stated that after
receiving that advice, he agreed for his van to be repaired at the Jayco Corp
factory in Dandenong. The basis for
that advice, and whether it was reasonable
are not issues in this proceeding.
September to November 2014 – Jayco Corp Dandenong factory
repair works
15 September 2015,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Holman, in which he authorised repairs to be conducted on his RV at the
Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong –
I am writing agreeing to the transportation of my
caravan to Melbourne for repair work repairing faults as listed below.
* scratch and damage caused, after attempted repair from Canberra, to outside
wall of caravan - door side. To the left of the door
and the right. Large
section on left and a small 10cm patch on the right – quite obvious in the
right light.
* pop top vinyl skirt where wires come up, ripped due to congestion of wires. A
small section was replaced but stitching holes allow
rain to penetrate.
* after ensuite leak - water damage to be addressed
* Front and back bed ends still leaking. From hard lids to canvas. Canberra
attempted to fix but put things in place that did not
address the issue - foam
stripping around seal when lid is closed?
* aluminium shavings and wearing of luggage area under mattress, where it meets
fridge wall - I think you took photos of this Jason?
* hinges on draws [sic] and doors coming lose. Screw on hinge to the cupboard on
the top left as you walk in - constantly coming
away. If tightened any more it
will penetrate other side
* dis-colourisation of sink in ensuite from sun coming from sunlight, door seems
to be changing colour and overall dullness of van.
I am concerned that this was
made worse while not covered in jayco Canberra, sydney and then also
* back mattress has been replaced but it is still unable to be slept on due to
the unevenness of it where it folds.
* when the pop top is down the seal at the front does not seal
An issue that I have not previously highlighted I guess because there were other
issues that were prioritised. It would be great
if this could be investigated
while in Melbourne.
* paint work around top inside steal strip. Just below where the pop top starts.
In each corner the paint work was not completed
and some overspray evident on
wood panelling.
Also, at one of our park stays a neighbour (with his fishing rod) scratched one
of the large green decals on the side of the van.
Is it possible to have this
One of my main concerns with the current state of my van is the overall impact
on its resale value. So as we discussed this morning,
I was wondering if I could
be provided with details about how the van will be repaired while in Melbourne.
I would appreciate this
prior to any work commencing.
I will read through all the correspondence that I have had to ensure I have
covered everything. I will get back to you ASAP if I
have missed anything.
Thanks again Jason.
Consumer TB
stated that shortly after he sent that email on 15 September 2014, he
spoke to Mr Holman by telephone, who advised him that his RV
was booked in
for repairs at the Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong on 23 October 2014.
Consumer TB
’s RV was transported to Melbourne shortly after
this email was sent on 15 September 2014, and it was returned to
Consumer TB
at Jayco Sydney on about 21 November 2014,
approximately 9 weeks later. Mr Holman gave evidence about the list of
items to be repaired
Consumer TB
set out in this email.
Mr Holman stated that the list included issues that had not previously been
raised with Jayco Sydney, including
the aluminium shavings and wearing of the
luggage area under the mattress, the discolouring of the sink in the ensuite,
and the front
seal failing when the pop top was down. Mr Holman also stated
that the paint overspray issue was extremely minor and cosmetic, and
issue was a goodwill repair.
next day, on 16 September 2014, Mr Holman forwarded a copy of
Consumer TB
’s email to Mr Rigby, copied to
Mr Bilbija, Mr Austin, and Mr Morgan, and relevantly
As per our discussion yesterday, the information on
repairs required to this van R49265, are stated in below email from
Please inform me of dates for transport, workshop times and estimated return
The customer has asked to be informed of how the repairs will be taken out on
the van. I have suggested that communication of this
will be presented once the
unit has been inspected at the factory.
Any issues, please let me know.
24 October 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Holman, in which he relevantly stated –
By memory, I believe that our van was due to be sent
will get back to us detailing repairs that will be carried
30 October 2014, Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney sent an email to
Mr Rigby of Jayco Corp, outlining the issues with
Consumer TB
Issues are as follows:
Both bed ends leak (shells)
Both bed lids cracked
Roof tent replacement
O.H.C 1 replace end
Hockey Stick Replace
Shower Fan only works when roof lights on
Align drawer under Island Seat
F/G repair LHS Main Door
Rear storage cab replace extrusion (rub on fridge cab)
Rear mattress replace – new 2 piece style
Re-paint bodytop corners and remove overspray on cabinetry from previous touch
Replace Offside Green Swirl Decal
De-Lam shower walls
stated in his affidavit that in his experience, each of the issues listed in
that email was minor, or purely cosmetic, and
easily and cheaply rectified.
next day, on 31 October 2014, Mr Rigby replied to Mr Holman,
relevantly stating –
I’ve spoken to [
Consumer TB
] this morning
so hopefully he will be okay – he’s still asking for Jayco Sydney to
buy the van back but I’ll leave
this for you to discuss with your Dealer
[principal] if necessary.
I’ll keep you updated of the progress – I’m working a few boys
tomorrow to knock over what we can but obviously
we have not got walls and hard
The walls seem pretty loose so we may be able to reuse if we can get them off in
relation to the reference in this email to
Consumer TB
asking that
Jayco Sydney “buy the van back”, Mr Holman stated in his
affidavit that Jayco Sydney did not buy RVs from
anyone except Jayco Corp, and
that it only accepted trade-in RVs from customers.
that day, Mr Rigby and Mr Holman exchanged further emails, in which
Mr Rigby asked for
Consumer TB
’s mobile telephone number,
which Mr Holman provided.
6 November 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Holman, in which he relevantly stated –
Thanks for trying to get in contact with me late last
week and this week.
I spoke with a guy from Melbourne last Friday and he explained that he was not
aware of the delamination in the ensuite. I explained
that this was fixed by
Jayco Canberra but he said that the ensuite had delaminated once again so he
would have to order parts which
would add another 15 days to the situation.
On top of that he said that he received [an] email from Jayco Sydney that
morning that detailed other issues that he was not aware
of and was not on his
original list? The cracked bed ends was an example of this. He will also need to
order new hard lids and this
will also add 15 further days.
Just more issues that to be honest - I expected.
I am yet to hear if they will still be able to meet my timeline of the caravan
back in Sydney by the 21
Thanks again for the phone calls
following day, on 7 November 2014, Mr Holman replied to
Consumer TB
, relevantly stating –
I have spoken to the Service Manager about your shower
walls. I have let him know that the shower walls are to remain a one piece
and a join will not be a sufficient fix. I have also advised him that [...] the
“new type” shower walls with the
plain white finish will be fine to
use if they fit.
I will ring the factory on Monday to get an update on how they are going. I will
on 7 November 2014,
Consumer TB
replied to Mr Holman,
relevantly as follows –
As discussed before the van went to Melbourne, I was
hoping to have something in writing providing details about what and how things
were going to be repaired. At this point I have only had a verbal discussion
with Phil and we did not speak about all of my concerns
and how they intended on
addressing them. I just need to have it clear in my mind about everything that
is going to be completed.
forwarded that email to Mr Rigby of Jayco Corp. On
11 November 2014, Mr Rigby replied to
Consumer TB
Mr Holman, with an update on the repair works conducted at the Jayco Corp
The unit is currently in the workshop and we are
carrying out the following repairs as per telephone conversation with of
Consumer TB
] last week
1: Replace bed lids and check for leaks - these have been changed and new seals
installed. The unit will be put through the water
tester when complete.
2: Roof tent replacement - this has been changed and roof wires separated down
two adjacent sleeves
3: Screw loose in OHC - repaired
4: Replace bed hockey stick (clip broken) - replaced/repaired
5: Align drawer under island seat – repaired
6: Rear cabinet rubbing on fridge cabinet – repaired and cabinet adjusted
so it does not rub
7: Replace rear mattress – replaced with new 2 piece version as per
current builds
8: Repaint body top corners and remove overspray from previous repair –
repaired and cleaned
9: Replace offside green swirl decal – replaced
10: De-lam shower walls - these have now been repaired as a set of shower walls
were sourced
11: Repairs to side wall next to entrance door – contractor coming this
week to assess & repair
12: Shower fan only works with roof light – unfortunately this is standard
wiring on all the Pop top range and we cannot access
the roof space to alter as
it is a pressed roof.
We have fully assessed the shower area when the shower walls were replaced and
we can see no signs of water damage from previous
leak. During this procedure
the toilet and vanity unit were removed and we had full access to all areas of
the cubicle.
All being well the unit should be finished early next week for return to Jayco
stated in his affidavit that many of those repairs were very minor or cosmetic.
Mr Rigby stated that the two items that were
the main focus were the tent
replacement, which was not a major job but did require a slight elevation of the
roof to fit the tent,
and the delaminated shower walls. Mr Rigby stated
that in his experience, those issues would not hinder or render unsafe the use
of the RV, and that once repaired, the tent and shower walls would be the same
as in any new RV.
13 November 2014, Mr Rigby, Mr Holman, and
Consumer TB
exchanged emails in relation to the repairs to
Consumer TB
’s RV. Mr Rigby stated –
Consumer TB
]’s van is pretty much complete
- I am having the paint work attended to today.
One item below which we I am not sure about is number 3: below the OHC screw
On your original mail you asked us to change the end panel but when speaking to
Consumer TB
] direct it was a loose screw only - can you confirm what the
actual issue was so I can double check when we sign it off.
The only outstanding item I am waiting for are the decals for the new hard lids
– I have been given a delivery date of the
27/11 as these were not on the
original repair list and only ordered when the van arrived.
We do have some older decals in stock at Spare Parts which we can install
temporarily or we can leave them blank and send the new
decals on when they
arrive for you to fit – please advise.
Thanks for the extra man hours that have been put in on
the weekend work for this van.
In regards to the overhead end, I recall the stay had been put back in place
using a screw and some V4, this why I said I going to
replace the end as the
screw seemed to be stripped.
In regards to the decals, Mr [TB] will have to tell us what is to be done,
he lives in Canberra, so you might have to send them to
Consumer TB
Phil as I said to you on the phone it was a [loose]
screw although it had been attempted to be repaired without luck. I also said
that if it was screwed in any further the screw would come through the side
wall. There was some kind of silicon used to fix the
problem – obviously
didn’t work. Your call on how [to] rectify this issue.
In regards to the decals, they will have to be sent to Canberra. Are they easy
to install? If so I will do it myself as I am not
confident in Jayco Canberra
being able to do this within the next 3 months!
Thanks for the info – I’ve identified the
stay that is giving problems and sure we can rectify without replacing the end
I’ve been onto the decal [manufacturers] direct and hopefully we should
have these tomorrow or Monday at the latest.
17 November 2014,
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Rigby and Mr Holman, seeking an update –
I was just wondering the latest news about the van and
[its] progress?
I was also wondering about the end result of the ensuite basin. As you would
recall during our conversation I mentioned the dis colourisation
of it and the
outside door. You said you would investigate as it was out of the ordinary for a
basin for its age to turn yellow.
You also said that it may have something to do
with the skylight?
Thanks for your efforts in rectifying all of the
following day, on 18 November 2014, Mr Rigby replied to
Consumer TB
and Mr Holman, copied to Mr Manning, with an
All repairs are now complete – the van is
currently at the water test facility today to confirm there are no leaks on the
hard lids that have been installed.
We have a new vanity basin when the shower walls were changed – on older
vans (normally over 5 years of age) the roof hatch
lid can go quite clear and
let a lot of UV light in but yours seems fine.
The exterior doors are bought in via a third party supplier, in this case Camec.
Although they try and match the colour to the vans
this can vary slightly from
batch to batch. Please see attached picture of another unit of the same age and
here at the factory workshop.
I will ask Peter to make a note on your warranty file for reference to the door
concerns but at this stage it is quite normal.
The only outstanding parts item is the decals for the hard lids - we have
managed to source a set for the front lid but not the rear
so I may need to
forward these onto Canberra when in stock.
The unit is scheduled for delivery back to Jayco Sydney tomorrow morning and
should be there on Thursday.

completely repaired. Mr Holman

25 November 2014, Mr Rigby sent an email to “Jayco Canberra
Service”, copied to Mr Holman and Mr Manning, in which
relevantly stated –
We had the above van [referring to
’s RV] here at the factory for some warranty repairs via Jayco
Sydney a week or so ago.
We had to replace the hard lids but we did not get the rear decals in time prior
to shipping back – I have forwarded these
onto Jayco Canberra as I
understand the owner lives there.
Can you please install and put through a warranty claim through normal
is no evidence as to whether
Consumer TB
had these new decals
installed on the RV.
Subsequent use and sale of the RV
Consumer TB
stated that after the RV was returned to him following the repair works at the
Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong, he never used it
again. He stated that the
discolouration between the original yellowed external panels of the RV, and the
replacement vivid white
panels, meant that the RV no longer looked new.
Consumer TB
also stated that since he did not use the RV again, he
did not know whether there were any other issues with it, including whether
still leaked. During cross-examination,
Consumer TB
accepted that to
the best of his knowledge, all of the repairs were completed at the Jayco Corp
factory in Dandenong.
Consumer TB
stated that he then sold the RV by private sale, for less than the $38,916 that
he paid for it. During cross-examination,
Consumer TB
was pressed on
the details of this re-sale. Surprisingly, given his attention to detail in
other respects, he stated that he did
not recall exactly what price he received
for the RV, but that it was not thousands less than what he originally paid for
it. I conclude
Consumer TB
’s evidence that he received
not significantly less than $38,000 on the re-sale of the RV.

July 2014 (after return from repairs)
Defects reported to Jayco Corp on 14 July 2014
and Jayco Sydney on 22 July 2014.
Further report to Jayco Sydney on
19 August 2014.
Several existing defects outstanding but in addition:
scratches and damage to outside wall of RV (caused by attempted repairs by Jayco
Canberra); vinyl pop top skirt ripped; water damage to the ensuite; front and
back bed ends were still leaking from the hard lid
to the canvas; aluminium
shavings and wearing of the luggage area under the mattress; discolouration of
the ensuite sink; pop top
did not seal and painted [sic] required.
Prior to 18 August 2014
Defects reported to Jayco Sydney on
15 September 2014.
Crack in high pressure pipe behind ensuite
August 2014
Identified by Jayco Sydney whilst RV was in for
was some duplication in the defects alleged by the ACCC in the particulars. For
instance, the defect with the air conditioner
referred to in item 3 appears
to be the same defect as that alleged in item 4, and the internal leaking
referred to in item 6 was
likely caused by the crack in the water pipe
behind the ensuite vanity referred to in item 8. The principal defects in
the RV that
have been proven to my satisfaction are –
(1) leaking through the roof of the RV;
(2) leaking through the bed lids of the RV;
(3) ensuite walls de-laminating;
(4) a defect with the air conditioner; and
(5) a water leak caused by a cracked water pipe behind the ensuite vanity
also accept that there was a range of other issues affecting the RV that were of
a lesser order, but which were still relevant,
as they bore upon the total fit
and finish of the RV, which is material to whether the RV was of acceptable
quality for the purposes
of s 54 of the ACL. Those other issues included
the vinyl pop top, which was not properly glued where it covered some
defect with the air conditioner was repaired, but not until after a number of
attempts. So too was the water leak caused by the
cracked pipe, which was
identified and repaired by Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney by
1 September 2014. I am not persuaded that the cracked
pipe, or its
cause, was present when the RV was supplied by Jayco Sydney. It is at least
equally probable that the cracked pipe was
caused by works undertaken by Jayco
Canberra, which performed repairs to the ensuite in June 2014, which may
have resulted in damage
to the pipe. The pooling of water immediately in front
of the ensuite door and the beading of water along the trim and edge of the
walls and cabinetry had not been the subject of any observation by
Consumer TB
prior to the July 2014 trip, and in
cross-examination
Consumer TB
accepted that it was a new issue. The
significance of this is that, if relevant, Jayco Sydney as the supplier of the
RV may not have
been liable for the damage to the pipe caused by Jayco Canberra,
or by Jayco Corp in the course of the supply of its repair services
Jayco warranty.
Consumer TB
referred in evidence to the leaking of water into the bed areas that
occurred in the RV as a result of rainfall during family trips
in May 2013,
July 2013, and in the period prior to his email to Jayco Canberra on
5 February 2014. He was not challenged in cross-examination
fact of these ingressions of water, or his descriptions of them. He was,
however, challenged about whether upon taking
delivery of the RV he had seasoned
the tent sections in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations
contained in the
Jayco owner’s handbook, and accepted that he had not
] above). However, I am
not persuaded that the primary cause of the ingress of rainwater above the beds
was any initial failure to
season the tent sections in accordance with the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The ingress of rainwater continued beyond
first outing, and occurred on the trip to Queensland in July 2013, and
on later trips in late 2013, and early 2014. I find that the
cause of the leaking was a problem with the lid sections, which were the subject
of attempted repairs on several occasions.
were some respects in which I consider that
Consumer TB
representative of the hypothetical reasonable consumer. I formed the impression
based upon the documentary evidence and his
answers in cross-examination that
Consumer TB
was especially sensitive to the risk of any
imperfections in his RV, when the statutory standard of acceptable quality is
this case at least, a standard of perfection. However,
Consumer TB
’s levels of tolerance were tested by what were
significant defects in the RV, and the languid approach taken by Jayco Canberra
in its dealings with him about those defects.
I have mentioned, after the RV was returned to
Consumer TB
Jayco factory in November 2014, he did not use it again, and he sold it. As
I have also mentioned,
Consumer TB
expressed dissatisfaction with
the colour of the new bed lids, which were white, and did not match the rest of
the RV which had commenced
to discolour. I am not persuaded in the absence of
more precise evidence such as photographs or an objective appraisal, that this
was an issue that would have troubled the reasonable consumer. I find that there
is no reason to think that the RV was not fit for
purpose after it had been
repaired at the Jayco factory.
Was Consumer TB entitled to reject the RV?
I have detailed above,
Consumer TB
’s RV was repaired on
approximately ten occasions: by Jayco Sydney in June-July 2013 and in
August-September 2014; by Jayco
Canberra twice in November 2013, in
March 2014, another time in mid-2014, in June 2014 and in
July 2014; by the Caravan Wizard at
Nelson Bay in July 2014; and
finally by Jayco Corp in Dandenong in September-November 2014. The
documentary evidence relating to
those repair works is incomplete, and I cannot
be certain of precisely when all the repairs were conducted, and of all the work
was undertaken. In particular, some of the repair works undertaken by Jayco
Canberra that I have placed sometime in mid-2014, in
June 2014 and in
July 2014, may have taken place over an extended period in which the RV
remained at that dealership, as some of
the correspondence suggests. Further, as
I have stated in summarising the repairs to the RV, there are no warranty claim
other documents before the Court that provide an itemised description
and cost of the works carried out on the majority of those
occasions. This
limitation of evidence makes it difficult to undertake a comprehensive
assessment of the totality of the repairs
conducted on the RV. Nonetheless, on
the available evidence, it is apparent that an indicative cost of the repair
works conducted
Consumer TB
’s RV included at least the
following –
(1) from the March 2014 Jayco Canberra repair
works, referred to at [
above, being repairs to the leaking bed lids and to address other issues with
fittings inside the RV, a total cost before GST and
not including the
administration fee of $132.45;
(2) from the June 2014 Jayco Canberra repair works, referred to at [
] above, which included the
replacement of the de-laminating ensuite walls, the replacement of the roof tent
and also repairs addressing
other minor issues with fittings inside the RV, a
total cost before GST and not including the administration fee of $3,080.66;
(3) from the July 2014 Jayco Canberra repair works, referred to at [
] above, for the replacement of a
mattress, a cost before GST and not including an administration fee of
(4) from the September-November 2014 Jayco Corp repair works at the factory
in Dandenong, referred to at [
] above, an indicated value before GST
of $5,239.57.
have drawn the indicated value of the works undertaken by Jayco Corp at
Dandenong from the quotation that Jayco Sydney prepared
5 August 2014, as set out in the email at [
] above. That quotation accounted for
“new shower walls, two new bed lids and decals to suit, a new roof,
several extrusions
and a hockey stick”. Those works, along with some
others, were later completed by Jayco Corp at its factory in Dandenong. This
evidenced by Mr Rigby’s email to
Consumer TB
Mr Holman dated 11 November 2014, set out at [
] above, in which he refers to the
repair works conducted by Jayco Corp at its factory in Dandenong, including
“replace bed
lids”, “roof tent replacement”,
“replace bed hockey stick” and “de-lam shower walls”.
value of the works is indicative, because the direct cost of the works to
Jayco Corp is not able to be quantified.
the above works amounted to an estimated value of at least $8,836.68 worth of
Consumer TB
’s RV. That does not include the cost of
any repairs to rectify issues arising from Jayco Canberra’s earlier repair
such as Mr Holman’s work in August-September 2014 to
identify and fix the leak behind the vanity in the ensuite, or repairs
Jayco Canberra’s defective fibreglass work. Further, it is likely that the
actual cost of all of the repair works conducted
on the RV, including the
substantial number of works for which there is no quotation or cost in evidence,
was higher.
repair works required to be undertaken on
Consumer TB
conducted on approximately 10 occasions over the 15 month period
between June 2013 and September 2014, are indicative
of the extent of
the defects in the RV. While I have found that
Consumer TB
sensitive to some imperfections in his RV, and I accept to a degree Jayco
Corp’s submission that some of the defects in
Consumer TB
’s RV were minor or merely cosmetic, and that some
involved rectification of repairs that were attempted by Jayco Canberra,
nonetheless find that the extent of the defects in the RV was collectively
significant. This is especially so in relation to the
defective bed lids, which
I find were the likely causes of the leaks that were such that the RV did not
provide acceptable shelter
from the weather, which went to the heart of one of
its purposes. The absence of reasonable shelter from the weather detracted
from one of the common purposes of an RV, including the opportunity
to enjoy family holidays: cf,
Moore v Scenic Tours Pty Ltd
[2020] HCA 17
377 ALR 209.
I consider that the reasonable consumer would not have tolerated
the extent to which
Consumer TB
’s RV departed from the
guaranteed standard of acceptable quality. I find that a reasonable consumer,
fully acquainted with
the defects and what was involved in attempting to repair
them, would not have acquired the RV, and therefore there was a major failure.
Consumer TB
made several requests for a refund, or a replacement RV. He made some of those
requests to Jayco Canberra and to Jayco Corp, but
importantly, he also made
requests to the supplier, Jayco Sydney. My findings as to these requests are as
(1) on 5 February 2014,
Consumer TB
raised the possibility of a replacement RV in an email that he sent to Jayco
Canberra, although he did not insist on a replacement
(2) on 4 March 2014,
Consumer TB
requested a refund in an
email to Mr Manning of Jayco Corp (see [
(3) on around 5 March 2014,
Consumer TB
requested a refund
from Jayco Sydney (see [
(4) on around 14 July 2014,
Consumer TB
requested a refund
or a replacement RV in a telephone conversation with the receptionist at Jayco
Canberra, and again in a telephone
conversation with Mr Manning of Jayco
Corp (see [
(5) in around mid-July 2014,
Consumer TB
requested a
replacement or refund from Jayco Sydney (see [
(6) on 22 July 2014,
Consumer TB
requested a refund or
replacement RV in a telephone conversation with Ms Guy of Jayco Sydney
(7) on 7 August 2014,
Consumer TB
requested a replacement
RV in an email to Mr Manning of Jayco Corp and Mr Holman of Jayco
Sydney (see [
] above); and
(8) on 14 August 2014,
Consumer TB
requested a refund or
replacement RV in an email to Mr Manning of Jayco Corp, and Mr Bilbija
and Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney, which
referred to his communications with
New South Wales Fair Trading (see [
Consumer TB
’s requests to Jayco Sydney for a refund
or replacement RV were made within a reasonable time of the failure to comply
the statutory guarantee of acceptable quality becoming apparent having
regard to the ongoing nature of the faults, and the failure
authorised dealer to repair them. These failures to repair contributed to a full
appreciation of the relevant failure
to comply with the statutory guarantee of
acceptable quality becoming apparent.
(3) Consumer JT
Purchase of the RV
Consumer JT
purchased a Jayco Expanda Outback
pop top RV, with a single axle, from the dealer, Jayco Sydney. The agreement to
purchase was effected
at the Sydney Caravan Supershow at the Rosehill
racecourse.
Consumer JT
attended the show at Rosehill, and spoke to
a salesperson. The salesperson gave
Consumer JT
a brochure for
Expanda vans, and
Consumer JT
was given a demonstration as to how to
set up an Expanda van.
two relevant features of Expanda pop top RVs, described at [
] above in relation to
Consumer TB
’s RV, were also present in
Consumer JT
’s RV. Those were the pop top roof and the hard bed
lids over the canvas bed ends, both of which are illustrated in the picture
below, which has been extracted from a Jayco brochure that was in
Consumer JT
purchased the new Expanda RV to replace an older Jayco Eagle Outback pop top,
which he considered was no longer large enough for
his family, and which was
difficult to set up.
Consumer JT
and his wife had three children,
the eldest of whom had a serious physical disability.
Consumer JT
agreed to pay a purchase price for the Jayco Expanda of approximately $39,000.
He paid a deposit of $1,000 upon ordering the RV from
Jayco Sydney at the
Rosehill Caravan Supershow, and paid the balance of the purchase price upon
accepting delivery of the RV.
Pre-delivery check and repairs to the RV
to delivery of the Expanda to
Consumer JT
, Jayco Sydney conducted a
pre-delivery check of the RV and identified that a smoke detector in the RV was
faulty. On 27 August 2015,
Jayco Sydney removed and replaced the smoke
detector, at a total cost of $20.63, which was borne by Jayco Corp.
Delivery of the RV and Consumer JT’s initial
Consumer JT
took delivery of his RV at Jayco Sydney on 31 August 2015.
Consumer JT
gave evidence about advice that he received at that time in
relation to weathering or seasoning the canvas on his RV, although there
some discrepancies between his affidavit evidence, and his answers in
cross-examination on this topic. In his affidavit,
Consumer JT
stated that during the handover process, he was told by either a staff member of
Jayco Sydney, Ms Naomi Eddison, or the service manager
at Jayco Sydney,
Mr Holman, that the RV had been thoroughly water tested before delivery,
and that he understood this to mean that
he was not required to soak or hose the
canvas on the RV prior to use, or at any other time. However, during
cross-examination,
Consumer JT
gave the following
Q; What gave you the impression that there had been
weathering prior to delivery to you?
A: Because we were told that.
Q: And who do you say told you that?
A: Well, Jayco.
Q: I beg your pardon?
Q: Who do you say told you that?
A: Someone from Jayco Sydney when they rang me up and said that the van was in
the production line and was getting weathered or water
tested, and “you
should be taking delivery of the van soon”.
Q: And when did that conversation occur, Mr [JT]?
A: Before the delivery of the van.
Q: Well, when before the delivery of the van do you say that conversation
A: I can’t recall the exact date. When they called me to say that the van
was – you know, it was ready to get delivered,
Q: So you say someone from Jayco Sydney, was it, rang you?
A: Correct, yes. They called me and they – they said, “Your van is
nearly ready to be, you know, picked up. This is what’s
Q: “This is what’s going on”?
A: Well, you know, it’s getting weather tested in the factory, getting
delivered. “We will call you when it’s in
Q: And where do you give evidence of this conversation in your affidavit?
A: I don’t. Like I said, there’s that much that has happened that
probably things that I have missed.
Q: I beg your pardon?
A: There’s that many things that have happened that I probably have
Q: So it’s not anywhere in your affidavit; you agree with that?
A: Not that I can recall, no.
his part, Mr Holman gave evidence in response to
Consumer JT
’s claim by drawing on his experience of the Jayco
Corp production line. As I have noted in introducing Jayco Corp’s
Mr Holman worked at Jayco Corp for 14 years prior to joining Jayco
Sydney. He stated that he had commenced his employment
at Jayco Corp as an
installation technician and finished as a production manager, and that during
most of his time at Jayco Corp,
his role was devoted to the pop top caravan
line. Mr Holman stated that he knew that the RVs were not seasoned or
weathered at the
Jayco Corp factory, and therefore he would not have said
anything to
Consumer JT
to suggest that weathering or seasoning the
RV was not required. Further, Mr Holman stated that water testing an RV,
and seasoning
or weathering an RV, are not the same thing, and that the Jayco
owner’s handbook included clear statements about seasoning
or weathering
issue was relevant because Jayco Corp relied at trial on those terms of the
owner’s handbook set out at paragraph [
] above, which referred to soaking the
canvas and allowing it to dry, twice, before use on an extended trip. In
relation to the handbook,
Consumer JT
stated that upon taking
delivery of his RV, he was given the owner’s handbook, and his attention
was drawn to the 12 month
Jayco warranty.
Consumer JT
evidence that after he took delivery of the RV, he read the handbook in the
sense that he skimmed through the pages, but
he did not read it in great detail.
He gave evidence that he read the warranty information in more detail after he
had experienced
leaks in the RV, and that he recalled reading the first sentence
of the terms of the Jayco warranty which refers to the RV coming
with guarantees
that could not be excluded under the ACL.
Consumer JT
gave evidence
that he did not recall reading that part of the owner’s handbook concerned
with seasoning the canvas.
do not consider that it is necessary to make complete findings about what
Consumer JT
was told about seasoning the canvas of his RV. Any
failure to season has not been shown to be a cause of the substantial leaks that
occurred in
Consumer JT
’s RV in early January 2016, a
matter to which I will come. Having said that, I accept Mr Holman’s
evidence that he did
not suggest to
Consumer JT
that seasoning the
canvas was not required, although I also consider that
Consumer JT
reasonably misunderstood statements from Jayco Sydney to
the effect that the RV had been water tested as suggesting that nothing
was required to ensure that it was water proof. In any event, the relevant
witnesses called by Jayco Corp accepted in evidence
that the issues with leaks
Consumer JT
’s RV were not caused by any failure on his part
to season the canvas, as I shall detail below.
Consumer JT
referred in his affidavit to initial concerns that he held concerning his RV
upon taking delivery of it from Jayco Sydney. He stated
that upon taking
delivery of the RV, he observed the large amount of silicone that had been used
around the joints of the RV. He
stated that he raised this with Mr Holman
at the time of delivery. Mr Holman stated in his affidavit that he did not
recall being
present at the time of delivery of
Consumer JT
RV, and that such attendance was not a usual part of his daily tasks, but that
it was possible that he had been present.
Consumer JT
stated in his
affidavit that he had been “shocked” by how the van looked at the
time of delivery. He stated that it looked
like it had been made quickly, and
that only a rough job had been done. This evidence has to be reconciled with the
mixed responses
Consumer JT
gave in an online survey only a few
days later, which I shall address below.
3 September 2015 – online survey
3 September 2015,
Consumer JT
completed an online survey
Consumer JT
stated the following –
We have found many defects with the van We contacted
dealer and they are more than happy to work with me Unfortunately that has not
van looks like it has been put together with silicone
and there are many poor
finishes I’m am more then [sic] happy to talk to Jayco and have someone
from Jayco to come out and
see the van I am very disappointed with the purchase
Please feel free to contact me on [telephone number]
the other hand, as to the overall presentation of the van,
Consumer JT
responded, “Excellent”.
Consumer JT
stated in cross-examination that this comment applied to
the overall presentation of the van, and that inside and out, he rated the
in a state of excellent presentation. Further on this topic, I note that later
correspondence from Jayco Sydney (see [
] below) records that at around this
Consumer JT
advised Jayco Sydney that he “posted his
survey too early and should have waited.”
3-4 September 2015 – emails to Jayco Sydney
3 and 4 September 2015,
Consumer JT
sent a series of
emails to Jayco Sydney in which he expressed concern about defects that he said
that he had identified in his RV.
Consumer JT
attached to his emails
photographs of those defects, namely a scratch on the bumper bar of the RV, a
black rubber strip that was
too short, a chip on a fibreglass panel on the
outside of the RV’s doorframe, and water entry caused by a leak. In one of
emails, sent at 6.00 pm on 3 September 2015,
Consumer JT
relevantly stated –
I’ve also got a leak
Can you please contact Jayco to get someone out asap to look over
a further email, sent at 6.23 pm on 3 September 2015,
Consumer JT
relevantly stated –
I have sent you images of the external faults on the
van, only to come home today and walk inside the van to find puddles of rain
from last nights [sic] showers.
Images have also been sent to you.
I am extremely frustrated at these defects, one after another and after being
told this van was water tested, I am having doubts
I am requesting that my caravan is picked up from my place and replaced with a
This is not a second hand van, and if this is what I am experiencing now,
who’s to know what else will follow.
Please excuse me taking out my frustration out [sic] on you in this email, but I
did not expect to have these problems.... Especially
the leaking.
I would like to be contact [sic]asap regarding this with some
Consumer JT
emails to Jayco Sydney were forwarded to Mr Holman.
Consumer JT
also noticed that there was a visible gap
between the roof’s canvas skirt and the body of the RV, and that the
reflectors had
fallen off the RV.
September 2015 – Jayco Sydney repair works
Consumer JT
took his RV to Jayco Sydney so that it could be repaired while he was away on an
overseas trip, and Jayco Sydney undertook repairs.
Jayco Sydney produced a
warranty claim document, which set out the repair works performed on
Consumer JT
’s RV and by reference to which Jayco Sydney sought
reimbursement from Jayco Corp for the works. The warranty claim document
that the repair works required a total of 1.5 hours of labour (inclusive of 0.5
hours attributed to an administration fee),
and the cost was $112.50 in labour
and $425.00 in parts, for a total cost with GST of $591.25. The warranty claim
document included
five line items of repair works, with a “reason”
and a “detailed desc[ription]” for each item. Those items
(1) an item with the stated reason
“Damaged”, with the description “Fibreglass repair –
SOS. Chip in fibreglass,
right hand side of door frame, from build. SOS has
repaired chip in fibreglass” (the reference to “SOS” was a
to a third party contractor, SOS Mobile Fibreglass);
(2) an item with the stated reason “Damaged”, with the description
“Bumper bar is scratched. Was scratched from
build. Bumper bar has been
changed. Part was ordered for customer JAC1975Z. Part was freighted”;
(3) an item with no stated reason, with the description “Black rubber
infil [sic] above checker plate too short. Factory fault.
Replaced 5 metres of
rubber infill. Part was ordered for customer JAC2627C”;
(4) an item with the stated reason “Water Leak”, with the
description “Leak in van. Front bed tent was missing
silicone on corners,
allowing water intrusion. Corners have been sealed with silicone, rear bed has
also been checked OK”;
(5) an administration fee.
document records that this warranty claim was approved by Jayco Corp on
4 November 2015. It was likely approved automatically
as the total
cost was below $1,000.
these repairs were undertaken,
Consumer JT
’s RV was returned
Consumer JT
accepted in cross-examination that at that time,
he did not have any complaints about the repair works, although he did not use
RV until his first trip about four months later, in January 2016.
September 2015 – Jayco Sydney correspondence with
Jayco Corp.
8 September 2015, Mr Bilbija, the dealer principal of Jayco
Sydney, forwarded the results of
Consumer JT
’s online survey
Jayco Corp. Mr Bilbija suggested to
Mr Hooper, “Someone from
head office may want to contact this guy?”. Mr Bilbija also arranged
for photographs of
Consumer JT
’s RV to be forwarded to
Mr Hooper. On Mr Bilbija’s instructions, Ms Jessica
Saffrett of Jayco Sydney sent an email to
Mr Hooper that attached
photographs of
Consumer JT
’s RV, which had been attached to
Consumer JT
’s emails to Jayco Sydney sent on 3 and
4 September 2015 and referred to at [
] above. In the email, she relevantly
Please find attached, photos related to this van. We
have this van in here now to rectify his warranty issues. He did ring and say
that he posted his survey too early and should have waited.

22 December 2015 – telephone conversation with
Mr Manning of Jayco Corp
22 December 2015, Ms Guy of Jayco Sydney forwarded the results of
Consumer JT
’s online survey about his RV to Mr Manning of
Jayco Corp, and Mr Manning telephoned
Consumer JT
his concerns with his RV.
Consumer JT
referred to this conversation
in his affidavit, although he could not recall the date in December 2015 on
which it took place, or
the name of the manager from Jayco Corp to whom he
spoke. In his affidavit,
Consumer JT
stated that he outlined the
“ongoing problems” that he had been having with his RV to a manager
at Jayco Corp, and that
he asked the manager for either a refund or for what he
had paid for, namely a new RV.
Consumer JT
explained in
cross-examination that the “ongoing problems” to which he had
referred in his affidavit were that the reflectors
fell off his RV while it was
stationary in his driveway, that there was a scratch on the bumper bar, and that
the fibreglass panel
was chipped. In cross-examination,
Consumer JT
did not accept that those concerns were trival. Returning to his conversation
with Mr Manning on 22 December 2015,
Consumer JT
stated that the manager said, “no, we will fix it”, and that he was
only offered a free annual service in response to
his complaint, which he
rejected. During cross-examination Mr Manning accepted that it was likely
that his response to
Consumer JT
would have been to the effect,
“bring it in, we’ll fix it.”
on 22 December 2015 after that telephone call, Mr Manning sent an
email to Ms Guy and Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney, in which he
Just finished call with him. Free annual service offer from us but nothing
He’s not happy. He said he will go to solicitor.
We will fix Jayco warranty faults though
respect of this telephone conversation, I accept that
Consumer JT
requested a refund or replacement RV.
Consumer JT
had already
requested a replacement, in his email sent to Jayco Sydney on
3 September 2015 and referred to at [
] above, and I accept that he
requested a refund or replacement RV during his conversation with Mr Manning. I
also accept that Mr
Manning responded by stating that
Consumer JT
’s RV would be repaired, and by offering a free
annual service.
on 22 December 2015, Mr Holman received a message from the
reception of Jayco Sydney that provided him with
Consumer JT
telephone number for a return telephone call. The evidence does not establish
whether Mr Holman telephoned
Consumer JT
Early January 2016 – trip to Ulladulla
Consumer JT
first trip with his RV was in early January 2016, when he and his family
went to Ulladulla, on the New South Wales south
Consumer JT
stated in his affidavit that on or around 3 January 2016, which was
their first night in the RV, it rained and they experienced leaks
through the
canvas at the bed ends and through the awning that was outside.
Consumer JT
accepted in cross-examination that they experienced
heavy rain, and Mr Rigby of Jayco Corp stated that at that time New South
experienced “extreme rainfall”.
Consumer JT
that the water soaked the mattresses and bedding on which his children were
sleeping, and that in the middle of the night,
his disabled son was soaked and
screaming such that he had to take him outside to the ensuite toilets in order
to calm him down and
get him dry.
Consumer JT
stated that this
distressed and upset him.
Consumer JT
stated that his other children
were also wet, and that he had to do the same thing for them.
Consumer JT
also stated that his son’s PlayStation and the
television in the RV became wet and damaged as a result of the leaks. This
was not challenged in cross-examination.
the following morning, at 5.13 am on 4 January 2016,
Consumer JT
sent an email to Jayco Sydney, requesting that it be
forwarded to Mr Holman, in which he stated –
First night in the caravan
And I’m up at 3am because the caravan is leaking.
I’m not happy about this experience.
Once again I’m going to request

Please call ASAP so we can discuss this further.
email, and another email sent by
Consumer JT
later that morning,
attached a number of photographs of the RV, some of which appeared to show water
droplets around various components
inside the RV. Those emails were forwarded to
Consumer JT
stated in his affidavit that later on 4 January 2016, Mr Holman
called him and that they had a conversation to the following
Mr Holman: You have to give us a chance to fix
Consumer JT
: I have already given you a chance to fix it, and
it’s still not fixed. I want my money back or a replacement.
Mr Holman: Look, you’ll never get a refund or replacement from Jayco
Sydney because we buy the caravan off Jayco Corporation.
Once we buy the van, we
then own it. Once we sell it off, it is up to us to do the warranty work, which
gets paid by Jayco Corporation.
But if we decide to give you your money back or
a new van, Jayco Sydney have to buy the van from Jayco Corporation and give it
you. This money will have to come out of Jayco Sydney’s pocket.
Consumer JT
: Jason, I can’t do that to you. That’s not
Mr Holman: That’s the way it is.
Consumer JT
: That’s not the way it should be Jason, you did
not build the van, it was built by Jayco Corporation in Melbourne. You’ve
done nothing but help me.
his part, Mr Holman stated in his affidavit that he did not recall the
conversation with
Consumer JT
on 4 January 2016, to which
Consumer JT
referred. Mr Holman further stated that he has
never said to any customer that they would not get a refund or replacement
first inspecting the RV and discussing the request with the Jayco Sydney
dealer principal, Mr Bilbija. Mr Holman stated that he did
authority to provide refunds or replacements, and that his usual statement to
customers asking for refunds or replacements
was to ask them to bring the RV in
for assessment of the problems.
Separately,
Mr Rigby, who at the time was the customer relations manager of Jayco Corp,
stated in his affidavit that he had a clear
recollection of dealing with
Consumer JT
in early 2016. Mr Rigby stated that
Consumer JT
notified him that while he was on holiday using his RV,
the front of his tent had leaked, resulting in a wet mattress. Mr Rigby
that he told
Consumer JT
to purchase a new mattress so that
he could still use his RV whilst on holiday, and said that Jayco Corp would
reimburse him for
the cost of an air mattress. Mr Rigby stated that the
following day,
Consumer JT
called him to notify him that he had
dried the mattress out in the sun, and that Jayco Corp should not worry about
the air mattress.
During cross-examination,
Consumer JT
stated that
he could not recall any conversations to the effect of Mr Rigby’s
relation to these alleged telephone conversations, I accept that a conversation
Consumer JT
and Mr Holman took place after
Consumer JT
sent his email to Jayco Sydney on
4 January 2016, and I accept that consistently with that email, he
requested a refund or a replacement
RV, to which Mr Holman did not agree.
Otherwise, I do not find it necessary to make detailed findings in relation to
the conversation,
save that I am not persuaded to find that Mr Holman
Consumer JT
that he would “never get a refund or
replacement from Jayco Sydney” in circumstances where Mr Holman had
not inspected
the RV on that occasion. I accept that
Consumer JT
discussed the substance of his concerns with Mr Holman in the conversation,
and that Mr Holman indicated that Jayco Sydney would
need to assess the RV
before making any decision as to whether to grant
Consumer JT
’s request for a refund or replacement, as was
Mr Holman’s practice with other such requests. Furthermore,
Mr Holman was
cross-examined on the basis that it was likely that he told
Consumer JT
that he needed to give Jayco Sydney a chance to fix the
problem, which proposition he accepted.
Separately,
in relation to Mr Rigby’s evidence of speaking to
Consumer JT
in early 2016, I find that
Consumer JT
spoke to Mr Rigby around this time, and that the
discussions between them
were as described by Mr Rigby in his
gave evidence that at this time, he considered that the leaks were likely caused
by the extreme rainfall in New South Wales
during the 2015-2016 Christmas-New
Year Period and
Consumer JT
failing to season the tents of his RV as
described in the owner’s handbook, such that water could have entered
through the
stitching holes. Mr Holman held the same view at that time.
However, Jayco Corp later discovered that there was a manufacturing fault
caused leaks through the bed lids of the 2015 model Jayco Expanda, for
which it later distributed to its dealer network a bulletin
setting out the
method to install a fix, as I shall address below. During cross-examination,
Mr Holman and Mr Rigby each accepted,
with the benefit of hindsight,
Consumer JT
’s problems with leaks in his RV had nothing
to do with any failing on his part to season the canvas.
Early 2016 – request for extras from Jayco Sydney
Consumer JT
stated in his affidavit that in early 2016, after his first trip with his
RV to Ullladula, he asked Mr Holman whether Jayco Corp
or Jayco Sydney
would provide him with compensation for the issues that he encountered in the
form of free extras for his RV, namely
a bike rack, a barbeque, storm covers,
and an annex.
Consumer JT
stated that Jayco Sydney agreed to provide
him with free storm covers.
Mid to late January 2016 – correspondence with Jayco
19 January 2016,
Consumer JT
sent an email to
Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney in which he stated –
As you are well aware of the ongoing issues I am having with my new purchase of
the Jayco Expanda, I am also aware that you are willing
to help solve these
issues and I am also aware that my first service is due on 1 February 2016.
However, I can no longer deal with this stress that Jayco has put myself and
family through, after the horrible experience we have
endured on our first trip
I purchased a new caravan for the purpose of not encountering these types of
problems, and after waking multiple times throughout
the night, only to find my
child who is disabled, drenched all over and crying, this was the last
This happened for nearly 4 days in a row.
You cannot keep ensuring me that these leaks will stop because they only got
I am also aware that according to the ACCC and the Dept Fair Trading which we
have contacted, once your van is used, it is no longer
considered a New van.
However, as you are well aware, these issues occurred prior to us ever using he
[sic] van, in fact, it was
sitting in our yard when it first leaked.
Jayco then rejected my request for my money back or new van, and said that the
problem would be fixed under warranty.
On the delivery of the van the second time after warranty repairs were done, I
was assured that the van was definitely water tested
once again, as I was
informed that it is tested in the production line.
So, I am aware that the canvas has to be weathered properly twice as stated in
your handbook.
It was weathered at the factory during water testing, we then picked it up and
it rained at home (the first leaks occurred), it then
was re water tested after
repairs were done under warranty at Jayco St Mary’s again.
That is 3 times already.
Jason, $40,000 for a product, anyone would hope that this product would be ready
to be used upon purchase.
It’s like purchasing a new vehicle with no windscreen.
Not only do we have a leaking van, we also discovered more defects along the
way, together with drenched mattresses which will mound

which were purchased from my physio for the family ($900), drips through the
awning that you viewed on the
image that damaged my sons PlayStation also.
Jason, I will never put myself nor my family through this horrible experience
I will be taking everything out of the van and dropping it off to you on
Saturday, as I won’t be bullied an [sic] longer by
Please advise me of what time is suitable for you.
I would like my van replaced with a brand new one or my money returned.
I am very dissatisfied with this Jayco product.
on 19 January 2016, Mr Holman forwarded
Consumer JT
’s email to Mr Bilbija. The following day, on
20 January 2016, Mr Holman also forwarded
Consumer JT
’s email to Mr Manning of Jayco Corp, and
relevantly stated in his covering email –
Please see below email from Mr [JT], T49313. You
have spoken to this customer before and the last time we talked we offered him a
free annual service and from there he was going to take this matter to his
Since then, he has taken his van away again, as it seems, we still haven’t
been able to fix his water leaks despite testing
prior to him picking it up. We
have had some serious storms whilst he was using his van, I have taken a phone
call from him and I
told him to wax the stitching to see how this would go.
Please advise on replacement.
cross-examination, Mr Holman accepted that his request for Mr Manning
to advise on replacement was consistent with his usual
practice to put such
requests to Mr Manning.
on 20 January 2016, Mr Manning responded to Mr Holman,
relevantly as follows –
Please do full assessment and quote for Jayco with
This will need to [go] past Paul Morgan to review for replacement van.
I do not know if Jayco will offer this; but this is the
receiving that email from Mr Manning, Mr Holman sent two further
emails to Mr Manning, which forwarded the photographs of the
Consumer JT
had sent to Jayco Sydney by him emails on
4 September 2015 and 4 January 2016, referred to at [
again on 20 January 2016, Mr Manning responded to Mr Holman,
relevantly as follows –
I have let Paul [Morgan] know you will send report and
quote once you have assessed. As the owner wants a new
was no evidence that Mr Holman submitted to Mr Manning, or
Mr Morgan, an assessment and quotation for Mr Morgan to review whether
Jayco Corp should supply a replacement RV.
21 January 2016, and given that Mr Holman had not yet responded
to his email sent three days earlier,
Consumer JT
sent a follow-up
email to Mr Holman, in which he relevantly stated –
I am still waiting for a reply with regards to what time
I am able to drop off the van on Saturday I am assuming in the morning.
Awaiting your response
on 21 January 2016, Mr Holman responded, relevantly as
I am sorry to hear about the issues you are having with
your van, Expanda Pop T49313.
As you are aware, our service department is not open on Saturday or Sunday, so
we would like to offer to pick your van up to make
it more convenient for
yourselves.
I have forwarded your request for a new van to Head Office and they have
instructed me to report back with my findings.
If your request for replacement is not met, I will replace the affected tent
sections and replace the mattresses. The van will be
thoroughly water tested and
I will invite you to see this process.
Please let me know if and when you would like the van picked
still on 21 January 2016,
Consumer JT
relevantly as follows –
Thank you for your email.
Picking up the van will be very helpful. Tomorrow will be great in the morning
if that’s suitable for you.
Please let me know and I will assure someone will be there to open
finally on 21 January 2016,
Consumer JT
sent a further
response to Mr Holman, in which he relevantly stated –
I apologise for my short responses today as I was busy
I appreciate you requesting a new van to Jayco on my behalf, and can I confirm
that I will not in any case accept any more fixes
on this product.
As Jayco should be well aware, and it was brought to my attention, this is not
an isolated issue with this model. I am not prepared
to go through this again,
as money has already been lost on this van.
I am completely entitled to a new product as this one is ‘not fit for
purpose’ as instructed under consumers guarantees.
I have emptied the van and have left in there some parts that have fallen off
during this time. The crack in the external rear fibreglass
can be seen clearly
in this image also.
I look forward to hear [sic] from you.
email attached a photograph showing a small imperfection on the external rear
fibreglass panel of
Consumer JT
’s RV. Mr Holman forwarded
the email to Mr Rigby of Jayco Corp, and also separately forwarded it to
Mr Bilbija of Jayco Sydney.
Consumer JT
and Mr Holman then exchanged some further emails in which they settled on
the details of the arrangements for Jayco Sydney to collect
the RV the following
22 January 2016, Mr Rigby sent an email to Mr Holman, in
response to Mr Holman’s earlier email which had forwarded to him
Consumer JT
’s emails to Mr Holman sent on
19 to 21 January 2016 referred to above. Mr Rigby
relevantly stated –
Please send through a report of findings once inspected
– from the email below it does not seem the tents have been
correctly as this is not done at the factory which seems
to be the owners [sic] perception.
was challenged in cross-examination about the fairness and the merits of his
suggestion to Mr Holman that a failure to season
the tents may have been a
cause of the leaking, in response to which he accepted that his assessment had
been incorrect. However,
it was not squarely put to Mr Rigby that his
suggestion in the above email was not made honestly and in good faith. The tenor
Mr Rigby’s evidence was that at the time they did not know of the
actual fault, and that a fix had not been developed.
Telephone conversation with Jayco Corp
Consumer JT
stated in his affidavit that “around this time”, although he could
not recall precisely when, he had a conference call
with a manager from Jayco
Corp and one of his bosses, whose names he also could not recall.
Consumer JT
stated that during this conversation he was again told
that he would not be given a refund or replacement, and was told that his
under warranty, that he needed to give Jayco a chance to fix it, and that they
would fix it. There is no reference in any
of the contemporaneous documents to
any conference call with
Consumer JT
of the type described. However,
Consumer JT
was not challenged about this evidence in
cross-examination, and none of the witnesses called by Jayco Corp directly
addressed the
topic. As to the Jayco Corp witnesses, Mr Morgan stated in
his affidavit that he did not recall dealing specifically with any of
consumers the subject of this proceeding. Mr Manning’s communications
in relation to
Consumer JT
in January 2016 were with Jayco
Sydney. Mr Rigby’s affidavit purported to give a complete account of
his conversations with
Consumer JT
, and it did not refer to a
conference call of the type referred to by
Consumer JT
Mr Austin had retired by July 2015. And Mr Murphy stated that he
had no recollection of
Consumer JT
’s name, van, or
circumstances.
am not bound to accept
Consumer JT’s
evidence that he
participated in a conference call with two employees of Jayco Corp on account of
the fact that he was not challenged
Wallsend District Hospital
(1989) 17 NSWLR 553
at 561 (Kirby P) and
586-7 (Samuels JA). However, I accept his unchallenged evidence about the
conference call, and the statements
that were made to him. There is nothing
inherently improbable about it, and moreover there was no submission by Jayco
Corp that the
evidence about what was said to
Consumer JT
conference call should not be accepted. However, I am not able reliably to make
a finding about precisely when this conference
call occurred.
January to February 2016 – Jayco Sydney assessment and
preparation for repair works
22 January 2016, Jayco Sydney arranged for
Consumer JT
’s RV to be collected from his home and taken to
Jayco Sydney. After the RV arrived at Jayco Sydney, Mr Holman sent an email
Consumer JT
, in which he relevantly stated –
I am writing to confirm that your Pop Expanda, T49313,
has arrived to our dealership.
As per the request from Head Office, I will investigate the issues with your van
and report back to them for assessment.
Jayco Head Office is currently working on a solution for the leak between the
bed lid and van and will forward this to us shortly.
I will be in contact with
you when notified with the direction Head Office wants Jayco Sydney to proceed
after submission of assessment.
I will note the chip on the rear lid also.
Mr Holman’s
email supports inferences that by this time, Jayco Corp was aware of the bed lid
leak issue on the 2015 model Expanda,
and that it was working to develop a
fix for that issue, and that Jayco Sydney was also aware of that situation.
next day, on 23 January 2016, Mr Holman sent an email to his
colleague Ms Saffrett in which he listed the parts that needed to
ordered for three RVs, relevantly including
Consumer JT
I infer from that email that Mr Holman had assessed
Consumer JT
’s RV and identified the parts that he considered
were required to repair it. In his email, Mr Holman relevantly stated as
As per our discussion yesterday, can you please order
the following parts and retain order numbers for express shipment:
Consumer JT
Front bed tent section
Rear bed tent section
Front innerspring mattress
Rear innerspring mattress
on 23 January 2016, Ms Saffrett responded by relevantly stating
“All of these tent sections need authorisation to order.
Do you still want
me to seek authorisation from Pete [Manning] or is he or someone else aware of
all of these already?” Mr
Holman responded by requesting that
Ms Saffrett “seek auth[orisation] from Pete [Manning]”.
27 January 2016, Mr Holman sent an email to a third party
fibreglass repair business, SOS Mobile Fibeglass, in which he requested
quotation to repair the “chip the size of [a] fingernail” on a
fibreglass panel of
Consumer JT
’s RV. The next day, SOS Mobile
Fibreglass quoted $346.50 for the repair.
on 27 January 2016, Ms Saffrett sent an email to Mr Manning,
in which she relevantly stated –
This customer [
] picked up from us on the
Since then, they have had their van [brought] back to us numerous times
regarding issues with their van – poor quality/workmanship.
Customer requires new front and back bed end tent section – A04-177A and
A04-177 – his current tent sections are leaking
and ill-fitting.
Can I please have authorisation to order replacements?
on 27 January 2016, Mr Manning responded to Ms Saffrett,
relevantly as follows –
That’s fine but I need to make sure your team does
the new fix for the bed ends leaking once we release it soon. Hopefully this
Order new tents on this occasion too. Should not really need them on other vans.
Just the fix.
stated that while he had approved the replacement of the tents on
Consumer JT
’s RV, he wanted to make clear to Jayco Sydney that
the Jayco Corp research and development department was looking into the
2015 model Expanda bed lid leak issue, and that a fix would be released to
the Jayco dealer network soon.
28 January 2016, after Jayco Sydney had received the order numbers for
the parts that it had requested from Jayco Corp for the
three RVs including
Consumer JT
’s RV, Mr Holman sent an email to
Mr Rigby and Mr Dennis Body of Jayco Corp, in which he requested that
the parts be delivered
Please see below attached email with order numbers in
red. Can these be pushed through urgently please as these 3 customers are taking
us to fair trading.
We have marked these orders as priority, please contact me if there are any

to be carried out.
forwarded that email to several colleagues at Jayco Corp and asked that they
“please prioritise orders below for tent
section if possible”
because “Jason [Holman] needs some assistance as both these owners are
requesting full refunds so
he wants to carry out the repairs asap.”
Mr Rigby received a response that his colleagues would “get onto it
stated that around this time, he was reviewing the Jayco dealer feedback forum
to see if any other Jayco dealers were aware
of similar problems with leaks
occurring on 2015 model Expanda RVs. Mr Holman was aware that there
was a recurring issue and that
the Jayco Corp research and development
department was working on a solution. On 28 January 2016,
Mr Holman sent an email to Mr Bilbija
that forwarded a table from the
Jayco dealer feedback forum in relation to this issue, which was as follows
responded to.

1 February 2016, Mr Holman sent a further email to
Consumer JT
, in which he relevantly stated –
I have submitted a report to Head Office for your van,
T49313, and they have denied your request for a new van, they have instructed
to order replacement parts.
Upon investigation, I have found that the stitching in the bed tents would not
be able to swell enough to fill the hole of the needle.
I have ordered new bed tents for the front and rear and mattresses to suit. I
have also had the fibreglass chip on the rear lid authorised
to be repaired.
I have liaised with Head office to have these parts shipped ASAP to resolve this
matter as quickly as possible.
Jayco Head Office is currently working on a solution to stop the water ingress
between the lids and the van and will provide us with
the direction we need to
take shortly.
I’ll be in contact with you once parts arrive.
Any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact
relation to this email, Mr Holman said in cross-examination that he was
communicating an instruction that he had received from
Jayco Corp that it would
not replace
Consumer JT
’s RV. Mr Holman was not asked to
specify from whom he received that instruction. For his part, during
cross-examination, Mr
Manning could not recall whether he was involved in
that decision, or whether he escalated it to Mr Morgan or Mr Murphy,
evidence did not otherwise disclose the person from Jayco Corp who
instructed Mr Holman. Mr Holman also gave evidence that he identified
that the problems with
Consumer JT
’s RV were the known
2015 Expanda model bed leak lid issue, and also that the stitching holes in
the canvas were too big, which
had nothing to do with seasoning the canvas.
on 1 February 2016,
Consumer JT
responded to
Mr Holman, relevantly as follows –
Thank you for your email.
Please do not proceed with any repairs on the van until you hear from myself or
my solicitor.
forwarded that email to Mr Manning, and relevantly stated “Customer
does not want us to proceed with any repairs until
responded to Mr Holman later on 1 February 2016, relevantly as
No worries.
If you have storage problems advise owner their insurance probably won’t
cover unless you are doing repairs on van. [Your]
business is not to store vans.
Only repair them.
They cannot just leave van with you. It is their property.
You can charge a small storage fee if you need the van out to allow for other
vans in [sic] come in and work on.
forwarded a copy of that email to Mr Bilbija. Mr Bilbija stated that
he considered Mr Manning’s comments about accommodating
Consumer JT
’s RV at Jayco Sydney to be reasonable, as Jayco
Sydney had previously had several customers who had attempted to store their
at the dealership. Mr Bilbija further stated that while Jayco Sydney had
indicated to such customers that a service fee may be
charged for storing their
RV, to the best of his knowledge, no such fee had ever actually been
2 February 2016, Mr Holman sent an email to Mr Rigby seeking
an estimated time of arrival for the parts that he had urgently requested
three RVs, including
Consumer JT
’s RV. The next day, on
3 February 2016, Mr Rigby followed up with his colleague,
Mr Body of Jayco Corp, who advised that “Orders
have been written and
under way”, and provided the work order numbers for the mattresses and
tents that had been ordered.
January to February 2016 – Fair Trading complaint
late January or early February 2016,
Consumer JT
complaint in relation to his RV with New South Wales Fair Trading. There is no
copy of this complaint in evidence. Soon
Consumer JT
his complaint, he received a letter in response from New South Wales Fair
Trading, which relevantly stated –
As discussed, your concerns were brought to the
attention of Mr Jason Holman, Manager at Jayco Sydney.
Mr Holman advised that the necessary repair will be covered under warranty
pending your approval. Mr Holman further advised that
a refund or
replacement will not be provided as the issues are minor.
NSW Fair Trading cannot order or direct either party to resolve a complaint,
only a court or a tribunal can do this.
If a mutual agreement between the parties is not reached, we do provide options
that may assist you reach a resolution. This may
include tribunals, other
government departments or independent legal advice.
Consumer JT
stated that he was disappointed by this response and that he felt that Jayco
Sydney were talking down the problems with his RV, which
he considered to be
major, as they were affecting his ability to use and enjoy the RV. It is
apparent from subsequent events that
Consumer JT
decided to engage
with Jayco Sydney directly, rather than proceed with his complaint to New South
Wales Fair Trading.
February 2016 – meeting with Mr Holman
early February 2016,
Consumer JT
met with Mr Holman at
Jayco Sydney.
Consumer JT
and Mr Holman gave conflicting
evidence about what occurred during this meeting.
Consumer JT
stated that he explained to Mr Holman the difficulties that he was having
with his RV, and that Mr Holman repeated that he would
not be able to do
anything about providing
Consumer JT
with a refund or replacement.
Consumer JT
stated that Mr Holman said that the RV was
second-hand, so
Consumer JT
could not just get a refund or
replacement.
Consumer JT
stated that Mr Holman explained that
Jayco Sydney bought RVs from Jayco Corp, and that it was up to Jayco Sydney to
offer any refund
or replacement out of its own funds, such that Jayco Sydney
would lose money if it provided
Consumer JT
with a refund or
replacement.
Consumer JT
stated that Mr Holman said that if he
wanted a new RV or his money back from Jayco Sydney, then he would have to go to
Consumer JT
also stated that during this meeting, he showed
Mr Holman the warranty page of the Jayco owner’s handbook, and a page
the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading website which was in evidence
with headings “What is a major problem?” and
“Guarantees on
Consumer JT
stated that he and Mr Holman then
had a discussion about whether the leaks in his RV amounted to a “major
fault”, which
was to the following effect –
[Mr Holman] Yours is not a major fault so you are
not getting your money back. The problems with your caravan were not a major
because we have had a whole heap of vans come through with the same
problems and they’ve fixed them. We know what the problem
is. The issues
can be repaired so it is a minor fault.
Consumer JT
] Well, if you knew what the problem was, you would have
fixed it the first time and I have given you plenty of opportunities to fix
Consumer JT
was not cross-examined in relation to his account of the meeting with
his part, Mr Holman disputed
Consumer JT
’s account of
this meeting. Mr Holman stated that he was certain that he did not tell
Consumer JT
that he could not give him a refund because his RV was
second-hand, or that he would need to go to court if he wanted a new RV.
Holman explained that his role was not to provide refunds, and that he
could not recall any occasion when he suggested to a customer
that they take
Jayco Sydney to court, and that he would never say such a thing. Further,
Mr Holman stated that he did not believe
that he said that Jayco Sydney
would lose money if it gave
Consumer JT
a refund or replacement, as
that was not something that he would ever say to a customer, and he did not
believe he had ever said
such a thing. Mr Holman also stated that he did
not believe that
Consumer JT
showed him the warranty page of the
Jayco owner’s handbook, or a page from the New South Wales Fair Trading
website. Finally,
Mr Holman disputed
Consumer JT
account of their discussion about whether
Consumer JT
a major fault, which I have set out above. Mr Holman stated that he was
confident that he would never have made the
statement attributed to him, as it
was not his role to make any decision or statement like that, and because every
case was considered
on its merits, such that any broad statement about the
treatment of many RVs would not accord with his understanding of how decisions
were made on such requests.
was not cross-examined about his evidence as to what was said at this
find that at this meeting,
Consumer JT
again requested a replacement
or refund, and that Mr Holman on behalf of Jayco Sydney advised
Consumer JT,
in substance, that his request was refused. I do not
consider it necessary to make findings in relation to the other disputed facts
in the accounts of
Consumer JT
and Mr Holman, and the absence
of cross-examination indicates that neither party considered the resolution of
any differences to
be material.
February 2016 – Jayco Corp bulletin with fix for the 2015
model Expanda bed lid leak issue
1 February 2016, Mr Rigby sent an email to the network of Jayco
dealers and service agents in relation to the 2015 model Expanda
leak issue. The email relevantly stated –
Dear Dealers and Service agents,
Please see attached service bulletin for 2015 Expanda bed lids – please
carry out this repair for any owners experiencing water
entry through the bed
lid hinge and the top corners of the bed tent below this area.
A copy has also been put on the Jayco google drive for those with access for
future reference if necessary.
It is also important to confirm the tents have been weathered as per the
instructions in the owners handbook prior to use and if
necessary a suitable
water repellent applied to the stitching.
Thank you for your ongoing support.
attached five page service bulletin provided instructions for the repair of the
2015 model Expanda bed lid leak issue. The bulletin
stated that the total
labour allowance for the repair was 45 minutes per bed, and that the repair
required two parts, being a white
tape seal and translucent silicone, as well as
the use of four tools, being a vice grip clamp, a silicone gun, vinyl prep, and
The steps for completing the repair were to install a white tape seal
adjacent to the bed lid hinge, to clamp the internal corners
to secure the tent,
and then to apply silicone to the tent corners. Mr Bilbija forwarded the
email and attached service bulletin
to Mr Holman, who in turn forwarded it
to a number of other employees of Jayco Sydney.
gave evidence about the fix for the 2015 model Expanda bed lid leak issue.
Mr Rigby stated that the issue was that the hinge
on the lid created a very
small gutter, such that a period of very heavy rainfall would lead to water
exceeding the hinge height
and resulting in water getting through the hinge bar
and onto the tent. Mr Rigby stated that the issue was localised to the
area and that any leak arising from the issue would not cause permanent
damage to the RV. Mr Rigby also stated that the issue might
not have been
discovered if it were not for the extreme rain over the 2015-2016 Christmas-New
Year period, when numerous customers
reported it. Mr Rigby stated that the
fix was simple and that it would take about 30 minutes to complete,
although in this respect
I note that the Jayco bulletin provided a labour
allowance of 45 minutes.
evidence of Mr Rigby needs to be considered in light of other
correspondence before the Court, which indicates that a dealer,
Camperland, raised with Jayco Corp in February 2015 its concerns with the
2015 model Expanda bed lids, including that the
lids did not seal to the
body of the RV. That correspondence was not put to Mr Rigby in
cross-examination. It was, however, put to
Mr Murphy who accepted that as
at February 2015, he was aware of a problem with the hinge of the bed lid
that resulted in water penetration,
and that other dealers had also raised this
problem with Jayco Corp by that time. While I accept that evidence of
Mr Murphy, I also
accept the detailed evidence of Mr Rigby that Jayco
Corp only experienced an increase in reports of leaks through the
Expanda bed lid following heavy and consistent rain over
the 2015-2016 Christmas-New Year school holidays, despite the model of RV
being in use for more than eight months beforehand, including a Melbourne winter
without any known issues.
February – March 2016 correspondence
Consumer JT
stated that after his meeting with Mr Holman in early February 2016,
referred to at [
] above, he decided that since he was
not going to get a refund or a replacement, he would allow Jayco Sydney to
undertake repairs
to his RV. He stated that around this time his RV went into
Jayco Sydney for repairs, and that those repairs probably took more than
month. The evidence as to precisely when
Consumer JT
into Jayco Sydney for repairs, or when those repairs were conducted, was
somewhat imprecise. There is evidence of
correspondence between
Consumer JT
and Mr Holman in mid-February 2016 which
suggests that by that time,
Consumer JT
’s RV was at Jayco
Sydney for the repairs to be undertaken.
12 February 2016,
Consumer JT
sent an email to
Mr Holman, in which he relevantly stated –
Firstly, thank you for your time the other day. It much
much [sic] appreciated and glad we can begin to resolve these matters.
I forgot to mention one thing regarding repairs. The table directly in front of
the door of the caravan, where it is screwed into
the wall, you will see that
the left hand side is faulty where it’s screwed onto the wall. Not sure if
screws were too short
or table has dropped. Can you please check that out
16 February 2016, Mr Holman responded to
Consumer JT
relevantly as follows –
Sorry for the late reply, I was on annual leave Friday
and Yesterday.
I will pass on this information to our team and have this addressed.
Our team will be in contact when parts start to
is also evidence of correspondence between Jayco Sydney and Jayco Corp, and
Jayco Sydney and SOS Mobile Fibreglass, which suggests
that repairs were
conducted on
Consumer JT
’s RV during February and
March 2016, as parts became available.
16 February 2016, Ms Rachel Cotterill of Jayco Sydney sent an
email to other staff, including Mr Holman, providing an update on
status of parts orders for numerous customers, including the tents and
mattresses for
Consumer JT
17 February 2016, Ms Cotterill sent an email to Mr Manning
seeking authorisation to order a replacement awning for
Consumer JT
’s RV, relevantly as follows –
Just need authorization for a replacement Awning for
this customer.
The awning tube is damaged.
Our Service manager [Mr Holman] has spoken to Phil [Rigby], they have
agreed that the Awning needs to be replaced. I just need an
authorization to
on 17 February 2016, Mr Manning responded by providing an
authorisation number for that order.
23 February 2016, Ms Madelyn Wadley of Jayco Sydney sent an email
to her colleague, Ms Saffrett, asking that bottom overhead rails
Consumer JT
’s RV if that had not already been done, and
attaching photographs. Ms Saffrett forwarded that request to
Ms Cotterill for action.
1 March 2016, Mr Holman sent an email to SOS Mobile Fibreglass,
in which he requested “please proceed with repair”
of the chip on
the fibreglass panel of
Consumer JT
’s RV, as previously
12 March 2016, Ms Saffrett of Jayco Sydney sent an email to
Mr Manning in relation to the replacement front tent for
Consumer JT
’s, relevantly as follows –
I’m sure you have a lot on record for this van.
Customer picked up on the 31/8/15.
We recently ordered him a replacement front tent section as the stitching holes
were too big, allowing water intrusion. His replacement
also has large holes and
the stitching is poor quality.
This customer has had many issues with their van, with the main issues being the
water leaks damaging their mattresses and requiring
both new tents. But the
replacement front is no better than the last.
Can I please have authorisation to order customer another replacement front tent
15 March 2016, Mr Manning responded to Ms Saffrett by
stating “Please send pictures for evidence to the sewing department
here”. Mr Manning gave evidence that he requested these photographs
so that he could send them to the Jayco Corp sewing department,
stitched a large number of tents for Jayco RVs. Mr Manning and
Mr Rigby each gave evidence that occasionally the department
would fail to
notice that stitching holes had become too large because the needle had gone
blunt, although usually this issue was
picked up in the manufacturing process by
placing each tent over a light box that illuminated the stitching holes.
24 March 2016, Ms Saffrett sent Mr Manning an email that
attached six photographs of
Consumer JT
’s RV, as requested.
Ms Safrett stated, “Please see pictures attached. Please also note
the fly screen has been overlapped
in places as well.” One of the attached
photographs showed light shining through small holes in the canvas tent of
Consumer JT
’s RV. There is no evidence of any further
correspondence between Jayco Sydney and Jayco Corp in relation to defects in the
replacement tents installed on
Consumer JT
February – April 2016 Jayco Sydney repair works
Sydney produced three warranty claims for the works performed on
Consumer JT
’s RV during this period. Jayco Corp approved all
of the claims.
warranty claim document was for the replacement of the tents and
the mattresses in
Consumer JT
’s RV, and for the transport of
Consumer JT
’s RV to and from SOS Mobile Fibreglass in the
suburb of Penrith in western Sydney. The document stated that the date of repair
was 28 January 2016, however the above correspondence demonstrates
that these works must have been conducted at a later date after
the required
parts arrived at Jayco Sydney. The warranty claim document stated that the
repair works required a total of 2.75 hours
of labour (inclusive of 0.5 hours
attributed to an administration fee), and the cost was $206.25 in labour and
$315.00 in parts,
for a total cost with GST of $573.38. The warranty claim
document included four line items of repair works, with a “reason”
and a “detailed desc[ription]” for each item. Those items
(1) an item with the stated reason “Water
Leak”, with the description “Water leaking through needle holes in
section, needle too big. Water also pooling and sagging the tent. Replaced
tent ends”;
(2) an item with the stated reason “Water Leak”, with the
description “Mattresses damaged due to water leak front
(3) an item with the stated reason “Damaged”, with the description
“Fibreglass chip on rear bed lid. SOS fibreglass
to repair. Travel to and
from Penrith. Chip found on bed lid (rear). From build/manufacture Fibreglass
repair carried out”;
(4) an administration fee.
warranty claim document was for a range of other works conducted
Consumer JT
’s RV. The document stated that the date of
repair was 1 February 2016, however I infer from the other evidence
relating to
Consumer JT
’s dealings with Jayco Sydney around
this period that these works must have been undertaken at a later date, and
likely over
several days. The warranty claim document stated that the repair
works required a total of 13.85 hours of labour (inclusive of 0.5
attributed to an administration fee), and that the cost was $1,038.75 in labour
and $222.16 in parts, for a total cost with
GST of $1,387.00. The warranty claim
document included 15 line items of repair works, with a “reason” and
a “detailed
desc[ription]” for each item. Those items
(1) an item without a stated reason, with the
description “1
SERVICE SINGLE Peter Manning approved for
service to be charged to HO”;
(2) an item with the stated reason “Delamination”, with the
description “1 reflector has come off. Replaced all
reflectors with screw
(3) an item with the stated reason “Water Leak”, with the
description “1 curtain is water damaged from where we
previously did water
test. Water damage to curtain. Replaced curtain”;
(4) an item with the stated reason “Poor Fit”, with the description
“checker plate is not secured properly. CHecker

(7) an item with the stated reason “Manufacturing Fault”, with the
description “Rear ezy lifter needs replacing.

(8) an item with the stated reason “Damaged”, with the description
“Awning tube damaged. Original tube is damaged.

(9) an item with the stated reason “Water Leak”, with the
description “Awning track leaking, to seal track on new

(14) an item with stated reason “Broken”, with the description
“Aerial winder has come off. Part failure. Reattached
handle and tested
operation OK”; and
(15) an administration fee.
warranty claim document was for the work performed by SOS
Mobile Fibreglass to repair the small imperfection on the external rear
fibreglass panel of
Consumer JT
’s RV. The document stated that
the date of repair was 10 March 2016, which broadly accords with
Mr Holman having instructed
SOS Mobile Fibreglass to proceed with this
repair in his email sent on 1 March 2016, referred to at [
] above. The warranty claim document
included a single item of repair works with the stated reason,
“Cracked”, and the
description, “Cracking in Gel cost R/h
corner. Details on attached quote.” The attached quotation described the
as “repair cracked gelcoat on the top right corner” of the bed
lid. The claim was for a total of $544.50.
cross-examination, Mr Manning was taken to each of these three warranty
claims, and he confirmed that none of the repair works
described in any of those
claims included the fix for the 2015 model Expanda bed lid leak issue. The
descriptions of the works in
the warranty claim documents do not appear to
record the application of the “fix” to
Consumer JT
’s RV, at least as part of those works. However,
Mr Holman stated in his affidavit that the fix was applied to
Consumer JT
’s RV, and this evidence was unchallenged. The
ACCC’s pleaded case was that it was not known whether the most recent
to the RV was successful.
addition, in relation to these repair works, there is before the Court evidence
of the following exchange between Ms Saffrett and
Ms Cotterill of
Jayco Sydney on 8 April 2016, which neither of the parties sought to
rely upon but I record for completeness. Ms
Saffrett wrote –

or around 8 April 2016,
Consumer JT
collected his RV from
Jayco Sydney.
8 April 2016, Mr Rodney Loughnan of Jayco Sydney sent an email to
Mr Holman in relation to the return of
Consumer JT
which relevantly stated –
Mr [JT] was happy with all the work that was
completed on the van. The only issue was with the grab handle, we replaced due
to moisture
getting inside. The new one didn’t have moisture in it when
inspected but did when I dropped it off. 3 x new issues have come

on 8 April 2016, Mr Holman forwarded Mr Loughan’s

I am pleased you are happy with the works carried out by
us. Rod [Loughnan] has noted some additional issues we will have on file
when your van returns for later servicing.
Any issues, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
Consumer JT
gave evidence that when his RV was returned on or around 8 April 2016,
he was very happy with the fantastic job that had been done
to get his RV to the
way that it should be, and that he was very happy with the way that
Mr Holman had dealt with him.
his part, Mr Holman gave evidence that the three additional issues raised
in Mr Loughnan’s email were all purely cosmetic,
and that they could
have been caused by normal wear and tear, or by Jayco Sydney during the process
of undertaking repair works on
April 2016 – further leak and proposed trade-in
transaction
between 8 and 10 April 2016,
Consumer JT
experienced
another leak in his RV. Separately, on 10 April 2016,
Consumer JT
had a telephone conversation with an employee of Jayco
Sydney, whose name he could not recall, in which he proposed that he trade
his RV for a new 2016 model Expanda.
Consumer JT
gave evidence
that the employee of Jayco Sydney advised him that he would have to pay $15,000
in addition to trading in his RV, which
Consumer JT
considered to be
ridiculous and which he did not accept. Both of these events are reflected in an
Consumer JT
sent to Mr Holman on
10 April 2016, in which
Consumer JT
relevantly stated
Don’t know if you’ll be able to see video,
but this is why I hate silicon and I’ve been against using it to repair
Also Jason, I got a big shock today when your salesman called me to tell me if I
want to do a trade with a 2016 van, he requested
$15000 plus my van.
That’s a lot of money to lose after using it only once, where it has spent
much time in your yard.
You advised me that wetting the top of my bedsteads could create a leak.
If I need to wash this in future when cleaning my van, how do I go about it, as
this product should be 100% waterproof from top to
Also, whilst works have been carried out on the van, especially at the bed ends,
near the light on the fridge end bed, there has
been some silicone left on the
furniture. Can they be cleaned off also. I appreciate everything you have tried
to do for me, however,
if this is all you can help me with, I am asking you to
put me onto someone higher than yourself as repairing it 4 times now has
very stressful..

from the corner of a frame inside
Consumer JT

vicinity of what appears to be silicon that had been applied.
on 10 April 2016, Mr Holman forwarded a copy of that email and
the attached video to Mr Bilbija, and relevantly stated in his

his affidavit, Mr Holman stated that he considered this further issue
Consumer JT
to be minor, and that he left it with
Mr Bilbija. However, during cross-examination, Mr Holman suggested
that he may have attended
Consumer JT
’s house to fix this leak
in his RV, although he did not have a clear recollection of when he had attended
Consumer JT
Consumer JT
stated that sometime shortly after 10 April 2016, although he could
not recall when, Jayco Sydney conducted further repairs on his
RV. There is no
documentary evidence of those repairs. On the basis of
Consumer JT
’s evidence, I find that Jayco Sydney did conduct
further repairs on his RV, and I infer that, at least at that time, those
repairs were to
Consumer JT
’s satisfaction because he did not
raise any further complaint.
Subsequent use of the RV
April 2016,
Consumer JT
used his RV sparingly. He stated in his
affidavit that he used the RV for trips in December 2016 and
September 2017, and that it
did not rain on those trips, so he did not know
whether the RV would still leak.
examination-in-chief and cross-examination,
Consumer JT
evidence that sometime after he prepared his affidavit in this proceeding in
September 2018 and before he gave evidence
at the trial on
24 July 2019, he used his RV on a trip to Culburra on the New South
Wales south coast.
Consumer JT
gave evidence that during that trip,
he again experienced leaks through the bed lids of the RV when it rained, and
that there were
also defects with the refrigerator door and the air conditioning
unit. However,
Consumer JT
did not mention these further leaks or
make any further complaint to Jayco Sydney or Jayco Corp. During re-examination,
Consumer JT
explained that he did not make any further complaint
because he was over it, by which he meant that he was over all the stress
with dealing with his concerns with his RV.

relation to the
group of items alleged by the ACCC, I accept that
the appearance of the RV upon delivery was affected by the presence of silicone,
and the other sundry matters referred to at [
] above. I do not accept that the
overall appearance of the RV was not to the same standard as the demonstration
model, because the
evidence about the demonstration model that
Consumer JT
saw was imprecise, and a comparison would involve
speculation. The
group of items overlaps with the first to some
extent, and introduces the defect that the RV leaked, which was a continuing
I find that the RV suffered from leakages, and that at the time of
supply of the RV to
Consumer JT
the propensity of the RV to
leak was present, and that its causes included a design defect affecting the bed
lids which at that point
in time had not been identified, and for which no
solution had been found. I also find that poor stitching of the tent section,
the needle that was used left larger than normal holes, likely contributed
to the leaking. The
item also concerns the propensity of the RV to
leak to which I have referred, and which had been present at the time of supply.
accept that the
items were defects in the RV,
and they were the subject of repairs. Jayco Corp did not put to
Consumer JT
that either the crack in the fibreglass or the fault
with the internal table were the result of some misuse. I infer that the causes
of both those faults were present in the RV at the time of supply. I accept the
evidence of
Consumer JT
of the occurrence of the leaks that were the
subject of the
Was Consumer JT entitled to reject the RV?
relation to all the items that have been proven, they constituted at least a
failure to comply with the statutory guarantee of
acceptable quality. That is
because their presence, including those items that might be characterised as
bearing upon appearance
and finish, would not be acceptable to a reasonable
consumer having regard to, amongst other things, the price of the RV, and the
Jayco brochure which
Consumer JT
was given prior to purchase, which
was calculated to convey the impression of high quality manufacturing and the
maintenance of value.
A reasonable consumer would have regarded the propensity
of the RV to leak as most significant, because as I have mentioned earlier,
of the purposes of the RV was to provide shelter, which was necessary for the
enjoyment of family holidays that was a subject
of Jayco Corp’s marketing.
This defect, unless rectified, rendered the RV substantially unfit for a purpose
for which goods
of the same kind were commonly supplied. A more difficult
question is whether the failures and course of events were such that
Consumer JT
was entitled to reject the RV, and to seek a refund or a
replacement.
Consumer JT
requested a refund or a replacement RV on
eight occasions, as follows –
(1) on 3 September 2015,
Consumer JT
requested a replacement RV in an email to Jayco Sydney
(2) on 22 December 2015,

ACCC submitted that by 19 January 2016, having paid about $39,000 for
a brand new RV on the basis of Jayco Corp’s reputation
representations in its brochure as to its high quality,
Consumer JT
had experienced leaking and other defects with the RV before its first use,
and further leaking while on holiday, and the leaking
issues had not been
resolved. The ACCC submitted that the defects in
Consumer JT
RV were manufacturing defects caused,
, by blunt needles which
caused large holes in the canvas, and by defects which allowed water ingress
into the bed lids, and that
in these circumstances by 19 January 2016,
Consumer JT
was entitled to a refund or replacement under the ACL
(1) the defects to his RV had not been rectified within
a reasonable period of time, were still not rectified, and Jayco Corp was
working on a ‘fix’;
(2) the RV was not fit for purpose; and
(3) having regard to the nature of the purchase, the representations that were
made about its quality and features at the time of
the sale and the price for
which it was sold, the RV would not have been acquired by a reasonable consumer
fully acquainted with
the nature and extent of the defects that had affected and
continued to affect the RV.
ACCC relied on Jayco Corp’s failure to challenge
Consumer JT
’s own evidence that he would not have purchased
the RV had he known about the issues affecting it. While that evidence might
probative of what the reasonable consumer might have done, I do not place much
weight on the submission that
Consumer JT
was not challenged on this
topic, because the question is not whether
Consumer JT
purchased the RV, but whether the reasonable consumer would have done so.
its part, Jayco Corp submitted that most of the issues with
Consumer JT
’s RV were minor in nature, some may have involved
wear and tear, and that they were readily fixed. In relation to the leaking,
Jayco Corp submitted that once the cause had been identified, it was fixed
easily and cheaply to the point that in April 2016
Consumer JT
was satisfied and considered that Mr Holman had done a fantastic
am not persuaded that, by themselves, some of the sundry items that Jayco Sydney
repaired for
Consumer JT
were outside the ordinary type of things
that typically might require attention after a period of initial use and
familiarisation
with the RV. The leaking, however, is in another category
because it went to a core purpose of the RV. There was some attraction
Corp’s submission that the “fix” that was developed for the
leaks in the Jayco Expanda was straight-forward,
and that the tent sections were
easily replaced in order to address the problem with the holes for the
stitching. However that may
be, I have arrived at the conclusion that the
reasonable consumer would not have acquired the RV had he or she been fully
with the nature and extent of the failure to comply with the
guarantee of acceptable quality in all its aspects, including the leaking.

have referred briefly to the pop top mechanism in addressing the RVs acquired by
Consumer TB
Consumer JT
earlier. The case of
Consumer RH
’s RV requires some further detail. A pop top is a
hybrid between a camper trailer and a caravan. A pop top, when in its towing
position, is lower in profile and lighter in weight than a conventional caravan,
so it is easier to tow. When a pop top is stationary,
the roof can be raised.
The roof is raised by pushing up on the roof to engage external hydraulic struts
which, at a certain height,
trigger a hydraulic lift system that is fitted that
makes the roof easier to lift. As the roof extends upwards a vinyl skirt unfolds
around the perimeter. That skirt is supported by internal bows, which also
assist in ensuring that the skirt folds inside the RV
when the roof is lowered.
The below picture, which has been extracted from the brochure, shows a
2014 Jayco Journey Outback pop top
with its roof in the lowered
Consumer RH
stated in her affidavit that when she attended Jayco Newcastle to inspect the
pop top RVs, she specifically told the salesman that
she would need to be able
to raise the roof herself, so it needed to be easy for a relatively fit
62 year old woman to use. She stated
that the salesman told her that the
pop top roof was perfect for her, that it was easy to use, and that she would be
able to put
it up on her own, and that she relied on what the salesman said in
this regard.
Consumer RH
also stated that the salesman demonstrated
how to raise the roof on a similar model that was in the lot at Jayco Newcastle,
she had a go at lifting one end of the roof of that model.
Consumer RH
stated in her affidavit that the salesman suggested that she add some extras to
her RV, including rooftop solar panels and air conditioning,
without telling her
that those extras would make the roof heavier, and more difficult for her to
raise and lower on her own. Those
extras added more than 50 kilograms to the
weight of the roof. There is no other evidence before the Court about
Consumer RH
’s discussions with Jayco Newcastle before she
purchased her RV or, more specifically, whether she would be able to raise the
roof of her RV herself, and she was not challenged about these matters in
cross-examination. I accept
Consumer RH
’s evidence that she
conveyed to Jayco Newcastle her concern as to whether she would be capable of
raising the roof herself,
and that Jayco Newcastle led her to believe that she
would not have any trouble with raising the roof of her RV by herself, including
with the additional weight of the extra items installed on top of the
Pre-delivery check and repairs to the RV
practice of Jayco Newcastle was to conduct a pre-delivery check of any new RV
received from the Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong
before delivering the RV to
the purchaser. That pre-delivery check formed part of Jayco Newcastle’s
standard quality control
process which Mr Charleson, the dealer principal
of Jayco Newcastle, said was an important part of the handover process.
4 December 2014, Jayco Newcastle performed the pre-delivery check on
Consumer RH
’s RV and produced a warranty claim document, which
set out the repair works conducted on the RV. The warranty claim document
that the repair works required a total of 0.9 hours of labour, and the cost was
$67.50 in labour and nothing in parts, for
a total cost with GST of $74.25. The
warranty claim document included 3 line items of repair works,
(1) an item that stated “Fault” as the
reason, with the description “Front has come off drawer under seat.
drawer front taken off put glue on the screw stays. Put back together
when dry and tested OK”;
(2) an item that stated “Damaged” as the reason, with the
description “Scratch on internal wall near main door.

(3) an item with that stated “Poor Fit” as the reason, with the
description “Both wheel spats need resealing Scraped

warranty claim document was approved by Mr Manning on
18 December 2014.
Delivery of the RV
on 4 December 2014,
Consumer RH
attended Jayco Newcastle
to collect her RV. As part of its standard handover process, Jayco Newcastle
scheduled the first service
Consumer RH
18 March 2015.
Consumer RH
also signed a Jayco Newcastle
Limited Warranty & Customer Delivery form, which relevantly
I understand my obligations and that I am aware of the
proper maintenance and precautionary procedures required for satisfactory
and that following an internal and external inspection I am happy that
at the time of signing this document, the vehicle is free
of defects and is of
merchantable quality, to the extent of my inspection.
Consumer RH
stated in her reply affidavit that when she collected her RV, she again made
clear to the Jayco Newcastle salesman, whose name she
did not recall, that she
would need to be able to operate the RV and raise the roof herself, and that no
one told her that it was
not suitable for her.
Consumer RH
that she was not afforded an opportunity to check over the RV until she had paid
the balance of the purchase price. This evidence
was not challenged by Jayco
Proper method for raising the roof of the RV
I shall detail in the following sections of these reasons, the principal issue
that arose in relation to
Consumer RH
’s RV was its roof. In
broad terms, the ACCC contended, mainly through
Consumer RH
evidence, that
Consumer RH
’s RV was manufactured with a
defect, such that the body and the roof of the RV were misaligned, which caused
repeated problems
Consumer RH
when raising and lowering the
roof. The ACCC also relied on the evidence of Mr Murphy of Jayco Corp, who
in cross-examination accepted,
subject to some qualifications, that roof
misalignment was likely to be a manufacturing issue. In response, Jayco Corp
amongst other things, that the issues that arose with
Consumer RH
’s roof were minor, were easily fixed, and were
likely to have been caused by user error. Mr Manning, in particular, gave
to that effect.
is convenient to explain two elements of Jayco Corp’s response before
Consumer RH
’s concerns with her RV chronologically.
, Jayco Corp relied upon evidence to the effect that there is a
proper method for raising and lowering the roof of a pop top RV, and
that proper method is not followed, issues may arise with misalignment of the
roof to the body of the RV. Mr Charleson of
Jayco Newcastle gave evidence
Mr Charleson stated that
if the door to the RV is not clipped fully open
while both ends of the roof are lifted, then the lifting force creates a vacuum
the RV, which can damage the “easy lifters” and cause
misalignment of the roof when lowered. Mr Charleson also stated
requirement to clip the door open while lifting the roof is clearly stated in
the owner’s handbook provided to customers
who purchase a pop top RV. A
copy of the owner’s handbook provided to
Consumer RH
before the Court. Senior counsel for Jayco Corp did not put to
Consumer RH
in cross-examination that she had failed at any stage to
lift the roof in accordance with the guidance in the owner’s handbook.
Mr Charleson also gave evidence that it is not unusual for the roof of a
pop top RV to become misaligned if each side of the roof
is not pushed up evenly
during lifting. However, as I have mentioned, during cross-examination,
Mr Murphy gave evidence that misalignment
of a roof on a pop top RV was
likely caused by a manufacturing defect, and Mr Charleson agreed that it
could have been caused by
a manufacturing defect.
Jayco Corp relied upon evidence that even if there was a misalignment between
the body and the roof of
Consumer RH
’s RV, that would not have
Consumer RH
’s ability to raise the roof.
Mr Butcher gave evidence to that effect. Mr Butcher also gave evidence
Consumer RH
should have been able to lift the roof if she was
doing so correctly. However, Mr Charleson gave evidence that he believed
issues with the roof of
Consumer RH
’s RV were caused,
or at least contributed to, by her having difficulty lifting the roof on her own
due to her physical size.
Mr Butcher gave evidence to effect that this
issue may have been exacerbated by
Consumer RH
having purchased the
Outback model pop top RV, which had about 150 millimetres in extra height
compared to other models. Mr Wells,
a repair agent from Bundaberg Caravan
Repairs who attended to
Consumer RH
’s RV while she was away on a
trip, gave evidence that he observed
Consumer RH
struggling to raise
and lower the roof.
Consumer RH’s alleged initial concerns with the
Consumer RH
stated in her affidavit that after accepting delivery, she took her RV home and
inspected it more closely. She stated that she read
the owner’s handbook
and watched a YouTube video on how to raise the pop top roof. She stated that
she and her brother, whom
she described as a strong man, then attempted to raise
the roof of her RV, but struggled to get the front of the roof up.
Consumer RH
stated that two of the bows at the front of the roof had
broken, that there were small holes in the front of the skirt where the
had pierced it, and that the front of the skirt was hanging off the front of the
outside of the roof.
Consumer RH
also stated that the struts were
broken and the roof was crooked, such that it was not possible to get the roof
to stay up, and it
was also difficult to clip the roof down.
Consumer RH
also gave evidence about an independent problem, being
that water was not coming out of either of the two water tanks on the RV.
Consumer RH
stated that the following day, on 5 December 2014, she telephoned
Jayco Newcastle in order to discuss the issues with her RV. She
stated that she
first spoke to a man named “Mark”, whom she described as the Jayco
Newcastle sales manager. I infer that
Consumer RH
was referring to
Mr Mark Farrand of Jayco Newcastle, who did not give evidence.
Consumer RH
stated that she explained the issue with the roof of her
RV, and that Mr Farrand responded that it was typical to struggle with the
roof of pop tops.
Consumer RH
stated that she asked Mr Farrand
for a refund, and that he said, “No, let me put you onto the service
manager and they will
sort you out.”
Consumer RH
stated that
she was then passed on to Mr Warwick Butcher, who was the Jayco Newcastle
customer relations manager.
Consumer RH
stated that she asked
Mr Butcher for a refund, and he responded “No, we never do
Consumer RH
stated that Mr Butcher then booked her
RV in for repairs at Jayco Newcastle’s next available appointment, which
eight weeks later. None of this evidence was challenged in
cross-examination.
Mr Butcher stated in his affidavit that he did not recall having a
conversation with
Consumer RH
on 5 December 2014.
Mr Butcher also stated that it was highly unlikely that he would have
responded to a request for a replacement
by saying “No, we never do
that”, or anything of the sort. Further, Mr Butcher stated that he
did not recall booking
Consumer RH
’s RV in for repairs on
5 December 2014, and referred to a Jayco Newcastle repair order for
repairs that were conducted on
Consumer RH
20 February 2015, which he stated was dated
11 February 2015. Mr Butcher stated that generally, when a
customer called
up to book an RV in for repairs, he created a repair order
immediately, and that having regard to this practice, he believed that
the van in on 11 February 2015. There was not identified in the
evidence a document in the nature of a repair order dated
11 February 2015, but as discussed below there were entries in a
client communication summary that were dated 11 February 2015.
Corp produced a Jayco Newcastle client communication summary document, which was
extracted from Jayco Newcastle’s online
customer management system that
was used by staff to log their interactions with customers. The first entry on
the Client Communication
Summary document for
Consumer RH
entered by Mr Farrand at 5.47 pm on 8 December 2014, and
stated, “Spoke to [RH] and all is great with their van. They are
document are stated to record SMS mobile
telephone messages that were sent to
Consumer RH
in relation to upcoming repair work appointments at
Jayco Newcastle. The first message sent at 10.19 am on
11 February 2015 confirmed
an appointment that same day, the second
message sent about an hour later at 11.22 am on
11 February 2015 confirmed an appointment
on 20 February 2015,
and the third message sent two days later at 4.39 pm on
13 February 2015 was a reminder of an appointment on
19 February 2015. These messages were not explained in evidence,
however they provide some support for Mr Butcher’s account

Consumer RH’s

on 11 February 2015.
do have some reservations about the reliability of
Consumer RH
’s evidence, as I shall later explain. In relation
to her account of her conversations with employees of Jayco Newcastle, they
not sit well with the evidence in the form of Jayco Newcastle’s business
records, and Mr Butcher’s evidence of his
practice. But as I have
noted, she was not specifically challenged in cross-examination about these
conversations. Later events demonstrate
that there were misalignment and other
issues with the roof of her RV. But having regard to my reservations about the
reliability
Consumer RH
’s evidence, even though she was not
challenged in cross-examination about her evidence of the conversations of
5 December 2014
with employees of Jayco Newcastle, I am not persuaded
to accept her uncorroborated account of them.
February 2015 – Jayco Newcastle repair work
20 February 2015, Jayco Newcastle undertook repairs on
Consumer RH
’s RV. Jayco Newcastle produced a warranty claim
document, which set out the repair work that was performed. The warranty claim
document stated that the repair works required a total of 0.98 hours of labour
(inclusive of 0.5 hours attributed to an administration
fee), and that the cost
was $73.50 in labour and nothing in parts, for a total cost with GST of $80.85.
The warranty claim document
included 2 line items of repair works,
(1) an item that stated “Poor Fit” as the
reason, with the description “checking roof not coming down straight
(2) an administration fee.
Consumer RH
stated that when she took her RV to Jayco Newcastle for repairs in
February 2015, she raised her concerns about the roof and the
water tanks.
Mr Butcher stated that he met with
Consumer RH
when she brought
her RV into Jayco Newcastle for these repairs, and that he does not recall her
mentioning any issue with the water
tanks. Mr Butcher also stated that at
this service, Jayco Newcastle confirmed that the RV’s roof was not coming
down straight,
and that a repairman adjusted the roof. Finally, Mr Butcher
stated that
Consumer RH
told him that her partner had removed the
RV’s awning knobs and lost them, so Mr Butcher replaced the awning
knobs without
charging for his time. This was recorded in a tax invoice for
non-warranty works for a total $30.70, being the cost of the awning
Consumer RH
collected her RV on 23 February 2015. The
warranty claim was approved by Mr Manning on
26 February 2015.
March 2015 – Jayco Newcastle repair work
Consumer RH
stated in her affidavit that after the February 2015 repairs, she continued
to have problems lifting the roof of her RV because it
was not aligned
correctly, the front of the skirt still had holes from where the strut pierced
it, and the water was still not working.
Consumer RH
stated that she
took the caravan in for repairs about this time, but that she could not recall
when, and that Jayco Newcastle replaced
the water valve on the spot.
Consumer RH
was not challenged about this relatively minor aspect of
her evidence in cross-examination. In response, and as I have outlined above,
Mr Butcher stated that even if the RV’s roof was not aligned
correctly, that would not have affected
Consumer RH
to lift the roof, but only her ability to close it, and that she should have
been able to lift the roof if she was
doing it correctly.
18 March 2015,
Consumer RH
took her RV to Jayco Newcastle
for the routine service that had been scheduled when she took delivery of the RV
on 4 December 2014.
Jayco Newcastle produced a warranty claim
document, which set out the repair works conducted on
Consumer RH
’s RV. The warranty claim document stated that the
repair works required a total of 2.47 hours of labour (inclusive of 0.5 hours
attributed to an administration fee), and that the cost was $185.25 in labour
and $130 in parts, for a total cost with GST of $346.78.
The warranty claim
document included 5 line items of repair works, namely:
(1) an item that stated “Damaged” as the
reason, with the description “ REPAIR VINYL POP TOP O/S REAR STRUT –
SEE ASH/WB PLS CONFIRM POSITION checked strut mounts all identical, none
long[er] than others, roof mis alignment caused strut to
damage tent”;
(2) an item that stated “Damaged” as the reason, with the
description “Extra water tank factory fitted not reading

checked , wiring found no problems, found kinked in filter line that stoped
[sic] tank filling, fitted 90’barbed

(3) an item that stated “Poor Fit” as the reason, with the
description “Glue drawer faces back on used araldite
to glue screw anchors
back into drawer faces of the two drawers that come apart, them [sic] reassemble
both drawers”;
(4) an item that stated “Poor Fit” as the reason, with the
description “Check LEDs in awning some not working remove
clean glue from track– refit new light strip & check”; and
(5) an administration fee.
warranty claim was approved by Mr Manning on 30 March 2015.
Jayco Newcastle record of these Jayco warranty repair works included two
additional items, namely –
(1) an item titled “CHECK ROOF ALIGNMENT AND HOLD
DOWN CLIPS”, with the comment “appears good now”; and
(2) an item titled “Bowe found on floor”, with the comment
“filled out pink sheet”.
Newcastle also produced a tax invoice for non-Jayco warranty works, being the
replacement of a “water filler door catch”
and another replacement
of the awning knobs, for a total of $328.45.
Consumer RH
collected her RV on 23 March 2015. She stated in her affidavit that
when she collected her RV, she was told by someone in the service
department of
Jayco Newcastle, whose name she could not recall, that there was no need to
check the RV because the repairs had not
been done because paperwork had been
sent to Melbourne to authorise a new roof and skirt.
Consumer RH
stated that she was told to expect a telephone call notifying her to bring the
RV back to Jayco Newcastle when those parts had arrived.
She stated that about
four weeks later, she telephoned Mr Butcher to ask about her replacement
roof and skirt, and he responded with
words to the effect, “You must have
been mistaken, no paperwork has been sent. They would never give you a new roof
and skirt.”
In response to that evidence, Mr Butcher stated that
while he was not present when
Consumer RH
collected her RV on
23 March 2015, and therefore could not comment on what was said to
Consumer RH
at that time, he did know that the repair works were
completed as reflected in Jayco Newcastle’s records. Further,
stated that there was no indication that a new roof and skirt
were ordered for
Consumer RH
’s RV, or that any paperwork was
sent to Melbourne. Finally, Mr Butcher stated that when he next spoke to
Consumer RH
by telephone approximately four weeks later, she again
said that she was having issues with the roof, but Mr Butcher did not
her mentioning that she was expecting a new roof and skirt.
Mr Butcher stated that even if he did speak to
Consumer RH
would have said, “They would never give you
a new roof and skirt”,
as that simply was not the case.
my reservations about the reliability of
Consumer RH
evidence, and the absence of support in the Jayco Newcastle contemporaneous
business records, and the evidence of Mr Butcher,
I am not persuaded to
accept as a reliable recollection
Consumer RH
’s account that
she was advised by a representative of Jayco Newcastle that these repair works
had not been completed, and that
instead she was to receive a new roof and skirt
for her RV. However, I do note that
Consumer RH
’s account is
recorded in her email to Mr Manning sent on 4 May 2015, referred
April 2015 – Jayco Newcastle deferred repair work
Monday 20 April 2015,
Consumer RH
again took her RV to
Jayco Newcastle for repair works to be conducted.
Consumer RH
in her affidavit that she took her RV in for repairs again because the bows were
not re-installed properly, there were still
holes in the skirt, and there were
also lumps of white putty or silica in each corner of the roof to make it look
like the roof was
sitting straight.
Consumer RH
made no express mention
in her affidavit of any actual problems with the roof alignment in
April 2015. Mr Butcher and Mr Charleson
gave evidence of their
recollection that
Consumer RH
’s concern with her RV on this
occasion was limited to an issue with the bow pockets of the RV, into which the
bows are inserted
to give shape to the skirt when the roof is raised.
Mr Charleson stated that any fault with the bow pockets would not make the
unusable, nor would it require a major repair, but rather it would only
Consumer RH
to pay closer attention when lowering the roof
to ensure that the skirt was properly pushed inside the RV.
following day, on 21 April 2015, there was a severe storm in Newcastle
that resulted in Jayco Newcastle losing power and remaining
closed until Friday,
24 April 2015. Nonetheless, on that day,
Consumer RH
elected to collect her RV before any repair works could be completed. There are
no Jayco Newcastle records of
Consumer RH
’s RV going to the
dealership on this occasion.
May 2015 – Queensland trip and correspondence with Jayco
Corp and Jayco Newcastle
Consumer RH
took a trip to Queensland in her RV. I
would find it surprising if
Consumer RH
had embarked on this trip if she
was experiencing problems with the alignment of the roof of her RV which she
elected not to have
repaired. This tends to support the suggestion that the
concerns in April were confined to the bow pockets. Nonetheless, during that
trip, she encountered difficulties with the roof of her RV. These difficulties
led to two sets of repairs to the RV –
, repairs by
Mak’s Mechanical Onsite Caravan on 4 May 2015 at Crows Nest, and
, repairs by Bundaberg Caravan Repairs on 7 May 2015 at
Agnes Water. These difficulties also led
Consumer RH
to engage in
correspondence with Jayco Corp and Jayco Newcastle about her concerns with her
RV, which included her demanding a refund
or replacement. These demands were not
met. The witnesses who gave evidence about these events had limited recollection
sequence of the events, and provided some conflicting accounts. In
particular,
Consumer RH
’s evidence was confused and, in some
respects, contradicted by the evidence given by other witnesses and
contemporaneous records.
In the following sections, I have recorded the content
of correspondence and other contemporaneous records.
Roof issue and 4 May 2015 Mak’s Mechanical and Onsite
Caravan repair works
4 May 2015,
Consumer RH
encountered difficulties with the
roof of her RV while at a caravan park in Crows Nest in Queensland.
Consumer RH
stated that when she tried to put the roof down, she
could not secure it properly because it was not aligned with the body of the
caravan, and that one of the struts had broken.
Consumer RH
telephoned Mr Manning, who arranged for a repairman from Mak’s
Mechanical and Onsite Caravan Repairs to attend to fix the problem.
Consumer RH
stated that “a man and his son” attended,
and that they fixed the broken strut, so that she could get the roof down.
on 4 May 2015,
Consumer RH
sent an email to
Mr Manning in relation to her concerns with her RV and her dealings with
Jayco Newcastle, in which she relevantly
First I would like to thank you for sorting out my
breakdown issue this morning.
The repairer has replaced the screws that had broken off in the bracket in which
the left front strut goes.
I would like to make you aware officially if [sic] the serious other issues that
Jayco Newcastle failed to fix in March this year.
The van is only 4 months old today.
The van went in for service mid March and to fix several major problems
concerning the roof and skirt, namely 1. Re align crooked
roof. 2 – repair
holes on right front in skirt caused by the right front strut. 3 –
reinstall 3 bows that popped out
of skirt at front
Several days later I picked it up and was told no need to check anything because
he had done the paperwork and sent to Melbourne
to authorise a new roof and
skirt, I should expect a phone call to bring van down when these had arrived. I
waited in good faith
for 4 weeks – no contact so I rang and was asked to
take van down again so Warwick [Butcher] could look again. He said I must
been mistaken and that they would never give me new roof and skirt.
I have attached photos of the lumps of putty or silica that they put in each
corner of roof – I am sure you will agree with
me that this is an
appalling job!!!
And – the bows were not reinstalled and the holes in skirt I can see
daylight through them. It appears that they have painted
over them with a water
soluble substance that has now washed off in the rain.
I have no confidence in Jayco Newcastle to make goof [sic] these faults. They
have had amoeba tinc [sic] to fix them. I also gave
[sic] no confidence in the
pop top system. I spent almost 47k on this van in December and I am out of
patience. My partner has Alzheimer’s
disease and I need to do all the
caravan stuff on my own.
I request a full refund or a new replacement van of equivalent layout it can be
a tourer not outback.
I am lodging a complaint with fair trading nsw
5 May 2015, Mr Manning responded to
Consumer RH
relevantly as follows –
I am in warranty. So from Jayco I can approve warranty
repairs. I cannot help you with another van or money back. You have to go back
to the place you have your contract of sale with. That being Jayco Newcastle. I
cannot guarantee this will be the outcome for you
as the terms and conditions of
warranty are to repair van.
I’ll let you contact Jayco Newcastle about your
email correspondence between
Consumer RH
and Mr Manning was
forwarded to Jayco Newcastle.
same day, Mr Charleson sent an email to Mr Farrand, copied to
Mr Matthew O’Malley and Ms Paula Dudley of Jayco Newcastle,
relevantly as follows –
Mark [Farrand]
Can you please contact this lady
Paula [Dudley], can you please give a full outline of what has happened
forwarded Mr Charleson’s email to Mr Butcher. Then,
approximately ten minutes later, Ms Dudley sent an email to
Manning, in which she stated “Damian [Charleson] Asked me to ask
you, what repairs on this van have been completed by other
service agents, and
if so what did they do?” Mr Manning responded, “Only
3 claims as below”, and set out descriptions
of the items of warranty
work that had been submitted by Jayco Newcastle to Jayco Corp for works on
4 December 2014 (see [

Further roof issue and 7 May 2015 Bundaberg Caravan Repairs
repair works
5 May 2015,
Consumer RH
encountered further difficulties
with the roof of her RV while at a caravan park at Agnes Water, between
Bundaberg and Rockhampton
on the Queensland coast. In her affidavit,
Consumer RH
stated that she was unable to put the roof up as a few
of the struts on both sides of the RV had come out. She also stated that there
were holes in the skirt.
a result, later on 5 May 2015,
Consumer RH
sent a further
email to Mr Manning, in which she relevantly stated –

diagonally opposed roof clips can be closed now.
I rang roadside assistance who put me onto a business in Bundaberg however the
service manager there refused to send someone to help
So roof down now – this is an appalling situation I’m in only 3 days
into our 4 week holiday.
I would like a refund please OR a replacement van.
on 5 May 2015,
Consumer RH
also sent an email to the Jayco
Corp “info” account, in which she relevantly
I’m looking for the terms and conditions for
purchase of my van.
Could you email them to me please?
We broke down again today – roof again and another strut broken.
Not much of a holiday so far!!! Can’t get it fixed so
email was forwarded to Mr Charleson of Jayco Newcastle.
Consumer RH
the following day, relevantly as follows
I am sorry for this.
I can assist with allowing warranty repairs and approvals. I cannot offer you
your requests.
Your contract of sale is with your selling dealer. You would need to see them
go in that direction though
as terms and conditions of warranty is for repairs.
on the evening of 5 May 2015 and the morning of 6 May 2015,
Consumer RH
had raised the further difficulties that she was
having with the roof of her RV,
Consumer RH
and Mr Manning
exchanged a series of short emails, which relevantly included the following
exchanges –
Consumer RH
Ok Peter – so could you authorise a replacement roof and skirt/curtain?
That’s what I was told I was getting.
Perhaps re gassing all struts so they’re all same gas might help roof
Mr Manning –
I can’t until we get an assessment through stating it needs these things.
Then I need to ask management.
Consumer RH
Ok – we have 2 struts off – jayco roadside trying to find someone to
Mr Manning –
A local mechanic might be able to help
Consumer RH
Thank you peter Warwick [Butcher] is helping x
Mr Manning –
Mr Manning and Mr Butcher tried to make arrangements for a repair to
be conducted on
Consumer RH
’s RV on-site at Agnes Water.
Mr Butcher tried unsuccessfully to contact local repairers before arranging
for the caravan park
manager to assist
Consumer RH
to put the roof
down, and then for Jayco Mackay to fix the roof once
Consumer RH
to Mackay. Meanwhile, and unbeknownst to Mr Butcher, Mr Manning had
succeeded in arranging for a local repairman, Mr Barry Wells
from Bundaberg
Caravan Repairs, to attend the caravan park.
7 May 2015, Mr Wells attended the caravan park at Agnes Water to
fix the roof of
Consumer RH
’s RV. There was conflicting
evidence about what occurred during Mr Wells’s visit. During
cross-examination,
Consumer RH
’s evidence was confused and
inconsistent. Jayco Corp submitted that
Consumer RH
’s evidence
was not reliable, and that to the extent of any inconsistency, the Court should
prefer the largely consistent and
corroborated evidence of Mr Wells and
Mr Manning. As will become apparent, I find that
Consumer RH
’s evidence in relation to Mr Wells’s
visit was unreliable, and I prefer the evidence of Mr Wells and
Mr Manning.
Consumer RH
gave the following evidence in her affidavit about Mr Wells attending the
caravan park at Agnes Water to fix the roof of her RV.
Consumer RH
stated that Mr Wells told her that he could not fix the issue because her
RV needed a new roof.
Consumer RH
also stated that Mr Wells
temporarily repaired what he could so that she could get the roof down, but that
the roof was still not
sitting straight. She stated that Mr Wells took
photographs of her RV and sent them to Mr Manning, to whom Mr Wells
then spoke by
telephone. She stated that she heard Mr Wells tell
Mr Manning that the RV needed a new roof, and stated that Mr Wells
told her that
Mr Manning had said that he would authorise a new roof and
skirt for her RV.
Consumer RH
also stated that after that, she
telephoned Mr Manning and requested a replacement RV, to which he responded
something to the effect
of “no, we don’t do that”, and told
her to take her RV to Jayco Newcastle so that they could replace the roof.
Consumer RH
also stated that next she spoke by telephone with
Mr Butcher, who told her that she would not get a replacement RV or a new
Consumer RH
stated that a man at the caravan park had
to tie down the roof of her RV, because it would not clip down properly, so that
drive it home.
cross-examination,
Consumer RH
referred to Mr Wells on a few
occasions as “Mr Barry”. She stated that she thought that
Mr Wells attended with his son,
whom she described as an apprentice, and
stated that they both examined the RV. As I have mentioned above at [
Consumer RH
her affidavit that the repairman who had earlier attended the site at Crows Nest
attended with his son. Mr Wells stated
in evidence-in-chief that he
attended the site at Agnes Water with his wife, who spoke to
Consumer RH
and her partner. He repeated this in cross-examination, and was not
challenged about this evidence.
Consumer RH
gave evidence that the RV was on “flat” or “flat-ish”
ground at the caravan park, and referred to a spirit
level that she claimed was
in the RV, but that was not referred to in her affidavit. She gave unclear
evidence about whether the
roof was up or down when Mr Wells arrived, and
whether the issue was that she could not get it up or down. She gave evidence
Mr Wells had difficulty getting the roof up and down.
Consumer RH
stated that she did not recall Mr Wells telling her
that he could not assess the problem with the roof because the RV was not on
flat ground. She also gave evidence that in addition to Mr Wells taking
photographs, she also took photographs of her RV during Mr
visit, but that those photographs would not be in existence now because
“the camera is thrown out, it’s
just natural wear and tear”,
and she did not download the photographs. Finally,
Consumer RH
evidence that when Mr Wells telephoned Mr Manning, he used the
speakerphone function on his mobile telephone, and she joined
a three-way
telephone conversation during which Mr Manning committed to replacing her
RV’s roof and skirt. This account was
materially different to the account
in her affidavit, in which she said that Mr Wells conveyed
Mr Manning’s agreement to replace
the roof and the skirt.
Consumer RH
referred to Mr Manning’s alleged commitment
to replace the roof and skirt of her RV in later correspondence, as detailed
stated in his affidavit that when he arrived at the caravan park,
Consumer RH
told him that she could not get the roof of her RV down
because it was misaligned. He stated that the RV was sitting on quite uneven
ground and its roof was up. Mr Wells stated that he changed the struts,
which was a relatively minor job, and that he was able to
put the roof up and
down, but that
Consumer RH
appeared to struggle with that task.
After Mr Wells changed the struts, three of the four corner brackets for
the roof struts were
lined up, but the offside corner bracket was slightly out
of alignment. Mr Wells left the roof of the RV up because
Consumer RH
and her partner were staying at the caravan park.
Mr Wells stated that he considered that the problem with misalignment of
and roof of the RV may have been caused by the RV being on uneven
ground, but that it could not be definitively assessed until the
RV was on flat
ground. When Mr Wells was cross-examined, he agreed that he had no
independent recollection of the RV being on uneven
ground, but believed that it
was because the caravan park at which it was sited had uneven ground.
Mr Wells made suggestions for
further investigation to be undertaken on
flat ground in the warranty claim document that he produced, as detailed at [
] below. Mr Wells stated that he
spoke to Mr Manning while at the caravan park. In his affidavit and during
cross-examination, Mr
Wells was unequivocal in his recollection that he did
not advise Mr Manning that the roof of the RV needed to be replaced, and
Mr Manning did not tell him that the RV’s roof would be
replaced. However, in his affidavit he accepted that it was possible
Consumer RH
that one possibility might be that her RV needed a
new roof. He stated that it was his usual practice to say that such an issue
needed to be assessed on flat ground.
cross-examination, Mr Wells came across as experienced and knowledgeable in
his area. In comparison to
Consumer RH
’s confused
presentation, he gave evidence in a straight-forward fashion. Mr Wells
disputed that he had a three-way telephone
conversation on speakerphone with
Consumer RH
and Mr Manning. Mr Wells stated that he walked
Consumer RH
when he telephoned Mr Manning, and that
his practice was never to speak to Jayco while a customer was within earshot.
This account
is supported by an email sent by Mr Wells about two months
later, as detailed at [
below. In relation to
Consumer RH
’s evidence that she had a
spirit level on her RV, Mr Wells stated that he did not see it, and that if
it was at the front of
the RV, as was put, it would be no good, as the spirit
level needed to be in the body of the RV.
stated that while he did not recall the specifics of any conversation with
Mr Wells or
Consumer RH
, he absolutely denied that he approved
a new roof for
Consumer RH
’s RV. Mr Manning’s
strong denial of
Consumer RH
’s account that he committed to
replacing the roof and skirt of her RV is also reflected in an email that he
sent on 11 May
2015, set out at [
] below. Mr Manning stated that
he believed at the time that
Consumer RH
’s roof was easily
repairable and that the faults that were occurring were likely due to user
error. Further, Mr Manning gave
evidence that the cost of a replacement
roof and skirt would have exceeded his authority limit, so he could not have
approved it
without Mr Morgan or Mr Austin making an assessment as to
whether it was required.
produced a handwritten warranty claim document dated 7 May 2015, which
set out the repair works performed on
Consumer RH
claim was for 5 hours of labour at a total cost with GST of $330. The claim
included the following description of
the works –
Location: 1770 Agnes Waters
Try to realign roof and refit gas struts
Requires further investigation
Section Requires Replacement
or Roof not produced square
not satisfactory
cross-examination, Mr Wells explained that his descriptions of work in this
document were to be understood as recording his
recommendation that further
investigation was required as to
the tent (or skirt) required
replacement,
the body or roof was not produced square, or
the alignment was not satisfactory. Mr Wells gave evidence
that he did not form any preliminary view on those issues, but rather that
recommended that they be further investigated on a flat concrete floor in a
workshop. I have considered the terms of the warranty
claim document in the
context of the surrounding circumstances, and I accept Mr Wells’s
evidence that he recommended further
investigation.
sent an email to Mr Butcher on 7 July 2015, in response to a
request for further details, providing his account of his attendance
Consumer RH
’s caravan, relevantly stating as
Service call to 1770 caravan park re. Jayco pop top
problem and found with the gas struts binding and detaching moved gas strut
forward on both sides, found roof margines [sic] out, called peter
manning to report problem from the opposite side of van than where
customer was
standing and was told to refer customer to a service agent where they bought the
van or other agent if not confident
with Newcastle but customer was advised that
further investigation must be performed before any [decision] could be made on
repairs under warranty
note; further investigation must be performed before any [decision] can be
customer was informed and understood this before I left the site,
peter manning did not agree to renew any parts until investigation was complete
and submitted to JAYCO.
HOPE THIS MAKES IT MORE CLEAR
the basis of all of the evidence about Mr Wells’s visit to the Agnes
Water caravan park, set out above and below, I find
that Mr Wells did not
Consumer RH
or Jayco Corp that
Consumer RH
’s RV required a replacement roof and skirt, I also
find that Mr Manning did not commit to replacing the roof and skirt on the
RV, and finally I find that neither Mr Manning nor Mr Wells stated
anything to this effect to
Consumer RH
May 2015 – further correspondence with Jayco Newcastle
and Jayco Corp
8 May 2015, Mr Butcher sent an email to Jayco Mackay in relation
Consumer RH
’s RV, in which he relevantly
Just spoke to [
Consumer RH
]. Apparently she
left a message for me that I did not get.
Barry from Bundaberg caravan repairs came out to her and refixed the struts and
moved the mounts.
He also has spoken to Peter Manning and apparently a new roof and skirt has been
approved so I will follow that up.
Whilst she is still having difficulty lifting the roof all appears OK at this
She will contact me if she needs any further assistance.
Thanks for offering to assist but at this stage may be all
on 8 May 2015, Mr Butcher sent another email to
Mr Charleson, copied to Mr Farrand and Mr Manning, in which he
relevantly stated
All is Ok and we are speaking to her
Consumer RH
] when she returns about changing the van.
Have spent a lot of time trying to get a local person to assist [
] without success so arranged for the park manager to assist her to put
roof down. Arranged with Chris at Mackay to fix roof for her
when she gets there
next week. Rang [
Consumer RH
] but she had left a message with
Danielle that I did not get that Barry from Bundaberg Caravan Repairs came out
and fixed the struts
and spoke to Peter Manning and apparently a new roof and
tent has been authorised. Warwick will speak to Peter on
on 8 May 2015,
Consumer RH
sent an email to
Mr Manning, in which she relevantly stated –
Had a call from Barry today who relayed that you want
central coast caravans Tuggerah to organise the roof etc.
Well I rang and spoke to Cameron, gave him the [chassis] number and he said
he’d get back to me that was hours ago. Did he
ring and speak to you?
Meanwhile I had a call from Warwick at Newcastle branch and he’s going to
ring you Monday about it!
I’m thinking that Cameron may not want the job?
Thanks for your help and Barry was terrific.
We are cutting short our trip and returning home by 30 May
Might try again for cairns when all is fixed
10 May 2015,
Consumer RH
sent a further email to
Mr Manning, in which she relevantly stated –
I have attached pics of the water dripping down through
the closed hatch – no rain it was probably from roof and aircon.
My patience has expired – we’ve had to cut our holiday very much
short all because of this faulty van roof and curtain
that we have used only
Barry rang you last Thursday with his view that the roof was faulty in the
building process.
Could you please talk to someone down where you are who can authorise a refund
or replacement of equal value. Is it Chris someone?
Already 5 months of the warranty has expired and who knows how long we’ll
be without a van for everything to be fixed.
My life is hard enough looking after Eddie who has Alzheimer’s disease
without this happening.
The van has been in to Newcastle already for roof and curtain fix last March and
you know that outcome.
So can we work together to fix this please? Could you please ring tomorrow or
I’ll ring you. I feel like bringing the van to
Victoria and leaving it
there. 47k down the drain.
following morning, on 11 May 2015, Mr Manning responded to
Consumer RH
, relevantly as follows –
I am sorry for the troubles. Your request of a refund or
replacement van needs to go through your selling dealer as they have you
contract of sale. I can only authorise repairs from Jayco
on 11 May 2015,
Consumer RH
also attempted to send an
email to Mr Charleson of Jayco Newcastle, with the subject line
“Major problems journey outback s57143
sale date 4/12/2014”.
Mr Charleson stated that he did not receive the email at that time, because
his email address was not
spelled correctly by
Consumer RH
the email chain in evidence records that it was forwarded to Mr Farrand and
Mr Butcher of Jayco Newcastle. In the email,
Consumer RH
relevantly stated –
I am writing to you about the difficulties I have had
and continue to have with the roof, struts and water leaks in the above van
purchased new on the date above cost 47k.
We picked up the van on 4/12/2014. Peter showed us how things worked in general.
We took the van home and opened it up to show my
family. When putting roof down
2 bows came out and the skirt was hanging out the front of the roof AND there
were small holes on
the right front skirt where the strut had pierced it.
The earliest appointment I was given by suit service crew to look at it was
18/3/2015 some 3 ½ months later.
Son [sic] I took van down 18/3/15 for the roof and struts and holes to be
repaired and left it their [sic] for more than a week.
On picking it up I asked to see the repairs and was told don’t worry no
need to do so because the “paperwork had been
completed and sent to
Melbourne to order a new roof and skirt. We will ring you when it all
arrives”. I waited in good faith
for 4 weeks then rang Warwick about it.
He said “we’d never give you a new roof and skirt. Bring it
downagainand [sic]
I’ll look at it. This was now April 2015 Warwick
took it and said he’d get itallrepaired [sic].
I picked it up late April because we had a trip planned – the promised
vinyl repair not done and roof has lumps of something
under each corner
supposedly to align it!!
We left for trip up north on 2/5/2015. Next morning roof wouldn’t close,
clips not closing, one and a strut broke.
Called Jayco road service the next day from and fellow came out and fixed
Next morning roof not seal and 2 other struts out and could only close 2 pop top
Called Jayco coronas [sic] service again from North Bundaberg area the next day
(4/5/15) no one come [sic] out until 3 days later.
Struts fixed again struts re
gassed by Barry wells who rang Peter manning and sent him photos and recommended
a new roof to replace
the other which was in his view a building fault.
I also have sent Peter photos of everything. Barry said peter authorised new
roof and skirt.and-
Last night we had water running through aircon and hatch side although no rain.
I suspect we now have water inside roof.
I discoveredthismorning [sic] that Peter manning has not authorised a new roof
etc. Ihave [sic] spoken to Mark f this morning about
swapping this van for a new
van of equal value.
I have already waited 5.5 mths of the warranty and am being shuffled from person
to person and getting different stories.
I ask that you come back to me within 24 hours with a solution that is mutually
acceptable.
I am a 62 yr woman caring for my partner who has Alzheimer’s –
travelling on our own with a finite time left.
I have photos as does Warwick mark and Peter manning
on 11 May 2015, Mr Butcher sent an email to Mr Manning,
copied to Mr Farrand, in which he relevantly stated –
I just spoke to our sales manager Mark Farrand to let
him know what we had discussed and he said [
Consumer RH
] had rung him
this morning.
Consumer RH
] said she had spoken to you this morning and you authorised
a roof and tent. She also said she wants a full height starcraft as an
or her money back.
She said that you said we would arrange that at Newcastle.
Can you please ring me before I call her.
on 11 May 2015, Mr Manning responded to Mr Butcher,
relevantly stating –
I have not spoken to her today. I sent an email this
morning but at no stage did I say she was getting a new roof and
still on 11 May 2015, Mr Manning exchanged a series of emails
with Central Coast Caravans in relation to potential repairs to
be conducted on
Consumer RH
’s RV, which relevantly included the following
exchanges –
Central Coast Caravans –
I have just been speaking to [
Consumer RH
], they have a new
Discovery, they are on holidays at the moment in Qld and have had quite a bit of
trouble with the Roof Struts (1
fell off and then the other ones fell off at a
later date) She has indicated that someone has rung yourself and reported the
and that the van requires a new Roof and Vinyl skirt (Jayco Newcastle
have repaired the skirt, customer is not happy with the result)
would you be
able to advise if this work has been authorized?
Mr Manning –
Its [sic] needs to be inspected first. I have not said we would put a new roof
on. I said if we have to we will.
I don’t think it needs one myself.
Please report to us first with quote and pictures if it needs a new roof.
She has been in contact with Jayco Newcastle as well. Maybe someone there said
this but Jayco makes the decisions. Not Newcastle.
Central Coast Caravans –
I will give her a call and ask them to bring the van here for
inspection.
on 11 May 2015, Mr Butcher made an entry into the Jayco Newcastle
online customer management system, which is recorded in
the Client Communication
Summary document as follows –
Warwick [Butcher] spoke to Peter [Manning] and a roof
and tent have not been authorised. Peter [Manning] sent an email to [
Spoke to Barry [Wells] at Bundaberg Caravan repairs. He moved the front strut
mounts on the roof to stop them coming off. He also
advised the roof or van is
out of square and he adjusted as best he could. Warwick [Butcher] rang
Consumer RH
] as she had spoken to Mark [Farrand] this morning wanting a
refund or new starcraft 16ft full height van clean swap. [
Consumer RH
said Fair Trading will order a refund. I assured her that is not the case.
Warwick [Butcher] advised [
Consumer RH
] a refund will not happen. She
will need to discuss with Mark [Farrand] a trade in price compared to a new one.
Consumer RH

(her problem not ours) but she expects some goodwill to make a clean swap.
Consumer RH
] also told Barry [Wells] that she does not want to deal
with us Peter [Manning] suggested she goes to Central Coast
12 May 2015, Mr Butcher sent an email to Mr Charleson,
copied to Mr Farrand, in which he relevantly stated –
Had a long discussion with [
Consumer RH
again late yesterday.
She is all over the place with statements she has been told which have been
denied. Eg says Peter M approved roof to Bundaberg repairer
but repairer and
Pete say no etc.
Consumer RH
] the van needs to come here and I will have an answer
for her in 24 hours. (I believe from discussion with Repairer that a roof and
tent will be authorized.
Consumer RH
] told the repairer she does not have confidence in
us Peter did refer her to Central Coast Caravans.
I believe the van is usable now but [
Consumer RH
] has difficulty
with the roof.
Consumer RH
] told me she has lodged a complaint with Fair Trading
and it will cost us $3000. I explained to her what happens via Fair Trading.
Consumer RH
] explains that as her partner has sever[e] Dementure and she
is trying to give her a quality of life while she can enjoy it and needs
usable van.
Consumer RH
]’s other request is to change the van (17.55-9JY)
for a 16.51-3 stock van at no cost to her.
Expects our goodwill and her inconvenience to cover this.
I have explained that we will certainly do the very best we can for her but that
I expect there will be a changeover cost to her
as her van is now a used van and
would be traded in.
Consumer RH
] has asked for Mark [Farrand] to contact her with a
proposition.
Consumer RH
] goes to Central Coast Caravans for the roof repair
she is going to be waiting for quite some time for a roof. We would not trade
the van pending their repair.
She has already rung Coffs and was told the 16.51-3 is $48000 and she paid
$46233 for the Journey.
Fair Trading should not be an issue.
Consumer RH
] goes to another dealer I assume the changeover
would be greater than our offer.
Consumer RH
] has been very difficult I think we need to be
as proactive as possible in helping her.
Can Mark contact [
Consumer RH
] today with a deal and then I can
possibly arrange to get her van in for the roof issue. She is still in Qld at
the moment but can
come back anytime.
Mr Charleson
responded to Mr Butcher, copied to Mr Farrand and Mr Manning,
relevantly as follows –
As discussed Warwick, please draft an email and show
Mark and myself before you send. We need to get our position down which
The van is repairable and will be repaired
The van is useable and is not stopping her doing what she wants in using
She has stated to you that she is struggling in putting up the roof and
this is one of the reasons she wants to change vans
She has stated that she has lost confidence in us from a repair point of
view but she has not given us fair and reasonable opportunity
The van was here to be fixed a few weeks ago. [
Consumer RH
called after the storms and said she needed it back urgently for use because of
the storms. She said it was ok if the work had not
been done to it
We have not seen the van since and now she is becoming hostile.
(don’t use these words but something similar)
We will trade the van in and give her a changeover price. We will not be
buying the van back at full price or swapping it with another
requested, Mr Butcher prepared a draft email to
Consumer RH
which he sent to Mr Charleson and Mr Farrand for their review and
comments. Mr Charleson responded, “Excellent, please copy
manning. Do not copy me in, get Mark [Farrand] involved if you need to”.
Then, still on 12 May 2015, Mr Butcher sent
that email to
Consumer RH
, copied to Mr Manning and Mr Farrand as
requested. The email contained a formatting error, so Mr Butcher re-sent it
without that
Consumer RH
’s request. The email
relevantly stated –
Further to our phone conversation late yesterday I need
to confirm the following:
Your van is repairable and will be repaired. I
need your van here ASAP to report to Peter Manning and will have an answer
24 hours if the roof and tent is to be replaced.
Following the repair by Bundaberg Caravan Repairs the van is useable. If
and only if the roof and tent is to be replaced it could
take 10 weeks for them
to arrive here.
You have confirmed that you are struggling to raise and lower the roof and
that is the main reason for wanting to change vans.
The van was here a few weeks ago and I am advised you called and wanted the
van back urgently. You said it was OK if all the work
had not been
We have not seen the van since you picked it up and you have mentioned to
the Bundaberg repairer that you have lost confidence in
us from a repair point
of view, but we feel that we have not been given a fair and reasonable time to
fix the problems that have
arisen since.
You first raised the issue of roof alignment when the van came in on
20/2/2015 and it was adjusted. When you brought the van in for
warranty items on 18/3/15, I particularly noted on our repair Order with you
that the roof now appears good. This was
also printed on your copy of the Repair
Order you received when picking the van up on 23/3/15.
You have advised that you have lodged a complaint with Fair Trading and I
do not understand why you suggest it will cost us $3000.
I do not accept that we are not being responsive to you. I have personally
gone out of my way to assist you, left many messages for
you and been honest
with you in all discussions notwithstanding that you suggest that I do not have
the authority or skills to deal
with your issues.
We will trade the van in and give you a changeover price, but will not be
buying it back at full price or swapping it for another
Please confirm when you can bring the van in to Jayco
Newcastle for assessment and discussion on changeover. If the van needs to stay
overnight we will deliver the van back to you.
13 May 2015,
Consumer RH
responded to Mr Butcher,
copied to Mr Farrand and Mr Manning, relevantly as
As you know we broke down the first and second times on
days, respectively of our 1 month booked
holiday up to North Queensland.
We have had to cancel 2 of those bookings and wear the cost. Instead we are
staying in 1 caravan park for the rest of our holiday
so we won’t break
down again. We are pensioners.
I will be in touch in a week or two.
on 13 May 2015, Mr Butcher responded to
Consumer RH
copied only to Mr Manning, relevantly as follows –
Thanks for reply. As mentioned any warranty work
authorized by the factory will be carried out for you.
Please let me know if you are coming in for warranty assessment and to discuss
changing to a different model van.
Please both enjoy the rest of your holidays.
Mid-2015 – Fair Trading complaint
Consumer RH
lodged a complaint against Jayco
Newcastle with the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading. Mr Charleson
authorised Mr Butcher to
Consumer RH
’s complaint
on behalf of Jayco Newcastle.
Consumer RH,
and Mr Butcher and Mr Farrand
on behalf of Jayco Newcastle, attended a conciliation conference at the New
South Wales Civil and Administrative
Tribunal to seek to resolve
Consumer RH
’s complaint. There is a document that appears to
have been prepared by Jayco Newcastle ahead of that conference, which the
to the court book filed in this proceeding refers to as “Notes for

10 July 2015 – Consumer RH traded in her RV to Jayco

agreement for

Newcastle provided
Consumer RH
with a trade-in allowance for her RV

Consumer RH
emphatically denied that she received $1,490 from Jayco

find that the RV that Jayco Newcastle supplied to
Consumer RH
not of acceptable quality owing principally to the problems that existed with
the lifting mechanism for the pop top which led
to misalignment, difficulties in
raising and lowering the roof, holes in the skirt section, problems with the
bows, and an inability
to clip the roof down correctly for towing. In addition,
there was an apparently unrelated problem that the water tanks did not operate
correctly. As I have mentioned,

problems that she observed upon taking delivery of the RV was not challenged in
cross-examination, and I accept
her evidence of the broad nature of the
problems, as it was consistent with the later records of repairs that were

that Jayco Newcastle, Mr Wells or Mr Manning informed her

misinterpreted. It is also apparent that there must have been some
misunderstanding between

Jayco Newcastle to whom she spoke when she picked up her RV on
23 March 2015. I doubt that she was told
on that occasion that the
repairs had not been done, or that a replacement roof and skirt were to be
ordered from Melbourne.
Nonetheless,
there were problems with the roof. The problems were such that they caused tears
in the skirt. Jayco Newcastle attempted
repairs or adjustments in both February
and March 2015, as the warranty claim documents record. The later
attendances of the two
repair agents on site on 4 and 7 May 2015
to address problems with the roof mechanism, are capable of supporting an
inference of

were likely to have been caused by user error and, in

the roof mechanism and related issues, were caused
by user error. It was not put

set up on uneven ground at the site at Agnes Water, it was not put that the RV
was not level. And any failure
of the RV to be level was not suggested as a
reason for the earlier problem at Crows Nest, or the initial difficulties
experienced
upon taking delivery.

stated in cross-examination that when the RV was traded, it
wasn’t bad, and that all that was required was some adjustment.
Mr Wells stated that in his time as a caravan repairer, he was frequently
called out for misaligned pop tops, which was a frequent
and minor issue. In
cross-examination, Mr Wells resisted suggestions that misaligned pop tops
were caused by manufacturing defects.
However, this has to be reconciled with
the suggestions that he made on the warranty claim form, which included to
investigate whether
“body or roof not produced square” (see [
the other hand, there was evidence that pointed to the possibility that the
defect was a manufacturing defect that had the consequence
that the alignment of
the roof could never be permanently resolved. Mr Murphy, who was retired at
the time of giving evidence, had
been the research and development manager of
Jayco Corp at the relevant time, and had worked there for 40 years. He
presented as
being an honest and reliable witness. Mr Murphy was taken to
an email dated 10 March 2014 from Jayco Mackay to Jayco Corp in which
Jayco Corp’s attention was drawn to a Starcraft pop top that had been
delivered to the dealership and which had a misaligned
roof. The dealer stated
that it did not happen to every pop top, but that it did happen from time to
time. Mr Murphy agreed that
the Starcraft and the Journey pop top had the
same roof mechanism. Mr Murphy stated that roof misalignment was not a big
which he meant that there were not large numbers of misalignment cases
to his knowledge. He agreed that putting aside misalignment
caused by the
fitment of post-manufacture options, that a roof misalignment was more likely to
be a manufacturing issue. There was
also evidence of other dealers reporting
issues on an online dealers’ forum in March and November 2015
relating to the alignment
of roofs in Jayco pop tops. One dealer expressed the
opinion that he believed that it was a design issue, and that the roofs were
heavy for the “easylift system”. However, the nature of these
suggested defects, and any necessary remedies, were
not explored with
Mr Murphy who was not cross-examined beyond his acceptance that if there
was a roof misalignment upon delivery
of an RV, then there would likely be a
manufacturing issue. And Mr Murphy was not challenged about his evidence in
cross-examination
that misalignment of roofs was not to his knowledge a major
issue in terms of numbers.
the case of
Consumer RH
’s RV, in February 2015, Jayco
Newcastle determined that the roof was not coming down straight, and I find that
the misalignment
had caused damage to the skirt. The roof later became
misaligned again when
Consumer RH
was travelling in May 2015.
Consumer RH
traded in the RV, the roof was adjusted in
July 2015 and it became misaligned again in November 2016. I do not
place any weight on
the November 2016 misalignment, because there was
insufficient evidence about the circumstances of its occurrence.
question whether the roof misalignment or the other issues that
Consumer RH
experienced were manufacturing defects that constituted
a major failure would require that account be taken of the cause of the
and whether, and if so how, those problems might be rectified. That is
because the nature of the failure would need to be evaluated
in order to
determine for the purposes of s 260(a) of the ACL whether the reasonable
consumer would not have purchased the RV, and
in order to determine for the
purposes of s 260(c) whether the RV could easily and within a reasonable
time be made fit for purpose.
There is insufficient evidence to sustain a claim
that defects with the water tanks or the air-conditioning themselves constituted
a major failure. The focus of the ACCC’s case was on the roof mechanism.
say that there was a manufacturing defect with the roof mechanism leaves one to
speculate about what the defect relating to the
roof mechanism was, and what, if
any, course of action was open to rectify the defect. If this was a claim
advanced by a consumer,
one would normally expect a report from a person
qualified to assess the RV, which identified the nature of the fault. In this
the ACCC has not adduced evidence of this type. Following the incidents on
4 and 7 May 2015,
Consumer RH
did not take the RV to
the dealer to have the matter assessed prior to trading it in. Upon trading it
in, the evidence is that all
that was required by Jayco Newcastle was some
adjustment before re-sale. The possibility that only some adjustment was
is supported by the evidence of Mr Wells that the need for
adjustment was frequent and minor, and the evidence of Mr Butcher who
that struts and alignment issues could be easily repaired. There was also a
flavour in the evidence of
Consumer RH
that one of her main
grievances was that a pop top RV was never suitable for her circumstances, which
was a specific purpose that
she had made known to Jayco Newcastle prior to
purchase. This would not necessarily amount to a manufacturing defect
constituting
a major failure for which Jayco Corp was responsible. In this state
of the evidence, I am left to speculate about whether there was
a manufacturing
defect that constituted a major failure to comply with the statutory guarantees
of acceptable quality, fitness for
purpose, or departure in a substantial
respect from a demonstration model. In the circumstances, the evidence does not
an affirmative state of satisfaction on this question, and I am
therefore not persuaded to find that there was a major failure that

Part 8: Alleged contraventions of ss 18(1) and 29(1)(m) of
the Australian Consumer Law
I have stated earlier, the ACCC alleges that Jayco Corp engaged in misleading or
deceptive conduct, and made false or misleading
representations, towards the
Consumers in contravention of ss 18 and 29(1)(m) of the ACL. The text of
those provisions is set out
in full at [
The operation of ss 18 and 29(1)(m) of the ACL
18 provides that a person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that
is misleading or deceptive, or is likely
to mislead or deceive. Section 29(1)(m)
relevantly provides that a person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection
supply or possible supply or goods or services, make a false or
misleading representation concerning the existence, exclusion, or
effect of any
condition, warranty, guarantee, right or remedy (including the statutory
consumer guarantees contained in Division
1 of Part 3-2 of the ACL, discussed
above). The ACCC did not seek to rely on s 4(1) of the ACL, which deals
with misleading representations
as to future matters: see,
Competition and Consumer Commission v Woolworths Group Limited
[2020] FCAFC
(Foster, Wigney and Jackson JJ).
general prohibition in s 18 of the ACL has its origins in
Trade Practices Act
, which included a similar prohibition on misleading
or deceptive conduct. The authorities that considered that section and developed
the organising principles for its application remain relevant in considering
of the ACL. The explanatory memorandum for the Bill which introduced
the ACL stated that the “jurisprudence associated with
the understanding
and interpretation of
still relevant”: explanatory
memorandum to the
Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill
(No 2) 2010
(Cth) at [3.4].
18 of the ACL, and its predecessor in
Trade Practices
, have been the subject of extensive judicial consideration on many
occasions. More than a decade ago, French CJ and Kiefel J in
& Associates Insurance Broking Pty Ltd v BMW Australia Finance Limited
[2010] HCA 31
241 CLR 357
Miller v BMW
) at [5] observed that
“the cause of action for contravention of statutory prohibitions against
conduct in trade or commerce
that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to
mislead or deceive has become a staple of civil litigation in Australian courts
all levels.” That trend has continued. In this proceeding, the parties
did not dispute the principles that inform the scope
and content of the
prohibition in
of the ACL. The relevant principles may be summarised
as follows.
relation to the scope of the prohibition,
applies to a person’s
conduct “in trade or commerce”: see,
Concrete Constructions (NSW)
Pty Ltd v Nelson
[1990] HCA 17
169 CLR 594.
The question whether the
alleged conduct was in trade or commerce was not in issue in this proceeding.
Nor was there any dispute
as to any limits arising from the words “engage
in conduct” adopted in the statutory text. Those words are of wide import,
and further,
of the ACL makes clear that “engaging in
conduct” captures “doing or refusing to do any act”. In this
the circumstances in which a person’s silence may amount to
misleading or deceptive conduct have been the subject of particular
attention: see,
Miller v BMW
at [20]-[23] (French CJ and
relation to the content of the prohibition,
of the ACL proscribes
conduct that is either misleading or deceptive, or is likely to mislead or
deceive. The question whether conduct
is misleading or deceptive, or is likely
to be so, is an objective question of fact that the court must determine for

Heydon and Kiefel JJ), citing the dissenting reasons of McHugh J in
Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd
[2004] HCA 60
218 CLR 592
Butcher v Lachlan Elder
) at [109]. While the words
“misleading or deceptive” have been said to be clear and
unambiguous, albeit tautologous to
a degree, difficulties may arise in applying
the general precept framed in abstract terms to the facts of a particular case:
Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd
[1982] HCA 44
Parkdale v Puxu
) at 197 (Gibbs CJ).
central question is whether the impugned conduct, viewed as a whole, has a
sufficient tendency to lead a person exposed to the
conduct into error, that is,
to form an erroneous assumption or conclusion about some fact or matter:
Parkdale v Puxu
at 198 (Gibbs CJ);
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v TPG Internet Pty Ltd
[2013] HCA 54
250 CLR 640
) at [39] (French CJ, Crennan, Bell and Keane JJ);
Competition and Consumer Commission v TPG Internet Pty Ltd
[2020] FCAFC 130
ACCC v TPG FCAFC
) at [22] (Wigney, O’Bryan and Jackson JJ).
Conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a real and not remote
possibility
of it doing so, regardless of whether it is less or more than a 50
per cent chance:
Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd
[1984] FCA 67
Global Sportsman v Mirror
) at 87 (Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ);
Lachlan Elder
at [112] (McHugh J);
ACCC v TPG FCAFC
at [22(a)]. It is
not sufficient if the conduct merely has a sufficient tendency to cause
confusion or wonderment:
Parkdale v Puxu
at 198 (Gibbs CJ) and 209-210
Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited
[2000] HCA 12

Google Inc v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
[2013] HCA 1
; 259 CLR 435 (
Google v ACCC
) at [8] (French CJ,
Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
focus of the enquiry is on the impugned conduct. The court must determine
whether it was misleading or deceptive, or
mislead or deceive.
The words “likely to” underscore that that the test is objective and
that the impugned conduct can
be assessed prospectively. It is not necessary to
prove an intention to mislead or deceive, nor is it necessary to prove that the
conduct in question in fact misled or deceived anyone:
Parkdale v Puxu
197 (Gibbs CJ);
Google v ACCC
at [6] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
While evidence that someone was in fact misled or deceived is admissible, and
may be probative,
it is not essential and it does not itself establish
contravention of the prohibition:
Global Sportsman v Mirror Newspapers
ACCC v TPG FCAFC
at [22(c)]. Further, in certain circumstances,
conduct may be found to be misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or
even where the persons to whom the conduct was directed were not in
fact misled or deceived:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v LG
Electronics Australia Pty Ltd
[2018] FCAFC 96
, [54] and [64]
(Allsop CJ, Jagot and Lee JJ); cf,
Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission v Valve Corporation (No 3)
[2016] FCA 196
337 ALR 647
(Edelman J).
impugned conduct must be viewed as a whole in all of the circumstances:
Parkdale v Puxu
at 199 (Gibbs CJ);
Butcher v Lachlan Elder
(Gleeson, Hayne and Heydon JJ). It invites error to look at isolated parts of a
person’s conduct, without considering
their effect in the whole course of
Butcher v Lachlan Elder
at [109] (McHugh J, dissenting),
endorsed in
Campbell v Backoffice Investments
at [102] (Gummow, Hayne,
Heydon and Kiefel JJ). Therefore, while it is necessary to consider each
instance of alleged misleading or
deceptive conduct as pleaded, that
consideration must be undertaken in light of all of the relevant surrounding
facts and circumstances.
This is the approach that I have adopted in considering
the ACCC’s allegations against Jayco Corp. The relevant circumstances
include consideration of the person or persons to whom the conduct was directed.
Butcher v Lachlan Elder
, the majority Justices drew a division between
cases involving conduct directed generally towards a class of persons, and those
conduct towards an identified person or persons: at [36] (Gleeson CJ,
Hayne and Heydon JJ). In considering conduct towards a class
of persons, such as
in cases involving mass advertising campaigns, the court is to isolate by some
criterion or criteria a representative
member of the class for assessment:
Campomar v Nike
at [101]-[103]. In considering conduct towards an
identified person, such as in the present proceeding in respect each of the
it is not necessary that the court reconstruct the person into a
hypothetical, ordinary person:
Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd
at [26] (French CJ). Rather, the court must consider the
characteristics of the particular person:
Butcher v Lachlan Edler
[36]-[37] (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ). The relevant
circumstances may include the relationship between the person engaging
impugned conduct and the recipient, the knowledge of the recipient, the
reasonably known characteristics of the recipient,
and the effect of the conduct
on a reasonable person in the recipient’s position: see,
Miller v BMW
at [20] (French CJ and Kiefel J);
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v Valve Corporation (No 3)
[2016] FCA 196
337 ALR 647
(Edelman J).
that is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, may include
the making of representations as to the law
or legal rights. This proceeding
raises allegations of conduct of that kind. Such representations may relate to
the existence of
rights in a particular relationship or arising from a
particular transaction, in a general sense: see, for example,
Corporation v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
[2017] FCAFC
351 ALR 584
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v LG
Electronics Australia Pty Ltd
[2018] FCAFC 96.
Others may relate to the
exercise of rights in particular circumstances that may depend upon questions of
judgment involving fact
and degree. In considering such representations, it is
necessary to be mindful that a representation in the nature of an appraisal
opinion does not necessarily give rise to a contravention of
it later proves to be inaccurate. An opinion, so expressed, at least if it is
genuinely held and there is a basis for it,
however erroneous, misrepresents
Global Sportsman v Mirror Newspapers
at 88 (Bowen J, Lockhart
and Fitzgerald JJ). The High Court made this point in
Campbell v Backoffice
, in which it was held that the provision of financial estimates
in pre-contractual documents before a corporate transaction, which
were believed
to be true but which turned out to be inaccurate, was not misleading or
deceptive. In circumstances closer to the present
proceeding, Dowsett J in
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Bunavit Pty Ltd
, commented on the potential danger of penalising suppliers for
denials of liability, such as denials that a defect in goods
amounts to a major failure of a statutory warranty, which later turn
wrong. I have considered these issues further in assessing the ACCC’s
claims in this proceeding, below.
cases involving representations as to the law or legal rights may involve claims
(1)(m) of the ACL, such as the ACCC has made in the
present proceeding. The general prohibition on misleading or deceptive conduct
operates concurrently with the more specific prohibitions in
of the ACL, the scope of that prohibition is narrower than
that of the general prohibition in
It is limited by reference to:
the area of trade or commerce – relevantly in connection with the
supply of goods; the form
of the impugned conduct – being a false or
misleading representation; and the subject of that representation –
the existence, exclusion or effect of any condition, warranty,
guarantee, right or remedy (including the statutory consumer guarantees
contained in Division 1 of
of the ACL). There was no dispute as to
these limits in this proceeding. As to the content of the prohibition, there is
“no relevant distinction between the phrases ‘misleading
or deceptive’ on the one hand and ‘false or misleading’
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty
[2009] FCA 682
(Gordon J), cited with approval in
Competition and Consumer Commission v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd
[2014] FCA 634
(Allsop CJ),
Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne v Powell
[2015] FCA 1110
(Beach J), and
ACCC v TPG FCAFC
at [21] (Wigney,
O’Bryan and Jackson JJ). In this proceeding, the ACCC submitted that
a general equivalence between
applied to the
impugned representations, which was not disputed. On that basis, in keeping with
the structure of the parties’
submissions and following the approach taken
in many other cases considering these provisions, I will consider together the
allegations that Jayco Corp engaged in misleading or deceptive
conduct, and made false or misleading representations, towards the
Consumers in
contravention of
(1)(m) of the ACL.
turning to the ACCC’s allegations, it is to be noted that one relevant
distinction between the general prohibition in
and the more
specific prohibition in
is the broader range of remedies
available upon a finding of contravention of the specific prohibition. Those
available remedies
extend to pecuniary penalties under s 224(1)(a)(ii),
which the ACCC seeks against Jayco Corp in this proceeding, and also adverse
publicity orders under s 247(1)(a) and orders disqualifying a person from
managing corporations under s 248(1)(a)(ii), which the
ACCC does not seek.
I note that there is also a strict liability offence under

, which is not raised
by this proceeding.

would have to speak to Jayco Sydney about any issues with his RV as they were
responsible for the RV and any remedy provided; and
was not up to Jayco Corp to provide any remedy including a refund or
replacement.
making those oral statements, Jayco Corp represented that:
Corp had no role in the provision of a remedy to MO by Jayco Sydney; and
Corp was not responsible for providing any remedy including a refund or
replacement.
are two layers to these allegations. The first layer is the allegation in
paragraph [1] that in or about August 2014 an unnamed
representative
of Jayco Corp made oral statements “to the following effect” during
the course of a telephone conversation
Consumer MO
. The second
layer is a further gloss that is placed by paragraph [2] on the effect of
the oral statements by alleging two representations,
in much the same way that
imputations in a defamation proceeding might be pleaded.
meaning of words is usually sensitive to context. When spoken words are alleged
to have legal consequences, it is generally necessary
that there be precision in
both the pleading and proof of the words alleged to have been spoken. For
instance, in cases of defamation
by spoken words, it is necessary to plead the
words alleged to have been spoken, and to prove the publication of words that
are substantially
the same as those alleged:
Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty
Ltd v Clarke
[2013] NSWCA 272
(Simpson J, Gleeson JA
agreeing). That is because the cause of action is based upon the actual words
used where “everything
may turn on the form of words”:
[1879] UKLawRpCP 5
(1879) 4 CPD 125
at 128 (Lord Coleridge CJ). Similar issues may arise
in determining whether a parol contract was formed, and if so, its terms. There
are usually two steps in such an analysis:
proof of the content of
the oral communications, and then
an objective
determination in accordance with well-known principles of whether what was said
between the parties amounted to an offer
and acceptance, and if so, the terms of
the offer. As with proof of any fact, these matters need not be established by
direct evidence,
but may arise by inference, and direct evidence may be
supported by circumstantial evidence.
position here is not dissimilar. The conduct of Jayco Corp that is alleged to
have been in contravention of
of the ACL is the making of oral
statements that are alleged to have conveyed particular meanings. I set out
below some passages
from the reasons of McClelland CJ in Eq in
(1995) 49 NSWLR 315
at 318-319 which are apposite, and which I
respectfully adopt –
Where, in civil proceedings, a party alleges that the
conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive
(which I will compendiously described as “misleading”) within the
Trade Practices Act
(Cth) (or s 42 of
Fair Trading Act
), it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove
to the reasonable satisfaction of the court: (1) what the alleged conduct was;
and (2) circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading. Where the conduct
is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation,
it is necessary that
the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the
court to be reasonably satisfied
that they were in fact misleading in the proved
circumstances. In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words
misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been
seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use
of one word, phrase or
grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some
qualifying word or phrase,
or condition. Furthermore, human memory of what was
said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the
degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where
disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes
of memory are overlaid,
often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious
consideration of what should have
been said or could have been said. All too
often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which
details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. All this is
a matter of ordinary human experience.
Each element of the cause of action must be proved to the reasonable
satisfaction of the court, which means that the court “must
feel an actual
persuasion of its occurrence or existence”. Such satisfaction is
“not ... attained or established independently
of the nature and
consequence of the fact or facts to be proved” including the
“seriousness of an allegation made, the
inherent unlikelihood of an
occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing
from a particular finding”:
Helton v Allen
[1940] HCA 20
(1940) 63 CLR 691
Considerations of the above kinds can pose serious difficulties of proof for a
party relying upon spoken words as the foundation
of a causes of action based on
Trade Practices Act
(Cth) (or s 42 of the
Trading Act
), in the absence of some reliable contemporaneous record or
other satisfactory corroboration. That is the position in the present
There is no contemporaneous document in evidence which supports the making of
any such promise or representation as is relied
on and no other satisfactory
corroboration.

this time but I do not now recall exactly when, I called Jayco Corporation
asking to speak to someone about the problems I’d
been having with Jayco
Sydney and my camper trailer, in that I wasn’t getting anywhere with them.
They passed me on to Phil
who I understood to be pretty high up in
Jayco Corporation.
this stage the camper trailer’s roof had already collapsed twice, and it
would have been about a year old. It had been in
repairs for a few months. [Last
sentence not read].
spoke to Phil about what was happening, and he sounded so sympathetic. I
explained to Phil that I was dissatisfied with the product,
that the roof had
collapsed and that I was at my wits end. I told him about the conversation I had
with Tyrone at the 2014 Rosehill
show. He gave me the impression that he
was going to help make a change and that I was finally getting somewhere. But
then he told
me that I would have to go back and speak to Tyrone about any
issues that I had with my camper trailer as he was the selling dealer
responsible for my camper trailer and any remedy provided. Phil also said
something to the effect that it was not up to Jayco Corporation
to provide me
with any remedy including a refund or replacement. I got the impression from
Phil that it was nothing to do with Jayco
Corporation, that all they did was
supply the product and that I had to deal with Tyrone to get any remedy
whatsoever because I had
not bought it from Jayco Corporation - I had bought it
from Jayco Sydney.
seemed like neither Jayco Corporation nor Jayco Sydney could come to an amicable
solution to satisfy me as a customer.

From what I was told by Tyrone and Phil, I got
the impression that there was no
way Jayco Corporation or Jayco Sydney would give me a new camper
oral evidence-in-chief,
Consumer MO
changed his affidavit evidence,
stating that the reference to “Phil” in paragraphs [61] and [63] of
his affidavit was
a mistake of his, and that the person to whom he spoke was
Peter Manning. In cross-examination,
Consumer MO
said that he
realised the mistake in the time leading up to the hearing,
... somewhere along the lines I’ve –
I’ve got jumbled and mixed up with a single name. And – and –
going back through some of the paperwork that I do have at home, I made the
understanding that I had written some notes down on the
day of the phone call to
Jayco – Jayco Australia in Melbourne. And I came across his name, and I
realised at that stage that
I had called him “Phil” in my affidavit
and not Peter Manning.
Consumer MO
stated in cross-examination that he had made a contemporaneous note of the
conversation in a job book, which was more than likely
at his home. Later in
cross-examination,
Consumer MO
agreed that the note that he took
consisted of no more than Mr Manning’s name and telephone number,
that there was no date attributed
to the note, and that there was no note of
what was discussed.
Consumer MO
was asked about when the conversation took place –
Q: So when did that happen, Mr [MO]?
A: I – I just said to you I would have to refer to my notes. It would be
after I have sent the letter of demand saying that
I’m dissatisfied with
the repairs and that they had not finished them properly, and I wanted my money
returned to me. So it
was after the letter of demand was sent.
Q: And when was the letter of demand sent?
A: I said to you that I would have to refer to my affidavit. Because this
happened – it is now 2019. This happened in 2014,
the best part of nearly
five years ago now. And my memory is not that great that I will keep such an
– an awful experience
like dealing with Jayco down to the days and the
– and the dates of – of a phone call that – of multiple,
times I made phone calls to Jayco, whether it was Blacktown and Jayco
Australia, trying to resolve this issue.
Consumer MO
identified the letter of demand to which he was referring in his answer as the
letter to Mr Holman dated 17 August 2014 to which

elicited responses from Mr Manning and Mr Holman the following day, to
which I referred at [
Rigby was at the relevant times employed by Jayco Corp as a service manager.
There are emails in evidence passing between
him and Jayco Sydney in 2014 in
which he referred to himself as “Phil”. In cross-examination,
Consumer MO
stated that he had not ever heard the name Philip Rigby
in connection with the case.
Consumer MO
gave evidence in cross-examination in relation to the preparation of his
affidavit, which he described a process of reconstruction
Q: Do you recall how long it took to draft your
A: Very, very long period of my personal time. We spent a lot and a lot, a lot
of hours on the phone trying to reconstruct through
the photographs of –
of the photographs of all of the problems I had, was we were using the dates
from those times to work
out when the van was taken, repaired, returned,
re-taken again, repaired again. And it was all to do with – as – as
as the van left my premises, I would take a photo of it on the tilt tray
again. As it would return home, I would take photos of the
things that
weren’t finished that had just been in to be repaired. The ACCC provided
so much of the timeline because Jayco
had given them so much of the
corresponding information between me and them. This is how the case has come
around, is that as Jayco
Blacktown have had multiple complaints against them,
and then out of the blue the ACCC have turned up for an inquiry, and rung me
after many, many years of – of – I had sent them a letter of demand.
I never got anything out of it. I had never got
my – my – my
situation resolved, and I had gone off with my life. I had gone on with my life.
And then the ACCC have
dug this up and investigated
was cross-examined about the claimed conversation. He was first asked whether he
recalled having a conversation with
Consumer MO
Q: ... do you recall having a telephone conversation
with [MO] at any stage?
A: At this – at this point unless I’ve got some reference to it, no,
Q: Right. Is it possible that you had a conversation with [MO] at some stage,
during the course of which the van had been in for
repairs for a few months, but
had not yet been completed?
A: Honestly, I can’t recall.
cross-examination of Mr Manning then proceeded upon a hypothesis that it
that he had a conversation with
Consumer MO
Q: Right. [MO] says that around the time of when the van
had been in repair for a few months, he had a conversation with you. Now,
can’t recall it, but you wouldn’t reject the possibility that you
had a conversation with [MO]?
A: Yes. It would be a strong chance if it was – the van was in for a long
period. He – he would have possibly called
Q: Thank you. And he says that in the course of that conversation, he told you
that he was dissatisfied with the product, that the
roof had collapsed and that
he was at his wit end – wit’s end, or words to that effect.
It’s possible that he said
that to you?
A: Quite possible.
Q: Yes. And he said that you said to him he would have to go back to Tyrone
as Tyrone was the selling
dealer and was responsible for any remedy, or words to that effect. Is that the
might have said?
A: I don’t know about the remedy section, what that means.
Q: He mightn’t have used that phrase, I suppose?
A: But it could have – it could have been down the path of what
we’ve already talked about with: I can only authorise
repairs and your
contract of sale is with Sydney and you will have to – if – again,
if we – we were talking about
a replacement or refund, I possibly would
have worded it like that, to contact - - -
Q: Yes. If he raised with you that he wanted a refund or a replacement.
Q: - - - it’s quite possible that you would have said to him words to the
effect that: well, you will have to go back and speak
to Tyrone about
A: Yes, or his selling dealer.
Q: Or the selling dealer?
the following reasons, I do not accept the ACCC’s claim that Jayco Corp
made oral statements to
Consumer MO
to the effect of those alleged
in the particulars of its concise statement to which I have referred at [
do not accept as reliable
Consumer MO
’s evidence of the
alleged conversation. In his affidavit, after referring to the occasion on which
Jayco Sydney collected his
RV on 7 May 2014,
Consumer MO
stated that the conversation occurred at “around this time”, but
that he could not recall when. The structure of the
affidavit places the
conversation at about 7 May 2014. Paragraph [65] of the affidavit,
which refers to
Consumer MO
feeling like he had no other option
other than to allow Jayco Sydney to repair the RV tends to support this timing.
However, in cross-examination,
Consumer MO
placed the conversation
after he had sent his letter to Mr Holman dated 17 August 2014,
to which he received responses from Mr Manning
and Mr Holman the
following day. Mr Manning’s response makes no reference to a
conversation with
Consumer MO
, and neither response supports a
finding that a conversation of the type that
Consumer MO
in his affidavit occurred at that time. The drafting of
Consumer MO
’s affidavit relied upon reconstruction, which is
apparent from his answers in cross-examination. Although
Consumer MO
stated that his recollection of the fact that the conversation was with
Mr Manning rather than “Phil” was based upon
a written note, he
also stated that the note did not record either the substance or the date of a
conversation. Moreover,
Consumer MO
’s evidence about the
conversation was impressionistic: he
referred to his
“impression” on three occasions in paragraphs [63] and [65] of his
affidavit. It was in this context that
Consumer MO
stated that
“Phil”, which he corrected to Mr Manning, said “something
to the effect” that it was not up to
Jayco Corp to provide him with any
remedy, including a refund or replacement, which formed the foundation for one
of the limbs of
the representations that the ACCC alleges.
material part of Mr Manning’s evidence in cross-examination is that
he did not recall speaking to
Consumer MO
. As I have already
remarked, the balance of the cross-examination proceeded upon a hypothesis that
it was possible that he spoke
Consumer MO
this state of the evidence, I am not persuaded that
Consumer MO
spoke to Mr Manning at all, as distinct from somebody else at Jayco
Corp such as Mr Philip Rigby. Further, as I have detailed, the
evidence is
inconsistent in relation to the context of the alleged conversation. Moreover,
the evidence does not establish the content
of any spoken words to a standard
that enables an evaluation to the degree necessary to consider whether they gave
rise to the representations
alleged, and whether they amounted to conduct in
contravention of the relevant provisions of the ACL. This is a case where
“everything
may turn on the form of words”. To determine whether
there was any contravening conduct would require careful consideration
actual words employed, and their context, which the evidence adduced by the ACCC
does not permit. For these reasons, I am
not persuaded that Jayco Corp made the
representations to
Consumer MO
that were alleged by the

7 August 2014, TB responded to Mr Manning’s statement per
paragraph [2] above by email enquiring who, the selling dealer
management at Jayco Corp, had responsibility for deciding whether the RV would
be replaced. Mr Manning responded by email
“Yes you would normally have to take
this up with your selling dealer in regards to a refund or replacement van

will talk to senior management here about that though. Senior
management have discussed your case with me after I told them what

asked this person specifically for a refund, because of all of the issues and
leaks we experienced, and the stress and anxiety it
had caused. He said
something to the effect of I couldn’t get a refund because Jayco were
happy to repair the van. I understood
him to be telling me that I would not be
able to get a refund under any circumstances as long as Jayco was willing to
continue to
attempt to repair the van, even though the repairs had been
previously unsuccessful.

did not identify Mr Rigby in this evidence about the conversation. The
evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.

obligations of the selling dealer.
refer to what I said at [
] above in relation to the oral
statement that the ACCC alleged that Jayco Corp made to
Consumer MO
The evidence on which the ACCC relied in support of the statement to
Consumer TB
alleged in [4] of its particulars was vague and
imprecise as to the occasion of the alleged statement. It failed to identify
who made the statement, and it was imprecise as to the content of the
statement. Mr Rigby was on notice of this evidence, and dealt
his affidavit by referring to three conversations with
Consumer TB
but none of them contained a statement substantially to the effect alleged by
the ACCC. Mr Rigby was cross-examined by senior counsel
for the ACCC about
a range of matters, but it was not put to him that he had made a statement to
Consumer TB
substantially to the effect alleged in paragraph [4] of
the ACCC’s particulars. This failure affects the weight and cogency
evidence relied on by the ACCC:
Bulstrode v Trimble
[1970] VicRp 104
[1970] VR 840
846-847 (Newton J). In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that
Mr Rigby made a statement to
Consumer TB
substantially to the
effect alleged. That leaves for consideration the written statements on which
the ACCC relied.
shall now consider the three written statements in turn. The
statement by Mr Manning of Jayco Corp on 5 March 2014 was made by
email in response to the email that
Consumer TB
had sent to
Mr Manning on 4 March 2014, to which I referred at [
] above. The focus of that email
included a complaint about Jayco Canberra and its failure to return telephone
calls. In the context
of those complaints,
Consumer TB
that Mr Manning “investigate Jayco refunding the van”. In
response to that request, Mr Manning stated that
he could not help
Consumer TB
with a refund, and that it would need to be done through
the selling dealer. The ACCC alleges that by Mr Manning’s statement,
Jayco Corp represented that it had no role in the provision of a refund to
Consumer TB
by Jayco Sydney.
Consumer TB
stated in his affidavit that he understood Mr Manning to be saying in his
email that he could not get a refund under any circumstances
from Jayco Corp,
and that the only way that he could get his money back was by going back to
Jayco Sydney.
Consumer TB
also stated in his affidavit that he was
surprised and confused that Mr Manning could not organise a refund for him,
given that he
was from the head office of Jayco Corp and he had thought Jayco
Sydney was representing Jayco Corp.
the conduct of a person in trade or commerce is misleading or deceptive, or a
representation is false or misleading, is to
be determined objectively.
Consumer TB
’s interpretation of what Mr Manning stated in
his email, while relevant, is not determinative. In this case, I give
Consumer TB
’s interpretation of what Mr Manning stated
little weight. That is for two related reasons. The first is that it is at
with the ACCC’s pleaded case in relation to
Mr Manning’s statement in the email, which had a different focus. In
closing submissions counsel for the ACCC submitted, consistently with the
pleaded case, that the 5 March 2014 email created the impression
Jayco Corp had no role in the provision of a refund to
Consumer TB
by Jayco Sydney, and that this representation was false because Jayco Corp did
have a role in the decision-making process. The second
and related reason is
that I do not accept the ACCC’s claim that the email conveyed the
representation that was alleged. The
subject matter of Mr Manning’s
statement in the email was guidance as to how
Consumer TB
direct his claim for a refund. The statement was made in a context
(1) Jayco Sydney was the supplier of the RV, as
Consumer TB
(2) under the provisions of the ACL, only Jayco Sydney was directly liable to
Consumer TB
to refund the purchase price or to replace the RV in the
event that there was a major failure to comply with a relevant statutory
guarantee; and
(3) the terms of the Jayco warranty (see [
] above) directed customers to contact
a Jayco dealer or agent.
context, the representation alleged by the ACCC was extraneous to the statement
made in Mr Manning’s email of 5 March 2014,
concerned with directing
Consumer TB
as to how he should channel his
request for a refund. Accordingly, I do not accept that the email was misleading
or deceptive, or
likely to mislead or deceive, or that it was a false or
misleading representation, as the ACCC claimed, which involved placing an
unreasonably strained construction on the statement in the email that I do not
consider that the email objectively conveyed, or was
likely to convey.
statements in two emails of Mr Manning of
7 August 2014 were relied on by the ACCC as representations by Jayco
Consumer TB
“was not entitled to a refund”. The
second statement was contained in an email of Mr Manning that was in reply
Consumer TB
’s email of the same day,
7 August 2014 (see [
] above). In that email,
Consumer TB
summarised his grievances relating to the RV, and
attached a 32 page document. He stated that he would not accept the
decision to
send the RV to Melbourne for repairs, and stated that he stood by
his position that “this van needs to be replaced as soon
possible”. In response to that demand, Mr Manning stated in his reply
] above) that he had
checked with senior management, and that their “only offer ... is to bring
the van down to the factory
to have repairs done as explained to you by Jason
to the third statement, on 7 August 2014
Consumer TB
responded to Mr Manning’s email in the terms set out at [
] above, and enquired who had
responsibility for deciding whether the RV would be replaced, and requested the
senior manager. Mr Manning responded to
Consumer TB
by email (see [
] above) which included the statement
alleged by the ACCC in its particulars.
are difficulties with the ACCC’s case in relation to the second and third
statements. The alleged representation that
Consumer TB
not entitled to a refund” is necessarily an interpretation or an
implication, and in terms it is ambiguous. The
claimed representation that
Consumer TB
was not entitled to a refund is ambiguous because it
could have a number of variations, including –
(1) as a matter of law, consumers in the position of
Consumer TB
were not entitled to refunds;
(2) Jayco Corp had decided that it would not give
Consumer TB
(3) taking account of all the facts and circumstances, as a matter of objective
entitlement,
Consumer TB
was not entitled to a
statement in the form of the first type of representation is in the nature of an
incorrect statement of the law, which may constitute
misleading or deceptive
conduct and, to the extent that it might misrepresent rights or remedies
available under Division 1 of Part
3-2 of the ACL, may engage s 29(1)(m).
Such a statement is of a similar character to those considered by the Full Court
Valve Corporation v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
[2017] FCAFC 224
351 ALR 584
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v LG Electronics Australia Pty Ltd
[2018] FCAFC 96.
In that type
of case, the representation relates to the existence of rights, and not to their
exercise in particular circumstances
that may depend upon questions of judgment
involving fact and degree. In
Valve Corporation
, the representations
related to an online gaming distribution platform, and included representations
that that fees paid by a consumer
were not refundable, and that statutory
guarantees, such as that of acceptable quality, were not applicable. The
representations
were alleged to be false or misleading because the software that
was supplied to consumers in Australia was subject to the statutory
and remedies under the ACL. In
LG Electronics
, the Full Court held that
on two occasions LG Electronics had made false representations concerning the
existence, exclusion, or
effect of any condition, warranty, guarantee, right or
remedy, as provided for in s 29(1)(m) of the ACL.
statement in the form of the second type is a statement of what Jayco Corp was
prepared to offer.
statement of the third type is a conclusion that depends upon questions of fact
and law that might require thorough investigation,
and in respect of which there
might be reasonable differences of opinion. In particular, that may be so when
the ultimate question
involves evaluative judgments about whether a failure to
comply with a statutory guarantee is a major failure. In its submissions,
ACCC relied on the representation that
Consumer TB was
entitled to a refund” in this third sense. The ACCC submitted that because
the facts established that
TB was entitled to a refund, the
statements made by Jayco Corp created a false impression.
starting point in assessing the ACCC’s claim is to consider what was
actually said, and the context in which it was said:
LG Electronics
at [57]. Starting with the second statement, fairly understood the statement
went no further than to communicate what Jayco Corp’s
position was in
relation to
Consumer TB
’s request for a refund. Whether he was
so entitled was an issue that Jayco Corp contested, and continued to contest in
proceeding. In context, Mr Manning’s statement about what senior
management of Jayco Corp was prepared to offer did not misrepresent
or content of rights under the ACL. Nor did the words used by Mr Manning
convey a representation in the sense argued by
the ACCC, namely as a matter of
objective analysis
Consumer TB
was not entitled to a refund.
Mr Manning’s statements conveyed nothing more than Jayco Corp’s
position on the basis of
the facts presented to it.
third statement relied on by the ACCC was of the same character. It was a
statement about the opinion of senior management of
Jayco Corp on the basis of
the facts presented, namely that they did not deem the repairs to the RV to be
major, and by implication
that would be the view that they would convey to the
selling dealer when discussing whether
Consumer TB
was entitled to a
refund or a replacement.
the foregoing reasons, I do not accept the ACCC’s claims of contravention
of ss 18(1) and 29(1)(m) of the ACL in relation
to the statements
alleged to have been made by Jayco Corp to
Consumer TB
The representations which the ACCC alleges Jayco Corp made
to Consumer JT
relation to
Consumer JT
, the ACCC alleged that –
representatives of Jayco Corp who he identifies as a manager
and one of his
bosses. During that conversation, JT made his third request to Jayco Corp for a
refund or replacement. The Jayco Corp
representative(s) responded in words to
the effect that:
would not be given a refund or replacement;
RV would be repaired because it was under warranty and JT had to give Jayco Corp
a chance to fix it.
making the statements particularised in paragraph [1] above, Jayco Corp
represented that JT was not entitled to a refund or replacement
from anyone and
was required to allow further repairs to be carried out.
] above, I have accepted
Consumer JT
’s evidence as to the fact of the telephone
conference call with two employees of Jayco Corp, and as to what was stated by
in the call. For reasons to which I will come, I find that the call likely
occurred on or after 1 February 2016.
Consumer JT
affidavit evidence about the call was as follows –
this time, although I now [no] longer recall precisely when, I had a conference
call with a Manager at Jayco Corporation and
one of his bosses.
this conversation, I was again told that I would not be given a refund or
replacement.
this conference call, one or both of the Jayco people spoke. I now cannot recall
who said what but I can recall generally what
was said. Part of the conversation
was in words to the following effect:
Jayco person said: You are getting it
repaired, it is under warranty, you have to give us a chance to fix it.
I said: I have given you the chance to fix it and I don’t want it to be
repaired again, I want my money back or a new van.
They said: Well, tell us what you want.
I said: I want what I paid for, or my money back.
They said: Well, you got what you paid for.
I said: No, I got a van that is leaking.
They said: We will fix it.
impression that I got was that I had no rights to get a refund and that they
would only offer to repair it. I understood that
I would not get a refund or
replacement in any circumstances, from anyone. I got the impression from how
Jayco Corporation dealt
with me that Jayco Corporation were bullies. They knew
that I could not take them to court or do anything to get the resolution I
wanted, and they were trying to get me off the phone and just give me constant
repairs with no actual solution. The way they treated
me, I thought that they
were not concerned with my actual issues and were trying to get me to just go
has been indicated, the ACCC alleges that Jayco Corp represented that
Consumer JT
was not entitled to a refund or replacement
and was required to allow further repairs to be carried out. The
words “from anyone” in the pleaded representation are
significant,
because I did not understand the ACCC to submit that Jayco Corp was directly
Consumer JT
to replace his RV, or to furnish a refund.
Having said that, I find on the unchallenged evidence that the substance of the
concerned with whether
Consumer JT
was entitled to a refund or
replacement RV at all, and was not concerned with the niceties of the different
liabilities of Jayco Corp
and Jayco Sydney.
have referred at [
ambiguity that may exist in statements made in the course of conversations about
requests for refunds or replacement goods.
I am not persuaded that, by the words
used, the Jayco employees were conveying anything more than their opinion that
there was no
major failure, and Jayco Corp’s position that the RV could be
repaired, and that for those reasons
Consumer JT
was not entitled to
a refund. A representation of that type is consistent with other communications
at about that time, including
the first paragraph of Mr Holman’s
Consumer JT
on 1 February 2016 to which I referred
], and the statements
attributed to Mr Holman at the meeting in early February 2016 to which
I referred at [
] above. The conduct in making those
statements was not misleading or deceptive simply because, upon a full and
careful appraisal
of all the evidence, the court has come to a different view on
the contestable issue whether there was a major failure to comply
statutory guarantee of acceptable quality.
The representations which the ACCC alleges Jayco Corp made
to Consumer RH
relation to
Consumer RH
, the ACCC alleged in its concise statement
5 May 2015, Mr Peter Manning, a Jayco Corp Service Manager,
responded to RH’s first request for a refund or replacement from
Corp by stating:
“I am in warranty. So from Jayco I can
approve warranty repairs. I cannot help you with another van or money back. You
have to go back to the place you have your contract of sale with. That
being Jayco Newcastle. I cannot guarantee this will be the
outcome for you as
the terms and conditions of warranty are to repair
making the statement particularised in paragraph 1 above, Jayco Corp represented
Corp would not approve the replacement of RH’s RV under the Jayco
Corp had no role in relation to the provision of a refund to RH by Jayco
Newcastle; and
was not entitled to a refund or replacement from anyone and the only remedy
available to her was a repair.
have referred to Mr Manning’s email to
Consumer RH
5 May 2015 at [
above. It was not in dispute that the email was sent, or that it contained the
statements alleged by the ACCC.
do not accept that the statements made by Mr Manning were misleading or
deceptive, or constituted false representations, in the
sense claimed by the
representations alleged in paragraphs [2(a)] and [2(b)] set out above. The
representation alleged in paragraph
[2(b)] is contrived and not tenable, and the
representation alleged in [2(a)] is strained. Even if the representation alleged
paragraph [2(a)] was conveyed, I do not consider that it was misleading or
deceptive as to Jayco Corp’s position in relation
Consumer RH’s
real gravamen of the statement, however, is the representation alleged in
paragraph [2(c)], the substance of which I find was
conveyed by the statements
in Mr Manning’s email. Because the representation was made by
reference to the “terms and
conditions of warranty’,
Mr Manning’s statement was not a statement of Jayco Corp’s
position in relation to
Consumer RH
’s claim, but was a
representation as to legal entitlements generally. The statement did not make
clear whether it was directed
solely to the contractual terms contained within
the Jayco warranty itself that granted Jayco Corp sole discretion to repair or
the RV or defective parts of the RV, or whether it also extended to the
“terms and conditions of warranty” in a broader
sense including
consumers’ rights under the ACL, which were expressly stated not to be
excluded under the Jayco warranty. My
view is that, read objectively and in
context, Mr Manning’s statement extended to that broader meaning. The
statement distinguished
between the position of Jayco Corp under the Jayco
warranty, and the position of the selling dealer, Jayco Newcastle, who
Consumer RH
had her “contract of sale with”, which gave
rise to Jayco Newcastle’s obligations as a supplier under the ACL.
Manning directed
Consumer RH
to take up her request for a
replacement RV or a refund with Jayco Newcastle. Then, by the final sentence of
the statement, Mr Manning
represented that he could not guarantee the
outcome of any approach by
RH to Jayco Newcastle, and in
doing so, his statement necessarily carried a representation as to
Consumer RH
’s legal entitlements in the broader sense
including her rights as a consumer under the ACL.
representation was misleading or deceptive, and was false or misleading, because
it conveyed that the only remedy to which
Consumer RH
could ever be
entitled was repair, because that was the claimed effect of the Jayco warranty.
This was not the case because the Jayco
warranty did not affect the rights of a
consumer under the ACL.
Corp submitted that the statement made by Mr Manning was true, in that
(1) the issues raised by
Consumer RH
give rise to any contractual relief other than repairs;
(2) Mr Manning did not have authority to approve consumers’ requests
for refunds or replacements;
(3) the first step in Jayco Corp’s warranty process, in so far as the
consumer wished to obtain a replacement RV, was that
the consumer was asked to
have his or her RV assessed by the selling dealer; and
(4) insofar as the consumer wished to obtain a replacement RV or a refund, the
selling dealer had the primary obligations under the
ACL to provide it in
appropriate circumstances.
submissions were directed to the statement, and did not engage with the
representation alleged in paragraph [2(c)] which is
the material sense in which
I find that the statement was misleading or deceptive, and false or misleading.
Jayco Corp also submitted
Consumer RH
was well aware of her
rights under the ACL. It is unnecessary that I make any finding about that
question at this point, because
it is irrelevant to the objective question
whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive,
the representation was false or misleading. If it were necessary to
make a finding on that issue, I would not accept the submission
of Jayco Corp.
Senior counsel for Jayco Corp did not explore in cross-examination of
Consumer RH
the extent to which she was aware of her rights under
the ACL, and while the evidence might support an inference that
Consumer RH
had a general awareness that consumers have rights, it
does not establish that
Consumer RH
was “well aware of her
rights under the ACL” such as to eliminate the reasonable prospect that
Mr Manning’s statement
was liable to mislead.
therefore find that by Mr Manning’s first email to
Consumer RH
dated 5 May 2015, Jayco Corp engaged in
conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in
contravention
of s 18(1) of the ACL, and that in addition, Jayco Corp made
a false or misleading representation in contravention of s 29(1)(m)
ACL concerning the existence of a right or remedy.

, there are differences of expression and emphasis in the reasons
of the majority Justices, Kiefel CJ and Bell J, Gageler J, and
J, in describing some aspects of the organising principles
However, as a question of authority, I do not understand the reasons of the
majority Justices in
Paciocco HCA
as combining to
detract from the analysis and the principles that were essayed by Allsop CJ
Paciocco FCAFC
. It is not possible in any summary of principles to do
justice to the depth of that analysis. Subject to that observation, for the
purposes of the present proceeding, I take the applicable principles to be as
a question arises as to whether impugned conduct is unconscionable for the
purposes of
, what is required is an evaluative conclusion as to
whether the conduct is to be characterised as unconscionable. In undertaking
that evaluative task, the text of
directs attention to
circumstances
, which informs the judicial technique that is required in
assessing the impugned conduct against the statutory norm: see,
[86]-[87] (Gageler J) and at [120] (Keane J),
Paciocco FCAFC
[271] and [281], and
at [233]-[236]. An allegation that a party
has engaged in unconscionable conduct requires that there be “a scrutiny
of the exact
relations established between the parties”:
Public Curator (Qld)
[1953] HCA 2
(1953) 90 CLR 113
(Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ), cited in
(Keane J). As such, an evaluation of whether conduct is unconscionable
involves taking a more comprehensive view of the
facts than a court of law might
in determining whether the elements of a common law cause of action are made
out, because the evaluation
by the court of an allegation of unconscionable
conduct invites attention to “every connected circumstance that ought to
its determination upon the real justice of the case”:
[1822] EngR 235
(1822) 2 Dods 504
at 522 (Lord Stowell);
Paciocco FCAFC
[271]-[275] (Allsop CJ);
(Gagler J). The judicial technique that is described in these authorities
has some similarities to the consideration of circumstantial
evidence, which may
involve evaluating the overall effect of the detail, which may be “best
appreciated by standing back and
viewing it from a distance, making an informed,
considered and qualitative appreciation of the whole. The overall effect of the
is not necessarily the same as the sum total of the individual

at 141 (Tadgell JA), citing
Hall (Inspector of Taxes) v Lorimer
[1992] 1 WLR 939
at 944 (Mummery J).
the enquiry involves an evaluative judgment, it is an enquiry to which there is
one correct answer:
at [47] (Kiefel CJ and Bell J). As such,
the evaluation does not involve some mix of judicial discretion, personal
intuitive assertion,
or the formless void of individual moral opinion, but as
Allsop CJ stated in
Paciocco FCAFC
at [296], it is “an
evaluation which must be reasoned and enunciated by reference to the values and
norms recognised by the
text, structure and context of the legislation, and made
against an assessment of all connected circumstances.” See also:
at [56] and [58] (Allsop CJ), and cf,
Muschinski v Dodds
160 CLR 583
at 616 (Deane J).
statutory norm established by
of the ACL is fixed by the text of the
section, when construed against its context and purpose. The language of the
norm is broadly
expressed, and is to be understood and applied in the particular
circumstances that arise:
at [41]. The matters set out in
are matters to which the court must have regard, if relevant:
at [72] (Besanko J);
at [252], both citing
Paciocco HCA
at [189] (Gageler J). The matters provide guidance for
the purpose of determining whether a person has engaged in unconscionable
in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services.
The themes running through the matters specified in the paragraphs
were identified by Allsop CJ in
Paciocco FCAFC
to be: fairness and equality – see paras (a), (b), (d) to
(k); a lack of understanding or ignorance of a party – para
(c); the risk
and worth of the bargain – paras (e) and (i); and good faith and fair
dealing – para (l). While disparity
in bargaining power between the
parties, which is referred to in
, may be one factor which may
contribute to the evaluation, its mere existence does not establish that the
party with superior bargaining
power acts unconscionably by exercising it:
Paciocco HCA
at [293] (Keane J).
the structure and language of
of the ACL bear close
similarities to
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Act
, which were considered in
Paciocco FCAFC
Paciocco HCA
, one must bear in mind that
sits within the ACL, and is specifically concerned with conduct in connection
with the supply of goods and services which, in respect
of transactions with
consumers, is also regulated by other provisions of the ACL to which I have
referred. While statements of principle
relating to cognate provisions in other
legislation provide highly valuable and persuasive insight and guidance in
relation to the
operation of
of the ACL, one must be mindful that what
is in issue is
of the ACL, and its text, context, and purpose, and the
harmonious goals to which the ACL is directed: see,
Brennan v Comcare
[1994] FA 360;
[1994] FCA 1147
at 572 (Gummow J),
McNamara v Consumer
Trader and Tenancy Tribunal
[2005] HCA 55
221 CLR 646
Gummow and Heydon JJ).
legislative choice of the word
unconscionable
of the ACL to
identify the conduct that is proscribed is significant to determining the scope
of the proscription:
at [118]-[119] (Keane J). So too is the
provision in
of the ACL for the imposition of a penalty for
contravention of
Paciocco FCAFC
at [53], Allsop CJ referred to the seriousness of a
finding of unconscionable conduct, which in that case was sought against a bank.
unconscionable
means something not done in good
conscience:
at [41]. Similarly, the
Shorter Oxford English
edition, 2007) defines unconscionable in its
first meaning as “[s]howing no regard for conscience; not in accordance
is right or reasonable”. For the purposes of
ACL, the conscience by reference to which the standard is to be evaluated is not
the conscience of a person, or of an individual
judge. Rather, it is a metaphor
that embodies a construct of the values and norms of society that are to be
derived from the text
and structure of the legislation that go to inform
standards of conscientious behaviour: see,
at [239]. One issue
that has attracted the attention of appellate courts is whether statutory
unconscionable conduct must involve
some level of moral obloquy. In
Keane J at [119] stated that “the legislative choice
of ‘unconscionability’ as the key statutory concept, rather
less morally freighted terms such as ‘unjust’, ‘unfair’
or ‘unreasonable’, confirms that
the moral obloquy involved in the
exploitation or victimisation that is characteristic of unconscionable conduct
is also required
for a finding of [statutory unconscionability]”. The
other Justices forming the majority did not express themselves in these
Kiefel CJ and Bell J in their joint judgment at [60] referred with
apparent approval to the approach of the Full Court, under
which moral obloquy
had a role to play, but was not a substitute for the statutory words. Under this
approach it was relevant that
the respondent, Mr Kobelt, had been held to
have acted with a degree of good faith, and not dishonesty, to which the Full
correctly had regard. Gageler J at [91]-[92] retreated from his
Honour’s use of the language of “high level of moral
Paciocco HCA
at [188], but explained that what he meant to convey by
the use of that description was that what was required was “conduct
is so far outside societal norms of acceptable commercial behaviour as to
warrant condemnation as conduct that is offensive
to conscience.” And at
[88] and [90], Gageler J referred to the gravity of conduct that is
associated with the term
unconscionable
, citing the reasons of
Bryson J in
Burt v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd
(1994) ATPR (Digest) 46
‑123 at 53,598, who stated,
“[u]nconscionability is not a slight matter, and behaviour is only
unconscionable where there
is some real and substantial ground based on
conscience for preventing a person from relying on what are, in terms of the
law, that person’s legal rights”.
my purposes, the question whether unconscionable conduct must involve moral
obloquy has been resolved by the Full Courts in
Paciocco FCAFC, Kojic
Colin R Price
The text of
should not be substituted by judicial formulations that are directed to
developing the organising principles and the conceptual
boundaries of
unconscionable conduct. References to conduct involving a high degree of
moral obloquy
as a description of
unconscionable
conduct are a
gloss on the statutory text:
at [240]. However, as Keane J
at [118] and Allsop CJ in
suggest, the reference to
moral obloquy
may serve to differentiate
conduct that is truly unconscionable from conduct that is of a lesser order such
as being unjust, or unfair.
Gageler J expressed much the same idea in
[92], although as I have noted, preferring to eschew the
moral obloquy.
Ipstar Australia Pty Ltd v APS Satellite
[2018] NSWCA 15
329 FLR 149
), Leeming JA
at [277]-[278] made a similar point in terms endorsed by Beach J in
at [242]. In this sense, moral obloquy may have a role to play,
but as the authorities emphasise, the statutory text refers to conduct
unconscionable
Paciocco FCAFC
at [262], Allsop CJ
explained –
The task involved is not the choice of synonyms; rather,
it is to identify and apply the values and norms that Parliament must be
to have considered relevant to the assessment of unconscionability: being the
values and norms from the text and structure
of the Act, and from the context of
the provision.
Beach J at [240] adopted the analysis of
Allsop CJ in
Paciocco FCAFC
and at [241] stated that “[a]t
most, the statutory concept of unconscionable may accommodate a
of moral obloquy, but it is to divert the relevant normative enquiry to
specifically seek to identify its existence or to clothe the
relevant conduct
with such a conclusory label”.
related issue is the extent to which an alleged contravener’s state of
mind is relevant to whether conduct is to be characterised
as unconscionable. In
this case, senior counsel for the ACCC clarified in final address that the ACCC
did not submit that Jayco Corp
consciously
shut the Consumers out from
their alleged rights under the ACL. Rather, the ACCC’s case was that the
shutting out, or obstruction,
of the Consumers’ rights under the ACL was
of what Jayco Corp did, and that the community would require
of a corporation of its nature that it be aware of, informed by, and
of the Consumers’ rights embedded in the ACL.
an alleged contravener’s subjective state of mind may be relevant, the
enquiry to determine whether a person engaged in
statutory unconscionable
conduct is necessarily broader. A broader, objective focus is dictated by the
statute itself, which requires
an assessment of whether the alleged
contravener’s
was, in all the circumstances,
unconscionable. As stated by Keane J in
at [120], in considering
the corresponding statutory norm in
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Act
, the “ultimate issue under the statute is
whether the
in question is rightly to be characterised as
unconscionable”. The other majority Justices in
commented on
the relevance of an alleged contravener’s subjective state of mind to that
ultimate objective assessment. Kiefel
CJ and Bell J stated at [59] that it may
be accepted that conduct may be unconscionable in circumstances that do not
involve dishonesty,
although that was not to say that an absence of dishonesty,
or other moral taint, was not a material consideration in determining
ultimate objective assessment. Further and as I have stated above, their Honours
at [60] referred with approval to the approach
of the Full Court below, which
had considered that it was relevant that the respondent, Mr Kobelt, had
been held to have acted with
a degree of good faith, and not dishonesty.
Separately, Gageler J at [91], in retreating from his Honour’s earlier use
language of “high level of moral obloquy” in
Paciocco HCA
at [188], stated that this terminology had “the potential to be
misleading to the extent that it might be taken to suggest a
requirement for
conscious wrongdoing”, which was not contained in the statutory
proscription.
the earlier decision in
, the Full Court considered the question
of the relevance of an alleged contravener’s subjective state of mind. In
Beach J at [247], with whom Perram J and Murphy J agreed,
... statutory unconscionability does not require only
focusing on Medibank’s or its officers’ or employees’ state
mind, whether actual intention or knowledge or what it ought to have known. It
is a broader concept requiring an ‘objective
value judgment on
behaviour’ (cf
Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd
[2008] 4 All ER 713
per Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe). But the
subjective state of mind of the alleged contravener whether actual or
constructive is
relevant to the broader sense. Although I am concerned with a
normative notion of conscience, Medibank’s state of mind is
the speech of Lord Walker in
referred to by Beach J in that
his Lordship considered the role of unconscionability as a
unifying element in establishing a proprietary estoppel under English
stated at [92] that the term unconscionable was “being used (as in my
opinion it should always be used) as an objective
value judgment on behaviour
regardless of the state of mind
of the individual in
question).”
as the Full Court held in
, for the purposes of statutory
unconscionable conduct, an objective evaluation may include consideration of the
state of mind of
the alleged contravener, where it is relevant to determining
whether the impugned conduct is to be characterised as unconscionable.
of the ACL directs attention to the extent to which the supplier and
the customer acted in good faith. The leading feature of
rendered the contraveners’ conduct unconscionable was the deceptive ruse
that was employed to obtain entry to the consumers’
of attempting to sell vacuum cleaners, and that intentional deception was part
of the circumstances that fell
to be evaluated. And as I have mentioned above,
, Kiefel CJ and Bell J held that the Full Court had
been correct to take account of the findings that Mr Kobelt had acted with
of good faith, and not dishonesty, as among the circumstances to which
it was necessary to have regard. Moreover, morally neutral
features of an
alleged contravener’s state of mind, such as knowledge, may be relevant to
determining whether conduct with
that knowledge is objectively to be
characterised as unconscionable.
the alleged contravener is a corporation, questions of attribution of conduct,
and attribution of knowledge or some other state
of mind, will usually arise.
Section 139B
Competition and Consumer Act
provides for statutory
rules of attribution, which supplement but do not replace general principles of
attribution:
at [64] (Allsop CJ) and [109] (Edelman J).
Under general principles, in the absence of statutory support it is generally
not permissible
for the purposes of attribution of a state of mind to aggregate
the knowledge or other states of mind of different agents of a corporation:
at [89]-[149] (Edelman J, Allsop CJ at [31] and [62] generally
agreeing). However, there may be exceptions to such a generalised statement,
which turn on the particular statutory context in which the question for
determination arises:
at [66] (Allsop CJ), and see also
[81]-[83] (Besanko J). In relation to the conduct that is proscribed by
s 21 of the ACL, in
Edelman J at [112] addressed the
question of aggregation of knowledge for the purposes of the cognate provisions
of s 51AB and s 51AC
Trade Practices Act
, as formerly in
... It is not easy to see how a corporation, which can
only act through natural persons, can engage in unconscionable conduct when
of those persons acts unconscionably. Similar reasoning has led courts to reject
submissions that a corporation has acted fraudulently
where no individual has
done so (in instances of deceit) and that a corporation has acted contumeliously
where no individual has
done so (in cases of exemplary
state of knowledge or other state of mind to be attributed to a corporation will
usually be material to the question whether conduct
that is impugned is to be
characterised as unconscionable, and
were instances where the state of mind to be attributed to a corporation was
decisive to the result. But the focus of
remains whether the
of the person (the corporation) was in all the circumstances
unconscionable.
to the present proceeding, in light of the principles referred to at [
] above, the premise of the
ACCC’s unconscionable conduct case against Jayco Corp may be accepted at a
general level. That is,
Jayco Corp could have,
objectively
, engaged in
conduct that was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable because of its effect
of obstructing the Consumers’
rights under the ACL, despite Jayco Corp not
having consciously, or
subjectively
, intended to do so. Nonetheless, the
subjective state of mind to be attributed to Jayco Corp, including its motive
for engaging in
conduct alleged to have unconscionably obstructed those rights,
and whether it acted in good faith, remain relevant to that ultimate
assessment.
of the ACL makes explicit that the statutory conception of
unconscionable conduct is not confined to that developed by the unwritten
at [83], [89] (Gageler J);
Paciocco FCAFC
However, the values and norms developed by the unwritten law, both common law
and equity, have a significant part to play
in informing the statutory notion of
conscience:
Paciocco FCAFC
at [270]-[284]. The statutory notion of
conscience is also informed by the values that are embedded in other statutory
that regulate the relevant trading or commercial activity:
at [5], [23], [71];
Paciocco FCAFC
at [302]. And the statutory notion
of conscience is permeated with acceptable and accepted community values that
are explicitly or
implicitly recognised by the statute.
the context of the supply in trade or commerce of goods and services to
consumers, dealing in good conscience involves dealing
with fairness and in good
faith, and not engaging in trickery or sharp practice:
(Kiefel CJ and Bell J), citing
Paciocco FCAFC
at [296]. In
order that conduct be characterised as unconscionable it is not necessary that
there be circumstances that involve dishonesty,
but that is not to say that the
absence of dishonesty or moral taint would not be material:
[59] (Kiefel CJ and Bell J). To act in good conscience in the course of trade or
commerce in connection with the supply of goods,
a person is not required to act
in a disinterested or altruistic way, or required to act in the interests of
[75] (Kiefel CJ and Bell J), and at [117]
(Keane J). That would be a standard of conduct that equity would require of
a fiduciary.
And in determining what amounts to unconscionable conduct it is
necessary to respect the legal policy that supports certainty in
commerce, and a
bargain freely and fairly made:
at [50] (Kiefel CJ and
Paciocco FCAFC
at [297] (Allsop CJ).
, Allsop CJ at [58] stated that as the standard of unconscionability
is applied, courts will develop principles and legally relevant
considerations
that will give comfortable form to fact situations. The Chief Justice drew a
parallel to the development in the case
law applying the
Contracts Review Act
(NSW), which had given structure and content to the legal standards of
indeterminate reference contained in that legislation. One
should be mindful of
course that observations made by judges in the course of deciding issues of fact
ought not to be treated as
laying down rules of law:
Teubner v Humble
[1963] HCA 11
108 CLR 491
at 503 (Windeyer J). However, one of the
characteristics of our legal system is that legal principles, including the
organising principles
for the application of statutory provisions, are developed
through decided cases, and that “it is the insight of the common
wisdom can be drawn from previous examination of similar problems”:
Scott v Copenhagen Reinsurance Co (UK) Ltd
[2003] EWCA Civ 688
[2003] 2 All ER (Comm) 190
(Rix LJ). The common law in particular develops principles
incrementally:
Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee
(McHugh J);
Perre v Apand Pty Ltd
[1999] HCA 36
198 CLR 180
(McHugh J). There have, at
times, been difficulties in expressing unifying principles of common law that
allow the ready solution
of novel problems:
Sullivan v Moody
207 CLR 562
(the Court). Equity, however, functions differently,
because equity “involves the application of doctrines themselves
sufficiently
comprehensive to meet novel cases”:
Roads and Traffic
Authority of NSW v Dederer
[2007] HCA 42
234 CLR 330
(Gummow J). The identification of the organising principles for the
application of a statutory provision of indeterminate reference
does not involve
the common law technique of development by increments. Rather, like an equitable
doctrine, the standard is established,
albeit by the statute, which is then
given form by the articulation of principles as the statutory standard is
applied to fact situations
using the judicial technique described in
at 118-119.
these considerations in mind, it is possible to identify some findings on
statutory unconscionability made in some leading cases
decided at the appellate
level as being illustrative of the type of conduct that has, or has not, been
held to be unconscionable.
, the Full Court held that a retailer acted unconscionably in the sale
of vacuum cleaners by direct salesmen to three elderly women
in their own homes.
The Full Court held that the retailer engaged in a deceptive ruse whereby the
salesmen arranged to attend the
women’s homes under the guise of
conducting a free maintenance check of their existing vacuum cleaner, when in
reality the
purpose of their visit was to convince the women of an apparent need
to replace their vacuum cleaner, and to sell them a new vacuum

beyond the bank’s contribution to its purchase

the venture. Allsop CJ at

vulnerability,
of known mistake, of weakness, of a lack of good faith, of
disability, or of any of the considerations in the relevant provision
Trade Practices Act
, the New South Wales Court of Appeal held that a wholesale
supplier of broadband equipment and satellite bandwidth services acted
unconscionably in its dealings with its customer, an internet service provider.
The wholesale supplier had imposed a price increase
on that customer, and not
its other customers, by reference to its own exposure to statutory warranty
claims, while concurrently
refusing to pay any of those claims despite
considering some of them to be valid.

unconscionable conduct in contravention of the
Trade Practices Act
Full Court upheld the primary judge’s finding that it was unconscionable
for the trustee of a property development unit
trust to procure and rely upon a
payment authority from one unit holding entity. Parties that were involved in
the property development
venture had induced a man whom they knew to be
suffering from extreme financial and emotion stress to execute, on behalf of a
holding entity which he controlled, an agreement that had the effect of
unfairly depriving that entity of its interest in the proceeds
of the project to
cover cost overruns which affected all unit holders (see, [63]-[71]).

Hut restaurants in Australia, did not engage in unconscionable
conduct towards
its franchisees in contravention of
of the ACL. The Full Court held
that the respondent’s decision to exercise its contractual power to set

unconscionably,

operated a “book-up” system of credit to customers in the
Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands, did not act unconscionably. The book-up
system involved the respondent’s customers,
who were overwhelmingly
indigenous Australians lacking in financial literacy and living in remote
communities, authorising the respondent
to withdraw funds from their bank
accounts to reduce their debt, in return for the supply of goods between pay
days. The majority
Justices found that the book-up system was not objectively
contrary to the interests of the customers (at [77], Kiefel CJ and Bell

for his financial advantage

The ACCC’s pleaded claims of unconscionable
[4] to [9] of its concise statement, the ACCC made the following
allegations –
dealers have separate legal obligations under the Australian Consumer Law
) to comply with consumer guarantees relating to the supply of goods.
However, an ordinary consumer seeking a remedy for a defective
RV is unlikely to
understand the distinction between the consumer guarantees under the ACL and the
Jayco Warranty. At least in the
case of the Consumers, the practice of Jayco
Corp and the relevant Jayco dealers was to deal with consumer complaints as part
the Jayco Warranty process and therefore a matter for Jacyo Corp’s
discretion. Jayco dealers also sought the approval of Jayco
Corp for the making
of refunds, which was a remedy available to the Consumers under the ACL.
a consequence, Jayco Corp had express control over the replacement or repair of
an RV under the Jayco Warranty and effective control
over whether the relevant
Jayco dealer complied with its statutory obligation to provide a replacement or
dealers made lengthy, repeated and unsuccessful attempts to repair the defects
in the Consumers’ RVs. Each of the Consumers
made multiple requests for a
replacement or refund directly to Jayco Corp, as well as to the Jayco dealers
who supplied the RVs.
Every request for a refund or replacement was denied and
the Consumers were only offered further attempts at repairs.
Consumers were frustrated and distressed by the situation. Each had made a
significant purchase intended to be used for holidays
and enjoyment with their
families. This was impossible because the RVs that Jayco Corp had manufactured
were defective. In some cases,
their holidays were ruined and they suffered
significant discomfort.
Corp knew of both the manufacturing defects and the lengthy and unsuccessful
repair attempts. It knew, or ought to have known,
of the Consumers’
distress. Nevertheless, Jayco Corp refused to exercise its discretion under the
Jayco Warranty to provide
a replacement RV, pressed the position that the only
remedy available to the Consumers was another attempt at a repair (regardless
the number of unsuccessful previous attempts) and unfairly obstructed the
Consumers from obtaining a refund or replacement RV
from the Jayco dealer (to
which they were entitled under the ACL).
conduct by Jayco Corp was unconscionable. In addition, in the course of this
conduct, Jayco Corp made false and misleading representations
to the Consumers
as to their entitlement to a remedy and its own role in relation to the
Consumers’ rights or ability to obtain
a replacement or

alleged in [8] was unconscionable in contravention
of the ACL in
all of the circumstances including –
30.1 Jayco Corp produces and publishes brochures that
convey that the RVs it manufactures are of good quality;
30.2 the defects in the RVs became apparent immediately, or almost immediately,
upon receipt by each of the Consumers and could not
reasonably have been
attributable to anything other than defective manufacture by Jayco Corp;
30.3 Jayco Corp knew that each of the Consumers had suffered for a lengthy
period of time due to the defects;

functioned, properly;

assistance;
30.8 each of the Consumers was in a very weak bargaining position compared to
Jayco Corp;

only entitled to further attempts at repairs, refusing
to exercise its

the specific matters identified in
of the ACL to which the court
must have regard if relevant, there is reference in paragraph [30.8] of the
ACCC’s concise statement
to the relative bargaining position of Jayco Corp
and the consumers
(s 22(1)(a))
, and in paragraph [30.9] it is alleged that
Jayco Corp did not act in good faith
(s 22(1)(l)).
The submissions of the ACCC
ACCC submitted that Jayco Corp’s conduct towards each Consumer, considered
in the context of all the relevant circumstances,
and as a whole, was
sufficiently divergent from community standards of acceptable commercial
business practices that it objectively
answered the description of
unconscionable conduct within the meaning, and for the purpose of
the ACL. The subordinate elements of that submission may be summarised as
the RVs of each of the four Consumers contained manufacturing defects for which
Jayco Corp, as manufacturer, was responsible.
under the ACL, each of the four Consumers was entitled to reject his or her RV,
and was entitled as against the dealer who supplied
the RV to elect to receive
either a refund of the purchase price, or a replacement RV.
each Consumer’s request for a refund or replacement RV was dealt with as a
practical reality by Jayco Corp insisting upon its
right to repair the RV under
the Jayco warranty and thereby refusing to provide a refund or replacement,
including in the exercise
of its discretion under the Jayco warranty to provide
a replacement RV. The ACCC submitted that this had the consequence that Jayco
Corp effectively controlled the process of addressing the Consumers’
concerns, and obstructed the Consumers from obtaining
a refund or replacement
from the relevant dealer. The ACCC submitted that this conduct should be
characterised as unconscionable.
the ACCC relied on the false or misleading representations that it alleged were
made by Jayco Corp to the Consumers about their
entitlements to a remedy, and
Jayco Corp’s role in the process. I pause to note that I have rejected all
but one of those claims.
The one claim that I have upheld relates to the
statements in Mr Manning’s first email of 5 May 2015 to
Consumer RH
in relation to all the circumstances to which the Court should have regard, the
ACCC relied on the following –
(1) Jayco Corp represented to the Consumers that its RVs
were of good quality;
(2) the Consumers were entitled to the remedy of a refund or replacement from
their selling dealer in accordance with the consumer
guarantee provisions of the
(3) the Consumers had approached Jayco Corp and sought its assistance to obtain
refunds or replacements for their defective RVs,
for which they had paid large
amounts of money, and which had caused them significant distress and frustration
(as Jayco Corp knew
at the time); and
(4) Jayco Corp insisted on repairing the RVs (and correlatively refused to
exercise its discretion under the Jayco warranty to provide
replacement RVs),
and thereby effectively controlled how the dealers addressed the defects (by
directing and instructing them to
repair the RVs), and necessarily obstructed
each Consumer from obtaining the refund or replacement from the dealer to which
were entitled.
I have mentioned, in final addresses, including by way of reply, senior counsel
for the ACCC clarified that the ACCC did not submit
that there was conscious
wrongdoing, or conscious bad faith on the part of Jayco Corp, or a consciousness
by Jayco Corp that it was
shutting the Consumers out from the exercise of their
rights to reject their RVs under s 263(4) of the ACL, but that this was the
effect of what Jayco Corp did.
ACCC made submissions in relation to the circumstances of each Consumer, and
Jayco Corp’s refusal of requests for refunds
or replacement RVs. The ACCC
submitted that these circumstances arose in the context of the terms of the
Jayco warranty, which included
a provision allowing for Jayco Corp at its sole
discretion to “either replace or repair the RV or the defective parts of
RV, or cause the RV or defective part of the RV to be replaced or repaired
by a Jayco dealer or authorised repairer” (see [
] above). The ACCC submitted that the
circumstances also arose in the context of the statutory right of a consumer
under the ACL to
reject goods, and the obligation of Jayco Corp to indemnify a
dealer for a refund or replacement provided by the dealer to a customer
circumstances.
Consumer RH
, the ACCC relied on the problem with the roof
mechanism, which it submitted multiple repair attempts had not resolved. It
that a reasonable consumer would not have purchased the RV in those
circumstances, and that the RV was substantially unfit for purpose.
submitted that by refusing to exercise its discretion to provide a replacement
under the Jayco warranty, by telling
Consumer RH
that the warranty
was for repairs only, and that “Jayco Corp makes the decisions, not Jayco
Newcastle”, when Jayco Corp
Consumer RH
requests and insisted on repairing the RV, it necessarily and unfairly
obstructed RH from exercising her rights under the
ACL to obtain a refund, or a
replacement RV from the dealer.
must pause here to find that the ACCC’s submission that Jayco Corp told
Consumer RH
“Jayco Corp makes the decisions, not
Jayco Newcastle” is not supported by the evidence, and that by its written
submissions,
the ACCC stripped these words from their correct context. The
substance of the words was contained in the email exchange between
Mr Manning and Central Coast Caravans on 11 May 2015, to which I
referred at [
Mr Manning referred to this email exchange in his affidavit. The context,
as that email exchange indicates, was that it appeared
to Mr Manning that
Consumer RH
had claimed that he had authorised a new roof for her RV
as a warranty claim, when he had not done so, and he did not consider that
RV required a replacement roof. The full context of Mr Manning’s
statement is that he raised with Central Coast Caravans
the possibility that
Jayco Newcastle may have advised
Consumer RH
that a new roof was
authorised, and Mr Manning was simply making the point to Central Coast
Caravans that Jayco Corp was responsible
for approving such claims under the
Jayco warranty.
Consumer MO,
the ACCC relied on the various defects in the RV and
submitted that by 7 August 2014 the defects had not been rectified
reasonable time, the RV was not fit for purpose, and a reasonable
consumer would not have purchased the RV had he or she known of
the defects. In
addition, the ACCC submitted that given the observation that the RV was not as
well put together as others at the
dealership, the Court should infer that the
RV did not match the demonstration model shown to
Consumer MO
time of purchase. The ACCC submitted that by instructing the dealer to repair
the RV and by telling
that the RV would be
repaired and that he had to give Jayco Corp a chance to fix the RV, and by
necessarily refusing to exercise
its discretion to provide a replacement RV
under the Jayco warranty, Jayco Corp unfairly obstructed
from exercising his rights under the ACL to obtain a refund or replacement from
the dealer, Jayco Sydney.
Consumer JT
, the ACCC relied on the leaking that had first
presented a few days after delivery in September 2015, which it submitted
been repaired within a reasonable time, and which was still present on
19 January 2016. The ACCC submitted that, as at that date,
did not have a solution to the cause of the leaking, and that in this
circumstance it denied
Consumer JT
’s request for a refund or
replacement RV, and in response to a request from Jayco Sydney that it advise on
a replacement, it
insisted on repairing the RV, and instructed Jayco Sydney to
order replacement parts to undertake the repairs. The ACCC submitted
Sydney acted on the advice and instructions of Jayco Corp, and in those
circumstances there was no prospect of
Consumer JT
obtaining a
refund or replacement RV in circumstances where he was entitled to do so because
a reasonable consumer would not have
purchased the RV, and it departed in
significant respects from the demonstration model shown to
Consumer JT
at the time of purchase.
Consumer TB
, the ACCC submitted that by no later than
August 2014, the defects affecting the RV had not been remedied within a
reasonable period
of time, it was not fit for purpose, and a reasonable consumer
Consumer TB
’s position would not have purchased the RV had
he or she known that it would have leaking issues from the time of delivery,
that those issues would still be affecting the RV months later despite a number
of repair attempts. The ACCC submitted that the
leaks occurred despite
representations being made to
Consumer TB
at the time of purchase
that “the benefit of a hard lid was for weather protection”. The
ACCC submitted that as well as
Consumer TB
affected by several other defects including delaminating walls. The ACCC
submitted that by instructing the dealer
to repair the RV, and by telling
Consumer TB
that the RV would be repaired and that he had to give
Jayco Corp a chance to fix the RV, and thereby necessarily refusing to exercise
its discretion to provide a replacement under the Jayco warranty, Jayco Corp
unfairly obstructed
Consumer TB
from exercising his rights under the
ACL to obtain a refund or replacement RV from the dealer, Jayco Sydney.
ACCC submitted that Jayco Corp’s conduct in responding to the
Consumers’ requests for refunds or replacement RVs occurred
through the
prism of its own commercial interests and perception of its and its
dealers’ legal responsibilities, without proper
consideration of the
rights of the Consumers under the Jayco warranty or the ACL, and without regard
to the distress and frustration
of the Consumers, of which it was aware. The
ACCC alleged that Jayco Corp’s failure to give proper consideration to the
rights to obtain a refund or replacement constituted conduct
falling below expected and acceptable standards of corporate behaviour.
submitted that knowing of the defects and the circumstances affecting the
Consumers, the way in which Jayco Corp treated each
Consumer was not only
unfair, it sufficiently departed from accepted community standards to warrant
the characterisation of conduct
against conscience.
ACCC submitted that Jayco Corp did have a role in deciding, and an ability, to
provide a replacement or refund, but told the Consumers
otherwise, and failed to
assist them in respect of their requests for replacements and refunds when
assistance was sought.
The submissions of Jayco Corp
Corp relied on the ACCC’s acceptance that it had to demonstrate that the
RVs acquired by the four Consumers were the subject
of major failures to comply
with the relevant statutory guarantees, and submitted that in no instance was
there a major failure.
Those submissions fall away in relation to
Consumer MO
Consumer JT
Consumer TB
because I have determined in relation to those Consumers that there was a
major failure to comply with a relevant statutory guarantee.
to whether, on the assumption that there were major failures, Jayco Corp engaged
in unconscionable conduct in relation to the Consumers,
Jayco Corp addressed the
three elements of the ACCC’s allegation of unconscionable conduct in
paragraph [8] of its concise
statement (see [
] above), namely that Jayco
(1) refused to exercise its discretion under the Jayco
warranty to provide a replacement RV;
(2) pressed the position that the only remedy available to the Consumers was
another attempt at a repair, regardless of the number
of unsuccessful previous
attempts; and
(3) unfairly obstructed the Consumers from obtaining a refund or replacement RV
from the relevant Jayco dealer, to which they were
entitled under the
Corp submitted that there was no meaningful distinction between the first two
elements of [8] of the ACCC’s concise statement,
and that they were
untenable. In relation to the matters in
of the ACL to which regard
must be had where relevant, Jayco Corp submitted that only two were engaged by
the allegations made by
the ACCC in its concise statement, namely that each of
the four Consumers was in a very weak bargaining position compared to Jayco
(s 22(1)(a))
, and that Jayco Corp did not act in good faith
(s 22(1)(l)).
Jayco Corp submitted that the evidence was not probative of
their being any disparity in bargaining position. Jayco Corp submitted
of the Consumers had recourse to New South Wales Fair Trading, against the
dealers as suppliers, and that three of the
four Consumers pursued that avenue.
In the alternative, Jayco Corp relied on the statement of Keane J in
Paciocco HCA
at [293] that “[t]he existence of a disparity in
bargaining power, which is an all-pervading feature of a capitalist economy,
does not establish that the party which enjoys the superior power acts
unconscionably by exercising it.”
to the ACCC’s allegation of lack of good faith at [30.9] of its concise
statement, Jayco Corp submitted that it lacked articulation
and was circular
because it did no more than pick up the three elements of the ACCC’s case
that it had alleged at paragraph
[8] of its concise statement. Jayco Corp
submitted that accordingly, the allegation of absence of good faith lacked
substance as
an independent ground on which to characterise its conduct as
unconscionable. Jayco Corp further submitted that there was no allegation
the terms of the Jayco warranty were unfair, and there was no evidence that
Jayco Corp failed to exercise its discretion under
the Jayco warranty to replace
an RV in the pursuit of some dishonest, capricious, arbitrary, or extraneous
Corp submitted that, self-evidently, it was not unconscionable for the purposes
of the ACL for Jayco Corp to have simply made an error about
whether a failure to comply with a statutory consumer guarantee was
failure. It followed that it could not be unconscionable to form and maintain
the view that a repair was an appropriate remedy
in accordance with the terms of
the warranty. Nor was it unconscionable for Jayco Corp to require that claims be
investigated. Jayco
Corp pointed to the terms of its warranty that I have set
] above, which are
engaged if any part of the RV is
to be defective.
at a more general level Jayco Corp submitted that there are no criteria in
of the ACL that make it unconscionable for a manufacturer to have a
lawful warranty process that has the effect of creating a commercial
for suppliers to give priority to a manufacturer’s warranty process rather
than their direct legal obligations under
the ACL. Jayco Corp submitted that
most manufacturers of products which are sold in Australia offer express
warranties on their products,
of the ACL recognises this very
common phenomenon. Jayco Corp submitted that to attack this commonplace
phenomenon using the law
of unconscionability under the ACL was “perverse
and bizarre” because the ACL, which was the very law which set up and
recognised this structure of obligations, was being used to subvert it. Jayco
Corp submitted that the absurdity of the ACCC’s
case was illustrated if
one considered that, on its logic, the more generous Jayco Corp’s warranty
terms or practice were,
the more likely it was financially expedient for
suppliers to confine themselves to the warranty in responding to
claims, and therefore the more likely it became that Jayco Corp
would act unconscionably. Jayco Corp submitted that this contradicted
assumptions that underlie the structure of the consumer guarantee provisions of
the ACL, namely that –
(1) manufacturers may offer express contractual
warranties; and
(2) suppliers are subject to compulsory statutory
guarantees.
Corp submitted that the two sets of obligations overlapped, and must operate
harmoniously. Jayco Corp submitted that it could
not be unconscionable for the
three interested parties: manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers, to interact
in the normal way when
endeavouring to resolve defect claims. Jayco Corp
submitted that in any event the evidence showed that the Consumers were not
by Jayco Corp in any way from obtaining any relief under the ACL to
which they may have been entitled.
Corp submitted that the ACCC made no allegation that it had asserted any
contractual or other control, or otherwise exercised
any undue influence or
acted unconscionably towards the suppliers, namely Jayco Sydney and Jayco
Newcastle. Jayco Corp submitted
that the ACCC’s case rose no higher than
alleging circumstances where it was financially expedient for suppliers to
to claims by consumers by invoking the manufacturer’s warranty on
their behalf.
Jayco Corp submitted that its treatment of each of the four Consumers was
conscientious, urgent, and directed towards solving
their problems. Jayco Corp
submitted that its general practices in dealing with claims under the Jayco
warranty, and the terms of
the Jayco warranty, were entirely consistent with
generally accepted community values.
its supplementary written submissions, Jayco Corp submitted that in some
respects, the ACCC’s case as closed went beyond
its pleadings. At [
] above, I have held that to be so in
relation to the ACCC’s reliance on s 259(2) of the ACL. Otherwise,
the submissions of
Jayco Corp about the scope of the ACCC’s pleaded case
tended to escalate what were matters of obvious contextual background,
nuance, and degree, into significant issues that had to be specifically pleaded.
I do not find it necessary to consider
further those submissions.
The matrix of statutory rights and obligations
returning to consider further the evidence, it is necessary to make some
observations about the statutory context of the ACCC’s
unconscionable conduct which, as I mentioned at [
] above, is significant.
time to time, the High Court has spoken about the desire for coherence of legal
principle in the development of the common law,
the concern being for legal
principles to operate in a consistent way: see, eg,
Tame v New South Wales
[2002] HCA 35
211 CLR 317
(McHugh J);
Hill v Van Erp
[1997] HCA 9
188 CLR 159
at 231 (Gummow J);
Mann v Paterson
Constructions Pty Ltd
[2019] HCA 32
(Kiefel CJ, Bell and Keane JJ). Coherence is also sought in the
interpretation of legislative instruments, for they must be
construed on the
prima facie
basis that their provisions are intended to give effect to
harmonious goals:
Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority
[1998] HCA 28
; 194 CLR 355 at
(McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and
Hayne JJ). Therefore, in relation to determining whether conduct is
unconscionable for the purposes of
of the ACL, it is relevant to
consider other laws, including other provisions of the ACL:
following features of the ACL are relevant to the evaluation of the conduct of
Jayco Corp alleged by the ACCC. In some of the
provisions to which I refer, the
ACL uses the defined term “affected person”, which includes a
consumer who acquires
goods (see [
] above). For the sake of simplicity, I
shall refer below to such persons as consumers.
and as I have already mentioned, the liabilities respectively of a supplier and
a manufacturer of goods under the ACL have different
content. Without being
exhaustive, the following differences are material –
(1) in the case of a failure to comply with the
statutory guarantees of acceptable quality [s 54], fitness for a disclosed
[s 55], or non-compliance with description [s 56], only the
supplier is directly liable to a consumer under s 261 to remedy the failure
by repairing the goods, replacing the goods, or giving a refund;
(2) in the case of a failure to comply with a statutory guarantee that cannot be
remedied or which is a major failure, only the supplier
is liable under
s 263(4) to refund the purchase price, or to replace the goods at the
election of the consumer;
(3) a supplier is not liable to a consumer to remedy a manufacturer’s
non-compliance with the statutory guarantee under
that an express
warranty of a manufacturer will be complied with [s 259(1)];
(4) on the other hand, subject to some qualifications that are set out in
s 271, a manufacturer is liable to a consumer in
(a) for non-compliance with the statutory
guarantee of acceptable quality under
[s 271(1)];
(b) for non-compliance with the statutory guarantee of correspondence with
description, where the description was applied by or on
behalf of, or with the
consent of, the manufacturer [s 271(3)]; and
(c) for a failure to comply with the statutory guarantee under
the manufacturer will comply with an express warranty given by it
[s 271(5)]; and
(5) a consumer’s entitlement to commence a
proceeding for damages against a manufacturer is qualified by the condition that
where a consumer has, in accordance with an express warranty, required the
manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply with a relevant
guarantee, the
manufacturer must have refused or failed within a reasonable time to remedy the
failure to comply with the relevant
statutory guarantee
[s 271(6)].
was no allegation by the ACCC that, in the context of s 271(6) of the ACL,
Jayco Corp had acted unconscionably in refusing or
failing within a reasonable
time to remedy a failure to comply with any of the relevant consumer guarantees.
It was not put squarely
to any of the Jayco Corp witnesses that he had acted in
bad faith in the consideration of the claims of the four Consumers, and as
have mentioned at [
the ACCC did not present its case in final submissions as one of conscious
wrongdoing by Jayco Corp.
apart from its direct liability to a consumer in damages, a manufacturer also
has a statutory liability under s 274 of the ACL,
to which I referred
] above, to indemnify a
supplier if the supplier is liable to a consumer in damages, or incurs costs in
respect of a failure to comply
with one of the statutory guarantees to which
s 274 applies, which relevantly include the guarantee of acceptable quality
The liability under s 274 is a liability to indemnify the
supplier for damages payable, or costs incurred by the supplier, and is
terms a liability to reimburse the retail price, or to replace the goods.
Pursuant to s 276(1), and subject to s 276A, this
statutory liability
cannot be excluded, but in cases where there is a contract for the sale of goods
made between the supplier and
the manufacturer, it will sit with any other
rights that a supplier has against a manufacturer, including for breach of any
terms, or any conditions or warranties that are implied by statute, or
general law, into the contractual arrangements between the
supplier and the
manufacturer.
it follows from the terms of the statutory indemnity referred to above that the
liability of a supplier to a consumer, and the liability
of a manufacturer to a
supplier, may not directly correspond. Let it be supposed that upon the
rejection of goods by a consumer on
account of a major failure, a supplier is
liable to the consumer to refund the purchase price. The supplier may refund the
price to that consumer, and may then be able to repair the goods and
re-sell them to another consumer. In that example, the manufacturer
liable to the supplier for the purchase price, but may be liable for the costs
incurred in repairing the goods, and for any
loss on re-sale.
the statutory guarantee in
of the ACL that a manufacturer will
comply with an express warranty has significance, because it is a recognition
that the obligations
under a manufacturer’s express warranty, and the
entitlement of a consumer to enforce direct obligations under the ACL against
the supplier or the manufacturer, may sit side by side. Further recognition of
this feature of the matrix of obligations arising
under the ACL is given by
of the ACL, to which I referred at [
] above, which authorises the
prescription by regulation of requirements relating to the form and content of
non-statutory warranties
against defects.
to this fourth point, I mention here that the ACCC submitted in support of its
claim that Jayco Corp engaged in conduct that
was unconscionable by obstructing
the Consumers from exercising their rights under the ACL, that the Jayco
owner’s handbook,
while referring to rights under the ACL, did not specify
the circumstances in which consumers would be entitled to a refund or
replacement
under the ACL, and did not specify against whom such rights were
exercisable. The ACCC submitted that the handbook did not distinguish,
adequately, the rights and obligations under the Jayco warranty from the
consumers’ rights under the ACL, and it did
not make clear that the Jayco
warranty could not, and could not be used to, prevent or obstruct consumers from
exercising any right
to obtain a refund or replacement from a Jayco dealer under
the ACL. The ACCC submitted that the handbook conveyed an impression
warranty had primacy over any rights that a consumer may have under the ACL in
respect of “defects”.
do not accept the ACCC’s submissions concerning the adequacy of references
to the ACL in the owner’s handbook. The operative
terms of the Jayco
warranty appear to be unremarkable for warranties of that type. Senior counsel
for the ACCC accepted in submissions
that manufacturers’ warranties have
always existed, and that the nature of the Jayco warranty was not out of the
and that at one level manufacturers’ warranties are something
which are of utility and benefit to consumers. The ACCC did not
claim that the
existence or operative terms of the Jayco warranty were the product of
unconscionable conduct. And it was no part
of the ACCC’s case that the
text of the Jayco warranty document did not comply with the requirements of
reg 90 of the
Competition and Consumer Regulations
. As I stated
] above, the references to the ACL in
the owner’s handbook followed the prescription of the
Competition and
Consumer Regulations
. In light of the regulatory prescription of the content
of the warranty document in relation to its references to the ACL, the
submissions on this issue must be rejected.
the ACL gives effect to any benefits that may be given by a manufacturer’s
warranty by making compliance with the warranty
another statutory guarantee:
s 59(1). The Jayco warranty appears to provide benefits to consumers that
they do not enjoy under the
ACL alone. The first benefit is some certainty of
language. Without detracting from rights under the ACL, the operative section of
the Jayco warranty states, subject to exclusions, but in reasonably plain terms,
that all parts of the RV should be free from defects
in material and workmanship
for a period of 12 months from purchase, and provides for either repair or
replacement at the discretion
of Jayco Corp. The duration of the warranty of 12
months is certain. That formulation may be compared with the more elaborate
of the ACL that require value judgments, and which span different
parts of the ACL, over many pages, in Schedule 2 of the
Competition and
Consumer Act
second benefit is that the Jayco warranty invites the consumer to engage it by
making an appointment at any Jayco dealer or service
agent. This is likely to be
of advantage to those using an RV when travelling, so that they might exercise
rights under the Jayco
warranty through dealers or service agents throughout
Australia. In contrast, the right under the ACL to require a supplier to remedy
a failure to comply with a statutory guarantee may not be so easily exercised,
or be of as much practical utility, particularly if
a failure occurs while the
consumer is travelling. And the liability of the manufacturer in damages may
also be of less practical
utility than a warranty to repair or replace through
authorised service agents in the event of a breakdown.
third benefit is that the existence of specific obligations of a manufacturer
under a warranty, in addition to those rights exercisable
by a consumer against
the manufacturer under the ACL, may provide additional comfort to consumers who
may not be fully informed about
the financial state of affairs of a supplier,
and who may be at risk in the event of the insolvency of a supplier.
point of the above discussion is to place in context elements of the claims by
the ACCC that Jayco Corp acted unconscionably by
considering consumer claims
through the lens of its obligations under the Jayco warranty.
How did Jayco Corp address requests for repairs, refunds and
replacements?
have summarised the core elements of the evidence concerning the ACCC’s
claim that the Consumers were entitled to reject the
RVs, and to seek refunds or
replacements. It is necessary to consider further some of the evidence about the
manner in which Jayco
Corp addressed consumer claims for repairs, refunds, and
replacement RVs. That examination is necessary so that the dealings between
Jayco Corp, the Jayco dealers, and the Consumers may be placed in context, as a
consideration of all the circumstances for the purposes
of s 21 of the ACL
I have mentioned at [103] to [108] above, Jayco Corp adduced evidence from
current and former employees who were engaged in the
assessment of its warranty
claims: Mr Manning, Mr Rigby, Mr Austin, Mr Morgan, and
Mr Murphy. Their evidence included evidence about
Jayco Corp’s
general practices in the assessment of warranty claims. In addition, Jayco Corp
called the dealer principals of
Jayco Sydney and Jayco Newcastle:
Mr Bilbija and Mr Charleson. They gave evidence about general
practices from their perspective.
Corp employed a team of warranty, or “after sales”, staff based in
Dandenong. The team generally consisted of three
customer service managers
reporting to the customer relationship manager, who in turn reported to the
national service manager, who
at the times relevant to this proceeding was
Mr Morgan. In turn, Mr Morgan reported to Mr Murphy. It was
Mr Murphy’s practice
generally to speak to the warranty team every
morning to ask how claims were sitting, whether any difficult claims had arisen,
how the team was progressing. In addition, Mr Austin, and later
Mr Rigby, Mr Manning and Mr Morgan met weekly to discuss the
stated that as RVs were essentially hand-assembled products with a significant
number of parts, he expected that from time
to time items would require
attention. He stated that it was not unusual to receive two to three warranty
claims from a dealer for
stated that a significant proportion of enquiries to the after sales team
related to requests from dealers and owners for
authorisation for the repair of
owners’ RVs, replacement of RVs, and requests for refunds of the purchase
price. Mr Morgan
stated that the requests from dealers and owners were
generally framed as warranty claims, or as claims under the ACL.
was no formal policy, such as any written policy, followed by Jayco Corp in
dealing with warranty claims. With reference to
the terms of the Jayco warranty
that provided for a discretion to replace an RV, or a defective part of an RV,
Mr Morgan stated that
there was no directive, requirement, or policy within
Jayco Corp that repairs had to be pushed to dealers or owners in preference
replacements. Mr Morgan stated that the practice was to assess every case
on its merits. Mr Austin gave evidence to similar effect.
He stated that
that he did not believe that there was any formal or informal policy to prefer
repairs to refunds or replacements,
and that in his experience, each RV and
circumstance was assessed on a case-by-case basis. However, Mr Austin
stated that it was
logical as a general position that if something could be
easily repaired, “we would repair it”. Mr Austin also stated
that it was his understanding that Jayco Corp was entitled under the terms of
its warranty to repair the RV if that was possible.
Mr Austin also referred
to consumers being unaware of how easily issues can be resolved without
resorting to a replacement RV, which
could take weeks to rebuild and
stated that for claims other than automated claims, Jayco Corp required that the
dealer or owner provide sufficient information
in support of any claim under the
warranty for a manufacturing defect. This generally took the form of
photographs, copies of service
records, an inspection report, details of where
and how the RV had been stored and used, and any other relevant information and
quotation for repairs. Mr Morgan stated that in his view, this
information was critical.
instances where the dealer or repair agent was unsure of the cause of the
problem, the scope of the repair, or whether the repair
was covered under the
warranty, and in cases where the cost of the repair exceeded the dealer’s
approved limits, the dealer
would typically submit a request for warranty
approval to Jayco Corp prior to undertaking the repairs. The Jayco Corp warranty
reviewed requests for approval. Once the warranty team determined to
approve a request for warranty works, it became a warranty claim.
When a dealer
or service agent conducted repairs under warranty that were authorised, Jayco
Corp paid the dealer or service agent
for the labour, and usually supplied the
stated that in almost all cases where approached by a consumer directly, he
would refer the consumer to a local dealer or
repair agent to have the problems
or concerns with the RV assessed. He stated that he could not see the RV
himself, so it was practically
impossible to assess the RV otherwise. He stated
that usually the dealer or agent would provide Jayco Corp with an explanation of
the customer’s concerns, the dealer or agent’s technical assessment
of any defects, photographs of the problem, their
recommendations as to the best
way to fix the problem, and their quotation for the repairs if appropriate.
Mr Manning’s
perspective was that the assessment of any warranty claim involved consideration
of whether the customer was covered
under the Jayco warranty, whether the
problem was a manufacturing fault, whether the problem could be easily repaired,
the cost of
repair, and whether repair was the best solution, including having
regard to the customer’s history and experience with the
assessment was guided by the information provided by the dealers, who were
expected to provide relevant information, including
a detailed quotation for
repairs over $1,000. Mr Manning stated that it was his experience that
customers tended to make warranty
claims at the Jayco dealer from which the RV
was purchased. In some instances, requests were made to Jayco Corp directly, in
case it was usual practice, as Mr Morgan had stated, to refer the
consumer to a Jayco dealer where the issue could be assessed.
stated that dealers sought information from Jayco Corp about the nature of an
issue that was presented, the causes, what
fixes or repairs might be available,
and the likely cost. Mr Rigby stated that Jayco Corp handled a larger
volume of repairs and
services than each dealer, and had a research and
development department which improved design and investigated and developed
for common faults as they arose.
stated that Jayco Corp preferred the selling dealer to take care of the customer
complaints, expecting that the dealer would
inform Jayco Corp of the customer's
concerns, assess the RV, provide recommendations, and act on Jayco Corp’s
behalf once it
had told the dealer how it had decided to respond to the
complaint. In most cases, the dealer would conduct the repairs that Jayco
had approved, pass on a rebuild that had been manufactured by Jayco Corp in
Dandenong, or provide a replacement RV, for which
Jayco Corp would reimburse the
dealer. Jayco Corp gave dealers standing authority to conduct repairs under
Warranty up to a cost
Jayco Corp witnesses’ understanding the operation of
of the issues on which the Jayco Corp witnesses gave evidence was their
understanding of the operation of the ACL. The understanding
displayed by each
of them varied. Unsurprisingly, the degree of understanding presented by some of
the witnesses was practical and
incomplete.
stated that he, along with other staff, had received regular training relating
to the ACL, mostly from Jayco Corp’s
solicitors. Mr Murphy produced
some PowerPoint slides from a presentation dated 5 February 2016. The
slides referred to the statutory
guarantees under the ACL, and noted that they
could not be excluded. In relation to remedies, one of the slides stated as
“Minor” failure
Consumer may require the supplier (dealer) to
remedy within a reasonable time OR
If refused/not done/not done promptly
consumer can remedy themselves and
recover costs OR
consumer can reject the goods (refund or
replacement)
"Major" failure
(substantial)
Consumer can reject the goods (refund or
replacement) OR
Consumer can recover compensation for reduction in
Additionally – consumer can recover
reasonably foreseeable loss and damage
stated in cross-examination that he did not have a detailed understanding of the
ACL, and that he had a greater knowledge
of the Jayco warranty than the ACL. In
particular, he stated that he had a limited understanding of what was a major
failure for
the purpose of the ACL. He gave evidence of his understanding of the
difference between a major and minor “defect” under
the ACL. He
stated that something that was cosmetic or not affecting the use of the RV, or
something that was easily repairable was
likely to be a minor defect, unless it
was a combination of a large number of minor issues, or a repeated minor issue
not be properly fixed. Mr Murphy stated that a major defect
would generally be something that prevented use of the RV for its intended
purpose that was not easily and quickly rectifiable. Mr Murphy gave the
example of a leak. He stated that a leak may be either a
major or minor defect
depending on the nature, location, and effect of the leak. He stated that any
serious safety issue would likely
be a major defect, although again, each case
needed to be considered on its own merits. For example, the failure of tail or
lights is a serious safety issue but was usually very easily repaired and
was not a major defect. Mr Murphy accepted in cross-examination
something was assessed as a minor defect (meaning something easily repaired), it
would be Jayco Corp’s practice to
authorise repairs to be effected.
gave evidence that he, along with other after sales staff, also undertook
regular consumer law training that was delivered
by Jayco Corp’s
solicitors. He produced a copy of what he described as some of the training
materials, but there was no reference
in those materials to the topic of the
respective obligations of Jayco Corp and the dealers under the Jayco warranty or
Mr Morgan stated in his affidavit that his understanding of the
operation of the ACL was that there was a distinction between major
failures, and that this affected the remedies to which owners were entitled. He
stated that where the issue required a
major repair or was unable to be repaired
within a reasonable time, the owner could request a refund or replacement from
the selling
dealer. Otherwise, the issue could be remedied with repair at first
instance. Mr Morgan explained that personally, he tended to equate
repair job to a minor failure within the meaning of the ACL, and a big repair
job to a major failure. However, he stated
that he considered that the best
response to each case depended upon its own circumstances, and that major and
minor issues were
reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
stated that he understood that Jayco Corp had obligations under the ACL that
stood independently from the Jayco warranty.
He also stated that he understood
that selling dealers bore the obligation to replace or refund owners where an
entitlement to a
refund was made out. Mr Morgan stated that he understood
that Jayco Corp could then be liable to indemnify the selling dealer, and
thereby understood that Jayco Corp could have liabilities in relation to refunds
to owners in addition to its liabilities under the
stated that while he had received some training in the ACL which had been
conducted by Jayco Corp’s solicitors, he
did not when appointed as the
service manager make decisions to repair, refund, or replace RVs, and at that
time the ACL was not
particularly relevant to his role. He stated in
cross-examination that his position as customer relations manager was not
dissimilar,
although the ACL was more relevant in that role. He stated that his
practice was to refer any issues that related to the ACL to other
staff at Jayco
stated that he also had attended consumer law training sessions presented by
Jayco Corp’s solicitors, which outlined
sellers’ and
manufacturers’ obligations under the ACL. In cross-examination, he
conceded some understanding of the components
of the ACL, but not a good
understanding, and he also accepted that he did not know enough about the ACL to
say whether there was
any obligation on Jayco Corp under the ACL to refund money
to a consumer. Mr Austin was taken in cross-examination to his handling
one particular claim which he accepted was consistent with the practice that he
would not be authorised to refund the purchase
price or to replace the RV unless
there was a major structural or safety-related issue. Mr Austin agreed in
cross-examination that
in the 15 years prior to his retirement on
24 July 2015, the instructions that he received from senior management
with respect to
refunds or replacements were consistently to the effect that
they would not be authorised unless there were safety, major structural,
safety issues. Mr Austin stated that, “... if a van is easily
repaired, you repair it.”
Mr Manning’s
evidence was that in his experience, most problems that were experienced in an
RV could be repaired by the dealer
or a service agent, and that it was very rare
that an RV had to come back to “head office”. He stated that he
a fault to be a major fault where it rendered the RV unusable for an
extended period of time, where the RV posed health or safety
issues, or where
the cost of repairs was high relative to the purchase price of the RV.
Otherwise, his evidence was of a practice
that if the defects were repairable,
then from the perspective of his role, and the limitations on his authority,
that was the course
that Jayco Corp required be followed, which was in turn
communicated to the dealer in the understanding it would be passed on to
customer. It is important that Mr Manning qualified this evidence by
stating that he was speaking “from my role and my
limits”, and that
“if it went above, management might have made a different
formed the view that, of the Jayco Corp witnesses, Mr Morgan appeared to
have the best grasp of the relevant concepts. He had a
clear understanding that
the liability under the ACL for a refund or for replacement goods attached to
the dealer. However, the picture
presented by the evidence was that the members
of the Jayco Corp warranty team had an imperfect understanding of the operation
the ACL. The main deficiency was that there was no express reference in the
evidence to any criterion akin to that contained in s
260(a) of the ACL,
that is, whether the goods would not have been acquired by a reasonable consumer
fully acquainted with the nature
and extent of a failure to comply with a
statutory guarantee. Having said that, one of the touchstones that the witnesses
namely the ease with which repairs could be effected, was not at all
foreign to the ACL. It was relevant to whether there was a major
failure on the
ground of unfitness for purpose, and although no witness made this point
expressly, the ease with which any failure
might be remedied was relevant to the
tolerance of the reasonable consumer as I have explained at [
] above. And all the witnesses were of
the view that each claim had to be considered on a case-by-case basis, which as
a general proposition
is unexceptionable.
Requests for replacement RVs or refunds
stated that Jayco Corp had provided replacement RVs to consumers directly under
the Jayco warranty in a variety of circumstances.
Mr Rigby produced some
spreadsheets identifying the rebuilds (meaning that a consumer’s RV was
rebuilt to that consumer’s
specifications so that it could be provided as
a replacement RV) and refunds that Jayco Corp had made for 2013
to 2015, and for part
of 2016. Those spreadsheets recorded
(1) 20 rebuilds or refunds for 2013;
(2) 14 rebuilds or refunds for 2014;
(3) 15 rebuilds or refunds for 2015; and
(4) 18 rebuilds or refunds for 2016.
spreadsheets recorded a variety of reasons for the rebuilds or refunds, and in
respect of about half, they recorded instances
of water ingress. Additionally,
Mr Rigby produced some spreadsheets recording 22 instances of dealers
who had agreed to refunds or
rebuilds in the same period. In many instances, the
documents record some contribution from Jayco Corp.
of the warranty team below Mr Murphy did not have authority to authorise
replacement RVs, or to indemnify dealers in respect
of refunds. In order for
Mr Murphy or some other person authorised to make the decision to consider
a request for a replacement RV,
the claim and associated information had to be
escalated. In relation to claims for replacement RVs, Mr Rigby,
Mr Austin, and Mr
Manning each gave evidence substantially to the
effect that they would compile information for presentation to Mr Morgan
and Mr Murphy.
Mr Morgan stated that in order to have all the
information to make a decision, he required –
(1) a quotation to fix the RV to a level that the owner
would accept;
(2) a quotation to repair the RV to a level whereby it could be sold as a
second-hand unit; and
(3) the contribution that the dealer was requesting from Jayco
stated that he did not recall ever providing Mr Morgan or any other staff
member with any general instructions as to what
data he required to consider a
request for a refund or replacement RV, but from a practical perspective, he
understood that any RV
with a reported problem would be physically assessed by
someone to determine exactly what, if anything, was wrong with the RV, and
assess of the magnitude and cost of the repairs, to consider whether a repair
should or could be completed, or if it was more
appropriate to replace the RV or
provide financial assistance to the dealer providing a refund.
weight of the evidence was that if a consumer contacted Jayco Corp directly
seeking a replacement RV, or a refund, the practice
was to refer the consumer to
their selling dealer. This was for reasons including that the dealer had the
contract of sale, the dealer
had the existing relationship with the consumer and
could address the consumer’s concerns, and that an assessment of the RV
had to be undertaken, resulting in the provision of information including
quotations and photographs so that a fully informed decision
could be made.
Thereafter, there was no formal process as such, but an assessment of the
relevant documents was usually made with
the staff at the relevant level of
authorisation, including Mr Morgan, Mr Murphy, or the CEO.
stated that during the relevant period, and until he retired, where a
replacement RV, warranty repairs, or a refund was
requested, Jayco Corp would
review the claim on a case-by-case basis, considering its warranty obligations,
and its ACL obligations.
Mr Murphy stated that while the process was
informal, some of the factors that would be taken into account
(1) whether there was a manufacturing defect;
(2) whether the claim was by the customer under the Jayco warranty or by the
dealer for reimbursement for repairs, replacements or
refunds under the ACL;
(3) if the claim was by the customer under the Jayco warranty, whether the
customer was the original owner, and the van was within
the warranty period and
the terms of the warranty had been complied with;
(4) whether the manufacturing defect was repairable;
(5) if the manufacturing defect was repairable, what the time frame would be for
(6) what the cost would be for a repair;
(7) what the outcome of the repair would be, both cosmetically and
functionally;
(8) how difficult a repair would be, and whether it could be done locally or
could only be done by head office, at the Jayco Corp
factory in Dandenong;
(9) whether there had been past repairs on the RV, and whether it had a good
service history;
(10) if the manufacturing defect was not repairable, or could only be done with
significant cost, extensive work, or long delay,
what outcome the customer was
seeking, such as a replacement RV, trade-in or refund;
(11) whether there had been any inappropriate use of the RV relevant to the
(12) the customer's experience with the defect and the process more
(13) whether the customer had existing travel plans that would require the use
of the van; and
(14) whether the van was usable or whether the repair or other outcome needed to
be done urgently due to safety or other concerns.
to some specific instances of claims for a refund or replacement,
Mr Manning was taken in cross-examination to some email exchanges
to claims involving other consumers. Mr Manning was taken to an email
communication in February 2016 with a consumer, who
was not one of the four
Consumers, which illustrated Mr Manning’s practice of referring
consumers to their selling dealer when
they requested a refund. The consumer
later informed Mr Manning in March 2016 that the dealer would not
refund the purchase price,
and in response Mr Manning advised the consumer
that he could help with warranty on Jayco manufacturing faults, but that,
per the warranty terms and conditions Jayco will only be repairing
under warranty. No replacing the van.”
was also taken to an email communication to another dealer on
4 June 2014 in relation to a consumer who had requested a
full refund,
or a replacement RV, or repairs at no cost to him in terms of the travel time
involved in returning the RV to the dealer
for the repairs. Mr Manning
stated to the dealer, “There will be no new van or refund given due to
warranty repairs. That is
what the warranty is there for; repairs only”.
Mr Manning denied that, across the board, this was his perception of the
but accepted that what he wrote was an incomplete description of the
was taken to an email communication on 1 December 2015 with another
consumer, who had complained that a new Jayco camper
that she had acquired was
missing some anchor bolts, the repairs to which involved removing the kitchen
section in circumstances
where the consumer wished to use the RV to go away
before and after Christmas. The consumer requested a refund to which
responded, “There will not be a replacement van or money
back. Jayco warranty is to repair the van only. Please have Nowra
they believe it to be a Jayco manufacturing fault. Then we can approve if
it’s over their limit.” Mr Manning
agreed that this also was an
incomplete description of the terms of the Jayco warranty.
was taken to a further email exchange with an RV service centre in Nowra
concerning the RV of a consumer who reported a
number of problems with his new
Jayco RV, including water leakage, and bubbling plywood. There was no request in
terms for a replacement
RV, although there is reference in the email exchange to
the consumer having already obtained a replacement RV, and it appears that
was the replacement RV that was affected. In an email to the service centre
dated 28 February 2013, Mr Manning stated –
He will need to put in writing his thoughts or requests. As far as you and I
stand we can only authorise repairing this under warranty.
Jayco will want your
report and quotes if the owner is demanding money back or replacement van. No
guarantees though. It would be
between your senior management and ours.
Please don’t say anything to owner
He needs to decide for himself how he wants to deal with it other than repairs.
I’m confident Jayco will only authorise repairs on this van.
(Emphasis in original)
reference to this email, Mr Manning agreed in cross-examination that as a
matter of common practice, in the event that an owner
asked a dealer for a
refund or a replacement RV, the dealer would then discuss it with senior
management at Jayco Corp. Mr Manning
also stated that if a consumer
approached Jayco Corp directly seeking a refund or replacement RV, then he had
been instructed by
Mr Morgan to refer the consumer back to the dealer, who
would then take the matter up with Jayco Corp management. When put to him,
Mr Manning did not accept that this process was to be characterised as
Jayco Corp’s role generally in the decision of a
dealer whether to replace an RV or to refund the purchase price

consumers seeking refunds or replacement RVs back to their
selling dealer, who
for the purposes of the ACL was the supplier. A related issue raised by the
ACCC’s case was an allegation
that Jayco Corp controlled the
decision-making process undertaken by the selling dealer.

was cross-examined about the list referred to at [
] above, and stated that the list was
issued to dealers. Mr Morgan consistently rejected the proposition, which
was put to him in
a number of ways in cross-examination, that the document had
the effect that a decision by a dealer to supply a replacement RV or
refund required the approval of Mr Murphy, Mr McGowan, or
Mr Bizon. Mr Morgan explained that the document was concerned
relations between Jayco Corp and the dealers. He stated that what the dealers
did with the customers was the dealer’s
choice: “the dealership
makes that decision through the ACL”. Mr Morgan was firm in his
evidence that it was not the
practice of Jayco Corp to push its decisions as to
whether to repair or replace onto the dealer, stating that there were so many
circumstances around every repair, and that Jayco Corp had never stopped dealers
from agreeing to a refund or replacement and seeking
financial contribution
afterwards. Mr Morgan’s evidence in this regard was credible and
reliable. The evidence was supported
by documentary evidence to which I shall
refer below, and the evidence of the two dealer principals who were called,
Mr Bilbija of
Jayco Sydney and Mr Charleson of Jayco Newcastle, to
which I shall also refer below. Mr Morgan stated that he could not recall
instance where a dealer provided a repair, replacement, or refund to a
consumer on the basis of an ACL claim concerning a manufacturing
defect, and
Jayco Corp had subsequently refused to assist the dealer.
reference to the terms of the Jayco warranty that provided Jayco Corp with a
discretion to replace an RV, or a defective part
of an RV, Mr Morgan stated
that there was no directive, requirement or policy within Jayco Corp that
repairs had to be pushed to
dealers or owners in preference to replacements.
Mr Morgan stated that the practice was to assess every case on its merits.
In cross-examination,
Mr Morgan did not agree that it was inevitable that a
dealer would raise the question of a refund or replacement RV as part of the
warranty process, but stated that it was common that a dealer faced with an
owner’s request for a repair, replacement, or refund
would do so prior to
making a decision itself. He agreed that in the case of a manufacturing defect,
dealers would generally contact
Jayco Corp and speak to it about the situation,
and would do so as a matter of course during the 12 month warranty period.
He described
the process as one of collaboration as far as what level of repairs
needed to be undertaken. He separated this from the dealer’s
decision as
to what it proposed to do, and the financial elements of that decision. He
emphasised that every single RV has a different
circumstance, and stated that it
was the dealers’ decision as to what course they would take, because it
was their call.
his part, Mr Murphy stated that it was his understanding that Jayco Corp
played no role in a dealer’s decision to replace
an RV, other than to
provide advice if asked for it, including advice about available repairs or
problem fixes, or to determine whether
Jayco Corp would make a financial
contribution to the dealer's decision to refund for non-manufacturing reasons.
Mr Murphy stated
that if a dealer had wanted to provide a refund or
replacement at any time, it was entitled to do so. As with Mr Morgan, it
to Mr Murphy in cross-examination by reference to the list referred
] above that a dealer
could not itself replace an RV for a consumer without Jayco Corp’s
approval. Mr Murphy responded, “No.
The dealer could do that, if they
wished.” Mr Murphy stated that Jayco Corp and the Jayco dealers
understood that dealers would
be required to provide replacements or refunds to
consumers where necessary under the ACL. He stated that in practice, dealers
sought prior confirmation from Jayco Corp, either that it would deal
with the claim under the Jayco warranty, or that it would support
the dealers
with reimbursement for refunds, or the provision of rebuilds or replacement RVs,
or some other assistance for their customer,
on a case-by-case basis. He stated
that dealers, nonetheless, often provided replacements or refunds to their
customers without involving
Jayco Corp at all in the first instance, but then
worked out a financial arrangement afterwards. However, in cross-examination,
Murphy accepted that this was not common.
to practical matters, Mr Murphy agreed that dealers were at the front line
in terms of the interaction with customers, and that
in relation to
manufacturing defects, a dealer would be keen to ensure that Jayco Corp would
take responsibility financially for
any costs of rectification or otherwise
dealing with manufacturing defects, and accepted that this was just ordinary
business sense.
stated that so far as he could recall, he had never expressed to a dealer or
customer that Jayco Corp had any influence or
control over a dealer’s
decision to refund or replace. He stated that it was a matter for the dealers
themselves if they wanted
to replace an RV or provide a refund, and stated that
on some occasions, dealers had provided a refund or replacement RV to a
and then approached Jayco Corp afterwards to ascertain whether Jayco
Corp would contribute to the cost of doing so.
was put to Mr Austin that in respect of a serious problem, such as a
problem that would give rise to an obligation on a dealer
to refund the purchase
price, or to replace the RV, that the dealer would as a matter of ordinary
business practice contact Jayco
Corp. Mr Austin responded by stating that
some dealers did, and some dealers made their own decisions. He later said that
dealers would seek some sort of advice, but stated that the dealers
ultimately made the decision on which way they wanted to go.
resisted the proposition that dealers had to obtain approval from Jayco Corp
before offering a refund, characterising the
position as one of seeking advice.
However, Mr Austin agreed that claims under the Jayco warranty had to be
approved by Jayco Corp,
and that if that involved replacing the RV, or refunding
the purchase price, it had to be approved at a level of authority higher
evidence of Mr Murphy, Mr Morgan, Mr Austin, Mr Rigby, and
Mr Manning supports the conclusion, which I draw, that it was common
dealers to seek the advice of members of the Jayco Corp warranty team about
claims, and when the occasion arose, they often sought
Jayco Corp’s
attitude to a request or proposal to replace an RV, or to refund the purchase
price. However, the ACCC’s
claims went further, and alleged that Jayco
Corp exercised effective control over whether a dealer would comply with its
obligation to provide a replacement RV, or a refund.
number of documents were produced relating to the question whether Jayco Corp
exercised control over the decisions of dealers to
refund the purchase price, or
to replace an RV. Mr Morgan produced an email to Jayco Corp from a dealer,
Brisbane Camperland, dated
17 February 2016. The dealer had decided
initially to replace a leaking Jayco RV, only for the consumer to experience
the replacement RV. The dealer then decided to refund the purchase
price and to take the second RV back as well. After resolving
the issue with the
consumer, the dealer then requested that Jayco Corp compensate it to the extent
of $5,000 per RV.
produced as another illustration an email exchange in February 2016 between
Jayco Corp and a dealer, Jayco Townsville, concerning
a consumer who had
experienced problems with the winding mechanism on a Jayco camper trailer, which
had to be returned to the dealer
for repairs twice. The consumer requested a
refund, and wanted to upgrade to a Jayco Expanda RV. The dealer sought a
contribution
from Jayco Corp to this transaction, and accepted an offer of
also produced an email chain from July 2016 between Jayco Corp and a
dealer, Page Bros Jayco, in relation to a Jayco camper
trailer that suffered
from a faulty riser arm. The consumers had sought to trade up from the camper
trailer to a Starcraft van. The
dealer sought a financial contribution from
Jayco Corp to the transaction. Mr Morgan told the dealer that the RV was
repairable,
and that Jayco Corp would repair it, but in addition agreed to
contribute $1,000 if the dealer itself decided to negotiate a changeover
the consumer.
cross-examination, Mr Morgan was taken to an email chain of 7 and
8 May 2014 between Jayco Corp and a dealer, Brisbane Camperland.
dealer wrote to Jayco Corp about some defects in a consumer’s RV that
included major water leaks, severe bubbling on the
internal wall, and cracking
in and around the front boot mould. The dealer stated that the consumer had
requested a replacement RV
of similar value, or his money back, and stated that
he had requested the consumer to contact Jayco Corp directly. Mr Manning
to the dealer in the following terms, to which Mr Morgan was
For this to be approved I will need a quote done up to
run past senior management here for a direction. There is not much point telling
the owner to call here. The repairs will be done under warranty as seen fit for

Please quote up.
was put to Mr Morgan that this email exchange was entirely consistent with
a process under which the question of replacement or
refund would be submitted
to Jayco Corp for approval. Mr Morgan did not agree. I pause to observe
that Mr Morgan did not recall the
email, and that its contents and any
inferences that were to be drawn from its contents were not put to
Mr Manning. In my assessment,
a fair reading of the email from
Mr Manning to the dealer is that it conveyed to the dealer that there was
not much point referring
the consumer to Jayco Corp directly, and that all Jayco
Corp would be able to tell the consumer was that repairs would be done under
warranty, and that the dealer should prepare a quotation. I do not accept that
the email demonstrates the existence of a process
under which the question of
replacement or refund would be submitted to Jayco Corp for approval.

decision as to a replacement or refund was made
by Jayco Corp. The email was not

was taken to another email, in this instance dated 5 March 2013 from
Mr Holloway of Jayco Corp to Mr Austin, to which Mr
Murphy and the relevant dealer, Watsons Caravans, were copied. The email related
to a faulty RV that the dealer had brought
to Jayco Corp’s attention in an
earlier email dated 21 February 2013. The dealer expressed the view in
the earlier email that
“we will need to be prepared to refund his money in
full”, and stated that “Jayco to refund me the dealer”,
asked, “Let me know your thoughts”. Mr Morgan was not taken to
this earlier email, but only to the last email in
the chain, where
Mr Holloway wrote to Mr Austin, copied to Mr Morgan,
Mr Murphy and the dealer –
On [the dealer’s] comments, actions, and customer
requests please have warranty express their views and recommendations.
Should this recommendation be as [the dealer] has suggested a full refund, you
will need to include Peter [Murphy, who was copied]
and myself.
Await yours and Paul’s [Murphy, who was copied]
was put to Mr Morgan that this last email in the chain was consistent with
the position that the question of refund had to be approved
by Jayco Corp.
Mr Morgan disagreed, explaining that it was concerned with what Jayco Corp
was prepared to do for the dealer, and
not what the dealer was going to do for
the customer. This answer was consistent with the earlier emails in the chain to
Morgan was not taken in cross-examination which I find were, in
substance, endeavours by the dealer to familiarise Jayco Corp with
the defects,
so that the dealer could secure financial assistance from Jayco Corp in the
event that the dealer proceeded, as it had
foreshadowed, to refund the purchase
price to the consumer.
Mr Morgan’s
answers were also consistent with another instance evidenced by an email
exchange in April 2013 where a dealer,
Jayco Sydney, refunded the purchase
price of a Jayco Expanda RV, and sought compensation from Jayco Corp after the
event. This email
exchange demonstrated that the principal of Jayco Sydney,
Mr Bilbija, had acted in that instance to refund the purchase price of
RV without first consulting Jayco Corp, and sought compensation after the
were some other emails that senior counsel for the ACCC put to Mr Morgan,
without relevant surrounding context, which I do not
consider advanced the
ACCC’s claim that dealers were required to obtain approval from Jayco Corp
before offering a refund or
replacement RV to a consumer, or otherwise
undermined the effect of Mr Morgan’s evidence.
The practices of the two Jayco dealers in relation to
decisions whether to replace an RV or to refund the purchase price
I have mentioned, the two dealer principals who were called by Jayco Corp gave
evidence about their general practices in relation
to claims for refunds or
replacement RVs made to them by consumers.
The practices of Jayco Sydney
was the dealer principal of Jayco Sydney. He gave evidence about his
understanding of Jayco Sydney’s obligations
under the ACL, and about Jayco
Sydney’s approach to responding to dissatisfied consumers who sought a
replacement RV, or a
refund from Jayco Sydney. In his affidavit, Mr Bilbija
stated that he understood that Jayco Sydney had its own obligations to its
customers under the ACL. Mr Bilbija stated that on the rare occasions when
a customer approached Jayco Sydney seeking a replacement
RV or a refund, Jayco
Sydney would seek Jayco Corp’s views on whether the RV was repairable and
whether Jayco Corp wished to
provide a replacement or refund under the Jayco
warranty. He stated that as a matter of general practice Jayco Corp usually
that Jayco Sydney would take any requests for repairs, replacements, or
refunds, at least over a certain level, to Jayco Corp. He
was consistent in his
evidence that Jayco Sydney itself always made the “final call” as to
whether a replacement or refund
would be provided. Mr Bilbija stated that
while Jayco Sydney sought input from Jayco Corp, it was Jayco Sydney that took
and had primary responsibility for determining whether it was required
under the ACL to provide a replacement or refund. Mr Bilbija
further stated
that in most cases, Jayco Sydney would make its own call to provide a
replacement RV or refund, and would then seek
financial assistance from Jayco
Corp afterwards, which was usually provided if the issue was a manufacturing
defect. Finally, Mr
Bilbija stated that on some occasions when Jayco Sydney
considered an RV to be repairable, it had nonetheless provided a replacement
refund to keep a consumer happy, and then repaired the RV and sold it
second-hand. Mr Bilbija stated that in those circumstances,
Jayco Sydney
might turn to Jayco Corp to seek reimbursement for its expenses if the issue
with the RV was a manufacturing fault.
cross-examination, Mr Bilbija maintained his evidence that he understood
that Jayco Sydney had its own obligations to its customers
under the ACL, and
that while Jayco Sydney’s approach was to seek Jayco Corp’s views on
replacement or refund requests,
Jayco Sydney itself made the final call as to
whether a replacement or refund would be provided. Mr Bilbija accepted that
Jayco Sydney’s general practice, and also Jayco Corp’s
expectation, that Jayco Sydney would seek Jayco Corp’s views
replacement or refund requests. Further, Mr Bilbija stated that Jayco
Sydney would sometimes take Jayco Corp’s directions
response to such requests. However, Mr Bilbija was consistent in
maintaining that Jayco Sydney itself considered
its own ACL obligations in
assessing and responding to such requests. In particular, Mr Bilbija stated
that Jayco Sydney did not
always seek Jayco Corp’s consent before granting
a replacement or refund. He referred generally to previous occasions where
had granted a replacement or refund without first obtaining Jayco Corp’s
consent because he considered that the RV had suffered
defect”, which he later confirmed was a reference to the “major
failure” provision of the ACL.
this respect, Mr Bilbija was taken in cross-examination to an email that he
had sent to Mr Austin of Jayco Corp on 23 May 2013
in relation to
a consumer not involved in this proceeding who sought a replacement RV or a
refund from Jayco Sydney. In that email,
Mr Bilbija referred to an earlier
instance with a consumer “[whose] van I refunded but only received an
offer of $3500 compensation
from Jayco on that one”, and went on to say,
“So with that in mind and since none of the faults are the doing of Jayco
Sydney I feel I must fight it all the way otherwise I will go broke.” It
was put to Mr Bilbija that this email demonstrated
that Jayco Sydney was
hamstrung into adopting Jayco Corp’s view on whether a replacement or a
refund should be provided, because
if Jayco Sydney provided a replacement or
refund without Jayco Corp’s agreement, then Jayco Sydney would be out of
Mr Bilbija rejected that suggestion, and stated that the email
supported his evidence that Jayco Sydney made its own decision on
replacement or
refund requests. Mr Bilbija stated that he recalled the two consumers
referred to in the email. In relation to the
earlier consumer referred to in the
email, Mr Bilbija stated that Jayco Sydney provided a refund because it
considered that it was
warranted, and that while he would have liked Jayco Corp
to contribute more as an indemnity, the fact that Jayco Sydney nonetheless
provided the refund demonstrated that Jayco Sydney made its own decisions and
that Jayco Corp’s view was not determinative.
In relation to the second
consumer that was the subject of the email, Mr Bilbija accepted that his
reference to going “broke”
was intended to encourage assistance from
Jayco Corp, but maintained that the decision was ultimately to be made by Jayco
and on the facts of that case, he did not consider that a replacement or
refund was warranted.
also gave evidence about Jayco Sydney’s consideration of the replacement
or refund requests made by
Consumer MO
Consumer JT
Consumer TB
. In keeping with his evidence about Jayco
Sydney’s general approach, Mr Bilbija stated that Jayco Sydney sought
Jayco Corp’s
views on those requests, but that it also undertook its own
assessments and made its own decisions.
relation to Jayco Sydney’s general approach to replacement or refund
requests, I accept Mr Bilbija’s evidence that
he understood that
Jayco Sydney had its own obligations to its consumers under the ACL, and that
while Jayco Sydney’s approach
was to seek Jayco Corp’s views on
replacement or refund requests, Mr Bilbija understood that Jayco Sydney
itself made the final
call as to whether a replacement or refund would be
provided. Mr Bilbija demonstrated a general awareness of Jayco
own obligations under the ACL, including an awareness, albeit
without a perfect understanding, of the operation of the “major
failure” provision of the ACL that gives rise to a consumer’s
entitlement to elect between receiving replacement goods
or a refund.
Mr Bilbija referred to this concept in cross-examination as a “major
fault”, which he later clarified to
be a reference to a major failure
under the ACL. The main point though is that Mr Bilbija demonstrated an
understanding that the
dealer’s obligations to the consumer under the ACL
were distinct from Jayco Corp’s obligations. Mr Bilbija was
cross-examined
closely about these issues, and he withstood that
cross-examination. At times, some of the questions that were put to
in cross-examination had a tendency to confuse obligations under
the Jayco warranty and obligations under the ACL, and I have taken
account in assessing Mr Bilbija’s evidence, which I found to be
credible. Further, I accept Mr Bilbija’s evidence
that there were
occasions when Jayco Sydney provided a replacement RV or a refund without first
obtaining Jayco Corp’s consent
to do so, including in the instance
referred to in his email to Mr Austin, following which Mr Bilbija was
disappointed by Jayco Corp’s
only partial contribution towards an
indemnity. However, I consider that on most occasions, and perhaps more often
following Mr Bilbija’s
disappointment with Jayco Corp’s
contributions, Jayco Sydney would seek Jayco Corp’s views as to its
willingness to contribute
before deciding whether to provide a replacement RV or
a refund. The issue remains the extent to which Jayco Sydney’s response
replacement or refund requests was influenced by Jayco Corp’s view, and
critically whether Jayco Sydney would act upon its
own view that a replacement
or refund was required to meet its own obligations under the ACL if Jayco Corp
had communicated its view
that it did not consider a replacement or refund to be
warranted. I consider that Jayco Sydney’s responses to such requests
likely influenced by Jayco Corp’s communicated position. The commercial
risk for Jayco Sydney of providing a replacement
RV or refund, which Jayco Corp
might later refuse to indemnify or fully indemnify, formed part of
Mr Bilbija’s assessment of
such requests. It is likely that
Mr Bilbija also considered the opposing commercial risk of the consumer
seeking to enforce an alleged
entitlement to reject the goods and to receive a
replacement or refund.
The practices of Jayco Newcastle
Mr Charleson
was the dealer principal of Jayco Newcastle. He gave evidence about his
understanding of Jayco Newcastle’s obligations
under the ACL and about
Jayco Newcastle’s approach to responding to consumers who sought a
replacement RV or a refund from
Jayco Newcastle. Mr Charleson’s
evidence on this issue was relatively brief, compared to Mr Bilbija’s
evidence on the
corresponding topic.
his affidavit, Mr Charleson stated that he understood that Jayco Newcastle
had its own obligations under the ACL. Mr Charleson
stated that he made his
own decisions about how Jayco Newcastle would assist customers with complaints
Mr Charleson stated that he considered that
it was for Jayco Newcastle, as the selling dealer, to take the lead as it had
responsibility for providing replacement RVs or refunds to consumers
where an RV had a major problem or it had a history of not having
been properly
repaired. Mr Charleson stated that if a consumer requested a replacement or
a refund, or if it appeared to Jayco Newcastle
that the problem was so
significant as to warrant considering providing a replacement, Jayco Newcastle
might discuss the matter with
Jayco Corp, or it might choose to proceed without
involving Jayco Corp. Mr Charleson stated that if Jayco Newcastle provided
to Jayco Corp to show that the fault probably resulted from
manufacturing, and if the fault was not repairable, or the cost of repair
large compared to the overall price, then Jayco Corp would generally agree to
pay for the cost of replacement parts, or to pay
for or contribute towards the
cost of a replacement RV. Mr Charleson stated that while he considered
Jayco Newcastle’s own
obligations under the ACL, where a customer’s
complaint concerned a manufacturing fault falling under the Jayco warranty,
Corp’s response was generally sufficient. Mr Charleson also
referred generally to occasions in which he had agreed to replace
customer’s RV, even when he considered that Jayco Newcastle was not
obliged to do so, because he wanted to improve the relationship
between that
customer and Jayco Newcastle. Mr Charleson stated that on those occasions,
either Jayco Newcastle bore the entire cost,
or sometimes Jayco Corp provided
financial assistance.
Mr Charleson
was challenged on this evidence. During cross-examination, Mr Charleson
stated that whenever an issue arose with an RV
which Jayco Newcastle considered
to be a manufacturing fault, Jayco Newcastle would raise it with Jayco Corp, and
that he considered
that it was appropriate that Jayco Corp bear the cost of
fixing the issue. Mr Charleson stated that Jayco Corp would provide
as to whether in its opinion the issue was a manufacturing fault, and
what Jayco Corp was willing to do about it, which he would
communicate to the
customer. As to Jayco Newcastle’s own obligations under the ACL,
Mr Charleson stated that Jayco Corp’s
response did not absolve Jayco
Newcastle of its obligations to consumers under the ACL, although it was usually
sufficient. During
cross-examination, Mr Charleson was taken to part of
Jayco Newcastle’s response to a statutory notice to produce issued to
by the ACCC, which stated that “Jayco Newcastle does not have a process by
which major failures are assessed. Jayco Newcastle
has never had an instance of
a major failure.” It was put to Mr Charleson that part of the reason
for that response was that
ordinarily the matter the subject of the
customer’s complaint would be dealt with by Jayco Corp under the Jayco
warranty process.
Mr Charleson responded, “[a]nd Jayco
Newcastle”, and accepted that by this answer he meant that that Jayco
would first assess the issue and then submit the report to Jayco
as a whole, I accept Mr Charleson’s evidence that he understood that
Jayco Newcastle had its own obligations to its customers
under the ACL, and that
he considered that Jayco Newcastle should take the lead as it was primarily
responsible to provide a replacement
RV or a refund if a customer’s RV had
a major problem, which I take to be a reference to the major failure provision
of the ACL. I do not consider that Jayco Newcastle’s
response to the ACCC notice to produce, in which it stated that it did
a process for assessing major failures, or the cross-examination of
Mr Charleson on that topic, significantly undermined
that evidence when
viewed in the context of the totality of Mr Charleson’s
The ACCC’s claims in relation to Jayco Corp’s
I stated at the outset at [
the ACCC did not allege that Jayco Corp engaged in a system of conduct or a
pattern of behaviour such as to engage s 21(4)(b) of
the ACL. However, the
allegations made by the ACCC about the conduct of Jayco Corp were set against
the background of circumstances
of a general nature, and what were alleged to be
the practices of Jayco Corp in dealing with consumer complaints as part of the
warranty process. Before considering the ACCC’s claim that Jayco
Corp unfairly obstructed the four individual Consumers from
obtaining a refund
or a replacement RV, it is convenient to express some conclusions in relation to
some of the general circumstances
that were alleged.
ACCC alleged that an ordinary consumer seeking a remedy for a defective RV was
unlikely to understand the distinction between
the consumer guarantees under the
ACL and the Jayco warranty. In submissions, the ACCC claimed that consumers were
liable to be confused
Jayco Corp. Those allegations invite some degree of speculation, and were
established by the evidence. The text of the Jayco warranty drew attention to
the separate rights of consumers under the ACL
in terms that complied with
reg 90 of the
Competition and Consumer Regulations
, and on that
ground I have at [
] rejected the ACCC’s submission
that there were deficiencies in the warranty document in relation to its
references to the
ACL. Three of the four Consumers approached New South Wales
Fair Trading for assistance, which evidences a consciousness in a general
of consumer rights. To the extent that there was the possibility of confusion
concerning rights under a manufacturer’s
warranty, and rights under the
ACL, that is a product of the matrix of statutory obligations that exist under
the ACL, and any inadequacies
in the prescribed information in the warranty
document are hardly to be attributed to Jayco Corp. It is difficult to form an
value judgment about the conduct of a manufacturer in offering an
unremarkable manufacturer’s warranty, with some potential
benefits to
consumers, when the existence and enforcement of such warranties are expressly
accommodated by the legislation, and when
its terms do not contravene, but
comply with the regulatory prescriptions. That said, I accept that there is in a
general sense potential
for some confusion about the position, just as there may
be a likelihood of confusion about the rights of consumers generally under
relation to the separate identities of Jayco Corp and the dealers, the Jayco
warranty drew to the Consumers’ attention the
distinction between the
Jayco Corp corporate entity and any Jayco dealer. The warranty referred to
“Jayco Corporation Pty Ltd
(ABN 005 266 991)”, and separately
referred to “a Jayco dealer”. However,
Consumer TB
not read the Jayco warranty prior to giving evidence. There was an attempt by
the ACCC to support this confusion through the
evidence of
Consumer TB,
who stated in his affidavit that he assumed that the dealerships were
branches of Jayco and that they represented Jayco Corp
cross-examination,
Consumer TB
stated that it was not his belief
that Jayco Corp was a separate organisation from Jayco Sydney and Jayco
Canberra. He stated that
he thought that Mr Manning was a regional manager.
Although I do not attribute a perfect state of understanding to
Consumer TB,
I do not accept that he was entirely confused about the
roles of Jayco Corp, Jayco Sydney, and Jayco Canberra. In his affidavit,
Consumer TB
described how prior to purchase he shopped around. He
stated that he went to different Jayco “agents” to obtain
quotations.
Further, he was in possession of an invoice from Jayco Sydney that
identified the corporate entity that sold the RV to him. His email
Mr Gregorovic of Jayco Sydney dated 28 May 2013 (see [
] above) demonstrates that he
understood that he had purchased the RV from Jayco Sydney, and not Jayco
Canberra, or Jayco Corp, and
he acknowledged to Jayco Sydney that it did not
build the RV. Finally,
Consumer TB
’s email to Jayco Canberra
of 5 February 2014 (see [
] above) demonstrates that he
understood that Jayco Canberra was not the supplier of the RV, but was a
“repair, service and
warranty agent”.
central element of the ACCC’s case, which was alleged in paragraph [5] of
its concise statement, and which was appropriately
the subject of much
cross-examination, was the allegation that Jayco Corp had express control over
the replacement or repair of an
RV under the Jayco warranty, and effective
control over whether the dealer complied with its statutory obligations to
provide a refund
or replacement. That allegation was not established by the
evidence. The picture that was presented by the evidence was that the
interlinked obligations of the dealer to the consumer under the ACL, of Jayco
Corp to indemnify the dealer under the ACL, and of
Jayco Corp to the consumer
under the Jayco warranty which was enforceable as a statutory guarantee under
the ACL, had the unremarkable
consequence that the dealers consulted Jayco Corp
or a replacement RV. It is also unremarkable in an ongoing commercial
relationship that, as Mr Bilbija accepted, Jayco Corp expected
the dealers
to consult with it about such issues. Those issues included technical issues,
the approval of warranty claims for repairs,
and Jayco Corp’s attitude to
claims for replacement RVs, or refunds. In the case of Jayco Sydney, that
consultation also had
a human element, because its service manager
Mr Holman, who had worked at the Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong for a
number of years,
looked to his former colleagues for guidance.
am satisfied that as a matter of practice, the views of Jayco Corp were liable
to influence the decisions of dealers, who looked
to Jayco Corp for guidance,
and had their own commercial interests to balance against their potential legal
liability to consumers.
It was a natural result of the warranty claims process
that the decisions of Jayco Corp would play a part in shaping the dealers’
responses to consumer claims. However, the evidence of Mr Morgan, the
objective support for that evidence found in the email communications
have referred, and the evidence of the dealer principals Mr Bilbija and
Mr Charleson, leads me to reject the ACCC’s
case to the extent that
it involved alleging a practice under which Jayco Corp exercised control over,
as distinct from having influence
in connection with, the dealers’
compliance with their obligations under the ACL. Specifically, I reject the
notion that Jayco
Corp had a requirement that its dealers obtain its approval
before agreeing to a refund or a replacement RV.
follows that I also reject another component of the ACCC’s claim, namely
that Jayco Corp contravened
of the ACL by failing to exercise a choice
to provide a replacement RV under the terms of the Jayco warranty in
circumstances where
there was a corresponding right of a consumer under the ACL
to reject the goods, and to seek a refund or replacement RV from the
As I have remarked earlier, there is a matrix of statutory rights and
obligations under which in the event of a major failure
to comply with a
relevant statutory guarantee, upon rejecting the goods, a consumer is able to
elect whether to require the supplier
to refund the purchase price, or to
replace goods. The ACCC’s claim in [8] of its concise statement relevantly
extended only
to an allegation that Jayco Corp refused to exercise its
discretion under the Jayco warranty to provide a replacement RV in circumstances
where Jayco Corp had no corresponding direct obligation to the Consumer under
the ACL to supply a replacement RV. The ACCC did not
rely on any suggested
failure of Jayco Corp to refund the purchase price of the RVs to support its
claim. Jayco Corp did not supply
the RVs to the consumers, and there was
therefore no purchase price for it to repay.
is apparent, there was an asymmetry between the obligations of the dealers as
suppliers, and of Jayco Corp as the manufacturer.
As Mr Bilbija stated in
cross-examination in the context of the ACL, “the warranty essentially
lies with me because I’m
the selling dealer, and then if I want to
claim reimbursement, I would then have to go to Jayco to claim that
reimbursement”.
The evidence to which I have referred of refunds and
replacement RVs that were supplied by dealers to consumers in other instances
illustrates that there is no necessary correspondence between the liability of a
dealer to a consumer, and the liability of Jayco
Corp to the dealer. As some of
those instances illustrate, the decision of a dealer to accept the rejection of
an RV by a consumer
may result in the dealer effecting repairs and re-selling
the RV to another consumer. The dealer may also negotiate the sale of a
different model RV to the first consumer. The evidence supports an inference
that working out the liability of Jayco Corp to a dealer
in these circumstances
was likely to be the subject of commercial negotiation between a dealer
principal, and staff at Jayco Corp
with the requisite seniority.
The ACCC’s claims of unconscionable conduct by Jayco
Corp in relation to the four Consumers
the above background relating to the general practices of Jayco Corp and the two
relevant dealers in relation to the assessment
of claims for refunds or
replacement RVs, it is necessary to turn to the circumstances relating to the
four Consumers. Those claims
fall to be examined particularly through the lens
of what information Jayco Corp had in relation to the claims, and Jayco
responses to them, against the background circumstances.
Consumer RH
the reasons that I have given, I am not persuaded that there was a major failure
to comply with a statutory guarantee which entitled
Consumer RH
reject her RV, and to seek a refund or replacement RV. A necessary premise of
the ACCC’s claim in relation to the allegation
that Jayco Corp acted
unconscionably in the case of
Consumer RH
is therefore absent, and
its claim that Jayco Corp engaged in unconscionable conduct in the case of
Consumer RH
fails. Putting that to one side, other factual findings
can be made in relation to
Consumer RH
’s circumstances.
am not persuaded that
Consumer RH
requested a refund from Jayco
Newcastle during telephone conversations on 5 December 2014 as she
claimed (see [
]). Even if she
had, there is no evidence that any such request came to the attention of Jayco
Corp, and her claimed request would
therefore not be materially relevant to the
conduct of Jayco Corp.
Consumer RH
made written requests to
Mr Manning of Jayco Corp for a refund or replacement RV on
4 May 2015 (see [
5 May 2015 (see [
and 10 May 2015 (see [
]). She also made a written request on
11 May 2015 to Mr Charleson of Jayco Newcastle to entertain a
proposal to supply her with another
RV of equal value (see [
]), and made a similar request to
Mr Butcher in a telephone conversation on 12 May 2015
]). Those requests
culminated in Mr Butcher’s email to
Consumer RH
12 May 2015 in which he stated that the RV was repairable, and would
be repaired, and in which he requested that
Consumer RH
bring her RV
in for assessment, and otherwise offered to give
Consumer RH
changeover price for her RV (see [
Mr Manning’s viewpoint, at the time that he received
Consumer RH
’s first request for a refund on
4 May 2015, he had authorised warranty repairs for pre-delivery works
on 4 December 2014 to
the value of $74.25, and post-delivery on
26 February 2015 and 30 March 2015 to the value of $80.85
and $346.78 respectively, which
included items arising from the roof
misalignment that caused a strut to damage the tent. On 4 May 2015,
Mr Manning arranged for
a repairman to attend
Consumer RH
’s RV on-site at Crows Nest in Queensland, and he
later organised for Mr Wells to effect repairs at Agnes Water on
7 May 2015.
Consumer RH
’s email request for a refund or
replacement of 4 May 2015, Mr Manning sent his response on
5 May 2015, directing her to contact
Jayco Newcastle, but also
containing a statement about the terms of the warranty being limited to repair
of the RV. I have found
that Mr Manning’s email of
5 May 2015 contravened
(1)(m) of the ACL because it
misrepresented the nature of
Consumer RH
Mr Manning’s email to
Consumer RH
of 6 May 2015
was to similar effect. What happened thereafter was that in email correspondence
Consumer RH
sought authorisation for a replacement roof and skirt,
to which Mr Manning responded by stating that an assessment had to be
first, and that he then needed to ask management (see [
] above). Notwithstanding this
communication to
Consumer RH
, Mr Manning was then faced with
information from Jayco Newcastle that
Consumer RH
had claimed that
he had authorised a replacement roof and skirt. I have set out the relevant
email exchanges recording
Consumer RH’s
claims at [
] above. Mr Manning’s
response of 11 May 2015, which I have set out at [
] above, was to direct
Consumer RH
to the selling dealer in relation to the request in her
email of 10 May 2015 for a refund or a replacement RV.
upon a hypothesis that there was a major failure that entitled
Consumer RH
to reject her RV, the totality of the circumstances do
not support the ACCC’s claim that Jayco Corp engaged in conduct that
unconscionable. I find that both Jayco Newcastle and Jayco Corp shared the view
that the faults with the RV did not warrant a
replacement or refund. The
relevant person at Jayco Corp, namely Mr Manning, had the view that the
fault with the roof was minor,
was easily repairable, and was probably the
product of user error. Those views were not shown to have been unreasonably
Mr Manning, or to have been formed in bad faith. The warranty
work that had been undertaken in February and March 2015 did not inevitably
point to a major failure, and whether the problems that
Consumer RH
experienced while away in May 2015 were the result of a major failure could
not be reliably assessed without inspecting the RV.
Jayco Corp did not
act unreasonably when it responded to
Consumer RH
’s claims by
requesting her to take her RV to the selling dealer. This was because it was
reasonable to have the RV assessed
in a workshop before considering a response,
and because the dealer, and not Jayco Corp, was liable to refund the purchase
or replace the RV in the event that there was a major failure. This was in
accordance with Jayco Corp’s usual practice to refer
consumers to the
selling dealer, and there was nothing remarkable about this practice. On the
contrary, it accorded with common sense
and good business practice to have
consumer claims assessed by the dealer. Further, the request to have the RV
assessed in a workshop
was reasonably made having regard to some of
Consumer RH
’s claims as to what Mr Manning had advised
her in relation to authorising a replacement roof, which claims I have found
the product of confusion on her part, and not based in fact.
Consumer RH
did not take her RV back to Jayco Newcastle for
assessment, but after lodging her complaint with New South Wales Fair Trading,
after attending a conciliation conference, she decided to trade it in for a
different model.
ACCC’s claim of unconscionable conduct by Jayco Corp in relation to
Consumer RH
must be rejected, including upon a hypothesis that there
had been a major failure to comply with a statutory guarantee.
Consumer MO
first communication that Jayco Corp received from
Consumer MO
the email of 2 February 2014 which expressed disappointment with the
RV, stating “not everything about it, just some aspects
that need to be
addressed”. There was no request in that email for a refund or a
replacement RV. On 5 February 2014, Jayco
Corp responded by requesting
that the RV be taken to Jayco Sydney for the concerns to be addressed, and
copying that response to
Mr Gregorovic of Jayco Sydney. These email
communications are set out at [
Thereafter,
on about 14 March 2014,
Consumer MO
took his RV to Jayco
Sydney for assessment following which there was a series of email exchanges
between Mr Gregorovic of Jayco Sydney
and Mr Manning of Jayco Corp
which resulted in Mr Gregorovic’s quotation by email dated
21 March 2014 (see [
] above). The requests made by
Mr Manning in his emails were consistent with an obvious need to obtain
more precise information about
the problems with the RV, and the cost of any
works that would be necessary to repair it. The requests were reasonable, and
unremarkable.
24 March 2014, Mr Manning requested Mr Gregorovic to obtain
a quotation from an independent repairer, RVGO. Mr Gregorovic had earlier
suggested RVGO as a potential repairer in his email of 18 March 2014
Consumer MO
then took his RV to RVGO, who reported to Mr Manning on
8 April 2014 (see [
above) that: (1) the repairer felt that all the issues could be resolved
without sending the RV back to the factory; (2) the repairer
had informed
Consumer MO
that his RV had minor problems, but nothing that could
not be fixed; and (3) that the consumer was happy, and that he had sent him
away to enjoy the vehicle over the Easter break and that he would be in contact
with him after ANZAC day. On this basis, on 14 April
2014, which was
the Monday prior to Easter, Mr Manning authorised the repairs for which
RVGO had quoted (see [
next relevant events are that following the second collapse of the roof after
his Easter holiday,
Consumer MO
spoke to Mr Bilbija by
telephone and at the caravan show at the Rosehill racecourse, and requested a
refund or a new RV, the result
of which was that on 8 May 2014 Jayco
Sydney arranged for
Consumer MO
’s RV to be collected from his
the RV was inspected by Mr Holman, he emailed Mr Manning on
8 May 2014 seeking his advice, as a result of which Mr Manning
by stating that “Jayco will not be giving owner a new camper or
refund”. This was elevated by Mr Holman to Mr Bilbija,
dealer principal of Jayco Sydney, who then requested a discussion with
Mr Austin of Jayco Corp. Email exchanges ensued, in which
identified differences between the quotations given by Jayco Sydney and RVGO,
and stated that he could not refer the request
for a new RV to Mr Murphy on
the information to hand, and that a replacement RV would only be agreed for
major structural or safety
reasons. By his email dated 13 May 2014,
Mr Austin advised Mr Bilbija that the RV should go to RVGO for
repairs. These email exchanges
are set out at [
around this time,
Consumer MO
had a telephone conversation with
Mr Manning about his concerns with his RV, in which Mr Manning told
him that he would have to speak
to Jayco Sydney about any issues that he was
having with his RV, as I have recounted at [
stated that when
Consumer MO
pointed out his issues with the RV at
the caravan show at the Rosehill racecourse, they appeared to be quite minor,
explaining that
they had no bearing on the structural integrity of the RV.
Mr Bilbija also stated that after Mr Holman had looked over the RV, he
told Mr Bilbija that there was nothing seriously wrong with the RV, and
nothing that could not be rectified through repair. Mr Bilbija
stated that
this was consistent with his initial assessment that the issues were relatively
minor and cosmetic, and would not require
a refund or a replacement RV. This
included the riser arm issue, which Mr Bilbija stated was an easy issue to
fix, and was not a
major issue. Mr Bilbija stated that he agreed with
Mr Austin’s views that the issues with the RV were repairable and not
defects, and did not warrant a replacement RV, which in cross-examination
he clarified to be a reference to his email to Mr Austin
14 May 2014 in which he stated to Mr Austin, “I understand
your position” (see [
above). He stated again in cross-examination that he did not believe at the time
that a rebuild or a replacement RV was warranted.
He was not challenged about
these views. In particular, it was not put to Mr Bilbija that these views
were unreasonable or not honestly
was cross-examined about his decision to authorise Mr Bilbija on
13 May 2014 to have RVGO undertake the repairs. The tenor
cross-examination was that the reason for his decision was that the RVGO
assessment was less expensive, with which Mr Austin
substantially agreed.
However that was in the context where Mr Austin also stated that he knew
that RVGO was a very good repairer
of caravans, and that he wanted to get things
done in the most efficient way. I do not consider that this cross-examination
anywhere. In particular, Mr Austin was not confronted with any
suggestion that his opinions about the nature of the issues with the
that they could be efficiently repaired by RVGO, were not honestly held, or were
not formed in good faith.
I have explained above, ultimately Jayco Sydney performed the repair works on
Consumer MO
’s RV itself. Jayco Sydney submitted to Jayco Corp
a warranty claim for those repair works on 12 August 2014. That claim
later approved by Jayco Corp, on Mr Austin’s instructions. After
the repairs were completed, on 17 August 2014 Jayco Corp received
Consumer MO
setting out the eight sundry items that
remained, and requesting a full refund of the purchase price, to which I
referred at [
Mr Manning’s response, sent on 18 August 2014 (see [
] above), which was copied to
Mr Holman, was to request Mr Holman to book the RV in to have the
remaining items addressed under warranty,
stating that he did not see the
matters as requiring a refund. From the perspective of the information available
to Jayco Corp, those
repairs were completed under warranty at the modest cost of
No Jayco Corp witness was challenged about the notation in the
warranty claim that nothing could be done about the roof alignment,

Mr Holman’s evidence that the alignment was within normal tolerances
went unchallenged.
am not persuaded that Jayco Corp’s conduct in relation to
Consumer MO
was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable. The
starting point is my rejection of the premises of the ACCC’s claims that
Jayco Corp controlled the dealers’ decisions in relation to their
obligations under the ACL, and that it imposed a requirement
on dealers that
they had to seek the approval of Jayco Corp before agreeing to a replacement RV
or a refund.
Jayco Corp’s perspective, it was presented with differing information in
April 2014 about the nature of the issues with
Consumer MO
’s RV. It chose to accept a quotation for repairs
undertaken by RVGO, which Mr Austin regarded as a very good repairer, that
portrayed the issues as being cosmetic and readily repairable, and which
informed Jayco Corp that at that time, the consumer was
happy. Mr Manning
stated in his affidavit that upon receiving the RVGO quotation, he proceeded on
the basis that
Consumer MO
’s RV had only minor problems that
were easily repaired. In cross-examination, Mr Manning accepted that the
quoted works amounted
to a fairly significant repair, stating that
“it’s a lot of hours”. Mr Austin stated that he thought
of the concerns were cosmetic items that were only visible from
underneath the RV, and that the remaining items were not difficult
While I have taken the view on the totality of the evidence presented to the
Court that there was a major failure to comply
with the statutory guarantee of
acceptable quality, this involved careful consideration of a number of questions
of fact and degree
by the Court, including whether the reasonable consumer fully
acquainted with the nature of the failure to comply with the guarantee
acceptable quality would not have acquired the RV. The case of
Consumer MO
was not so clear-cut that the only conscionable view of
the matter at the relevant time was that there had been a major failure to
comply with a statutory guarantee that entitled
Consumer MO
reject the goods, and to seek a refund or replacement.
were two material events that occurred subsequent to Jayco Corp’s
acceptance of the RVGO quotation dated 8 April 2014.
The first was the
collapse of the roof of the RV following
Consumer MO
trip. The second was
Consumer MO
’s attendance at the caravan
show at the Rosehill racecourse where he confronted Mr Bilbija.
relation to the roof collapse, Jayco Corp was reasonably entitled to entertain
doubts as to its cause, and to think that it might
have been caused by incorrect
use rather than a manufacturing defect, which was a view expressed by
Mr Austin in comments that he
made in an email dated 8 May 2014
] above), and was a view
expressed in evidence by Mr Holman, and Mr Manning. The fact that this
question was not explored in the cross-examination
Consumer MO
one of the factors that has led me to conclude that the failure of the riser arm
was not caused by user error, but that does not
gainsay a finding that at the
relevant time Mr Austin reasonably, and at least not unconscionably,
entertained the view that user
error was a possibility.
Mr Bilbija met and spoke with
Consumer MO
at the Rosehill
racecourse,
he became directly involved in the communications with Jayco
Corp in relation to the management of
Consumer MO
Jayco Sydney, and not Jayco Corp, was liable to
Consumer MO
refund the purchase price or to replace the RV in the event of a major failure.
Under the legislative scheme, Jayco Corp did not
liability as if it were the supplier. While I am not satisfied that
Mr Bilbija had a perfect understanding of the operation of the
ACL, he did
have a sufficient understanding that if a failure was serious, the dealer was
liable to the consumer to refund or replace
the RV, and that Jayco Corp had a
liability to indemnify the dealer. This broadly reflected the statutory and
commercial framework
in which his dealership and Jayco Corp operated.
Mr Bilbija made the effective decision to proceed with the repair work
rather than
replace the RV, or refund the purchase price. No doubt he did so
after receiving and taking account of Jayco Corp’s views,
as expressed by
relation to the list of sundry items that
Consumer MO
identified in
his email of 17 August 2014, the ACCC has not demonstrated that there
was anything unreasonable or unconscionable in
treating these as minor residual
items that were capable of easy repair. In this respect, there were aspects of
the written submissions
of the ACCC in relation to
Consumer MO
over-reached, including a submission that “Jayco Corp knew that despite
many repair attempts, the defects in MO’s
RV had not been fixed”,
when in fact there had been one principal set of repairs.
back and looking at the accumulation of detail, the ACCC has not demonstrated
that the processes in which Jayco Corp engaged
in evaluating the claim against
its warranty obligations, and its decision to authorise and recommend repairs,
and to determine not
to replace the RV, were not undertaken in good faith. As I
have mentioned already, senior counsel for the ACCC did not allege in
submissions that there was any conscious bad faith by Jayco Corp, and I have
taken that into account. Nor in my opinion did
the course of conduct by Jayco
Corp in this instance reveal an objective absence of good faith. In relation to
the principal set
of repairs, Mr Bilbija was involved directly in the
decision to repair, and while I find that his decision was informed by Jayco
Corp’s attitude that it would not agree to a replacement RV, Jayco Corp
did not exercise actual control over his decision,
or act unconscionably to
Consumer MO
Consumer JT
Jayco Corp’s perspective, the first relevant communication with
Consumer JT
occurred on 22 December 2015 when
Mr Manning called him to discuss his concerns with his RV after receiving a
copy of his responses
to the online survey. I referred to that conversation
] above. At that time,
Consumer JT
’s RV had been repaired in September 2015, and
he complained of “ongoing problems” and sought either a refund or
new RV. Mr Manning responded to the effect “no, we will fix
it”, and reported the conversation to Jayco Sydney. I do
not consider that
on the information then available to Mr Manning that this was an occasion
on which Jayco Corp was obliged seriously
to consider any claim that it had to
replace the RV.
next communication occurred in January 2016, when
Consumer JT
spoke to Mr Rigby of Jayco Corp after he had experienced leaking in the
RV following heavy rainfall while he was at Ulladulla. In
the first of those
conversations, Mr Rigby offered to reimburse the cost of air mattresses
20 January 2016, Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney forwarded to
Mr Manning of Jayco Corp
Consumer JT
’s email of the
previous day to which I referred at [
] above, in which he set out his
grievances, and foreshadowed that he would be returning his RV, and sought a new
RV or a return of
the purchase price. Mr Holman asked Mr Manning,
“Please advise on replacement”. Mr Manning’s response,
have set out at [
above, was to request a full assessment and quotation so that he could run it
past Mr Morgan for review. Mr Holman then forwarded
to Mr Manning
some photographs that
Consumer JT
had sent him. Mr Manning
responded by stating that he had let Mr Morgan know that Mr Holman
would send a report and a quotation,
as the owner wanted a new van (see [
] above). As I stated at [
] above, the evidence does not
disclose that Jayco Sydney submitted any assessment and quotation for the
purpose of Mr Manning considering
a replacement RV.
22 January 2016, Mr Holman forwarded
Consumer JT
’s email of the previous day in which he stated
that he would “not accept any more fixes on this product” separately
to Mr Rigby of Jayco Corp, and to Mr Bilbija of Jayco Sydney.
Mr Rigby responded by requesting that Mr Holman send through a report
of his findings once he had inspected the RV, and suggested that it seemed that
the tent sections had not been seasoned correctly
] above). I infer that by about
22 January 2016, Jayco Corp had identified the problem with the
leaking bed lids in the 2015 Jayco
Expanda models, and sought to develop a
fix. This inference arises from Mr Holman’s email to
Consumer JT
to which I referred at [
]. Later, on
27 January 2016, Mr Manning sent an email to Jayco Sydney
that referred to the fix, suggesting that it would be released soon
] above), and in an
Consumer JT
dated 1 February 2016 Mr Holman
referred to Jayco Corp working on a solution (see [
27 January 2016, Jayco Sydney sought authorisation from Jayco Corp to
order replacement parts for the leaking tent sections, which
approved (see [
] above). I infer from
Mr Holman’s email to Mr Rigby and Mr Body of Jayco Corp
dated 28 January 2016, to which I referred at
] above, that Mr Holman was
proceeding on the basis that the
Consumer JT
’s RV would be
repaired, because he sought that his order for parts be processed urgently.
28 January 2016, Mr Holman brought the issue relating to the
leaking Expanda bed ends to the attention of Mr Bilbija, the dealer
principal of Jayco Sydney.
Mr Holman’s
Consumer JT
dated 1 February 2016, to which
I referred at [
stated that he had submitted a report to “Head Office”, and that
they had denied a request for a new van. This
statement is puzzling, because it
does not appear from the evidence that Mr Holman responded to
Mr Rigby’s request of 22 January
2016 to send a report
containing his findings, which would be the type of material that would be
elevated to Mr Morgan for his consideration,
as Mr Holman had been
told. As I have noted at [
] above, in cross-examination
Mr Holman was not asked to identify from whom he had received that
instruction, and there is no written
record of such an instruction in evidence
in circumstances where there is a considerable body of email communications
between Jayco
Sydney and Jayco Corp about the management of all claims. Adding
to the perplexity is that Mr Rigby’s email of
1 February 2016,
which attached the service bulletin in relation to
the repair to the bed lids was sent at 8.07 am, and Mr Bilbija sent it to
at 11.45 am, who then forwarded it to other staff at 11.53
am. Mr Holman’s email to
Consumer JT
1 February 2016 was sent at 10:08am. Mr Manning stated in
cross-examination that he could not recall whether he was involved in
decision referred to in the email.
appears to me that Jayco Sydney proceeded to order replacement parts, pressing
the urgency of the same by Mr Holman’s email
dated 28 January
2016, because it had been threatened with Fair Trading claims from some
consumers, which in the case of
Consumer JT
was actually lodged on
or about 1 February 2016. Mr Holman had also proceeded on
27 January 2016 to obtain a quotation from a contractor
for the repair
of the fibreglass chip on the bed lid. Those orders for parts and the request
for a quotation were made in the week
before Mr Holman’s email to
Consumer JT
of 1 February 2016.
Jayco Corp was forwarded emails by Mr Holman that identified that
Consumer JT
claimed an entitlement to a new RV, I am not persuaded
that Jayco Sydney made any express or formal request to Jayco Corp that it
or otherwise supply a new RV for him, or reach some commercial arrangement with
Jayco Sydney in relation to refunding the purchase
price. I find that from Jayco
Corp’s viewpoint, such a request, if serious, would usually have come from
Mr Bilbija, accompanied
by supporting documents and arguments. Rather,
Jayco Sydney proceeded to order parts, and sought a quotation from a contractor
repairs, as evidenced by the emails of 23 and
27 January 2016, to which I referred at [
] above. This activity, and the
absence of any response to Mr Rigby’s request for an assessment is
not consistent with Jayco
Sydney contemplating in any considered way that it
might supply
Consumer JT
with a replacement RV, or repay the
purchase price. This is confirmed by Mr Bilbija’s affidavit evidence
in which he referred
to the fact that on 2 February 2016 he had been
forwarded relevant email correspondence by Mr Holman, and in which he
stated that
he considered that
Consumer JT
’s issues only
needed minor repairs and did not require a refund or replacement RV. These
aspects of Jayco Sydney’s conduct,
as they would have appeared to Jayco
Corp against the background that Jayco Sydney had the direct liability to the
consumer to refund
the purchase price or to replace the RV, are material to
evaluating the ACCC’s claims that Jayco Corp’s conduct was
unconscionable.
while I am puzzled as a result of the state of the evidence about the decision
of “Head Office” recorded in Mr Holman’s
1 November 2016 to
Consumer JT
to deny a request for a new
RV, on the assumption that such a decision was made by Jayco Corp, it was not by
reference to any seriously
considered request by Jayco Sydney for a replacement
RV, or to negotiate some commercial arrangement in relation to a refund of the
purchase price to the consumer. I find that Jayco Sydney had not formed any
intention of entertaining those options.
relation to
Consumer JT
’s telephone conference call with two
persons from Jayco Corp to which I referred at [
] above, I am not able to make a
finding as to precisely when this conversation occurred, save that it is more
likely than not that
it occurred after Mr Holman’s email to
Consumer JT
of 1 February 2016 to which I referred
] above, and it may have
occurred after
Consumer JT
’s meeting with Mr Holman to
which I referred at [
] above. On the basis of
this finding, it occurred after Jayco Corp had developed the fix for the bed lid
leak and had issued the
service bulletin which estimated that it would take 45
minutes per bed to repair using some basic tools.
12 February 2016,
Consumer JT
had decided to allow Jayco
Sydney to effect the repairs to his RV, which then took some time.
am not persuaded that the conduct of Jayco Corp in relation to
Consumer JT
is to be characterised as unconscionable. My main
reasons are,
, my finding that as a matter of practice Jayco Corp
did not require its dealers to obtain its approval before agreeing to a
request to replace an RV, or to provide a refund. There was a
mutual expectation of consultation, but this is consistent with normal
acceptable business behaviour and practice.
Jayco Sydney did not ever make any considered, supported request to Jayco Corp
for a replacement RV, or for assistance in refunding
the purchase price. As I
have found, from the early stages Jayco Sydney proceeded on the basis that it
was going to repair the RV,
and the evidence does not suggest that Jayco Sydney
ever seriously entertained replacing the RV or refunding the purchase price.
it done so, I expect that it would have given consideration to taking the RV
back, repairing it under the Jayco warranty, and
then re-selling it. There is no
suggestion this was ever in Jayco Sydney’s contemplation.
the conduct of Jayco Corp, as with the other consumers, is to be evaluated on
the basis that it had no direct liability to the consumer
to replace the RV, or
to refund the purchase price, but its direct liability was under its
manufacturer’s warranty. A liability
to refund or replace attached to the
supplier under the ACL, Jayco Sydney, as its dealer principal Mr Bilbija
understood. Jayco Corp
was not in a
way liable to the consumer
as if it was the supplier.
the conduct of Jayco Corp is to be evaluated having regard to the
circumstances that existed at the time, including that defects with
a number of
bed lids became apparent to it after the heavy rains of early January 2016
when there were reduced staff in attendance
at the Jayco Corp factory, and in
circumstances where the research and development team did not return until later
in January 2016.
Jayco Corp then moved relatively quickly to investigate
the problem and to develop a remedy. The initial responses of Mr Manning
and Mr Rigby have to be assessed in that context. The initial response of
Mr Rigby when
Consumer JT
called him in early January 2016
had been to offer to refund the cost of replacement mattresses, and the
responses to Jayco Sydney
included requests to have the RV assessed and to
provide a report so that the matter could be escalated to Mr Morgan for
There was nothing objectively unacceptable about these responses.
I find that no report was submitted in support of a request for
consideration of a refund or replacement RV because Jayco Sydney did not
consider that the relevant failures merited a refund or
replacement. Instead,
Jayco Sydney elected to order replacement parts, and to request a quotation for
a contracted fibreglass repair.
I do not consider that Jayco Corp acted unreasonably, still less unconscionably,
in thinking that it would be able to develop a remedy
for the bed lid leaks, and
then issuing the service bulletin outlining the repairs that were required. It
is notorious that from
time to time manufacturers of complex goods, such as
motor vehicles, will issue service bulletins to rectify defects in goods that
have been discovered as time goes on. Depending upon the circumstances, the
reasonable consumer will tolerate some such instances
of recalls or warranty
work at the instigation of the manufacturer, and I consider this feature of the
marketplace to be relevant
to determining whether the conduct of Jayco Corp is
to be characterised as unconscionable.
Consumer JT
’s RV had a number of issues that were in addition
to the major leaking that had been caused by the design defect with the bed
lids. It is the accumulation of all the issues that has led me to find that the
reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the nature
and extent of the failure
to comply with the statutory guarantee of acceptable quality would not have
acquired the RV. Because at
the relevant times in January 2016 Jayco Sydney
did not undertake and submit to Jayco Corp a full appraisal of all the problems
request a replacement RV, but submitted orders for parts and awaited the fix
that Jayco Corp developed, there was no occasion for
relevant staff at Jayco
Corp to give any serious consideration to a replacement RV, or to some
commercial arrangement with Jayco
Sydney if the dealer had determined to provide
by the time the two Jayco Corp managers spoke to
Consumer JT
I find was on or after 1 February 2016, Jayco Corp had developed its
fix for the bed lid design defect, and from the viewpoint
of its warranty
obligations, I am not persuaded that it was unreasonable for Jayco Corp to take
the view that the defect that was
the apparent cause of the leaking, could be
easily repaired.
in light of the above circumstances, I am not persuaded that there was any
relevant absence of good faith by Jayco Corp, and I am
not persuaded that
there was in the circumstances any unconscionable obstruction by Jayco Corp
Consumer JT
’s ability to seek a replacement RV or a refund
from Jayco Sydney.
Consumer JT
did pursue the course of seeking a
refund or replacement RV, including by making a complaint to New South Wales
Fair Trading, and
then meeting with Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney, before
agreeing to have his RV repaired.
Consumer TB
primary findings in relation to
Consumer TB
include that
Consumer TB
purchased his Expanda RV from Jayco Sydney, and took
delivery on 23 May 2013. He had Jayco Sydney and Jayco Canberra attend
of the RV on the occasions to which I have referred at [
] above, and it was subsequently
transported to the Jayco Corp factory in Dandenong for further repairs, and
returned to
Consumer TB
in November 2014. I have found that
Consumer TB
’s RV failed to comply with the statutory guarantee
of acceptable quality, and that the failure was a major failure because
reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the nature and extent of the failure
would not have acquired the RV. I find that the
full extent of the failure to
comply with the statutory guarantee did not emerge until at least
5 August 2014, at the time at which
Mr Holman of Jayco Sydney
prepared a quotation for repairs.
shall be necessary to consider further aspects of the interactions between
Consumer TB
, Jayco Sydney, Jayco Canberra, and Jayco Corp in order
to evaluate the ACCC’s claim that in the case of
Consumer TB
Jayco Corp engaged in conduct that was in all the circumstances
unconscionable.
Jayco Corp’s perspective, the evidence is that on 8 July 2013,
Mr Manning authorised new mattresses for
Consumer TB
] above). Otherwise,
there is an absence of direct evidence in relation to Jayco Corp approving any
warranty repairs by Jayco Sydney
in July 2013, or by Jayco Canberra in
November 2013.
Consumer TB
experienced difficulties in his dealings with Jayco Canberra, which was the
dealer that he attended for the purpose of repairs in
November 2013 and in
the first half of 2014.
Consumer TB
sent an email to
Mr Manning of Jayco Corp on 27 February 2014, to which I referred
] above, in which he
referred to various issues with the RV, and stated that the RV was booked in at
Jayco Canberra on 13 March 2014
to make another attempt at repairing
the air-conditioning. Mr Manning responded the same day, by sending the
email to Jayco Canberra
Consumer TB
was copied, to which I
referred at [
] above, which
Consumer TB
accepted in cross-examination was a proper and prompt
Thereafter,
Consumer TB
telephoned Jayco Canberra twice seeking to have his RV
assessed before the scheduled booking on 13 March 2014, so that any
could be ordered. His calls were not returned, as a result of which he
sent the email to Mr Manning, which I have set out at [
] above, in which he asked
Mr Manning to investigate Jayco refunding the purchase price of the RV.
Mr Manning responded the following
day on 5 March 2014,
blind-copying Mr Bilbija of Jayco Sydney, stating that he could not help
with a refund, and that this would
have to be done via the selling dealer, as it
had the sales contract (see [
Consumer TB
then sent emails to Mr Manning on
5 and 12 March 2014 concerning further difficulties that he was
experiencing in having his calls
to Jayco Canberra returned, and then having the
service manager at Jayco Canberra pay attention to his concerns. Mr Manning
was responsive
to these emails, first asking
Consumer TB
to keep him
updated and later contacting Jayco Canberra himself to advance
Consumer TB
’s repairs.
29 April 2014,
Consumer TB
copied Mr Manning into,
and also forwarded an email to Jayco Canberra that I have set out at [
] above in which he expressed
frustration about its failure to update him about parts, and to repair the air
conditioning unit in
his RV. Again, Mr Manning responded promptly the
following day by sending an email to Mr Lustri of Jayco Canberra asking
Consumer TB

26 June 2014, Mr Manning corresponded with Jayco Canberra

’s request to Jayco Canberra
] above) for an
extension of his warranty, and a claim for compensation on the ground that the
RV had been off the road for extended
periods. Mr Manning’s response
to Jayco Canberra was to extend the Jayco warranty by one month, and to state
that all repairs
had a 12 month warranty from completion anyway
14 July 2014, Mr Manning spoke to
Consumer TB
telephone, following which he sent an email to Mr Bilbija of Jayco Sydney
which I have set out at [
above, foreshadowing that
Consumer TB
would be calling
Mr Bilbija about a refund or a new RV. I have found at [
] that during this conversation
Mr Manning informed
Consumer TB
that the decision to replace an
RV was one for the selling dealer.
this period at about mid-2014, Jayco Canberra produced three warranty claims to
which I have referred at [
] above, which I find were presented
to Jayco Corp for payment.
next relevant course of events commenced on 4 August 2014, when
Consumer TB
took his RV to Jayco Sydney, and it was assessed by
Mr Holman, who prepared a quotation for repairs that Ms Guy sent to
above). There was then a course of email communications involving, variously,
Consumer TB
, Jayco Sydney and Jayco Corp in relation to a request by
Consumer TB
for a replacement RV that he made in his email of
7 August 2014 to Mr Manning to which I referred at [
] above. Mr Bilbija was copied
into, or was forwarded, many of those emails, which

Consumer TB

(7) the email from Mr Holman to
Consumer TB
13 August 2014 and copied to Mr Bilbija and Mr Manning, in which
Mr Holman stated that the RV was repairable, and that the repairs
deemed to be major, and did not substantiate a request for a replacement RV
above evidence shows that there were three occasions on which
Consumer TB
communicated to Mr Manning and requested a refund,
or a replacement RV –
(1) by email on 4 March 2014;
(2) by telephone on 14 July 2014; and
(3) by email on 7 August 2014.
each of those occasions, Mr Manning ensured that Mr Bilbija of Jayco
Sydney was made aware of the requests, because he either emailed
his reply, or
in the case of the request of 14 July 2014, he separately emailed
Mr Bilbija advising him of the request. On each of
these three occasions,
Mr Manning advised
Consumer TB
that he should make the request
to the selling dealer. Mr Manning followed up the third request with
Mr Holman by three emails. In
response to the third of those emails,
Mr Holman advised Mr Manning that he would present his findings to
Mr Bilbija, following which
Mr Holman prepared his draft email to
Mr Morgan, and subsequently copied Mr Manning and Mr Bilbija into
the email to
Consumer TB
of 13 August 2014, advising that
the RV was repairable, and that the repairs were not deemed to be major, and did
not substantiate
his request for a replacement RV. In addition, when
raised the question of a replacement RV with Mr Rigby, to which I
referred at [
] above, Mr Rigby
communicated that request to the supplier sending an email to Mr Holman of Jayco
am not persuaded that the conduct of Jayco Corp towards
Consumer TB
was unconscionable in all the circumstances. The statutory framework of
rights and obligations is again relevant in the case of
Consumer TB
The respective liabilities of Jayco Sydney, and Jayco Corp were different, and I
have rejected the ACCC’s claim that there
existed a procedure under which
dealers were required to seek Jayco Corp’s approval before agreeing to
provide a refund, or
a replacement RV.
course that Jayco Corp proposed and adopted was to take
Consumer TB
’s RV back to its factory for repairs. While that
was not the course that
Consumer TB
preferred, I do not
consider that in the circumstances Jayco Corp failed to act in good faith in
proposing that it repair the RV at
the factory under its express warranty
obligations. The impression that I formed from all of the evidence, not only in
relation to
the four Consumers, was that there was never really any reluctance
by Jayco Corp to authorise repairs that were shown to be reasonable.
quality of Jayco Corp’s proposal in August 2014 to take the RV back
to the factory for repairs rather than providing a replacement
RV is to be
evaluated in the context of the evidence about how the Jayco RVs were hand
assembled at its Dandenong factory. Jayco
Corp’s conduct in making the
proposal is also to be evaluated together with the information that
Mr Manning gave to the consumer
that he should contact the dealer in
relation to his requests for a replacement RV, or a refund. That can hardly be
characterised
as lacking good faith when, under the ACL, it was the dealer and
not Jayco Corp that was liable to the consumer in that regard. Not
Mr Manning refer the consumer to the dealer, he also notified the dealer of
the situation on the three relevant occasions.
On the third of those occasions,
he actively followed the matter up, seeking to know from Mr Holman what
Mr Bilbija, the dealer principal,
had decided. Mr Holman informed
Mr Manning that he was going to present his findings to Mr Bilbija for
a decision, the result of
which was Mr Holman’s email to the consumer
dated 13 August 2014 denying his request to which Mr Manning was
copied. Mr Rigby
likewise notified Jayco Sydney of
Consumer TB
request on 31 October 2014. The conduct and knowledge of Mr Manning and Mr
Rigby to which I have referred are to be attributed
to Jayco Corp.
than obstructing
Consumer TB
’s rights under the ACL to seek a
refund or a replacement RV, and asserting an entitlement to attempt further
repairs, Mr Manning
facilitated the exercise of the
Consumer TB
’s rights by referring him to the dealer, and then
deferred to and allowed the dealer to make its own decision. Thereafter,
Consumer TB
in a broad sense exercised his rights by making a
complaint to New South Wales Fair Trading, the result of which was that he was
advised that because Jayco Corp had offered to repair the RV, he could not
obtain a refund (see [
above). As I have mentioned, the basis for, and the reasonableness of that
advice is not an issue before the Court.
ACCC challenged Mr Bilbija, Mr Holman, and Mr Manning about
whether the repairs to
Consumer TB
’s RV were major repairs
having regard to the cost of repairs, and the witnesses gave varying answers on
that question, that
I consider represented honestly held differences of opinion.
I do not consider that this line of cross-examination went directly
to the real
issue, which was not the characterisation of the repairs as being major or not,
but whether there was an absence of good
faith by Jayco Corp in its appraisal of
the RV, having regard to its warranty obligations set against the statutory
framework of
liabilities.
Some final observations
ACCC’s case that Jayco Corp engaged in conduct that was in all the
circumstances unconscionable has failed for three principal
reasons. The
is the rejection of the ACCC’s claim that Jayco Corp required
its dealers to obtain its approval before agreeing to replace
an RV, or to
refund the purchase price pursuant to an obligation under the ACL to do so.
While there was consultation between Jayco
Corp and the relevant dealers which,
unremarkably, may have influenced the dealers’ response to requests for
refunds or replacement
RVs, the evidence fell well short of proving control over
the dealers’ decisions. The failure to prove that element of the
ACCC’s claim, which would have been significant if it had been
established, then informed the basis on which other elements
reason relates to the close attention to all the factual
circumstances that is required by the judicial technique referred to in
. That technique required that regard be had to the information
that the relevant employees of Jayco Corp possessed at the material
relation to each individual Consumer’s RV, and to the evaluation of Jayco
Corp’s conduct in the circumstances
existing at the material times having
regard to that information. When close attention was given to Jayco Corp’s
this way, it was clear that the conduct could not be characterised as
unconscionable.
, and probably the most important reason, relates to the statutory
framework of rights and liabilities established by the ACL in relation
supply of goods and services. The features of the statutory matrix of rights and
liabilities under the ACL, and the place
of manufacturers’ warranties
within that scheme, have been referred to at length in these reasons. Under that
legislation,
Jayco Corp was not directly liable to the Consumers to replace the
RV, or to refund the purchase price, in the event of a major failure
with a statutory guarantee. Jayco Corp’s direct liability was under the
terms of its warranty, pursuant to which
it was not liable to replace the entire
RV, still less refund the purchase price that the consumer paid to the supplier.
of the Consumers under the ACL against the suppliers were separate
rights, of which Jayco Corp gave notice to the Consumers in its
contained in the owner’s handbook in accordance with the regulations: cf,
at [334]-[335] (Beach J). The ACCC’s claim that
Jayco Corp acted unconscionably in not exercising its discretion under the
manufacturer’s
warranty to replace the Consumers’ RVs has been
rejected for a number of reasons that are particular to the cases of the four
Consumers. But standing back, one of the difficulties that the ACCC’s
claim faced was that it was tantamount to alleging that
Jayco Corp was required
to assume a direct liability to a consumer to replace goods as if it were the
supplier of the goods, in circumstances where the legislation
made the supplier so liable. The legislation then had the effect of
establishing
a commercial setting in which the supplier and the manufacturer might then work
out between themselves how the consequential
burden of that liability to the
consumer would ultimately be borne. Good conscience did not require that Jayco
Corp accept additional
direct liabilities to consumers which were otherwise not
supported by the legislative scheme.
Conclusions
have found that Jayco Corp contravened
(1)(m) of the ACL by
Mr Manning’s statements to
Consumer RH
in his email dated
5 May 2015 to which I referred at [
] above. Otherwise, the ACCC has not
established its claims.
