Report 11: September 1996
Community Law Reform Committee
This report was tabled in the ACT Legislative Assembly
on 26/9/96 by the Attorney-General, Mr Gary Humphries.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
COMMUNITY LAW REFORM COMMITTEE
REPORT NO. 11
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - CIVIL ISSUES
In its Report the Community Law Reform Committee
recommends;
. That on receiving an
application for a protection order the Registrar of the Court
should be required to fix a date for the hearing
of the application
within 2 days unless;
a) an interim order is not sought (if an interim
order is sought the application comes before the Court as soon
as possible), and
b) it is unlikely that the respondent can be served
within that time.
In these circumstances the Registrar may fix a date
for the hearing of the application within 21 days of receipt (
Recommendation
) [Currently all applications are returnable within 2
. That provision be made
enabling the Court to make an Interim Protection Order for an
initial period of up to 21 days if it appears
unlikely that the
respondent would be served within the normal initial period of
up to 10 days from the date upon which the order
Recommendation
) [Currently all Interim Orders initially remain in force
for up to 10 days].
Note:- In relation to paragraphs 1 and 2 above
the capacity of a respondent to apply to revoke or vary an order
at any time is unaffected.
. That the maximum duration
of a Protection Order be extended from one to two years or for
any duration (including until further order)
that the Court may
specify if special reasons exist. A procedure enabling an Order
to be extended beyond any specified period is
also recommended.
Recommendations 3-5
) [Currently all protection
orders last for 12 months with no capacity for extension].
That the grounds for
the making of an order should exclude the criterion of 'likely
to engage in conduct or in further conduct that
would constitute
a domestic violence offence' (in relation to actual or threatened
violence) and that the applicant 'fears for their
safety' (in
relation to harassing or intimidating conduct) (
Recommendations
That a definition of
'domestic violence' be inserted extending to the 'objects and
principles of the Act' (also to be inserted).
Accordingly the
grounds for obtaining an order would simply relate to the specified
conduct which constitutes 'domestic violence'
as defined (
Recommendations
8-11 and 15
That the provisions
of the Domestic Violence Act prescribing the form and content
of an order should be consolidated (
Recommendation 12
. That the Court be required
(in addition to the matters already detailed at section 10) to
have regard to the particular circumstances
of each matter and
the available prohibitions, directions and conditions available
in determining what order if any should be made
Recommendation
). In determining a matter the Court should also be
required to have regard to any history of domestic violence, any
previous orders,
the circumstances relating to any incidence of
non compliance with previous orders (
Recommendation 14
and the need to ensure that property is protected from damage
Recommendation 16
). The CLRC further recommends
that the above criterion should also be applied by the Court in
determining applications to revoke
or vary an order (
Recommendation
That the distinction
between the Domestic Violence Act 1986, and Part X of the
Magistrates
Court Act 1930
(relating to restraining orders by persons who
cannot apply under the Domestic Violence Act) be preserved with
to be rectified (
Recommendation
[The recommendations contained in the report assimilate
the two enactments making them identical other than in relation
to the persons
who may seek protection. In this regard Part X
Magistrates Court Act 1930
enables any person, other than
those who may apply under the Domestic Violence Act, to apply
for a Restraining Order. The Domestic
Violence Act in effect enables
persons in spousal, household based, or family relationships to
apply for a Protection Order. The
report recommends against extending
the Domestic Violence Act to include 'non-cohabiting intimate
relationships'. Whilst the distinction
may be semantic the CLRC
considered that the nature of the domestic violence strategy outlined
in Report no. 9 (relating to criminal
proceedings) necessitates
the preservation of the Domestic Violence Act and the integrity
of the principles it reflects (pp. 66-68).]
. (a) That the Community
Advocate be able to apply for orders on behalf a person under
disability as defined in the Community Advocate
Act 1991. Consequential
recommendations relate to rights of appearance by the person on
whose behalf an application has been made.
In this way the 'best
interest advocacy' role of the Community Advocate is preserved.
(b)That any person may make application on behalf
of another person with the leave of the Court (
Recommendations
. That the Court or
the Registrar be required to notify the Community Advocate and
the Director of Family Services of circumstances
where it is considered
that the variation or revocation of an order may compromise the
protection of a child (
Recommendations 21 and 22
. That in relation to
the protection of children;
(a) the endorsement of the proposal to amend the
Children's Services Act 1986
to extend the criteria by which a
child is deemed in need of care to include exposure to 'behaviour
that is or is likely to be harmful
to a child';
(b )the endorsement of the proposal enabling the
Court when making a child care order to include terms relating
to the protection
of the child (
Recommendation 23
(c) the Director of Family Services and or the Community
Advocate be given the capacity to appear in any proceedings relating
(d) the development of guidelines relating to any
intervention in proceedings by the Community Advocate and/or the
Director of Family
Services and the duty of a legal practitioners
to notify matters relating to the care and protection of children
Recommendations 24-25
That the Chief Magistrate
be given the capacity to authorise the Registrar and such legally
qualified Deputy Registrars of the Court
to make any orders consented
to by all parties (
Recommendations 26-28
. That the Court be
given the capacity to hear and determine an application to revoke
or vary an order at any time (
Recommendations 30-31
[Currently an order may only be varied after Service on the respondent).
. That the Court be
given the capacity to recommend that any party participate in
any specified program of training, rehabilitation
or assessment
Recommendation
. That provisions relating
to the publication of proceedings and the release of information
be clarified (
Recommendations 33-39
That procedural matters
be expressed and consolidated in the Domestic Violence Act (
Recommendations
That provision be
made for the mandatory cancellation of a weapons licence at the
time an Order is made and enabling the seizure
and detention of
any dangerous or restricted weapon for the duration of an order
Recommendations 51-54
In relation to the
(a) that a coronial inquiry be mandatory in cases
of 'Domestic Homicide' with any such inquiry to include an examination
of systemic
issues. Provisions should also be enacted enabling
the Coroner to seek the assistance of the Domestic Violence Project
Co-ordinator
to compile and submit relevant information, and
(b)that the Coroner be required to submit a report
to the Attorney General, the Domestic Violence Advisory Council,
the Domestic Violence
Co-ordinator and any individual or agency
named in the report (
Recommendations 55-60
. That the drafting
and layout of the Domestic Violence Act be simplified (
Recommendation
That criminal sanctions
for non compliance with an Order be relocated in the
with an extract of that provision attached to the Domestic
Violence Act (
Recommendation 62
1. Introduction
1. The Committee has dealt with its reference on domestic violence by releasing two Reports. The first Report
(Report number 9 - Domestic Violence )
in December 1995 deals with reform of the criminal justice system and
the agencies dealing with domestic violence in that
system. The
introduction to that report details the background to the terms of
reference and the Committee's methodology and is not
repeated in this
report. This Report reviews the civil system for securing protection
from violence or harassment .
2. This Report encompasses the first review of civil issues relating to
domestic violence in the A.C.T. since the Australian Law
Reform Commission's
Report released in 1986. The Report specifically addresses terms of reference
(a) and (f).
3. The Committee in this Report has sought to integrate the holistic approach
espoused in the first Report to the comprehensive civil
system which presently
exists in the A.C.T. for protection from violence and harassment detailed
primarily in the
Domestic Violence Act 1986 .
The Committee's
recommendations seek to enhance this system and assimilate a greater degree of
consistency with the provisions of
Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act 1930
(which provides a protective regime for persons in non domestic
situations). In so doing the Committee has sought to retain the integrity
Domestic Violence Act 1986
and the principles pertinent to the
enactment of that legislation whilst ensuring a consistent regime for the
protection of all persons
from violence or harassment.
Duration and procedure on expiration of protection
4. The Committee's terms of reference require consideration of the effectiveness
of domestic violence orders having regard to the
time limitations imposed and
the procedure on the expiration of the orders.
In this chapter the Committee deals with the duration
of interim and final protection orders; the procedure to obtain further protection
when a final order expires; and, for convenience, the requirement in section 6
Domestic Violence Act
, that the hearing date of an application must
not be more that 2 days after the application is filed.
5. At present a final protection order can remain in force for up to 12 months,
and the period is specified in the order.
protection order contains a number of separate provisions (for example, that the
respondent be restrained from approaching
the applicant; that the respondent be
restrained from contacting the applicant) different periods can be set against
each provision
but none can individually exceed 12 months.
6. At the end of the period of a final protection order, the order
automatically lapses.
7. Most cases start with an interim (temporary) protection order and proceed
to a final protection order.
As a matter of practice,
where an interim protection order is sought ex parte (without notice to the
respondent on grounds
of urgency), the Court makes the application for a protection
order returnable before the Court on the date of filing (being the
which the interim protection order is sought). If an interim protection order
is not sought the application for a
protection order must be listed for hearing
within 2 days of the date of filing.
8. An initial interim protection order remains in force for a period of up
to 10 days, and the period is specified by the court.
The application for the
protection order is adjourned to a date prior to the expiration of the 10 day
period, coinciding with
the period that the interim protection order is to remain
in force. At the end of that period, the Court can extend the interim
order so that it remains in force until the date fixed for the further hearing
of the application for the protection
9. While 67% of interim protection orders granted between 1989 and 1991 were
for 10 days or less the rest were in place for longer
periods of time, by virtue
of the extension of the original. This often occurs because of difficulties
in serving the respondent
or because unresolved but related matters are pending
in the Family Court.
Eight percent were 61 days
or longer. The longest was 293 days and the average was 143 days.
10. Between 1991 and 1989, about 98% of protection orders were granted for
the maximum 12 month period. The remaining 2% were
for periods of between one
and six months.
Twelve percent of final protection
orders were revoked before their term was completed.
11. The period of the final protection order dates from the day it is made.
Consequently, where an interim order is followed by a
final order the total
period covered is, in most cases, somewhat more than a year, and in some
instances, substantially more.
12. If the applicant or the respondent want to vary or stop an interim or
final protection order, before the order expires, an
application must be made
to the court. The considerations in relation to an application for variation
or revocation (cancellation)
are the same as the considerations listed in the
Domestic Violence Act
concerning the granting of a protection order.
The Committee deals with variation and revocation later
in this report.
13. If the applicant wants to extend an interim protection order the applicant
must appear at court or instruct a solicitor to appear
on their behalf. If the
respondent has been served and appears at court a further interim order can be
made with the respondents
consent. If the respondent does not consent a
Magistrate can hear and determine the application for an extension. If the
has been served but does not appear, an application for extension of
the interim order or, more usually, the application for the
final protection
order can be determined in the respondent's absence.
Domestic Violence Act
stands, it is not possible for the
Court to grant an extension of the maximum 12 month period. The applicant can
apply for a fresh
order. In order to do so a fresh application must be filed in
court and served on the respondent. This application is determined
on the same
criteria as the original application - there are no special criteria for a
second or subsequent applications.
15. It is important to note that where a respondent is not in Court at the
time a protection order is granted, the offence of
contravening a protection
order cannot be made out unless the respondent has been personally served with
Requirement
that the application be listed for hearing within 2 days of
16. Section 6 of the
Domestic Violence Act
requires that an application
for a protection order be listed for hearing within 2 days of the date on which
the application is
filed. This requirement exists to ensure that the Court deals
with applications quickly. The Court's compliance rate is high.
17. Until the application for a protection order is heard there is no order,
interim or final, in existence. There are cases where
the 2 day requirement is
problematic. Where an applicant is not seeking an ex parte order (an order made
without notice to the respondent
on grounds of urgency), the applicant may know
that the 2 day period will not be sufficient for the respondent to be served
the application. This is likely to be the case where, for example, the
respondent is not in the ACT, or is in transit, or where the
respondent's
whereabouts are otherwise not known. At the moment there is no flexibility and
the applicant must come back to Court
and apply for an extension.
18. The Committee considers that while ensuring that the Court continues to
deal with the applications quickly, somewhat more flexible
arrangements are
needed to overcome the problem of needless and meaningless court attendances
prior to service.
19. The Committee considers that section 6 of the
Domestic Violence Act
should be amended to provide that the Registrar must fix a date for the hearing
of an application for a protection order that is
not more than 2 days after the
date on which the application is filed
* the applicant is not intending to seek an ex parte order; and
* the Registrar is satisfied that it is unlikely that the respondent can be
served with the application within the 2 day period.
20. In these circumstances, and provided that there is an application by the
applicant for the Registrar to do so, the Registrar
should be able to specify a
hearing date which is up to 21 days from the date the application is filed.
Recommendation 1:
That section 6 of the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to
(a) The Registrar shall fix a date for the hearing of an application for a
protection order that is not more than 2 days after the
date on which the
application is filed,
(i) the applicant is not intending to seek an ex parte order; and
(ii) the Registrar is satisfied, on the application of the applicant, that
it is unlikely that the respondent can be served with
the application within
the 2 day period;
(b) Where the Registrar is satisfied that the return date for an
application should be extended, the Registrar shall fix a date for
the application that is not more than 21 days after the date on which the
application is filed.
in relation to duration
21. The effect of sub-section 17(3) of the
Domestic Violence Act
an initial interim protection order remains in force for a period not exceeding
10 days. As previously stated, at the end
of the period of an initial interim
protection order, the Court can extend the interim order so that it remains in
force until the
date fixed for the further hearing of the application for the
protection order.
22. All of the submissions to the Committee which addressed the maximum
duration of an initial interim protection order supported
some form of
extension of that period.
23. The issues raised were:
* that in many cases 10 days is not long enough to allow the police to serve
the interim protection order and the application for
the final protection order
on the respondent;
* that if the respondent is not served the applicant must attend court to apply
for an extension of the interim order and this may
happen several times; and
* that it should be possible for the Court to grant an automatic extension of
the interim order without the applicant being required
to attend court.
24. The difficulties identified relate to ex parte orders.
25. The need for the applicant to reappear at Court when the respondent has not
been served can be overcome where the applicant has
a lawyer, and the applicant
instructs the lawyer to seek an extension of the interim order. In this context
it should be noted that
most applicants are represented by the service provided
by the Legal Aid Office at the Magistrates Court.
26. In some cases, it may be apparent from the outset that serving the
respondent is likely to be difficult and that 10 days may
not be sufficient.
27. It would not be desirable, however, for the standard period that an initial
interim protection order may remain in force to be
longer than 10 days where
service is not likely to be problematic. To do so would extend the period
during which the interim order
is current before the respondent has the
opportunity to be heard before the Court. This could result in an increase in
applications
by respondents to have the hearing dates brought forward.
28. Whilst noting that a respondent may pursuant to section 18 of the Domestic
Violence Act 1986 apply to vary or revoke an interim
protection order at any
time where an order is in force, the Committee considers that the
Violence Act
should be amended to allow the Court to grant an interim
protection order for a period longer than 10 days in cases where the Court
satisfied that it is likely that the 10 day period will not be sufficient for
the respondent to be served with the initial interim
order and the application
for the protection order. There should however, be a limit. The Committee has
selected 21 days.
Recommendation 2:
That sub-section 17(3) of the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to
(a) An interim protection order remains in force for a period not exceeding
10 days, as the Court specifies in the order,
the Court is
satisfied, on the application of the applicant, that it is unlikely that the
respondent can be served with the initial
interim order and the application for
the protection within the 10 day period.
(b) Where the Court is satisfied that the period an interim protection
order is to remain in force should be extended, the Court
may grant an interim
protection order for a period not exceeding 21 days.
29. As noted above, most final protection orders are made for the maximum
duration of 12 months and most run their full term.
30. All of the submissions to the Committee which addressed the question of
the time limit on final protection orders called for
the present 12 month period
to be extended, although different ways of achieving this were suggested.
Where a fixed time period was suggested the most common
period was 2 years.
31. The Research Paper reported that the 12 months duration was generally
not considered problematic by the Magistrates interviewed
or by court staff
and legal practitioners (three legal aid lawyers and one private lawyer) interviewed,
although some interviewees
spoke of the need for `renewal' or a further protection
order at the end of the 12 months.
32. The Research Paper contains no statistics on the number of applications
for 'renewal' of a 12 month order which has run its
full term. However, anecdotal
evidence suggests that the number of such applications is low.
This could indicate a low level of demand for longer
orders based on the fact that 12 months is sufficient in most cases. On the
other hand, it could indicate a range of problems, such as potential applicants
being deterred by perceptions about the difficulty
of obtaining a new order,
or disenchantment with the protection provided by an order. In relation to the
latter, concerns about
lack of police action on breaches was raised repeatedly
in the Research Paper.
Issues relating to policing
in domestic violence cases, including breach of protection orders, have already
been dealt with
by the Committee in Part 1 of this report.
33. Many of the submissions which dealt with the duration of final protection
orders considered that the central problem with the
12 month limit was that
risk to the victim may be ongoing and, in any event, it may be impossible to
work out in advance how long
the order will be needed. It was noted that most
orders were made shortly after separation of the parties, and that the post
period involves considerable adjustment for both. Where the parties
are married they are eligible to apply for divorce after 12 months
separation.
This may coincide with the protection order ceasing. It was submitted that the
divorce can be a further flashpoint. It
was noted that, in these circumstances,
the 12 month limitation, and concern about what will happen when the order
ceases, can be
stressful for the protected person.
34. It was pointed out that the 12 month time limit, and in fact any time
limit, is arbitrary and inflexible, and no fixed time limit
will be appropriate
in all cases.
35. The Research Paper noted that the grounds on which Magistrates consider
an application for a fresh protection order, following
the expiration of a final
order, remain unclear.
There are three main problems:
* Firstly, some Magistrates take the view that a fresh application cannot be
considered while the previous order is still in existence,
which means that
there will be a gap when no protection order is in place.
* Secondly, there have been instances where a further protection order was
refused because there were no new incidents during the
period covered by the
previous order (which may be ironic, because the reason why there were no new
incidents may be that the protection
order worked). That is, there have been
instances where the Court has proceeded on the basis that fresh incidents were
justify a further order.
* Finally, the need to apply for a fresh order means that the court legal
process must be started all over again.
in other jurisdictions
36. In New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Tasmania there is no limit
on the duration of an order but a period of time must
be specified by the court.
37. In South Australia there is no limit and the court does not have to specify
the period of the order.
38. In Queensland a protection order continues for a period no longer than
2 years, unless there are special reasons. If there
are special reasons an order
can continue for longer than 2 years, and there is no limit on duration of such
an order. The
period of the order is as determined by the Court and is set out
in the order. In addition, the legislation allows a protection
order to be made
while an existing order is in force, to take effect at the end of the existing
39. In Western Australia the order lasts for 12 months unless the court specifies
otherwise, and the period specified can be longer
than 12 months.
40. Victoria has virtually the same provision as the ACT, that is a maximum
of 12 months or such shorter period as the court specifies.
New Zealand Domestic Violence Act
American Model
State Family Violence Code
developed by the National Council of Juvenile
& Family Court Judges, each provide that an order for protection continues
until further order of the court (that is, there is no time limit and the period
of the order is not specified).
42. The 12 month maximum in the ACT is consequently, with Victoria, the most
limited in Australia.
43. The Committee considers that the following principles are relevant to the
evaluation of options in relation to the duration of
protection orders:
* the safety of the victim and any children should be paramount;
* natural justice and due process should be observed;
* the number of court appearances should be kept to a minimum;
* resources implications should be considered.
44. Court appearances should be kept to a minimum not only because of resource
implications for the Court, the service provided by
the Legal Aid Office, the
Domestic Violence Crisis Service (DOCS) and the police (who handle and serve
orders), but because of the
time and strain involved for the parties and the
cost to one or both of the parties if they are paying for their legal
representation.
45. While automatic lapsing of a protection order has the advantage that
neither party needs to make an application or go to court
to have the order
stopped, it also means that the order will stop whether it continues to be
needed or not.
46. It is important to note that legislative provisions which deal with a final
protection order of fixed duration are linked to
provisions about extension.
Where an order will lapse at a specified time, extension criteria must be
available. Criteria which involve
a gap in protection, or which assume that it
will be possible to personally serve the respondent, or which place the onus on
applicant to justify the continuation of the order are problematic. The
latter is problematic because of the evidentiary catch 22
referred to above,
that is, that there may not have been further incidents since the order was
granted precisely because the order
was in place. The current provisions in the
Domestic Violence Act have each of these flaws.
47. The only way around all of these problems is to amend the current limited
duration provision in relation to final protection
orders and to replace it
with a provision which stipulates that a final protection order continues in
force until further order of
the Court. However, there are other ramifications
arising from this option and these are dealt with below.
48. The Committee considers that if time limited/automatic lapsing orders are
to be retained (leaving aside for the moment the question
of the duration of
the automatically lapsing order), the renewal mechanism should ensure that
there is no gap in protection, the
procedure should be as simple as possible,
and the onus should be on the respondent to satisfy the Court that the order
49. The Committee considers that the following best achieve the identified
objectives in relation to extension of protection orders:
* A protected person who seeks an extension of their protection order must
lodge a Notice Requesting Extension not later than 21
days prior to the
expiration of the order (unless the Court grants leave to lodge the notice out
* The Court must fix a date for hearing of the Notice Requesting Extension not
more than 14 days after the date on which the notice
is filed, and arrange
service of the notice on the respondent.
* The Notice Requesting Extension must state that the request for extension of
the protection order will be granted on the hearing
date, with the extension to
take effect on the date of the expiration of the current order, if the
respondent does not file a Notice
Opposing Extension of the order.
* If there is insufficient time for service of the Notice Requesting Extension,
or if service is not effected by the hearing date,
the Court should have the
power to grant the request for extension ex parte on the oral evidence of the
applicant (which can be presented
on the hearing date). If this occurs the
protection order should state that the respondent can apply to have the order
by filing a Notice Opposing Extension within 7 days of being
personally served with the extended order.
* If the respondent is served and the respondent files a Notice Opposing
Extension but there is insufficient time to hear and determine
the case before
the expiration of the protection order the Court should have the power to grant
an interim extension of the order
pending hearing.
* If the respondent files a Notice Opposing Extension but does not appear on
the return date, and the Court is not satisfied that
an adjournment is
warranted, the Notice Opposing Extension should be dismissed.
* If the respondent does not file a Notice Opposing Extension, or if the notice
is dismissed, (either because the respondent does
not appear on the hearing
date, or by determination of the Court), the Court should automatically extend
the protection order for
the period requested by the applicant (subject to any
maximum period in the legislation) and arrange for the respondent to be
served with the extended order.
* If the respondent files a Notice Opposing Extension and there is a hearing,
the onus should be on the respondent to satisfy the
Court that the protection
order should not be extended.
* There should be no limit on the number of extensions which can be granted.
* Any protection order should include notice to the applicant and the
respondent of the above procedure.
(The Committee will refer to these steps as `the extension procedure'.)
50. In considering options in relation to the duration of a final protection
order, it should be noted that any increase of the present
period of 12 months
fixed duration carries with it a risk that the respondent may be less likely to
consent to the order at the outset,
and that consequently more defended matters
may go before the Court. The Committee considers that the likelihood of this
may increase with the length and uncertainty of the duration of the
order. The higher the number of matters requiring defended hearing,
the call on resources.
51. The Committee has isolated the following options from submissions and the
Discussion Paper:
In force until further order of the Court
52. This acknowledges that setting a specific time limit will always be
arbitrary and it would remove the need and ability to negotiate
over duration.
It would do away with the need for the applicant to apply for an extension of
the protection order, or a new order,
and it is the only option which provides
a complete solution to the possible service problems relating to extensions.
53. Automatic lapsing is removed. This means that in every case, where one of
the parties wants the protection order cancelled, an
application to that effect
would have to be made to the Court.
54. However, all protection orders, regardless of the circumstances, would
potentially last a lifetime. With the knowledge that a
protection order will
last indefinitely more contested cases are likely and the Court may be more
55. It can be argued that protection orders should be maintained only for as
long as they are needed and warranted, and that orders
which last longer
unjustifiably infringe the respondent's civil liberties. The Committee
considers that while this has validity in
relation to restraints on the
respondent going to certain places or entering certain premises for example,
protection orders which
restrain the respondent from assaulting the applicant
parallel the criminal law and in practical terms, do not infringe on the
respondent's
civil liberties.
56. While the Committee does not think that it is unreasonable for a respondent
who considers that the protection order is no longer
warranted to bear the onus
of satisfying the Court, the inflexibility of this option and the impact on
resources are significant
Duration of order determined by the court
57. This has the advantage that the Court and/or the parties can attempt to
tailor the duration of the protection order to the circumstances
particular case. The Court would have the option of imposing a time limited
order, for any length of time, or an order expressed
to continue until further
order of the Court.
58. The Discussion Paper suggested that criteria for determining duration might
include: severity of the violence; the length of
time the victim has endured
it; and, any threats made to or about the applicant or the children. However,
even applying these criteria
it may be difficult to determine the appropriate
duration of a protection order in a particular case, and uncertainty about what
the Court may order may result in more cases going before a Magistrate.
Automatic renewal
59. This would involve adding to a limited duration protection order, a
procedure whereby the applicant could automatically renew
the protection order
for a further fixed period, and perhaps repeatedly, simply by applying to the
court. No fresh grounds would
be required.
60. This has the advantage of overcoming uncertainty about grounds for a
further protection order. However, the Committee believes
that, except in
urgent or exceptional cases, natural justice and due process require that the
respondent have the opportunity to
be heard on any application to the Court.
This option does not overcome the potential problem of personal service because
it did not require that the respondent be notified of the application,
the respondent would have to be personally served with the
extension for the
protection order for it to be enforceable.
(iv.) Standard 12 months and the extension procedure
61. This option involves introducing a legislative presumption that the
duration of a protection order will be 12 months, with provision
for the Court
to order an extension of the protection order for a further 12 month period.
The extension procedure would be as detailed
above by the Committee.
62. This option retains automatic lapsing; it introduces a presumption which
would serve to increase certainty; and the extension
procedure overcomes the
negative aspect of lapsing, and addresses the onus issue. However, it does not
overcome the problem of personally
serving the respondent with the extended
protection order and it applies an arbitrary maximum time limit on duration.
Extend the maximum duration
63. This would involve selecting another arbitrary, but longer, maximum
duration. As noted above, the duration which was most frequently
suggested in
submissions to the Committee was 2 years. This extends the period of
protection. Extending the maximum period of protection
orders is less likely to
cause a rise in contested matters than orders which continue until further
order of the Court, or where
the duration of the order is determined by the
Court. Automatic lapsing is retained.
64. As a stand alone option, it has the continuing disadvantage of the need to
apply to the Court for a further order. This problem
could be overcome by
adopting the extension procedure set out above.
65. Each of the options have drawbacks. The Committee considers that the
arrangements which best meet the principles identified at
the outset are as
* The maximum duration of a protection order should be increased to 2 years
subject to the Court having the power, if there are `special
reasons' for doing
so, to grant an order for any duration, including a protection order until
further order of the Court;
* There should be a presumption that, unless the Court otherwise orders, the
orders will last for 2 years;
* 21 days prior to the end of the order the extension procedure, set out above,
should be available.
66. The Committee does not think that it is helpful to attempt to define
`special reasons' although examples may be cases where the
applicant is likely
to be in hiding indefinitely; where the respondent has been sentenced to a term
of imprisonment and the release
date cannot be accurately predicted; or, where
the respondent poses an ongoing risk to the applicant or the applicant's
Recommendation 3:
That the maximum duration of protection orders should be increased to 2
years subject to the Court having the power, if there are
`special reasons' for
doing so, to grant an order for any duration, including until further order of
the Court. Recommendation 4:
There should be a presumption that, unless the Court otherwise orders, an
order will last for 2 years.
Recommendation 5:
21 days prior to the expiration of an order the extension procedure, set
out above, should be available.
Grounds for a protection order
67. Consideration of the current effectiveness of Domestic Violence Protection
Orders, as required by term of reference (a), is integrally
connected with the
basis upon which a protection order may be sought or renewed, or in other
words, the grounds for a protection
order or a subsequent protection order.
68. This chapter deals with the grounds for a protection order, as set out in
section 4 of the
Domestic Violence Act
, in two parts.
69. The first part addresses the problems identified in the submissions to the
Committee that specifically arise from the wording
of section 4 and the fact
that the Domestic Violence Act is silent as to whether the history of domestic
violence including the details
and circumstances of any previous protection
order and the circumstances of any breaches of a previous order may constitute
for, or be relevant to an application for a protection order, or a
subsequent protection order. It concludes with a proposed definition
'domestic violence' for the purpose of the
Domestic Violence Act
70. The second part deals with a number of ancillary matters that would improve
and clarify the grounds for a protection order, and
the structure of the
Domestic Violence Act
. These are: the need for a purpose clause and a
principles clauses in the Act; the grouping of the available content of a
order in one section of the Act; clarification of the purpose of
section 10 (matters to be taken into account); amendment of section
ensure that it is not more restrictive than the equivalent provision in the
Magistrates Court Act
; and, matters to be taken into account in relation
to variation, revocation and further orders.
71. Section 4 of the
Domestic Violence Act
provides for the making of
protection orders. Under sub-section 4(1) the Court can make a protection order
if it is satisfied on
the balance of probabilities that:
"(a) the respondent has engaged in conduct which constitutes a
domestic violence offence and, unless the respondent is restrained,
respondent is likely to engage in further conduct which would constitute that
or another domestic violence offence;
respondent has threatened to engage in conduct that would constitute a
domestic violence offence and, unless the respondent is restrained,
respondent is likely to engage in conduct that would constitute that or another
domestic violence offence; or
(c) the respondent
has engaged in conduct of such an offensive or harassing
nature in respect of-
(i) a spouse of the respondent;
(ii) a relative;
(iii) a household member; or
(iv) a child of the spouse or of the respondent;
(v) the spouse, relative, household member
or child fears for his or her
(vi) the spouse fears for the safety of the child"
Domestic Violence Act
seeks to regulate future activity based on
past conduct, whether or not that conduct was engaged within or outside the ACT.
73. Section 10 (1) of the Act sets out the matters to be taken into account in
determining an application for a protection order.
That is, the Court must have
regard to the following:
"(a) the need to ensure that the aggrieved person is protected
from violence or harassment;
(b) the welfare of a child affected,
or likely to be affected, by the
respondent's conduct;
(c) the accommodation needs of the aggrieved person, the children (if any)
the aggrieved person and the children (if any) of the respondent;
(d) any hardship that may be caused to the respondent or to
any other person
as a result of the making of the order;
(e) where the Court proposes to include in the order a prohibition or
...[ prohibiting the respondent from taking possession of specified
personal property, being property that is reasonably needed by
the aggrieved
person; or a direction that the respondent give specified personal property
that is in the possession of the respondent
and is reasonably needed by the
aggrieved person to the aggrieved person].. the income, assets and liabilities
of the respondent
and of the aggrieved person (other than an aggrieved person
who is a child);
(f) any other matter that, in the circumstances of
the case, the Court
considers relevant".
74. Section 10(2) provides that the matters
in paragraphs (a) and (b) above are to be considered as being of primary
importance.
75. The decision to make a protection order and the nature of the prohibitions,
directions and conditions contained in an order
are discretionary with each
case decided on its own facts and circumstances.
76. In this context it should be noted that there is no definition of `domestic
violence' in the
Domestic Violence Act
. Instead, the conduct which
constitutes `domestic violence', for the purpose of the Act, is defined by
reference to the grounds upon
which a protection may be sought, as specified in
section 4 of the Act.
77. Accordingly, the first two elements of `domestic violence', are committing,
or threatening to commit a 'domestic violence offence'.
The third element is
the offensive or harassing conduct ground.
78. The three central issues identified in the submissions to the Committee in
relation to the grounds for a protection order that
specifically arise from the
wording of section 4 are:
* Firstly, the problematic definition of `domestic violence offence', the
central concept of the first two grounds for a protection
* Secondly, whether the likely to commit a domestic violence offence element
in the first two grounds for a protection order should
be retained:
* Thirdly, whether the fear for safety element in the `offensive and harassing
conduct ground'
should be retained.
79. The fourth issue is the lack of certainty about whether the history of
domestic violence including the details and circumstances
of any previous
protection order and the circumstances of any breaches of a previous order
should be relevant to an application for
a protection order, or a subsequent
protection order.
in relation to grounds
Violence Offence
80. The central concept of the first two grounds for a protection order is
`domestic violence offence'. The definition of 'domestic
violence offence' in
Domestic Violence Act
is convoluted and difficult to follow. The Law
Society of the Australian Capital Territory, with the ACT Bar Association
concurring,
submitted to the Committee that:
"The definition [of domestic violence offence] contained in the
[Domestic Violence] Act at present may be useful or comprehensive
draftsman or to someone with an arcane knowledge of sections of the
It probably serves no other useful purpose."
81. The definition is
currently as follows:
provides that "domestic violence offence" means a
committed by a person against a
of the person; a
of the person or of a spouse of the person; a
a household
* Each of the italicised terms are defined in
provides that 'prescribed offence' means:-
"(a) murder or attempted murder;
(b) manslaughter or attempted manslaughter; or
(c) an offence under section 19,
, paragraph 32(1) (a) or 32(2) (a) or
, 92A, 92B. 92C, 92D,
92E, 92F, 92G, 92H, 92J, 92K, 92L, 92M, 493, 494, or 546A of the
an attempt to commit such an offence."
82. As can be seen there
are two problems with the definition of "domestic violence offence":
* Firstly, the amount of detail in the definition; and
* Secondly, the fact that 'prescribed offence' is defined by reference to
offences contained in the
Crimes Act 1900
, and all but two of the thirty
three offences are referred to by section number only. That is, to understand
the definition it is
necessary to refer to another Act.
83. The section numbers currently listed in the definition refer to the
following criminal offences:
* intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm (s. 19)
* recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm (s. 20)
* wounding (s. 21)
* assault with intent to commit certain indictable offences (s. 22)
* intentionally or recklessly inflicting actual bodily harm (s. 25)
* negligently causing grievous bodily harm (s. 25)
* common assault (s. 25)
* acts endangering life, including for example, strangling, suffocating,
administering a drug or poison, discharging a firearm, placing
an explosive,
and interfering with a motor vehicle (s. 27)
* acts endangering health (s. 28)
* threat to kill (s. 30)
* threat to inflict grievous bodily harm (s. 31)
* demand with a threat to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm (s. 32 (1) (a)
* possession of a weapon with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm (s.
* kidnapping (s. 37)
* sexual assault in the first, second and third degree (s. 92A, s.
* sexual Intercourse without consent (s.92D)
* act of indecency in the first second & third degree (s.92F, s.92G, s.
* act of indecency without consent (s.92J)
* act of indecency with young persons (s.92K)
* incest (s.92L)
* abduction (s.92M)
* possession of offensive weapon (s.493)
* possession of offensive weapon with intent to commit and offence involving
violence (s.494)
* offensive behaviour (s.546A)
84. The Committee agrees with the Law Society, the Bar Association and senior
police, who have made representations on the matter,
that a definition of domestic
violence must be expressed more simply. It appears that the current complexity
is causing difficulty
for police training
and the same difficulty is likely to be experienced
by others who need to understand and work with the legislation. Additionally,
legislation should, where ever possible, be worded and structured in such a
way that it can be readily understood by everyone.
85. In Part I of this report, the Committee recommends that a consistent
definition of `domestic violence offence' should be inserted
in both the
Crimes Act 1900
Bail Act 1992
to give effect to proposed
amendments to the arrest powers and bail powers. The proposed definition merges
the current definitions
of `domestic violence offence' and `proscribed offence'
in the Domestic Violence Act. It consists of specified criminal offences
committed by a person in a specified relationship to the victim (a
of the offender; a
of the offender or of a spouse of
the offender; a
of the offender; or
a household member
of the offender), and it contains a range of new offences, namely:
* forcible confinement (s.34);
* abduction of a young person (s.36);
* destroying or damaging property (s.128);
* possession of an article with intent to destroy property (s.133);
* being found with an intent to commit an offence (s.145(1));
* aiding or abetting or being knowingly concerned in the commission of a
domestic violence
86. In Part I of this report, the Committee also recommends that there should
be an offence of stalking, and that this new offence
should be included in the
definition of `domestic violence offence'.
87. The proposed definition eliminates unnecessary detail by merging the
current definitions of `domestic violence offence' and `proscribed
offence' in
Domestic Violence Act
, and minimises the need to refer to the
by referring to all specified criminal offences by name and
section number.
88. However, as the Committee recognises in
of this report, the
definition of domestic violence for the purpose of obtaining a civil protection
order under the
Domestic Violence Act
should be different from the
definition of `domestic violence offence' for the purpose of the criminal law.
The range of conduct
or threatened conduct which should be sufficient to obtain
a protection order should be wider than conduct or threatened conduct
attracts special provisions in the
The later must be limited to alleged or proven criminal conduct.
89. Apart from the current problems with the definition of "domestic violence
offence", the focus on that concept in the first
two grounds for a protection
order appears to have influenced the interpretation of the third ground, and
consequently the
range of conduct which constitutes domestic violence in the
Domestic Violence Act
. In the absence of a definition of 'domestic violence'
Domestic Violence Act
, the Supreme Court of the ACT in the case
determined that 'domestic violence' would `usually' mean
actual or threatened violence.
The judgment states:
If a person is to be restrained by a protection order, that
person must have displayed conduct giving rise to a reasonable fear
of violence
of the kind that would constitute a threat to the safety of a relevant person.
It is not enough that they have
behaved inappropriately or even offensively
towards another. A threat to safety would usually, though not always, be constituted
by conduct, engaged in or threatened, which amounts to a 'prescribed offence'.
Each of the prescribed offences involves physical
violence being either engaged
in or threatened.
90. The Committee considers that
the range of conduct which should found the granting of a protection order is
broader than actual
or threatened violence. Removing the fear for safety
criteria from the third ground, recommended by the Committee below, only
addresses definitional issues.
91. The Committee considers that a simplified definition of 'domestic violence'
should be inserted in the legislation, and that the
definition should include
all conduct which is currently a ground for a protection order.
92. In this context the Committee notes that most, but not all of the conduct
which constitutes a `domestic violence offence' under
the proposed definition
may be summarised as follows:
* causing or threatening to cause personal injury; and
* causing or threatening to cause damage to property.
93. Subject to the 'likely to recur' requirement, the Committee notes that this
conduct constitutes grounds for a restraining order
Magistrates
and would be consistent with the combined
Domestic Violence
Magistrates Court Act
legislative scheme.
94. As noted above, the proposed definition of domestic violence for the
purpose of the
Domestic Violence Act
is discussed in detail below.
to commit a domestic violence offence
95. Under the grounds for a protection order set out in sub-sections 4(1)(a)
and (b) of the
Domestic Violence Act
, the applicant must establish that
the respondent engaged, or threatened to engage, in conduct which constituted a
domestic violence
offence, and that, if the respondent is not restrained, the
respondent is likely to commit a domestic violence offence.
96. All Australian state jurisdictions currently have similar provisions.
Proposed New Zealand Domestic Violence legislation may
apply such a provision
only to threatened behaviour. It may not apply where the respondent has committed
a domestic violence
The American Model
Code empowers the Court to grant orders for protection 'if it appears....that
domestic or family violence
has occurred'. Other than in the case of emergency
orders, where there is a requirement that the petitioner is 'in immediate danger',
there is no requirement to consider whether further domestic violence is likely
97. Under the
Family Law Act
the Court can grant an injunction for
the personal protection of a person,
is power to grant an order 'in any case in which it appears to the Court to
be just and convenient to do so'.
Magistrates Court Act
, does not apply a 'likely to recur'
requirement where the ground for the restraining order is that the respondent
has behaved in
an offensive or harassing manner. It is noted that conduct which
falls within the other grounds is likely also to be 'harassing'
and possibly
'offensive', and that it is possible to rely on multiple grounds when seeking a
restraining order. Consequently, in
a high proportion of cases under the
Magistrates Court Act
the 'likely to be repeated' criteria does not need
to be considered. This in turn means that there is a significant difference
the liberal approach authorised by the
Magistrates Court Act
the more restrictive criteria in the
Domestic Violence Act
99. Seddon notes that the 'likely further incident' element has occasionally
been a stumbling block in Australian jurisdictions
where it is included in legislation,
including South Australia
and Tasmania.
Seddon points out that if an applicant seeks an order after the first violent
incident or if there is a long interval between
incidents, the present criteria
may cause difficulty.
100. Whether conduct is likely to occur again, or a threat is likely to be
carried out, is not an issue which can be the subject
of strict objective
proof. In practical terms, it is the fact of violence or harassment or
offensive behaviour, or the threat of
violence which indicate that the victim
is at risk. Added to this is the general difficulty of attempting to predict
the respondents
behaviour. Because of the diversity of domestic violence, it is
not possible to prescribe an exhaustive list of factors which could
upon to assess the 'likely to occur' element.
101. The Committee considers that section 4 of the
Domestic Violence Act
should be amended to delete the 'likely to occur' element from section 4(1) (a)
& (b) so that proof of prior conduct would be
sufficient.
Recommendation 6:
That section 4 of the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to delete the
requirement, from sub sections 4(1)(a) and (b) that the
Court find that the
respondent is likely to engage in conduct or in further conduct that would
constitute a domestic violence offence.
102. Fear for safety is an element of section 4(1)(c) ('the offensive and
harassing conduct ground') but not the other grounds. The
question raised in
the Discussion Paper was whether the 'fear for safety' element in this ground
should be retained. Most submissions
to the Committee called for its abolition.
Recommendation
of the Australian Law Reform Commission
Domestic Violence Act
was enacted in response to recommendations
of the Australian Law Reform Commission made in 1986.
The Law Reform Commission recommended that one of the
grounds for a protection order should be that the respondent had harassed
applicant and was likely to repeat the harassment.
That is, there was no recommendation for a 'fear for
safety' requirement. The Law Reform Commission proposed that protection orders
would mirror the injunctions available under the
Family Law Act
104. The power of the Family Court to issue injunctions is wide and there is no
'fear for safety' requirement.
Family Law Act
is concerned with the personal
protection and the physical integrity of a person.
105. The Family Court has adopted a wide interpretation of the power in the
Family Law Act
to grant an injunction for `personal protection'.
106. The Law Reform Commission noted that under the
Family Law Act
married victims of domestic violence could seek an injunction for their personal
protection and for the protection of the children
of the marriage including
protection from harassment.
It noted that injunctions
were not available under the
Family Law Act
to other victims of domestic
violence. The only protection available to those not covered were "keep the
peace" orders and
civil injunctions which were in many cases inappropriate and
insufficient.
107. The Law Reform Commission proposed that like Family Court injunctions
the protection order should be capable of being tailored
to a variety of objectionable
behaviour and the Court should have a wide power to deal with physical violence
and harassment.
Legislative
108. Two legislative anomalies are immediately apparent. Firstly, offensive and
harassing conduct is a ground for a restraining order
Magistrates
, but unlike the equivalent ground in the
Domestic Violence
'fear for safety' is not required.
109. So far as is relevant section 197 of the
Magistrates Court Act
reads as follows:
"The Court may, on application and if satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that-
(c) the respondent has behaved
in an offensive or harassing manner;
make an order restraining the respondent from ....
(d) causing personal injury or damage to
(e) threatening to cause personal injury or damage to property;
(f) behaving in an offensive or harassing manner"
110. The Law
Society of the Australian Capital Territory, with the ACT Bar Association
concurring, submitted to the Committee that:
"...the distinction between Magistrate Court Act orders and
protection orders in this area is illogical and the distinction should
abolished."
111. The second legislative anomaly arises because section 10 of the
Violence Act
directs the Court to treat the need to ensure that the aggrieved
person is protected from violence or harassment as a primary consideration
determining an application for a protection order.
This is a blanket provision - it is not limited to an aggrieved person who is
in fear for their safety or the safety of a child.
112. The Committee reaffirms and adopts the objectives and the rationale of the
Law Reform Commission referred to above. Offensive
or harassing conduct should
be sufficient, as it is in the
Magistrates Court Act
, to justify the
granting of a protection order. The Committee agrees with the submission of the
Law Society of the Australian Capital
Territory that there is no logical reason
Domestic Violence Act
to be more restrictive or hesitant, in the
case of offensive or harassing conduct, than the
Magistrates Court Act
This alone, in the Committee's view is sufficient to warrant amendment of
section 4(1)(c)
to delete the 'fear for safety' requirement.
Interpretation
by the Supreme Court
113. The need to amend is reinforced by the consequences of the interpretation
of the offensive or harassing conduct ground by the
Supreme Court of the ACT in
the case of P v P.
Court held that
in order to rely on that ground, the applicant's fear must be an 'objectively
reasonable response' and it must be
a fear for physical
"It is not enough either that a subjective reaction to that effect
is aroused. It must be an objectively reasonable response.
... The purpose of
the Domestic Violence Act is to protect persons from physical violence...."Safety"
implies a freedom from
hurt, injury or danger. It relates essentially to freedom
from "domestic violence" whether physically engaged in or seriously
threatened....Other
incursions upon their well-being are able to be dealt with by Family Court orders
or, where there is no
marriage, ordinary injunctive processes.
If a person is to be restrained by a protection order, that person
must have displayed conduct giving rise to a reasonable fear
of violence of
the kind that would constitute a threat to the safety of a relevant person.
It is not enough that they have
behaved inappropriately or even offensively
towards another. A threat to safety would usually, though not always, be constituted
by conduct, engaged in or threatened, which amounts to a 'prescribed offence'.
Each of the prescribed offences involves physical
violence being either engaged
in or threatened.'
114. There are two
main implications of the interpretation that 'objectively reasonable fear' is
required. The first relates to the
effect on the combined
Domestic Violence
Magistrates Court Act
legislative scheme itself, and the second
relates to the way cases are dealt with.
115. The interpretation has emphasised and deepened the narrowness of the
protection available under the
Domestic Violence Act
compared to the
Magistrates Court Act
. Consequently, it has widened a gap which already
existed in the combined
Domestic Violence Act /
Magistrates Court Act
legislative scheme. Section 198(2) of the
Magistrates Court Act
"A person is not entitled to make an application in respect of alleged conduct
under this Part if the person is entitled to make
an application in respect of
conduct under the
Domestic Violence Act 1986
116. Consequently, where a person is entitled to apply for a protection order
by relying upon the offensive or harassing conduct
ground under the
Violence Act
, and the person asserts that they are in fear for their
safety, they must apply under the
Domestic Violence Act
rather than the
Magistrates Court Act
. If they fail to satisfy the Court that it is an
'objectively reasonable fear' it is arguable that they may not then be able to
Magistrates Court Act
where the fear for safety criteria
does not apply. This anomaly means that in some cases, and without good reason,
protection may
not be available.
117. The second effect of the interpretation is on the way cases are to be
dealt with. The 'objectively reasonable fear' test means
that the test is not
whether the aggrieved person
in fear but whether a Judge or
Magistrate finds that fear is objectively, a reasonable response to the
respondent's conduct.
118. The 'objectively reasonable fear' test introduces a level of abstraction
which has several consequences, that is:
* it shifts the focus from the respondents conduct to careful analysis of the
reasonableness of the aggrieved person reaction to
* it assumes that a detached, 'objective' approach will more adequately
identify a risk to safety compared to an honest assessment
by the aggrieved
* it 'decontextualises' the conduct, that is, it produces a tendency to assess
the respondents conduct and the impact on the victim
in isolation from factors
which are relevant to both. Relevant factors may be the history and nature of
prior violence, threats and/or
harassment and the circumstances in which it
occurred; and
* the 'objective' test may ignore the common experiences of a person in the
position of the aggrieved person and be based on fallacious
assumptions about
the likely impact of the conduct.
119. There is a risk that the outcome of applying an 'objective' test will
be a tendency to minimise and trivialise the conduct.
One of the central features
of domestic violence is the fact that it generally occurs in private and the
victim is peculiarly
vulnerable both in terms of accessibility to the perpetrator
and the consequences of undue pressure and intimidation, through
a variety of methods and tactics aimed at exerting power, and to attain or maintain
control. These tactics can include
impugning the victims reactions - that is,
that the victim is imagining things, that the victim is crazy, that the victim
vindictive, that the victim is actually the perpetrator or that the victim
is equally 'to blame'.
120. Seddon notes that the decision means that a person who is particularly
vulnerable may not be able to satisfy the criteria
even when the other party
has exploited that vulnerability.
121. Attaching the 'objectively reasonable fear' test appears to reverse the
subjective criterion stated in the legislation. The
words of the sub-section
are that 'the spouse...fears for his or her safety'.
On its the face, the relevant consideration is whether
the spouse is genuine in claiming to be in fear.
122. Lastly, the interpretation does not appear to accord with the intent
behind the legislation, which is to curb not just criminal
violence but other
forms of violence which have traditionally fallen outside of the scope of the
criminal law.
123. The judgment of the Supreme Court provides an example of an incident
which would not satisfy the criteria - "a technical
assault by means of physical
restraint accompanied by verbal abuse."
the Supreme Court said:
"Whilst, if accepted, that is conduct which ought not to be permitted,
it does not even remotely fall under the DVA (Domestic
Violence Act)."
124. If it is correct
that such behaviour does not fall under the
Domestic Violence Act
the Committee's view it should.
125. For the reasons given above, the Committee recommends that the requirement
of 'fear for safety' should be deleted from the offensive
or harassing conduct
Recommendation 7:
That the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to delete the requirement
of 'fear for safety' in the offensive and harassing conduct
Definition of `domestic violence'
126. The Committee considers that a definition of 'domestic violence' should be
inserted in the legislation to ensure that the range
of conduct covered is
clear. The definition should be as simple as possible. To that end, it should
focus on the character of the
conduct that constitutes domestic violence stated
in general terms and should be in plain English, similar to the language used
the grounds for a restraining order in
Part X of the
Magistrates Court
127. The Committee believes that all conduct which is currently a ground for a
protection order should be included in the definition,
subject to the
recommendations made above.
128. As noted above most, but not all of the conduct which constitutes a
`domestic violence offence' under the definition proposed
report may be summarised as follows:
* causing or threatening to cause personal injury; and
* causing or threatening to cause damage to property.
129. The Committee considers that it is desirable to use the summary form in
the definition of domestic violence, while also making
provision for those
domestic violence offences that do not strictly fall within the general
categories, such as forcible confinement,
abduction of a young person, and
kidnapping. This could be achieved by adding the following `catch all'
categories to the definition
of `domestic violence':
* a domestic violence offence;
* a threat to commit a domestic violence offence
130. The proposed definition of `domestic violence offence' should be fully set
Domestic Violence Act
, either in the definition, or
preferably as a schedule to the Act.
131. The Committee is of the view that the definition of domestic violence
should include such other behaviour, which if not treated
as domestic violence,
would subvert or tend to subvert the intention of the
Domestic Violence
. To that end, and as a matter ancillary to the grounds of a protection
order, the Committee recommends below that a purposes clause
and a principles
clause should be inserted in the
Domestic Violence Act
purposes and
principles of the Act.
132. Leaving aside the question of the relationship between the parties, dealt
with later in this report, the Committee considers
that for the purposes of the
Domestic Violence Act
the definition of 'domestic violence' should
* causing or threatening to cause personal injury;
* causing or threatening to cause damage to property;
* intimidating, harassing, or offensive behaviour;
* a domestic violence offence;
* a threat to commit a domestic violence offence; and
* such other behaviour, which if not treated as domestic violence would subvert
or tend to subvert the purposes and principles of
133. If this recommendation is accepted, and following on from recommendations
made above by the Committee, it would be possible
to bypass the amendments
suggested above to section 4(1) (a), (b) & (c) and replace all grounds for
an order in section 4 with
one simple ground, that is, 'that the respondent
engaged in conduct, in respect of the aggrieved person, which constitutes
violence under this Act'.
Recommendation 8:
That a definition of domestic violence should be included in the Domestic
Violence Act.
Recommendation 9:
The definition of domestic violence should include:
(i.) causing or threatening to cause personal injury;
(ii.) causing or threatening to cause damage to property;
(iii.) harassing, or offensive behaviour;
(iv.) a domestic violence offence;
(v.) a threat to commit a domestic violence offence; and
(vi.) such other behaviour, which if not treated as domestic violence would
subvert or tend to subvert the purposes and principles
of this Act.
Recommendation 11:
That consideration should be given to amending section 4 to replace the
existing grounds for a protection order with the single ground
respondent has engaged in conduct, in respect of the aggrieved person, which
constitutes domestic violence under this Act'.
matters which arise from consideration of
and principles
Domestic Violence Act
at present does not contain any statement
of the purpose of the legislation. The list of matters to be taken into account
10 guides the Court in determining individual applications for a
protection order. This is not the same as a statement of purposes
principles which would orientate the operation of the whole Act. A purposes and
principles clause would assist to resolve any
difficulties in relation to
interpretation. That is, where more than one interpretation of a particular
provision or combination
of provisions is possible, the interpretation which is
consistent with, and best advances, the purposes and principles in the Act
would prevail.
135. Proposed New Zealand domestic violence legislation contains an 'Objects'
section which commences by reciting that 'the object
of the Act is to reduce
violence in domestic relationships' and the means by which the Act attempts
to do that are listed.
136. The Committee considers that a purposes clause and a principles clause
should be inserted in the
Domestic Violence Act
. The purposes clause
should start by noting that the
Domestic Violence Act
is part of the
Australian Capital Territory's coordinated multi-agency response to domestic
violence which also involves the criminal
justice system; health, housing,
education and crisis services.
137. There has been a tendency for the
Domestic Violence Act
response or at least
response. Neither is
correct and it is important that the
Domestic Violence Act
be viewed in
context and as part of a comprehensive strategy.
138. In defining the purposes and principles to be inserted into the Domestic
Violence Act guidance can be found in the objectives
detailed in the National
Strategy on Violence Against Women formulated by the Commonwealth State National
Committee on violence
against women in October 1992. That strategy has been
endorsed by the ACT Government. The statement of purposes and principles
are consistent with that strategy.
139. The purposes and principles proposed are:-
The purpose of this Act as part of a coordinated multi-agency response
to domestic violence is to: (i) give primacy to the safety
of victims of domestic
violence; (ii) achieve a reduction in the incidence of domestic violence in
the community; (iii) achieve
more just and equitable responses by the legal
system; and (iv) to strengthen the authority of the law in its effective and
important role of influencing community attitudes and supporting social change.
Principles In seeking to achieve the purposes detailed
above the Court shall in the exercise of its jurisdiction observe the following
principles:- (i) domestic violence is behaviour by a person adopted to control
their victim which results in physical, sexual
and/or psychological damage,
forced isolation or economic deprivation;
domestic violence, whatever form it takes is unacceptable and must cease; (iii)
the safety, well being and protection
of any victim of domestic violence, including
any child affected or likely to be affected, is of primary concern; and (iv)
the protection's available under this Act must be as accessible as possible
and to that end Court processes should be as simple,
clear, quick and economical
for the parties as possible.
Recommendation
That a purpose clause and a principles clause be inserted in the Domestic
Violence Act to give effect to the purposes and principles
identified by the
of protection orders
140. Section 4 currently provides that if one of the grounds indicated in the
section are made out that the Court may make an order
restraining the
respondent from engaging in:-
'that conduct and in conduct that would constitute any domestic
violence offence and may impose one or more of the prohibitions and
specified in section 9'
141. Section 9 then lists various specific
prohibitions (for example, being on premises, being in a locality, approaching
specified distance) and a direction that the respondent is to return
specified personal property to the aggrieved person. The section
provides that
a protection order may specify conditions subject to which the respondent may
be on premises, be in a locality, or
approach or contact a person, including a
142. In order to improve the layout of the Act, the available content of a
protection order should be listed in section 9 rather
than by reference to
sections 4 and 9.
143. As a consequence of the amendments to section 4 recommended above, section
9 should include a requirement that a protection
order prohibit any form of
domestic violence.
Recommendation 12:
That sections 4 and 9 of the Domestic Violence Act should be amended so
that section 9 specifies the available content of a protection
order. Section 9
should be expressed to provide that a protection order:
(i) prohibit any form of domestic violence; and
(ii) may contain any of the prohibitions, directions or conditions
currently specified in section 9.
to be taken into account
144. Section 10 of the
Domestic Violence Act
, which is set out previously,
lists the matters to which the Court must have regard in
determining
application for a protection order, and an application for variation or revocation
of an interim or final protection order.
If the Committee's recommendation about the extension
procedure is accepted section 10 will also be relevant to those applications.
145. The words 'In determining an application for a protection order' are
confusing. If one or more of the grounds in section 4 is
satisfied, the Court
may grant a protection order. Section 10 does not deal with whether there are
grounds for an order. A central
purpose of section 10 appears to be to guide
the Court in determining how to tailor an order to meet the circumstances of
the particular
case, and specifically whether it is appropriate for the order
to contain one or more of the available prohibitions, directions and
listed in section 9. This should be made clear.
146. Further, the application before the Court may not be for a protection
order but rather for variation or revocation.
147. The Committee considers that section 10 should be amended by replacing the
words 'In determining an application for a protection
order the Court shall
have regard to the following', with the words 'In determining what order, if
any, should be made having regard
to the circumstances of the particular case
and the available prohibitions, directions and conditions listed in section 9,
shall have regard to the following'.
Recommendation 13:
Section 10 should be amended by replacing the words `In determining an
application for a protection order the Court shall have regard
following', with the words `In determining what order, if any, should be made
having regard to the circumstances of the particular
case and the available
prohibitions, directions and conditions listed in section 9, the Court shall
have regard to the following'.
148. The history of domestic violence may be relevant to the Court fully
appreciating the risk to the victim in the particular case,
and understanding
why certain behaviour is threatening, harassing or intimidating. It may also be
relevant to properly framing the
protection order.
149. There are three matters which have resulted in the Committee concluding
that the Act should be amended to ensure that the history
of domestic violence
is considered:
* Firstly, the uncertainty about whether conduct which has been relied on to
obtain a protection order can again be relied on when
seeking a further
* Secondly, the fact that there are divergent views about whether the fact that
the applicant has been granted a protection order
against the respondent in the
past is a relevant consideration; and
* Thirdly, the fact that in many instances the incident which has precipitated
the application for an order is only the most recent
incident in a history of
abuse. In some cases there is a risk of trivialisation unless the history of
violence is taken into account.
150. The Committee is mindful of the difficulties for the parties, as well as
the resource implications for the Court and relevant
services, which would flow
from lengthening hearings. However, in many cases the Court will be satisfied
on brief summary material,
and without the history of violence being taken into
account, that the orders sought by the applicant should be granted.
151. The proposed definition of domestic violence for the purpose of the
Domestic Violence Act
is discussed in detail above.
152. Noting that the power of the court to grant protection orders is
discretionary and will depend on the facts of a particular
case, and taking the
above into account, the Committee considers that the Court in determining an
application for a protection order
should have regard to;
* any history of domestic violence, including but not limited to:
* the period during which the applicant was subject to domestic violence;
* the nature and severity of the domestic violence;
* whether a previous protection order has been granted in any Australian or
foreign jurisdiction;
* details of previous orders including the grounds and circumstances which gave
rise to the order or orders; and
* if there was a breach of a previous protection order, the circumstances of
the breach or breaches.
Recommendation 14:
That section 10 of the Domestic Violence Act be amended to require the
Court in determining an application for a protection order
to have regard to
any history of domestic violence including the details and circumstances of any
previous protection order, wherever
made, and the circumstances of any breaches
of a previous order.
153. In order to ensure that section 10 is not more limited in any
respect than the parallel provisions in the
Magistrates Court Act
and following on from the Committee's recommendation
to insert a definition of domestic violence in the Act, the following adjustments
are needed:
* the reference to 'violence and harassment' in section 10(1)(a) should be
replaced by the words 'domestic violence';
* a new sub-section should be added to parallel sub section 204(1)(c) in the
Magistrates Court Act
, that is, that a matter to be taken into account
be 'the need to ensure that property is protected from damage'.
Recommendation 15:
That the reference to 'violence and harassment' in sub-section 10(1)(a)
should be replaced by the words 'domestic violence'.
Recommendation 16:
That a new sub section should be added to sub section 10(1) to require that
the Court shall have regard to 'the need to ensure that
property is protected
from damage'.
to be taken into account in relation to variation, revocation & further
154. The Committee has already dealt with the duration of interim and final
protection orders, and has amongst other things recommended
a procedure for
extension of a final protection order.
155. Variation and revocation of orders is dealt with in section 18 of the
Domestic Violence Act. It provides that in determining
the application to vary
or revoke a protection order or an interim protection order, the Court must
have regard to the matters specified
in section 10.
156. As noted above, the Committee considers that section 10 is primarily
concerned with listing the considerations which are relevant
to the Court
tailoring an order to the particular circumstances of the case. Section 10 does
not deal with whether there are grounds
for an order.
157. For reasons given above, on an application for variation, revocation or
extension of an order, it should be clear that the Court
can take into account
the complete history of domestic violence, including the details and
circumstances of any previous protection
order, wherever made, and the
circumstances of any breach of a current or previous protection order. There
must be no doubt about
the relevance of matters which have been relied upon to
obtain a previous or existing order.
158. Consequently, the Committee recommends that the provisions which deal with
how the Court determines applications for variation,
revocation or extension of
an order, should provide that, in addition to the matters specified in section
10, the Court must take
into account where relevant the complete history of
domestic violence, including the details and circumstances of any previous
order, wherever made, and the circumstances of any breach of a
current or previous protection order.
Recommendation 17:
That the Domestic Violence Act be amended to require that in determining
applications for variation, revocation or extension of
an order, the Court
shall have regard to the relevant history of domestic violence, including the
details and circumstances of any
previous protection order, wherever made, and
the circumstances of any breach of a current or previous protection order.
Custody, access and protection orders
159. Term of reference (f) requires the Committee to consider the automatic
cancellation of custody and access orders in favour of
violent offenders when
protection orders are breached and death threats have been made.
cancellation of custody and access orders
160. As noted in the Committee's Discussion Paper,
this term of reference is very similar to the recommendation
of the National Committee on Violence Against Women
that the Family Law Act be amended to provide for suspension
until further order of any custody or access orders where:
* there is a proven or alleged breach of a protection order; or
* there is a protection order, and one of the grounds upon which the order was
made was allegations of death threats in relation
to the applicant and/or the
* and a form has been filed in the Family Court setting out the occurrence of
these events.
161. Most of the submissions to the Committee which addressed term of reference
(f) identified a number of difficulties:
162. Firstly, any recommendation of this Committee to the Attorney General
of the ACT in relation to the operation of custody
and access orders would need
to be taken up at the appropriate Commonwealth-Territory/State forum and implemented
at the federal
level. Custody and access of children are matters that constitutionally
fall within federal jurisdiction, and are regulated by
Part VII of the
Law Act 1975
. Any amendment to the law which would allow a Court to cancel or
vary a custody or access order could only be effected by the
Federal Parliament,
and is outside the power of the ACT Legislative Assembly.
163. Secondly, a breach of a protection order may be serious or minor, and
the application of "automatic cancellation" would in
many cases be quite unfair
to the party formerly entitled to custody or access.
164. Thirdly, what mechanism would be required for breach of a protection
order and/or death threats to result in "automatic cancellation"
of a custody
or access order? Should those events in themselves be sufficient, or should
there be an additional requirement?
A number of submissions to the Committee
supported the recommendation of the National Committee
on Violence Against Women, outlined above, which required that a form be
in the Family Court setting out the occurrence of abuse.
165. Although the recommendation of the National Committee on Violence Against
Women was to the effect that at the time the form
was filed, "then any custody
or access order in favour of the person against whom the allegations have been
made will be suspended
until further order", it went on to also require that "a
suspension notice shall issue forthwith", and that a copy of the suspension
notice "be served personally on the party formerly entitled to custody or
access pursuant to the suspended order".
166. Fourthly, when, in terms of the status of the alleged conduct, would
breach of a protection order and/or death threats result
in "automatic cancellation"
of a custody or access order? The term of reference refers to violent "offenders".
Breach of a
protection order and death threats
are both criminal offences. The context is criminal.
Should the custody or access order be automatically cancelled at the time
the alleged conduct, at the time of charging, or when the alleged offence is
167. Inherent in the term of reference is a premise of immediate harm or danger
to both a parent and the children that are the subject
of the custody or access
order. To be effective the custody or access order would need to be cancelled
as soon as possible after
the alleged breach of the protection order and/or
death threats. To wait until the alleged offence is proven would not meet the
harm or danger to the children, because it may in fact take
considerable time for the proceedings in relation to the offence to be
determined in the criminal justice system.
168. The Committee does not favour "automatic cancellation" of custody and
access orders in favour of violent offenders when protection
breached and death threats have been made for the following reasons:
* it purports to place a priority on certain forms of conduct, and in doing so
fails to recognise the risk that may be presented
by more subtle forms of
* as breach of a protection order may be serious or minor, the application of
"automatic cancellation" would in many cases be quite
unfair to the party
formerly entitled to custody or access;
* it offends against the principles of natural justice - the person against
whom the allegations have been made would not have
the opportunity to be heard
to answer the allegations before the order is automatically cancelled, and would
have to institute
proceedings to revive the suspended order.
In the meantime the status of the order (as cancelled)
would be based on untested allegations, independent of legal regulation
Court (which was obviously necessary when the Court made the order in the first
* it would result in uncertainty in relation to the status of the order and
enforcement difficulties (in the face of the written
and sealed order issued by
a Court), unless the Court issued a cancellation notice.
169. The Committee notes that the recommendation of the National Committee
on Violence Against Women
addresses the problem
of uncertainty in relation to the status of the order and enforcement difficulties
(by requiring that
a form be filed in the Family Court, and a suspension notice
issue immediately, to be served personally on the party formerly
entitled to
custody or access pursuant to the suspended order). However, it also gives a
priority to certain forms of violence
(thereby devaluing others); its application
is arbitrary; and the concept of "automatic suspension until further order"
than cancellation) equally offends against the principles of natural
170. Further, the consequence of automatic suspension of any custody or access
order, where one of the grounds upon which a protection
order was made relates
to allegations of death threats to the applicant and/or the children, may
create a greater reluctance in the
Magistrate to exercise discretion to grant a
protection order in proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act in the first
171. The Committee believes that the approach of term of reference (f) and of
the National Committee on Violence Against Women, which
focuses on the criminal
context of the conduct of the person in whose favour a custody or access order
has been made loses sight
of the distinction between criminal processes, which
aim to hold an offender responsible for past criminal behaviour, and civil
which are primarily remedial and preventative. The focus should be
on responding to the need to meet any immediate harm or danger
within the civil
system of protection, which in the ACT is provided by both the
Family Law Act
and the Domestic Violence Act, as well as child welfare laws, and specifically
Children's Services Act
172. Currently, when a protection order is in force, and it is breached and/or
death threats have been made, an application can
be made under
Family Law Act
to either the Family Court
or Magistrates
to discharge, vary or suspend any existing
custody or access orders.
In an urgent case on an
application made ex parte, the Court may make an order until a specified time
or until further order.
173. The Committee notes that many of the submissions to the Committee
expressed dissatisfaction with the current system, and in
particular, that in
proceedings for custody and access the Family Court, has:
* failed to take into account (sufficiently, if at all) the detrimental effects
of exposure to violence on children in determining
what orders will best
promote the best interests of the child;
* ignored the existence of a protection order, and made orders inconsistent
174. It was this dissatisfaction that motivated the recommendation of the
National Committee on Violence Against Women and the support
recommendation in a number of submissions to the Committee in response to term
of reference (f). The Committee notes that
recent judgments of the Family
Court, and proposed amendments to the
Family Law Act
by the Family Law Reform
Bill are addressing that dissatisfaction.
175. Recent judgments of the Family Court have emphasised that domestic
violence is a factor of great importance in assessing the
welfare of children.
Marriage of JG and BG
, at Fam LR 263; FLC 81,318 the principles
were summarised as follows:
"1. In proceedings relating to custody guardianship and access
evidence of family violence is relevant in so far as it assists the
determining what orders will best promote the welfare of the children.
2. The court will have regard to the fact that family
violence may be directly
or indirectly relevant to children's welfare in a variety of ways, and may be
relevant even where it is
not directed at or witnessed by the children.
3. So far as the evidence allows, the court will attempt to understand the
of any family violence that has occurred and its potential effect on the
4. Where evidence permits the court to make findings
of contested allegations
of family violence, and where such findings are necessary in order to determine
what orders will promote
the child's welfare, the court will make the findings.
5. Where the court is in a position to make findings on allegations of family
violence which are relevant to the children's welfare, but does not need to do
so in order to determine what orders will promote
the welfare of the children,
it may be open to the court to refrain from making the findings. If such a
discretion exists, the court
will exercise it on the basis of a consideration
of whether the children's welfare is most likely to be promoted by making or
to make such findings."
Section 43(ca)
requires a court to have regard to the need to ensure safety from
family violence in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the
Family Law Act
Sub-sections 68F(2)(i) and (j) also require a court in determining what is in a
child's best interests to consider any family violence
and any family violence
order involving the child or a member of the child's family.

(Commonwealth) commenced on 11 June 1996.
It repealed the former

and substituted a new
- Children.
11 - Family Violence
178. Division 11 deals with the relationship between Division 11 contact orders
and Family Violence orders.
179. The definition of "contact order" in Division 11 is wide.
It provides that "a contact order", is a parenting
that deals with contact between a child and
another person or persons.
It also includes "to
the extent that it requires or authorises (expressly or impliedly) contact between
a child and another
person or persons ... any other order (however described)
made under this Act". Division 11 contact orders therefore appear to
what were referred to as custody or access orders.
180. Family violence order
means an order (including
an interim order) made under a prescribed law of a State or Territory to protect
a person from family
The Domestic Violence Act is a prescribed law.
of Division 11
181. The purposes of Division 11, set out in section 68Q, are:
* to resolve inconsistencies between Division 11 contact orders and family
violence orders;
* to ensure that Division 11 contact orders do not expose people to family
violence; and
* to respect the right of a child to have contact, on a regular basis, with
both parents where contact is diminished by the making
or variation of a family
violence order, and it is in the best interests of the child to have contact
with both parents on a regular
for contact that is inconsistent with a family violence order
182. Section 68R deals with the situation where a Court makes a contact order
that is inconsistent with a family violence order.
183. In common with the definition of a Division 11 "contact order", the definition
of a section 68R "contact order" is wide,
and specifically includes a "contact order", which
means a parenting order
that deals with contact
between a child and another person or persons;
and "to the extent that it requires or authorises (expressly
or impliedly) contact between a child and another person or persons
other order (however described) made under this Act". Section 68R contact orders
therefore also appear to include what
were referred to as custody or access
184. Section 68S confirms that the section 68R contact order prevails and
the family violence order is invalid to the extent of
the inconsistency.
185. The Court must include in the section 68R contact order a detailed explanation
of how the contact provided for in the order
is to take place, and give a copy
of the order to persons including the Registrar of the Court that made or last
family violence order, and the Commissioner of the police force of
the State or Territory in which the person protected by the
family violence
order resides.
186. An application may be made to the Court under sub-section 68S(2) for
a declaration of the extent to which the section 68R

or suspension of a contact order in the course of proceedings under the
Domestic Violence Act
187. Sub-section 69J(2) confirms the power of the Magistrates Court to exercise
Family Law Act
188. Pursuant to
section 68T
, the Magistrates Court has the power to make,
revive, vary, discharge or suspend a Division 11 contact order
in the course
of proceedings
for the making or variation of a protection order or an interim
protection order under the Domestic Violence Act.
That power is subject to the following:
* it must not be exercised unless the Magistrates Court makes or varies a
protection order or an interim protection order;
* the Magistrates Court must have regard to the purposes of Division 11 and to
the best interests of any relevant child;
* if section 68R applied to the making of a Division 11 contact order, the
Magistrates Court must not exercise the power unless it
is satisfied that it is
appropriate to do so because a person has been exposed, or is likely to be
exposed, to family violence as
a result of the operation of the order, and
having regard to the purposes of Division 11 and to the best interests of any
* if the Magistrates Court makes an interim protection order, or varies a
protection order on an interim basis, it cannot discharge
a Division 11 contact
order (but can for example suspend that order).
189. The Committee notes that as jurisdiction is conferred on the Magistrates
Court to make, revive, vary, discharge or suspend
a Division 11 contact order
in the course of proceedings
under the Domestic Violence Act, there is
no need to file a separate application to institute proceedings under Part VII
Family Law Act
, as was formerly the case. In this regard the Committee
also notes that the Magistrates Court may make, revive, vary, discharge
a Division 11 contact order on its own initiative, or on application by any
and the Court may dispense with the Rules
of Court as it thinks appropriate.
190. If the Magistrates Court makes an interim protection order, or varies a
protection order on an interim basis:
* the order making, reviving, varying, or suspending a Division 11 contact
order ceases to have effect after the interim protection
order stops being in
force, or 21 days, whichever occurs first; and
* no appeal lies from the making, reviving, varying, or suspending of a Division
11 contact order.
191. Regulation 12CC of the Family Law Regulations provides that for the
purposes of section 68T(6) where a court makes a final family
violence order or
a final order varying a family violence order, and makes, revives, varies,
discharges or suspends a Division 11
must send a sealed copy of the order to the Registrar of the Family Court for
registration
as soon as practicable.
or suspension of a contact order where no proceedings under the Domestic
Violence Act
192. As noted above, sub-section 69J confirms the power of the Magistrates
Court to exercise jurisdiction under Part VII of the
Family Law Act
193. If a protection order is in force and there is no need to vary it, an
application may be made under
Family Law Act
to either the Family
or the Magistrates Court
to make, revive, vary, discharge or suspend a "parenting
Parenting orders include what were previously
referred to as custody or access orders. In an urgent case on an application
made ex parte, the Court may make an order until a specified time or until further
violence and family violence orders relevant to the best interests of the
194. Section 65E of the
Family Law Act
that in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order a court must regard
the best interests of the child as the
paramount consideration. Unlike the former
provisions, section 68F requires the Court to consider:
* any family violence involving the child or member of the child's family;
* any family violence order that applies to the child or a member of the child's
195. The Court must also consider the need to protect the child from physical
or psychological harm caused, or that may be caused,
* being subjected or exposed to abuse, ill treatment, violence or other
behaviour; or
* being present while a third person is subjected or exposed to abuse, ill
treatment, violence or other behaviour.
196. In addition, 68J provides that if a party to proceedings is aware that a
family violence order applies to the child or member
or a member of the child's
family, that party must inform the Court. Further, section 68K provides that
the Court must, to the extent
to which it is possible to do so consistently
with the child's best interests being the paramount consideration:
* avoid making an order which is inconsistent with a family violence order;
* avoid making an order which exposes a person to family violence.
197. The Committee believes that the amendments to the
Family Law Act
a comprehensive legislative framework that meets the issues identified by term
of reference (f), and subsequently in the
submissions to the Committee. In this
regard, the Committee is encouraged by the recent judgments of the Family Court
and legislative
amendments that have emphasised that domestic violence is a
factor of great importance in assessing the welfare of children.
198. The Committee notes that the
Family Law Reform Act 1995
is consistent with
the national agreement of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in July
1994 on principles for amendments
Family Law Act 1975
State/Territory domestic violence legislation in relation to the compatibility
of access and protection orders.
199. The agreement of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General included:
* State and Territory legislation will recognise the power of the Family Court
to make a declaration setting out the manner in which
a protection order is to
operate in the light of a later access order; and
* Officers will advise on the form and practicality of having a system of
notification by one Court to another of any supervening
200. The Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act 1996
gives effect to the recommendations of the Standing
Committee of Attorneys General and effects the following amendments to the
Violence Act 1986:-
(a) Inserting a definition of `relevant family contact order' at section 3.
That definition defines a `relevant family contact order':-
"In relation to a protection order or an interim protection order, means a
Division 11 contact order within the meaning of Division
Family Law Act 1975
of the Commonwealth that relates to access between the
aggrieved person or the respondent, and any child of either of those persons"
(b) Inserting section 8A which will require the applicant for a protection
order to inform the Court of any `relevant family contact
order', or any
pending application for such an order of which the applicant is aware.
Sub-section 8A(2) further provides that a failure
to inform the Court of any
`relevant family contact order' does not affect the validity of a protection
order or an interim protection
order. In a practical sense as
section 68S(1)
provides that a protection order or interim protection order is invalid to the
extent of any inconsistency with a contact order,
it is in the interests of an
applicant to inform the Court of any contact order to enable the court to
assess the relevance and affect
of that order upon the terms of any interim
protection order or protection order it makes. It should be noted that
Family Law Act
will impose an obligation on certain persons to
inform a Court of any protection orders or interim protection orders and
section 68S(1)
Family Law Act
will enable certain persons
to apply for a declaration of the extent to which a contact order is
inconsistent with a protection order
or an interim protection order.
(c) Inserting sub-sections 10(1)(ea) and 14(2A) requiring a Court in
determining an application for a protection order or an interim
order to have regard (in addition to the other matters specified) to whether
access between the aggrieved person or the
respondent, and any child of either
of those persons, is relevant to the making of the order, and to any `relevant
family contact
order' of which the Court is aware.
In determining whether to
a protection order or interim protection
order amendments inserting sub-sections 18(4) and 18(6) will require the Court
to also have
regard to the matters specified at sub-sections 10(1)(ea) and
14(2A) as detailed above. However in determining whether to
protection order or interim protection order inserted sub-sections 18(5) and
18(7) provide that the Court is
to have regard to those matters. As
a consequence the terms of a contact order are not matters relevant to the
revocation of a protection
order or interim protection order.
(d) Substituting section 30A providing that a party to proceedings who informs
a person of the contents of an order, or a person
who informs a Court pursuant
to sub-sections 68J(1) or (2) of the
Family Law Act
of a protection order or
interim protection order, is exempt from the restrictions on publication
specified at section 30 of the
Domestic Violence Act 1986.
198. The foregoing amendments to the Domestic Violence Act 1986 commenced with
the commencement of the
Family Law Reform Act 1995
on 11 June 1996.
Supervised Child Access Services
199. When parents separate any children of the relationship live mainly with
one parent and regularly spend time with the other.
In some circumstances
difficulties with access change overs and or concern for the safety or well
being of the children or custodial
parent exist. Access hand overs can be
situations of intense conflict.
200. There are only a handful of services in Australia and New Zealand which
assist in the practical management of access. On
the other hand children's access
services have existed for some time in Canada, Britain and the USA.
201. The manner in which supervised child access services operate and the aims
of supervision depend largely on the type of cases
the centre/agency accepts.
As yet there are no agreed operational standards for children's access services
in Australia.
202. In the ACT various agencies provide children's access services. The
Salvation Army offers a hand over service and fully supervised
access service
to families. Arrangements are made for parents to arrive at different times
and in separate areas of their premises.
Supervision is provided on site and
in some circumstances at homes, parks, food outlets and a range of other places
so as to provide
a more natural access environment. The Salvation Army
independently funds the provision of these services. The Salvation Army's
services are in high demand particularly in matters involving the intervention
of the Family Court.
203. Marymead offers supervised access for children who are the subject of
Child Care Orders. The ACTIV League offers a playgroup
service allowing
intravenous drug users to have regular contact with their children in a natural
setting but under the supervision
and with the assistance of members of the
staff of the League.
204. The Federal Government's justice statement initiative
provides funding for a national pilot program of access
hand over and visiting centres, for the safe and appropriate transfer
of children
between separated parents where families are experiencing conflict or there
is a background or risk of violence,
other abuse or abduction. The pilot program
will fund one pilot centre in each capital city possibly co-located with existing
community services.
205. The need for a fully funded service for supervised access hand overs in
the ACT is great. The location of a Family Court Registry
and the size of the
`Canberra Region' it services adds to this need where people who have travelled
to Canberra require the use of
the services available in the ACT.
206. Whilst not directly within the Committees terms of reference, the
committee considers that the existence of supervised child
access services
provide effective protection in circumstances where the potential for conflict
violence or intimidation may compromise
the safety of a parent or child or
children. Whilst adequate funding for the provision of supervised child access
services is essential,
proper operational standards are equally important. The
Committee notes the establishment of the Australian and New Zealand Association
of Children's Access services whose aims are to compile and disseminate
information and develop standards relating to supervised
Children's Access
Services and to establish networks to ensure the maintenance of proper
standards and to lobby government to provide
funding. Whilst this Association
is active in the ACT the Committee also notes that the Domestic Violence
Interagency (a group of
service providers in the field of Domestic Violence)
has established a working party to examine issues relating to supervised child
access services and to lobby government at Territory and federal level for the
introduction of government funded services.
People who can be protected under the Domestic Violence
207. This chapter deals with the problems identified in the Research Paper
208. The following people may currently
for protection under
the Domestic Violence Act:
an aggrieved person, which is defined to mean a person in respect
of whom the alleged conduct has been, or is likely to be, engaged
* where the alleged conduct involves a child - a person with whom the
child normally resides; or a parent or guardian of the child;
or the child;
* a police officer.
209. The category of people who may apply is not the same as the category
of people for whose benefit a protection order may be
made under the Domestic
Violence Act. The category of people who may be
is as follows:
* a spouse, including a former spouse, de facto spouse and former de facto
spouse of the respondent;
* a child of the respondent, or a child of a spouse of the respondent;
* a relative,
or former relative of the respondent;
* a household member, which means a person who normally resides, or was
normally resident, in the same household as the respondent,
other than as a
tenant or border.
210. Those who fall outside the category of people who may be protected under
the Domestic Violence Act can make an application
for a restraining order under
Magistrates Court Act 1930
which provides virtually identical protection's
to those available under the Domestic Violence Act. The
Magistrates Court Act
provides that only those who are not entitled to make an application in respect
of conduct under the Domestic Violence Act
can apply under the
Magistrates Court
This means that in the ACT no one is precluded,
on the basis of their relationship with a respondent, from obtaining an order.
211. Consistent with the current legislative scheme, the Committee believes
that domestic violence should be distinguished politically
and conceptually
from other types of violence, and consequently a separate Domestic Violence Act
should be maintained:
* to highlight the problem of domestic violence within the community;
* to enable civil legislation and court procedures to be tailored to the relevant
group. In this context, the Committee notes
in particular, that the category
of people who may be protected under the Domestic Violence Act mirrors in all
relevant respects
the definition of "member of the family" under the Family
Law Reform Bill
, for the purpose of the definitions
of "family violence" and "family violence order", and in turn, the application
11 (which deals with the relationship between Division 11 contact orders
and Family Violence orders), and criteria relevant to
determining what is in
the best interests of the child; and,
* to facilitate certainty in the application of the criminal law, and
specifically the enhanced arrest and bail powers in relation
to domestic
violence offences, as recommended by the Committee in Part 1 of this report, by
maintaining the relationship between
the parties as the distinguishing feature
for the purpose of both the criminal law and civil proceedings under the
Domestic Violence
* for statistical purposes.
Non-cohabiting
intimate relationships
212. A report entitled
The Effectiveness of Protection Orders in Australian
commissioned by the National Committee on Violence Against Women
and released in December 1993, recommended that protection order
legislation should
be extended to cover non-cohabiting intimate relationships and homosexual relationships.
The issue to which
the recommendation related was the inability for people in
these groups to apply for protection under any legislation in several
213. Although no one in the ACT is precluded, on the basis of their relationship
with a respondent, from obtaining an order, some
difficulties do arise in cases
where the parties have, or have had, an intimate relationship. Non-spousal intimate
relationships,
whether or not such relationships include a sexual relationship,
such as boyfriend/girlfriend relationships, companionship relationships
same sex relationships, are covered if the victim is or was a
household member.
Where the parties have, or have had, an intimate relationship but lived separately,
they are not covered by the Domestic Violence
Act. Non-cohabitation allocates
Magistrates Court Act
214. A concern of service providers, identified in the Research Paper, is
that in girlfriend/boyfriend relationships it is frequently
difficult to determine
whether an application should be made under the Domestic Violence Act or Part
Magistrates Court Act
, and it is particularly difficult where the parties
are the parents of a child.
That is, it is difficult
for the applicant and/or their lawyer to predict whether a Magistrate will find,
on the facts of the
particular case, that the parties were "household members"
or, in the case of a heterosexual relationship, that the relationship
de facto relationship. This uncertainty can cause delays and the additional
complication can be stressful for the applicant.
In turn it may take some time
in court for the Magistrate to determine the issue.
215. Another possible consequence is that a person charged with breach of an
order, or aiding and abetting a breach, might defend
the charge on the basis
that the order is invalid because the Court lacked jurisdiction to make it. In
other words, the order was
made under the wrong Act.
216. A further issue identified by the researchers in reviewing in depth interviews
with Magistrates is that because of the similarity
between applications for
restraining orders involving girlfriend/boyfriend relationships and applications
under the Domestic
Violence Act, they are in general terms treated in the same
way by the Courts. The similarity arises because many applications
for restraining
orders involving girlfriend/boyfriend relationships are sought at the time of
separation or when the relationships
Accordingly,
such applications have a context similar to applications involving marital and
de facto relationships under the
Domestic Violence Act. The Committee considers
that the same could equally be said of other intimate relationships.
217. On the other hand, the Research Paper reports the view of one Magistrate:
"...if you're looking at restraining orders in relation to relationships
break up etc then it usually has to be a fairly uncomplicated
relationship or
at an early stage of a relationship if there's not the domestic violence qualification,
namely a de facto relationship
as man and wife..."
218. In this context, the Research Paper reports that it has been estimated that
at least one third of restraining order applications
under Part X of the
Magistrates
involve girlfriend/boyfriend relationships, with the remainder involving
neighbours, children at school, and other non-intimate
relationships.
Obviously these non-intimate relationships do not
share a context similar to applications involving marital and de facto relationships
under the Domestic Violence Act.
219. Given no one is precluded, on the basis of their relationship with a
respondent, from obtaining an order, the question is not
whether people who
are, or were, in a non-cohabiting intimate relationship should be able to apply
for protection. The question is
whether they should be able to apply under the
Domestic Violence Act.
those who can be protected under the Domestic Violence Act should include
people in non-cohabiting intimate relationships
220. It may be argued that extending the category of people who can be
protected under the Domestic Violence Act to people who are,
or were, in a
non-cohabiting intimate relationships would resolve uncertainty as to whether
people in non-cohabiting intimate relationships
should apply for protection
under the Domestic Violence Act or Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
would thereby avoid delays, and overcome the loophole whereby the validity of
the order can be impugned if it is made under the
wrong Act. This argument
assumes that the concept of "intimate relationship" is relatively clear cut.
221. A counter argument is rather than resolving uncertainty, the definitional
problems with the concept of "intimate relationship"
would exacerbate problems
relating to the practical application of both the civil and criminal law, in
the context of domestic violence.
222. The term "intimate relationship" is wide and would be extremely difficult
to define with precision. This is made clear in a
number of judgements of the
New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal on the admissibility of evidence of a
"recent/existing relationship"
in sexual offence proceedings under section 409B
(3) (b) of the
Crimes Act, 1900
the Court said:
"[i]t is true that the word `relationship' is sometimes used with
almost deliberate obscurity, and that its function is frequently
obfuscation rather than clarification..."
223. Nevertheless, the
Court held that "relationship" meant "an emotional connection between two
people, sometimes involving a sexual
relations".
224. In another appeal one year later heard by a differently constituted bench,
the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held
"if the evidence were to disclose a reasonably regular sexual liaison
between the parties, which was still current or recent at
the time of the alleged
offence, then...this would constitute a relationship under paragraph 3 (b).
It would be immaterial
that there was little or no emotional involvement between
the parties...It would be unwise to attempt to define `relationship'...too
closely...[T]here
must be a degree of latitude to enable judges to meet the particular exigencies
of a particular case".
225. Therefore, intimate
relationships could include close companionship relationships, not limited to
relationships between those
of a particular age or sex, and include
relationships which do not involve a sexual relationship.
226. To limit extension of the category of people who can be protected under
the Domestic Violence Act to people who are, or were,
in a girlfriend/boyfriend
relationship or a same sex relationship would be arbitrary. In any case it is
noted that terms
, for example, are
imprecise and would carry the same, inherent difficulties with definition.
227. At least under the current legislative scheme the benchmark exists of
whether or not persons in an intimate relationship cohabited.
228. It may be argued that extending the category of people who can be
protected under the Domestic Violence Act to people who are,
or were, in a
non-cohabiting intimate relationships would not dilute the focus of the Act
because the characteristics which distinguish
the group covered by the Domestic
Violence Act, such as the likelihood of emotional factors in the relationship
or former relationship,
the likely accessibility of the applicant to the
respondent, and the use of both of these to exert power and control, are
to the dynamics in many non-cohabiting intimate relationships where
protection is sought.
229. Counter to that argument is that in many cases the likelihood that
emotional factors in the relationship or former relationship,
and perhaps more
importantly, the likely accessibility of the applicant to the respondent, are
much less in non-cohabiting intimate
relationships than where the parties live,
or have lived under the same roof.
230. Further, the current category of people who can be protected under the
Domestic Violence Act is broader than spousal or parent/child
relationships,
and includes relatives and former relatives and household members. The focus of
the Domestic Violence Act is the protection
of persons who fall within an
extended concept of family. In that respect the addition of non-cohabiting
intimate relationships to
the class of people who may be protected would dilute
the focus of the Act.
231. Consistent with that focus, and as noted above, the category of people
who can be protected under the Domestic Violence Act
mirrors in all relevant
respects the definition of "member of the family" under the
Family Law Act
, for the purpose of the definitions of "family violence"
and "family violence order". In turn, the Domestic Violence Act as it
facilitates the application the
Family Law Act
, and in particular, Division
11 (which deals with the relationship between Division 11 contact orders and
Family Violence orders),
and criteria relevant to determining what is in the
best interests of the child. Extending the category of people who can be protected
under the Domestic Violence Act to include `a person with whom the respondent
has had an intimate relationship' would create
anomalies with the
and result in problems with its application in the context of domestic violence
in the ACT.
232. Most importantly, extending the category of people who can be protected
under the Domestic Violence Act to people who are, or
were, in a non-cohabiting
intimate relationships, with the attendant definitional difficulties, would
create significant problems
with the application of the criminal law, and
specifically the enhanced arrest and bail powers in relation to domestic
violence offences,
as recommended by the Committee in Part 1 of this report.
233. While training for police and other workers must deals with the nature and
characteristics of the violence, domestic violence,
and the consequences for
the victim (and in that regard it may be difficult to distinguish many
non-cohabiting intimate relationships),
it must focus on the practical
application of the law, which in the context of domestic violence is based on
the relationship between
the parties. Consequently, the relationship between
the parties for the purpose of both domestic violence offences in the criminal
law, and civil proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act must be expressed
as precisely as possible.
234. For the reasons given above the Committee does not considers that it is
desirable for the category of people who can be protected
under the Domestic
Violence Act to be extended to include `a person with whom the respondent has
had an intimate relationship'.
made under the wrong Act in the combined Domestic Violence Act/Magistrates
Court Act legislative scheme
235. The Committee notes that the loophole whereby the validity of the order
can be impugned if it is made under the Domestic Violence
Act where, because of
the relationship between the parties, it should have been made under the
Magistrates Court Act
, and vice versa remains. This is a loophole because the
Court always has jurisdiction under one or other of the Acts regardless of
relationship of the parties.
236. To overcome the problem, the Committee considers that the Domestic
Violence Act and the
Magistrates Court Act
should each be amended to insert a
provision deeming an order made under the wrong Act to be valid where it could
have been made
under the other Act. In the case of the Domestic Violence Act,
for example, the provision should be to the effect, that an order
the Act shall not be invalid or unenforceable by reason of the fact that the
Court lacked jurisdiction to make the order
under that Act where the order
would have been valid and enforceable had it been made under the
Magistrates
Recommendation 18:
That the Domestic Violence Act and the
Magistrates Court Act
should each be
amended to insert a provision to the effect, that an order made under the Act
shall not be invalid or unenforceable
by reason of the fact that the Court
lacked jurisdiction to make the order under that Act where the order would have
been valid and
enforceable had it been made under the other Act.
The Community Advocate As Applicant
237. This chapter deals with making the Domestic Violence Act more accessible
for people who are unlikely to obtain protection without
special assistance.
238. Under the Community Advocate Act 1991, a function of the Community Advocate
is to promote the protection of people who have
a disability from abuse and
exploitation,
and to protect their rights. The
Community Advocate Act defines "disability" as any of the following conditions:
* legal disability due to age;
* a physical, mental, psychological or intellectual condition;
* a condition which would render a person a forensic patient; which gives
rise to need for protection from abuse, exploitation
or neglect.
239. The Community Advocate can "do all things necessary or convenient to
be done in connection with the performance of his or
her functions."
This means that if the Community Advocate were permitted
by the Domestic Violence Act to do so, the Community Advocate could apply
a protection order on behalf of a person who has a disability as defined by
the Community Advocate Act.
240. However, section 5 of the Domestic Violence Act limits those who can make
an application for a protection order to an aggrieved
person; a police officer;
and, where the alleged conduct involves a child, a person with whom the child
normally resides; a parent
or guardian of the child; or, the child.
241. The joint submission to the Committee of the Domestic Violence Crisis
Service, ACT Corrective Services and Marriage Guidance
Canberra and Regions,
recommended that the Community Advocate be empowered to act as applicant for a
protection order, or an application
for a restraining order under Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
, on behalf of those who are unable to represent
themselves. The submission stated:
"It is the experience of DVCS that several people from the above
mentioned categories are currently living in unsupported accommodation
subject to abuse and violence by other household members. It is considered that
these people are unable to represent themselves
in seeking protection from the
Court and it also appears that the police are reluctant to enact their powers
as applicants."
242. The Committee considers that in such cases
it is more appropriate for the Community Advocate, rather than the police, to
applicant. The case is more likely to come to the Community's Advocates
notice in the first instance. The Community Advocate is likely
to take a more
holistic approach, and the specialist resources of the Community Advocate are
suited to this type of work.
243. The Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act regulates the procedure
for applications under the Domestic Violence Act,
subject to section 8 of the
Domestic Violence Act which modifies some provisions.
This is discussed in detail below in the Chapter headed
"Hearing of Application".
244. As relevant, Part XI of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act
deals with persons under disability as a party to
proceedings.
Under the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act
a "person under a disability" means a person who has not attained full age,
or a person who is of unsound mind or incapable.
245. The application of Part XI of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction)
Act is mitigated in relation to children by section
7A of the Domestic Violence
Act. That section provides that the Court can order that a child be separately
represented where an application
for a protection order is made by a child, and
the child is not separately represented. However, the application of Part XI of
Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act remains relevant in all other
cases where a party to proceedings is a person under a disability,
where the child is the applicant and the Court does not make an order under
section 7A.
246. Part XI of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act provides for the
appointment of a `next friend' (to act on behalf
of an applicant), or a
`guardian ad litem' (to act on behalf of a respondent). Although those
proceedings are considered relatively
effective, a distinction remains between
the function of a next friend or guardian in representing a `person under a
disability'(what
they want), and the best interests advocacy inherent in the
role and function of the Community Advocate (what is in their best interests
similar to the role of the Community Advocate in proceedings under the
Children's Services Act
247. The Committee considers that the capacity of the Community Advocate to
institute proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act
(and thereby become a
party to the proceedings) would expedite the commencement of proceedings (by
avoiding the procedure necessary
to be appointed a next friend or guardian),
and preserve her best interests advocacy role. For similar reasons and to
enhance access
to protection for all persons the Committee considers that any
person should be able to institute proceedings on behalf of another
person with
the leave of the Court. This procedure would be similar to
Children's Services Act
which enables any person to apply for a child care
order with the leave of the Court.
248. A further consequential amendment to the Domestic Violence Act will be
necessary, deeming the person for whom protection
is sought to be a party to
the proceedings, in the same way as such persons are deemed to be a party to
proceedings instituted
by a police officer.
is necessary to enable representation of the interests of a person under a disability.
249. To ensure uniformity the provisions of Part X of the Magistrates Court
1930 should also be amended enabling the Community Advocate
application for a protection order on behalf of a person who has a
disability.
Recommendation 19:
That section 5 of the Domestic Violence Act and section 198 of the MCA
should be amended:
(i) to add the Community Advocate to the list of those who can make an
application under the Act. The Community Advocate should be
able to apply on
behalf of a 'person who has a disability' as defined in the Community Advocate
Act 1991; and
(ii)to enable any person with the leave of the Court to make an application
for a protection order on behalf of any person.
Recommendation 20:
That section 7 of the Domestic Violence Act and section 200 of the MCA be
amended to specify that where the applicant is the Community
Advocate, or any
other person to whom leave has been granted, the person for whom protection is
sought shall be a party to proceedings.
6.Notification of child abuse
250. This chapter deals with proposed amendments to the Domestic Violence Act
and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
to ensure the protection of a child
named in an application for a protection order by requiring notification to,
and providing a
mechanism for intervention by, the Community Advocate and the
Director of Family Services in appropriate circumstances.
251. The combined effect of sections 5 and 7 of the Domestic Violence Act is
that a child is only a party to proceedings where either
the child or a police
officer apply for an order. As a result, in all other cases where a child is
named in an application by either
a parent or guardian, or a person with whom
the child normally resides, the child's interests are represented by that
252. An issues paper relating to the proposed review of the
Services Act 1986
states that the Act
is generally regarded as not sufficiently broad to meet the needs of children
in need of care, and in particular
notes that it does not deal with matters
relating to the protection of children. It notes that the current position is
separate proceedings for the protection of children, as distinct from other
matters relating to the care of children, must be
instituted under the Domestic
Violence Act and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
, and as a consequence:
* Where a child's custodian seeks a protection order issues relating to the
welfare and protection of children are considered without
any independent
representation of what is in the best interests of the child;
* Protective proceedings in which children are or may be effected are
considered in the absence of any involvement from the welfare
system and in
ignorance of any action taken in response to the child's needs;
* Protective proceedings involving a child's custodian focus on the rights and
interests of the parties and do not necessarily or
effectively respond to the
child's rights interests or needs. The child's rights , interests or needs are
however responded to by
the immediate protection which can be provided by a
protection order.
253. The issues paper proposes amendments to the Domestic Violence Act and Part
Magistrates Court Act
* requiring the Registrar of the Court to notify the Community Advocate and the
Director of Family Services of any proceedings relating
to or concerning a
* conferring on the Community Advocate and the Director of Family Services the
capacity to appear and be heard, and to make submissions
in any proceedings
relating to or concerning a child by filing a notice of appearance.
254. This proposal:
* is predicated on the need for adequate protection for a child who has, or is
likely to be, exposed to domestic violence. It aims
is to ensure that the
interests of the child, as distinct from the interests of their carers or other
people with whom the child
has contact, are considered;
* envisages the need for an holistic approach to matters relating to the care
and control of a child. It means that matters of care
and protection of a child
can be considered simultaneously;
* is complemented by a proposed amendment to the
Children's Services Act
enable a child to be declared in need of care "if the persons responsible for
the care of the child have engaged in, or are likely
to engage in, behaviour
that is, or is likely to be, harmful to the child."
255. The Committee notes that this proposal is consistent with the provisions
Family Law Act
relating to notification of child abuse by a member Court
personnel. The provisions re-enforce and prescribe the existing obligations
Court personnel to notify in appropriate circumstances.
256. Sub-section 67ZA(2) of the
Family Law Act
requires a member of court
staff, a family and child counsellor or a family and child mediator who has in
the course of his or her
work reasonable grounds for suspecting that a child
has been abused or is at risk of being abused to notify a prescribed welfare
authority. Abuse is defined in
section 60D
Family Law Act
to include an
assault (including but not limited to a sexual assault) which is an offence, or
child sexual abuse.
257. By sub-section 67ZA(3) of the
Family Law Act
such notification is not
mandatory, but permitted in a wider category of cases, and specifically, where
a member of the staff of
the court, a family and child counsellor or a family
and child mediator has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a child has been
ill treated or is at risk of being ill treated, or has been exposed or
subjected, or is at risk of being exposed or subjected to
behaviour which
psychologically harms the child.
258. In addition,
section 67Z(2)
Family Law Act
requires a party who
alleges child abuse or a risk of child abuse to file a notice in Court. Under
sub-section 67Z(3) the Registrar
must then notify a prescribed welfare
259. Pursuant to
section 67ZB
Family Law Act
, a member of Court staff, a
family and child counsellor or a family and child mediator who gives notice
under sub-section 67Z or
67ZA of the
Family Law Act
is protected against civil
and criminal liability, and is not to be considered to have breached
professional ethics. There is equivalent
protection for members who elect to
notify "in good faith." In each case members do not breach confidentially
created by law "or
anything else".
260. The Committee notes that the
Family Law Act
is concerned with many aspects
relating to the care, welfare and development of a child, ranging from matters
of welfare residence,
responsibility for a child. By contrast, the Domestic Violence Act is
specifically
focused to provide protection.
261. Consequently, the Committee considers that unlike many proceedings under
Family Law Act
, proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act that relate to
or concern a child by definition form a basis for notification. The Committee
therefore does not believe that a two tiered approach of required notification
of proscribed conduct, on the one hand, and an election
to notify in respect of
other forms of conduct, on the other, is appropriate to the Domestic Violence
262. Instead, the Committee endorses the proposed amendments to the Domestic
Violence Act and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
requiring the Registrar of
the Court to notify the Community Advocate and the Director of Family Services
of proceedings relating
to or concerning a child in certain circumstances.
263. The Committee does not consider it necessary for the Domestic Violence
Act, or Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
to prescribe the form of
notification. It should be able to be made orally (for example, by a telephone
call) or in writing. In this
regard the Committee notes that brief details
would be included on the application for the order. The notification should be
"as soon as practicable."
264. Consistent with the
Family Law Act
, the Committee believes that the
Domestic Violence Act, and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
should contain
provisions that specifically provide that the Registrar.
* must notify in spite of any confidentially created by law "or anything
* is protected against civil and criminal liability, and is not to be
considered to have breached professional ethics in respect
notification.
265. The potential for adverse resource consequences and unnecessary invasive
intervention are mitigated by the second leg of the
proposal, which
contemplates a discretionary and selective intervention by the Community
Advocate and/or the Director of Family
Services in response to a notification
by the Registrar. Notwithstanding the discretionary nature of any intervention
the Committee
is concerned that the potential for such intervention should not
discourage or deter any application for protection. The potential
to deter an
applicant by requiring notification in all cases involving children is of such
importance that the obligation to notify
should be defined and clarified whilst
not detracting from the ordinary obligation to notify in appropriate
circumstances. The Committee
considers that notification should only be
required where the protection afforded to a child/children is likely to be
compromised
ie. when an order is sought to be revoked or varied. As a
consequence the Committee recommends that the Court or the Registrar be
required to notify the Director of Family Services and the Community Advocate
in circumstances where it or they consider that the
variation or revocation of
an order may effect the protection of a child or children.
266. The exercise of discretion by the Community Advocate and the Director of
Family Services is, however problematic. As noted
above perceptions about the
appropriateness of any notification and resulting intervention may deter
potential applicants for protection
orders. The Committee believes that these
perceptions could be further allayed by each agency developing clear and
concise guidelines
as to the basis upon which an appearance will be entered and
the consequences of any involvement. These guidelines should be made
267. Similarly, lawyers advising applicants would be placed in a difficult
position both in terms of advising a client of the consequences
institution of proceedings and in particular of varying or revoking an order
and in fulfilling their duty to notify where
a child is in need of care and
protection (which arguably exists, either because the child is not the client
and therefore legal
professional privilege does not attach to information about
the child, or because of the qualifications on legal professional privilege
created by a duty to notify conduct that may constitute a criminal offence).
268. Whilst this concern would be met to some extent by guidelines developed by
the Community Advocate and the Director of Family
Services, the restrictive
obligations of a lawyer to their client, and any children of the client,
require clarification and guidance.
In this regard, the ACT Law Society should
develop guidelines to assist legal practitioners as to how to respond to their
their client as well as their duty to notify matters relating to the
care and protection of a child.
269. The Committee believes that this proposal, together with the capacity of
the Court to order separate representation for a child
who applies for a
protection order and the recommendation made above, that the Community Advocate
should be able to apply for a protection
order on behalf of a 'person who has
a disability', appropriately respond to the need to recognise the interests of
the child by
providing mechanisms for proper protection.
Recommendation 21:
That the Committee endorses the proposed amendments to the Domestic
Violence Act and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
requiring the Court or the
Registrar of the Court to notify the Community Advocate and the Director of
Family Services of any circumstances
where it or they consider that the
variation or revocation of an order may compromise the protection of a child or
children proceedings
relating to or concerning a child.
Recommendation 22:
That the Committee endorses the proposed amendment to the
Services Act
- (i) extending the criteria to enable by which a child may be
deemed in need of care by providing that - "a child is in need of
care if the
persons responsible for the care of the child have engaged in, or are likely to
engage in, behaviour that is, or is likely
to be, harmful to the child,"; and
(ii) focusing the
Children's Services Act
to consider matters relating to
the protection of a child in addition to matters relating to the care of a
Recommendation 23:
That the Domestic Violence Act, and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act
should contain provisions that specifically provide that:
(i) The Registrar in effecting any notification does not offend any
confidentially created by law "or anything else"; and
(ii) That the Registrar is protected against civil and criminal liability,
and is not to be considered to have breached professional
ethics in respect of
that notification.
Recommendation 24:
That the Community Advocate and the Director of Family Services should
develop clear and concise guidelines as to the basis upon
which an appearance
will be entered in proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act and Part X of
Magistrates Court Act
, and the consequences of any involvement.
Recommendation 25:
That the ACT Law Society should develop guidelines to assist legal
practitioners as to how to respond to their duty to their client
and their duty
to notify matters relating to the care and protection of a child.
Consent Orders Made In Chambers
270. This chapter deals with enforcement difficulties which result from present
procedures in relation to protection orders made
by a Magistrate in Chambers
with the consent of the parties but in their absence.
271. For an interim or final protection order and any variation of an order to
be enforceable, the respondent must have been either
present when the order was
made or, personally served with a copy of the order.
272. In practice, if both parties are present at the Conference convened by
the Deputy Registrar and they consent to an interim
or final protection order,
or a variation of an existing order, the Deputy Registrar notes the agreement
of the parties on
the Court file. The Practice Direction issued by the Court
relating to Conferences by the Registrar, at Clause II, (see appendix
B) requires
the Registrar wherever possible to ensure that where agreement is reached the
consent is endorsed on the draft
form of order. As a matter of practice consent
arrangements are endorsed in writing by the parties. The Magistrates Court (Civil
in Chambers.
In effect, after the Conference,
and in the absence of the parties, the Magistrate makes the order to which the
parties consented.
273. The Senior Deputy Registrar then arranges for the order to be formally
drawn up. The typed version of the order states that
it was made by the Magistrate
in Chambers and 'in the absence of the parties'. The Senior Deputy Registrar
arranges for the
order to be served personally on the respondent.
The time it takes for the order to be executed, drawn
up and issued depends on the workload of the Magistrate and the Court staff
that day. In most cases, by the time the order is made by the Magistrate in
Chambers, drawn up and issued, the respondent will
have left the Court.
274. The problems that result from this procedure are:
* the order is not enforceable until the respondent is personally served;
* despite the fact that the respondent consented to the order, and was present
at Court (but not before the Court), the police must
personally serve the
respondent to ensure that the order is enforceable - this obviously uses
resources which could be put to better
* the endorsement of 'in the absence of the parties' is confusing for police
and reduces police effectiveness. The issue here is
that the endorsement is
also used for orders made on an undefended basis. That is, where the respondent
was served with the relevant
application but did not attend at or before the
Court. Where police are called to a further incident knowing that an order has
made, but not knowing whether the respondent was in fact present and
consented, it is more difficult for police to confront the respondent.
275. Additionally, the parties and police often assume, incorrectly, that the
order was actually made by the Senior Deputy Registrar
at the Conference and
this can lead to further confusion.
276. The current situation obviously has to be remedied. The Committee
considers that there are two options. That is:
the respondent wait at Court until the order has been
277. The respondent can be asked to wait but cannot be required to wait at the
Court. This option would involve a major reorganisation
of the Court's work
allocation. Currently, Magistrates make orders by consent in Chambers as they
become available to do so. A Magistrate
may not be available for hours.
or Deputy Registrar to have power to make orders by
278. The Registrar and Deputy Registrars
have jurisdiction
pursuant to section 405 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act to exercise
the power of the Court
under the Domestic Violence Act to make an order by consent
except where:
* the applicant or the respondent is a person under a disability; and/or
* any other person required to comply with the order or who will be affected by
the order is a person under a disability.
279. As noted above, 'person under a disability' means a person who is under
18 or a person who is of unsound mind or otherwise
The most common 'person under a disability' dealt
with under the Domestic Violence Act is a child. The Registrar or Deputy Registrars
does not have the power to make an order where the applicant is a child, or
where the order granted to an adult applicant also
names a child.
280. As a matter of practice, all consent orders are made by a Magistrate in
Chambers rather than by the Registrar or Deputy Registrars
exercising the power
of the Court.
281. There is one Registrar of the Magistrates Court, and several Deputy
Registrars, three of whom are locally designated as Senior
Deputy Registrars.
One of the Deputy Registrars convenes the Conference relating to applications
under the Domestic Violence Act.
282. The Committee considers that the most appropriate solution to the problem
is that the Registrar and, such of the Deputy Registrars
as are approved by the
Chief Magistrate, should have the power to make an interim or final protection
order where the relevant officer
convenes the Conference, and the order is to
be made with the consent of the parties, for the following reasons:
* the Court already relies almost entirely on the expertise of the Deputy
Registrars in relation to the framing of orders to be made
by consent following
a Conference. The Committee is not aware of a case where a Magistrate in
Chambers has declined to make an order
in these circumstances.
* the fact that the Conference is confidential means that the Deputy Registrar
can explore issues with the parties and their legal
representatives that may
not come out in Court. This in turn should contribute to the durability of
orders made by consent and it
should contribute to compliance.
* if orders are made by the Deputy Registrar there will be a significant saving
in the time taken to process the order; the order
will be immediately
enforceable because the respondent is present at the time the order was made;
the need for personal service by
the police will be avoided; and, Magistrates
will be relieved of their role. Additionally, as the order would be endorsed as
been made "in the presence of the parties" difficulties for police, as
set out above, will be overcome.
283. The Committee notes that whilst caution should be exercised in conferring
judicial functions on non-judicial officers, the conferral
of such functions in
relation to uncontested matters is appropriate. The exercise of any power by
non-judicial officers should be
subject to supervision by the Court.
Accordingly the conferral of any such authority should be at the discretion of
the Chief Magistrate
to appropriately qualified and experienced Court personnel
on such terms and conditions as may be appropriate.
Recommendation 26:
That the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to provide that the Chief
Magistrate may authorise the Registrar and such Deputy
Registrars as is
appropriate or necessary to make any orders consented to by the parties.
284. This does not mean that the Registrar or the Deputy Registrar
use the power in a particular case. The Committee would expect that
there would be cases where it would be prudent for the matter
to be referred
before a Magistrate, even when the parties are consenting.
The exercise of any power of the Court by the Registrar
or a Deputy Registrar as noted is subject to supervision by the Court.
285. However, for the Registrar or a Deputy Registrar to be authorised to
exercise the power to make orders by consent, the Committee
considers that
legal qualifications are highly desirable. This is because the orders must
conform with the legislation and be readily
understood. The Conferences
generally involve a lawyer for one or both of the parties and there are
frequently related issues involving
other areas of the law.
286. The Registrar or a Deputy Registrar authorised to make orders consented to
by the parties would be required to comply with any
obligations imposed upon
the Court such as explaining the proposed order and the consequences of any
breach of that order to the
respondent, the applicant and, where the applicant
is a child, the person who has the care and control of that child if he or she
is at Court. The Committee notes and commends the current practice of the
Deputy Registrars which is to give such explanations.
Recommendation 27:
In determining whether to authorise the Registrar or a Deputy Registrar to
make orders consented to by the parties formal legal qualifications
considered to be highly desirable.
Uncontested Variation or Revocation Of
287. The Research Paper found that between 1989 to 1991, 16 percent of protection
orders were varied and 12 percent were revoked
before their term was completed.
Half of those were revoked within three months of the order being granted.
Apart from cases where the applicant for revocation has not appeared at Court,
the Committee is not aware of any uncontested application
for variation or revocation
which has not been granted.
288. Either party to the proceedings in which a protection order or interim
protection order was made may apply to the Court at
any time to vary or revoke
In determining an application, including
an application where the parties are consenting, the Court must have regard
list of factors in section 10. The Committee has already made recommendations
to ensure that any history
of domestic violence, including the details and circumstances of any previous
protection order and
the circumstances of any breach of a current or previous
protection order can be considered on an application for variation or
revocation.
289. Where the applicant has an interim protection order, the order is
expressed to continue until a particular day. If the applicant
does not seek to
extend the order it lapses. In this situation, if the applicant or the
applicant's lawyer does not appear to seek
a continuation of the order, the
application is treated as having been withdrawn, and is consequently dismissed.
Alternatively, the
applicant, or the applicant's lawyer appears and indicates
that no continuation is sought and the same result follows.
290. If the applicant appears at Court and is represented the Deputy Registrar
seeks to ensure through consultation with the applicant
and the applicant's
lawyer that the applicant has freely decided to withdraw the application. If
the Deputy Registrar has any concern
the matter goes before a Magistrate.
291. Until recently, the practice in relation to an uncontested application for
revocation was that the application was listed for
a Conference conducted by a
Deputy Registrar. If the parties were present and consented to the application
the Deputy Registrar would
note the agreement on the Court file and the parties
would sign the Court file. A Magistrate would then make the order to which the
parties consented later that day in Chambers and in the absence of the parties.
This was also the usual practice where a respondent
had been served with the
application for revocation but failed to appear at Court.
292. Recently, the practice has been varied. It appears that now all
applications for revocation of a final protection order, including
applications
which are uncontested and applications where the respondent is consenting, go
before a Magistrate. This is in accordance
with the fact that section 18
requires the Court to have regard to the matters listed in section 10 in
relation to applications for
variation or revocation. The procedure also
attempts to ensure that the person who was granted the protection order is
freely seeking
a revocation and has not been pressured or coerced into making
the application.
293. The procedure for revocation must strike an appropriate balance between
being a quick and easy procedure, and the desirability
of ensuring that the
application is not a result of the respondent having breached the order or
otherwise pressured the protected
294. Some of the submissions to the Committee pointed to the number of
applications for revocation as an indication that the system
is being abused.
It does not, however, follow that this is the case. At the time an order is
granted the applicant is specifically
told by the Court that if there is to be
a reconciliation, or if the parties wish to have more contact than is allowed
by the order,
the order must be revoked or varied, (for example, by deleting or
modifying prohibitions or conditions imposed in relation to approaching,
strictly comply with the terms of the order will result
in a contravention of
the order, and the respondent may be charged with breaching the order and the
applicant charged with aiding
and abetting the breach.
295. The Committee does not think that it is necessary or desirable for all
variation or revocation cases to be automatically referred
to a Magistrate.
Some variations are non-contentious, plainly necessary and do not raise
concerns about coercion. Similarly, some
applications for revocation are
straightforward. Waiting time and pressure on each of the parties can be
reduced, and Court resources
can be saved if an appropriate screening
arrangement is applied.
296. The Committee considers that the powers of the Registrar and the
authorised Deputy Registrars, referred to above, should be
enlarged to
authorise the relevant officer to make an order for variation or revocation,
with the consent of the parties, and where
an application is uncontested,
provided that the matters listed in section 10 of the Act are considered and
the relevant officer
considers it appropriate to do so. If there is any doubt
the matter should be referred to a Magistrate. As noted above the exercise
any such authority by the Registrar or a Deputy Registrar is subject to
supervision by the Court.
Recommendation 28:
That the powers of the Registrar and Deputy Registrars, authorised by the
Chief Magistrate to make orders consented to by the parties
should include the
(i) orders for the variation or revocation, of an order with the consent
of the parties (subject to the conditions listed above);
(ii) orders where an application for variation or revocation is
uncontested;
provided that matters listed in section 10 of the Act are considered and
the relevant officer considers it appropriate to do so.
If there is any doubt the matter should be referred to a Magistrate.
297. The Committee has been informed that Magistrates tend to approach
uncontested applications for variation or revocation in different
Committee considers that a reasonable degree of standardisation would be
desirable, especially in terms of emphasising
the need to ensure that the
protected person:
* firstly, has freely decided to make the application, and has not been
pressured or coerced; and
* secondly, is aware that a further application can be made should the need
298. The Committee notes existing practices which recognise these criterion.
To ensure proper supervision of the Registrar and Deputy
Registrars authorised
to make consent orders the Committee suggests that the Court consider the issue
of practice directions detailing
the way in which the Court deals with
uncontested applications for the variation or revocation of orders reinforcing
the criteria
identified.
Recommendation 29:
That the Court should consider issuing a practice direction aimed at
ensuring a reasonable degree of standardisation in the way the
Court deals with
applications for variation and revocation that are made by consent or
uncontested. The practice direction should
emphasise the need to ensure that
the protected person has freely decided to make the application, and has not
been pressured or
coerced, and that the protected person is aware that a
further application can be made should the need arise.
Ex-Parte Interim Variation of Orders
299. The Domestic Violence Act does not provide for variation of a protection
order or an interim protection order unless the respondent
has been served with
the application for variation or revocation.
300. However, where incidents which constitute grounds for a protection order
occur after a protection order or interim protection
order is made, there may
be a greater risk to the safety of the victim than was contemplated in the
original application and by the
terms of the original order.
301. The Committee considers that the Court should have power to strengthen a
protection order where it is necessary to ensure the
safety of the applicant or
a child named in a protection order.
302. The Committee considers that due process necessitates that the applicant
for interim variation of an order be required to give
evidence on oath in
support of the application.
303. The Committee notes that the proposal for interim variation of protection
orders and interim protection orders mirrors provisions
in the Domestic
Violence Act allowing the Court to make interim protection orders.
Recommendations 30:
The Domestic Violence Act should be amended to allow interim variation of a
protection order or an interim protection order where
the respondent has not
been served with the application for variation, and the Court is satisfied that
it is necessary to do so in
order to ensure the safety of the protected person
or of any relevant children, pending hearing and determination of the
application
for variation.
Recommendations 31:
The Domestic Violence Act should provide that the Court should not vary a
protection order or an interim protection order where
the respondent has not
been served with the application for variation unless the application is
supported by evidence on oath (either
orally or by affidavit) from the applicant.
Positive Recommendations To The Respondent As A Term Of A Protection
304. Section 11 of the Domestic Violence Act currently provides that where the
court makes a protection order the Court may recommend
that the respondent the
aggrieved person or any other person participate in counselling of a nature
specified by the Court. It also
contains a power for the Court to direct the
respondent to give specified personal property, that is in the possession of
the respondent
and is reasonably needed by the aggrieved person, to the
aggrieved person.
305. The Committee considers that the Act should be amended to empower the
Court, at its discretion, to recommend that a respondent,
the aggrieved person
or any other person participate in any program of training, rehabilitation or
assessment of a nature specified
by the Court.
Recommendation 32:
That the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to empower the Court, at
its discretion, to recommend that a respondent, the aggrieved
person or any
other person participate in any program of training, rehabilitation or
assessment of a nature specified by the Court.
Publication
306. Section 30 of the Domestic Violence Act provides that it is an offence for
"otherwise than pursuant to a direction or order of a Court, to
print or publish by any means a report or account of any proceedings
Act if the printing or publication identifies:
(a) a party to the proceedings;
(b) a person who is related to, or associated
with a party to the proceedings,
or who is, or is alleged to be, in any way concerned in the matter; or
(c) a witness to the proceedings.
Restrictions
on printing or publication of proceedings
of restriction
307. Section 30 , therefore permits the printing or publication of proceedings
under the Domestic Violence Act but only in a manner
that does not identify the
parties, their relatives (including children), or de facto spouses, or their
witnesses. In that respect,
section 30 of the Domestic Violence Act mirrors
sub-section 121(1) of the
Family Law Act
308. Sub-section 121(1) of the
Family Law Act
, however, was amended in 1983 to
addresses the problem posed by the use of the words "print or publish" of
whether those words should
be interpreted in their ordinary meaning or by
reference to their interpretation in other areas of the law such as defamation.
confusion was removed by providing that a person is restricted from
publishing "in a newspaper or periodical publication or by radio
broadcast or
television, or otherwise disseminates to the public or to a section of the
public by any means, any account of any proceedings,
or any part of any
proceedings" that identifies a person referred to in sub-section 121(1). The
Committee considers that the Domestic
Violence Act should be similarly
309. The Committee notes that the inclusion of the words "or otherwise
disseminates to the public" would mean that the application
of section 30 would
not be confined to communications through the media; it would proscribe only
the voluntary dissemination of information;
and would include dissemination
only "to the public".
310. The Committee believes that the words "otherwise than pursuant to a
direction or order of a Court" should be retained.
311. The Committee does not believe that it is useful or necessary to proscribe
the circumstances in which "any account of any
proceedings identifies a person"
referred to in section 30.
Recommendation 33:
That Section 30 of the Domestic Violence Act be amended by deleting the
words - "print or publish by any means a report or account
of any proceedings
under the Act if the printing or publication identifies..." and substituting
the words - "publish in a newspaper
or periodical publication or by radio
broadcast or television, or otherwise disseminate to the public or to a section
of the public
by any means, any account of any proceedings, or any part of any
proceedings that identifies...".
312. Section 30A provides that section 30 does not apply to a party to
proceedings who informs a person of the contents of an order
made in those
proceedings. The combined effect of sections 30 and 30A have resulted in a
number of practical difficulties.
313. Firstly, a person who is not a party to proceedings, such as a lawyer for
one of the parties, or a Deputy Registrar, will commit
an offence if they pass
on information which is covered by section 30.
314. Accordingly, as sections 30 and 30A currently stand, they would create
a bar to the proposed amendments to the Domestic Violence
endorsed by the Committee, requiring the Registrar
of the Magistrates Court to notify the Community Advocate and the Director
Family Services of certain proceedings where a child is a party or named in
proceedings. The inclusion in section 30 of
the words "or otherwise disseminates
to the public", recommended above, would arguably permit such notification because
would not be a communication to the public. An alternative would be to make
the section apply "subject to this Act".
315. However, there may be cases where there is a fine line between whether a
communication is, or is not, a dissemination to the
public. It is not uncommon
for lawyers and Court staff to receive inquiries about a protection order from
the police, the DVCS, or
other services assisting one or both of the parties.
It is also not uncommon for lawyers to receive requests from a party to
proceedings
to advocate on their behalf in relation to matters arising from the
granting of a protection order, for example, in relation to emergency
and immigration matters.
316. A second effect of sections 30 and 30A is that once a party to proceedings
has provided information about the contents of an
order to a person as a
service provider (such as housing branch, the DVCS, a supervised children's
access service), it is arguable
that technically the person who received the
information cannot pass it on to others in the service.
317. Issues relating to the release and disclosure of information held by
services about families were considered by the Australian
Law Reform Commission
in its report,
Child Care for Kids
In considering
information collected by a department under the
Child Care Act 1972
the Law Reform Commission recognised that a blanket confidentiality provision
with no exception can inhibit good administration.
318. The Law Reform Commission was of the view that circumstances in which
such information should be able to be released include:
* if the person or organisation consents to its release;
* if a person is exercising powers, duties or functions under the Act and
release is for the purpose of achieving the objects of
the Act; and
* if the release is certified to be in the public interest (with the power to
impose conditions).
319. In considering the application of the criteria identified by the Law
Reform Commission, the Committee notes that the source
of information relating
to any order is the Court. Therefore, (apart from the circumstance where a
party to proceedings may inform
a person of the contents of an order made in
those proceedings under section 30A) the Court should be responsible for
of such information.
320. The discretion allowing disclosure must be sufficiently broad to enable
it to be subjectively applied to the circumstances
of each particular matter.
The insertion of a purpose clause and a principles
clause be inserted in the Domestic Violence Act, as recommended by the Committee
should assist in the exercise of discretion. However, safeguard mechanisms must
be put in place to ensure the accuracy of any
information released, and to guard
against problems arising from the dissemination of second hand information.
321. Consequently, the Committee considers that the Court, a Magistrate or the
Registrar should be authorised to certify the release
of information at any
time. To ensure accountability the Court, a Magistrate or the Registrar should
be required to record the nature
of any information released (including any
conditions imposed), to whom it was released and the purpose for which the
information
was requested.
322. Accordingly, the Committee considers that section 30A should be extended
to provide that section 30 does not apply where the
Court, a Magistrate or the
Registrar, at any time, certifies the release or disclosure of information,
with or without conditions,
upon being satisfied that the release or
disclosure:
* is relevant to a person exercising powers, duties or functions under the Act
and release is for the purpose of achieving the purpose
and principles of the
* is in the public interest; or
* is for a purpose which will promote compliance with the order.
323. As indicated above, the Committee is of the view that section 30A should
be retained.
Recommendation 34:
That section 30A of the Domestic Violence Act should be retained.
Recommendation 35:
That section 30A of the Domestic Violence Act should be extended to provide
that Section 30 does not apply where the Court, a Magistrate
or the Registrar,
at any time, certifies the release or disclosure of information, with or
without conditions, upon being satisfied
that the disclosure or release:
(i) is relevant to a person exercising powers, duties or functions under
the Act and release is for the purpose of achieving the
objects of the
(ii) is in the public interest; or
(iii) is for a purpose which will promote compliance with the order.
Recommendation 36:
That the Court, a magistrate or the Registrar be required to record the
nature of any information released or disclosed (including
any conditions
imposed) to whom it was released or disclosed and the purpose for which the
information was requested.
324. Sub-section 121(9) of the
Family Law Act
sets out specific exceptions to
restrictions on publication. Although they are all circumstances where it could
be said with some
confidence that the Director of Public Prosecution would not
consent to proceedings being commenced,
they remain
technically an offence against
section 30.
325. Consistent with the terms of sub-section 121(9) of the
Family Law Act
Committee considers that a provision should be inserted into the Domestic
Violence providing that
does not apply to, or in relation to:
* the communication, to persons concerned in proceedings in any Court, of any
pleading, transcript of evidence or other document
for use in connection with
those proceedings;
* the communication of any pleading, transcript of evidence or other document
to a body that is responsible for disciplining members
of the legal profession;
or, persons concerned in disciplinary proceedings against a members of the
legal profession, being proceedings
before a body that is responsible for
disciplining members of the legal profession;
* the communication, to a body that grants assistance by way of legal aid, of
any pleading, transcript of evidence or other document
for the purpose of
facilitating the making of a decision as to whether assistance by way of legal
aid should be granted, continued
or provided in a particular case;
* the publishing of a notice or a reporting in pursuance of the direction of a
* the publishing of any publication
intended primarily for use
by a profession, being law reports; or, any other publication of a technical
* the publication or other dissemination of an account of proceedings or of any
part of proceedings to a person who is a member of
a profession, in connection
with the practice by that person of that profession or in the course of any
form of professional training
in which that person is involved; or, to a person
who is a student, in connection with the studies of that person.
326. Noting that matters under the Domestic Violence Act can also be associated
with matters before various tribunals, such as the
Mental Health Tribunal, the
Committee considers that a provision in similar terms to sub-section 121(11)(b)
Family Law Act
should be inserted into the Domestic Violence defining
Court to include a tribunal established by or under a law of the Territory.
Recommendation 37:
That that a provision in similar terms to sub-section 121(9) of the
should be inserted into the Domestic Violence setting out specific
exceptions to restrictions on publication in
section 30.
Recommendation 38:
That a provision in similar terms to sub-section 121(11)(b) of the
should be inserted into the Domestic Violence defining Court to include
a tribunal established by or under a law of the Territory.
X of the Magistrates Court Act
Magistrates Court Act
, relating to restraining orders,
section 206P parallels section 30 of the Domestic Violence Act but there is no
equivalent to section
30A. The Committee's reasoning in relation to the
Domestic Violence Act provisions apply equally to Part X of the
Magistrates
. The Committee recommends that section 206P of the
Magistrates Court
be amended in accordance with recommendations 33- 38 above
Recommendation 39:
Magistrates Court Act
be amended in accordance with
recommendations 33-38 above.
328. Section 31 of the Domestic Violence Act provides that an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court from the making, variation or revocation
of a protection order,
or a refusal of the Magistrates Court to make a protection order. However, no
appeal is allowed from the
making, variation or revocation of an interim protection
order or the refusal of the Magistrates Court to make an interim protection
329. This means that an applicant who is refused an application for an interim
protection order, or who is not satisfied with the
outcome of an application
for revocation or variation of an interim order, has no remedy. Similarly, a
respondent who is dissatisfied
by the making of an interim order, or the
outcome of an application to vary or revoke an interim protection order has no
legal avenue
of complaint.
330. The Research Paper notes that in the three years from 1989 and 1991,
88 percent of applications for interim protection orders
were granted, although
the percentage had fallen from 90 percent in both 1989 and 1990, to 84 percent
in 1991. The Research
Paper suggested that the figures could reflect a slightly
increasing reluctance by the Court to grant interim protection orders,
was only one of a number of possible explanations offered.
The Research Paper does not contain figures on the
proportion of interim applications for variation or revocation granted by the
331. As to the duration of interim protection orders, the Research Paper noted
that the majority, 67 percent of those granted
between 1989 and 1991 were for
10 days or less. The rest were in place for longer periods of time, by virtue
of the extension
of the original. Eight percent were 61 days or longer. The
longest was 293 days. The average was 143 days, however the researchers
that this was not an informative way of averaging the data. Rather, both the
mode (most frequently occurring number)
and the median (point at which 50 percent
of cases are above and 50 percent below) showed that 9 days was the most likely
of an interim protection order.
The Research Paper does not contain figures on the
duration of interim orders for variation or revocation made by the Court.
332. There have been only two appeals to the Supreme Court under the legislation,
since it was introduced in 1986. The first case,
concerned the application of section 4(1) of the Domestic Violence Act., and
specifically the need for the reasons for judgment
of the Magistrate to state
in all facts that have been proven to the satisfaction of the court, and which,
as a set of facts,
fulfil at least one of the three alternative criteria laid
down in the section. The second was
in detail above.
333. Pursuant to section 31(1) of the Domestic Violence Act, the procedure
relating to an appeal is that prescribed at Part XIXA
Magistrates
Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act 1982
334. The nature of an appeal has been the subject of a number of judicial
pronouncements by the ACT Supreme Court. In
Bellington v Croker
Gallop J. commented:
"The nature of an appeal to this court from the Magistrates Court
pursuant to s 391 is by way of re-hearing on the evidence below
with a power to
receive further evidence. Where the decision appealed against is in the nature
of a discretionary decision, error
on the part of the magistrate must be shown:
Petreski v Cargill
(1987) 79 ALR 235.
On a question of credibility, this
court should generally defer to decisions of fact found by the Magistrates
Court which saw and
heard the witnesses. This court is not entitled to reverse
the finding of the Magistrates Court unless it is seen clearly to be wrong
grounds which do not depend merely on credibility, for example, on the ground
that the evidence which was accepted was inconsistent
with established facts or
was so improbable that no reasonable person could accept it, or that the
judgement of the Magistrates Court
disclosed that its conclusion was affected
by some error of law or fact:
Uranerz v Hale
(1980) 30 ALR 193
CJ at 189-9;
Abalos v Australia Post Commission
[1990] HCA 47
(1990) 171 CLR 167
Devries v Australian National Railways Commission
[1993] HCA 78
(1993) 177 CLR 472
particularly the judgment of Deane and Dawson JJ at 479-80."
Ericson and Southside Auto Alley v Von Krieston
Higgins J. held that for a finding of fact based on the accuracy and veracity
of witnesses to be an error of law, it must appear
that the Magistrate has
failed to use or has probably misused the advantage he or she has in seeing and
hearing those witnesses,
or that the Magistrate acted on evidence inconsistent
with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence or that the conclusion
reached was glaringly improbable.
Duttie v Roy H Weck and Associates (Aust) Pty Ltd
the Chief Justice commented that a Magistrate had
a distinct advantage over the Supreme Court sitting on appeal as the Magistrate
was in a position to assess the credit of the witnesses before him.
337. The course often adopted by the Supreme Court is for an appeal to be
concluded on the material before the Magistrate without
any additional
338. In summary, therefore, a strict test is applied on appeal and in
particular, the Supreme Court will be loathe to disturb a finding
the Magistrate who had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses.
339. Further, the institution of an appeal does not operate as a stay of enforcement
or otherwise affect the operation of the
order appealed from unless the Supreme
Court otherwise orders.
340. Given the short duration of the majority of interim protection orders
before final determination of the application by the Magistrates
strict test applied on appeal by the Supreme Court, the fact that the
institution of an appeal does not operate as a stay
of enforcement or otherwise
affect the operation of the order, the procedural difficulties inherent in the
conduct of an appeal,
and the recommendations in relation to the insertion of a
purpose and principles clause in the Domestic Violence Act, The Committee
not consider that any amendment to the existing appeal provisions is necessary.
Consequently, the Committee makes no recommendation.
13. Hearing of Application
341. The Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act regulates the procedure for
proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act, subject
to section 8 of the Domestic
Violence Act. Consistent with this interpretation of the law, the Supreme Court
has held that where
the procedure for taking any step in proceedings in the Magistrates
Court pursuant to `a law in force in the Territory' (for example,
the Domestic
Violence Act) is not prescribed by that law, the provisions of the Magistrates
Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act apply.
In the absence of any statutory requirement it seems
that the procedure to be adopted is for the Magistrate to determine having
to the interests of fairness and justice and the avoidance of unnecessary expense.
342. Section 8 of the Domestic Violence Act modifies provisions of the
Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act 1982:
* excluding the requirement prescribed by sub-section 22(4)(a) of the
Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act as to the fixing
of a return date on
the lodgement of an application. In this regard section 6 of the Domestic
Violence Act requires the Registrar
to fix a date for the hearing of an
application within two days of lodgement;
* excluding the procedure prescribed at section 199 of the Magistrates Court
(Civil Jurisdiction) Act relating to the reception of
medical evidence; and
* abridging the time limits prescribed at sections 206 and 207 of the
Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act relating to the
filing and service
of affidavit evidence and the cross examination of deponents.
343. Section 394 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act provides
that where the procedure for taking any step in proceedings
is not prescribed
by that Act or the law under which the step is to be taken, the Court may give
directions with respect to the procedure
to be followed as regards that step.
344. Pursuant to Section 394 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act,
the Chief Magistrate has issued practice directions
relating to `Proceedings
under the Domestic Violence Act and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act 1930
and `Conferences by the Registrar', the pre-hearing conferences undertaken by
Deputy Registrars of the Court. These practice direction
are at appendix A and
345. Consistent with the recommendation above relating to the need to improve
the clarity and language of the Domestic Violence Act,
the Committee considers
that there is a need to consolidate and clearly detail in the Domestic Violence
Act matters relating to procedure.
This would avoid the need to refer to
various enactments and practice directions for guidance in relation to matters
of procedure.
It would make the Domestic Violence Act a complete code and
enhance the clarity and application of relevant law
346. In this regard specific provisions should be inserted into the Domestic
Violence Act 1986
relating to:
* the institution of proceedings;
* rights of appearance;
* the reception of evidence;
* pre-hearing conferencing procedures; and
Institution of Proceedings
347. Section 22 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act regulates the
institution of proceedings by application. The scheme
of section 22, as amended
by section 8 of the Domestic Violence Act which, as noted above, excludes the
application of sub-section
22(4)(a), is simple and has proven easy to apply.
348. For completeness section 13 (as to the lodgement and filing of originating
process), and section 15 and sub-sections 22(3) and
(4)(b) to (d) (as to the
form and content of originating process) of the Magistrates Court (Civil
and incorporated into the provisions
of the Domestic Violence Act.
of Appearance
349. Section 406 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act currently
regulates rights of appearance before the Court. It
provides that a party to
proceedings may appear before the Court or the Registrar -
* by a solicitor or counsel;
* in the case of an individual - personally;
* in the case of a corporation - by an officer of the corporation duly
authorised by the corporation; or
* with the leave of the Court or the Registrar - by another person.
Sub-sections 406(2) to (4) prescribe the rights of a person who appears before
the Court to address the Court, and to examine and
cross examine witnesses, and
prohibits persons who are not barristers or solicitors from receiving or
recovering any payment for
appearing. The provisions of section 406 should be
incorporated into the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act .
350. Part XV of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act contains detailed
provisions relating to how evidence may be given
in proceedings.
Although specific provision for affidavit evidence
remains necessary (due to the need to prescribe time limits for service and notice
for the cross-examination of deponents), the detail of the remaining provisions
would become unnecessary if the Court was able
to inform itself on any matter
relevant to proceedings in such manner as it thinks fit, and dispense with compliance
with the rules
of evidence in appropriate circumstances. While this capacity already
exists within the scheme of Part XV, it should be expressed
in the Domestic Violence
Act in simpler terms to enhance its application. This can be achieved by providing
* evidence in proceedings may be given orally or in writing;
* the Court may inform itself on any matter relevant to a proceeding in any
manner it thinks fit and dispense with compliance with
the rules of evidence
(i) for proving any matter which is not bona-fide in dispute; or
(ii) where such compliance might occasion or involve unnecessary or
unreasonable expense or delay; and
* where the procedure for taking any step in proceedings is not prescribed the
Court may give directions with respect to the procedure
to be followed.
351. As to affidavit evidence, the scheme of sections 206 and 207 of the
Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act, as amended by
section 8 of the
Domestic Violence Act in relation to the time limits imposed, have proven to be
effective and appropriate. Those
provisions as amended should be inserted into
the Domestic Violence Act.
352. The pre-hearing `conferencing' procedure has been discussed in Part 1
of this report.
Its main purpose is to facilitate
the disposition and management of the matter, through the informal identification
and the provision of particulars. This case management process has
substituted the historical role of pleadings in civil litigation,
and has arisen
due to the Court assuming control of the processing of a matter in deference
to the historical role of the parties
in civil litigation.
353. The following recommendation defines and clarifies the functions of the
conferencing procedure and in doing so avoids the need
for specific legislation
regulating pleadings, the provision of particulars, interrogatories and
discovery. The capacity of the Court
to give directions in relation to
procedure enables these specific procedures to be applied where appropriate.
Pre-Hearing
Conferencing Procedures
354. As discussed above, the conferencing procedure developed by the Court has
become fundamental to the disposition of applications
under the Domestic
Violence Act. The process has two primary functions:
* defining and limiting matters relevant in the proceedings;
* ensuring that the parties are taking all necessary measures to enable the
matter to proceed as quickly and efficiently as possible.
355. Although the conferencing procedure is defined by practice directions few
lawyers and unrepresented parties understand the purpose
or function of the
process. While defining the purpose and principles of the Domestic Violence
Act, as recommended above, will assist
in focussing the process, the Committee
considers that the Act should re-enforce and clarify the nature of the
pre-hearing conferencing
procedure. This approach was adopted in the
Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994
356. To that end, the Committee proposes a twofold approach:
357. Firstly, as the object of the recommendations in relation to procedure is
that the Domestic Violence Act provide a complete
code, a provision in similar
terms to section 394 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act should
be inserted providing
that where the procedure for taking any step in
proceedings is not prescribed, the Court may give directions with respect to
procedure to be followed as regards that step.
358. Secondly, provisions which provide a mechanism for the recognition and
flexible application of the practice directions relating
to `Conferences by the
Registrar' and `Proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act and Part X of the
Magistrates Court Act 1930
' should be included in the Domestic Violence Act.
This could be achieved by authorising the Chief Magistrate to give such
to the Registrar as the Chief Magistrate considers appropriate for
the purposes of:
* defining and limiting matters in dispute; and
* ensuring that the parties are taking all necessary measures to enable the
proceedings to proceed as quickly and efficiently as
359. To expedite administrative processes, for the reasons discussed above, the
Committee considers that the Deputy Registrar conducting
a pre-hearing
conference should be authorised to make any orders relating to the scheduling
and preparation of a matter for hearing
that are consented to by the parties.
Such orders would include orders relating to admissions, undertakings,
interlocutory matters
and adjournments. This recommendation re-enforces the
recommendation made above that the Deputy Registrars authorised to conduct
conferences should have legal qualifications.
the attendance of Witnesses
360. Provisions relating to the summonsing of witnesses and the production of
documents are detailed at sections 187 to 190 of the
Magistrates Court (Civil
stage of proceedings to issue
a summons to a person (who is not a party to
proceedings) to attend to give evidence, to produce documents, or both to
give evidence and produce documents.
361. The provisions also enable a party to proceedings to serve a notice
requiring another party to produce specified documents.
362. Those provisions should be consolidated and inserted into the Domestic
Violence Act.
363. Sub-section 22(9) of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act
provides that each party to proceedings shall bear their
own costs unless the
Court otherwise orders. The sub-section further provides that where the Court
makes an order for costs the
Court shall direct the scale on which costs are to
be paid. This provision should be inserted into the Domestic Violence Act.
364. The Committee considers that an additional provision should be inserted
into the Domestic Violence Act in similar terms to section
Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994
, whereby the Court may order costs if
satisfied that:
* the conduct of a party to the proceedings has been frivolous, vexatious or
has not been made in good faith; and
* another party has reasonably incurred expenses as a consequence.
365. In so doing guidance is provided as to the exercise of discretion in
relation to costs.

procedural matters so as to make the Domestic Violence Act
a complete code and
enhance the clarity and application of relevant law.
Recommendation 41:

thinks fit; and
(ii) dispense with the rules of evidence for proving any matter which is

Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act (relating to the filing
and service of
affidavits and the cross examination of deponents) , as amended by section 8 of
the Domestic Violence Act (in relation
to time limits imposed) should be
inserted into the Domestic Violence Act.
Recommendation 45:
That a provision in similar terms to section 394 of the Magistrates Court
(Civil Jurisdiction) Act should be inserted into the Domestic
Violence Act
which provides that where the procedure for taking any step in proceedings is
not prescribed, the Court may give directions
with respect to the procedure to
be followed as regards that step.
Recommendation 46:
That the Chief Magistrate should be authorised to give such directions to
the Registrar in relation to proceedings under the Domestic
Violence Act as the

Mental Health
(Treatment and Care) Act
should be inserted into the Domestic Violence Act
whereby the Court may order costs against a party if satisfied that, the
of that party has been frivolous, vexatious or has not been made in
good faith and another party has unreasonably incurred expense
as a consequence.
366. This chapter deals with whether there should be amendments to the
and the Domestic Violence Act to provide for mandatory cancellation of
a weapons licence held by a respondent where a protection
order has been served.
into domestic homicides and the use of weapons
367. The most comprehensive research into homicides in Australia has been conducted
by the Australian Institute of Criminology.
It has involved an analysis of Australia
wide data collected on each homicide incident in each of the four years from 1989
and an aggregate analysis of the data collected over that
four year period.
The source of the data has been police records, collected
via the National Homicide Monitoring Program at the Australian Institute
of Criminology.
This was made possible through the support of the Australian Police Ministers'
Council and the cooperation of the
police in each jurisdiction.
368. The National Homicide Monitoring Program was established as a result of
recommendations of the National Committee on Violence
(NCV). In its report,
Violence: Directions for Australia,
the NCV noted the paucity of
information available in Australia on the incidence and epidemiology of
violence generally, and homicide
in particular. The NCV observed that
systematic information collection and analysis about homicide - the most
extreme form of violence
- was desirable not only to provide basic public
understanding about the question of homicide risk, but also to serve as a
foundation on which to base public policy in areas as diverse as child
protection and firearms regulation. As Strang states
"Only through understanding as much as we can about the circumstances
in which homicides occur, and the characteristics of those
involved in them,
can effective prevention and control strategies be devised."
369. From July 1989 to June 1993, there were 1267 homicide incidents in Australia.
Just under one-third (X percent) of homicide
incidents for the four year period
took place within the family. Almost two-thirds (62 percent) of these were between
both current and separated, with 9 out of 10 of these being committed
Notably, 45 percent of all female victims
of homicide between 1989 and 1993 were killed either directly or indirectly as
of a dispute between intimate partners as compared with 10 percent of
all male victims.
370. Non-intimate family relationships such as parents, brothers, sisters
cousins, aunts uncles and grandparents were evident in
20 percent of family
371. Relationships between a parent and a child (custodial, non-custodial
and de facto) account for 18 percent of family homicides,
and almost 6 percent of the total homicides between
1989 and 1993. Males were three times more likely to be offenders than females,
and males between 15 and 29 were responsible for nearly 60 percent of these
372. In (25) percent of homicides in Australia a firearm was the primary weapon.
In the context of homicide within the family, females who killed their intimate
partners used guns in just under 10 percent
of cases. Males who killed their
intimate partners used a firearm in 30 percent of cases.
373. The Australian Police Ministers' Council resolved in October 1991:
"to require the suspension of relevant firearm licences, prohibit
the issue or renewal of licences, and require seizure of all firearms
possession or control of all person against whom a protection order is in
effect, or other violent offenders."
374. Consistently, the Research Paper reports that senior police officers suggested
cancellation of gun licences of a respondent
to an order made under the Domestic
Violence Act and Court directed seizure of guns.
Current Law
375. In the ACT, two pieces of legislation regulate access to weapons in the
context of domestic violence - the
Weapons Act 1991
and the Domestic Violence
376. A basic policy underlying the
Weapons Act
is that a person should only
have access to firearms if they are considered "a fit and proper person" to
hold a licence.
An important consideration for
the Registrar of Weapons in determining whether or not an applicant for a licence
and proper person" is the propensity for violent behaviour, and particular
attention is given to that propensity in the domestic
377. Accordingly, under sub-section 24 of the
Weapons Act
, the factors that the
Registrar of Weapons must have regard to in determining whether or not an
applicant "a fit and proper person"
to hold a dangerous weapons licence include
whether the applicant:
* has, within the period of 8 years preceding the date of his or her application
been a respondent to a restraining order under
Magistrates Court Act
a corresponding order,
or the subject of a protection
order under the Domestic Violence Act, or a corresponding order; and
* is a person in respect of whom an interim restraining order is in force under
Magistrates Court Act
, or an interim protection order is in force under the
Domestic Violence Act, or a corresponding order is in force.
378. The relevant provisions in the
Weapons Act
are concerned with the grant or
refusal of a weapons licence under that Act.
Weapons Act
makes it mandatory for the Registrar of Weapon to refuse to grant a dangerous
weapons licence:
(a) if the applicant is a person in respect of whom -
(i) a restraining order is in force under the
Magistrates Court Act 1930
(ii) a protection order is in force under the Domestic Violence Act 1986;
(iii) a corresponding order is in force;
the applicant, or in the case of an application by one or more of a
number of partners for the purpose of the partnership, any of
the partners,
has, within the period of 8 years preceding the date of the application, been
convicted in the Territory or elsewhere
of an indictable offence, whether on
indictment or summarily; or
(c) in the case of an application by a body corporate - a director
of the body corporate has, within the period of 8 years preceding the date of
the application, been convicted in the Territory
or elsewhere of an indictable
offence, whether on indictment or summarily.
379. Further,
sub-section 51(3) of the
Weapons Act
makes it mandatory for the Registrar of
Weapons "to cancel a licence if satisfied that a ground for the refusal of the
grant of the
licence being a ground referred to in paragraph 25(b) or (c),
exists in relation to the licence."
380. That is, unlike the other grounds for the refusal of the grant of the
licence, the mandatory cancellation of a licence is not
extended to the grounds
set out in sub-section 25(a).
381. The Domestic Violence Act makes a distinction between regulation of access
to weapons where:
* an interim protection order is made; and
* a protection order is made.
382. Where an interim protection order is made, under section 14A (5) of the
Domestic Violence Act, the court has a discretion to
suspend the licence. That
section provides:
"Where the Court makes an interim protection order,
if the respondent is the holder of a licence under the
Weapons Act 1991
an order - (a) suspending the licence for the period specified in the order;
and (b) directing the seizure and detention
for that period of any dangerous
weapon or restricted weapon in the respondent's possession."
383. Where a protection order is
made, section 14A (1) of the Domestic Violence Act applies. That section
"Where a protection order is made in respect of a person who is
the holder of a licence under the
Weapons Act 1991
, the licence is by force of
this section cancelled unless the court is satisfied that a licence should not
be cancelled."
384. Pursuant to sub-section 14A(2), in determining
an application not to cancel a licence, the court is required to have regard to
the same matters that it must consider when determining an application for a
protection order as specified in section 10 of the Domestic
Violence Act.
385. In addition, where a protection order is made, the Court's power to
regulate access to weapons by a respondent is not limited
to the situation
where that person is the holder of a licence under the
Weapons Act
. Sub-section
s.14A(3) provides:
"The Court may, in addition to the making of a protection order,
order the seizure and detention for the period during which the
order is in
force, of any dangerous weapon or restricted weapon in the respondent's
possession."
386. Section 14A(4) of the Domestic Violence Act
"Where a licence is cancelled by force of subsection 1,
cancellation of the licence takes effect on the date of service of the order
on that person."
387. Accordingly, any cancellation of a licence
would take effect on the date of service of the order on the respondent to the
order, and any order under the Domestic Violence Act that weapons be
seized would over-ride section 58 of the Weapon's Act which
allows 7 days for
weapons to be handed in.
Applications
for weapons licence not be cancelled.
388. Advice from the Magistrates Court indicates that it is not uncommon for
an respondent to a protection order to make and be
granted an application that
his or her weapons licence not be cancelled. The fact that a respondent is able
to make that application
often determines whether he or she will consent to a
protection order.
389. This practice and more importantly the ability of a respondent to apply
for his or her weapon's licence not to be cancelled
is open to criticism for a
number of reasons:
390. Firstly, it is contrary to the resolution of the Australian Police
Minister's Council of October 1991;
391. Secondly, it fails to recognise and address the high percentage of
homicides in Australia where a firearm was the primary weapon;
392. Thirdly, it creates an anomaly with the
Weapons Act
, specifically:
* It is inconsistent with a basic policy underlying the
Weapons Act
person should only have access to firearms if they are considered "a fit and
proper person" to hold a licence, and the
criteria, set down in section 24 of
Weapons Act
, for determining that issue, which include whether the
applicant has, within the period of 8 years preceding the date of his or her
application been the subject of a protection order under the Domestic Violence
Act, or a corresponding order or, is a person in respect
of whom an interim
protection order under the Domestic Violence Act, or a corresponding order is
* If sub-section 25(a) of the
Weapons Act
requires the Registrar of Weapons to
a licence if the applicant is a person in respect of whom a
protection order is in force under the Domestic Violence Act, it is logical
consistent that the Court exercising jurisdiction under the Domestic Violence
Act should be required to cancel (or suspend) a
licence where a protection
order is made
* If a respondent is successful in an application not to cancel a weapons
licence under the Domestic Violence Act, and the licence
expires during the
period of the protection order, the
Weapons Act
makes it mandatory for the Registrar
of Weapons to refuse to renew the licence.
393. In this context, the Committee notes that in New South Wales the law
provides that the revocation of a defendant's shooters
licence is automatic
upon the making of an Apprehended Violence Order.
394. The Committee also notes that there appears to be an internal inconsistency
Weapons Act
. If, under sub-section 25(a) of the
Weapons Act
, the Registrar
of Weapons is required to refuse a licence if a protection order made under
the Domestic Violence Act or "corresponding
order" is in force, it would seem
logical and consistent that the Registrar of Weapons should be required to cancel
(or suspend)
a licence under the same circumstances.
395. The Committee considers that the
Weapons Act
and the Domestic Violence Act
should be amended to provide for the mandatory cancellation of a weapons
licence when a protection
order has been made and it is mandatory to refuse a
licence upon application under the
Weapons Act
396. In relation to the
Weapons Act
, sub-section 51(3) should be amended to
extend mandatory cancellation of a licence to sub-section 25(a), that is if the
is a person in respect of whom a restraining order under the
Magistrates Court Act 1930
, a protection order under the Domestic Violence Act
or a corresponding order is in force, as is the case with the two other grounds
for the refusal of the grant of the licence referred to in paragraph 25(b) or
397. In relation to the Domestic Violence Act, section 14A(1) should be amended
by deleting the words "unless the court is satisfied
that a licence should not
be cancelled", and accordingly would provide:
"Where a protection order is made in respect of a person who is
the holder of a licence under the
Weapons Act 1991
, the licence is by force of
this section cancelled."
398. Repeal of sub-section 14A(2) is a
necessary consequential amendment.
and Seizure
399. The capacity of a police officer to enter premises, search for and seize a
weapon is regulated by the
Crimes Act 1900
Weapons Act 1991
400. Sections 349A - 349C of the
Crimes Act 1900
enable a police officer to
enter premises to take such action as is necessary and reasonable to prevent
the commission or repetition
of an offence, a breach of the peace or to protect
life or property;
(i) when invited onto the premises by a person believed to be a resident of
those premises (sub-section 349A a)
Crimes Act 1900
(ii) in pursuance of a warrant issued by a Magistrate (sub-section 349A b) and
section 349B
Crimes Act 1900
(iii) in circumstances of seriousness or urgency (sub-section 349A c) and
section 349C
Crimes Act 1900
401. Section 349D of the
Crimes Act 1900
further enables a police officer who
has entered premises pursuant to sections 349A - 349C of the
Crimes Act 1900
for believing that its seizure is necessary. Under
the provisions of the
Weapons Act 1991
any seized weapons must be returned to the owner if charges
have not been laid.
402. Under the provisions of the
Weapons Act 1991
a police officer may enter
premises to search and seize anything that the police officer has reasonable
grounds for believing may
be connected with an offence against the Act. Entry
may only be effected;
(i) with the written permission of the occupier of the premises (sections 69 -
(ii) pursuant to a search warrant (section 72).
Sub-sections 14A(3) and 14A(5) of the Domestic Violence Act 1986 enable the
Court when making a protection order or interim protection
order to order the
seizure and detention for the period during which the order is in force of any
dangerous weapon, or restricted
weapon in the respondents possession. These
provisions do not enable a police officer to enter and search for any weapon
been ordered to be seized and detained. Recent amendments to the
Crimes Act 1900
inserted section 349DA which enables a police officer for the
purpose of executing an order under sub-section 14A(3) or 14A(5) to
premises, search and seize any dangerous weapon, restricted weapon or
ammunition. Section 349DA overcomes any practical difficulties
relating to the
execution of an order made pursuant to sub-section 14A(3) or 14A(5).
403. The Committee notes the Court's power to regulate access to weapons by a
respondent is limited to the situation where that person
is the holder of a
licence under the
Weapons Act
. The Committee does not see any logical reason,
and further notes that this is not the case where a protection order is made.
404. The Committee considers that sub-section 14A(5) of the Domestic Violence
Act should be amended by deleting sub-paragraph 14A(5)(b)
and inserting a
provision in similar terms to sub-section s.14A(3) to apply where an interim
protection order is made, as follows:
"The Court may, in addition to the making of an interim protection
order, order the seizure and detention for the period during which
the order is
in force, of any dangerous weapon or restricted weapon in the respondent's
possession."
Recommendation 51:
Weapons Act
and the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to
provide for the mandatory cancellation of a weapons licence when a protection
order has been made.
Recommendation 52:
That sub-section 51(3) of the
Weapons Act
should be amended to extend
mandatory cancellation of a licence to sub-section 25(a), that is if the
applicant is a person in respect
of whom a restraining order under the
Magistrates Court Act 1930
, a protection order under the Domestic Violence Act
or a corresponding order is in force.
Recommendation 53:
That sub-section 14A(1) of the Domestic Violence Act should be amended to
provide that - "Where a protection order is made in respect
of a person who is
the holder of a licence under the
Weapons Act 1991
, the licence is by force of
this section cancelled," and consequentially sub-section 14A(2) should be
Recommendation 54:
That the Domestic Violence Act should be amended by deleting sub-paragraph
14A(5)(b) and inserting a new section (in similar terms
to sub-section
s.14A(3)) which provides - "The Court may, in addition to the making of an
interim protection order, order the seizure
and detention for the period during
which the order is in force, of any dangerous weapon or restricted weapon in
the respondent's
possession."
Coronial Proceedings in Cases of Domestic Homicide
405. In Part 1 of this report the Committee discusses in detail that a systems
response to domestic violence and the ongoing review
of services are necessary
to ensure a coordinated and comprehensive approach to the problem of domestic
In this regard the recommended establishment
of the Domestic Violence Advisory Council and the position of Domestic Violence
Coordinator will play an important role.
406. In circumstances of domestic homicide the Coroner performs an important
role not only in determining the manner and cause of
a persons death but also
in performing a public interest function by reviewing the circumstances
surrounding a persons death. Sub-section
56(4) of the Coroners Act 1956
provides that a Coroner may comment on any matter connected with a death or
fire, including public
health or safety or the administration of justice. This
reinforces the capacity of a Coroner to review and comment upon systemic
relating to a death with the object of mitigating or preventing any recurrence
in the public interest.
407. The Coroners Act was recently amended to compel the Coroner to investigate
the circumstances relating to deaths in custody,
and to require the custodial agency, in whose custody
the death occurred, to provide a written response to the findings contained
in the report of the Coroner relating to the death in custody within three months.
The written response must include a statement
of the action, if any, which has
been, or is being, taken with respect to any aspect of the findings contained
in the report
of the Coroner.
408. These amendments to the Coroners Act recognise the role of the Coroner in
relation to systemic issues pertaining to a death
in custody, as well as the
social importance of the issue, and the need to ensure effective ongoing
responses. The Committee considers
that the social significance and
ramifications of domestic homicide necessitate similar responses.
409. The jurisdiction of the Coroner to conduct an inquest is prescribed at
section 12 of the Coroners Act. Under section 13 of
the Coroners Act, where
the manner and cause of death is sufficiently disclosed the Coroner may dispense
with an inquest. While
any domestic homicide would require the involvement of
the Coroner,
because the manner and cause of death
is normally sufficiently disclosed the Coroner may dispense with an inquest
thereby precluding
any inquiry into the effectiveness of systemic responses
or of services provided.
410. This issue is compounded where a person is charged with a criminal offence
as a result of a death, and the question is whether
the person charged caused
the death. Where this occurs after the inquest has commenced, the effect of
section 60 of the Coroners
Act is that the coronial process is suspended until
the completion of the criminal proceedings. Although the Coroner may then
the inquest, in practice it is dispensed with on the basis that the manner and
cause of death has been sufficiently
disclosed in the criminal proceedings.
In this context, it should be noted that where the Coroner continues the inquest,
Coroner cannot make a finding that is inconsistent with the judgment or
verdict of the Court which finally determined the guilt
or innocence of the
person charged.
411. The Committee considers that the jurisdiction of the Coroner should
specifically include domestic homicide, and that the Coroner
should conduct an
inquest in all cases of domestic homicide, not only as to the manner and cause
of death but also as to the broader
circumstances of the death, to enable the
Coroner to consider the effectiveness of relevant services and systemic issues.
This approach
is consistent with that adopted in relation to deaths in
412. To that end, the Committee proposes amendments to the Coroners Act as
* Firstly, section 12 of the Coroners Act should be amended to require the
Coroner to conduct an inquest where a person dies as
a result of any conduct,
or a result of any circumstances, which may have entitled the deceased to apply
for a protection order under
the Domestic Violence Act. (The Committee notes
that an inquest is currently held in all such cases).
* Secondly, sub-section 13(2) should be amended to provide that a Coroner shall
not dispense with an inquest if there are reasonable
grounds to believe that a
person died as a result of any conduct, or as a result of any circumstances,
which may have entitled the
deceased to apply for a protection order under the
Domestic Violence Act.
* Thirdly, to ensure that an inquest into a domestic homicide once commenced
cannot be discontinued or dispensed with where criminal
proceedings are
instituted, section 60 of the Coroners Act should be amended to enable the
Coroner to continue the inquest into the
systemic and service provision issues
that relate to the death. Where the manner and cause of death is sufficiently
disclosed in
the criminal proceedings the inquest would only need to address
those issues.
413. Given the inquisitorial nature of coronial proceedings issues arise as to
the manner in which enquires are undertaken and information
submitted to the
Coroner. Section 49 of the Coroners Act enables a Coroner to request the
assistance of a police officer in an investigation
for the purposes of an
inquest. The Committee considers that this provision should be extended to
enable a Coroner to request the
Domestic Violence Project Coordinator to
provide investigative assistance for the purpose of an inquest into domestic
homicide. The
role of the Domestic Violence Project Coordinator would not be to
determine the effectiveness of services or systemic issues, but
to compile and
submit relevant information. Alternatively, or in addition, the Coroner should
be able to require any relevant agency
to provide investigative assistance.
414. Consistent with the approach adopted in relation to deaths in custody,
the Coroner holding an inquest into a domestic homicide
should be required to prepare a report including any findings as to the
and effectiveness of services provided to the deceased by any relevant agency,
the responsiveness and coordination
of those services, and any other matter
which the Coroner considers relevant.
415. The report of the Coroner should be provided to the Attorney-General. In
addition, the report should be provided to the Domestic
Violence Advisory
Council, the Domestic Violence Project Coordinator and any agency or individual
named in the report or findings.
These agencies or individuals should be
required to provide to the Attorney-General a written response to the findings
in the Coroners report within three months of receiving the report.
The written report should include a statement of the action,
if any, which has
been, or is being, taken with respect to any aspect of the findings contained
in the report of the Coroner.
416. Section 20 of the Coroners Act provides that a Coroner shall not hold an
inquiry into a death in custody unless a member of
the immediate family of the
deceased has been notified, or reasonable efforts have been made to notify them
of the inquest. The
committee considers that this provision should be extended
to apply in circumstances of domestic homicide.
417. Any family member who has been notified of an inquest may, pursuant to
Section 53 of the Coroners Act, seek the leave of
the Coroner to appear at the
inquest. As section 53 enables the Coroner to grant leave to appear to a person
who has been summoned to appear to give evidence at the inquest, or who, in
the opinion of the Coroner, has a sufficient interest
in the subject matter
of the inquest, it is considered unnecessary to prescribe that any individual
or agency have a specific
right of appearance.
Recommendation 55:
That section 12 of the Coroners Act should be amended to require the
Coroner to conduct an inquest where a person dies as a result
of conduct, or as
a result of circumstances, which may have entitled the deceased to apply for a
protection order under the Domestic
Violence Act.
Recommendation 56:
That Sub-section 13(2) of the Coroners Act should be amended to provide
that a Coroner shall not dispense with an inquest if there
are reasonable
grounds to believe that a person died as a result of conduct or as a result of
circumstances which may have entitled
the deceased to seek a protection order
under the Domestic Violence Act.
Recommendation 57:
That section 60 of the Coroners Act should be amended to enable the Coroner
at his/her discretion to continue the inquest into any
systemic and/or service
provision issues that relate to a domestic homicide. Where the manner and cause
of death is sufficiently
disclosed in the criminal proceedings the inquest
would only need to address those issues.
Recommendation 58:
That section 49 of the Coroners Act should be extended to enable a Coroner
to request the assistance of the Domestic Violence Project
Coordinator in an
investigation for the purpose of an inquest into domestic homicide. The role of
the Domestic Violence Project Coordinator
would not be to determine the
effectiveness of services or systemic issues, but to compile and submit
relevant information.
Alternatively, or in addition, the Coroner should be able to request the
assistance of any relevant agency in an investigation for
the purpose of an
inquest into domestic homicide.
Recommendation 59:
That the Coroners Act should be amended to provide that the Coroner holding
an inquest into a domestic homicides:
(1.) shall prepare a report including any findings as to:
(i) the quality and effectiveness of services provided;
(ii) the responsiveness and coordination of services provided; and
(iii) any other matter the Coroner considers relevant.
(2) shall provide the report of his or her findings to:
(i) the Attorney-General;
(ii) the Domestic Violence Advisory Council;
(iii) Domestic Violence Project Coordinator; and
(iv) any agency or individual named in the report.
(3) any agency or persons referred to in para (2) (ii) - (iv) above shall
provide to the Attorney-General a written response to the
report of the Coroner
within three months of receiving the report;
(4) a written response under sub-section 3 must include a statement of the
action, if any, which has been, or is being, taken with
respect to any aspect
of the findings contained in the report of the Coroner.
Recommendation 60:
That section 20 of the Coroners Act should be extended to apply in
circumstances of domestic homicide and provide that a Coroner
shall not hold an
inquiry into a domestic homicides unless a member of the immediate family of
the deceased has been notified, or
reasonable efforts have been made to notify,
of the inquest.
Simplifying the drafting and layout of the Domestic Violence
418. There a number of difficulties with the drafting and layout of the Domestic
Violence Act. Some specific instances have been
referred to already in this report.
419. The Committee considers that there is considerable scope for improving the
clarity of the Act. The benefits of doing so are:
* to improve understanding - so that those who work with the Act - the Courts,
lawyers, the police and other agencies can readily
understand and apply the
* so that the Act can be read and readily understood by the public - including
those who represent themselves in Court; and
* savings in time and money, by making the Act easier to work with, and
simplifying training and community legal education etc.
of improving the clarity of the Act
420. The Domestic Violence Act should be revised using plain English and plain
legal drafting techniques. Headings should be descriptive
and modern formatting
techniques should be used. If words are used which are not in common usage (for
example, service, adjourn,
warrant, and aiding or abetting) there should be a
421. Cross referencing to other Acts and within the Domestic Violence Act
should be eliminated as far as possible so that the Act
is complete in itself,
and the need to turn to various sections and definitions, to understand a
particular section, is kept to a
422. Consideration should be given to a simple flow chart annotated with
section numbers, so someone reading the Act can quickly
work out which section
they need to read.
423. The following points need particular attention:
* The list of people who can be protected by a protection order should be
listed in one place and this should follow the section
which deals with who can
apply. If possible separate definitions should be eliminated so that the list
is complete in itself.
* The list of conduct which can result in a protection order should be set
out clearly and as simply as possible.
* The available content of an interim protection order and a protection order
(the order prohibiting any conduct which constitutes
domestic violence together
with the prohibitions, directions and condition which may be imposed) should be
set out in one place.
* The Committee would prefer that the provision which makes breach of a
protection order a criminal offence be located in the
. It should be
noted in the Domestic Violence Act that it is in the
Domestic Violence Act should contain a copy of the provision as an attachment.
Whether or not this recommendation is accepted,
the Committee does not think it
acceptable that provision which creates the offence of breach of a protection
order should be left
in the current location, under the heading
'Miscellaneous'.
Recommendation 61:
That the drafting and layout of the Domestic Violence Act should be revised
using plain English and plain legal drafting.
Recommendation 62:
That the provision which makes breach of a protection order a criminal
offence should be moved to the
and a copy of the provision should be
attached to the Domestic Violence Act.

O'Kane v Fogarty,
10 fam LR 449, (where an
injunction was sought under s. 53 of the De-Facto Relationships Act (NSW))
Young J., in considering guidelines
as to when the Court should use its powers
summarised the relevant law:
"The recent reported cases in the Family Court do not give
much assistance as
to what circumstances justify an order for personal protection.
Marriage of Murkin
(1980) 4 Fam 782
, Nygh J. makes it clear that an
order fore personal protection is made for the protection of the physical
integrity of a person and
not for their financial protection. (From) cases in
the Matrimonial Causes Courts over the last 80 years ... it is very difficult
to see an exact pattern. Sometimes inconvenience, much short of a reasonable
fear of physical assault have founded orders."
Freedmen v Freedman,
(1967) 1 WLR 1102
at 1103 Ormond J.
"No one, I hope, more fully realises than I do the enormous value of the power
of this Court to restrain molestation in proper cases.
It makes all the
difference in the world, as I well know from my experience at the Bar, to
people who are momentarily, at any rate
under grave pressure and in grave
trouble. It is a most valuable power, but is in my judgement to be exercised
reasonably and sensibly."

as to abusing, harassing or intimidating conduct, and
Parry v Crooks
(1981) 6 Fam LR 824
In the Marriage of Wilmoth
(1981) 6 Fam LR 80
suggested that the phrase `personal protection' should be widely construed so
as to include not only abuse and threatened
physical and mental harm but also
undue interference by one party with the other or the children of the marriage.
This approach was
followed in
Kemsley v Kemsley
(1984) FLC 91 -
567 where the Full Court of the Family Court said that the words "personal
protection" "not only apply to .. physical
protection, but ... are apt to
include such matters as the right to lead [ones] own life without undue
interference from the [former

power to the Commonwealth by all states except Western Australia the
amended to enable the court to make restraining orders for the protection of a
child, whether or not the child's parents
were or are married and in such cases
the Court can also grant an injunction for the personal protection of a person
