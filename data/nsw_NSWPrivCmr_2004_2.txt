Disclosure of full name when consent was given to use first name only [2004] NSWPrivCmr 2 (1 January 2004)
Disclosure of full name when consent was given to use first
Mr J was a member of a support organisation. He was invited to
participate in a forum chaired by an MP on the problems caused by the
which he had needed support. J agreed on condition he would be attending the
forum as a private person (i.e. not associated
with the support organisation)
and would be known only by his first name. This request was agreed to and the
meeting was a success.
Subsequently a local newspaper published an
article about the forum where J’s full name and his association with the
organisation was disclosed. After that he was approached by a number of
people, including his neighbours who indicated they were
now aware of his
problem. J was understandably upset and made a complaint to Privacy NSW. The
difficulty in this case was that a
Member of Parliament is not considered a

10,"Limits on disclosure of personal information" and Principle 11,"Sensitive
information". Privacy NSW asked the MP to conduct inquiries into the matter and
advise Privacy NSW as to the outcome.
The MP’s office responded
confirming that, despite agreeing not to divulge J’s personal information,
the mention of his
name and the connection to the support organisation was
mistakenly provided to the local media after the forum, along with that of
participants. The MP stated it was a genuine mistake and there was no intention
to deliberately cause J’s reputation
harm and an apology to J was included
in the response. The MP also stated that a meeting between J, the MP, and staff
from the MP’s
office has already taken place and J seemed to be satisfied
with the discussion. Based on the above response Privacy NSW was of the
that the complaint had been satisfactorily resolved.
