THREDGOLD, Holly Alexandra - Inquest Number 24/2019 (1648/2016), Responses [2022] SACorCResp 5 (17 June 2022)
Thredgold, Holly Alexandra (Coroner Whittle)
Recommendation 1
- That the pro-forma document in Sunrise EMRPAS which
succeeds the paper document ‘Medical Assessment of Patients with
Psychiatric
Presentation’ be amended to include provision for recording
the answer to a question as to whether a person is or has recently
treatment by a psychiatrist or psychologist, and provision for recording that
that psychiatrist or psychologist has been
collateral information.
Response from SA Health
The recommendation has been accepted and response incorporates actions by the
OCP, in consultation with the LHNs and state-wide services,
as detailed:
The OCP, through
the Strategic Mental Health Safety and Quality Committee (SMHQIC), is planning a
‘Barriers to Admission’
working group to address concerns raised in
relation to mental health presentations and assessment; in particular, the
family and longitudinal histories.
history of mental health treatment and contacting private practitioners, will be
a priority for this group.
LHNs support
this recommendation. A change request will be submitted to the Sunrise EMR
Mental Health Clinical Speciality Group.
Recommendation 2
That guidelines be prepared and issued ‘For the Care of Persons with
Comorbid Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorders
in Acute Care
Settings’. Consideration may be given to achieving this by amendment of
the South Australian Guidelines for ‘Working
with the Suicidal
Person’. The guidelines should acknowledge and state, in particular, a)
that the provision of mental health
services is not dependent on sobriety, and
is not restricted to situations in which there is a perceived risk of suicide
and b) that
the presence of alcohol and/or drug intoxication does not preclude
early assessment, although it may indicate the need for further
assessment when
the person is no longer intoxicated. When a request for assessment is received,
it is not appropriate to insist that
the person be free from the effects of
alcohol and/or drugs.
Response from SA Health
The recommendation has been accepted and response incorporates actions by the
OCP, in consultation with the LHNs and state-wide services,
as detailed:
It is noted that
the South Australian Guidelines for ‘Working with the Suicidal
Person’ is a document that requires review.
The suggestions
proposed will be forwarded to both the Towards Zero team and the ‘Barriers
to Admission’ working group
for their consideration with the intention of
updating this document. DASSA will provide assistance with this process.
The revision
will consider NSW Clinical Guidelines: ‘for the Care of Persons with
Comorbid Mental Illness and Substance Use
Disorders in Acute Care
Settings’ document, which includes evidence informed risk assessment tools
and screening processes.
Recommendation 3
- That clinicians
practising in hospital emergency departments should assess with a critical mind,
a patient’s denials of current
suicidal intent and should consider the
possibility that denials of important and critical circumstances may be
engendered by a desire
to be discharged from the hospital. In particular,
denials of suicidal ideation should be evaluated against the patient’s
medical history and collateral history, including collateral history
obtained from the persons treating psychiatrist or psychologist.
Response from SA Health
The recommendation has been accepted and response incorporates actions by the
OCP, in consultation with the LHNs and state-wide services,
as detailed:
supported by LHNs. It will be followed up through clinical education, and change
management (the Towards Zero approach).
The OCP will
continue to provide suicide risk mitigation training (the Connecting with People
approach) which includes demographic
and social/personal background, clinical
factors in history and mental state examination; and suicidal thoughts warning
This training is
available for all clinicians in SA. Recommended ED staff will be encouraged to
attend suicide risk mitigation training.
Recommendation 4
That the extent of availability at public hospitals of after-hours contact
details for private psychiatrists be investigated, with
a view to then
considering the feasibility of establishing a register of such details. This
recommendation
is made because the Court heard evidence from Dr Schirripa
that on a number of occasions as a private psychiatrist, he has not been
department. The suggestion was made that private psychiatrists’
after-hours contact details may not be available in emergency departments, but
this was not explored in this inquest.
Response from SA Health
The recommendation has been accepted and response incorporates actions by the
OCP, in consultation with the LHNs and state-wide services,
as detailed:
The OCP will
work with the LHNs to facilitate contact by public services with private
psychiatrists if a consumer of theirs presents
to the ED to discuss treatment
options (see response to recommendation 1).
It is noted that
private psychiatrists do make arrangements with public mental health services to
assist with consumers at risk when
they are on leave.
Psychiatrist will raise this issue with the Chair of SA Branch RANZCP, and the
local branch committee, to encourage private
psychiatrists to consider providing
their contact details to EDs if they have concerns about any of their consumers
and to discuss
the best approach to a contact register.
