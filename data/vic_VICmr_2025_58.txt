Reasons for Decision
Background to review
Applicant made a request to the Agency seeking access to the following
Retaining wall permit, plans and building surveyor who
approved/signed off on at [address] which has been built over the boundary.
the building surveyors details to make insurance claim as per [name] advice.
Agency identified 7 documents falling within the terms of the Applicant’s
request and refused access to all documents in
full under section 33(1). The
Agency’s decision letter sets out the reasons for its
Review application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under section 49A(1) of
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
have examined a copy of the documents subject to review. In addition to applying
section 33(1), I note the Agency also refused access
to certain content in the
documents under section 25 as irrelevant to the Applicant’s request. This
was not referenced in the
Agency’s decision letter; however, I have also
reviewed the Agency’s application of section 25 in my decision.
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section
49H(2) in relation to the review.
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
conducting a review under section 49F, section 49P requires that I make a new or
‘fresh decision’. Therefore, my review
does not involve determining
whether the Agency’s decision is correct, but rather requires my fresh
decision to be the ‘correct
or preferable
This involves
ensuring my decision is correctly made under the FOI Act and any other
applicable law in force at the time of my
Review of exemptions
Section 33(1) – Documents affecting personal privacy of third
I note the Applicant states they do not require the name of the builder, this is
only a small amount of information subject
to review. I have therefore
considered whether all the information in the documents is exempt under section
more information about section 33(1) see the FOI
Guidelines.
33(1) protects an individual’s privacy where their right to privacy
outweighs the public interest in disclosing their
information.
This will only occur
when disclosing the individual’s personal affairs information is
unreasonable.
document or information is exempt under section 33(1) if two conditions are
(a) the document or information relates to the ‘personal affairs’ of
a natural person (living or deceased); and
(b) disclosure of that personal affairs information is unreasonable in all the
circumstances.
Do the documents contain personal affairs information of other
individuals?
concept of personal affairs information is broad. Information will relate to the
personal affairs of a person if it ‘concerns
or affects that person as an
individual’.
This includes
information relating to health, private behaviour, home life, or personal or
family relationships of
individuals.
document will indirectly disclose personal affairs information if it contains
information from which any person’s identity,
address or location can
reasonably be determined. This means that a document can be exempt under section
33(1) where the document
itself does not contain personal affairs information,
but its disclosure would reveal personal affairs information.
affairs information can be revealed or indirectly disclosed by connecting or
linking the information in the disclosed document
with other information
available to the applicant.
documents contain the names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other
personal information of third parties. The documents
also contain residential
building plans, that ‘concern or affect’ a third party. These
documents are also personal affairs
information given the broad definition
described above.
am satisfied the information identified by the Agency amounts to personal
affairs information for the purposes of section 33(1).
Consultation
Agency is required to consult with affected third parties, unless it is not
reasonably practicable to do so.
have considered the consultation responses received by the Agency. I note that
one third party agreed to the separate disclosure
of their name and contact
details and these details were shared with the Applicant directly in the
Agency’s decision letter.
Would disclosure of the personal
affairs information in the documents be unreasonable?
determining whether disclosure of the personal affairs information would be
unreasonable in the circumstances, I have considered
the following factors:
(a) the nature of the personal affairs information;
(b) the circumstances in which the information was obtained;
(c) the extent to which the information is available to the public;
(d) the Applicant’s interest in the information;
(e) whether any public or important interest would be promoted by release of the
information;
(f) whether the individuals to whom the information relates object, or would be
likely to object, to the release of the information;
(g) whether disclosure of the information would or would be reasonably likely to
endanger the life or physical safety of any person.
considering the above, the documents and submissions provided by both parties, I
am satisfied disclosure of the personal affairs
information contained in the
documents would be unreasonable for the following reasons:
(a) The information contains structural plans and building permits, along with
the addresses, names and other identifying details
of third parties. The
information was obtained by the Agency in connection with its statutory role and
functions under planning and
building laws.
(b) I acknowledge the Applicant’s interest in seeking the documents as it
relates to concerns regarding their property. However,
based on the information
before me I do not consider disclosure is likely to provide a resolution for the
(c) I also consider that it likely the Applicant is familiar with some of the
third parties, given the documents concern a neighbouring
property. However, in
the circumstances, I am not satisfied disclosure is appropriate, noting that
maintaining the confidentiality
around the identity of an individual assists the
Agency to maintain the trust of the community to keep sensitive and personal
information
confidential.
(d) There is no evidence to suggest the personal affairs information in the
documents is available to the public.
(e) I do not consider that any public interest will be served by its
disclosure.
(f) The documents relate to a dispute the Applicant is having with their
neighbours. In these circumstances, the sensitivity of the
documents is
heightened. For this reason, I consider disclosure is likely to cause distress
to some of the third parties.
(g) In these circumstances I do not consider FOI to be an appropriate method of
disclosure, where I cannot place any restrictions
on the further dissemination
of the documents.
Accordingly,
I am satisfied that disclosure of the personal affairs information as identified
by the Agency is exempt from release
under section 33(1).
Section 25 – Deletion of exempt or irrelevant
information
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
whether it is ‘practicable’ to delete exempt or irrelevant
information requires an agency or Minister to consider:
(a) the effort involved in making the deletions from a resources point of
(b) the effectiveness of those deletions – that is, whether the edited
document still has meaning.
information is information, which is clearly outside the scope, or beyond the
terms of the Applicant’s request.
have considered the information the Agency deleted from the documents as
irrelevant. I agree it falls outside the scope of the Applicant’s
as the information does not relate to the retaining wall.
have considered the effect of deleting irrelevant and exempt information from
the documents. In my view, it is not practicable for
the Agency to delete the
irrelevant and exempt information, because doing so would render the documents
meaningless.
the information before me, I am satisfied certain information in the documents
is not relevant to the Applicant’s request
terms and the remaining
information contained in the documents is exempt from release under section
I am satisfied it is not practicable to provide the Applicant with an edited
copy of the documents with irrelevant and exempt information
accordance with section 25, access is refused in full.
