AUSTRALIA - WARDEN'S COURT
Opal Mining Partnership Dispute
STOJKOVIC v
[2016] SAWC 2
have heard the evidence, this is now my judgment in this matter. This was an ex
tempore judgment late in the day and I have edited
it as to grammar and syntax.
are two matters, one is the minor civil claim. I have noted that in my view that
is in the wrong jurisdiction, because that
is a partnership dispute in the sense
that should be in the Supreme Court. Be that as it may, I am importing the
pleadings in that
dispute into the jurisdiction that I clearly do have sitting
as a mining warden under the
Opal Mining Act 1995
. So no one is deprived
by that lack of jurisdiction in the minor civil action.
am dealing with a partnership in the sense that word has in long tradition, long
experience, many cases and which is recognised
Opal Mining Act
paraphrase the Act. The Wardens Court has jurisdiction to determine a monetary
claim in relation to a contract partnership or joint
venture arrangement related
to or associated with the acquisition of any mining tenement or a precious
stones prospecting permit
and the performance of mining operations under the
Opal Mining Act 1995
partnerships, which are common in the opal fields, are not partnerships in the
traditional sense known to common law and brought
into statute law through the
Partnership Act 1891
. They are loose contractual arrangements for the
pursuit of opal mining.
to one of the aspects of Mr Buck’s claim is that he had entered a
partnership with Mr Stojkovic in 2012 and it was of
general application to all
their commercial activity.
reject that. They entered a partnership purely for the purpose of opal
are several disputes here, I do not summarise the evidence, everyone sat through
it, but I turn to the key parts.
Stojkovic brought machinery to the opal mining partnership and he paid expenses.
Mr Buck provided his labour. Mr Buck received
25%, Mr Stojkovic 75%. It is
in dispute whether the expenses that have been incurred by Mr Stojkovic came out
before that division
of 75/25 or whether Mr Buck got his 25% off the top, so as
to speak; in other words 25% before any deductions for expenses. I will
to that at the end.
tunnelling machine had broken down, it had been repaired and Mr Stojkovic was
asked to do some work in the Opal Quest mine. Opal
Quest is not an opal mine as
such. It was originally within the Precious Stones Prospecting Field. It was
operated as a tourist
mine by a schoolteacher and other partners. It was
plainted for forfeiture and many years ago I adjourned that plaint for
while the claimholders pursued an application to the relevant
Minister at the time to excise the Opal Quest mine from the Precious
Prospecting Field.
did not actually make the decision to excise it, I merely gave the Minister the
opportunity to do so by preserving it and the Minister
excised it from the opal
it is that it has operated since as a tourist mine, not an opal mine for the
purpose of mining. Because it is not on the Precious
Stones Prospecting Field it
could not be operated as a mine unless the appropriate notices of entry to any
pastoral leasehold or
other relevant person and native title issues were dealt
with. It follows that when tunnelling on that one is operating in a commercial
operation not a mining operation.
follows, from my conclusion at the beginning, that the nature of this
partnership did not cover the work that was done by Mr Stojkovic
on that Opal
Quest claim. Even if it did, Mr Buck believes that Mr Stojkovic received
money for the work, but there is no evidence
to support that. The evidence I
have is that he was returning a favour and he was paid purely for the diesel as
and when required
and it may have been of the order of $3000 worth of diesel.
That would suggest enough diesel for 500 or so feet of drive to create
underground and none of that proves any claim by Mr Buck because it was outside
the mining partnership and Mr Stojkevic
was not paid for it. That aspect of the
claim must fail.
the core question is the expenses and whether they are off the top. Now in
support of the fact they are off the top, Mr Buck
has kept an historic
spreadsheet record, including a record of expenses and it is hard to see why he
would do that if expenses were
irrelevant to him.
on that, Mr Buck then says that because the expenses come out of and reduce his
entitlement that any compensation for expenses
such as the diesel rebate should
be assessed as income for the partnership and he should get his 25% of that, and
that forms another
part of his claim.
also claims money, in effect, as an accountant for assisting Mr Stojkovic for
filing his diesel rebate returns and he also claims
for the use of his vehicle
because Mr Stojkovic’s vehicle that he should have supplied to go out to
the claim broke the clutch
and so then they used Mr Buck’s vehicle.
In effect he says ‘Well I’m the one who has no obligation to provide
equipment, I’m providing equipment, I should be
compensated.’
MR STOJKOVIC: Apparently it is not just the clutch, it
is the whole motor.
WARDEN: And Mr Stojkovic says the damage was more than the clutch.
Stojkovic’s rejoinder for that is that the clutch was broken on an
occasion of use while he was away from Coober Pedy when
it should not have been
used but Mr Buck says ‘He left the keys with me and I was always entitled
to use it’.
then of course, we have the rebate. My understanding from the spreadsheet
figures is that in addition to 25% of the rebate there
was also an underpayment
according to Mr Buck’s calculations.
the conclusion that the keeping these records from 2013 when they started up
until last year implies that they are correct,
is that no complaint was made
over the claim made
for the Opal Quest work that I have covered. There is one
other aspect I have not covered and that is when some Japanese came through
they went down the mine. They did some filming and they paid some money to
Mr Stojkovic’s wife for entertaining them for
dinner on several
occasions. Mr Buck attended the dinners as well and Mr Buck says that they
must have paid money for the filming
they did on the mine. Mr Stojkovic denies
that they paid money and says he did it for goodwill to advertise Coober
is clear that if Mr Stojkovic made money by letting them view a mining operation
conducted within the mining partnership, Mr Buck
would entitled to money for
finding is on the balance of probabilities and the onus of proof lies on Mr
Buck. I am not convinced that the partnership here
was ever anything other than
the 25% off the top. I add that Mr Stojkovic gave evidence that Mr Buck was
paid the 25% off the top
of all the opal recovered over the four years of the
partnership. If there was a complaint to be made about how much money he was
getting on the way, on these oral partnerships like this, the parties should
make those complaints as they go along and not store
them up to the end because
for me to be satisfied on purely oral evidence of what has happened with cash
transactions is difficult.
I am not convinced that Mr Buck is owed anything and
I dismiss his claim.
Accordingly,
I now discharge the injunctive orders restraining Mr Stojkovic from retrieving
his equipment and I specifically authorise
him to retrieve the equipment from
the claim registered in Mr Buck’s name. How long do you need to organise
MR STOJKOVIC: He needs to hire a crane, he needs to see
when it’s free but he can start organising something tomorrow.
WARDEN: And long does he need?
MR STOJKOVIC: When I get the crane, two hours.
WARDEN: No, how long will it take for him to organise it, go out there, do the
job and be out of Mr Buck’s claim?
MR STOJKOVIC: One week to be on the safe side.
WARDEN: You have got 10 days to do it from today.
is a right of review in the small claim matter in the District Court; you have
21 days to exercise it. In the Warden’s
Court matter there is a right of
appeal to the ERD Court, which is part of the District Court Registry and I
think you have got 30
days to exercise that but again, you should, if you want
to keep the injunctive order over the equipment, do so forthwith.
Stojkovic you are not to go and get your equipment before Thursday, all right?
You are not to go and get your equipment before
Thursday, so that if he wants to
appeal, he can get the papers out tomorrow and let you know on Wednesday.
party can pay their own costs. The exhibits will be available for collection at
the end of the appeal period. The court is adjourned,
