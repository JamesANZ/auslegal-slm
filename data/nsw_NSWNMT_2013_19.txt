REASONS FOR DECISION
(RE: s163B(5) and costs
Introduction
24 September 2013 this Tribunal dismissed Ms Wang’s Application for Review
of an Order that she be de-registered as a nurse
that was made on 15 March 2010
by a differently constituted Nurses and Midwives Tribunal (2010 Tribunal). The
Reasons for dismissing
Ms Wang’s application are set out in
[2013] NSWNMT 18.
Tribunal dismissed the Application for Review in accordance with s163B(1) of the
National Law but reserved on making an order
specifying the time before which
this Order could again be reviewed (s163B(5)) and an order as to costs (clause
13 of schedule 5D).
This document sets out the Reasons for Decision on these
reserved matters following a further hearing on 2 October 2013.
summary of the 2010 Tribunal’s Reasons for ordering Ms Wang be
de-registered was set out by this Tribunal in
WANG v HCCC
[2013] NSWNMT
Issues to be dealt with in this Reasons for Decision document
determined that Ms Wang still suffers from the impairment and is not competent
to practise nursing and having dismissed her
Application to review the
de-registration order of the 2010 Tribunal, this Tribunal now determines whether
orders should be made
in accordance with s163B(5) and clause 13 of schedule 5D.
Suppression Orders
Tribunal notes that the 2010 Tribunal made a suppression order with respect to
the names of any member of staff of the Sydney
South West Area Health Service,
in particular those from Concord Repatriation and General Hospital or Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital.
This Tribunal continues the Suppression Order made in
HCCC v WANG
[2010] NSWNMT 9.
National Law makes the following provisions regarding costs at clause 13 of
schedule 5D:
Clause 13 Tribunal may award costs [NSW]
(1) A Tribunal may order the complainant (if any), the registered health
practitioner or student concerned, or any other person entitled
(whether as of right or because leave to appear has been granted) at an inquiry
or appeal before the Tribunal to pay costs
to another person as decided by the
(2) When an order for costs has taken effect, the Tribunal is, on application by
the person to whom the costs have been awarded,
to issue a certificate setting
out the terms of the order and stating that the order has taken
(3) The person in whose favour costs are awarded may file the certificate in the
District Court, together with an affidavit by the
person as to the amount of the
costs unpaid, and the Registrar of the District Court must enter judgment for
the amount unpaid together
with any fees paid for filing the
certificate.
Tribunal has a general discretion to award costs. There is no need to find any
special circumstances. This does not mean that
the power is exercised in an
unfettered or arbitrary manner although a successful party will have a
‘reasonable expectation’
of being awarded costs against the
unsuccessful party. This presumption will generally only be displaced where
there has been some
sort of disentitling conduct on the part of the successful

provisions of the National Law mirror the provisions in the previous
legislation, which is in similar terms to that in the
Medical Practice Act 1992
which was considered by the Court of Appeal in
Ohn v Walton
is nothing in the Second Reading Speech of the National Law that would displace
reliance on the interpretation placed upon the
terms of the legislative
provisions in a manner inconsistent with the principle in
Court clearly stated that the purpose of making a costs order is to compensate
the successful party rather than being
a punishment for the party against whom
the order is made – also see
Latoudis v Casey
(1990) 170 CLR
Tribunal exercises the discretion
‘according to rules of reason and
justice, not according to private opinion ... benevolence ... or
Williams v Lever
Tribunal notes that the provisions of s163B(5) are in near identical terms to
s149C(7). In general terms the time fixed by a Tribunal
in accordance with these
provisions will relate to the minimum time required by the previously registered
practitioner to address
the deficits identified.
Applicant provided a two page document headed
‘Response of Lih Huey
October 2013)’
and a copy of an email from
Associate Dean Peter Meier (Teaching and Learning – University of
Technology) dated 26 September
2013. The HCCC provided Supplementary Submissions
dated 25 September 2013 (a copy of which was received by the Applicant on 27
witnesses were called to give evidence during this phase of the Inquiry;
however, the Applicant provided supplementary material
which is recorded in the
transcript.
Submissions
Applicant’s Submissions
Applicant made a written ‘Response’ which substantially addressed
the Tribunal’s Reasons for Decision published
on 24 September 2013. This
document did not address the Supplementary Submissions made by the HCCC on the
question of s163B (5) and
costs orders. The Tribunal spent considerable time
exploring the Applicant’s position with respect to these issues. Once
the transcript records the steps taken by the Tribunal in this regard.
Applicant submitted that she would like the Tribunal to consider making an order
under s163B(5) that allowed her to make a further
Application for Review as soon
as she obtained the relevant psychiatric review that
‘allows it’
i.e. a period of less than three years.
respect to the costs order the Applicant stated that this matter had already
cost her a significant amount (for the psychiatric
assessments) and she was not
in a position to pay as she was only working part-time on a casual basis. The
Tribunal was also informed
that the Applicant did not wish to accumulate debt
that she would not be able to repay.
Submission made by the
written submissions of the HCCC were provided to the Applicant prior to the
continuation of the Inquiry on 2 October 2013. The
HCCC submitted that a
reasonable period of time for the Tribunal to fix in accordance with s163B(5)
would be a period of three years
and that any time less would be inappropriate
in the circumstances in light of the Tribunal’s findings.
HCCC submitted at paragraph 8 that a three year period is reasonable given that
the Applicant would need to reflect on the Tribunal
decision, gain the
appropriate level of insight regarding her impairment, seek psychiatric review
and potentially treatment, and
take steps to ensure her clinical competency is
at the level of a registered nurse by undertaking appropriate courses or study.
HCCC submitted that with respect to a costs order, there should be no departure
from the usual position and that there had been
no ‘disentitling’
conduct on its part.
Relevant considerations on the
issues to be determined
an aside, the Tribunal notes at this point that the Applicant pressed the HCCC,
then the Tribunal, to provide the name of a
psychiatrist who may be able to provide the psychiatric
review required. The HCCC indicated that it did not consider this to be its
– a position accepted by the Tribunal.
Tribunal accepts it has a role in assisting self-represented parties. This role
does not extend to providing specific advice.
Whilst the Tribunal would like to
be in a position to have provided the Applicant with the names of
‘suitably qualified’
psychiatrists, after hearing from the
Applicant on 2 October 2013 the Tribunal is of the view that the Applicant is
very likely to
assume that a report from such a psychiatrist would give her some
advantage before any future tribunal. In fact the Applicant’s
appeared to the Tribunal to be that all she would be required to do was obtain a
report from the psychiatrist (and
‘accept any treatment
) and then she would be in a ready position to make a
further Application for Review.
these circumstances, despite the desire to assist the Applicant, the Tribunal
must decline her request to provide the names of
qualified’ psychiatrists. This Tribunal notes that the names of
psychiatrists who give evidence in jurisdictions
such as this with respect to
impairments, is a matter of public record. This Tribunal encourages the
Applicant to make her own enquiries
in this regard.
Tribunal notes that the Applicant has made very little progress towards
remedying the deficits identified by the 2010 Tribunal.
In light of this, it is
open to this Tribunal to make an order fixing a period longer than three years
(being the period fixed by
the 2010 Tribunal) to ensure that the Applicant has
taken all appropriate steps required to support any future Application for
However, the Tribunal is mindful that its role is protective rather than
punitive. It also notes the considerable effort made by
the Tribunal on 2
October 2013 in assisting the Applicant to understand the findings made in its
decision of 24 September 2013.
Tribunal accepts the submissions made by the HCCC regarding the findings of the
Tribunal that the Applicant lacks insight regarding
her impairment and failed to
demonstrate that she had improved her clinical competency (see paragraph 5 of
the Supplementary Submissions).
The view formed by the Tribunal in this regard
during the first two days of the Inquiry was reinforced by the content of the
‘Response’ provided by the Applicant and her oral material
delivered on 2 October 2013.
Tribunal accepts the submission made at paragraph 8 of the HCCC Supplementary
Submissions. Further the Tribunal’s concerns
regarding the
Applicant’s lack of insight were heightened by the content of the material
she placed before the Tribunal on
2 October 2013 (see the written
‘Response’ document and the transcript).
Tribunal therefore intends to set a period of 3 years in accordance with
s163B(5). This means that the Applicant is not entitled
to make an application
to review the deregistration order for a period of 3 years from the date hereof.
While this Tribunal adopts
the view expressed by many other tribunals exercising
a protective jurisdiction that there is no public interest in denying the
possibility
of redemption, this Tribunal must also consider the appropriate (and
minimum) period of time that it considers will be required for
the Applicant to
be in a position to demonstrate remediation of all identified issues.
Tribunal accepts the HCCC submissions regarding costs and intends to make an
order in the usual terms. Whilst the Tribunal notes
the submission made by the
Applicant regarding her financial status this is not a matter relevant to this
Tribunal also expresses the view that given the nature of this matter any
further Application for Review should be referred to
the relevant tribunal (and
not any other review body). Further, a review of the entire transcript of these
proceedings may be of
assistance, particularly with regard to the question of
the development of the Applicant’s insight.
Noting that on 24 September 2013 in
Wang v HCCC
[2013] NSWNMT 18
Tribunal made an Order dismissing Ms Wang’s Application to Review an Order
that she be de-registered, hereby makes the
following further orders:
Huey Wang is not permitted to make an Application for Review of Order 1 in
Wang v HCCC
[2013] NSWNMT 18
until 2 October 2016
(s163B(5)).
Huey Wang is to pay the costs of the HCCC as agreed or assessed. If the parties
cannot agree on costs, liberty is granted for
an application to apply to have
the matter re-listed before the Tribunal to determine
