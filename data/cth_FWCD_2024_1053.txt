Alteration of other rules of organisation.
On 14 May 2024 the Western Australian Branch of the Australian Hotels
Association (the Branch) lodged with the Fair Work Commission
(the Commission) a
notice and declaration setting out particulars of alterations to the Western
Australian Branch rules. Further
material in support of the alterations was
lodged on 18 July 2024 and 4 September 2024.
The Branch seeks certification of the alterations under
section 159
Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009
On the information contained in the notice and declaration and
further material lodged, I am satisfied the alterations have been made
rules of the organisation.
The particulars set out alterations to Branch Rules 1, 3 – 23,
26 – 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, and 39.
On 18 July 2024 the Branch withdrew the alterations to Subrule 3(d)
and Rules 4 and 5.
On 2 September 2024 I certified the alterations to Rules 1, 3 (except
Subrule 3(d)), 6 – 8, 10 – 16 (except Subrules 16
G(b) and 16 G(c)),
17 – 23, 26 – 30, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38 and
On 4 September 2024 the Branch withdrew the alterations to Rules 9
The alterations to Subrules 16 G(b) and 16 G(c) are minor and
uncontroversial. They update legislative references. They were withheld
certification in the earlier decision because the references were incorrectly
made to the “FW Act” (i.e. the
Fair Work Act
than the Act.
4 September 2024 Branch
President Neil Randall gave consent under
subsection 159(2)
of the Act for me to
amend the alterations for the purpose of correcting typographical, clerical or
formal errors. Accordingly, the
following corrections have been made:
In proposed
Subrules 16 G(b) and 16 G(c), references to the “FW Act” are changed
to “FW(RO) Act”.
In my opinion, the alterations to Subrules 16 G(b) and 16 G(c)
comply with and are not contrary to the Act, the
Fair Work Act 2009
modern awards and enterprise agreements, are not otherwise contrary to law and
were made under the rules of the organisation. I
certify accordingly under
subsection 159(1)
of the Act.
