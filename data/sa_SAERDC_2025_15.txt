defendant and his wife,
Natalie Michelle Corsaro (
the Houghton Site

Waste deposited at
the Houghton Site
pleading to counts 6, 7, 9 and 10, being the offences that relate to the
Houghton Site, the defendants admit that construction
and demolition waste was
being received, stored and disposed of, so as to alter the topography of the
land, in the area identified
as Zone 2 as marked on the aerial image annexed and
: see T117L30-38. At all material times, the Houghton Site was
divided into two zones:
one contained several stockpiles of waste soils and dirt, which were mixed with
bricks, concrete, rubble timber and other waste.
It further contained piles of
old timber, wood, green waste, and the area had bricks and other waste scattered
throughout. Several
hundred cubic metres of waste were buried within zone
two is within the southeast area of the property. Zone two is a landfill
operation where a man-made platform, being an elevated
pad, has been
constructed. The landfill operation involved the depositing of mixed
construction and demolition waste, and the covering
of such waste with soil and
dirt, which has caused and created the ongoing expansion of the elevated
first and second defendant, having sorted the material in zone one that the
first or second defendant considered suitable, or
potentially suitable, for
re-use or sale then buried and disposed of some material in zone one, but
removed the majority of the remaining
material for burial and disposal in the
landfill operation undertaken in zone two.
Officers attended the Houghton Site in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019 and made
observations as to the presence of waste at the site.

letter dated 29 November 2019, the defendants were informed that the EPA was
making arrangements to undertake the clean-up of the
Battens and Pipeline sites.
The EPA indicated that it would accept an offer from the defendants to undertake
the work themselves,
provided they could meet the standards provided to the EPA
by the Chief Advisor Construction and Utilities of Safe Work SA. The defendants
were put on notice that the EPA would seek to recover the costs of the clean up
from the defendants. In the absence of an appropriate
response from the
defendants agreeing to clean-up the sites, the EPA arranged and implemented the
clean-up of both site. Annexed

Facts were agreed at trial as follows:
The first defendant, Port Adelaide Salvage SA proprietary limited (Port
Adelaide Salvage) is a registered company (ACN 101 249 405)
and has, at all
material times, operated as a demolition business. That business involves the
demolition of residential and commercial
properties across the Adelaide
metropolitan region and the removal and depositing of mixed construction waste
created as a result
of such demolition activities.
The second defendant, MC, and his wife, NC are equal shareholders of Port
Adelaide salvage. The sole director and secretary of the
company is the second
At all material times MC directed the operations of Port Adelaide Salvage.
The specific activities of Port Adelaide Salvage were either
undertaken or
directed by him by directing employees and contractors of Port Adelaide
Trucks registered to MC are used by Port Adelaide Salvage in the conduct of
the Port Adelaide Salvage demolition business. At all
material times, MC owned
the following vehicles and trailers which we used as part of the demolition
business of Port Adelaide Salvage:
Volvo prime mover, registration number SB99BP (Volvo Prime Mover);
A “Lusty Loader” (used to transport an excavator from demolition
site to demolition site), registration number TBG083;
Gitsham Trailer, registration number TCE175 (the Prime mover trailer). This
trailer has the capacity to carry at least 20 tonnes.
It is used by Port
Adelaide Salvage attached to the Volvo prime mover.
Volvo truck, UPG 848 and;
Volvo truck, WDX575 (Rigid Truck). This truck has the capacity to carry at
least 10 tonnes.
At all material times, Port Adelaide Salvage held a licence, pursuant to the
Act, authorising it to conduct a waste transport business
according to its
terms. The terms of that licence are consistent with the licence issued on 1
February 2019.
At no time has either Port Adelaide Salvage or MC held a licence or
authorisation under the act for the operation of a waste facility,
and/or re-use and recycling depot at Lot 1 Battens Road, Sedan South Australia
(The Battens Road Site) or Pipeline Road,
Sedan (The Pipeline Site).
In early 2018, as a result of public information relayed via the mid Murray
Council, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) became
aware of suspected
illegal dumping of mixed waste at the Battens Road Site.
The Battens Road Site is a rural property located north-east of Sedan and 27
km from Angaston. The site is primarily used for pastoral
dryland farming (crop
production and grazing). The Battens Road Site was, at all material times, owned
by Christopher John Seidel
of Lot 7 Halfway House Road, Sedan.
Christopher Seidel died on 23 August 2018. At all material times, he lived at
the house with his wife Lynette Seidel, at Lot 7 Halfway
House Road. Mr Seidel
did not at any time hold a licence or authorisation to conduct a waste depot, or
any other prescribed activity
of environmental significance at Lot 1 Battens
Road Sedan, Lot 96 Pipeline Road Sedan or any other property that he owned or
Between 27 October 2017 of 31 May 2018 there were, towards the northern end
of the Battens Road Site, in excess of 100 piles of waste
located within two
areas that were not cropped or being grazed. The waste piles contained mixed
demolition waste and were not uniform
in composition. The following material was
within the stockpiles of waste:
matter and green waste
and wall tiles
household waste including plastics and paper (including a Christmas tree, soft
toys, clothing, books and personal effects)
documentation such as bank records
Whilst at the site on 15 March
2018, EPA officer Adam Lewis took aerial photographs of the site using a drone.
Mr Lewis launched the
drone from Bronco Road, Sedan, and flew it over the site.
He subsequently produced several 3D images showing the waste.
Using the data contained from the drone flight above the property on 15 March
2018, Mr Lewis compared to the material stockpiled on
the property between 14
and 19 January 2014 and 15 March 2018. A copy of this analysis including maps
generated by him is contained
in the tender books.

officer, Dion Buring, by stepping towards him and applying
slight force to his
left shoulder, in a pushing or shoving action.
Circumstances of the defendants
director is 55 years of age. He completed year 9 of High School and was then
apprenticed as a mechanic. Having completed that
indenture, he started work with
his father, the founder of the company, which had since the early 90’s
operated a demolition
business, principally for construction sites.
director took over management of the company in the early 2000’s and has
since been its controlling mind. For about 6 months
the stress of investigation
and prosecution impacted the director’s mental health and ability to work.
director has been married since 1996. He resides with his wife at the Houghton
site, which is an area of about 30 acres. The
property is mortgaged. One of his
two children is recently deceased; the result of motorcycle accident in
company has ceased trading and is maintained only for these
proceedings.
The plant and
equipment of the business is owned by the director.

offending. Conservatively, by not lawfully dumping
the material, it gained more
than $1,000,000. Conservatively, the company avoided payment to the EPA of the

am guarded about the prospects of rehabilitation of the company and the director
and as to their risk of re-offending because the
offending in this case was done
with an awareness of the need for a licence. It was also done despite the
imposition of past penalties.
It involved actions for significant commercial
gain and it was sophisticated and deceptive. It involved an arrangement with a
party for use of their land and failures to comply with clean-up
offending in this case is a serious example of its type.
my consideration of penalty, I have been mindful of the relationship between the
two defendants as already explained and the ultimate
penalties imposed should
reflect the inherent criminality in the whole of this offending.
primary purpose of sentencing in respect of environmental offending is the
protection of the safety of the community. Unlawful
dumping harms the community
and detracts from general amenity and the enjoyment of the community of

Parliament has nonetheless recognised that activities of environmental
significance which cause harm must be undertaken. It has
enacted a statutory
regime to allow for such environmental harm by establishing a regulator, setting
up a system for the licensing
and regulation of such activities and the
imposition of conditions. Further, fees and levies collected under that regime

defendants, to comply with that regime.
demonstrated by this case, offending of this nature is difficult and costly to
detect and prosecute.
and general deterrence also have a significant role to play. A strong message
must be sent to deter the defendants and others
from offending in this way.
the offending history of these defendants, specific deterrence has an even more
heightened role. I consider the defendants
in this case preferred profit and
their commercial interests over environmental safety and harm. Fines imposed in
cases such as this
must therefore not just reflect a cost of doing business. The
fines to be imposed must reflect the conservative commercial benefit
the company and the detriment suffered by the community by non-payment of fees
and levies of up to $2,000,000.00.
I have had regard to the circumstances of the defendants, it is the case that
the individual circumstances of offenders, in
these types of cases, have less
weight as it is regulatory offending.
Particularly,
I have had regard to the impact a significant fine will have on the director.
While the ability of the company to pay
any fine is unknown, the director has an
interest in the Houghton Site, albeit mortgaged. No submission was made that

to Count 6, I adopt a starting point of a $50,000 fine of the company. If
satisfied good reason exists, that penalty may be reduced
trial had been called on when the plea to Count 6 was entered. As it involved
offending at his residential property, and the
informant had been required to be
ready to prove those facts, I see no good reason to reduce that penalty.
to Count 7, I adopt a starting point of a $20,000 fine of the director.
for any discount, I decline to reduce that sentence for the reasons expressed in
respect of Count 6.
to Count 9, I adopt a starting point of a $50,000 of the company.
for any reduction, that plea had been entered after the trial had commenced and
the informant had been required to be ready to
prove those facts. For that
reason, I see no good reason to reduce that penalty.
to Count 10, I adopt a starting point of a $20,000 fine of the director. If
satisfied there is good reason to do so, any penalty
may be reduced by up to
I decline to do so for the
reasons expressed in relation to Count 9.
to Count 12, I adopt a starting point of a $20,000 fine of the director. And a
fine of $20,000 for the director. The trial had
been called on when those pleas
were entered. As the informant had been required to be ready to prove those
facts, I see no good
reason to reduce that penalty.
to Count 13, the company and director were jointly charged. Conscious of that, I
adopt a starting point of $10,000 fine of the
company and a $10,000 fine of the
director. As for any reduction, I take the same approach as for Count 12, noting
the trial had
commenced when those pleas were entered.
to Count 14, the company and director were jointly charged. Conscious of that, I
adopt a starting point of a $10,000 fine of the
company and a $10,000 fine of
the director. As for any reduction, I take the same approach as I have taken
with Counts 12 and 13
and decline to make any reduction.
to Count 15, I adopt a starting point of a $5,000 fine of the director. As for
any reduction, the prosecution case was a strong
one and the plea was entered at
trial. Accordingly, I see no good reason to reduce that penalty.
for Count 16, I adopt a starting point of a $7,500 fine of the director.
for Count 17, I adopt a starting point of a $5,000 fine of the director. As for
any reduction, the plea was entered at trial in
the face of a strong prosecution
case. Accordingly, I see no good reason to reduce that penalty.
respect of Counts 6 and 9, and 7 and 10, those charges arose out of the same
facts and are respectively a single continuous incursion
into offending.
reason there were two charges in respect of 6 and 9 and 7 and 10, was due to a
legislative charge. I consider those fines, in
respect of both the company and
the director do relate a single act of criminality. I adopt a single starting
point for both of Counts
6 and 9 of $50,000 and for Counts 7 and 10 of
the starting points in Counts 1, 4, 6 and 9 and 13 and 14 would result in a
penalty of $170,000. I impose a single fine
of $170,000 against the company for
the whole of its offending in Counts 1, 4, 6, 9, 13 and 14, to reflect the
inherent criminality
in that offending.
the starting points for Counts 2, 5, 7 and 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 would
result in a cumulative penalty of $117,500.
I fix a single penalty of $117,500
in respect of the director, to reflect the inherent criminality in the whole of
his offending.
total quantum of the penalties imposed on the company and the director total
$287,500. There will also be victims of crime levies
payable in respect of each
of those offences.
further make an order the defendants pay the informants costs of this
prosecution in an amount agreed;
