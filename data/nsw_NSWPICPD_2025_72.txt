INTRODUCTION
applicant/defendant, Brooks Farms Pty Limited, seeks to strike out the
respondent/claimant’s, Jamie David Summers, Pre-Filing
Statement (PFS).
The strike out application and attached submissions in support were signed by
the applicant on 28 August 2025. These
submissions are annexed to this decision
and marked with the letter “A”.
filing of a PFS is a necessary pre-condition before the commencement of court
proceedings claiming work injury
A PFS remains current
until struck out or withdrawn by the person who filed
An application to strike out a
PFS may not be made until at least six months have elapsed since the defence to
the PFS was served
on the claimant.
A PFS may not be struck out if the injured worker’s degree of permanent
impairment is not fully
ascertainable.
which are relevant to the exercise of the discretion to strike out a PFS were
discussed in
John Lacey Earth Moving Pty Ltd v
Campbell-Willis
President Byron at [46]. Byron AP noted in that matter that there was no
evidence that court proceedings had been commenced,
nor that any active steps to
resolve the matter had been taken and that the respondent/claimant had been
given every opportunity
to be heard in response to the application to strike out
the PFS and had failed to do so. President Keating in
stated that the policy
underpinning s 151DA(3) of the
Workers Compensation Act 1987
1987 Act) was to give parties sufficient time to finalise all pre-litigation
requirements. His Honour further recorded that
the section provided certainty by
not extending time indefinitely while the PFS was current.
applicant has provided a history of the matter in Annexure “A”
beneath the heading “Background”. It is
apparent from a
consideration of this aspect of the submissions, that the requirements of
ss 151DA(3) and (4) of the 1987 Act have
been met. In particular, the
Personal Injury Commission of New South Wales (Commission) issued a Certificate
of Determination in
matter no. W5277/23 on 14 September 2023 ordering payment to
the respondent worker of benefits under s 66 of the 1987 Act in respect
39% whole person impairment resulting from an injury suffered on 14 November
2014 (incorrectly recorded as 7 November 2014 on
the Certificate).
PFS in this matter was served on 6 August 2024. The respondent had been employed
by the applicant as a farm hand at the applicant’s
farm in Barooga, NSW.
On 14 November 2014 while in the course of his employment with the applicant,
the respondent suffered injury
to his neck and right shoulder. A defence to the
PFS was served on 16 September 2024. A mediation conducted by a Commission
took place on 15 November 2024, which was not successful in resolving
the dispute.
would note that at all times in this dispute, both parties have been legally
represented.
respondent’s legal representative, Messrs Don Cameron and Associates, on 3
October 2025 have confirmed their client’s
instructions in response to
this application are to neither consent to nor oppose the application.
history of the matter as described in Annexure “A” has not been
disputed. The events subject to these proceedings
took place on 14 November
2014, almost eleven years ago. The limitation period provided for in s 151D(2)
of the 1987 Act expired
in November 2017, almost 8 years ago. This does not mean
that these proceedings are a nullity, s 151D of the 1987 Act has been held
to be a procedural provision.
does mean, however, that the utility of the PFS extending time for the
respondent in which to bring work injury damages proceedings
is nugatory.
light of the respondent’s decision not to resist this application or
challenge any of the matters put by the applicant, this
is a powerful factor in
granting the orders. The cause of action arose almost eleven years ago. The
applicant asserts that it is
suffering prejudice in the defence of the
proceedings due to this delay. Although the applicant does not identify any
specific matter
of prejudice, for example a witness no longer being available, I
accept that some prejudice would arise due to the effluxion of time.

NSW Police Force v
at [14], which is
relied on by the applicant, the filing of a PFS is not designed to
“park” a work injury damages claim

opportune to proceed. It is designed to enable all pre-litigation steps to be
finalised, and the matter

has not evinced any intention to pursue these proceedings,
even after this
application had been made. Finally, since the respondent does not oppose these
orders and having regard to what I
have set out above, I consider that it is
therefore appropriate to exercise my discretion to strike out the PFS.

intentions for this claim:
Orders Sought and Submissions in Support
The Applicant submits that the Pre-Filing Statement
ought to be struck out pursuant to
section 151DA(3)
Compensation Act 1987
A period greater than six months has elapsed since the Applicant’s
service of the Pre-Filing Defence pursuant to
section 316
Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998
. The requirements of
section 151DA(3) have therefore been met.
The Respondent’s injuries have been assessed at 39% WPI, and there is
no impediment in respect of section 151D(4) of the
Workplace Injury
Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998
The Applicant submits that there is no evidence to support that the
Respondent has taken any steps to progress her claim since the
Mediation held on
15 November 2024.
As stated by President Judge Phillips in
NSW Police Force v Fajloun
[2024] NSWPICPD 77:
“The filing of a PFS is not designed to ‘park’ a work
injury damages claim until a worker decides it opportune to
proceed. This is
contrary to the legislative purpose as stated by President Keating in
, which is to enable the parties to finalise all pre-litigation
steps. Those steps have self evidently been completed in this matter.
respondent does not wish to proceed, then it is proper and appropriate to strike
out the PFS.” [at 14]
As stated by President Justice Terry Sheahan in
Pasminco Cockle Creek
Smelter Pty Ltd v Gardner
[2006] NSWWCCPD 108:
“It is clearly not the intention of the legislature that the time limit
which a claimant may bring work injury damages proceedings
should be extended
indefinitely by the operation of these provisions. Claimants must actively
pursue the required steps throughout
this pre-litigation process. The pre-filing
statement should remain current for the purpose of completing those required
The Applicant submits that the Respondent has had ample time to complete the
pre-litigation phase of the proceedings and file a Statement
of Claim. As stated
by President Judge Keating in [
Luke v McCarthy
“There are sound policy reasons for the inclusion of section 151DA(3)
in the 1987 Act. Its inclusion in the Act is to provide
the parties with
sufficient time to finalise the pre-litigation phase of the proceedings. It
brings a degree of certainty to the
process and enables the parties to explore
resolution and/or mediation of the claim, before embarking on litigation.”
The Applicant submits that it has been prejudiced by the Respondent’s
substantial delay in pursuing proceedings and continues
to be prejudiced by the
operation of section 151DA(1)(b) which stops time for the purposes of section
151D while the Pre-Filing Statement
is current (
Workers Compensation Nominal
Insurer v England
[2011] NSWWCCPD 41).
The Applicant seeks the following orders:
Pre-Filing Statement can be struck out pursuant to
section 151DA(3)
Workers Compensation Act 1987
order as to costs.
Section 315
Injury Management and
Workers Compensation Act
Section 151DA(2) of
Workers Compensation Act 1987

Section 151DA(4) of
the 1987 Act.
