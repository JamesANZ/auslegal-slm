On 10 October 2025, I vacated a ten-day trial on the application of
the defendants:
The Owners Strata Plan 99170 v MN Builders Pty Ltd
NSWSC 1190.
By their motion, the defendants had sought the costs of their motion
and the costs thrown away by reason of vacation of the hearing.
I made those
orders as well.
plaintiff sought to make submissions in respect of the costs orders. Directions
were made by consent for such submissions to be
plaintiffs submit that the appropriate order is that the costs of the motion and
the costs thrown away be the defendants’
costs in the cause. This is
because the defendants did not promptly respond to the plaintiff’s initial
letter foreshadowing
the service of further expert evidence. The defendants
later consented to the plaintiff being given leave to rely on that evidence
did not begin work on preparing evidence in response until after a mediation in
September 2025. Further, the defendants consented
to leave being granted to the
plaintiff to rely on the further expert evidence without raising with the Court
the possibility that
this would imperil the hearing (although I note that the
defendants squarely raised this with the plaintiff in correspondence) and
without having spoken to the defendants’ quantum expert at all about the
evidence required. (I am unsure what follows from
this, where there was no
dispute that Mr Archer could not begin work until the plaintiff’s experts
had finished theirs).
the plaintiff submitted that the defendants’ experts were unavailable due
to matters outside the plaintiff’s
control, including other commitments,
overseas travel, leave and injury. Finally, while the plaintiff opposed the
vacation of the
trial, it was said to have cooperated in getting the motion
heard on a very tight timetable and otherwise acting expeditiously.
admirably brief submissions, the defendants submitted that there was nothing in
the plaintiff's submissions that warranted a departure
from the usual rule that
costs ought follow the event:
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005
(NSW) r 42.1.
The motion to vacate was occasioned by reason of the plaintiff’s default
in serving its evidence in accordance
with directions or within the timeframes
indicated by it in correspondence or within such time as to allow the defendants
to properly
respond whilst preparing for a hearing. The plaintiff's submissions
neither explained nor justified these defaults.
agree. The details of how the hearing came to be vacated are set out in my
earlier judgment. In short, from May 2025 on, the plaintiff
served further
liability and quantum expert evidence, on which it needed the leave of the Court
to rely. The defendants squarely
raised the prospect that the trial date would
be lost by reason of this material but did attempt to meet the challenge which
service of this material presented. The defendants consented to leave being
given to the plaintiff to rely on this material and also
agreed to a timetable
to put on evidence in reply. But the plaintiff’s evidence kept coming.
Indeed, the plaintiff served a
975-page supplementary quantum report the day
before the motion to vacate was heard.
defendants did defer incurring further costs in meeting the late-served material
until after a mediation had been completed. Whilst
the defendants’ ability
to meet this material would have been enhanced if it had tasked its experts with
replying to that material
immediately on receipt of the late reports, it was not
unreasonable for the defendants to conduct themselves as they did, including
having regard to the fact that the plaintiff was then seeking an indulgence to
rely on the material at all.
is true that some of the defendants’ experts cannot, by reason of their
personal circumstances or availability, attend to
preparing reply reports in the
limited time remaining before the trial. That is beyond the plaintiff’s
control but also the
control of the defendants. But the reason why the
defendants are scrambling to prepare reply reports in this confined timeframe is
due to the plaintiff’s conduct in the first place. It is difficult to see
how the regrettable vacation of a trial in this
long-running proceedings was
other than brought about by the plaintiff’s conduct of the proceedings. I
do not consider it appropriate
to make orders in a form other than as sought by
the defendants in their motion and already made.
