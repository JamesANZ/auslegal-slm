Use of employees' personal information during training [2005] NSWPrivCmr 4 (1 January 2005)
Use of employees’ personal information during

obliged to have an up-to-date Privacy Management Plan. Agencies
required by law to provide copies of the plan to Privacy NSW.
employee of a medium size government agency, made an application for an internal
review under the PPIP Act to that agency, alleging
a breach of his privacy.
According to B, his personal details were provided without his consent to a
large number of his co-workers
as part of a training session on the
agency’s new personnel and payroll software.
The information in
question was projected onto a screen and provided as handouts. It included
B’s home address, telephone number,
banking details and other personal
information. It was obvious from B’s complaint that he had acquired a good
knowledge of
The agency’s reviewing officer, who occupied a senior
position in the agency, promptly wrote to both the Human Resources Manager,
had organised and conducted the training, and to B’s immediate supervisor
(to whom B complained initially).
The reviewing officer requested
detailed responses as to the circumstances of the conduct in question. Once the
responses were received,
the reviewing officer analysed them in preparing his
report and recommendations. In his response, the HR Manager acknowledged that
the use of B’s personal information took place but he sought to excuse his
conduct by the fact that it was not technically
possible to develop fictional
personal records to use in the training course and that a number of attempts
were made to seek B’s
permission to use his personal information in this
way. He further argued that, as many of those attending the training session
from the HR department, they would have had access to the information
displayed as part of their normal work.
The officer handling the review
was highly critical of this approach and believed it was inadequate. He felt it
was not appropriate
to argue that attempts were made to obtain B’s consent
and to then proceed on a course of action without such consent being
He also dismissed the HR manager’s argument about many of the course
participants being able to access the information
because of their employment in
the HR department.
The reviewing officer made reference to an HR
manager’s position being one of trust and that an HR manager should be

manager because it appeared that he was not familiar with the agency’s
The response from B’s immediate supervisor
was also found to be inadequate by the reviewing officer. Apparently the manager
did little more than acknowledge B’s complaint and then, some days later,
referred it ‘up’ for action. Eventually
B received written apologies
from his Section Manager. The reviewing officer considered that a more proactive
response would have

his recommendations the reviewing officer suggested that the agency’s
Executive undertake a number of remedial and punitive
steps. Firstly, the HR
Manager was to be formally counselled and a letter from the Executive,
indicating the seriousness of the privacy
breach, was to be placed on his
personnel file. Secondly, B’s supervisor was to be informally counselled
to take a proactive interest in the welfare of his staff.
Finally, B was to receive a formal letter of apology, signed by the Executive,
which advised him of the actions taken.
This case highlights the
advantages of agencies having a well-drafted Privacy Management Plan, which will
provide clear guidance for
management and staff in privacy related
