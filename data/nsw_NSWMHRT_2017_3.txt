DATE OF HEARING:
November 2017

1. The case of Mr Ellis was reviewed under the provisions of
section 46(1)
Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990
2. The Tribunal considered the documents listed in the Forensic Patient
Exhibit List.
3. Having regard to
sections 40
(a) – (c) of the
Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990

the evidence before the Tribunal at this review and, in
particular, the circumstances and considerations appearing below:
the Tribunal is
satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the present
arrangements for care, treatment and control
of Mr Ellis are necessary and
sufficient for the protection of Mr Ellis from serious harm and/or for the
protection of others from
serious harm.
The Tribunal
makes no further or other order in relation to the care, treatment and detention
of Mr Ellis and notes that the present
order or orders continue in

Davis of the Mental Health Advocacy Service. Also in attendance

CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSIDERATIONS
State, including the likelihood of any deterioration in mental state:
5. Mr Ellis is an Aboriginal man of 52. He has chronic schizophrenia,
diagnosed when he was aged 18, and alcohol and cannabis abuse
disorders (in
remission in a controlled environment). In 2010 the District Court found him
NGMI of two charges of separate aggravated
sexual offences (in late 2009). He
has been in custody since his arrest in 2009 and was transferred to the high
dependency unit of
the Forensic Hospital in 2012. At the time of this hearing,
he had very recently been transferred to a new ward in the hospital.
medication is now stabilised. Unfortunately, Clozapine was not a success as
within three weeks he became unwell with suspected
myocarditis which occurred
concurrently with pneumonia. He was hospitalised, and on return to the Forensic
Hospital, commenced on
Aripiprazole. He now constantly expresses his remorse for
the offences but refuses to accept any element of sexual intent which is
main obstacle to his progress. It is possibly a reaction of shame. He is
undertaking psychological therapy on his sexual difficulties.
He is in constant
6. The Psychiatry Registrar considered that Mr Ellis was already benefiting
from the more free environment of the new ward.
7. Questions were raised concerning a statement in the Nursing Report that Mr
Ellis was undertaking E3 leave.
The Tribunal has no record of this and
doubts its veracity. Staff of the Tribunal will write to the Nursing Staff to
clarify. Mr
Ellis has responded well to antipsychotic medication, and only has
mild thought disorder.
8. His daughter became angry over the phone as to why he had been in hospital
so long, and why she, as his primary carer, has never
been contacted or advised
by the hospital staff of her father’s progress. The Psychiatry Registrar
agreed to keep in touch
with her by phone.
Any relevant physical condition:
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Removal of vocal
cord nodule (2013)
Haemorrhoids
induced myocarditis (2016)
Current risk assessment for harm
or endangerment to self or others:
9. There is no evidence of problem sexual behaviour at other times in Mr
Ellis’s life, apart from the two charges of major offences
over a three
day period, at a time when he was experiencing severe psychotic symptoms. His
insight, willingness to engage in treatment,
demonstrated ability to report
early warning signs to the team, and therapeutic rapport are particular
Any significant developments since the last review are
summarised as follows:
10. The individual psychotherapy sessions have apparently assisted Mr
Ellis’s insight already. He has maintained a stable mental
February, he contributed well to an Art Therapy group.
Future plans in
relation to care, treatment or control of the person:
11. Mr Ellis dearly wishes to see and assist with his grandchildren. He would
like to be transferred to Bloomfield to be nearer to
his daughter. Transfer to
Bunya is not possible because of the nature of the index offences, but it is
possible that the team may
support transfer to Bloomfield at the next hearing if
the sexual issues can be overcome.
12. The Tribunal further determined that the next review under
will be held within six months.
