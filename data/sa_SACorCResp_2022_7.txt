WEEKES, Virginia Anne and FILES, Craig Malcolm - Inquest Number 91/2020 (0675/2020 & 0213/2019), Responses [2022] SACorCResp 7 (26 October 2022)
Weekes, Virginia Anne and Files, Craig Malcolm (Coroner White)
Recommendation 1
- SAAS undertake a documented longitudinal clinical
review on MPDS determinant 26 CO2 sick person abnormal breathing, to
the appropriateness of a Priority 3 response to this type of
Response from SA Health
A review of 12
months’ data including overrides and upgrades, and changes to assigned
priority was conducted. This review determined
if change was required to the
response priority by the MPDS Review Workgroup.
The MPDS Review
Workgroup recommendation was endorsed by the Clinical Dispatch Review
The MPDS Review
Workgroup recommended that no change occur, and determinant 26 CO2 remains a
priority 3.
Recommendation 2
- SAAS reconsider each of the
determinants currently allocated as a Priority 3 response in
acknowledgement of the actual average
response times recorded in 2020.
Response from SA Health
The MPDS Review
Workgroup conducted a review of all high-risk Priority 3 determinants, many of
which were based on Richard Larsen’s
report that was tendered at the
Coronial Inquest, as well as determinants identified within the Safety Learning
System (SLS) the
Adverse Events Program.
Additional data
analysis of MPDS determinants aligning to this recommendation was also

recommended some alterations to determinant responses, all of which were
accepted and endorsed by the Clinical Dispatch
Recommendation 3
- SAAS should reconsider the Tactical
Deployment Plan with particular respect to expanding the range of ambulances for
dispatch to
a 26 CO2. Secondly, SAAS should examine whether the tasking rules
need to change in order to achieve more flexibility in times of
Response from SA Health
A review and
update of the Tactical Deployment Plan in relation to this case has been
completed. This is a fluid document and continues
to be reviewed and
appreciated that ambulance services are increasingly extending the role that
they play in pre-hospital health provision and
the pathways of care that they
provide. Not all patients will get a traditional ambulance response and it is
important that SAAS
offers integrated, flexible care options through early and
effective triage of calls for assistance. An expansion of Virtual Care
Alternate Care Pathways and ambulance and hospital avoidance strategies have
been made available to SAAS clinicians with
a view to ensuring resources are
available to provide a response to requests for service.
introduced a number of strategies to address periods of increased demand to
avoid wherever possible, delayed responses with
consideration to some of the
external factors contributing to those delays.
As part of the
Surge Management Review, we have introduced strategies within our Emergency
Operations Centre (EOC) to support informed
patient decision, such as informing
the patient or caller if there are any delays, and referral to our clinicians to
discuss alternative
safe and appropriate travel options, and clinical care
Recommendation 4
- SAAS review the EOC clinician
call-back policy to ensure that a call-back request is submitted to the
clinicians with sufficient
time to ensure that contact is made before the end of
the target response period.
Response from SA Health
review of the Out of Criteria Call-back System (OOCC) has been conducted with a
new procedure (PRO-341) developed and approved
for use within SAAS. This
procedure has been developed to ensure appropriate system oversight of delayed
ambulance attendance.
OOCC are now
conducted by Emergency Medical Dispatch Support Officer (EMDSO) using the
Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS). Timeframes
for OOCC are:
– 30 minutes (un-dispatched primary P2 events)
– 60 minutes
– 60 minutes
– 60 minutes
Proactive event
review and scene contact by a clinician in the EOC can occur sooner where a
patient will benefit from review or clinical
Recommendation 5
- SAAS review and provide a
documented procedure for the management of call‑back requests to provide
guidance in relation to
the triage of the request queue to determine the most
appropriate order of action and, secondly, to ensure that requests remain active
and visible on screen until the call-back is definitively actioned. This is
consistent with the recommendation made by Richard Larsen.

Recommendation 6
- During times of increased demand,
SAAS ensures an Emergency Operation Centre clinician assists with dispatch
decisions to ensure
that those in need receive attention as a matter of
Response from SA Health
PRO-346 Exit
Scripting: Care Pathway and Demand Management Procedure defines strategies that
can be enacted to support demand, including
finding opportunities to reduce the
likelihood of a surge, as well as providing opportunity to assist managing
demand surges with
a Demand Clinician.
Interim PRO-354
Extreme Demand Dispatch Principles also provides a framework which supports
dispatchers decision making to identify
those patients at highest risk of
deterioration. This includes further stratification via the MPDS alphanumeric
code, as well as
clinician assessment and/or
Recommendation 7
- SAAS ensure that complete
addresses are available to be displayed to crew members on all screens within an
ambulance where the
address is displayed, and on their pagers.

‘landmark’ field has been added to the Dispatch Alert Screen which
pops up when a Unit is tasked to an event. This is
in addition to the normal
placement of the landmark details on the Dispatch Report.
This change has
been deployed to all Mobile Data Terminals (MDT).
SAAS have been
unable to include the additional detail on pagers.
Communication to

EOC via the Government Ratio Network
(GRN) if clarification is
Recommendation 8
- SAAS undertake a review of
operational escalation and response systems to maintain consistency in service
delivery during times
of increased triple zero calls, and/or ambulance response

The Capacity
Management Plan is available to be applied during times of increased service
demand or other operational pressure.

Recommendation 9
undertake an urgent review of ambulance resourcing within the metropolitan area
to identify current and future requirements
that will ensure patient safety,
consistency of service delivery and that all performance KPIs can be routinely
Response from SA Health
In alignment
with election commitments announced in March 2022, SAAS are undertaking an
operational growth plan that includes:
The recruitment
of 350 new Paramedics, Ambulance Officers, and Emergency Operations Centre
Construction of
5 new SAAS stations, upgrading of 10 stations and the rebuilding of 4
Delivery of an
additional 36 new ambulances.
Construction of
a new Emergency Operations Centre and State Health Control
Recommendation 10
- SAAS review the
management of call back requests to ensure that the EOC clinicians are provided
optimal systems-based support to
ensure that pending call back requests are
easily identifiable and are either actioned or called with a reason documented.
