owner noticed cracking in the walls of the building.
1998, Mr Basham decided to make a claim against the builder for rectification of
the defects. He discovered that the builder
was no longer resident in the area
and could not be located. A report from a structural engineer was commissioned.
Based on the report
of Mr Simpson of June 1998, Mr Basham considered the damage
to the dwelling to be a major structural defect. Classified as such,
could be the subject of an insurance claim for a period of up to seven years
after construction.
Fair Trading Administration Corporation investigated

entertain the appeal is argued in relation to time limits and the
power of the
tribunal to extend time

29(3) of the Fair Trading Tribunal Act which provides that "
the failure to
comply is to be treated as an irregularity and does not nullify the proceedings
unless the Tribunal otherwise orders"
It was also argued that under
section 27(6) of the Fair Trading Tribunal Act, the Tribunal has power to extend
