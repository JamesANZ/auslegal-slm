Summary of Appellant's Submissions
written submissions undated but received by the Tribunal on 23 July 2013 the
appellant submitted that there were the three principal
reasons why the Tribunal
should not order her to pay the respondent's costs.
first reason was that the law was not settled in the area, and it was in the
public interest to have greater clarification of
the Standard.
second reason was the personal qualities and circumstances of the appellant
herself, namely that she would suffer hardship if
she personally had to pay the
costs, given that she only worked 20 hours per week. She also submitted that she
had conducted herself
honestly at all times.
third reason was the nature of the respondent. It was submitted that because the
respondent was a public entity it would not be
burdened by not receiving the
benefit of an award of costs in its favour.
those reasons the appellant submitted that she not be ordered to pay the
respondent's costs.
Costs Rules
power of the Tribunal to make an order for costs is contained in s175B of the
National Law and clause 13 of Schedule 5D to the
Law. Section
175B provides:
The responsible tribunal may make any order about costs it considers
appropriate for the proceedings.
13 relevantly provides:
13 Tribunal may award costs [NSW]
(1) A Tribunal may order the complainant (if any), the registered health
practitioner or student concerned, or any other person entitled
(whether as of right or because leave to appear has been granted) at an inquiry
or appeal before the Tribunal to pay costs
to another person as decided by the
discretion to award costs was considered by the Medical Tribunal of New South
NSW Medical Board v Dinakar
[2009] NSWMT 8.
That decision
involved consideration of legislation (the
Medical Practice Act
(NSW)) in relevantly identical terms to clause 13. In its reasons for decision
that Tribunal stated:
42. A successful party to litigation has a “reasonable
expectation” of being awarded costs against the unsuccessful party:
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
[1998] HCA 11
dictates that the unsuccessful party typically bears the liability for costs:
at [134], unless it is demonstrated that some other order is
appropriate:
Currabubula Holdings Pty Ltd v State Bank of NSW
The presumption is based on the principle that costs are
compensatory, and applies to a Medical Tribunal:
Ohn v Walton
at 79; see also
Latoudis v Casey
(1990) 170 CLR 334.
43. It is for the losing party to establish any departure from the usual
Waterman v Gerling Australia Insurance Co Pty Ltd
[2005] NSWSC 1111
NSW v Stanley
[2007] NSWCA 330
However, the purpose of an order for costs is to compensate the person in whose
favour it is made and not to punish the person against
whom the order is made:
Allplastics Engineering Pty Ltd v Dornoch Ltd
[2006] NSWCA 33
Dr Douglas v Lawton Pty Ltd (no 2)
[2007] NSWCA 90
44. The discretion to depart from the usual rule is unfettered; however, a
tribunal ought not to exercise its discretion against
the successful party
arbitrarily or capriciously, or on no grounds at all:
The discretion must be exercised judicially, and “according to the rules
of reasons and justice, not according to
private opinion ... benevolence ... or
Williams v Lever
(1974) 2 NSWLR 91
at 95. Generally the
presumption will only be displaced where there is some sort of disentitling
conduct on the part of the successful

at 874. The disentitling conduct does not
necessarily need to amount to misconduct, and may simply be any conduct
‘calculated
to occasion unnecessary expense’:

note that in
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
(1998) 193 CLR 72
[1998] HCA 11
McHugh J explained the "important principle"
subject to certain limited exceptions, a successful party in
litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour. The principle
grounded in reasons of fairness and policy and operates whether the successful
party is the plaintiff or the defendant. Costs
are not awarded to punish an
unsuccessful party. The primary purpose of an award of costs is to indemnify the
successful party. If
the litigation had not been brought, or defended, by the
unsuccessful party the successful party would not have incurred the expense
which it did. As between the parties, fairness dictates that the unsuccessful
party typically bears the liability for the costs of
the unsuccessful
litigation.
(footnotes omitted)
should be made to three further authorities.
first is the decision of the Dental Tribunal of NSW in
HCCC v Roopra (No
[2013] NSWDT 3
where that Tribunal usefully, and at some length,
summarized at [50] the relevant principles as to the awarding of costs.
the Tribunal stated:
(b) A successful party to
litigation has a reasonable expectation of being awarded costs against the
unsuccessful party:
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
(1998) 193 CLR 72
[1998] HCA 11
NSW Medical Board v Dinakar
[2009] NSWMT 8
(c) Fairness dictates that the unsuccessful party typically bears the
liability for costs:
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
[1998] HCA 11
(1998) 193 CLR 72
[1998] HCA 11
Medical Board v Dinakar
[2009] NSWMT 8
(g) It is for the losing party to establish a basis for any departure from
the usual rule:
Waterman v Gerling Australia Insurance Co Pty Ltd (No 2
[2005] NSWSC 1111
NSW v Stanley
[2007] NSWCA 330
(l) In the absence of disentitling conduct by the successful party, the
Tribunal will exercise its discretion by compensating the
successful party
through an order for costs:
Health Care Complaints Commission v Howe
[2010] NSWMT 12
NSW Medical Board v Dinakar
[2009] NSWMT 8
second authority is the decision of the Medical Tribunal of NSW in
Care Complaints Commission v Chowdhury
[2010] NSWMT 16
where that Tribunal
stated at [9]:
The ordinary principles applying in a court apply to
the exercise of power to award costs under cl 13: see
NSW Medical Board v
[2009] NSWMT 8
- [45] referring to
Richmond River Council
[1998] HCA 11
(1998) 193 CLR 72
Ohn v Walton
(1995) 36 NSWLR 77
Caladine v The
Commissioner, New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission
[2007] NSWCA 362.
The applicable principle is, therefore, that
costs follow the event unless the circumstances of the case require the exercise
discretion to make a different order
(emphasis added)
we note that this Tribunal (differently constituted) has recently stated, in
Coe v Health Care Complaints Commission
[2013] NSWNMT 12
In summary, the principles or guidelines in dealing with costs
applications are:
normally in disciplinary proceedings, as in other civil litigation, costs
should follow the event unless the circumstances of the
case require, in the
exercise of discretion, not to do so (see
Ohn v Walton
(1995) 36 NSWLR 77).
This position is frequently
referred to as “the usual rule” or “traditional rule” in
respect of costs;
an award of costs is to compensate, in the form of a partial indemnity, the
person in whose favour it is made not to punish the person
ordered to pay costs;
the onus is normally on the “losing” or unsuccessful party to
establish any departure from the “usual” rule;
the discretion to depart from the “usual” rule is unfettered, but
must be exercised judicially (see
Oshlack; Williams v Lever
(1974) 2 NSWLR 91
at 95); and
generally the presumption the “usual” rule applies will only be
displaced where there has been some sort of disentitling
conduct on the part of
the successful party (see
Oshlack; Arian v Nguyen
[2001] NSWCA 5
summary therefore, the effect of the ordinary rule is that it is for the
appellant Ms Smith, as the unsuccessful party, to justify
why an order be made
other than one that she pay the Board’s
Consideration
first reason advanced by Ms Smith as justifying an order that she not have to
pay the Board's costs was that the law was not settled
in the area, and it was
in the public interest to have greater clarification on the Standard.
authority was cited for this submission. A similar issue arose in
the Nursing and Midwifery Board
[2013] NSWNMT 4.
Despite the Tribunal
finding that that appeal did involve complex issues relating to the
interpretation of the Standard, the appellant
was unsuccessful the Tribunal
determined that it was appropriate to order Ms Smith to pay the Board's costs.
Ms McMahon has subsequently
sought leave to appeal from that decision to the
Supreme Court of NSW. At the time of delivery of these reasons leave to appeal
not been granted, nor had an appeal been heard and determined.
addition, we note that the fact that proceedings could be characterised as
public interest litigation has been considered by McHugh
J to be irrelevant to
the question whether a tribunal should depart from the usual order that costs
follow the event:
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
(1998) 193 CLR 72
[1998] HCA 11
Even assuming that this is public interest litigation, or an application in the
nature of public interest litigation, a matter on
which we express no view, as
the respondent submits, any public interest in having the boundaries of the
Standard clarified does
not represent a reason to depart from the usual order as
second reason advanced by the appellant was that her personal qualities (that is
how she conducted the litigation, and her circumstances
(namely that she worked
only 20 hours per week) warranted a ruling that she not be ordered to pay the
respondent’s costs, notwithstanding
that she was the unsuccessful moving
party. Again no authority was cited for this proposition. Neither conducting
proceedings in
good faith, nor financial circumstances constitute a sufficient
reason to depart from the application of usual principles we have
referred to
namely a successful party to litigation has a reasonable expectation of being
awarded costs against the unsuccessful
party, and fairness dictates that the
unsuccessful party bear the liability for costs:
third reason was the nature of the respondent. It was submitted that because the
respondent was a public entity, it would not
be burdened by not receiving the
benefit of an award of costs in its favour. Again no authority is cited for that
submission. We
do not understand that the fact the Board is established to
perform a public function is a reason to depart from the usual approach
costs. The authorities in paragraph [15] above are all examples of this Tribunal
having made costs orders in favour of a public
the reasons given above, in addition to the order of 10 July 2013 dismissing the
appeal, the Tribunal orders the appellant to
pay the respondent's costs, as
the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement leave is granted to
restore the matter before the Tribunal for determination.
