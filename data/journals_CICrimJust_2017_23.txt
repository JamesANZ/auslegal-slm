What Went Wrong
With Money Laundering Law?

Introduction
What Went Wrong with Money Laundering Law
is a timely intervention.
The book is a continuation of Alldridge’s sustained concern about the
expansion of money laundering
regulations (Alldridge 2003, 2008). The monograph
is a short, engaging polemic that unpicks the assumptions underlying money
law and questions ‘what is wrong with laundering, and why, if
at all, it need be a crime’ (p. 2). As Alldridge notes
up-front, he does
not intend to provide a comprehensive account, but rather to critique the
unreflective enthusiasm in the United
Kingdom (‘UK’) and the
international community for the anti-money laundering/countering the financing
of terrorism project
(‘AML/CFT’). Although focused on the UK, the
monograph provides insight into the woes of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia
(‘CBA’) and the AML edifice. At time of writing, the CBA risks fines
of hundreds of millions of dollars after the federal
Government’s
Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre accused it of ignoring police
warnings to monitor suspicious
accounts, and failing to report tens of thousands
of transactions worth more than $500 million, in breach of money laundering and
terrorism financing laws.
Book structure
The monograph consists of two parts. The first part provides an introduction
and short history of what laundering looks like and the
development of the
anti-money laundering narrative. This part is highly successful and provides a
persuasive overview of the narratives
that have justified the massive
surveillance and enforcement program of the AML industry. Alldridge asserts that
there are two major
ideal images of laundering. The first, promulgated by the
Financial Action Task Force (‘FATF’), the United Nations, Global
Financial Integrity, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD
and the European Union presents laundering as ‘elaborate,
sophisticated,
glamorous and vague’ (p. 3). In contrast, the other image is
‘concrete, quotidian, easily comprehensible,
and difficult to regard as
global threat’ (p. 4). Alldridge points to the AMC Network’s
Breaking Bad
, where Saul explains to Jesse that he needs to invest in a
nail salon to acquire a legitimate cover. Interestingly, the recent Netflix
manages to embrace both images. Marty Bryde (played by Jason
Bateman) relocates with his family to the Ozarks region in Missouri
millions in cartel cash. While the cartel provides a threatening backdrop of
international drug smuggling, Bryde’s
actions are more prosaic, investing
in a derelict bar and petrol pump to launder his own money as a test. This idea
of shifting away
from abstract, unproven claims to criticisms based on concrete
examples informs the entire book.
The second part of the book focuses on the impacts upon substantive
laundering law. Alldridge returns to classic criminal law doctrine
that laundering could simply be regarded as a form of complicity. However, he
argues that for advocates of AML the idea
of complicity does not make laundering
bad enough to justify the AML edifice. The gravity of complicity is dependent to
some extent
at least on the gravity of the predicate offence that generates
profit. However, Alldridge argues that the AML narrative asserts
money laundering is serious. He suggests an alternative explanation for the
criminalisation of money laundering is to justify the
very onerous reporting
obligations required by the FATF. The FATF is an intergovernmental
standard-setting body that requires governments
to put in place investigatory
powers and punishments commensurate with very serious offences. Alldridge argues
it was necessary to
invent the ‘serious’ crime of laundering, that
is, ‘the tail wagged the dog’ (p. 38). He then goes on to
the legislation and case law in detail, including the difficulties of
calculation of confiscations of assets due to the
unclear underlying narratives.
Critique of anti-money laundering legislation
Like many criminal law theorists, Alldridge is concerned about the trend of
over-criminalisation (Brown 2013; Lacey 2004). He argues
that it is important
that the ‘considerations bearing upon the decision to criminalise or not
to criminalise be reassessed
at each step’ (p. 8), successfully applying
this argument to AML:
AML law has brought a very serious criminal offence into existence without a
clear idea of what is wrong with it. It has failed properly
to assess the nature
of the principle against allowing a criminal to benefit from his/her crime, and
in particular without clear
limiting principles based upon its application. It
has legislated at every level on the repeated but baseless assumption that
institutions are endangered by laundering. It has on successive
occasions allowed incremental expansion of that crime without appropriate
reassessments and it has afforded insufficient significance to the distinction
between crimes with and without victims (p. 33).
Alldridge argues that AML narratives are built on sand. In particular, there
is slippage between the crimes that are the specific
foci of the AML project.
Initially, in the 1970s and 1980s, the focus was on confiscating the profits of
drug dealers, although as
Alldridge notes, ‘even if one deplores the fact
that drug dealers profit from crime and wishes to confiscate those profits,
does not follow that one must necessarily be committed to the view that money
should be a crime’ (p. 10). Organised crime was
then relied upon to justify extraordinary measures to combat it. AML was, and
continues to be, justified in terms of protecting the financial markets.
Alldridge points out that ‘of all the crises and insolvencies
financial institutions from the crash of 2007–2008, none was as a result
of money-laundering’. The claim that
interventions are justified to
safeguard financial institutions are thus ‘fanciful and smacks of
policy-based evidence making’
(p. 13). Post-11 September 2001, AML was
justified to prevent the financing of terrorism, although the quest to identify
financing among the billions of dollars of global financial markets
was compared to ‘be akin to searching for an indistinguishable
amongst a stack of needles’ (Wolosky & Heifetz 2002, p. 3). AML has
also been justified in terms of corruption,
to which Alldridge responds:
Of course they are. The link could be claimed equally for any offence that
either yields money or requires money for its commission.
commentators’ claims are rephrased as ‘corruption and complicity in
corruption are intrinsically linked’
then the pleonasm becomes clear. This
is not to say that corruption is not a serious and a pernicious group of crimes
... Far more
needs to be done about, but hoping that AML will do the trick is
not the way ... Proceeds of crime law, and following-the-money,
is too much
This quotation demonstrates Alldridge’s demolition of underlying
assumptions about AML in a way that is persuasive and accessible.
For such a short book there is a surprising amount of repetition and
circularity — but this reflects the slipperiness and circularity
AML discourse. The first part of the book is highly accessible and would be of
interest to experts and general readers alike.
Alldridge provides ample
references to follow up on any points of interest. The second part of the book
is more technical and likely
to appeal to those with a pre-existing interest.
I very much enjoyed reading this book. It provides an important antidote to
the juggernaut of AML. However, despite his persuasiveness,
Alldridge’s
analysis implies that it may be too late to halt the reach of the AML
