the hearing on 7 August 2025, Taylor J, President communicated the
Commission’s intention to consider each application on
the papers, and
issue a judgment in chambers.
the reasons that follow, pursuant to s 227 of the Act, we cancel the
registrations of the Aged & Community Services Organisation
and the Leading
Age Services Organisation on the ground that each is
The Aged & Community Services Organisation
11 February 1991, the Aged & Community Services Organisation was registered
as an organisation of employers under the
Industrial Relations Act 1988
At registration its name was
“Voluntary Care Association of NSW and ACT
name of the Aged & Community Services Organisation was changed twice prior
to its registration under the IR Act:
(1) on 27 September 1991, to “Aged Services Association of NSW
& ACT”; and
(2) on 13 September 2001, to “Aged & Community Services
Association of NSW & ACT Incorporated”, being its present
name in the
register of industrial organisations kept for the purpose of the IR Act.
14 March 2003, the Aged & Community Services Organisation was
registered as a federal industrial organisation of employers
under Ch 5 of
the IR Act.
25 November 2013, the Aged & Community Services Organisation
registered as a company limited by guarantee under the
Corporations Act
(Cth). The Aged & Community Services Organisation was registered
Corporations Act
with the name “Aged & Community
Services NSW & ACT”.
Consequently,
on 9 December 2013, the Aged & Community Services Organisation
applied to the Fair Work Commission to change its
name to reflect its new name
Corporations Act
On 24 March 2014, Vice President Hatcher ordered that the name of the
Aged & Community Services Organisation be changed to “Aged
Community Services NSW &
However, the Aged &
Community Services Organisation’s name was never updated in the register
kept for the purpose of the
IR Act, although its new constitution and annual
reports were provided to the Industrial Registrar in 2015.
2015, the various state and territory-level industrial organisations operating
under the “Aged & Community Services”
brand agreed to centralise
their operations into, and establish, a single national organisation.
Consequently, on 17 December 2015,
Aged & Community Services Australia
(the Aged Peak Body) was incorporated as a company limited by
Aged & Community Services Organisation appeared in the State Wage Cases in
2015, 2016, and 2017. It ceased to appear in industrial
proceedings after 2017
and the Aged Peak Body appeared instead.
January to July 2017, Craig Bosworth was appointed by the Aged & Community
Services Organisation to be its Interim CEO
to, among other things,
“analyse, restructure and transition [the Aged & Community Services
Organisation] into a national
industry peak
organisation”.
Bosworth gave the following evidence as to events that occurred during his
tenure as Interim CEO:
(1) The Aged & Community Services Organisation transferred its “net
assets (after liabilities) to [the Aged Peak Body]”,
including the
“the tangible assets, contracts liabilities, and any intellectual property
or service rights”. This transfer
was affected in accordance with the Aged
& Community Services Organisation’s constitution and accompanied by
financial due diligence. After this transfer, the Aged & Community
Services Organisation ceased to hold assets.
(2) The members of the Aged & Community Services Organisation transferred to
the Aged Peak Body.
(3) The Board of the Aged & Community Services Organisation was dissolved,
leaving no officeholders of the Aged & Community
Services Organisation.
(4) The Aged & Community Services Organisation “became an
organisational arm or NSW division of [the Aged Peak Body]. It
no longer existed
as an independent entity”.
(5) The Aged & Community Services Organisation complied with its obligations
under the IR Act.
(6) The Aged & Community Services Organisation did not hold any elections.
6 April 2017, the Fair Work Commission made two decisions:
(1) registering the Aged Peak Body (on its own application) as an organisation
under the Commonwealth Act;
(2) cancelling the registration of the Aged & Community Services
Organisation (on its own application) under the Commonwealth
the hearing of the above proceedings before the Fair Work Commission, the Aged
& Community Services Organisation described
its application as follows
(emphasis added):
“At the moment we have [the Aged Peak Body], Aged and Community Services
National, and then there’s four state entities,
of which [the Aged &
Community Services Organisation] is one. They’ve all been working together
under a federated model
they agreed a while ago to form a new
national entity and then the state and the national entities would be
de-registered or wind
up and close up business
Subsequently,
the Aged & Community Services Organisation:
(1) on 6 December 2017, cancelled its GST registration;
(2) on 20 January 2018, voluntarily revoked its status as a charity;
(3) on 19 November 2018, cancelled its Australian Business Number;
(4) on 22 February 2019, was deregistered under the
Corporations Act

virtue of the incorporation provisions in the

application was then made to cancel the registration of the Aged & Community
Services Organisation or to register the Aged
Peak Body under the IR
The Leading Age Services Organisation
3 February 1994, the Leading Age Services Organisation was registered as a state
industrial organisation under the Act. At registration,
the Leading Age Services
Organisation’s name was "The Extended Care Industry Industrial
Secretariat, New South Wales Branch".
At registration, the Leading Age Services
Organisation was a state branch of the Extended Care Industry Industrial
Secretariat.
Leading Age Services Organisation’s name changed three times since its
initial registration:
(1) on 22 March 1996, to "Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association
(New South Wales)";
(2) on 2 June 2005, to "Aged Care Association Australia – NSW”;
(3) on 11 July 2012, to “Leading Age Services Australia NSW-ACT”,
being its present name in the register of industrial
organisations kept for the
purpose of the IR Act.
Leading Age Services Organisation’s most recent name change was in
response to an agreement reached among several state
and territory-level
organisations to merge and establish a unified peak body for providers in the
aged care sector. This involved:
(1) each of the state and territory-level organisations changing its name to
adopt the “Leading Age Services” brand;
(2) on 17 April 2012, the incorporation as a company limited by guarantee of
Leading Age Services Australia Ltd (the Leading Peak
Leading Peak Body was not registered under the Commonwealth Act nor the IR
Australia informs the Commission that each of the several state and
territory-level organisations under the “Leading
Age Services”
brand, including the Leading Age Services Organisation were to be deregistered
and their operations unified into
the Leading Peak Body. Other state and
territory-level organisations were deregistered following the creation of the
Leading Peak
Body, but the Leading Age Services Organisation remained in
prior to the unification of each of the state and territory-level organisations
under the “Leading Age Services”
brand into the Leading Peak Body,
the Leading Peak Body would jointly appear with each of those state and
territory-level organisations.
For example, the first listed respondent in
Application by
Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and
Services Union
the “Aged Care Employers”, a group of entities including, among
others, the Leading Peak Body, the Leading Age Services
Organisation, and
several state and territory-level organisations that adopted the “Leading
Age Services” brand.
Australia informs the Commission that the last industrial activity it can
identify that was undertaken by the Leading Age Services
Organisation was in
2016 in the Fair Work Commission’s 4 yearly review of modern
On 25 November 2014, the
Leading Age Services Organisation filed an appearance in that proceeding. In a
decision in that proceeding
on 10 October 2016, the Fair Work Commission
referred to a group described as the “Aged Care Employers”. The
Care Employers” had made joint submissions to the Fair Work
Commission. That group included, among others, the Leading Age
Organisation and the Leading Peak Body, and several state and territory-level
organisations that adopted the “Leading
Age Services”
By the time of the Fair
Work Commission’s decision in that proceeding on 3 December 2018, the
“Aged Care Employers”
included the Leading Peak Body, but did not
include the Leading Age Services Organisation nor any state and territory-level
organisation
that had adopted the “Leading Age Services” brand.
Australia informs the Commission that the Leading Age Services
Organisation’s last appearance in a proceeding that it
can identify was in
Leading Age Services Australia
where Walton J made
orders in respect of invalidities that had occurred in connection with the
alteration of the Leading Age Services
Organisation’s rules on terms of
office and the filling of casual vacancies.
Leading Age Services Organisation’s GST registration was cancelled
effective from 1 January 2017.
Leading Age Services Organisation’s Australian Business Number was
cancelled effective from 30 June 2017.
Australia informs the Commission that, from 2016, the Leading Age Services
Organisation operated as a division of the Leading
Peak Body, and ceased
operating as a separate employer membership organisation.
Australia contends that the Leading Age Services Organisation transferred its
assets and its members to the Leading Peak Body
during the period following the
creation of the Leading Peak Body. Ageing Australia puts this on the basis
(1) the history of the Leading Age Services Organisation, that is, its rebrand
to “Leading Age Services”, and its participation
with several other
organisations to create the Leading Peak Body;
(2) the records of several other state and territory-level organisations which
rebranded and subsequently deregistered;
(3) the joint appearances of the Leading Age Services Organisation with the
Leading Peak Body, which ceased in or about 2016;
(4) the ongoing representation of the interests of the members of the Leading
Age Services Organisation by the Leading Peak Body
(i.e., implying that the
Leading Peak Body took over the representation of the members of the Leading Age
Services Organisation);
(5) the cancellation of the Leading Age Services Organisation’s GST
registration and Australian Business Number.
Bosworth, formerly the Manager, Employment Relations at the Leading Peak Body
between January 2020 and September 2022 (now
Head of Workplace Relations at
Ageing Australia), gave evidence of behalf of Ageing Australia that:
(1) when she commenced at the Leading Peak Body, “[the Leading Age
Services Organisation] no longer existed as an employer
association ... Rather,
[the Leading Peak Body] was a national employer association that had members
across the country, including
(2) the Leading Peak Body had offices in most states, including in NSW;
(3) she does not have a copy of the Leading Age Services Organisation’s
(4) she is unaware if the Leading Age Services Organisation was wound down in
accordance with its rules;
(5) the Leading Age Services Organisation does not have any current members;
(6) the Leading Age Services Organisation is not engaging in any industrial
relations activities;
(7) the Leading Age Services Organisation no longer occupies office space at
Level 8, 418A Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills, NSW, 2010;
(8) the website previously maintained by the Leading Age Services Organisation
is no longer in operation;
(9) no steps were taken for the Leading Age Services Organisation to hold
elections or file records with the Industrial Registrar
during her tenure;
(10) she is not aware of the last occasion on which the Leading Age Services
Organisation filed records with the Industrial Registrar;
(11) the last known President of the Leading Age Services Organisation was
Robert Orie.
Separately,
on 18 September 2014, the Fair Work Commission cancelled the registration of the
Extended Care Industry Industrial Secretariat
on the ground that it was
As set out above, this
was the national industrial organisation of which the Leading Age Services
Organisation was a state branch
at the time of its
registration.
Ageing Australia
2016, there were two peak bodies operating in the aged care sector, being the
Aged Peak Body, and the Leading Peak Body. These
peak bodies were
competitors.
29 April 2022, the Aged Peak Body and the Leading Peak Body each held a special
general meeting. During each meeting, each organisation
voted to merge into a
newly established aged care industry association, being Ageing Australia.
Consequently,
on 3 May 2022, Ageing Australia was registered as a company limited by
19 December 2022, the Aged Peak Body and the Leading Peak Body each entered into
a deed with Ageing Australia for the transfer
of each organisations assets,
members, and liabilities to Ageing Australia for no consideration.
6 July 2025, the Aged Peak Body and the Leading Peak Body were each
deregistered.
Australia has not registered as an organisation under either the Commonwealth
Act or the IR Act.
Australia submits that the effect of the above is that it has taken over the
operations, assets, liabilities, and members of
each of the Aged & Community
Services Organisation and the Leading Age Services
Organisation.
Relevant principles
5 of the IR Act deals with the regulation of industrial organisations in NSW.
Chapter 5 of the IR Act grants the Commission
important supervisory powers with
respect to industrial organisations. For example, the Commission is empowered
(1) register organisations (upon which State organisations will be
incorporated);
(2) cancel, alter the rules of, or suspend an organisation (including on the
Commission’s own
initiative);
(3) grant exemptions in respect of requirements for elections held by State
organisations;
(4) permit the alterations of the rules of a State
organisation;
(5) declare that the rules of a State organisation contravene the requirements
set out in the IR Act;
(6) direct that a person performs or observes the rules of a State
organisation;
(7) inquire into and make various orders in respect of irregularities in an
election held by a State
organisation;
(8) enforce the membership provisions in the IR Act (e.g., order that an
applicant be admitted as a member of a State
organisation);
(9) deal with proceedings in respect of the breach of the duties and liabilities
owed by officers of State
organisations;
(10) grant or refuse disqualified persons leave to hold office in State
organisations;
(11) make orders validating certain acts done by State
organisations;
(12) order the reconstitution of, or appointment of an administrator to, a State
organisation;
(13) initiate elections for the officers of a State organisation;
(14) make demarcation orders in respect of an industrial
organisation.
5 of the IR Act also places various obligations on industrial organisations. For
example, industrial organisations are required
to keep and lodge various records
once a year with the Industrial
above history demonstrates that the two organisations have been defunct for some
years. While these applications to cancel the
registration of each of the Aged
& Community Services Organisation and the Leading Age Services Organisation
ought to have been
made much earlier it is nevertheless commendable that they
have now been made. It is undesirable that defunct industrial organisations,
that are no longer complying with their statutory obligations and no longer
representing industrial interests, remain registered.
consideration of these applications has been able to be completed efficiently
and on the papers because the Commission was provided
with affidavits that
provided the following evidence, to the extent it was available:
(1) proof of service of the application for cancellation and the notice of
listing of any hearing before the Commission on the industrial
organisation and
its last known office holders;
(2) the rules of the industrial organisation;
(3) whether the industrial organisation resolved in accordance with its rules to
approve of the application for cancellation;
(4) whether the office-holders (or last known office-holders) of the industrial
organisation approve of the application for cancellation;
(5) whether the industrial organisation has been complying with its obligations
under the IR Act to file its records with the Industrial
Registrar and hold
elections, and if not when it last did so;
(6) whether the industrial organisation is engaging in any industrial relations
activities (or any activity), and if not, when it
last engaged in such
(7) whether the industrial organisation has any members;
(8) the steps that have been taken by the members of the industrial
organisations to approve of the application for cancellation;
(9) if the industrial organisation does have existing members, whether those
members would suffer any disadvantage from cancellation;
(10) whether notice has been given to any interested persons, or if there has
been any public advertisement of the application for
cancellation;
(11) a statement of the assets and liabilities of the industrial organisation;
(12) the consequences of cancellation on the assets and liabilities of the
industrial organisation.
provide that list for the benefit of future applicants for the cancellation of
the registration of industrial organisations which
should ensure, to the extent
possible, that evidence of the above matters is before the Commission. To the
extent evidence is unable
to be provided of the above matters, the reason why
that evidence cannot be provided should be explained.
2 of Part 3 of Chapter 5 of the IR Act sets out the circumstances in which the
Commission may cancel the registration of
an industrial organisation.
Relevantly:
(1) with the Commission’s leave, a person with “sufficient interest
in the matter” may apply to cancel the registration
of an industrial
organisation;
(2) the Commission may cancel the registration of an industrial organisation if
it “considers that a ground for cancellation
established”;
(3) the registration of an industrial organisation may be cancelled on the
ground “that the organisation is

opportunity to be heard by the Commission in any proceedings

organisation is required to be heard by a Full Bench of the
Commission in Court
is not defined in the IR Act. “Defunct” carries its ordinary
meaning, that is, “no longer
operative; not in
Commission and the Supreme Court of NSW have previously found that one or more
of the following circumstances support a finding
that an industrial organisation
is defunct:
(1) it has wound up in accordance with its rules and transferred its assets to
another entity;
(2) it no longer has any assets and
liabilities;
(3) it no longer has any effective industrial or other
(4) it has failed to respond to correspondence from the Industrial
(5) it has failed to lodge records returns with the Industrial Registrar;
(6) it has failed to conduct
(7) it is no longer operative or has no prospect of ever being operative again
(e.g., by reference to holding no elections, no meetings
of governing bodies, or
no members).
the reasons that follow, we are satisfied that:
(1) Ageing Australia has a sufficient interest in these matters pursuant to
s 225(1) of the IR Act;
(2) each Organisation has been given an opportunity to heard pursuant to
s 225(4) of the IR Act; and
(3) a ground to cancel each Organisation’s registration has been
established, namely, that each Organisation is defunct.
Consideration
Sufficient interest
are satisfied that that Ageing Australia has sufficient interest in these
matters pursuant to s 225(1) of the IR Act because it
is the successor of
the interests, members, and assets of each Organisation.
the above summary of the evidence demonstrates, succession was brought in two
stages. First, the Aged Peak Body and the Leading
Peak Body were established to
take over the various state and territory-level organisations including each
Organisation. Second,
Ageing Australia was established to take over the Aged
Peak Body and the Leading Peak Body.
Accordingly,
we grant leave for Ageing Australia to make each application pursuant to
s 225(1) of the IR Act.
Opportunity to be heard
are satisfied that each Organisation has been given the opportunity to be heard
pursuant to s 225(4) of the IR Act.
Australia has taken the following steps to give each Organisation the
opportunity to be heard:
(1) the application for cancellation of the Aged & Community Services
Organisation, together with the listing details for the
hearing before the
Commission on 7 August 2025, was sent by post to the registered address of the
Aged & Community Services Organisation,
the PO Box of the Aged &
Community Services Organisation and to Craig Bosworth (the former CEO of the
Aged & Community Services
Organisation), and by email to Raad Richards (a
former Board Member of the Aged & Community Services Organisation) and Craig
Bosworth (the former CEO of the Aged & Community Services Organisation);
(2) the application for cancellation of the Leading Age Services Organisation,
together with the listing details for the hearing
before the Commission on 7
August 2025, was sent by post to the registered address of the Leading Age
Services Organisation and by
post and email to Robert Orie (the last known
President of the Leading Age Services Organisation); and
(3) information about each application and the listing details for the hearing
before the Commission on 7 August 2025 was published
in the Sydney Morning

that he would not seek to be heard by the Commission.

The Aged & Community Services Organisation
are satisfied that the Aged & Community Services Organisation is defunct for
the following reasons.
it no longer exists as a body corporate under either the Commonwealth Act or the
Corporations Act
. This was brought about by the cancellation of its

Its last records were lodged in 2015.
it no longer has any effective industrial function, its functions being taken

Leading Age Services Organisation
are satisfied that the Leading Age Services Organisation is defunct for the
following reasons.
the functions of the Leading Age Services Organisation were taken over by the
Leading Peak Body (and in turn taken over by
Ageing Australia). The Leading Age
Services Organisation agreed to merge with several state and territory-level
organisations into

the Leading Age Services Organisation has not engaged in industrial activity
since 2016. The Leading Age Services Organisation
has no effective
the Leading Age Services Organisation has not held elections or lodged records
with the Industrial Registrar since, at least,
with the Aged & Community Services Organisation, there is no direct evidence
before the Commission of the transfer of the
Leading Age Services
Organisation’s members and assets to the Leading Peak Body. Ms Bailey
(formerly Manager, Employment Relations
at the Leading Peak Body) gives evidence
that on her employment at the Leading Peak Body in January 2020, the Leading Age
Organisation “no longer existed as an employer
association”, instead the Leading Peak Body operated nationally including
for members in NSW. On the material that has been able to be put before the
Commission, and in the absence of any contradictor, we
are content to accept the
submission of Ageing Australia that the Commission should infer that the members
and assets of the Leading
Age Services Organisation were transferred to the
Leading Peak Body (and ultimately Ageing Australia) upon the “unification
of the LASA State/Territory organisations into the national peak body” in

However, pursuant to
s 228(3) of the IR Act, the Leading Age Services Organisation:
(1) does not thereby cease to be an unincorporated organisation; and
(2) the Commission may, on application, make orders in relation to its debts and
obligations; and
(3) its property (if contrary to our understanding, it has any) is the property
of the unincorporated organisation and is required
to be held and applied for
the purposes of the organisation under the rules of the organisation so far as
they can still be carried
out or observed.
