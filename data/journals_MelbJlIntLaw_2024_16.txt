“What?! Is there even law in space!?” Many a space law scholar
has encountered this question, though increasingly less
so as literacy on the
existence of space law permeates the broader community, not least through a
private sector with a burgeoning
interest in minerals, travel and other
“star” attractions. “Space is lawless, the wild, wild
west”: another
(fundamentally) incorrect but too common refrain, which
tends to elicit a range of reactions from space law experts, none of whom
particularly pleased. The
Magna Carta
of space — the
Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of
Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial
makes clear that activities in space are to be conducted in accordance with
international law. Space is
res communis
. The exploration and use of
outer space is to be free, in the interests of all countries and not subject to
a claim of national sovereignty.
The Moon and other celestial bodies are to be
used only for peaceful purposes. States are prohibited from placing weapons of
destruction in Earth’s orbit or outer space and the militarisation of
celestial bodies is forbidden. Nation-states are internationally
responsible for
national space activities and internationally liable for damage caused by their
space objects. However, as activities
in space increase in complexity, frequency
and intensity, existing legal frameworks are being
Can we mine the moon? If
so, who gets to benefit? What happens if we establish settlements on Mars? Which
nation-state is responsible
for those communities? Which nation-state’s
laws govern who?
For this reason — and others — a 2024 book from Oxford University
International Space Law in the New Space Era: Principles and
edited by Sandeepa
Bhat B, Dilip Ukey and Adithya Variath, is a welcome resource. The book includes

The book is an edifying dive into examples of key issues in space law,
including the five key treaties and other fundamentals, such
as demarcation,
state responsibility, liability and registration. It also considers topical
issues, such as the future of the

The authors
are well-chosen for the topic, each bringing a particular lens of experience to
their contribution. Of course, domestic
laws and constitutional arrangements are
also an important part of the body of rules and principles constituting
regulation of space
but, for understandable reasons, this volume focuses on
space law in the international context.
The question of law in space is particularly relevant because human activity
in space is increasing. For example, the United Nations
Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (‘UN COPUOS’) has grown from 24
member states in 1959 to 102 members as
It is also fair to say that
the space sector has experienced an ‘innovation-driven paradigm
relevance for many aspects of human life, not least because remote sensing
technologies can be usefully applied to health,
agriculture, environment,
disaster management, education, transportation, communication and humanitarian
assistance.
Space is no longer the
domain of science fiction, but instead a source of key dependencies. This is not
least because
our current activities and habits are dependent on space-based services.
Every time you use a GPS map on your smartphone, or use your
bank card or phone
to make a transaction, you are using satellite data. Civil aviation and shipping
rely on satellite position, navigation
and timing (PNT) systems like GPS.
Internet, TV, and many other forms of telecommunication are often
satellite-based. Checking the
weather forecast uses the same satellite data that
is used to track climate change, wildfires, cyclones, and floods. Disaster
technologies all use satellites. As do the stock market, traffic
regulation,
agricultural applications, and objective tracking of environmental, social and
governance (ESG) metrics for
businesses.
A state’s capability to reach beyond terrestrial confines also
symbolises its technological advancement and innovation, positioning
top of the world’s technological pecking order and affirming the
worthiness of its values and policies. These demonstrations
of technical prowess
are sources of national pride. The competition for space supremacy is therefore
not only a matter of advancing
defence systems and dual-use technologies, but
also of hearts and minds. It’s a race for soft power. In short, human
in space has significant consequences for national security and global
politics. Law and regulation in space, therefore, matter.
Space is also no longer the exclusive domain of Cold War geopolitics and it
is no longer a trichotomy between China, Russia and the
United States. Space is
burgeoning in the Indo-Pacific, for example. Indonesia established the
Indonesian Space Agency in 2022 and
issued new government regulations to control
and protect space technology, safety standards and public participation in the
South Korea has launched
satellites into orbit using its own rockets, making it the seventh nation to
have successfully launched
a greater-than-one-ton payload on an indigenous space
launch vehicle.
Thailand and
Vietnam have made strides through collaborations with the French
government.
‘mu-Space’ start-up opened Thailand’s first spaceship factory
and Thailand was one of the first Southeast
Asian countries to launch its own
Earth Orbit (‘EO’)
Vietnam has also
launched an EO satellite of its own — VNREDSat-1 — to better
monitor and study the effects of climate
change and natural disasters and to
optimise natural resources
management.
Taiwan has announced
a USD800 million investment to develop its space sector over the next decade,
including launching 10 locally
made satellites into space by 2028 and the
development of a launch site.
Similarly, in November 2024 Japan signed off on the establishment of a USD6.7
billion 10-year fund for its space agency to support
development of satellites,
space exploration and space
transportation.
New Zealand is
rapidly expanding its space-based capabilities since the establishment of its
national space agency in 2016.
Other Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and
Singapore have launched a series of micro-satellites,
mostly products of
research and development through joint government-academia
cooperation.
And while the first space race between the two Cold War great powers may be
over, a second race back to the Moon is well underway
with a greater number of
contenders in play, leading to legal questions around resource extraction, state
responsibility, space debris
and the status of private citizens in space. There
is also a plethora of human rights issues raised by human activity in outer
from the question of access and the right to enjoy and benefit from
technological and scientific advancement to fundamental questions
In terms of layout,
International Space Law in the New Space
opens with an introduction to space law and some of the key
mechanics, such as demarcation, institutional roles and the key treaties.
moves on to focus on the
Moon Agreement
and the increasingly important
role of soft law in governing the conduct of states. Chapters on the
, dispute settlement and secured transactions law are also included.
The book concludes with an offering on ‘Third World Approaches’
term used in the
This book is an excellent resource for a reader looking to understand the
fundamentals of international space law while gaining insights
into a diverse
range of issues in the current context of debate. For example, the chapters on
demarcation,
registration,
Moon Agreement
provide both historical context and a sense of the key debates — and do so
deftly. The chapter on state responsibility is a
useful addition to the
literature because it examines the topic of state responsibility through the
lens of space,
rather than the
other way around, which is what existing literature on the topic has tended to
do. There are also chapters that provide
useful insights into institutional
mechanics, which are generally not well-understood. For example, the chapter on
the contribution
of the United Nations to the development of space law offers
useful explanations of the role of the legal subcommittee of the UN
with another chapter
focusing on the role of the International Telecommunication
Many chapters in this
book also tackle — at various points — the relationship between
space law and international law
more generally, including the relevance of
lex specialis
principles in navigating that relationship. Cumulatively,
this is a useful endeavour and an important addition to existing
scholarship.
The chapters can be read alone and are not dependent on one another. One
consequence of this, however, is that the introductory sections
of chapters are
at times repetitive. Perhaps this was by deliberate design. However, readers
might have benefited from better cross-referencing
between chapters and from the
authors demonstrating a greater engagement with one another’s chapters.
This would have also
aside, each chapter does a good job of linking foundational doctrine with
debates to equip a reader with important space law literacy. The chapters are
well-written and the contributor list showcases
a diverse range of views. There
is not a standalone chapter on human rights law and space but, of course, it is
impossible to include
chapters on all topics.
Of the 17 contributing authors, six are women, equating to a gender balance
of around 35% women to 65% men, which is an improvement
on all-male line ups of
the past and better reflects the growing number of excellent women scholars and
practitioners with expertise
in space law. The contributors also reflect a
reasonable engagement with different regions, although it would have been
to read a chapter from a Southeast Asian author, not least given
burgeoning interest in space from the region, including in Indonesia
Thailand. However, in fairness, the book is not intended as a comparative study,
but rather a resource introducing some of the
key issues in international space
law for times such as ours and it certainly does that very well. The chapter
‘Third World
Approaches to International Space Law’ is excellent
but, of necessity, did a lot of heavy
The inclusion of an
additional chapter in this vein might have allowed for a more pluralised,
nuanced and diverse navigation on North-South
and East-West divides. This should
not detract in any way from the virtues of each contribution.
There are other important resources available on international space law,
The Woomera Manual on the International Law of Military Space
Activities and Operations
international research project that is spearheaded by the University of
Adelaide; the University of Exeter; the University of
Nebraska, Lincoln; and the
University of New South Wales, Canberra. The
Woomera Manual
specifically
seeks to articulate the law applicable to military activities associated with
the space domain. There is also work being
undertaken on the
McGill Manual on
International Law Applicable to Military Uses of Outer Space,
from McGill University in Canada.
Of course, these are not normative
works and, while very useful, have a specific mandate limited to the law on
armed conflict.
There are, of course, other edited volumes available on international space
law, such as the

could also delve into the individual academic works of authors such as Michelle

However, almost no other book on the market at present showcases such a
diverse range of contributions — in terms of discipline
and geography
— and moves between both history and the contemporary with such ease as
the contributing authors in this volume
do. For this reason and others,
International Space Law in the New Space Era
is an excellent resource
that is informative, engaging and contemporary. It makes a worthy contribution
to the field and to the way
we should be thinking about space and is a
recommended addition to the library of any legal scholar or policymaker with an
