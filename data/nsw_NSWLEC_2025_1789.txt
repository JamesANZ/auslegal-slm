COMMISSIONER
This Class 1 appeal is brought under
Environmental Planning and
Assessment Act 1979
(NSW) (EPA Act) following development consent granted by
Wingecarribee Shire Council on 4 March 2025 for development application
DA25/0560 for a boundary adjustment and consolidation of three existing lots
into two resultant lots at 421 Myra Vale Rd, Wildes
Meadow NSW 2557 (the
consent granted by the Council approved the DA, subject to certain deferred
commencement conditions to which the Applicant in
this matter, Mr George Couri,
this end, on 28 July 2025, the Applicant filed an appeal with the Court,
appealing against the imposition of deferred commencement
condition (4) at
Schedule 1 of the conditions of consent to the DA.
31 October 2025, the Court arranged a conciliation conference between the
parties in accordance with
Land and Environment
Court Act 1979
(NSW) (LEC Act), at which I presided.
to the conciliation conference, the parties reached agreement
on the matters in contention, and a signed agreement was filed
the Court on 20 October 2025, in accordance with s 34(10) of the LEC Act.
parties ask me to uphold the appeal and grant conditional development consent to
the development application according to terms
set out in the s 34 agreement
before the Court. In general terms, the agreement approves the development
subject to amended plans
that were prepared by the Applicant, and noting that
the final detail of the works and plans are specified in the agreed conditions
of development consent annexed to the s 34 agreement.
s 34(3) of the LEC Act, I must dispose of the proceedings in accordance with the
parties’ decision if the parties’
decision is a decision
that the Court could have made in the proper exercise of its functions. The
parties’ decision involves
the Court exercising the function under s
4.16 of the EPA Act to grant consent to the development application. There
are jurisdictional
prerequisites that must be satisfied before this function can
be exercised.
the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that the parties’ decision
is a decision that the Court could have made in the
proper exercise of its
development application, lodged on 3 October 2024, is supported by written
consent of the owner. The Council advertised the development
application between
17 and 31 October 2024, in response to which one submission was received.
site is located within an area identified by the Wingecarribee Local
Environmental Plan 2010 (WLEP), as C3 Environmental Management
in which the
proposed subdivision and boundary adjustment is permitted with consent.
minimum lot size standard applies to the area. The relevant map at cl 4.1(2) of
the WLEP prescribes a minimum lot size of 40 ha
as shown on the WLEP Lot Size
Map, and cl 4.1(3) of the WLEP provides that the size of any lot resulting from
a subdivision of land
to which cl 4.1 applies, is not to be less than the
minimum size shown on the Lot Size Map. Relevantly, the proposed Lot 1 does not
comply with the minimum lot size prescribed by cl 4.1(2) of the WLEP, having an
area of 10.12 ha. However, cl 4.2B of the WLEP provides
an exception to cl
4.1(3) of the WLEP and allows subdivision that results in a lot below the
minimum lot size, provided certain exceptions
parties agree, and I am satisfied, that consent may be granted to the proposed
development in accordance with cl 4.2B(3) for the
reasons that follow:
(1) Firstly, the development proposes a decrease in the number of lots, being
three lots into two lots, satisfying cl 4.2B(3)(a)
of the WLEP.
(2) Secondly, the development application proposes no increase in the number of
dwellings that may be erected on any of the lots,
beyond that which is already
approved, and noting the yurt building located on proposed Lot 2 has been
decommissioned, satisfying
cl 4.2B(3)(b) of the WLEP.
(3) Thirdly, the development application does not result in a lot that is less
than 2 hectares, satisfying cl 4.2B(3)(c) of the WLEP.
Additionally,
the parties provide the following evidence that those matters that are required
to be considered at cl 4.2B(4) of the
WLEP have been considered:
(1) The proposed development does not alter the existing uses of surrounding
land, as both proposed Lot 1 and Lot 2 are suitable
for residential use without
affecting neighbouring properties, and will not impact the predominant land use
in the area being a rural
precinct with residential dwellings;
(2) The proposal is not incompatible with the adjoining land use zones, as both
sides of Myra Vale Road are mapped Zone C3 Environmental
Management and will not
result in any conflicts with existing or permitted land uses and no specific
measures are needed to avoid
incompatibility;
(3) Finally the proposal will not adversely affect the environmental values or
agricultural viability of the land, maintaining its
potential for future
development or small-scale agricultural use; and will not result in any negative
visual impacts to the surrounding
4.2A of the WLEP also applies to the Site as the DA includes an approved
building envelope that relates to consent DA20/0331
granted by the Court in
Lasovase Pty Ltd v Wingecarribee Shire Council
[2021] NSWLEC 1316
June 2021, for the erection of a dwelling on Proposed Lot 1.
cl 4.2A(4)(a) of the WLEP, development consent may be granted for a new dwelling
in the C3 Environmental Management zone if
it replaces an existing, lawfully
erected dwelling. In this case, the proposed dwelling approved by DA20/0331,
replaces the existing
Yurt building, that has been decommissioned.
agreed conditions of consent require the modification and surrender of consents
granted prior, the decommissioning of the yurt
building and the physical
commencement of the consent cited at [
this basis, I am satisfied that the DA and those conditions of consent, satisfy
all jurisdictional matters required to be considered
under the WLEP.
State Environmental Planning Policy (Resilience and Hazards)
have considered whether the land is contaminated in accordance with s 4.6 of
State Environmental Planning Policy (Resilience and
Hazard) 2021. On the basis
of the long history of agricultural use associated with the site, I am satisfied
the site can be made
suitable for the purpose for which development is proposed
to be carried out.
State Environmental Planning Policy
(Biodiversity & Conservation) 2021
site is located within the Sydney Drinking Water Catchment. As such Ch 6 of the
State Environmental Planning Policy (Biodiversity
and Conservation) 2021
(Biodiversity SEPP) applies to the site.
the DA seeks consent for a paper subdivision only, I accept that the proposal
does not impact the regulated catchment, water quantity,
quality or aquatic
ecology of surrounding waters or have any adverse impacts under Ch 6 of the
Biodiversity & Conservation SEPP.
Biodiversity Conservation
Site is identified as land containing Biodiversity Values on the Biodiversity
Values Map and Threshold Tool. However, for reasons
that are virtually identical
with those at [
am satisfied that the DA is for a paper subdivision only and no vegetation
clearing is proposed. Therefore, the biodiversity
offset scheme threshold under
Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016
(NSW) is not triggered
Rural Fires Act 1997
the Site is mapped as bushfire prone land and the Proposed Development is
classified as a Special Fire Protection Purpose under
Rural Fires Act 1997
(NSW), the Applicant relies
on a Bushfire Hazard Assessment, dated 25 September 2024, prepared by
Harris Environmental Consulting.
proposal was referred to NSW Rural
Fire Service (RFS), and a Bushfire Safety
Authority issued 22 October 2024, incorporated in
conditions of consent.
the parties’ decision is a decision that the Court could have made in the
proper exercise of its functions, I am required
under s 34(3) of the LEC Act to
dispose of the proceedings in accordance with the parties’ decision.
making the orders to give effect to the agreement between the parties, I was not
required to, and have not, made any merit assessment
of the issues that were
originally in dispute between the parties.
Court orders that:
(1) The appeal is upheld.
(2) Development Application DA25/0560 for the boundary adjustment and
consolidation of three lots into two lots at 421 Myra Vale
Road, Wiles Meadow
NSW 2577, is determined by a grant of consent subject to conditions set out in
Annexure A to this agreement.
