REASONS FOR DECISION
6 November 2008 Mr B Hatch, Senior Member
This is an application for review which was lodged on 15 February 2008 in
relation to a decision of Ms C J Skelton, delegate of the
Commissioner for ACT
Revenue, dated 17 December 2007.
2. The decision under review of the delegate is in relation to a first home
owner’s grant. The grant totalling $14,000 was
paid on 7 January 2003
pursuant to the
First Home Owner Grant Act 2000
The delegate made a decision that the applicant was not entitled to the grant
because settlement of the property had not been completed
prior to giving of the
grant and therefore that the sum of $14,000 should be repaid. The delegate also
imposed a penalty of 75%
of the grant amount, that is, 75% of $14,000, pursuant
to section 47 of the FHOG Act. Interest then accrues at the rate of 14.37%
annum until the amount is repaid in full.
3. On 3 September 2001 the applicant applied for a grant under the First
4. The delegate of the Commissioner approved the grant by way of letter
dated 29 November 2001. It was a condition of the grant
that if settlement did
not proceed on 31 December 2002, then a further 20 days was allowed in which
settlement could take place.
If settlement did not take place within that
period, then the grant of $14,000 was repayable.
5. It is not in dispute that settlement did not take place until 15 October
2004 some considerable time after 31 December 2002.
6. At the time of the grant and the approval of the grant, section 21 of the
FHOG Act stated:
21 Conditions generally
(1) The commissioner may authorise the payment of a first home owner grant
on conditions the commissioner considers appropriate.
(2) A condition imposed by the commissioner (under this section or any
other provision of this Act) may require a person on whose
application the first
(a) to give notice of noncompliance with the condition within a period
stated in the condition; and
(b) to repay the grant within a period stated in the condition.
(3) For a joint application, each applicant is individually liable to
comply with a requirement under subsection (2) but compliance
by any of them is
to be regarded as compliance by all.
(4) If a first home owner grant is paid to a person on a condition imposed
by the commissioner under this section or another provision
of this Act, the
person must comply with the condition.
Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units.
7. At the time the grant under the Act was made it was subject to the
residence requirements under the FHOG Act. Section 12 at the
time of the grant
was as follows:
12 Criterion 5─Residence requirement
(1) An applicant for a first home owner grant must occupy the home to
which the application relates as the applicant’s principal
residence within 1 year after completion of the eligible transaction or a longer
period approved by the commissioner.
(2) The commissioner may exempt an applicant (the
noncomplying
) from the residence requirement if─
(a) the applicant is one of 2 or more joint applicants for a first home
owner grant; and
(b) at least 1 of the applicants complies with the residence requirement;
(c) there are, in the commissioner’s opinion, good reasons to exempt
the noncomplying applicant from the residence requirement.
8. Thereafter the residence requirement was altered. It is not necessary
for me to set out those residence requirements as I find
that the residence
requirement as set out above in section 12 at the time of the grant is the
relevant residence requirement. The
applicant was required to occupy the
property as his principal place of residence within one year of settlement. As
settlement occurred
on 15 October 2004 then residence was meant to occur within
one year of 15 October 2004.
9. Section 47 of the FHOG Act makes provision for payment of penalties and
interest. Section 47 and section 48 state as follows:
47 Power to require repayment and impose penalty
(1) The commissioner may, by written notice, require an applicant (or
former applicant) for a first home owner grant to repay an amount
paid on the
application if—
(a) the amount was paid in error; or
(b) the commissioner reverses the decision under which the amount was paid
for any other reason.
(2) If, because of an applicant’s dishonesty, an amount is paid by
way of a first home owner grant, the commissioner may, by
the notice in which
repayment is required or a separate notice, impose a penalty of not more than
the amount the applicant is required
(3) If an applicant (or former applicant) for a first home owner grant
fails to make a repayment required under this section or the
conditions of the
grant, the commissioner may, by written notice, impose a penalty of not more
than the amount the applicant is required
(4) If an amount is paid in error on an application for a first home owner
grant to a third party, the commissioner may, by written
notice, require the
third party to repay the amount to the commissioner.
48 Interest in relation to repayments
(1) A person is liable to pay interest under this section on the amount of
a first home owner grant paid to the person if the amount
is repayable under
section 20 (2) (b).
(2) A person is liable to pay interest under this section on an amount
paid to the person on an application for a first home owner
grant if the amount
is repayable under section 47.
(3) Interest under this section is to be calculated on a daily basis
(a) if the amount is repayable under section 20 (2) (b)—the relevant
date as defined in section 20 (3); or
(b) if the amount is repayable under section 47 (1)—the date the
amount was paid to the applicant.
(4) For this section, the interest rate is the interest rate mentioned in
Taxation Administration Act 1999
section 26.
10. When determining whether a penalty is to be imposed the considerations
were set out by the President in
Taskovski and Commissioner for ACT
[2007] ACTAAT 11
(25 May 2007):
38. The power to impose a penalty is contained in section 47(2) and
section 47(3) of the Act provided that the conditions contained
within either of
those provisions are met. The amount of the penalty in either case is, subject
to the fixing of a maximum amount,
within the discretion of the Commissioner.
The exercise of the discretion is required to be made by reference to the
subject matter,
scope and purpose of the legislative scheme pursuant to which
the decision-making power is to be exercised (
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs
v Peko-Wallsend Limited
[1986] HCA 40
(1986) 162 CLR 24).
39. The adoption by the Commissioner of guidelines of the kind contained
in the schedule referred to in paragraph 22 above is well
recognised as a means
of focussing the attention of a decision-maker on relevant considerations and
better achieving consistency
in decision-making provided that the guidelines are
consistent with the statute conferring the decision-making power and do not
the proper exercise of the discretion conferred or prevent individual
cases from being properly considered on their merits (
Re Drake and Minister
for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs (No 2)
[1979] AATA 179
(1979) 2 ALD 634).
apparently mere departmental guidelines without legislative status, however, the
schedule is relevant only as forming part of
the background of facts of which
the Tribunal ought to be informed when making its decision (
Re Lumsden and
Secretary, Department of Social Security
(1986) 10 ALN N225).
acknowledged as sometimes necessary to the administration of a large department,
the Tribunal should take a guarded approach
to their application (
Secretary, Department of Social Security
(1987) 11 ALD 440).
40. A list of the useful factors which a court might take into account in
determining the amount of a civil penalty was developed
by the Australian Law
Reform Commission following an analysis of considerations adopted by the courts
in imposing civil penalties
under the Trade Practices Act and Company Law (See
Principled Regulation: Federal and Civil Administrative Penalties in Australia
(2002) ALRC 95).
Those factors were adopted by the New South Wales
Administrative Decisions Tribunal in considering the amount of penalty to be
under the New South Wales equivalent provision to section 47 of the
Calcaro v Commissioner for State Revenue
[2004] NSWADT 158).
Those factors, which I accept as appropriate, included:
(a) the deterrent effect of the penalty;
(b) the nature and extent of the contravention;
(c) any loss or damage suffered, or gain made, as a result of the
contravention;
(d) the circumstances in which the contravention took place including the
deliberateness of the conduct and the period over which
it extended;
(e) whether professional advice had been obtained in relation to the
contravention, prior to the breach;
(f) whether the person has previously been found by a court to have
engaged in any related or similar conduct;
(g) the degree of cooperation with the authorities; and
(h) in the case of a natural person, the attitude of the offender.
11. During the hearing of this matter, the applicant gave evidence. The
applicant began this matter by stating that he would not
give evidence. He
started by way of making submissions and thereafter gave sworn evidence. I had
the opportunity of seeing the
applicant give evidence both in chief and in
cross-examination over three days due to his evidence being interrupted by the
for other witnesses to be called. Having seen the applicant and
having heard his evidence, I do not regard the applicant as a witness
Having seen and heard the applicant, I consider that he would have and probably
did say anything at all which he considered
would support his claim to keep the
$14,000 and to obfuscate any issue which would assist the truth.
12. The applicant gave evidence that from about August 2004 he began to live
at the property the subject of the grant as his principal
place of residence. I
do not accept that. The applicant’s sister was called to give evidence.
The applicant’s sister,
Susanne Davey, gave evidence that she visited the
applicant at the subject property at various times during late 2004. Whether
attended at that property is not relevant to the view I formed which is that
the applicant’s sister was either completely wrong
in her assessment of
where her brother lived or that she was not telling the truth. By way of
example, Ms Susanne Davey gave evidence
that she attended at the subject
property to see her brother in August 2004 and helped him set up his wardrobes,
and set up the house
as a home. According to other evidence such as the
electricity company there was no power to the property at that time. It seems
unlikely that Ms Davey would overlook in her evidence that sort of fact. In
conclusion, I do not accept what Ms Davey has to say.
13. Evidence was also given in support of the applicant by Mr Haswell. Mr
Haswell gave evidence that he is an interior designer
and designed the interior
of the subject property. His evidence was that, in his experience, the nature
of the interior decoration
was not of a standard which would suggest that the
property was to be rented, but was of a higher standard by which he would expect
the owner to live in the property. He gave evidence that in August 2004 he
recalled that he attended at the subject property and
the applicant was living
there and using a mattress in the bedroom as his bed. He also gave evidence
that he had dinner with the
applicant at the subject property on one occasion
and on another occasion met the applicant at the subject property and had a
with him there.
14. Once again as the evidence is that electricity was not connected to the
subject property prior to September 2004 I cannot accept
the evidence of Mr
Haswell that he saw the applicant living there in August 2004. Living in such a
property without electricity
would have been something which someone would have
remarked upon. This evidence also contradicts the evidence of Ms Davey that in
August 2004 she helped her brother set up his house. I cannot accept that Ms
Davey would not mention that this included her brother
sleeping on a mattress on
15. The applicant gave evidence which at times was both extraordinary and
audacious. In relation to why the money was not repaid
when he went past the 20
days after the proposed settlement the applicant gave evidence that he spoke to
a woman employed at the
Commissioner’s office and that he was told that he
need not be concerned and the Commissioner did not want the money repaid
time. I do not accept that such a conversation took place. I do not accept the
applicant’s evidence in relation to
how the subject property ended up
being leased. The applicant gave evidence that the first tenant was obtained
through a real estate
agent by the name of Kathy. It is difficult to know
whether that evidence occurred to the applicant at the time he was giving it
whether he thought of it prior to taking his oath. The submission of the
respondent was that this evidence should be disregarded
as it had never been
raised before in any way. The documents filed in this matter support the
respondent’s submission that
this evidence had never been raised before
the hearing. I once again do not accept what the applicant has to say in this
16. The respondent questioned the applicant in relation to his tax returns.
The thrust of this seemed to focus on how the applicant
was treating the subject
property for the purposes of his income tax returns. It was being suggested by
the respondent that the
applicant may have been declaring to the Federal
Commissioner of Taxation that the subject property was simply an investment
and therefore he was able to receive some beneficial tax treatment as a
result. Such a tax return would have dealt a nasty blow
to the prospects of the
applicant in these proceedings. Of course, a tax return which showed the
opposite would have assisted the
applicant greatly in showing that the property
was simply a place which he always intended calling home. Counsel for the
asked the applicant squarely whether he was prepared to get those tax
returns and tender them in evidence. The applicant refused
to do that. I
conclude that the tax returns would not have assisted the applicant’s
17. The evidence of the applicant was that in 2004 he intended moving into
the subject property and he in fact did so for approximately
49 days. That
however coincided with a period during which he had disputes with his business
partners. This caused considerable
disruption to his business together with the
need to raise funds to buy out one of his business partners. I accept the
of the applicant that he had considerable business difficulties during
that time because this evidence is supported by other evidence,
restraining order issued by the Magistrates Court involving the applicant and
his business partner. I do not accept that
he moved into the subject property
as his principal place of residence. I do not accept that he thereafter had to
move out in order
to be able to rent out the property so that he could afford to
pay out his business partner. I consider that the business dispute
has become a
convenient backdrop to help explain why the subject property was never his
principal place of residence.
18. Having heard all of the evidence in this matter, I affirm the decision
under review. I do not do this easily as it may have
been open to me to
determine that the penalty should have been 100% of the grant rather than 75%.
There is some merit, however,
in bringing this matter to resolution by affirming
the decision rather than interfering with it.
