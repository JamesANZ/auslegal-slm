REASON FOR DECISION:
The transaction in relation to this claim
occurred on or about 9 May 1998, and the first indication of financial loss came
notice of the Applicants in March 2001.
Until 30 June 2001, the relevant Act was
Auctioneers and Agents Act
1971 (the Repealed Act) and claims against
the Auctioneers and Agents Fidelity Guarantee Fund established under the
Repealed Act
(“the former fund”) were made under Section 119 of the
Repealed Act until it was repealed.
The Property Agents and Motor
Dealers Act 2000
”) came into effect on 1 July
2001 and the Applicants made a claim to the Chief Executive under Section 604 of
the Act on 21
February 2002.
The Chief Executive advised the Applicant
by a Claim out of Time Notice dated 19 March 2002, issued under section 472 of
, that their claim was out of time. The claim was said to be out
of time pursuant to the provisions of Section 472 of the Act, which

no appearance on behalf of the First and the Second
Respondents.
Written submissions were filed by Ms
Teitzel at the hearing and by Mr Morgan on 10 May
10. The submissions by the Applicants were
substantively the same as those made to Mr Gallagher, Acting Chairperson, in
Hosking v NAPC and Ors
, PAMDT W011-02 5 April 2002 and I am in agreement
with what was said by Mr Gallagher in
in relation to each of
those submissions
11. As Mr Gallagher said in
essential question is whether the Applicants could have made a claim against the
former fund before the commencement of the Act
on 1 July 2001, pursuant to the
transitional provisions contained in Section 604(3). If they could have, then
they can make a claim
against the claim fund established under Section 408 of
the Act. If they could not have, then there is no valid claim before this
12. The Tribunal adopts and endorses what Mr Gallagher said in
On a consideration of all of this material, I am
satisfied the time limitation provisions contained in Section 119 of the
Act (and those in Section 472 of the Act) define the right to claim set
out by those provisions and are part of the definition of
the new rights created
by the relevant legislation. The time limits are an element of the cause of
action. In these circumstances,
I am satisfied that the time limitations in
question confine the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. As such, I reject the
submissions
relying on Hoogland’s case and the Mayne Nickless case and am
satisfied that if the Applicants could not have made a claim
under Section 119
of the Repealed Act then there is no valid claim before the Tribunal because the
cause of action has been extinguished.
It cannot be revived by commencing Court
proceedings and then invoking the provisions of Section
The Effect of the time provisions of
Section 119 of the Repealed Act
13. Sub-section 119(5) of the
Repealed Act set time limitations for bringing a claim against the former fund
and provided as follows:
The notice must be given
(a) 6 months after the person becomes aware that the person has
suffered pecuniary loss; or
(b) 3 years after the commission of the breach
that caused the person’s pecuniary loss;
whichever occurs
14. There is no dispute that in this case the alleged
contravention said to have caused the Applicants’ pecuniary loss occurred
on 9 May 1998 which means that the claim should have been made by 9 May 2001 if
the three year period were the period under consideration.
It is also not
disputed that the date the Applicants became aware of the alleged financial loss
was March 2001 so that notice of
the claim should have been given by September
2001 if the six months limitation were the period in question.
earlier date is 9 May 2001 and, therefore, I am satisfied that the Applicants
could not have made their claim under Section
119 of the Repealed Act after that
date except if they made it under sub-section (6A) of Section 119. However, this
date gave them
two months from the time the first indication of financial loss
came to their notice in March 2001. No explanation was offered for
16. The Repealed Act did not provide for an extension of time to
bring a claim other that in sub-section (6A) which provided as
Despite subsection (5), for a claim of the relevant
limit or less, the
registrar may accept a notice after the time that would
otherwise apply under
subsection (5) if the committee consents to considering
17. Sub-section (9) provides the following definition of
“relevant limit”:
“relevant limit”
means the larger of the
following amounts—
(a) $7 500;
(b) an amount prescribed under a
regulation.
18. I shall leave consideration of sub-section (6A) for the
19. In compliance with the time limitations of the Repealed Act,
the Applicant had until 9 May 2001 to claim under (5)(b), and based
evidence they did become aware that they had suffered a pecuniary loss in March
20. The Tribunal notes that after becoming aware of the loss within
time for lodging a claim, the Applicants did not complete and
lodge a claim on
the fund until 21 February 2002
No explanation was offered for this
21. However, on 9 May 2001 the Repealed Act was in force and
sub-section (5) required the Applicants to have given notice of their
May 2001 and except by way of sub-section (6A) it made no provision for
extending time beyond that date for the full amount
of their claim.
22. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that by 1 July 2001 when the
came into force the Applicants could no longer make a claim against the
former fund except under sub-section (6A) of the Repealed
now necessary to consider the Applicants’ application for an extension of
time to bring their application in relation
to sub-section (6A) of the Repealed
24. The Tribunal adopts and endorses what Mr Gallagher said in
The result is that, despite a failure to make a claim
within the times stipulated in Section 119(5), a claim for $7,500 or less could
be accepted if the committee consented to considering the claim. A difficulty
with this provision is that the “committee”
is a reference to the
former Auctioneers and Agents Committee constituted under the Repealed Act and
that committee no longer exists.
In my opinion, the transitional provisions
contained in Section 604 of the Act make it clear that an examination must be
to whether a person could have made a claim against the former fund
under the provisions of Section 119 of the Repealed Act. I am
therefore, that some effect must be given to Section 119(6A). I think it is
implicit in the provisions of Section 604
of the Act, particularly the
provisions of subsection (1) that the rights and liabilities of the former fund
are taken to be the
rights and liabilities of the new claim fund and the
provisions of subsection (3), that this Tribunal can give the required consent
to considering the claim, similar to its power under Section 511 of the Act to
extend time. I find support for this conclusion from
Section 451(1) of the Act
which states that the Tribunal “may do all things necessary or convenient
to be done for, or in relation
to, exercising its jurisdiction”. In
short, I am satisfied that I can consent to considering the Applicant’s
to the relevant limit of $7,500.
25. The Tribunal is satisfied
that Section 510 has been complied with.
26. The Applicants applied to
the Tribunal within the fourteen (14) days allowed under Section
27. On that basis the Tribunal is satisfied that Sections 510
and 511(1)(a) have been complied with.
28. However, under the
circumstances where the first indication of financial loss came to the notice of
the Applicants in March 2001
and they had until 9 May 2001 to file a claim but
delayed doing so for a total of 11 months and have not explained the reasons for
the delay, the Tribunal considers it is not appropriate to extend
29. An alternative submission was that, prior to 27 June 2000, the
Applicants could have applied under Section 7 of the Repealed Act
regulation to be made exempting them from a provision of the Repealed Act.
Section 7 was repealed by the
Equity and Fair Trading (Miscellaneous
Provisions)
Act 2000. However, the submission relied on
Section 20(2)(c)
Acts Interpretation Act
. It argued that the Applicants’
right to seek such a regulation was not affected by the repeal of
that they should therefore be given the opportunity to seek an exemption in
respect of the operation of Section 119(5) of the
Repealed Act. Ms Teitzel
tendered the Auctioneers and Agents (Exemptions) Amendment Regulation (No.2)
1997 as an example of such
a regulation.
30. The Tribunal adopts and
endorses what Mr Gallagher said in
and rejects this
submission.
31. The Tribunal also rejects this submission on the basis
that the Tribunal is required to interpret the law as at the time of the
hearing. It is completely inappropriate for the Tribunal to adjourn a matter to
enable a claimant to seek to have a Regulation made
which would then exempt the
claimant from a provision of the Repealed Act.
32. Having considered all
of the submissions, the Tribunal, for the reasons set-out above, dismisses the
