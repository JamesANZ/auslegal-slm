Statement of Heydan Spence
Spence provided a statement dated 3 August 2023.
worked for Emerald Grain from approximately 8 October 2016 to 17 December 2016
as a casual harvest worker. He stated harvest runs
from October for three to six
months. His duties including operating hoppers, transfer/storage, loading and
unloading of cereals,
bunker maintenance and raking. Mr Spence states he had a
good working relationship with his supervisor Sandy Newman, and he formed
expectation of working with Emerald Grain in the future.
March and July 2017 Mr Spence worked for Peter Salvestro as a tractor driver or
operating plant and equipment.
April 2017 Mr Spence stated he saw Ms Newman when she confirmed there would be
work available for the upcoming harvest and she
would call him when the harvest
mid-2017 Mr Spence failed to secure a full-time position at Emerald Grain but
was advised by Ms Newman that he was still welcome
to work the harvest.
before the harvest started Mr Spence was contacted by Ms Newman and secured
harvest work from 21 October 2017 to 15 December
2017 and for one week in
February 2018. In addition to the duties worked the previous year Mr Spence also
operated a stacker, drove
tractors, and undertook site maintenance/slashing. Mr
Spence stated he did not work between 6 and 17 November 2017 due a foot injury.
Mr Spence stated during this period he asked if he could operate the front-end
loader telehandler and skid steer. Ms Newman advised
he would have to be trained
on site by an assessor and she would let him know when the assessor would be
attending so he could be
trained. Mr Spence stated he anticipated doing the
training the following season.
15 and 28 February 2018 Mr Spence worked for Armstrong’s driving a water
truck to keep the dust down.
April or May 2018 Mr Spence saw Ms Newman. He asked if there was any work at
harvest time and she said she would contact him. In
September 2018 Emerald Grain
wrote to Mr Spence to say there was no work available for the 2018 harvest
due to drought.
Spence worked with ACAR between November 2019 and March 2019 as a leading hand
supervising contract workers on an almond farm.
May 2019 Mr Spence spoke to Ms Newman. He said, “I bet you can guess what
I am going to ask you”. She replied “We
don’t have work at the
moment, but you can do harvest and there might be some pre-harvest work
available. I’ll contact
you when it starts.” Mr Spence says he
understood from that conversation that he had an arrangement to work for Emerald
for the 2019 harvest.
Spence was injured in the accident on 12 August 2019 rendering him unfit for
14 August 2019 Mr Spence received a text message from Ms Newman to say she was
looking forward to having him back. Mr Spence advised
he had two broken legs.
Spence states on 15 October 2019 Ms Newman sent him a text message asking if he
could attend the induction that day. Mr Spence
stated he was still unfit due to
his injuries. Ms Newman asked Mr Spence to let her know when he was fit to

an email addressed “To Whom it May Concern” dated 9 August 2022
Sandy Newman, Training Coordinator stated:
“I met Heydan in
Coles in the first half of 2019.
We had a short catch up as Heydan had previously worked for us during
I asked Heydan if he was interested in joining us for harvest again for the
upcoming season. Heydan stated he was available and would
apply when it was
advertised later that year.
We were very sorry to hear about Heydan’s accident and really missed
him that harvest as it was a big year for us.
Heydan had been interviewed for a full-time position in 2017 which he was
unsuccessful for.
A full-time employee left the business while Heydan was injured, so he could
not be considered for the position.”
an email to the insurer dated 29 November 2022 Sandy Newman, Training
Coordinator stated:
“Heydan Spence would have been employed
by Emerald Grain for the below hours for harvest in 2019 and 2020 had he been
of working.
There were various permanent advertisements that Heydan would have been
eligible to apply for in this period also.
Harvest 2019
October 2019 would have been the start date for harvest and
harvest ended 20
December 2019. The average was 6 days a week
– 10 hours a day.”
letter dated 18 September 2019 addressed to Mr Spence signed by Ms Newman as
Site Manager – Goolgowi confirms an offer of
employment as a casual
employee from time to time. Attached to the letter was a contract of employment.
The commencement date is
21 October 2019, and the end employment date is 28
February 2020 or earlier. The job description is as a harvest casual country
employee with the Supply Chain and Operations and the reporting
responsibility is to the Site Manager – Goolgowi.
RELEVANT LEGISLATION
3.3 of the MAI Act deals with an injured persons entitlement to weekly payments
of statutory benefits.
3.6 and 3.7 sets out an entitlement to weekly payments calculated with reference
to the “pre-accident weekly earnings”.
1 of the MAI Act sets out the definitions relating to “earner” and
“pre-accident weekly earnings”
for the purposes of statutory weekly
payments under Division 3.3.
1, cl 2 of the MAI Act provides:
“Meaning of
A person who is injured as a result of a motor accident is
an earner if the person is at least 15 years of age and who—
(a) was employed or self-employed (whether or not full-time)—
(i) at any time during the 8 weeks immediately preceding the motor accident,
(ii) during a period or periods equal to at least 13 weeks during the year
immediately preceding the motor accident, or
(iii) during a period or periods equal to at least 26 weeks during the 2
years immediately preceding the motor accident,
and, at the date of the motor accident, had not retired permanently from all
employment, or
(b) before the motor accident, had entered into an arrangement (whether or
not an enforceable contract)—
(i) with an employer or other person to undertake employment, or
(ii) to commence business as a self-employed person,
at a particular time and place, or
(c) was, immediately before the motor accident, receiving a weekly payment or
other payment in respect of loss of earnings under this
Compensation Act 1987
1, cl 4 of the MAI Act provides:
“Meaning of
‘pre-accident weekly earnings’--general
(1) ‘Pre-accident weekly earnings’, in relation to an earner who
is injured as a result of a motor accident, means the
weekly average of the
gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during the 12 months
immediately before the day on which
the motor accident occurred, unless
subclause (2) applies.
(2) In the following cases,
’pre-accident weekly
in relation to an earner who is injured as a result of a
motor accident, means--
(a) if, on the day of the motor accident, the earner was earning continuously,
but had not been earning continuously for at least
12 months--the weekly average
of the gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during the period from
when the earner started
to earn continuously to immediately before the day of
the motor accident,
(a1) if the earner was employed or self-employed during a period or periods
equal to at least 26 weeks during the first year of the
pre-accident period, but
was not obtaining earnings from any source at any other time during the
pre-accident period--the average
weekly gross earnings received by the earner as
an earner during the first year of the pre-accident period,
(b) if subclause (3) applies--the weekly average of the gross earnings the
earner received as an earner, or could reasonably have
been expected to receive,
during the 12 months after the change of circumstance referred to in the
subclause occurred,
(c) if the earner is an earner by reason of having entered into an arrangement
with an employer or other person to undertake employment
or to commence business
as a self-employed person--the average weekly gross earnings that the earner
could reasonably have been expected
to earn, but for the injury, in employment
under that arrangement.
‘pre-accident period’
, in relation to a motor
accident, is the period of 2 years immediately preceding the motor
(3) This subclause applies if, during the 12 months immediately before the
day of the motor accident, there was, as a result of any
action taken by the
earner, a significant change in his or her earnings circumstances that resulted
in the earner regularly earning,
or becoming entitled to earn, more on a weekly
basis than he or she was earning before the change occurred.
Examples of a change of circumstances to which this subclause
would apply include a change of job, a promotion, a move from part-time
full-time employment, or a pay increase arising from the achievement of
performance standards.
(4) For the purposes of this clause, an earner earns continuously if he or
she obtains earnings from permanent employment or from
a source that, on the day
of the motor accident, was likely to continue for a period of at least 6 months
to provide earnings to
the earner on the same, or a similar, basis to the basis
on which the earnings were being provided as at that day.”
DECISION OF MERIT REVIEWER MEDLAND
Reviewer Medland issued a certificate and reasons for decision dated 11 December
Reviewer Medland stated the parties agreed Mr Spence was an “earner”
for the purposes of Div 3.3 of the MAI Act.
There was a dispute as to which
provision of cl 2 of Schedule 1 of the MAI Act applies.
insurer argued the claimant was an earner under cl 2(a)(ii) of Schedule 1 on the
basis he was employed for a period of 13 weeks
in the year immediately preceding
the accident.
Spence submits that he was an earner under cl 2(b)(i) of Schedule 1 on the basis
that he had entered into an agreement to undertake
employment with Emerald
Reviewer Medland found that the claimant was not an earner under cl 2(a)(ii)
where he had not worked with ACAR for a period
of 13 weeks in the year
immediately preceding the accident but had only worked for 11 weeks.
Reviewer Medland found that the claimant was an “earner” under cl
2(b)(i) on the basis at the time of the accident
he had entered into an
arrangement with an employer to undertake employment.
Reviewer Medland agreed with the submission for the claimant that cl 4(2)(c) of
Schedule 1 should be applied in calculating
the PAWE on the basis the clause
specifically refers to the earnings under the agreement and does not state the
earnings should be
averaged over a 12-month period.
Reviewer Medland calculated the likely earnings with Emerald Grain over 8.57
weeks at $16,946 or a PAWE of $1,97736.
SUBMISSIONS
Insurer submissions
insurer provided submissions dated 19 September 2023 in response to the initial
merit review application. The insurer notes the
claimant’s application is
made on the basis:
(a) he had previously engaged in casual contracts with Emerald Grain during the
harvest season, since 2016;
(b) he had a future agreement to work with Emerald Grain in the harvest season
following the accident, and
(c) he was unable to undertake work with Emerald Grain as a result of the injury
he sustained in the accident.
insurer submitted that the evidence demonstrated that the claimant:
(a) had not worked for and been paid for work by Emerald Grain since February
2018 and therefore had not worked for Emerald Grain
in the 12 months prior to
the accident;
(b) had not worked for and been paid for work by Bindara Management Services
since April 2017 and therefore had not worked for Bindara
Management Services in
the 12 months prior to the accident, and
(c) had not worked for and been paid for work by Ramps Ridge since June 2017 and
therefore had not worked for Ramps Ridge in the
12 months prior to the accident.
insurer applied Schedule 1, s 2(a)(ii) of the MAI Act to find that the claimant
was an earner on the basis he was employed for
a period of 13 weeks in the
“year immediately preceding the motor accident”. Whilst the insurer
concedes it raises no
issue in this regard, it notes there is no evidence of
earnings with ACAR between 10 December 2018 and 16 December 2018 and
28 January 2019 and 3 February 2019, meaning the evidence only
establishes the claimant worked 11 weeks in the year preceding the
insurer submits it had applied the correct test to determine whether the
claimant was an “earner” and in calculating
insurer provided amended submissions dated 9 November 2023.
Relevantly,
the insurer submits according to the email from Sandy Newman of Emerald Grain
dated 29 November 2022:
(a) the claimant “would have been employed by Emerald Grain” during
the 2019 and 2020 harvest, had he been capable of
working, and
(b) the 2019 harvest lasted for eight weeks (21 October 2019 to 20 December
2019) working 6 days a week, 10 hours per day).
insurer submits in assessing PAWE the claimant does not satisfy the definition
of an “earner” within Schedule 1 cl
2(b)(i) or (iii). The insurer
submits it has correctly applied Schedule 1 cl 2(b)(ii) of the MAI Act
(a) the claimant’s payslips demonstrate that the claimant was employed for
a total of 16.5 weeks during the 23-month period
to March 2019;
(b) there is no evidence the claimant was employed during the eight-week period
prior to the accident to satisfy the requirements
of Schedule 1 cl 2(a)(i);
(c) there is no evidence the claimant was employed “during a period or
periods equal to at least 26 weeks during the two years
immediately preceding
the motor accident” to satisfy Schedule 1 cl 2(a)(iii) where payslips only
confirm employment for 13.5
weeks during this period;
(d) the claimant has not provided any evidence that Ms Newman had the authority
to make an offer of a casual contract;
(e) despite the apparent offer of a casual contract of employment by Emerald
Grain the 2019 harvest season only lasted eight weeks.
The insurer submits the
claimant has not provided any evidence that Sandy Newman of Emerald Grain had
the authority to offer a casual
contract, notwithstanding the wording of her
email. Further the insurer submits there is no evidence the claimant entered
contract or agreement “before the motor accident” or that
he had prior to the accident “entered into an arrangement
(whether or not
an enforceable contract)” to work for Emerald Grain. The insurer notes the
contract post-dates the accident
and it was a case of “wait and see”
to determine if the harvest required workers, and
(f) the email from Sandy Newman dated 9 August 2022 did no more than invite the
claimant to apply for a potential position.
insurer provided submissions dated 22 December 2023 in support of the review
application.
insurer submitted Merit Reviewer Medland found the claimant would recommence
work for Emerald Grain at the end of 2019 without
having regard to the
significant change in the claimant’s circumstances as follows:
(a) the claimant had not worked for Emerald Grain since working one week in
February 2018, and
(b) the claimant worked on a casual basis with ACAR in November 2018 and March
2019, meaning the claimant had not worked with Emerald
Grant since he worked as
a casual with ACAR.
insurer submits this change of circumstance means that Schedule 1 cl 4 (2A) will
apply where there has been a “significant
change in the claimant’s
earning circumstances that resulted in the earner regularly earning, or becoming
entitled to earn,
more on a weekly basis than he or she was earning before the
change occurred”. In these circumstances the insurer submits under
(2A) the pre-accident period “is the period of two years immediately
preceding the motor accident”.
not engaging with this change of circumstance the insurer submits Merit Reviewer
Medland failed to engage with the evidence or
provide her path of reasons for
rejecting that evidence.
relation to the calculation of PAWE the insurer submits the approach of Merit
Reviewer Medland fails to have regard to the objects
of the MAI Act and provides
a windfall to the claimant noting he was a seasonal worker who did not earn an
annual income but a seasonal
insurer relies upon the decision of
Shahmiri v Allianz
[2021] NSWPICMRP 2
to submit that the manner in which the weekly average was calculated was
a material error. The insurer notes if the claimant’s
PAWE is assessed at
$1,977 his yearly income would be $102,894, well in excess of the
claimant’s income generally.
submissions
claimant provided submissions dated 29 January 2024. The claimant submitted the
evidence that he had entered into an agreement
with Emerald Grain prior to the
accident is overwhelming.
claimant submitted once his earnings are to be determined under Schedule 4 cl
(2)(c) the words “earnings under the agreement”
demonstrates that
the earnings are not required to be averaged over 52 weeks.
REVIEW PANEL FINDINGS
Was the claimant an earner.
Was the claimant an earner under Schedule 1 cl 2(a)(ii)
insurer argued Mr Spence was an “earner” under cl 2(a)(ii) of
Schedule 1 on the basis he had been employed during
a period or periods equal to
at least 13 weeks during the year immediately preceding the accident and at the
date of the accident
had not retired permanently from all employment.
insurer conceded the evidence only established that the claimant worked 11 weeks
with ACAR during the year preceding the accident.
The claimant has not provided
payslips for the two periods 10 December 2018 and 16 December 2018 inclusive and
between 28 January
2019 and 3 February 2019 inclusive. The claimant’s
evidence is otherwise silent as to whether he worked those two weeks. However,
where the claimant has apparently been diligent in retaining his payslips, the
Panel is satisfied that the claimant, in fact, only
worked 11 weeks during the
year preceding the accident.
Accordingly,
the Panel finds the claimant was not an “earner” under cl 2(a)(ii)
of Schedule 1 arising out of his employment
the claimant is at least 15 years of age but was not employed,
(a) at any time during the eight weeks immediately preceding the accident;
(b) during a period of periods equal to at least 13 weeks during the year
immediately preceding the accident where the evidence only
demonstrates
employment for 11 weeks with ACAR;
(c) during a period or periods equal to at least 26 weeks during the two years
immediately preceding the accident where the evidence
demonstrates employment of
only 13.5 weeks, and
had not retired permanently from employment the Panel finds the claimant was
not an earner under cl 2(a) of Schedule 1 of the MAI
Was the claimant an earner under Schedule 1 cl 2(b)(i)
next question is whether the claimant, before the accident, had entered into an
arrangement with an employer or other person to
undertake employment at a
particular time and place qualifying him as an “earner” under cl
2(b)(i) of Schedule 1 of the
insurer submits there is no evidence to demonstrate that Sandy Newman had the
authority to offer a casual contract of employment,
that the conversation
detailed in the email from Sandy Newman of 9 August 2022 did no more than invite
the claimant to apply and,
the 2019 harvest season only lasted eight eight
Spence states he worked with Emerald Grain from 8 October 2016 to 17 December
2016 as a casual harvest worker, he formed a good
working relationship with his
supervisor Sandy Newman and he formed an expectation of working with Emerald
Grain in the future.
Panel accepts there was a good working relationship between Mr Spence and
Ms Newman having regard to the following:
(a) the conversation between Ms Newman and Mr Spence in April 2017 when
Mr Spence was advised he was still welcome to work the harvest
failed to secure a full-time position in mid-2017;
(b) the contact between Ms Newman and Mr Spence when he was informed, he had
secured harvest work shortly before the harvest commenced
in October 2017;
(c) where Mr Spence worked the harvest for Emerald Grain from 21 October 2017 to
15 December 2017;
(d) where Mr Spence worked for Emerald Grain for one week in February 2018;
(e) the conversation between Ms Newman and Mr Spence in or about November 2017
in relation to undertaking training so he could operate
a front-end loader
telehandler and skid steer;
(f) the conversation between Ms Newman and Mr Spence in April or May 2018 when
Mr Spence enquired about the availability of work
at harvest time;
(g) the written advice Mr Spence received from Emerald Grain in September 2018
to say there would be no work available for the 2018
harvest due to drought;
(h) the conversation between Ms Newman and Mr Spence in May 2019 when
Mr Spence enquired about the availability of work at harvest
Ms Newman advised she would contact him when it starts, verified by the
email from Ms Newman addressed to whom it may concern
dated 9 August 2022;
(i) the text message Mr Spence received from Ms Newman on 14 August 2019 in
which she said she was looking forward to having him
(j) the text message Mr Spence received from Ms Newman on 15 October 2019 asking
if he could attend the induction that day, and
(k) the letter to Mr Spence dated 18 September 2019 attaching a contract of
employment as a casual harvest employee for the period
21 October 2019 to
28 February 2020 or earlier.
Panel notes the pattern of employment with Emerald Grain demonstrated by the
claimant as follows:
where he worked
with Emerald Grain at harvest time between 8 October 2016 to 17 December 2016;
where he worked
with Emerald Grain at harvest time between 21 October 2017 to 15 December
where he worked
with Emerald Grain for one week in February 2018;
where he had
expectations of employment with Harvest Grain for the 2018 harvest which did not
occur due to the drought; and
where it is
clear from the interactions between Mr Spence and Ms Newman in 2019 that casual
work would have been made available to
him for the 2019 harvest, had he not
sustained injury in the accident.
Panel is satisfied Ms Newman had the authority to extend an offer of casual
employment to Mr Spence in 2019 where his earlier
contracts of employment had
been secured through Ms Newman and where it is apparent from her letter dated 18
September 2019 that
she had become the site manager with reporting
responsibility for the claimant as a casual employee.
Panel finds, uninjured, Mr Spence would have taken up the offer of casual
employment with Emerald Grain, in accordance with his
usual pattern of
employment. Whilst it is not necessary to establish that he had entered into a
written enforceable contract before
the accident, the Panel finds, in all
likelihood, Mr Spence would have signed the contract of employment offered to
him by Ms Newman
on 18 September 2019.
Panel finds having regard to the email from Ms Newman that Mr Spence would have
worked the harvest for Emerald Grain between 21
October 2019 and 20 December
2019, working on average 6 days a week, 10 hours a day.
Panel finds the claimant was an earner under Schedule 1 cl 2(b)(i) of the MAI
Act where before the accident he had entered into
an arrangement to undertake
employment with Emerald Grain commencing on 21 October 2019.

insurer submits the claimant’s employment with ACAR constituted a change
of circumstances that resulted in the claimant
regularly earning, or becoming
entitled to earn, more on a weekly basis than he was earning before the change
occurred in accordance
with Schedule 1 cl 4(3) of the MAI Act.
the Panel acknowledges that the claimant had not worked with Emerald Grain since
February 2018 and in the interim had worked
as a leading hand with ACAR between
December 2018 and March 2019 the Panel finds the employment with ACAR is
consistent with the
claimant’s pattern of undertaking short term casual
employment when and where available.
Panel notes the claimant’s earnings with ACAR were variable and does not
accept the insurer’s submission that the
claimant’s earnings with
ACAR represent a “significant change in the claimant’s earning

Thomas v Insurance Australia Limited t/as NRMA
Reviewer Williams concluded that the term “earnings circumstances”
as used in cl 4(3) of Schedule 1 refers to circumstances
involving an earner who
is earning at the time the change in circumstances
He stated at
“The note to Sch1 cl4(3) states that ‘[e]xamples
of a change of circumstances to which th[e] subclause would apply include
change of job, a promotion, a move from part-time to full-time employment, or a
pay increase arising from the achievement of performance
standards.’ The
examples in the note are non-exhaustive; there may be other changes of
circumstances to which the subclause
would apply. However, what the examples
have in common is that they all involve circumstances in which an earner has
been earning.
None of the examples involve circumstances where an earner goes
from earning nothing to earning something. Accordingly, I consider
that the term
‘earnings circumstances’, as used in Sch1 cl4(3), refers to
circumstances involving an earner who is earning
at the time the change in
circumstances occurs. If the earner is not earning, there are no ‘earnings
circumstances’,
and the subclause does not apply. Put another way, for
there to be ‘earnings circumstances’ there must be

evidence provided by Ms Newman is that work during the 2019 harvest would have

(8.57 weeks) for an average six

claimant submitted that a rate of $28.25 should be applied for the first 40
hours of work in a week and thereafter at time and
a half at the rate of $42.37.
However, payslips provided by the claimant demonstrate $28.25 is the normal rate
of pay and overtime
was paid at the rate of $38.42 per hour. The Panel is
satisfied this is the best available evidence and proposes to calculate the
gross weekly earnings as follows:
40 hours (normal
time) x $28.25 per hour $1,130
(overtime) x $38.42 per hour $768.40
Total $1,898.40.
relation to the calculation of the PAWE the insurer argues that having regard to
the objects of the MAI Act the likely weekly earnings
should be averaged over 52
Project Blue Sky v ABA
Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, and Hayne JJ
stated at [69]:
“The primary object of statutory construction
is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language
and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. The meaning of the provision
must be determined ‘by reference to the language
of the instrument viewed
as a whole’. In
Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos
Dixon CJ pointed out that ‘the context, the general purpose and policy of
a provision and its consistency and fairness are
surer guides to its meaning
than the logic with which it is constructed’. Thus, the process of
construction must always begin
by examining the context of the provision that is
being construed.”
examining the context of the provision, the Panel notes that Schedule 1 cl 4(1)
specifically refers to PAWE as the “weekly
average of the gross earnings
received by the earner as an earner during the 12 months immediately before the
day on which the accident
occurred, unless sub-cl (2) applies”. In other
words, the definition of PAWE defined by sub-cls (2)(a), 2(a1), 2(b) and 2(c)
are not governed by the limitations contained in cl 4 (1).
Allianz Insurance Australia Limited v Shamiri
Harrison AsJ considered the
construction of Sch 1 cl 4(1) of the MAI
The claimant had been employed
for 29 weeks in the 12 months prior to the accident and the question was
whether the earnings should
be averaged over 29 weeks or 52 weeks. Harrison AsJ
concluded the words “earnings as an earner” are intended to exclude
earnings earned by the earner that do not fall within the ambit of cl 2(a)
because they are not earnings from employment and not
to define the period over
which the earner’s gross earnings are to be averaged. In Shamiri Harrison
AsJ found the PAWE should
have been calculated by taking the earnings over the
whole of the
12-month period immediately before the date of the accident and
dividing it by 52 to reflect the number of weeks during that 12-month
relation to the sub-cls (2)(a) -(c) of sch1 cl 4 of the MAI Act, Harrison AsJ
“For completeness’ sake, regard should also be

insurer submits if the annual gross earnings are not averaged over 52 weeks it
would result in a windfall for the claimant resulting
in annual gross earnings
approaching $100,000, well in excess of the claimant’s usual earnings
given his pattern of intermittent
casual employment. Certainly, that would be
the outcome for Mr Spence. However, the Panel notes the reverse is also
possible. If
the claimant had entered into an arrangement with an employer to
undertake employment that was not seasonal and was expected to be

decision of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in
Transport Accident Commission
[2003] VCA 1730 relates to a casual fruit
picker who was in the midst of a
10-week fruit picking season at the time of
the accident. The Tribunal was considering
Accident Act, 1986
(VIC) which provides:
“For the purposes
of sub-section (1), if the period for which the earner has been employed by the
same employer is less than
four weeks, the earner's average weekly earnings may
be calculated having regard to the weekly earnings which the earner could
have been expected to have earned in that employment but for the
injury at the earner's ordinary time rate of pay for the earner's
normal number
of hours per week.”
President Coghlan stated at [26]:
“This case raises difficult
issues concerning the calculation of the amount payable for loss of earnings and
the period during
which they are payable. It is difficult, because the
legislation does not make specific provision for someone in Mr Monga's position,
a person who has had a series of part-time jobs with different employers in the
12 months preceding the accident. Whilst the Commission,
in calculating the
amount of ‘pre-accident weekly earnings’ as we can see, has taken
account of what he had earned in
the series of part-time jobs and what he was
going to earn as a fruit-picker, it is clear that whilst the general approach
reasonable, although the reason 52 weeks was chosen as the divisor
is somewhat obscure, that approach is not authorised by the
legislation.”
“In his case, the rate he earned as a fruit-picker
was higher than what he had earned in the other jobs he had had. He averaged
$510.67 with Setleaf and $439.66 with Benson Group. The Commission was concerned
that ongoing payment of benefits at the rate of
$594 would be a windfall. One
can imagine the opposite situation just as easily. A person injured might be
gravely disadvantaged,
where their pre-accident weekly earnings in a position
just commenced before the accident had been very small, and where they only
anticipated being in that employment for a short period. Are they to be left
with that low rate just as unfairly? Considerations
of that nature cannot affect
how one must interpret the sections as was highlighted by Hedigen J in TAC
v McRitchie
[2001] VSC 151
(2001) 17 VAR 347
referred to by Mr Brett in
his submissions.”
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal concluded
was a section
related to calculation, that is, to determine the amount of pre-accident weekly
earnings and that the reference in
to what he could have been earning

entitlement.
the provisions under interpretation are not identical and the decision of the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal is
not binding, the Panel finds the
decision in
to be informative.
1.3(4) of the MAI Act provides:
“In the interpretation of a
provision of this Act or the regulations, a construction that would promote the
objects of this

would not promote those objects.”
objects of the MAI Act are set out in s 1.3(2) of the MAI Act and include:
(a) to encourage early and appropriate treatment and care to achieve optimum
recovery of persons from injuries sustained in motor
accidents and to maximise
their return to work or other activities, and
(b) to provide early and ongoing financial support for persons injured in motor
the approach proposed by this Panel promotes the objects of the MAI Act, in
providing financial support for persons injured
in motor accidents.

McHugh J stated that, though
legislation should be construed to promote the objects of the Act, in applying a
purposive construction,
“the function of the Court remains one of
construction and not
legislation”.
added at [109]:
“When the express words of a legislative
provision are reasonably capable of only one construction and neither the
the provision nor any other provision in the legislation throws doubt
on that construction, a court cannot ignore it and substitute
a different

“unaware of any authority in which a court

been “read up”. The introduction of the

text is clear. The Panel notes the wording of the clause “the average
weekly gross earnings that the earner could reasonably
have been expected to
earn, but for the injury, in employment under that arrangement” in
Schedule 1 cl 4(2)(c) does not include
the words “averaged over the
12-month period immediately before the day on which the accident occurred”
and any attempt
to read the provision as if it did would not be “a
permissible process of statutory construction”. Under Schedule 1 cl
(2)(c) the calculation of the PAWE only requires:
(a) the claimant to have entered into an arrangement with an employer or other
person to undertake employment, and
(b) a calculation of average weekly gross earnings that he could reasonably have
been expected to earn, but for the injury, in employment
under that arrangement.
Panel is satisfied that it was not the intention of the legislature to calculate
the PAWE by averaging the claimant’s gross
weekly income in the 12 months
immediately before the day of the accident over a 12-month period having regard
to the clear meaning
of the text of Schedule 1 cl 4(2)(c) of the MAI Act.
Panel finds Sch 1 cl 4(2)(c) applies where Mr Spence had entered into an
arrangement with Emerald Grain to undertake employment
and finds that he could
reasonably have expected to earn the sum of $1,898.40 under that arrangement.
PANEL CONCLUSION
Panel revokes the certificate of Merit Reviewer Medland.
Panel certifies the claimant’s PAWE to be $1,898.40.
