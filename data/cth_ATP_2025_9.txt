INTRODUCTION
review Panel, Joseph Fayyad, Kristen Jung and Karen Phin (sitting President),
declined to conduct proceedings on an application
by the Munro Family Super Fund
in relation to the affairs of Vmoto Limited. The application concerned (among
other things) alleged
transfers of Vmoto shares to entities selected by the
board and alleged deficiencies in the share buy-back conducted by Vmoto in
context of a proposed de-listing. The review Panel reached similar conclusions
to the initial Panel and considered that there
was no reasonable prospect that
it would declare the circumstances unacceptable.

Preliminary Final Report
APPLICATION
2 March 2025, the applicant requested the President’s consent to apply for
a review of the decision by the initial Panel
pursuant to section
applicant submitted that it had been denied the knowledge that would have led it
to make a timely application in relation to “
the unacceptable conduct
that occurred in conjunction with the late 2023 rights issue and follow on
placement when those shares weren’t
broadly distributed in compliance with
the panel's guidance notes 1 and 17
” given the lack of substantial
holding notice disclosure by two of Vmoto’s substantial shareholders,
whose shareholding
increased from 6.1% to 11.41% and from 1.72% to 9.37%
respectively following the 2023 Capital Raising.
applicant also submitted that the positive results announced in the Preliminary
Final Report contrasted with Vmoto’s previously
forecasted loss for the
year in the Vmoto FY24 Guidance and that the Vmoto board had failed to inform
the market of these price sensitive
outcomes before proceeding with the Buy-back
at well below fair value given the contents of the [Preliminary Final
applicant sought the same interim orders and final orders sought in the initial
application.
President’s consent and interim orders
accordance with Guidance Note 2: Reviewing Decisions, the President’s
approach to consenting to a review is guided by the
following considerations:
that it is a policy underpinning s657EA(2) that there should be a
prompt conclusion to Panel proceedings
whether there was any potential error in the sitting Panel’s
decision and
whether there is any other basis for granting consent, for example, if
there is new evidence, the importance of the dispute, whether
there would
be material prejudice to any party by consenting or by withholding consent, and
the merits of the sitting Panel’s
President invited Vmoto and ASIC to provide submissions on whether the
applicant’s submissions in its review application
warranted the provision
of its consent to the review.
submitted that the President should decline to grant consent under section
657EA(2) given (among other things) there were no
errors in the initial
Panel’s decision and that the applicant did not provide any relevant new
material that could lead to
the President concluding that consent ought to be
granted. With regard to the applicant’s submissions in support of its
application, Vmoto also submitted (among other things) that:
(a) the applicant did not provide any basis or supporting evidence for its
statement that the securities issued under the 2023 Capital
weren’t broadly distributed in compliance with the panel's
guidance notes 1 and 17
(b) the application was “
significantly out of time
related to the 2023 Capital Raising
the Applicant is seeking to delay or prevent the
holding of a meeting that they required to be called (and cause Vmoto to breach
obligations under
section 249D(5)
Corporations Act
) is absurd and
should not be encouraged by the Panel
(d) the Buy-back was announced on 16 December 2024, along with the Proposed
De-listing, and “
was undertaken in an efficient, competitive and
informed market
(e) Vmoto was required to lodge a preliminary final report on Appendix 4E under
the ASX Listing Rules no later than two months after
the end of the accounting
period and had done so on 28 February 2025 with the Preliminary Final Report.
President was not on first view satisfied that there was any potential error in
the initial Panel’s decision and considered
whether the applicant’s
review application brought new evidence to light that would justify him
consenting to the review application.
President was also not convinced that the information about the number of shares
held by the second and third largest shareholders
of Vmoto was new evidence
given the information was disclosed in the 2024 annual report.
the President considered, in light of submissions made by Vmoto shareholders in
the initial proceedings regarding their concerns
with the value proposition
under the Buy-back,
Preliminary Final Report contained relevant new evidence. While not on first
view convinced that the new evidence would
be material, the President considered
that this would be for a review Panel to decide and, on balance, decided to
grant consent to
the review of the
President also considered, on an urgent basis, the interim order sought by the
applicant to postpone the Section 249D Meeting,
scheduled to be held on
Thursday, 6 March 2025. The President decided not to make that interim order,
noting that if the review
Panel (once appointed) made a declaration of
unacceptable circumstances, it could make a final order requiring another
meeting should
it see fit to do so.
powers of a review Panel are set out in section 657EA. Our role is to conduct a
receipt of the review application, but prior to the determination of the matter,
the following events occurred:
(a) On 6 March 2025, Vmoto announced the results of the Section 249D Meeting.
None of the board spill resolutions was carried and
the percentage of votes cast
on the poll was as follows:
1 Removal of Mr Blair Edward Sergeant as a director
2 Removal of Mr Erchuan Zhou as a director
3 Removal of Mr Aaron Reade Kidd as a director
4 Removal of Mr Yin How Teo as a director
5 Appointment of Mr Phillip Ashley Campbell as a director
6 Appointment of Mr Andrew Logie-Smith as a director
(b) On 7 March 2025, the ASX issued an Aware Letter requesting that Vmoto
provide certain information with regards to the variance
between the FY24
Guidance and the Preliminary Final Report (
ASX Aware Letter
) and, on 11
March 2025, Vmoto issued a response to the ASX Aware Letter.

number of transactions that have involved significant oppression of minority
shareholders and the transfer of 22.6% of the company’s
shares to entities
selected by the board to receive those shares in unacceptable circumstances as
defined in The Panels Guidance
Notes 1 and 17.
particular, the applicant submitted:
(a) in relation to the 2023 Capital Raising, that the Vmoto board had
no intention of, and made no attempt to
” broadly place the
shortfall shares and “
further oppressed minority shareholders by
placing an additional 9.98% of the shares on issue in the same fashion to
invited parties
under the follow on placement
” in unacceptable
circumstances having regard to the company’s need for funds
(b) in relation to the Employee Share Issue, that the timing of the issue prior
to the Proposed De-listing “
served to continue the pattern of putting
shares in the hands of supporters so the directors could benefit from their
support for
their proposals
(c) in relation to the Consideration Share Issue, that the terms of the
underlying transaction were “
far from arms length

increased the number of shares in the hands of supporters of the
(d) in relation to the Small Holdings Sale Facility, that shares were
transferred to parties selected by the board in unacceptable
circumstances.
appears to us that the applicant makes the following claims:
(a) that the Vmoto board has engaged in oppressive conduct
(b) that there is some form of association between the directors of Vmoto and
certain shareholders who have received Vmoto shares
(c) that Vmoto did not attempt to mitigate the control effect of the 2023
Capital Raising.
Oppressive conduct
several occasions, the applicant referred in its submissions to the
oppression of minority shareholders
submitted that the applicant made a “
broad and unsupported allegation
of ‘minority oppression’ by the Vmoto board
outside the Panel’s jurisdiction and for which “
there are many
more suitable forums to ventilate any concerns the Applicant may
consider that whether there has been an oppression of minority shareholders is
not a matter for us. Rather, our focus is whether
unacceptable circumstances
exist. We reiterate the initial Panel’s view that it is open to the
applicant to consider bringing
a shareholder oppression suit in the courts if it
Association
applicant submitted that the list of the 20 largest registered holders of quoted
securities in Vmoto, disclosed in Vmoto’s
annual reports, showed that
three of Vmoto’s shareholders’ holdings increased by a number of
shares that was materially
the same as “
the number placed to those
selected parties
” in the financial year of the 2023 Capital Raising
and that, given the results of the Section 249D Meeting, this “
probative and supportive evidence that
a large number, if not all, the
people who received shares that were placed by the board in unacceptable
circumstances voted with
the board which delivered the board financial benefit
and supports a rational conclusion that they have formed an association with
applicant also submitted that it was unable to confirm who the company placed
those shares with, in the absence of disclosure
by the company and the
two parties who became substantial holders during that
” and requested that the Panel “
use its extensive
powers to determine who received the shares that were placed to parties selected
by the board
the applicant submitted that its application was “
not reliant on
establishing associations
”, we agree with the initial Panel that the
applicant was, at least in part, alleging there was some form of association or
relationships between the directors of Vmoto and other shareholders that were
unacceptable.
submitted that the application made “
vague and unsupported assertions
that the Vmoto Board has sought to issue shares to a group of supportive
shareholders through various
issues of shares dating back to October
” and that it “
cannot properly be said to contain a
credible allegation of the existence of an association
” in a context
where the applicant did not “
specifically identify a bloc of voting
power that is alleged to be the subject of an association
Panel’s starting point for an association matter is that it is for the
applicant to demonstrate a sufficient body of evidence
of association and to
convince the Panel as to that association, albeit with proper inferences being
While we acknowledge the
difficulties that an applicant faces in gathering evidence in an association
matter, we reiterate that
the Panel has limited investigatory powers and that,
before we conduct proceedings, “
an applicant must do more than make
allegations of association and rely on us to substantiate them. An applicant
must persuade us
by the evidence it adduces that we should conduct
proceedings

to the Employee Share Issue being “

since the relevant transactions

second guess Vmoto’s board decision to exercise its discretion to issue
shares in these instances.
consider that the applicant fell short of providing a sufficient body of
material to warrant us conducting further enquiries into
the relationships
between the Vmoto directors and any Vmoto shareholders.
applicant submitted that the Shortfall Offer and the Follow-on Placement did not
comply with Guidance Note 17 and that the Vmoto
had no intention
of, and made no attempt to, broadly place those shares
applicant also queried the need for funds in the 2023 Capital Raising.
submitted that the Entitlement Offer was undertaken in accordance with all
applicable laws and for a genuine need for funds.

manner to minimise potential harm and disruption to the company and
shareholders
do not consider that the applicant demonstrated a basis for the Panel’s
intervention here, having regard to the lack of probative
evidence supporting
the applicant’s allegations and the historical nature of these
allegations.
Buy-back and Proposed De-listing
applicant submitted that “
[t]he company’s announcement on the
16/12/2024 of its intention to delist and off market equal access scheme to buy
shares at a fraction of the depreciated value of the company’s
tangible assets, 15 days before the end of it’s [sic]
financial year when
shareholders were completely uninformed about the company’s recent
performance, was clearly not in all
shareholders best interests
applicant submitted that the timing of the Buy-back was unacceptable and that
[t]he 10% of shares on issue bought back from people not wishing to
remain shareholders in an unlisted environment is in fact 40%

the Proposed Delisting does not have any effect on the
control or potential control of Vmoto and does not result in the acquisition

balance, we decided not to take it any further given
(in no particular order):
(a) issues related to the quality of financial reporting are best dealt with by
the corporate regulator ASIC
(b) the ASX Aware Letter with regards to (among other things) Vmoto’s FY24
results exceeding earnings guidance and Vmoto’s
response on 11 March 2025
(in which it confirmed that the outperformance was not material having regard to
ASX’s guidance
provided its basis for this conclusion)
(c) the Vmoto 3Q24 Market Update, which included a more positive outlook, had
been released prior to the Buy-back and
(d) when announcing the Buy-back and Proposed De-listing, the Vmoto board had
stressed that the company’s share price implied
a valuation that was
materially below the company’s fundamental value.
turned our minds to the potential control effect of the Buy-back and Proposed
De-listing. In
Flinders Mines Limited 02 and
the Panel stated
The decision of a company’s board to seek to de-list
involves the exercise of business or commercial judgement, and may be subject
(among other things) requirements of the applicable listing rules, the
discretions and policy of the relevant listing authority,
duties and minority shareholders remedies. It is not the Panel’s role, in
the ordinary course, to opine on
such judgements or enforce requirements for
which other regulators or the courts have primary responsibility. However, the
of such requirements does not prevent the Panel exercising its
role. In our view, where de-listing has or is likely to have an effect on
control or the acquisition of a substantial interest
in a listed company, and
appears inconsistent with the purposes in section 602, it is appropriate for us
to consider whether it gives
rise to unacceptable circumstances.
we are not satisfied that the allegations made, and the materials provided, in
relation to the Buy-back and Proposed De-listing
warrant us making further
Substantial holder disclosure
applicant submitted that, on 24 February 2025, it had lodged a request with ASIC
to investigate the lack of substantial holding
notices from two Vmoto
shareholders.

despite it not being Vmoto’s obligation to do so,
it had notified applicable existing substantial shareholders of the potential

the Buy-back and Proposed
De-listing, where shareholders have no other way of knowing who ultimately holds
those shares. Despite
Vmoto’s submission, no substantial holder notice
was lodged by the relevant shareholders during these
proceedings.
Accordingly,
given our concerns, we decided to refer this matter to ASIC for investigation.

(a) the 2023 Capital Raising, the Consideration Share Issue and the Small
Holdings Sale Facility all occurred some time ago, in 2023

given the lack of
disclosure from the substantial shareholders (see paragraph
note that the Employee Share Issue was within time but represents approximately
2% of Vmoto’s issued capital and is therefore
unlikely to have a control

circumstances.
regard to our decision not to conduct proceedings, we do not consider it
necessary to reach a view on whether to formally extend
time under section 657C

Other matters
Notice of Section 249D Meeting
applicant submitted that the voting form provided by Vmoto in relation to the
Section 249D Meeting was “
very confusing
” and that the letter
from the board in the notice of meeting made false and misleading statements
including that the requisitioning
shareholders were attempting to obtain
effective control of the board and the company without paying any control
submitted that its directors provided a recommendation to shareholders as to how
to vote at the Section 249D Meeting in the
notice of meeting which was
consistent with the proper exercise of their directors’ duties and that
[n]othing in the EGM Notice or the Proxy Form can properly be
considered to be misleading or confusing
the circumstances, we did not find the statement of the board in the notice of
meeting to be unacceptable.
Shareholder submissions
number of Vmoto shareholders wrote to the Panel executive in support of the
submissions made by the applicant. These shareholders
consented to the parties
being provided with their submissions and the parties were given the opportunity
to make submissions in

interest in this matter and, on occasion, the Panel will
receive comments from
interested persons who are not parties. It has discretion to do so, or not to
receive them.
initial Panel decided to receive submissions from non-party shareholders and we
had the benefit of these in these proceedings.
We did not consider that further
submissions from Vmoto shareholders were likely to be able to assist us and
decided not to receive
them, or any submissions made by the parties in response
to these submissions.
Allegations of
breach of Procedural Rules
submitted that it had concerns about the applicant breaching its media
canvassing undertakings and rule 19 of the Procedural
Rules in light of a post
made on the stock discussion website HotCopper.
consider that Vmoto’s allegations were substantively unsupported. In any
event, it is not unreasonable for a requisitioning
shareholder to seek to gain
shareholder support ahead of the relevant meeting. We are satisfied, on the
evidence provided, that
the applicant did not breach the Procedural Rules.
the reasons above, we do not consider that there is any reasonable prospect that
we would make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances.
