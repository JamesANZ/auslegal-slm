SOLICITORS:
Hemming & Hart, for Applicant
Neumann & Turnour, for Respondent
[1] This is an application under section 67(2)(a) of the
Land and Resources
Tribunal Act 1999
(LRT Act) for leave to appeal. Under that provision,
leave to appeal to the President with the President’s leave is required
the appeal is from the Tribunal as constituted by a presiding member
(alternative), mining referee or Land Court non-presiding
[2] The decision sought to be appealed against is that of Deputy President Smith
of 24 August 2007. In that decision ([2007] QLRT
123), the deputy president had
before him an application in a proceeding for the removal of a caveat. He
declined to make the orders
sought and made certain orders concerning the
amendment of the caveat.
[3] At the commencement of the hearing today, I raised with the parties the
question of whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction under
section 67(2)(a). My
concern was that the Tribunal which heard the caveat removal application was not
one which was constituted
by a presiding member (alternative), mining referee or
Land Court non-presiding member. Submissions were made by each party concerning
that issue.
[4] Ms Moody of Counsel endeavoured to convince me that the provisions of
section 67(2)(a) applied because of section 70A of the
LRT Act which provides as
70A Tribunal constituted by presiding member
(alternative)
(1) For a relevant provision, the tribunal is constituted by a presiding member
(alternative) if—
tribunal is constituted by a presiding member other than the president; and
(b) in giving directions for constituting the tribunal, the president was
required, under schedule 1, to choose—
(i) either a presiding member or a mining referee; or
(ii) a presiding member, a mining referee or a Land Court non-presiding
(2) In this
relevant provision
(a) section 67(2); or
(b) section 69(1);
(c) section 70(1).”
Ms Moody submitted that in subsection (1)(b), I as President was required to
choose either a presiding member or a mining referee
(paragraph (i)) or in
paragraph (ii) a presiding member, a mining referee or a Land Court
non-presiding member for the caveat application.
It was said that the first of
the alternatives (either a presiding member or a mining referee) should be read
in a disjunctive way,
such that if I were required under schedule 1 of the LRT
Act to constitute the Tribunal by
a presiding member
mining referee, that would be sufficient for the purposes of section
and therefore the provisions of section 67(2)(a) would be
satisfied. It was also submitted that the provisions of section 70A(1)(b)(ii)
should be read in a disjunctive way as well. That would mean again that if I
were required under schedule 1 to appoint
a presiding member
a mining referee
a Land Court non-presiding member to hear
the caveat application, the provisions of section 70A would be satisfied,
thereby activating
section 67(2)(a).
[5] The difficulty with that submission, it seems to me, is that the words
“either a presiding member or a mining referee”
are used in a
compendious way. So for example, in schedule 1, if a proceeding is about a
caveat under
section 305
Mineral Resources Act 1989
Tribunal is to be constituted by a “presiding member or mining
referee”. To then further dissect that expression,
would be satisfied if
a presiding member
mining referee constituted the Tribunal, in my opinion, is erroneous. That can
be demonstrated by reference to both paragraphs
(i) and (ii) of section
70A(1)(b) because the words “presiding member” are referred to in
both paragraphs; similarly,
“mining referee” is repeated as well.
That would mean, if Ms Moody’s submission were correct, that the words
member” would be referred to twice, “mining
referee” twice and “Land Court non-presiding member” once
the two Tribunal-constitution paragraphs. What I think section 70A(1)(b)(i) and
(ii) means is that if I were required under schedule
1 to chose one of two
alternatives, then the provisions of section 70A would be satisfied. Those
alternatives are in the first place,
a presiding member or a mining
and there are numerous instances in schedule 1 where that
compendious expression is used; alternatively, a presiding member, a mining
referee or a Land Court non-presiding member. Mr Fisher of Counsel referred me
of the MRA which is referred to in
schedule 1 as requiring a
hearing about compensation for a mining claim to be heard by a presiding
a mining referee or a
Land Court non-presiding member. That is a good
illustration.
[6] There is another way of looking at this which also militates against Ms
Moody’s submission. There is a requirement in
the LRT Act (section 39)
for me as President to constitute the Tribunal for a proceeding. Section 39(1)
provides that for a proceeding
before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is to be
constituted under the direction of the President by a single member or a panel
as provided
under that part. There is no similar or complementary requirement
in the LRT Act for the Tribunal to be constituted under my direction,
application in a proceeding
. The emphasis in section 39 is
upon the term “proceeding”. That is consistent with the headings
used in schedule 1.
For example, under the heading
Mineral Resources Act 1989
there are 3 aspects which are listed there: the first is “Sections
conferring jurisdiction”, next “Nature of
proceeding” and then
“Constitution of tribunal”. Again it is nature of the
which is consistent with the words used in section 39.
[7] The point of this is that when Titan Sandstone’s application to start
proceedings was filed in the Tribunal on 30 July
2007 and given file number MRAA
118 of 2007, that was the “proceeding” and that proceeding sought
certain relief. It
sought to recover sandstone which had been extracted and the
delivery of certain items of plant and equipment; a claim was also made
restitution or for a declaration of a constructive or resulting trust and
damages for conversion. Once that originating application
was received, I
proceeded to constitute the Tribunal for that matter under section 363 of the
MRA pursuant to schedule 1 of the LRT
Act, as a presiding member. Once the
Tribunal had been constituted for that matter,
“proceeding”, in my opinion. Subsequently when Chongherr’s
application for a caveat was filed, it was
filed not as an originating
application but in the guise of an
application in a
namely, in MRAA 118 of 2007. As I have said, there
is no statutory requirement for me to then constitute the Tribunal for such an
interlocutory application. The reason for that, it seems to me is that such an
application in a proceeding would be heard by the
member of the Tribunal who was
hearing the principal application.
[8] In the circumstances of this case, I have formed the view that this
application for leave to appeal is incompetent. That does
not mean however that
a dissatisfied litigant, in this case Chongherr, has no remedy. It has the
remedy provided under section 67(2)(b)
of the LRT Act which applies when the
Tribunal is not constituted by a presiding member (alternative), mining referee
or Land Court
non-presiding member
namely to appeal to the Court of
Appeal. In those circumstances, the application by Chongherr for leave to
proceed will be dismissed.
[9] Costs were sought by Titan. In my opinion, the point of statutory
interpretation was clear but apparently had not been appreciated
by the lawyers
for each party until today. I have found that this application for leave is
incompetent and I regard that as constituting
circumstances” for the purposes of section 50 of the LRT Act. I will
therefore order the applicant Chongherr
to pay Titan’s costs of and
incidental to this application on the standard basis to be agreed between the
parties or as assessed
by the Registrar.
