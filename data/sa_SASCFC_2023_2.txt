[2023] SASCFC 2
Full Court: Livesey P, Bleby and David JJ
Introduction
Legal Profession Conduct Commissioner applies for orders that the
practitioner’s name be struck from the roll of legal
practitioners and
that the practitioner pay the Commissioner’s costs of the application.
Commissioner’s application is made pursuant to
Practitioners Act 1981
) which is in the following
Where the Supreme Court is satisfied, on the application of
the Commissioner, the Attorney-General or the Society, that a legal practitioner
is disqualified or suspended from practice under the law of any other State
(whether or not that State is a participating State),
it may, without further
inquiry, impose a corresponding disqualification or suspension under the
provisions of this section.
, or under this Court’s inherent jurisdiction as recognised
of the Act, this Court may order that the name of a legal practitioner
be struck off the roll of legal practitioners maintained under
the Act, or the
roll kept in a participating State that corresponds to the roll maintained under
the reasons that follow, orders should be made in the terms sought by the
Commissioner.
The order made in Victoria
letter dated 9 November 2021, the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Victoria
advised the Registrar of the Supreme Court of
South Australia that the
practitioner’s name had been struck off the Roll of Barristers and
Solicitors of the Supreme Court
of Victoria pursuant to the judgment of Dixon J
made on 11 October 2021.
reasons that are not explained on the material made available to this Court,
Registry did not provide a copy of the letter to
the Commissioner until an email
was sent on 9 March 2023.
20 June 2023, a representative of the Commissioner wrote to the practitioner
advising that the Commissioner had decided to institute
disciplinary proceedings
seeking an order for strike off pursuant to
of the Act. The
practitioner was invited to indicate whether he would consent to an order, as
well as to the application being dealt
with without a hearing. Personal service
has been proved. The Commissioner has not received a response from the
practitioner.
the callover on 25 August 2023, the Commissioner invited this Court to make an
order for striking off without further inquiry
and to deal with the application
without a hearing pursuant to r 261.2 of the
Uniform Civil Rules 2020
this Court regards striking off as a matter of public interest, where
transparency in the Court’s consideration and
determination of the matter
is important, this is a proper case for the Court to exercise its discretion to
proceed on the papers
in private.
is appropriate to proceed in private in this matter for the following reasons.
First, this Court is effectively being asked to
act on the order made by the
Supreme Court of Victoria. Whilst it might be said that the Court retains a
discretion in the matter,
the exercise of that discretion is in this case
straightforward.
it is not necessary for this Court to examine the personal circumstances of the
practitioner or to do other than proceed
on the basis of the careful and
detailed findings made by Dixon J. Finally, and relatedly, the practitioner has
been a party to a
lengthy proceeding in Victoria in which the circumstances of
his misconduct (addressed later in these reasons) have been outlined
considerable detail. Those proceedings, together with the reasons of Dixon J,
were widely publicised at the time.
The Victorian
proceedings
practitioner’s misconduct came to light in connection with proceedings
commenced as a class action by a group of investors
against Banksia Securities
Ltd, the trustee of a failed investment scheme. The practitioner was retained
as senior counsel for Bolitho,
one of the investors and lead plaintiff in that
class action until 2019.
proceedings were conducted in the Group Proceedings List before the Commercial
solicitor on the record for the plaintiffs was Mr Mark Elliott of Elliott Legal.
He had incorporated Australian Funding Partners
Australian Funding
) to act as litigation funder for the group of plaintiff investors.
Entities controlled by the family of Mr Elliott (AMEO Investments
and an entity controlled by the family of the practitioner (Noysue Pty Ltd) held
substantial shareholdings in Australian
Funding Partners. It followed that the
practitioner had a financial interest in the proceedings over and above any
legal fees recoverable
as senior counsel.
November 2017, the Victorian proceedings settled in favour of the plaintiffs in
an amount of $64 million. Australian Funding
Partners sought and obtained
approval for a funding commission of $12.8 million in addition to legal costs
and disbursements. These
were said to amount to $4.7 million, including fees
payable to the practitioner in the order of $2.5 million.
plaintiff investor appealed the settlement approval and the claims for
commission and legal costs, contending that they were neither
reasonable nor
proportionate. The Court of Appeal subsequently approved the settlement but
remitted the questions of commission
and costs to the Supreme
A Contradictor was
appointed, whereupon the practitioner and his junior, Mr Michael Symons,
returned their briefs.
an extensive investigation, the Contradictor submitted to the Supreme Court that
Australian Funding Partners should not be
permitted to recover any amount for
costs. It was submitted that there was disentitling conduct, including
dishonesty and misconduct
by the practitioner, junior counsel and the solicitors
on the record for the plaintiffs. The Contradictor submitted that compensation
should be paid to the debenture shareholders together with the costs of the
remittals on an indemnity basis by Australian Funding
Partners and, amongst
others, the practitioner.
the trial and the remittals, shortly before giving evidence, the practitioner
announced through his senior counsel that he
did not maintain any defence to the
allegations made by the Contradictor, that he consented to the entry of judgment
against him,
that he accepted that his name should be removed from the roll of
persons admitted to the legal profession and he abandoned all claims
this dramatic announcement, Dixon J reserved his decision and on 11 October 2021
delivered very extensive reasons supporting
orders that the claim by Australian
Funding Partners for commission and costs be dismissed. His Honour also ordered
that, with others,
the practitioner pay compensation in the sum of
$11.7 million together with the cost of the remittals and the Contradictor
indemnity basis. Dixon J ordered that the names of the practitioner and
his junior counsel be removed from the roll pursuant to
the court’s
inherent jurisdiction.
Dixon was satisfied that the conduct of the practitioner contravened his
obligations to act honestly, not to mislead or deceive
and to ensure that legal
costs were both reasonable and proportionate. His Honour found that the
practitioner’s conduct amounted
to a breach of his paramount duty to the
particular, Dixon J found that both the practitioner and his junior facilitated
the provision of costs agreements to the Contradictor
in a manner that suggested
that they were created before costs were incurred when that was false. They
were only created after the
event in December 2017. Moreover, Dixon J held that
the practitioner and his junior had continued to act after serious allegations
had been made against them when they knew those allegations to be true and that
they had resisted the Contradictor’s efforts
to establish when their costs
agreements were made. His Honour found that the practitioner attempted to
collude with witnesses so
as to mislead the court.
Dixon observed that the practitioner had not offered any explanation for his
conduct and that it was only after the Contradictor’s
opening submissions
had laid bare the true extent of the “appalling conduct” that the
practitioner and others “capitulated
and purported to express
Dixon found that the practitioner’s deception of the court and the
debenture holders was undertaken “in the arrogant
and defiant (but
ultimately erroneous) belief that their conduct would go
undetected”.
Dixon also found that the conduct “left a stain on the integrity of
barristers as a profession”. His Honour
“O’Bryan’s conduct, in particular, deserved strong
condemnation”.
analysing the material in painstaking detail, Dixon J held that the
practitioner’s claim for fees based on work that
he claimed to have
carried out was patently false,
that ultimately there was no proper basis for the claim for fees sought to be
Dixon explained that the “fraudulent scheme relied on projecting an image

on end, without generating

given of dishonest charging by each of the practitioner and his junior.
