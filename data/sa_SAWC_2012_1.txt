GEOLOGICAL SERVICES P/L v WHITE LAKES P/L
[2012] SAWC 1
Reasons for Ruling of Senior
Warden Dr Cannon (
27 March 2012
Waiver of exemption - jurisdiction.
OLLIVER GEOLOGICAL
SERVICES P/L v WHITE LAKES
[2012] SAWC 1
is an application for a Waiver of exemption to be granted for a new mineral
lease, ML 6348. It is a new lease. It is a new
waiver. There has been a
change of the legislation since this plaint came before the court and before I
look at the affect of that,
I summarise the history of this matter.
is all part of a long-term agreement between White Lakes Pty Ltd and Olliver
Geological Services Pty Ltd, which was the operator.
I now have a transfer
process going through the department between Olliver Geological Services Pty Ltd
to Mr Traeger’s company.
Mr Traeger is not a stranger to this mining
operation. I understand he was working with Olliver Geological Services Pty
agreement always had in mind a succession of mining leases. There are
a series of relatively small deposits on White Lakes Pty Ltd’s
was always the intention that as one was finished a new one would start-up and
it would be, as required, the subject of
a new lease.
have been two previous disputes between the parties over this and the most
recent dispute prior to the one before me now was
in No. DCCIV-05-62. The
respondents, Mr and Mrs Haeusler who own White Lakes Pty Ltd, were represented
by Mr Critchley. It was
clear from the transcript in that matter that, with the
benefit of legal advice, White Lakes Pty Ltd acknowledged that this was part
an ongoing operation. Indeed, I note at p.6 of the transcript of 20 October
2005 that when the matter was resolved Mr Olliver,
representing his own company,
specifically noted at line 19 and following:
MR OLLIVER: And there will be subsequent – we have another mineral
claim that’s yet to be mined and yet to be geologically
mapped and there
may be a third and there may be a fourth all on White Lakes’ property.
So we want that same thing to roll
through for the life of the mine because
one of them in particular will only last for one year.
WARDEN: I can’t see that this, from what Mr Critchley is saying, his
client wouldn’t have any – too much difficulty
providing that
their rights were embedded in the agreement to give them their rights, a
contractual right. Is that a correct understanding,
Mr Critchley?
MR CRITCHLEY: That’s my current instructions. It’s fair to say
the relationship has been a bit strained at present.
MR OLLIVER: It took us a long time to get to that agreement.
WARDEN: I see.
MR OLLIVER: Several years and it was hard work.
MR CRITCHLEY: It might be overly optimistic to say that we could get another
agreement in place in respect to the future.
WARDEN: Your client wants to reserve its position I understand.
That’s something that has to be met with on the merits of
each occasion.
I can’t be prescriptive.
the warden specifically put in place exemptions by agreement in respect of ML
6146 and 6147, which have now been mined. There
is an issue about
rehabilitation on at least one of those.
is clear from the agreement that the parties had in mind a continuous operation
and a series of waivers that White Lakes Pty Ltd
bound itself to grant. It is
clear that the
(the Act), itself, protects future
Section 9AA(12)
of the amended Act, and the earlier Act too,
specifically protects successors in title to both the freehold interest and the
interest. The fact that there is a change from Olliver Geological
Services Pty Ltd to Mr Traeger’s company does not break
the legal rights
that Mr Traeger has succeeded to under the original agreement. I was proceeding
on that basis and then they amended
the Act. That came into effect in July 2011
and removed, from this court, the jurisdiction dealing with issues of Waivers of
Of course, this application pre-dated the change to the Act. The
law is that where a change to an Act has a procedural effect,
rather than
effecting substantive rights, then it affects everything, even things that were
in place before the Act. If I am dealing
with a Waiver of Exemption application
that was in place before the Act changed, after the Act changes and removes my
I have no further power to deal with it. The cases are clear on
that. I note
Maxwell v Murphy
[1957] HCA 7
(1957) 96 CLR 261
York Civil P/L v Workers Compensation Trib & Anor
[1999] SASC 173.
is clear to me that, although I may have jurisdiction (and I think I clearly do)
in relation to the agreement between the parties
here and this proposed
operation is covered by that agreement, to the extent that enforcing the
agreement will involve me imposing
a Waiver over the objection of White Lakes
Pty Ltd, then, I do not have jurisdiction to make that order in relation to the
further note that there is an issue here of an alleged deficiency in
rehabilitation. The agreement between the parties does not
grant the Waiver, or
the right to mine, subject to successful rehabilitation but this court has
always been concerned to ensure that
landowners, who are subject to mining, are
left afterwards with their land in as productive a state as it was before, or if
not, that they are compensated on a continuing basis for the loss of
productivity. In that respect, I refer to my decision in
Southern Titanium
NL v Heidrich & Ors
[2004] SAWC 1.
short answer is, I do not have jurisdiction to force a Waiver on Mr and Mrs
Haeusler’s company Whitelakes Pty Ltd over their
objection. It would be
unproductive for me to rule on the agreement. This must be determined in the
Environment, Resources and
Development (ERD) Court. Rather than require the
parties to start again in the ERD Court, what I intend to do is refer this
to the ERD court and ask the Registrar of that court to fix an early
mention date to decide on the best way to bring this matter
to a prompt
conclusion.
MR TRAEGER: Just a matter on that rehabilitation. It has already been
approved by the Mines Department that it is finished. The
lease has been
surrendered and the bank guarantee, the bond, has already been returned to us.
Has rehabilitation really, got anything
to do with us anymore now or is it back
in the hands of the Mines Department?
HIS HONOUR: The way I read the agreement between you, rehabilitation is left
to the Mines Department. Whether it is sufficient,
or not, is something that
has to be argued within that process of granting the leases, the mining and
rehabilitation program (the
MARP) and the cancellation of the leases. You tell
me there are no problems with the rehabilitation there. Mr Haeusler has a
view of that. I have mentioned the issue for completeness so that,
as I hand the file over to the ERD court, they are well aware
of the issue.
Whether that court decides that it is nothing to do with the court anymore
and it is only a matter for – what was the Department
Industries and Resources (PIRSA) – and is now the Department for
Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and
Energy (DMITRE), that is a
matter you will have to raise with the ERD Court. I have only mentioned it
because it is an important
issue to Mr Haeusler and so I have put it on the
record. I am not, in putting it on the record, suggesting that your
rehabilitation
was deficient. I am just identifying the issue. I am sorry I
cannot help you anymore but Parliament has bound me not to.
