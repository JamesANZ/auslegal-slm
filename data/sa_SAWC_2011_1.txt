Precious Stones Claim amalgamation. Meaning of 'contiguous'.
TRENHAM & ANOR v
DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES
[2011] SAWC 1
this matter, I refer to the Oxford Dictionary definition of contiguous which
Sharing a common border; touching.
Department has long enforced the Regulation dealing with the amalgamation of the
labour conditions of Precious Stones Claims on
the basis that they must share a
common boundary and not just be touching at a point. The basis for this is
partly that equipment
can be moved on the surface without leaving the claims.
More importantly, is the possibility of underground mining moving from one
to the other and, of course, that can only occur if they have a common boundary
otherwise underground mining, moving from one
to the other, would involve
illegal mining across the gap. If I interpreted contiguous to be in the close
vicinity, as the Macquarie
Dictionary might allow, or just touching, then this
would cause enforcement problems and I am not inclined to do that. I have long
interpreted this Regulation to mean having some common boundary beyond touching
and I intend to continue with that interpretation.
claimholders here have been advised of that attitude by the Department and I
understand they do not seek to contest that view
of the Regulations and,
accordingly, they will continue to work the claims sufficiently each without an
amalgamation.
application is dismissed.
