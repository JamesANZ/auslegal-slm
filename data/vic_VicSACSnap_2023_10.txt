Sentencing Snapshot 282: Sentencing Trends for Sexual Penetration of a
Child Aged 12 to under 16 in the Higher Courts of Victoria
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of sexual
penetration of a child aged 12 to under
in the County and Supreme Courts
of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2017-18 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to under 16 and other
offences is available on
A person who takes part in an act of sexual penetration of a child aged
between 12 and under 16 is guilty of an indictable offence
that carries a
maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 1,800 penalty
Sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to under 16 is a standard sentence
offence if it was committed on or after 1 February 2018.
This means that courts
must take into account that a prison sentence of 6 years represents the middle
of the range of objective seriousness
This Snapshot focuses on cases where sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to
under 16 was the principal offence, that is, cases where
sexual penetration of a
child aged 12 to under 16 was the offence that received the most severe
Sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to under 16 was the principal offence
in 3.2% of cases sentenced in the higher courts between
2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 275 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of sexual penetration of a child aged
12 to under 16.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to under 16 by financial
year. There were
49 people sentenced for this offence in 2021-22, up from 41 in the previous
year. The number of people sentenced
was highest in 2017-18 (69 people) and
lowest in 2020-21 (41 people). There were 72 people whose offending attracted

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the offence of sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to under

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for sexual penetration
of a child aged 12 to under 16 face multiple charges, which are finalised at the
same hearing. This section looks at the range of offences that offenders were
sentenced for alongside the principal offence of sexual
penetration of a child
aged 12 to under 16.
Figure 9 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to under 16 by the

ranged from 1 to 29, and the median was
3 offences. There were 68 people (24.7%)
sentenced for the single offence of sexual penetration of a child aged 12 to
under 16. The
average number of offences per person was 4.3.

The offence of sexual
penetration of a child aged 12 to under 16 has changed over time. Prior to 17
March 2010, this offence was
known as 'sexual penetration of a child aged
between 10 and 16' (
Crimes Act 1958
s 45(2)(c))
and had a maximum
penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. On 17 March 2010, the offence was renamed
'sexual penetration of a child aged
between 12 and 16'. On 1 July 2017, this
offence was transferred to
section 49B
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic), with
a new maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment. Additionally, the separate
offence of 'sexual penetration of a child
aged between 12 and 16 under care,
supervision or authority' was repealed on the same date, with any new charges of
this offence
to be prosecuted under
section 49B
(with the 'care, supervision or
authority' of the offender acting as a possible aggravating factor for
sentencing purposes). To maintain
meaningful comparison over the reference
period, this Snapshot includes the offence of sexual penetration of a child aged
10 and 16, sexual penetration of a child aged between 12 and 16, and
sexual penetration of a child aged between 12 and 16 under care,
supervision or

from 2017-18 to 2021-22.

from the Strategic Analysis and Review Team at

appeal outcomes was collected by the Sentencing Advisory Council from the
Australasian Legal Information Institute
was also provided by the Victorian Court of Appeal. The Sentencing Advisory
Council regularly undertakes extensive quality control
measures for current and
historical data. While every effort is made to ensure that the data analysed in
this Snapshot is accurate,
the data is subject to revision. The data does not
always specify whether the child was aged under 12 or aged 12 to under 16. In
order to determine the specific offence in those cases, the Council reviews
sentencing remarks. At the time of publication, sentencing
remarks for 12 of 362
cases (3.3% of cases) were unavailable or provided insufficient detail to
identify the age of the victim. These
cases have been excluded from both this
