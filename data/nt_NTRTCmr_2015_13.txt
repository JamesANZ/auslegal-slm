REASONS FOR THE ORDER OF THE COMMISSIONER OF TENANCIES
INQUIRY - Wednesday, 25 March 2015
KATE WATTS AND JAMES DUFF (‘Tenants’)
MARGARET O'NEILL (‘Landlord’)
RT1415-0490
is a determination of an application by the Tenants dated 22 January 2015 in
respect of premises being 4/56 Bayview Boulevard,
Bayview in the Northern
Territory of Australia (‘the premises’), seeking an order of
compensation in the sum of $1,560
(2 weeks rent) under section 122 of the
Residential Tenancies Act
(NT) (‘the Act’) due to the
Landlord’s failure to repair an air conditioner in the main living area of
the premises
for a period of 4 months.
Notice of Inquiry dated 16 February 2015 was posted to the parties. The Inquiry
was conducted on Wednesday, 25 March 2015. The
following appeared at the
Inquiry and made submissions:
(a) Kate Watts
for the Tenants (by telephone); and
(b) Charlene
O’Sullivan and Rebecca Nibbs of Colliers International on behalf of the
evidence before the Inquiry consisted of the following materials:
the documents
submitted by the Tenant in support of the application and kept under tab
‘Tenants Materials’ on the Commissioner
of Tenancies file numbered
RT1415-0490;
submitted by the Landlord responding to the application and kept under tab
‘Landlord Materials’ on the Commissioner
of Tenancies file numbered
RT1415-0490;
evidence of Ms Watts and Ms O’Sullivan.
find there is a tenancy agreement between the landlord and the tenant in respect
of the premises within the meaning of and subject
to the provisions of the Act.
The key details of the tenancy agreement are as follows:
Duration: Fixed
term commencing 14 March 2014 and ending 12 March 2015;
Rent: $780 per
fortnight payable in advance;
Deposit: $3,120.
the commencement of the Inquiry I noted that Ms Watts was the only applicant
listed on the RT01Application to the Commissioner
for Tenancies, however the
Tenancy Agreement provided that she had a co-tenant, Mr James Duff. I advised Ms
Watts that should I find
in her favour I would only be able to make an order
awarding half of the full amount of compensation, being her entitlement but not
her co-tenant’s. This would still leave a compensation application open to
Watts submitted that she was acting for Mr Duff but did not realise that she
should have obtained a letter of authority from Mr
Duff. Furthermore the RT01
application only listed her as the applicant with no mention of Mr Duff.
parties commendably took a constructive approach to this issue so that the
matter could be resolved quickly and to achieve a degree
of finality.
Landlord consented to the RT01 application being amended to permit Mr Duff to be
a party to the application and for Ms Watts to
act on behalf of Mr Duff.
Watts was asked to provide a letter of authority from Mr Duff and advised that a
copy would be provided to the Landlord. Ms Watts
was able to e-mail a scanned
copy of a letter of authority from Mr Duff shortly after the hearing. A copy was
provided to the Landlord.
The Repairs to the Air
conditioner
ingoing condition report in relation to the premises (accepted by the Tenants)
dated 14 March 2014 reported the condition of the
air conditioner in the main
living area of the premises as follows:
Samsung, clean, secure and in working order.”
main living room area air conditioner became faulty from 26 July 2014. The
Tenant provided notice of the defect in writing (via
e-mail) to the
Landlord’s agents on 27 July 2014.
note that this satisfies the requirement set out in section 122(2) of the Act
that a party may not apply for compensation for loss
or damage suffered by
reason of a breach of the landlord’s duty to repair, unless notice under
section 58(1) has been given.
materials provided by the Landlord’s agent clearly demonstrated genuine
efforts on behalf of the Landlord to repair the
air conditioner. The
Landlord’s agent provided copies of work orders issued to repairers to
repair the air conditioner dated
28 July 2014, 8 August 2014, 13 October 2014,
10 November 2014 and 25 November 2014.
materials submitted by the Landlord also illustrated the difficulties the
Landlord experienced in arranging repairs to the air
conditioner under warranty
or by the developer of the premises. The premises are relatively new and the air
conditioner was apparently
still under warranty. This added to the delay in
having the air conditioner repaired.
parties agreed that the air conditioner was not in working order from 27 July
2015 (being the date the defect was reported) to
6 October 2014, approximately a
9 week period.
parties agreed that the air conditioner was repaired on 6 October 2014. Some
later electrical works were carried out in November
and December 2014 to
properly earth the air conditioner, however the Tenants confirmed that from 6
October 2014 the air conditioner
was usable and in working order.
122 of the Act makes it clear that a tenant may apply for compensation for loss
of damage because the Landlord has failed
to comply with the agreement or an
obligation under the Act relating to the tenancy agreement.
Landlord’s duty to maintain the premises is made a term of the tenancy
agreement under section 57(1)(b) of the Act.
questions that require consideration are whether the Landlord has breached their
duty under section 57(1)(b) of the Act and the
tenancy agreement? and if so, has
the Landlord acted with ‘reasonable diligence’ to have the defect
repaired? Section
57(2) of the Act provides that a landlord is not in breach of
their duty to maintain premises in a reasonable state of repair unless
to with reasonable diligence to have the defect repaired.
are a number of cases that have found that that delay caused by tradespersons or
suppliers is no defence to a failure by the
Landlord to carry out required
the matter of
Dupont and Rowe v
example, the New South Wales Residential Tribunal stated,
would not avail the landlord anything to argue that financial problems with the
builder or other such problems, precluded
the repairs being done. The term
reasonable does not go to these issues, and deals only with the actual state of
evidence clearly indicates that the Landlord failed to maintain the air
conditioner in a reasonable state of repair. The Landlord
conceded this point at
the hearing. The air conditioner was not usable for 3 months. The fact that
there were some delays in getting
the air conditioner repaired due to
discussions between the Landlord, developer of the premises and warranty agent
regarding whose
responsibility it was to repair the air conditioner, is not a
relevant factor that that releases the Landlord from this duty.
also does not form the basis of a persuasive argument that the Landlord could
not have acted with reasonable diligence. The evidence
indicates that the
Landlord at least initially acted with reasonable diligence. However, when it
appeared that the issues regarding
liability or responsibility to repair the air
conditioner were not going to be resolved quickly with the developer of the
and/or warranty agent, the Landlord should have made her own decisive
arrangements to get the air conditioner repaired. The discussions
developer and/or warranty agent could have then been dealt with as a separate
find that the Landlord has failed to act with reasonable diligence to have the
air conditioner repaired. The Landlord is therefore
in breach of the term of the
tenancy agreement (due to the effect of section 57(1)(b)) to maintain the
premises and ancillary property
in a reasonable state of
The Amount of Compensation
Tenants advised that the 2 weeks compensation amount they applied for was not
calculated using a formula (eg. a deduction of a
specific amount of rent per
week for the period that the air conditioner was not usable). The figure was
determined on the basis
of what they thought was reasonable.
Tenants agree that it would not be reasonable to expect the air conditioner to
have been repaired instantaneously after they reported
the defect on 27 July
2013. However, they considered that it would be reasonable to expect the air
conditioner to have been fixed
within a 2 to 3 week period.
agent for the Landlord advised that in her experience as property manager, a 4
to 6 week period would be more realistic.
amount of compensation however is to be determined from the date of the breach

suffered ‘loss’ or
‘damage’, not when the Landlord ought to have effected repairs if
