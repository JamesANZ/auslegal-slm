Offences for
William Downs (
) is before the court having pleaded guilty to
five offences of contravening a family violence order (
), contrary to
Family Violence Act 2016
dates on which the offences occurred are as follows:
(a) CAN 11884/2023 (
First Offence
): 24 November 2023;
(b) CAN 12393/2023 (
Second Offence
): 4 December 2023;
(c) CAN 12394/2023 (
Third Offence
): 4 December 2023;
(d) CAN 1566/2024 (
Fourth Offence
): 15 December 2023 and 31 January 2024;
(e) CAN 3828/2025 (
Fifth Offence
): 23 March 2024.
maximum penalty for each offence is a fine of $80,000, a term of imprisonment
for five years, or both.
addition to those five charges, the offender has requested that two further
charges be taken into account (collectively, the
(a) CAN 6028/2024 use unregistered / suspended vehicle; and
(b) CAN 6029/2024 use uninsured vehicle on road or road related area.
Scheduled offences attach to the Fifth Offence of contravening a family violence
order as the principal offence.
conviction for the offences, the offender will also be in breach of two
suspended sentences that were imposed in the Magistrates
Court on 22 September
(a) CAN 968/2023 aggravated common assault (family violence) contrary to
Crimes Act 1900
(b) CAN 970/2023 aggravated common assault (family violence) contrary to
each sentence that was suspended, the offender had signed an undertaking to
comply with good behaviour obligations for a period
of two years (from 22
September 2023 until 21 September 2025).
FVO that was breached was issued in the Magistrates Court on 10 August 2023. It
named the offender as the respondent to the order.
The protected persons named
in the FVO were “CC” and her three children “QN”,
“QM” and “EF”.
is the biological son of the offender. Under the FVO, the offender was
relevantly prohibited from being at the home of the protected
persons, being
within 100 metres of the protected persons, contacting the protected persons,
and engaging in behaviour that constitutes
family violence towards the protected
First Offence
24 November 2023, the offender sent QN the following message over Snapchat (in
reference to sibling contact with her brothers):
You need to be going to contact your 13 start doing what your fucking told stop
worrying bout dick and whatever else is going on
this is a fucking joke. It is
one day out of your busy week that you fucking have you need to start pulling
your fucking head in.
Third Offences
the evening of 4 December 2023, CC and QN were scheduled to have a meeting
outside of a residence in Taylor. QN’s carer,
“NB”, was aware
present and living at the time. CCTV footage captures

residence with the offender one metre behind her.

they are leaving the
conduct was charged separately in relation to each protected person.
around 5:00pm on 15 December 2023, the offender, wearing a balaclava, entered
CC’s home. He walked into CC’s bedroom
and removed the balaclava.
The offender was agitated and aggressive, yelling at CC that he was going to
have the house run through.
He screamed at CC, saying words to the effect of
“QN is a skank, a slut and she is going to get what is coming to
The offender was frothing at the mouth and spitting while he yelled
at CC. He went on to threaten CC that he was going to take EF
and move with him
to Queensland.
was present in CC’s home and heard the confrontation from a separate
offender left CC’s home at about 5:15pm.
31 January 2024, CC received a phone call from a number she did not recognise.
She answered the phone and recognised the voice
on the phone to be that of the
offender. The offender asked CC if police had been at her residence that day, to
which she responded
“yes”. The offender sounded very angry and
proceeded to call CC a “fucking idiot” repeatedly before she hung
the phone. The conduct taken together constitutes the Fourth Offence.
friends. The offender was in his vehicle. He drove
up to the group and slowly
drove past them. The offender hung his head out of the driver’s side
window and yelled at QN, “fuck
you bitch, I’m gonna get you”.
He then drove away.
The court’s task and the
sentencing considerations
will deal with the established legal principles affecting the court’s
discretion briefly. In sentencing the offender for
the driving offences, the
court has at the forefront of its consideration the purposes of sentencing, set
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
), which include (in summary form) making the offender accountable
and denouncing and adequately punishing his conduct, deterring
the offender and
other people from committing the same or similar offences, recognising the harm
done to the victims of the crimes
and the community and promoting the
offender’s rehabilitation.
mandatory relevant considerations set out in s 33 of the
Sentencing Act
have also been considered below insofar as they relate to the offender’s
circumstances, and in accordance with the principle
of individualised justice:
MT v The Queen
[2021] ACTCA 26
17 ACTLR 22
Nature and circumstances of
the offence
(s 33(1)(a) of the
Sentencing Act
consideration of the nature and circumstances of the offences includes an
assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
I referred recently to
the principles guiding that assessment in
[2025] ACTSC 430
[25]-[26]. The court takes an objective approach, with the maximum
penalty for the offence as a yardstick.
regard to contravening an FVO, the mandatory statutory considerations and
features informing the seriousness of the conduct were
also discussed in
at [33]-[38] and are incorporated into these reasons.
First Offence involved contact via text message. The message was threatening
and the contact was with a child (that is, a person
with known vulnerability).
There was a degree of premeditation as the conduct involved typing the message.
Second and Third Offences involved physical breaches of the FVO, with the
offender knowingly being within one metre of one of
the protected persons
involved. Again, there was a degree of pre-meditation as the offender would
have had to travel to the location
of where the protected young person was.
Again, that protected person was someone with known vulnerability (being a
Fourth Offence is objectively the most serious of all the breaches. It involved
the offender physically attending a protected
person’s home and then
telephoning that protected person. The conduct involved two instances, both of
which were threatening
and frightening, although clearly the first instance was
more serious as it was in person in the home of two of the protected persons.
It is thus treated as a rolled-up count, encompassing greater criminality than
that of an individual count (
R v Forrest (No 2)
[2017] ACTSC 83
). There was a degree of pre-meditation in the
offender travelling to the home of a protected person and wearing a balaclava.
Fifth Offence was fleeting but is also of increased seriousness as it includes
the scheduled offences which must be taken into
account (s 33(1)(b) of the
Sentencing Act
). The approach to scheduled offences has been
discussed in
R v Campbell
and applies here. Scheduled offences increase the
objective seriousness of the primary offence.
Victim impact statements
(s 33(1)(f) of the
Sentencing Act
was no victim impact statement before the court in respect of the current
offending. There was a victim impact statement before
the court in respect of
the conduct that was sentenced by way of a suspended sentence.
Plea of guilty
33(1)(j) and 35 of the
Sentencing Act
and assistance to law
enforcement authorities
(ss 33(1)(l) and 36 of the
respect of three of the five offences which were transferred from the
Magistrates Court (First, Second and Third Offences), terms
of imprisonment are
under contemplation. Having regard to the mandatory matters for consideration
under s 35(2) of the
Sentencing Act
, I have exercised the discretion
under s 35(3) of the
Sentencing Act
to reduce the sentence that would
otherwise have been imposed by 25% each because:
(a) The offender pleaded guilty.
(b) The timing of the pleas had significant utilitarian value
Monfries v The Queen
[2014] ACTCA
19 ACTLR 99
(c) The offences are serious, but their gravity is not of a kind where a
percentage-based approach might be considered inappropriate.
respect of the Fourth and Fifth Offences, the prosecution submitted that there
was an overwhelming case, invoking the operation
of s 35(4) of the
. That section mandates that the court must not give a significant
discount for a plea if, based on the established facts, the court
considers that
the prosecution case was overwhelmingly strong. I discussed the applicable
principles at length in
[2023] ACTSC 252
and have applied them
here without repeating them. Given that the primary reason the case was
overwhelming was because of the admissions
made by the offender and such
admissions are relevantly considered also to be a form of assistance to law
enforcement authorities,
in such circumstances, I consider that a combined
discount of 19% is appropriate (comprised of 10% for assistance and 9% for the
pleas of guilty themselves).
Subjective circumstances
of the offender
(s 33(1)(m) of the
Sentencing Act
offender is a 28-year-old man. From the contents of the intensive correction
order assessment report, he had the benefit of a
mostly positive and stable
family environment, until his mother was diagnosed with cancer and ultimately
passed away when he was
17 years of age. This was a momentous event for him
during his formative years. The lack of supervision while the family was
on the health of his mother ultimately produced a degree of
disadvantage, because it led to early drug use, lack of attendance at
the offender becoming a first-time father at a young age.
now resides in Queanbeyan. His contact with his children has been limited by
the FVO which expires on 30 June 2027.
reported that alcohol and drug use contributed to his behaviour (s 33(1)(p) of
Sentencing Act
), as well as not having seen the children for a period
of 11 months. To the extent that this constitutes the offender’s reason
for offending (s 33(1)(v) of the
Sentencing Act
), it really is no excuse.
It cannot be said that the offender was in any way mistaken or did not know
His lack of respect for the terms of the order is
patent from the numerous occasions on which it was breached in various ways.
does have a history of substance use with limited alcohol and drug treatment.
He has since demonstrated a clear commitment to
his recovery in that regard and
engaged in a structured treatment pathway (s 33(1)(t) of the
). Ultimately he was found unsuitable for a drug and alcohol treatment
order for other reasons and that is not now being pursued
on sentence.
Criminal antecedents of
the offender
(s 33(1)(m) of the
Sentencing Act
offender had limited prior criminal history, but was on conditional liberty at
the time of the offending, which is an aggravating
feature. The suspended
sentences were for aggravated common assault, with the victims of those assaults
being among the protected
persons that were then the subject of the breach of
have had regard to the fact that the offender has not re-offended since March
2024, but that may have been assisted by the fact
that the relationship between
the two ceased. In my view, contrary to the offender’s submissions, his
history means that specific
deterrence ought to be given weight in any sentence
to be imposed.
(s 33(1)(w) of
Sentencing Act
read the evidence in its entirety, and taking into account the offender’s
efforts at rehabilitation, I consider there
is a degree of remorse, although I
have not given remorse separate significant weight, noting that remorse was also
expressed in
earlier court proceedings shortly before the current offending

approach to principles of concurrency and accumulation has been set out in
Dawson v The Queen
[2019] ACTCA 9
(and the cases there-cited). Concurrency
considerations operate most strongly for the Second and Third Offences. The
overall structure
also takes into account the number of offences and a
significant adjustment has been made for further concurrency as part of a final
view of the total effective sentence to be imposed.
addition, the period to be served in full-time custody prior to the sentence
then being suspended is the shortest that I consider
to be appropriate to give
effect to the sentencing objectives outlined above, including having regard to
totality considerations
arising from the imposition of any term of imprisonment
following the breaches of the suspended sentences.
sentence is also structured so that there is a lengthy period provided for
supervision. That gives the offender maximum opportunity
to rehabilitate in the
community, through any targeted program addressing family violence that is
considered appropriate.
Disposition
imposition of a term of imprisonment is a sentence of last resort: s 10 of the
Sentencing Act
. The gravity of the offending is such that a term of
imprisonment is the only appropriate outcome here. The offender was found
suitable for an intensive correction order. While I do not disagree with the
contents of that report, given the totality of the
offending and the gravity in
particular of the Fourth Offence, and the breach of the suspended sentences that
must also be accommodated
in the sentencing structure, combined with the fact
that the offender has served very little time in custody to date that might have
otherwise constituted sufficient punishment and denunciation, an intensive
correction order simply would not give sufficient weight
in terms of a sentence
that is proportionate to the gravity of the offending. However, I have borne in
mind that a sentence of imprisonment
should never exceed the minimum that is
necessary to accomplish relevant sentencing
objectives:
[2005] ACTCA 49
Consequences for the
breach of the suspended sentence
principles applying to breaches of suspended sentences have been set out in
numerous cases. I have discussed them in

of the breach

the offending occurred within months of the order being made. There was no
rehabilitation at the time the further offending
occurred. The conduct
constituting the breach was against the very persons that were victims of the
previous offending. Committing
an offence is a serious breach of a good
behaviour order. There were five breaches here. The breach conduct cannot be
said to have
arisen by virtue of mistake or misunderstanding. The underlying
offences which were the subject of the suspended sentences were
each serious.
All of those circumstances lead to the conclusion that here, the cumulative
sentences of two months and 15 days should
be imposed. As they are
chronologically the first offences in time, I will order that those terms be
served first.
