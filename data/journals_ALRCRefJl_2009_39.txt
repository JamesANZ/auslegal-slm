Unscrambling the decline in housing affordability
By Chris Lamont*
Newspapers, radio and television often feature differing opinions as to
the reasons for the decline in housing affordability.
These reasons include: negative gearing, bigger houses, the first home owner
grant, urban sprawl, greedy builders and developers and
the unrealistic
expectations of generation X and Y. In sighting these issues there is a tendency
to rely on the ‘vibe’
of the issue—a concept brought to
prominence by the Australian movie
The Castle.
In reality, no single issue explains the decline in housing affordability.
Like other complex issues, there are multiple factors that
need to be assessed
in detail. Population growth, quantity of existing housing stock, annual
residential construction starts, wage
growth, tax regimes, cost and impact of
regulation, availability of residential infrastructure, and the supply and price
labour are just a few of the issues that impact on affordability.
What is clear is that the decline in affordability is closely related to
restrictions in housing supply (as demand for housing grows).
A snapshot across Australian capital cities shows a disparate situation in
respect to property taxes, infrastructure charges and planning
surprisingly there is an inverse relationship between the quantum of these taxes
and charges and housing affordability.
For example, a house and land package in
Sydney worth $550,000 comprises taxes and charges levied by the federal, state
governments in the order of $140,000. The same house and land package
in Adelaide is subject to $42,000 in taxes and charges.
This example provides part of the explanation on the supply side of the
equation. The other factor is the different planning schemes
that exist in each
Queensland planning schemes mean
it takes at least twice as long (on average) to
prepare a new residential development. The impact of delays in these states mean
that holding and associated costs in the order of $30,000 are incurred for each
new dwelling, pushing the price just that much further
out of reach for many
first home buyers.
Why is it important to examine the supply of new housing in explaining the
issues associated with housing affordability? Because without
an efficient
supply of new housing a growing population is forced to compete for existing
housing stock.
The bulk of the house price boom occurred between 1999 and 2004. The median
house price for the period rose by 67% (after general
inflation) or $162,300.
During this period there was strong wage growth and very strong growth in
Australia’s population, driven
primarily by immigration.
Immigration, particularly skilled immigration, remains a necessary and
important measure required to drive the Australian economy,
but unfortunately
there has been little attempt to assess the net size of Australia’s net
annual immigration programs and the
corresponding impact on housing demand. A
detailed and accurate assessment would look at all forms of immigration (both
and permanent) and assess the corresponding level of housing
Australia’s private rental market has a national vacancy rate
approximating 1.5%. Many experts would consider 3% to be the market
rate. In view of the record low in private rental vacancy rates, it is hardly
surprising that rents have grown over the
past four years at a rate of more than
10% in most capital cities.
Some say the increase in house prices (and thereby rents) is due to investors
taking advantage of negative gearing and other taxation
incentives. But
investment in the private rental market has declined in recent years despite
falling vacancies and growing yields.
If negative gearing is a cash bonanza for
property investors in the private rental market, why have private investors not
growing demand for private rental accommodation?
Econometric assessments undertaken by ACIL Tasman and the Housing Industry
Association (HIA) have looked at the impact of a range
of tax changes on
property prices including negative gearing. The study concluded that the impact
of negative gearing on house prices
was statistically insignificant. This was in
contrast to the impact of restrictive and complex planning and zoning policies,
were found to have driven up the price of land and artificially
constrained the supply of housing in both infill and outer areas.
The combination of restrictive planning and onerous tax and charging regimes
has stifled investment and the supply of new housing.
This has occurred over a
number of years and today there is a chronic shortage of housing. The National
Housing Supply Council, established
by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, was tasked
with assessing the current shortage of housing and identifying the expected
shortage to
the year 2020. The Council’s first report conservatively
estimated a national housing shortage of
Of some concern is the Council’s projection on the shortage of housing
over the next few years. Based on a medium demand and
supply assumption, the
supply gap in housing is expected to grow by 46,000 dwellings in the next two
years. By 2013 the Council estimates
Australia will be 203,000 dwellings short
of required demand.
This projected
shortage, if realised, will have significant implications, not just for vacancy
rates and housing affordability, but
also for the number of homeless
Australians.
The above estimates should then be viewed against predictions of 30–40%
reductions in house prices. There are those who refer
to what happened to house
prices in the United States and conclude that the Australian housing market is
prices will soon experience wholesale price
reductions. Those seeking to use the US as a reference for making projections
future of Australian house prices would be well advised to look at the
oversupply that existed in the US housing market immediately
prior to the drop
in prices and the relatively stringent lending requirements that exist in
Housing affordability has improved in Australia in 2009, but this has not
occurred on account of a drop in house prices. Indeed there
is some evidence to
suggest that house prices in the ‘entry level’ segment of the market
have experienced some modest
price growth in certain areas of Australia.
Significant reductions in interest rates have delivered improvements in
housing affordability for owner occupiers. The HIA–Commonwealth
First Home Buyer Affordability Report
revealed a 14.6%
improvement in affordability for the March 2009 quarter, which came hot on the
heels of a 40% improvement at the
end of 2008. The primary contributing factor
in this improvement is the 4% saving in the standard variable mortgage rate.
In the longer term, however, further reductions in interest rates will not
sustain the improvement in affordability. Interest rates
have reached the end of
the downward cycle and upward pressure is already being experienced.
Addressing supply shortages and bottlenecks is the only means of providing an
acceptable level of housing affordability. For many
it will be obvious: unless
the supply of housing roughly approximates the level of housing demand there
will be a price movement.
For more than a decade in Australia, housing demand has exceeded supply. The
National Housing Supply Council predicts that this will
continue and hence the
prospects for housing affordability in the year 2020 are sobering.
There is not only a requirement to boost the supply of housing to address
housing affordability, but in the current economic climate
there are employment
and economic benefits. No other industry sector can generate as much activity or
employment as quickly as the
residential construction industry. Activity in the
sector provides employment in manufacturing, law, business, sales, and of
construction.
Removing onerous tax and charging regimes is the first step in providing more
affordable housing. Improving planning, land supply
and zoning processes will
also increase both the number of new residential dwellings constructed and
housing affordability.
The most unaffordable housing in Australia is generally found in areas that
have the most complicated and inefficient planning systems,
high levels of
taxation and infrastructure charging on housing. Unless these issues are
addressed, affordable housing for many Australians
will be nothing more than a
pipe dream.
