J D Burns, Deputy President
Dr Gerard Ingram is a medical
practitioner who has practised as a dermatologist for at least 20 years. He
obtained his qualifications
in medicine from the
in 1962 and later was awarded the Diploma from the American Board of
Dermatology in 1986. He has recently been appointed a life
member of the
of Dermatologists, an honour
that has previously been granted to only about 10 Australians.
In July 2005 the
Professionals Act 2004
(ACT) (the Act) came into effect, regulating many
aspects of the medical profession, including the registration of specialist
practitioners. Before the commencement of the Act there had been no
formal recognition or regulation of medical specialties in the
ACT. It appears
that regulation of those claiming entitlement to practise as a specialist
medical practitioner was the responsibility
of the various medical Colleges,
with overarching responsibility for registration of medical practitioners
generally, being the
responsibility of the Medical Board under the
Practitioners Act 1930
These loose arrangements changed
significantly with the commencement of the Act. The Act provides for
registration of members of
the various health professions to which the Act
applies by registration with the relevant health profession board, in this case
the ACT Medical Board. The
Health Professionals Regulation 2004
(the Regulation) provides for the recognition of specialist areas of medical
practice and specifies requirements to be met
by a medical practitioner seeking
registration in one of the designated specialties.
In March 2006 Dr Ingram applied to the
ACT Medical Board for registration as a specialist dermatologist. The Board
declined to register
Dr Ingram as a specialist on the grounds that he did not
meet the criteria for registration set out in the Regulation. Dr Ingram
applied for review of that decision pursuant to
of the Act. On such
an application the Health Professions Tribunal may exercise the functions given
to the Medical Board by the
Act as if the Medical Board�s decision had not been
made. In practical terms this means that I may determine, if appropriate, that
Dr Ingram meets the requirement for registration as a dermatologist.
A panel was not formed to hear the
application. All parties, including the Medical Board, consented to my
exercising the power of
the tribunal alone: see
section 44(1)(d)
of the Act.
particular importance to the present application is
regulation 2.4:
Specialist areas and suitability to
practise requirements � Act,
Each of the areas mentioned in table 2.4, column 2 is a
specialist area.
Each of the areas mentioned in table 2.4, column 3 is a
sub-specialist area of the specialist area to which it relates.
A person meets the requirements for registration in a
specialist area of medicine if �
the person �
is registered under the Act; and
has a qualification mentioned in table 2.4, column 4 in
a specialist area of medicine mentioned in column 2; or
the person �
graduated in medicine, whether from an Australian
institution, or otherwise; and
holds a qualification in a specialist area of medicine
awarded by an educational institution outside
the qualification is approved in writing by an entity
accredited by the Australian Medical Council, or an entity established to regulate
the medical profession under a corresponding law of a local jurisdiction.
A reference in subsection (3)(a)(ii) to a qualification

) mentioned in table 2.4, column 4 in a
specialist area of medicine includes a reference to a qualification �
awarded before the current qualification was first
awarded; and
that the board is satisfied was, at the time it was
awarded, an adequate qualification for admission to the specialist area.
Insofar as it is relevant, Table 2.4

Fellowship of
Australasian
of Dermatologists
Regulation 2.4 therefore provides two
pathways for registration as a dermatologist. The first is by virtue of
regulation 2.4 (3)(a).
In order to achieve registration via this pathway it
must be established that Dr Ingram is registered under the Act and is a fellow
Australasian
Dermatologists. Registered under the Act, for present purposes, means
registered as a health professional within the relevant
health profession. The
evidence before me demonstrates that Dr Ingram is registered under the Act as a
medical practitioner, but
he does not hold fellowship of the
Australasian
of Dermatologists. It appears that the
Australasian
of Dermatologists does not recognise the Diploma from the American Board of
Dermatology as a basis for fellowship of their College.
Accordingly,
registration by virtue of regulation 2.4(a) is not available to Dr Ingram.
The second path to registration as a
dermatologist is that set out in regulation 2.4 (3)(b). For registration under
this pathway
Dr Ingram must establish that he graduated in medicine, holds a
qualification in a specialist area of medicine awarded by an educational
institution outside Australia and that that qualification is approved in
writing by an entity accredited by the Australian Medical
Council, or an entity
established to regulate the medical profession under a corresponding law of a
local jurisdiction. The phrase
�corresponding law�, insofar as it relates to
the phrase �local jurisdiction� is defined in the Dictionary to the Act as �a
of that jurisdiction that corresponds to this Act�. The phrase �local
, but does not include
the ACT�. The word �State� is defined in the Dictionary to the
Legislation
(ACT) as meaning �a State of the Commonwealth, and includes the
Northern Territory
There is no dispute Dr Ingram graduated
in medicine. As I noted earlier, he graduated from the University of Melbourne
Similarly there is no dispute that he holds a qualification in a
specialist area of medicine awarded by an educational institution
Australia, being the Diploma from the American Board of Dermatology. The
significant issue for determination in this application
is whether he satisfies
any of the criteria in
regulation 2.4(3)(b)(iii).
The parties both accept, as I understand
it, that Dr Ingram�s Diploma from the American Board of Dermatology has not
been approved
in writing by an entity accredited by the Australian Medical
Dr Ingram�s contention, as I understand
it, is that his qualification has been approved in writing by an entity
established to regulate
the medical profession under a corresponding law of a
local jurisdiction. Dr Ingram�s submission is encapsulated in his letter to
Tribunal dated 5 March 2007:
�My qualification was approved
and recognised by the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee
which was the only entity
established to recognise specialist qualifications
and predates the Australian Medical Council. This is not as Mr Bradford states
specialist status conferred by Medicare Australia. Specialist status was
conferred by NASQAC whose committee was composed by representatives
medical boards�.�
Limited information is available on the
genesis and operation of the National Specialist Qualification Advisory
Committee (NSQAC),
which ceased existence some time ago. The only evidence I
have relating to the genesis of NSQAC is information contained in publications
published by NSQAC between 1973 and 1977, to which I will refer in greater
detail hereunder. That material suggests that NSQAC
was formed in 1972 as part
of an initiative under the
National Health Act 1970
, a Commonwealth
enactment. As a Commonwealth enactment, the
National Health Act
not qualify as a �corresponding law of a local jurisdiction� because such laws
are defined as laws of a State (not the Commonwealth)
that correspond to the
Professionals Act
. There is no evidence that NSQAC was established by a law
of a State corresponding to the Act. Such evidence as exists suggests
was not so established.
This finding, in itself, is sufficient to
dispose of Dr Ingram�s submission. However, there is another reason why his
cannot succeed. To satisfy the requirements of
2.4(3)(b)(iii)
, NSQAC must be an entity established
to regulate
medical profession. The evidence before me suggests that was not its function.
NSQAC published a number of booklets between
1973 and 1977, each entitled
�Lists of Recommended Medical Specialties and Postgraduate Qualifications�. In
the foreword to each
of these publications the chairman of NSQAC sounded the
following warning:
It must be emphasised that
the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee has no jurisdiction
over the powers embodied
in the State and Federal legislation. The Committee
acts in an advisory capacity only. The final responsibility for the granting
registration or recognition of a specialist remains solely with the appropriate
authority in the State or Territory of Australia
in which the practitioner
establishes his practice
publications provided information about NSQAC:
The administration of medical
practice within Australia is the prime responsibility of the six State
Governments. These Governments
have established Medical Boards to administer
the provisions of the respective legislation relating to the registration of
qualified persons as medical practitioners. Similarly, provision is
also made within the Territories of Australia for registration
practitioners.
of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia (the latter to a
limited extent) have, in addition, established
legislation for the registration
of medical practitioners as specialist medical practitioners.
In 1970 the
Federal Government made provision within the National Health Scheme for payment
of medical benefits at higher rates
for medical services when rendered by
specialist medical practitioners. However, in doing so the Government
recognised that in
the absence of comprehensive registration of specialists it
would be necessary to provide necessary machinery for recognition of
specialists for the purposes of the National Health Scheme. To this end
provision was made in the
National Health Act 1970
for the establishment of
Specialist Recognition Committees.
National Health Act
of 1970 a Specialist Recognition Advisory Committee was
established in each State. A Specialist Recognition Appeal Committee was
established. The function of these Committees is to determine whether
individual medical practitioners should be granted recognition
as specialists
for the purposes of the Act.
existence of both Federal and State bodies empowered to either grant
recognition or register medical practitioners as specialists
there existed a
situation whereby there was a lack of uniformity in the acceptance of
appropriate specialist medical qualification
(both Australian and overseas) and
specialist branches of medicine.
absence of such uniformity it was considered most desirable that a National
advisory body should be constituted to provide
advice on qualifications and
branches of medicine to all registering or recognizing bodies. Preliminary
discussions were therefore
held with the respective bodies to investigate
avenues of attaining a level of uniformity in these matters.
Establishment of National Body
As a result
of these preliminary discussions a meeting of the Presidents/Chairmen of the
Medical Boards together with representatives
of the Federal Specialist
Recognition Committees was held on 15 June 1972 to consider the establishment
of a National body to carry
out the task of working towards uniformity in these
The meeting
of 15 June 1972 agreed to the establishment of National Specialist
Qualification Advisory Committee and a Working Committee.
It was decided that
the National Committee would meet annually, and the Working Committee would
meet throughout the year to prepare
and assess material for the consideration
of the National Committee. Secretarial assistance for both Committees to be

To consider other matters relevant to
1 and 2 above
Reference to the
(as amended by the
National Health Act 1970
) reveals that,
consistent with the extract above, the provision creating the Specialist
Recognition Advisory Committees in each
of the States and Territories is found
in that part of the
National Health Act
dealing with medical benefits
payable by the Commonwealth. The scheme of the
National Health Act 1953
as amended, makes it abundantly clear that the role of the Committees, and of
the Specialist Recognition Appeal Committee set
up to hear appeals from decisions
of the Committees, was to determine whether a medical practitioner was a
specialist for the purpose
of determining benefits payable under that Act.
As noted in the extract, NSQAC sprang
from those State and Territory committees in an effort to achieve national
uniformity. But
the stream cannot rise higher than its source, and the purpose
for which NSQAC endeavoured to achieve this uniformity was the same
purpose for
which the State and Territory Committees were formed, to determine specialist
status for the purpose of determining
benefits payable by the Commonwealth. As
such NSQAC was not an entity established to regulate the medical profession, at
not in a way that corresponds to the regulation of the profession by the
Professionals Act
For better or worse, the Legislative
Assembly has determined that strictly prescribed criteria must be met before a
medical practitioner
may be registered as a specialist dermatologist in the
ACT. The legislature has left no discretion in the Medical Board or this
tribunal to allow registration in what might appear to be deserving cases which
do not fall neatly into the categories provided
in the Act and the Regulation.
Whether this is appropriate, fair or desirable is a matter for the legislature
and the relevant
Before concluding, there are matters that
should be mentioned. First, the material before me establishes that on 29 June
Medical Board provided Dr Ingram with a certificate certifying that he
was registered under the
Medical Practitioners Act 1930
dermatologist. Unfortunately, this fact does not assist Dr Ingram in this
application. There was no legislative scheme in
existence under the
Practitioners Act
for registration of practitioners as specialists. In any
event, whatever opinion the Medical Board may have had about Dr Ingram�s
as a specialist dermatologist before the commencement of the
Professionals Act
is irrelevant to determining whether Dr Ingram satisfies
any of the criteria for registration as a specialist dermatologist under
Act and the Regulation.
Medical Practitioners Act 1930
(ACT) cannot
be a corresponding law of a local jurisdiction for the purposes of
2.4(3)(b)(iii)
because it is a law of the ACT and such laws are specifically
excluded from consideration.
Secondly, after the hearing of the
application I received a letter from Dr Ingram raising some issues about the
reference, as I
understand it, to the
Medical Practitioners Act 1930
the course of the proceedings on 5 September. Dr Ingram�s further submission
was based on the assumption that the
Medical Practitioner�s Act 1930
a Commonwealth Act, which it was not.
The Medical Practitioner�s Act 1930
was originally the
Medical Practitioners Ordinance 1930
, a Commonwealth
ordinance. However, it subsequently became an ACT enactment after self
government. Dr Ingram queries whether, after
self government, it was the
intention of the Act to exclude from the definition of a State the self
governing territories including
the ACT. The simple answer is, as I noted
earlier, that the
Legislation Act 2001
, an ACT enactment made after self
government, defines the term State, when used in ACT legislation, as �a state
of the Commonwealth,
and includes the Northern Territory�. Clearly enough, this
definition does not include the ACT, and, in any event, the ACT is specifically
excluded from the definition of a �local jurisdiction� for the purposes of
regulation 2.4(3)(b)(iii).
In these circumstances I have no
alternative other than to confirm the decision of the Medical Board.
I certify that this and the preceding 6
pages are a true copy of the decision
and reasons for decision herein of
Mr J D Burns, Deputy President.
