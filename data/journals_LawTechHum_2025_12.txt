Narratives, Frontier Technologies, and the Law (Part II):
Feminist Turn in Law and Technology

Framing Technological Futures
In the first decades of the twenty-first century, technological innovation
has outpaced the most vivid imaginations of earlier generations.
intelligence (AI) now shapes our daily communications and decisions; blockchain
challenges traditional financial systems;
biotechnology redraws the boundaries
between human and machine.
These frontier technologies—innovations characterised by rapid
evolution and profound social and economic impacts—test
our technical
abilities and challenge fundamental legal and ethical concepts. Yet, amid this
storm of change, the ancient force of
human storytelling continues to exert a
subtle yet profound influence over the development of technology as well as
reactions to emerging
technologies.
As a social practice, the law is, at its core, a tapestry of
narratives.
Statutes, precedents,
and constitutions are, in this sense, stories we tell about order, justice, and
the limits of power. Likewise,
technology is often introduced and understood as
a story: from the Promethean myth of stolen fire to modern Silicon
vision of ‘disruption.’ Narratives define what is
thinkable, what is desirable, and, importantly, what is permissible.
Legal responses to new technologies are seldom, if ever, rational. Instead,
they are shaped within the collective imagination through
utopian promises and
dystopian warnings (Mary Shelley’s
Frankenstein
, or Margaret Atwood’s
The Handmaid’s
) as well as the lived experiences of affected communities. The stories
we tell about technology influence the regulatory frameworks
we develop,
affecting everything from the language of statutes to judicial reasoning and
public perception.
Yet every act of storytelling (legal or otherwise) raises a fundamental
question: who gets to tell the story? The narratives that
shape law and
technology are never neutral; they reflect the perspectives, priorities, and
positions of those empowered to speak.
Historically, legal and technological
storytelling has privileged certain voices, often centring male experiences as
universal, while
marginalising or erasing
Inspired by Donna Haraway’s
provocations,
this introduction
brings attention to the politics of narrative authorship—how the inclusion
or exclusion of women and other
marginalised groups profoundly shapes the
stories we inherit, the rules we make, and the futures we imagine. The challenge
only to examine what stories are told about frontier technologies but
also to question whose stories are heard, whose are silenced,
and how power
circulates in the very act of narration.
2. Narratives as Drivers of Legal Change
Narratives serve a dual purpose in law: they are both objects and tools of
legal reasoning. Legislators and judges use stories to
justify decisions;
lawyers employ narratives to persuade courts and the public; and citizens turn
to stories to understand their
legal rights and duties in an increasingly
complex world.
These narratives shape public expectations, direct regulatory priorities, and
even impact the design of liability frameworks. For
instance, in data privacy
regulation, the story of the ‘omniscient algorithm’ versus the
‘empowered data subject’
reflects the tension between approaches
favouring statutory protections and those relying on industry
self-regulation.
Recognising the foundational role of narratives encourages an
interdisciplinary approach to legal scholarship. Insights from literature,
philosophy, sociology, and media studies highlight how technological narratives
circulate, gain legitimacy, and influence legal regimes.
Additionally, empirical research into the reception and impact of
technological narratives can deepen our understanding of legal design
regulatory adaptation. How do different communities perceive the risks and
benefits of a new technology? Which stories resonate,
and why? How do
counternarratives from marginalised or dissenting voices challenge dominant
legal paradigms?
3. Frontier Technologies as Legal Challenges
The rapid progress of frontier technologies poses unique challenges to legal
systems, which are often slow to
Legal doctrines based on
tangible property, clear causation, and human agency commonly struggle to
comprehend the fluid, multi-layered
nature of digital assets, decentralised
networks, and autonomous agents.
Narratives can serve as mediating tools during these moments of conceptual
rupture. They help lawyers, judges, and lawmakers bridge
the gap between old and
new paradigms by offering analogies, metaphors, and interpretative frameworks.
For instance, the ‘blockchain
as trust machine’ narrative has helped
advocate for recognising decentralised ledgers in fields as diverse as finance,
intellectual
property, and voting
The narrative of electric
vehicles as inherently ‘green’ technology has influenced regulatory
incentives and public policy
on transportation and
Similarly, the ‘AI
as co-author’ narrative is beginning to influence debates around copyright
and creativity.
At the same time, the growth of competing narratives can lead to regulatory
fragmentation and uncertainty. Different jurisdictions
may adopt opposing legal
approaches to the same technologydepending on which narratives most strongly
resonate with policymakers,
courts, and the public. Therefore, the study of
narratives is not merely academic; it is crucial to understanding and guiding
global governance of frontier technologies.
4. Beyond Androcentric Storytelling
Narratives are not harmless. They can reinforce bias, sustain inequalities,
and hide the experiences of marginalised groups. In big
data, for instance,
dominant stories about ‘objective’ or ‘neutral’
algorithms often conceal the reality
of embedded systemic
Law must remain
critically aware of the power of narratives, not only as a means of progress but
also as a potential source of harm.
Feminist legal theorists have long demonstrated that legal narratives are
never neutral; they both reflect and reinforce existing
structures.
Dominant legal
stories often centre on male experiences as universal, framing women’s and
marginalised groups’ realities
as deviations or
exceptions.
This dominant
approach sustains systemic exclusions by obscuring how laws are built upon
androcentric assumptions about rationality,
autonomy, and justice.
Feminist critiques warn that such narratives legitimise patriarchal norms
while silencing alternative voices, reinforcing structural
biases in areas
ranging from criminal
responsibility
to reproductive
The danger lies not
only in what the law says, but also in whose stories it tells and whose it
erases—perpetuating inequalities
under the guise of
objectivity.
Theoretical perspectives, such as those advanced by Judith Butler, sharpen
this critique. Butler’s work illustrates that gender
and identity are not
inherent or static, but continually constructed and enforced through discourse,
performance, and institutional
In this sense, the
law’s claims to objectivity and universality are themselves performative
acts—rituals that reinforce
existing power relations by presenting
particular perspectives as natural or
Butler’s approach also exposes how narratives not only shape what is
thinkable or sayable, but also determine whose experiences
are rendered visible
and whose are erased.
insistence on neutrality, so often invoked in technological innovation and its
regulation, serves to obscure the situated, gendered,
and frequently
exclusionary character of their underlying narratives.
A genuinely inclusive scholarship in law and technology must, therefore,
interrogate not just the content of positive regulation but
performative effects—asking who is authorised to speak, whose lives are
made legible, and how the repeated performance
of ‘neutral’ legal
storytelling serves to entrench structural inequalities. In this light, the
inclusion of women’s
perspectives becomes essential, not merely as a
corrective, but as a fundamental reorientation of the legal and technological
that shape our societies.
Recognising these dynamics underscores why the inclusion of women’s
perspectives is essential to a more just and comprehensive
legal scholarship.
Their contributions offer another layer of analytical depth often absent from
traditional, male-dominated accounts
of narratives, frontier technologies, and
Too often, women’s distinct experiences and contributions remain
underrepresented in scholarship about law and technology. Addressing
imbalance is essential for developing genuinely inclusive and critical legal
scholarship. Incorporating women’s voices
enriches the exploration of
legal, ethical, and societal impacts of technological advances, allowing for a
more nuanced appraisal
of how technology, law, and society interact.
It is important to recognise that meaningful inclusion does not require every
woman’s contribution to focus explicitly on feminism
or gender critique.
Valuing women’s scholarship means engaging with the full range of their
intellectual work, whether or not
it centres on gender issues. All featured
articles in this volume are authored by women, offering a range of perspectives
both within
and beyond feminist critique. This diversity itself enriches the
field, demonstrating that inclusion involves amplifying their voices
recognising the breadth and depth of their contributions.
5. Overview of Featured Articles
The first featured article,
Rewriting the Narrative of AI Bias: A Data
Feminist Critique of Algorithmic Inequalities in Healthcare
, critically examines how AI bias in healthcare is framed within
legal and regulatory narratives, particularly focusing on the EU
argues that AI bias is not merely a technical flaw, but a structural issue
rooted in historical exclusions and androcentric
medical epistemologies that
prioritise white male bodies as the norm. This discrimination leads to
systemic misdiagnosis and healthcare
disparities affecting marginalised groups
such as women, racial minorities, disabled individuals, and low-income
The article criticises current regulatory approaches, such as the EU AI Act,
for treating AI bias as a technical flaw rather than
addressing the more
profound structural inequalities embedded in healthcare AI systems. It argues
that measures like risk classifications
and biased audits often reinforce
androcentric, racialised, and neoliberal exclusions without ensuring
intersectional accountability.
Drawing on legal narrative theory, intersectionality, socio-legal critiques
of androcentricity, and abolitionist AI perspectives,
the article challenges
dominant legal framings that portray bias as fixable through technical
compliance alone. Instead, it advocates
for data feminism, which centres on
power analysis, amplifies marginalised voices, rethinks binary categories,
embraces complexity,
prioritises justice, and recognises data’s
non-neutrality, promoting participatory and accountable AI governance.
Ultimately,
the article calls for transforming AI governance narratives to
dismantle structural injustices and ensure AI promotes structural
justice rather
than simply mitigating bias within existing oppressive systems.
Olga Pandos
, in her article,
The Impact of Narratives on the
Legal and Regulatory Discourse of Heritable Human Genome Editing
investigates how narratives play a crucial role in shaping the legal and
regulatory discussion on Heritable Human Genome Editing
(HHGE). It argues that
decisions regarding HHGE are not solely scientific or technical but are heavily
influenced by how these technologies
are framed within ethical, legal, and
societal narratives. By applying narrative theory, the article shows that
reframing HHGE can
open pathways for its moral and legal acceptance in certain
circumstances.
Using Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD) as a focused case study and applying the
principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice,
the article
argues that genome editing to prevent fatal monogenic genetic diseases is
ethically justified, as such interventions
uphold human dignity and promote
future welfare by removing untreatable conditions from genetic lineages. While
acknowledging risks
such as off-target effects, mosaicism, and unknown long-term
impacts, it contends these do not outweigh the benefits in cases involving
diseases, provided regulation and precautionary measures are in place.
Critiquing Australia’s blanket bans, the article advocates nuanced
regulatory approaches that allow ethically justified uses
of HHGE to prevent
suffering and promote intergenerational justice. It concludes that narrative
theory offers a valuable lens for
shaping balanced and ethical legal frameworks,
framing genome editing as a means of justice rather than merely a risky
technology,
and calls for ongoing ethical analysis, public dialogue, and case
study evaluations to guide responsible HHGE development.
Valentina Golunova’s
A Misogynistic Glitch? A
Feminist Critique of Algorithmic Content Moderation
examines the role of
AI in social media content moderation from a feminist perspective. It
traces how the narrative around algorithmic
content moderation has evolved from
focusing on efficiency and cost-effectiveness to claims that AI can foster more
inclusive and
diverse online discourse. However, the article argues that
these optimistic claims are misguided.
The article examines how algorithmic content moderation and platform
governance sustain gender hierarchies by reinforcing gender norms
and failing to
address online misogyny, thereby marginalising women’s voices. It
emphasises that AI tools mirror societal gender
biases due to the
under-representation of women and marginalised groups in AI development, which
leads to discriminatory outcomes
and algorithmic oppression.
Reviewing automated removal, deplatforming, and content demotion measures,
the article finds that AI often struggles to detect subtle
gender-based
violence, incorrectly restricts legitimate women’s speech, and diminishes
their public participation. The piece
criticises platforms’ emphasis on
business models that prioritise engagement, which amplify misogynistic content,
while opaque
moderation practices, like shadow banning, silence women further.
While recognising AI’s potential, the article suggests
user-customisable tools and structural reforms to reduce biases, concluding
AI-driven moderation has yet to realise its promise of fostering inclusive, fair
online spaces for women, thus calling for a
critical reassessment of
technological and governance frameworks.
Despoina Farmaki’s
User-Generated Content in
Gaming: Legal Challenges and Narrative Frameworks
studies how the growth
of the video game industry, driven by user-generated content (UGC) and live
streaming, raises complex legal
and regulatory challenges, particularly
concerning copyright enforcement and user rights, highlighting the need for
transparent,
equitable, and adaptable End User License Agreements (EULAs).
The study finds a significant lack of scholarly and legal analysis on
user-generated content (UGC) in video games, revealing the need
to clarify the
complex tensions between user creativity and intellectual property protection.
It highlights wide variations in company
policies on screenshots and game
photography, with some permitting it freely, others prohibiting it, and some
allowing it under conditions.
In contrast, many companies permit UGC monetisation but impose safeguards to
maintain game integrity and community standards. The
research shows that
official guidelines for gameplay approval can impact game sales and argues that
explicit fair use provisions
in EULAs would empower creators without legal fear.
Furthermore, it critiques the European legal discourse for leaving UGC in a
‘tolerated infringement’ state lacking strong protection,
emphasising that EULAs must be clear, equitable, and adaptable
to emerging
technologies like Web 3.0 and the Metaverse.
6. Final Remarks
As the law confronts the challenges and opportunities of frontier
technologies, narratives will remain an indispensable lens for analysis
action. By foregrounding stories—both the ones we inherit and the ones we
create—legal scholarship can better anticipate
technological disruption,
craft more responsive regulatory frameworks, and promote justice in a changing
The ethical implications of storytelling in law and technology are
significant. But whose stories are told, and whose are silenced?
How can the law
promote more inclusive and diverse narratives, especially in areas marked by
structural inequalities? The answers
to these questions will influence not only
the future of technological progress but also the legitimacy and effectiveness
systems in the digital era.
As made evident by the articles included within this symposium, incorporating
women’s perspectives is more than just promoting
gender balance; it
involves a fundamental re-examination of the assumptions, values, and power
structures that influence the development
and implementation of frontier
technologies.
Legal scholars and practitioners bear the responsibility to analyse the
narratives underpinning their work, identify overlooked perspectives,
critical literacy among the broader public. This responsibility is particularly
urgent in emerging technological domains,
where the stakes—economic,
social, and existential—are unprecedented, and women’s
perspectives—representing
half the global population—must not be
overlooked.
It is crucial for us to continue scrutinising the influences and thought
patterns that shape rapidly evolving technologies in order
to steer their
direction and applications effectively. The lack of diverse voices in shaping
technological and legal frameworks risks
sustaining existing inequalities and
creating new forms of discrimination. Diverse viewpoints are vital for
identifying and addressing
potential gender biases within technological
