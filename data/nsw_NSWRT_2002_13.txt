RESIDENTIAL TRIBUNAL
: Hollier &
Forrester (Tenants)
Bond (Landlords)
APPEARANCES
: Ms Hollier, tenant and Mr
Bond, landlord in person
: 16 November 2001 at
FINDINGS AND ORDERS
On 16 November 2001 the Tribunal having heard the evidence of the parties
made the following findings:
A. That having regard
to the condition of the carpet at commencement of the tenancy on 18 December
1995, and allowing for fair wear
and tear, the tenants should pay an amount of
$25.00 toward the landlords’ cost of carpet cleaning at the end of the
B. The tenants conceded that in removing posters from bedrooms
at the end of the tenancy some paint was removed form the walls. Having
to the condition of the walls at the commencement of the tenancy and allowing
for depreciation, the tenants should contribute
the sum of $50.00 towards the
landlords’ costs of painting at the premises;
C. The tenants stated
that they had spent 2 days cleaning the premises but admitted that blinds were
not cleaned as well as they should
have been and vanity and exhaust fan were not
cleaned. Having regard to the state of cleanliness of the premises at the
commencement
of the tenancy, the tenants should contribute the sum of $30.00
towards the landlords’ cost of cleaning the premises;
landlords did not establish that they were entitled to compensation for repairs
and changing of locks.
E. The notice of increase in rent from $165.00
per week to $175.00 per week from 9 July 2000 gave less than 60 days notice of
increase and thus does not comply with
Residential
Tenancies Act
. In the result the rent increase is not payable by the
tenants and a rental credit is to be given to the tenants for the additional
$10.00 per week paid since July 2000.
F. The parties are in dispute as
to the rental payments made over the 5.75 years tenancy. The Tribunal did not
have time on 16 November
2001 to check all of the records provided by the
parties as to rental payments made from November 1995 to September 2001.
Accordingly,
the Tribunal reserved its decision upon the application pending
consideration of the evidence of the parties as to rental payments
additional rental payments the landlords are entitled to, if any, in lieu of
1. On 16 November 2001 the proceedings were
adjourned pending the Tribunal’s determination.
On 3 January
2002 the Tribunal made the following further findings and
G. The Tribunal finds that the tenants are
entitled to a rental credit of $630.00 being the additional $10.00 per week
increase paid
for 63 weeks.
After allowing for rent owing to 24 September
2001 this credit is reduced to $572.14.
The Tribunal is not satisfied
that the comments of Mrs Bond, one of the landlords, was sufficient to absolve
the tenants from giving
21 days notice of their intention to vacate the
premises. As the tenants only gave 6 days notice, the landlords are entitled to
compensation of $353.57 (15 days at $165.00 per week) in lieu of
After setting off the amount in paragraph I above against the
tenants’ rental credit of $572.14, there remains a credit of $158.57
favour of the tenants.
In order to bring finality to the dispute between
the parties and avoid the need for the tenants to bring separate proceedings to
recover the amount in paragraph J above, the Tribunal is of the view that the
rental credit in paragraph J above of $158.57 should
be set off against the
compensation of $105.00 payable to the landlords for cleaning and painting.
As the tenants’ rental credit exceeds the compensation payable to
the landlords by a small amount, the Tribunal finds that the
landlords are not
entitled to any payment from the Rental Bond.
Rental Bond Board is directed to pay Rental Bond 5340888-3 to the tenants.
