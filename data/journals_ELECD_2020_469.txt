Abstract/Description:
China’s proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 has proven to be a milestone event. It is the first country-driven
initiative after the US-led Marshall Plan of 1948 to attract considerable attention among stakeholders worldwide, including states,
private-sector actors, academics, and national and international institutions. This chapter explores the BRI’s interface with
multilateral development banks (MDBs), primarily the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the
Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank and the European Investment Bank. These
six MDBs signed a historic joint Memorandum of Understanding with China on 14 May 2017 (China-MDBs MOU) to support the BRI. After
an introductory section, the chapter discusses the BRI’s cooperation with various sectors, including MDBs. It then analyzes
the China-MDBs MOU and the responses from these MDBs, and shows that through the MOU China is contributing to global governance with
MDB support by promoting connectivity networks and sustainable development. It also discusses how the MDBs’ BRI-related projects,
programs, and other activities relate to their economic development mandates. The chapter summarizes the varied approaches taken
by these MDBs, and assesses whether other, complementary approaches could also be taken to support the BRI. It then provides recommendations
for how these MDBs can move forward in maintaining their support for the BRI to promote economic growth and strengthen international
cooperation and global governance. It also discusses how China can increase MDBs’ support for the BRI and gain further support
for it through international organizations like the United Nations Development Programme. A final section draws the chapter’s
conclusions.
