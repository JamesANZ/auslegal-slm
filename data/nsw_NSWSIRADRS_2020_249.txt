Dr Diep provided a further diagnosis:
“1. Cerebral concussion, 2. Cervical strain 3. Left shoulder
girdle strain, 4. Left shoulder supraspinatus tendinosis (sic)
and subdeltoid
bursitis. 5. Upper back strain 6. Low back strain 7. Right knee soft tissue
injury, prepatellar hematoma/bursitis
8. Left leg soft tissue
9 March 2020
At this stage, the diagnosis was:

and subdeltoid
bursitis. 5. Upper back strain 6. Low back strain 7. Right knee soft tissue
injury, prepatellar hematoma/bursitis
8. Left leg soft tissue injury. New:
tingling from neck to left hand ? cervical radiculopathy.”
27 March 2020
A cervical MRI stated:
“At C3-4 level, broad based osteophyte with left paramedian
prominence compressing the cord. There is no nerve compression.
Broad based
osteophytes as described in the mid and lower cervical region compressing the
thecal sac and abutting the cord. There
is no nerve compression. Bilateral
foraminal stenosis at C5-6 level without nerve compression. Incidental finding
possible ? chronic
thyroiditis in the thyroid gland.”
8 April 2020

14 April 2020
The Claimant’s General Practitioner referred the Claimant to Dr
Hassam for management and treatment on the basis that the Claimant,
as a result
of the accident, showed signs and symptoms of “...concussion, cervical
strain, left shoulder girdle strain, left

tendinitis, subdeltoid bursitis, upper back strain, lower back strain, right
knee and left leg injury.”
The Claimant lodged an application for Internal Review in respect of the
Insurer’s decision of 7 April 2020.
26 May 2020
Dr Hassan stated:
AQW has mild left C6 radicular sensory symptoms without clinical motor
deficits. There is no significant C6 compression in the supine
neutral position
but she may have sustained C6 nerve root injury at the time of the MVA in the
context of pre-existing C5/6 foraminal
stenosis. I suggested she continue Endep
for analgesia. She needs upper limb nerve conduction studies/EMG to look at the
of the radiculopathy and exclude concurrent carpal tunnel
16 June 2020
The Insurer approved the consultation with Dr Hassan as well as the Nerve
Conduction Studies.
22 June 2020

Dr Bassel Hassan, treating neurologist, submitted to the Insurer an invoice
for treatment on 1 July 2020, namely:
follow up consultation; and

The Insurer declined to pay statutory benefits after 26 weeks on the basis
that the Claimant was alleged to be mostly at fault for
the injury.

to pay benefits, namely not to pay the treatment account
of Dr Hassam.
16 July 2020

the Insurer not to pay the invoice of Dr Hassam.
29 July 2020
The Insurer affirmed the decision.
25 September 2020
Determination that the Claimant was not wholly at fault
Legislation
conducting my review I have considered the following legislation and
guidelines:
Accident Injuries Act
(NSW) (“the Act”)
Accident Guidelines
effective 13 July 2018 (“the
Guidelines”)
Accident Injuries Regulation
(NSW) (“the
Regulation”)
3.24(1) of the Act provides that:
(1) An injured
person is entitled to statutory
benefits for the following expenses (
"treatment and care
) incurred in connection with providing treatment
and care for the injured
(a) the reasonable cost of treatment
and care, ...
3.24(2) of the Act provides:
(2) No statutory
benefits are payable for the cost of treatment
and care to the extent that the treatment
and care concerned was not
reasonable and necessary in the
circumstances or did not relate to the injury resulting
from the motor
accident concerned.
3.28 provides:
(1) An injured
person is not entitled to statutory
benefits under this Division for treatment
and care expenses incurred more than
26 weeks after the motor
accident concerned if--
(a) the motor
accident was caused wholly or mostly by the fault of
the person and the person was over 16 years of age at the time
of the motor
accident, or
(b) the person's only injuries resulting from the motor
accident were minor injuries.
to Schedule (2)(i) of the Act, this is a Reviewable Decision as to whether the
cost of treatment and care provided to the
Claimant is reasonable for the
purposes of section 3.24(1)(a).
Submissions
briefly summarise the Respondents Submissions to this Application at R1 by
paragraph number:
[4] ... the Claimant has been found to be wholly
at fault ... is not entitled to treatment expenses incurred more than 26 weeks
the accident.
[5] The Insurer relies on the Certificate of Determination of 19 May
[10] On 16 June, the Claimant was advised that Nerve Conduction Studies had
been approved but no benefits are payable by the Insurer
after 19 June 2020.
[14] Section 3.28(1) of the Act does not give any discretion to the Insurer
or a Merit Reviewer to entitle a Claimant who is wholly
at fault to treatment
expenses more than 26 weeks after the accident.
[15] The word “incurred” should be given the ordinary and natural
meaning as referring to the past tense “treatment
expenses were only
uncured once the service actually was provided on 1 July 2020.”
[16] “Incurred” should be interpreted in the context and refers
to Guideline 4.104.
[19] The expense was incurred more than 26 weeks after the date of the
[21] Distinguishing the DRS decision of AFD v Allianz Australia Insurance
Limited [2019] NSWDRS MR 130, here there was no contractual
relation formed with
Dr Hassan to pay for the invoice of 1 July 2020. The Insurer advised Dr Hassan
on 22 May 2020 that no further
treatment expenses would be paid after 19 June
2020. The treatment for Nerve Conduction Studies was conditionally approved on
June 2020 on the basis that the service would be rendered not after 19 June
[20] There is no discretion under s 3.28(1) to pay for treatment expenses
incurred after 26 weeks, as she has been found to be wholly
Documents and Information
have considered the documents provided in the application and the reply and any
further information provided by the parties.
Consideration
do not consider there can be any real debate about the proposition that the
treatment expense, being mainly the consultation and
Nerve Conduction Study by
Dr Hassan, was not “incurred” until the date of the service, which
also happens to be the same
date as the date of the invoice.
3.28(1) of the Act is clear that there is no entitlement to treatment expenses
after 26 weeks where the Claimant is wholly
Insurer based its submissions in relation to the entitlement to payment of the
treatment expense incurred on 1 July 2020 completely
on the proposition that the
Insurer’s liability had been determined, according to section 3.28
Insurer did not submit or rely on the proposition that the Claimant was not
entitled to payment of the treatment expense of Dr
Hassan by reason of section
3.28(1)(b) [minor injuries].
refer to the Certificates of Determination dated 25 September 2020 that the
Claimant was not wholly at fault and therefore any entitlement
to decline the
payment of treatment expense pursuant to section 328(1)(a) falls away.
accept the submission of the Insurer as to the absence of any contractual
entitlement and the distinction between this factual situation
and that of the
published DRS decision of
AFD v Allianz Australia Insurance Limited
[2019] NSWDRS MR 130.
does not appear to be any formal determination that the injuries sustained by
the Claimant were Minor Injuries and it would
appear, therefore, that section
3.28(1)(b) does not apply, though I make no finding to that effect as the issue
was not raised by
the Insurer in its submissions in response or at
Legal Costs
Claimant is not entitled to legal costs, notwithstanding that it was provided
with legal assistance.
Determination
My determination of the Merit Review is as follows:
reviewable decision is set aside
and the following decision is made in
substitution for the reviewable decision:
the medical treatment provided by Dr Bassel Hassan to the Claimant on 1 July
2020, namely Item 116 – follow up consultation
at a cost of $158.00 and
Item 11018 – nerve conduction studies/EMG at a cost of $575.00, were both
reasonable and necessary
at the time of the treatment provided and at the time
of the invoice (also 1 July 2020).
This determination takes effect on 18 November 2020.
Legal costs have not been assessed as there is no entitlement to
