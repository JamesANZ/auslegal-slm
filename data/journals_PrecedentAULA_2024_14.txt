Policy catharsis: Responding to the rise in mental injury claims
By Greg Spinda
Last year, Queensland Mental Health Week (7–15 October) fell within
National Safe Work Month, when the focus was on stakeholder
collaboration for
continual improvement. It just so happened that, on 4 October, the Final Report
into the 2023 review of the Queensland
workers’ compensation
(Final Report) was released.
These key moments shone a spotlight on the latest research findings, which show
an increase in both
primary and secondary mental injury claims arising from
workplace incidents, as well as from car accidents.
It is inevitable that such trends will lead to policy and legislative
responses from regulators and government. This response cannot
be a knee-jerk
reaction. Effective policy and legislative responses must be evidence based,
carefully examining the data, understanding
the causes and analysing different
options, with a clear, overarching
This article deals with mental injury claims in the workers’
compensation scheme in Queensland, and provides some data from
the compulsory
third party (CTP) scheme. First, it sets out the difference between primary and
secondary mental injures. Second,
it looks at the data in Queensland and
presents the author’s observations over 17 years of practice. Next, this
article identifies
a clear policy intention and key indicators to measure the
effectiveness of a response to mental injury claims. Finally, this article
identifies the dominant causes and challenges that ought to be addressed as the
foundation of any policy response.
WHAT ARE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURIES?
The term ‘primary psychological injury’ is used where that injury
is the dominant (and sometimes only) injury, for example,
a major depressive
condition arising from workplace bullying or post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) arising from a car accident.
It is possible in such cases that any
physical injury is secondary or minor in comparison to the dominant
psychological condition.
A secondary psychological injury arises following a physical injury –
think of an adjustment disorder following a lumbar disc
protrusion.
One of the recommendations of the Final Report was to update the terminology
from ‘psychological or psychiatric injury’
GENERAL TRENDS
Since 2017, WorkCover Queensland has seen an increase in mental injury claim
lodgements of 27%.
In 2022, of the
92,424 statutory workers’ compensation claims lodged, about 6% (5,530)
related to mental injuries.
Tracking the exact numbers relating to CTP claims is more difficult due to
how data has been kept and reported. However, of the finalised
accidents occurring in 2021, approximately 22% had a mental injury component,
compared to approximately 15% for accidents
occurring in
The trend is clear: mental injury claims have increased over the last five
years. Mental health injuries have become, and will continue
significant focus of Queensland’s personal injury schemes. As noted,
though, any effective policy or legislative response
requires an understanding
of more than just the headline numbers.

THE DATA – CTP
While there has been a steady increase in CTP claims involving a mental
injury component, the data reveals no concomitant increase
in finalised claim
sizes as at the end of December 2022. In other words, there are more CTP claims
which include a mental injury
component, but that is not increasing the amount
for which such claims resolve.
OBSERVATIONS OVER THE YEARS
Over the years, and particularly since COVID-19, I have noticed the rise in
the number of mental injuries – both primary and
Partly this has been driven by changing cultural norms, and a greater
recognition and understanding of mental injuries as genuine,
real and just as
debilitating as any physical injury. My conversations with medical professionals
have been focused on the extent
of training they are undergoing to identify and
manage such injuries. The medical and allied health profession is spearheading
recognition, diagnosis and management of mental injuries, and was doing so
well before COVID-19. In fact, 10 years ago the Royal
Australian College of
General Practitioners was actively educating the profession about the role of
GPs in identification and early
response to mental
More recently, I heard of the concept of ‘allostatic load’ from a
psychologist. ‘Allostatic load refers to the cumulative
burden of chronic
stress and life events’, such that environmental challenges can overwhelm
a person’s ability to
COVID-19 was a global
shock to the human system, lasting a long period, with flow-on effects on family
dynamics, work, social interactions
and finances. This may have added a
tremendous and sudden load for many people, and those who then suffered an
injury may have become
overloaded and decompensated, going into allostatic load.
Understanding this may well contribute to our understanding of why, especially
since 2019, there has been a higher incidence of mental injury claims, and
particularly secondary mental injury claims.
In my practice, I am finding that clients and their families are speaking
openly about their mental health following an accident.
As a community, we
should be proud to have evolved to accept this discussion as
In the CTP space, the higher incidence of mental injuries is not leading to
claim costs increasing. This would suggest that, perhaps
with quick treatment
funded by the insurer, the impact of a mental injury (and likely mostly of
secondary mental injury) can be minimised
– which translates to no
discernible increase in claim sizes. As a plaintiff lawyer, one then really
needs to consider in such
cases the utility of spending thousands of dollars on
psychiatric medico-legal assessments.
In the workers’ compensation space, it is a somewhat more complex
picture. It seems the statutory scheme durations and costs
are higher and return
to work outcomes lower for mental injuries, although average costs per day are
substantially less for mental
injury claims. Statutory claims with a secondary
mental health component are also more likely to lead to a common law claim and
claim costs. But I would caution policymakers relying solely on the
headline data that common law claims involving secondary mental
injuries have
higher costs. The simple rationale for this could be that such claims involve
people with severe physical injuries,
which of themselves increase treatment
needs. Further, our health system is under strain, with long wait lists to see
providers (especially
psychologists and psychiatrists), which increases
durations and treatment costs. The reality is there is insufficient data
from WorkCover to truly understand the reasons.
Acknowledging that there are differences in scheme data gathering and
reporting, and different outcome measures, the differential
in scheme outcomes
is quite disparate. It is surely not just a result of early treatment funding,
because the workers’ compensation
scheme also provides early intervention
funding. The differing outcomes are not accidental though, nor do they have any
relationship
to how insurers are managing such claims. Recognition of the
importance of mental health comes with challenges when this is placed
context of insurance claims, but especially so in the workers’
compensation context. Before I move on to the challenges
and causes, it is
necessary, as a matter of effective policy setting, to identify a clear intent
for reform and the current state
of affairs in Queensland.
CLEAR INTENT AND KEY INDICATORS
No matter the insurance scheme, the clear intent of any effective policy or
legislative response has to be to improve mental health
outcomes for injured
The measure of the effectiveness of any response would be that average key
indicators for both primary and secondary mental injury
claims become more
consistent with average key indicators for physical injury claims. An important
proviso: the outcomes will never
be identical. They cannot be, because mental
injuries bring an added layer of complexity to injury management. However, a
of the gap between outcomes for mental and physical injuries, as
evidenced by the following three key indicators, would be a useful
1. Return to work outcomes.
2. Reduced claim durations.
3. Reduced claim costs.
A further key piece of data, which is presently not gathered but would be of
utility, is the number of finalised common law/damages
claims that actually rely
on psychiatric medico-legal evidence. This would indicate whether the initially
recognised mental injury
(during the statutory claim) was included in the
damages claim. As the frequency of this reduces, it would indicate that the
injury has been effectively alleviated/treated/managed.
CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS
The Final Report dedicated an entire chapter and nine recommendations to
mental injury claims. The recommendations include requiring
early direct contact
with injured workers to enable access to early intervention; screening tools for
claim advisors to identify
early intervention needs to reduce the development of
secondary mental injuries; improving decision-making processes; and better
information sharing between regulators to identify and manage high risk
workplaces.
Recently, a stakeholder forum for WorkCover Queensland examined the rise of
mental injury claims, particularly of secondary mental
injury claims. The most
critical issue identified by the forum was the need for improvements in
return-to-work processes and employer
engagement during the workers’
compensation process. Research presented at this stakeholder forum identified
the importance
of treating injured workers fairly, and communication and
collaboration from and by the employer and the insurer.
Unfortunately, Queensland employers have fared well below the national
average in employer response to injury, willingness to support
injured workers,
and treating workers fairly.
WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND CAUSES?
Having been involved with Australian Lawyers Alliance (ALA) advocacy in
Queensland for many years, including the recent WorkCover
stakeholder forum on
mental injuries, and practised in this space for the last 17 years, I can
identify some of the challenges around
and causes of the rise in mental injury
claims, which include the following:
1. Scepticism: Increased awareness and open discussion have also come with
some scepticism – suggestions that injured people
are ‘putting it
on’, increasing their claims, or lack resilience. Average claim costs are
higher than the total average,
but a large portion of this is treatment costs,
which are legitimate expenses and reflect the underlying reality of poorly
mental health services and high treatment costs.
On workers’ compensation, weekly benefits are 75%–85% of
pre-injury income (depending on duration). Injured workers struggle
financially
to continue to meet household expenses. Going on workers’ compensation is
not a luxury or a cash cow. Each day
I work with clients who are at their most
vulnerable, yet I see the desire to beat it for themselves and their families.
claim is a necessary choice most people would prefer not to make.
2. Meaningful return-to-work: Many of my clients begin exhibiting mental
injury symptoms when a return-to-work program is being developed.
seen a client with multiple trade qualifications and a good employment record
required to count nuts and bolts sitting
on a crate alone in a corner of a
warehouse, causing disengagement, physical separation from co-workers, and
rumours. This is hardly
meaningful return to work, and it is not going to
facilitate engagement. Efforts need to be made to engage the injured in work
will genuinely allow a return to their former role or, if that isn’t
possible, allows them to identify other potential career
pathways, whether at
that employer or elsewhere.
3. Genuine employer engagement in return to work: Strain in relationships can
occur when an employer doesn’t sensibly and genuinely
engage with
WorkCover, an occupational therapist and the injured worker in the
return-to-work program. This can look like breaching
the suitable duties
program, directing the worker to do something different to the agreed program,
isolating the worker, turning
a blind eye to co-workers who fail to assist in
the process, or fundamentally seeing the worker as an enemy for making a claim
refusing to offer alternative duties. Some of this behaviour could arise
from fear – of the unknown, dealing with WorkCover
and an insurance
process, of reinjuring the worker, of misunderstanding of the process and so on.
Some is just bad behaviour.
4. Communication with an injured person: An overwhelming majority of my
clients say that the employer did not check in with them after
they were injured
or a WorkCover claim was lodged. Those clients who do tell me about their
supervisor or the boss reaching out are
always pleased and work hard to get back
to their former job. There’s no magic to this type of conversation, but it
long way to offer a ‘how’s it going? I hope your recovery
goes well and we see you back soon. Do you want us to keep
you updated if there
are any changes at work?’
The flip side is communication that is bullying, intimidating or suggestive.
For example, making comments that the injury may have
been pre-existing or
happened on the weekend. Such matters are for WorkCover to resolve, and if the
employer has evidence that should
be given to WorkCover. Communication from an
employer doesn’t have to be complicated and the employer should take
from the injured worker as to the extent of it. It can be a simple
phone call to check in with the injured worker, ask how often
they want to be
to functions etc. This will result
in far better engagement than silence or
defensive communication.
5. Early intervention: This means an insurer both identifies when mental
health deterioration may be occurring and agrees quickly
to fund counselling. I
see most insurers doing well on funding psychological services until the need is
more entrenched (and costing
more), when many insurers will prevaricate or seek
independent medico-legal opinions (interestingly at a cost usually in excess of
what the funding request was). What no insurer does well is identify when mental
health deteriorates. I was pleased to see in the
Final Report recommendations
around WorkCover designing an assessment tool and training of claims advisors in
its application. The
consideration of mental health doesn’t just have to
occur at the start, but should be continual, because most often secondary
injury arises after the initial physical injury.
6. Our healthcare system: When it takes months to get a booking with a
psychologist or psychiatrist (and often one to three weeks
with a GP), we have a
real systemic community-wide issue. This needs government intervention,
including in our education system and
in health system funding.
Mental injury claims are increasing; however, the reason for their rise needs
to be carefully examined before policymakers make any
fundamental scheme
changes. Policy or legislative change otherwise is likely to come with
unintended consequences.
Not all claims with a psychological component result in higher claim costs or
longer claim durations. In Queensland there has been
a concerted effort to
properly understand and respond to mental injury claims. Following the Final
Report, already the Office of
Industrial Relations and WorkCover Queensland have
engaged in multiple forums. The overwhelming outcome of this engagement has been
to identify some primary root challenges – employer attitudes and poor
So, it seems we have some improvements to make – especially in our
workers’ compensation scheme – to reduce the
incidence of mental
health injuries. My hope is that the policy response to address the fundamental
underlying challenges is actually
implemented with all stakeholders
collaborating and engaging meaningfully. If we cannot do this, the impact will
be on real people,
families, workplaces and our society. We owe it to each other
to act collaboratively.
