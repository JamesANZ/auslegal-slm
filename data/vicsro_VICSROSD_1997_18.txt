Dutiability of Hire Purchase Deposits and Final Payments (SD-089) [1997] VICSROSD 18 (1 November 1997)
Revenue Rulings
An amendment to the
Stamps Act 1958
provides that income from hire purchase agreements
entered into on or after 1 January 1997 will be liable
for rental business duty in certain circumstances.
Rental business duty is payable where a business
received more than $6,000.00 in rental payments
(including hire purchase payments) in a given
month. In these cases, a business is required to
register and pay duty at the rate of 0.75 per cent on
receipts over the $6,000.00 threshold. The Act
specifies that receipts in respect of a rental business
for or in relation to the use of goods are liable to
duty. (See sections 131AC, and 131AA).
The purposes of this Ruling is to clarify whether
deposits and final payments made under a hire
purchase agreement are subject to rental
business duty.
The dutiability of any payment received under a hire
purchase agreement is dependent on if the payment
can be characterised as a payment for the use
Final payments under a hire purchase agreement
are not liable for duty, where the payment triggers
the passing of title in the property. These payments
are for the sale of goods rather than rental payments
for the use of goods.
Deposits made under a hire purchase agreement
may be dutiable depending on who receives the
payment. Deposits which are received by the
financier hiring the goods are subject to duty.
However, where the deposit is received by a third
party, such as the manufacturer or dealer, and is not
paid at the direction of the financier to satisfy an
obligation in respect of rental payable to the
financier, such a deposit is not dutiable.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
