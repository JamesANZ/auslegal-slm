Now To Regulate Internet Gaming - A Gamble In Itself?
University Solicitor, RMIT University, Melbourne
Introduction
the legislation succeed?
Shortcomings
in the legislation
should the role of government be in Internet regulation?
Introduction
Enthusiasm for
on-line gaming appears to be gaining significant momentum in Australia,
and it is estimated that last year 86,000 Australians
used the Internet
to bet on sports and casino games
This is hardly surprising given that gambling, and now Internet use,
are firmly ingrained in Australian popular culture. It also
comes as no
surprise that Australian legislatures have rushed headlong into
regulating Internet gaming activity.
exception of New South Wales and Western Australia, the remaining
Australian states have passed or have indicated an intention
legislation to regulate on-line gaming. The Northern Territory has also
enacted such legislation. For the purposes of this
comment, I propose
to make comparisons between the Queensland
Interactive
Gambling (Player Protection) Act
and the Victorian
Interactive
Gaming (Player Protection) Act
Will the legislation succeed?
Whether or not
the legislation will succeed depends upon the purpose of the
legislation. If the purpose of the legislation is to regulate
gaming activity in Australia, then it will be a dismal failure.
Unfortunately, many politicians and lawyers have still not
grips with the fact that it is impossible to effectively regulate
Internet activity through legislation.
If, on the other hand, the purpose of the legislation is to facilitate
Internet gaming and to give players a greater opportunity
on-line with a solvent body and with a reasonable likelihood that any
winnings will be paid, then I suggest that the legislation
prospects of success.
Legislation
which attempts to regulate Internet activity must recognise the
relating to jurisdiction and the Internet have been extensively and
well argued elsewhere
and it is the writer's opinion that for a government to effectively
regulate any activity, the following are necessary criteria:
government must have jurisdiction to regulate the activity.
of a government depends upon its recognition by other
governments. Therefore, attempts to assert jurisdiction need to be
A government will only have jurisdiction over persons and
things which have some nexus or relationship with the relevant state or
country administered by that government. Thus, for example, the
Victorian state government would not be recognised by other governments
as having jurisdiction to legislate with respect to kiwi breeding in
New Zealand.
The government must also be in a
position to exercise power over or control breaches of the activity
which the government seeks to
regulate. Law-making requires some
mechanism for law-enforcement which in turn depends on the ability to
exercise physical control
over law violators.
Attempts to
create effective regulation of the Internet fail on both counts. The
Internet is so geography-averse that in any instance
impossible to determine an Internet user's physical location or the
location in which Internet activity occurred.
For example, I may register an address in the <.com.au>
domain, but I do not need to have my operations based in Australia
enable me to do so. Furthermore, there is nothing to stop me
transferring my host computer and my Internet address (or either
them) to any other location in the world. Persons dealing with me would
have no idea that such transfers had taken place.
Just as it is
impossible to confidently assert where an Internet operator is located,
it is impossible to confidently assert where
Internet activity has
taken place at any given time. This is because of the protocols which
determine the way the Internet works
and the Internet's functionality,
packet-switching, whereby
information is broken up into packets which can be routed through any
number of nodes around the world until
they reach the recipient;
use of 'caching' copies of frequently accessed material to avoid
continual reference back to the originating server;
the case of the world wide web, the use of hyperlinking, in-lining
links and framing by an Internet host such that the user may
able to determine the source of origin of the original material.
geography-averse nature of the Internet makes Internet activity
impossible to effectively regulate. Internet activity can be anywhere
and almost everywhere!
governments will lose credibility if they unrealistically attempt to
Internet activity, there is considerable merit in
governments enacting legislation to
Internet transactions. In the writer's opinion, both the Queensland and
the Victorian legislation attempt to both facilitate and
Internet gaming. The Queensland legislation attempts to regulate more
so than the Victorian legislation.
Shortcomings
in the legislation
There are a
number of provisions in the legislation which lack credibility in that
they create jurisdictional uncertainty. Sections
7(1) and (2) of the
Victorian Act and sections 8(1) and (2) of the Queensland Act in
essence provide that the legislation applies
both within and outside
the state and 'to the full extent of the extraterritorial legislative
power of the Parliament'. This seems
to be an acknowledgment by the
states that they will push the limits of their jurisdiction as far as
they can in order to regulate
Internet gaming. State and federal
legislatures must exercise extreme caution when attempting to regulate
activity beyond their boundaries,
as such attempts can raise grave
questions regarding sovereignty and jurisdiction.
Section 16(1)
of the Queensland Act provides that a person must not conduct an
interactive game wholly or partly in Queensland or
allow another person
to do so unless the game is authorised and the person is authorised
under the Act to conduct the game. What
exactly does this mean? If I
was legitimately conducting an on-line gaming business in the
Netherlands Antilles and my web page and
service were accessed by a
Queensland resident, I would no doubt be considered to be at least
'partly' carrying on an interactive
game in Queensland. Would I be
arrested if I subsequently happened to set foot in Queensland? The
scenario is not as unlikely as
may first appear. In April this year an
Adelaide-based holocaust revisionist, Dr Frederick Toben, was arrested
in Mannheim, Germany
over material posted on his Adelaide Institute
Because the material was accessed in Germany, it was treated as a
German publication and one that breached German laws prohibiting
of the holocaust.
The Victorian
Act renders such a scenario equally likely through its prohibition on
advertising of interactive games by unlicensed
providers. Section
9(1)(c) provides that a person must not offer or advertise in Victoria
the playing of interactive games. The web
page of the provider who
operates an Internet gaming business substantially outside Victoria
would certainly contain such an 'offer'
or 'advertisement' and would be
readily accessible in Victoria. (Technically, the provider could
endeavour to deny access to Victorians
by programming its server to
refuse requests originating at the <.au> domain, but of
course there will be Victorians with Internet
addresses which are not
in the <.au> domain). A similar prohibition exists in
Queensland under section 164 of the Queensland
Section 17(2)
of the Queensland Act prohibits a person from participating as a player
in an authorised game unless that person is
registered with the
authorised provider. If I, as a Victorian, failed to register as a
player and participated in an authorised Queensland
interactive game,
would I risk extradition or risk arrest when I next set foot in
Queensland? At least the Victorian Act recognises
the absurdity of
imposing sanctions upon players, whether resident in Victoria or
otherwise, and contains no corresponding provision.
should the role of government be in Internet regulation?
Internet activity is difficult to effectively regulate, attempts at
regulation can result in serious and often unintended consequences.
the case of Internet gaming, the writer has no doubt that the
governments of Queensland and Victoria are well-intentioned in imposing
certain prohibitions in respect of Internet gaming activity. But those
governments have failed to recognise the consequences of purporting
regulate the activities of persons located outside their geographical
borders. (Of course, it is not only legislation specifically
regulate Internet activity which can create jurisdictional uncertainty.
Such problems can arise where any regulated activity
takes place in an
on-line environment).
legal opinion advocates a system of self regulation in respect of
Internet activity rather than attempting to overcome jurisdictional
problems through the establishment of international laws.
However, in view of the problems which arise when a government purports
to regulate the activities of persons located beyond the
geographical
borders of that government, some attempt needs to be made to reach an
international consensus on the extent to which
governments can do so.
This will be no easy task given the glacial speed of the international
treaty process,
but it is a task which must be undertaken as the Internet will be with
us forever in one form or another. The urgency of this task
will become
more acute if, as seems likely, governments of other Australian states
and of other countries continue to attempt regulation
