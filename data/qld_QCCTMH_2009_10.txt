REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application in a proceeding by park owners Dunluce Properties Pty Ltd as
Trustee and Daleside Pty Ltd as Trustee trading
as “Beaudesert Gardens
Estate” (“the respondents”) for legal representation. Annette
Trout and others (the
applicants) are home owners at the manufactured home park
named Beadesert Garden Estate located at Beaudesert (“the park”).
the original application the applicants allege that the internal roads at the
park are in a deplorable state and seek an order
that the respondents renovate
and/or repair these roads as soon as possible. The respondents in their defence
allege that the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine this
application. The issue of jurisdiction is being determined by the Tribunal as a
preliminary
issue and the respondents seek an order for legal representation at
this hearing. The respondents sought the applicants’ consent
representation but this consent was not forthcoming.
the applicants and the respondents have filed lengthy and considered submissions
on the issue of jurisdiction.
Relevant legislation
relevant provisions of the
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(“CCT Act”) with respect to legal representation are:
73 Purposes of div 8
The main purpose of this division is to have parties represent themselves
and save legal costs unless the interests of justice require
76 Who represents party at other proceedings
(2) A party may be represented by a lawyer if—
tribunal directs that representation by the lawyer is appropriate having regard
to all the circumstances including, for example—
(i) the cost
of representation and whether each party can afford to be represented;
complexity of the legal and factual issues involved; and
potential for lengthening the proceeding if a party is not represented;
ability of the lawyer or other person to help the tribunal and the party
represented; and
ability of the party to represent himself or herself.”
Applicants’ submissions
applicants refuse to give their consent for the respondents to be legally
represented at the hearing. They assert that the applicants
are lay persons and
would be disadvantaged if a lawyer was to represent the respondents.
Respondents’ submissions
respondents have filed detailed submissions with respect to the issue of legal
representation and with respect to the issue of
respondents assert that the jurisdiction issue involves complex legal arguments
and it would be of assistance
to the Tribunal to have a lawyer present their
Observations and Finding
considering this issue of legal representation it is necessary to canvas each of
the factors listed in section 76(2)(e) of the
CCT Act. The first issue involves
a consideration of the cost of representation and whether each party can afford
to be represented.
This is an application by the respondents who are able to
afford legal representation and they have indicated that they will not
seeking a costs order against the applicants if they were successful in their
The second issue requires a consideration of the complexity of the legal and
factual issues involved. The jurisdiction argument
involves a consideration of
the meaning of the express words contained in the provisions of the
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003
(“MHRP Act”),
especially section 140. The arguments that can be raised are complex and
detailed. There are a number of
recent decisions of the Tribunal where the issue
of jurisdiction has been considered, these are:
Australiana Village Residents
Committee and Ors v Australiana Caravan Park Pty Ltd
[2007] CCT MH020-06:
Veal v The Mostar Trust t/a Kenmont Investments Pty Ltd & Dalma
Plastering Pty Ltd
[2007] CCT MH026-06:
Robinson v Walter Elliot Holdings
Ltd [2007] CCT MH006-07
next issue is the potential to lengthen the proceeding if a party is not
represented. This is a one issue matter and the submissions
should not be
lengthy. I am not satisfied that the engagement of a lawyer would lengthen or
shorten the proceedings. Further, the
issue of the ability of a lawyer
and/or the ability of the party to represent himself or herself is not an issue
in this matter.
am satisfied that it is in the interest of justice that the respondents be
represented by a lawyer. This is a complex legal case
that involves a
construction of the relevant provisions of the MHRP Act. I am satisfied that it
is appropriate for the respondents
to be represented by a lawyer in the
respondents are permitted to be represented by a lawyer in the jurisdiction
application.
