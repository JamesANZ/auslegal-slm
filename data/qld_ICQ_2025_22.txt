In the absence of the filing and service of any notice of intention to make oral
submissions on costs, costs will be determined
on any written submissions
without further oral hearing.”
[2] Written
submissions were exchanged pursuant to the orders made on 17 September 2025. No
party filed a notice of intention to
make oral submissions as to costs and,
therefore, the question of costs is to be dealt with on the written submissions.
This is the
determination of the costs issued.
[3] Mr Romanski
holds a certificate of competency under the
Coal Mining Safety and
(CMSHA) as an underground mine manager and as a Site Senior Executive.
Mr Stone is the Chief Executive Officer, Resources, Safety
Queensland.
[4] Mr Stone
took disciplinary action against Mr Romanski pursuant to provisions of the
CMSHA. Those provisions prescribe a procedure
whereby Mr Stone was to give a
“proposed action notice” within which he alleged the facts upon
which he could justify
taking disciplinary action. By the provisions, Mr
Romanski would then answer the allegations in writing and, by yet another
Mr Stone would decide whether the alleged conduct was found proven
(the show cause procedure). Mr Stone found most of the allegations
substantiated, which then enlivened a power to impose a disciplinary
[5] Mr Romanski
appealed to the Industrial Magistrates Court against the finding that
disciplinary grounds were substantiated. The
Industrial Magistrate made
directions for the exchange of statements of contention. A statement of
contentions was filed by Mr Stone.
Mr Romanski sought to strike out aspects of
Mr Stone’s statement of contentions on the basis that issues were raised
Stone in the statement beyond those defined by the show cause procedure.
[6] The learned
Industrial Magistrate, to whom the strike out application was made, dismissed
that application. His Honour took the
view that as the nature of the appeal to
him was a hearing
, the appeal was not limited to the allegations
made in the show cause procedure.
[7] Mr Romanski
appealed the refusal of the Industrial Magistrate to strike out the offending
parts of Mr Stone’s statement
of contentions. By notice of appeal filed
14 February 2024, an appeal was brought to this Court from the interlocutory
the Industrial Magistrate.
September 2025, Deputy President Hartigan held that:
(a) no appeal lay from an interlocutory decision of the Industrial Magistrate;
(b) in any event, any avenue of appeal was to the District Court not to this
(c) prerogative relief may be available to Mr Romanski in the original
to grant such
[9] The Deputy
President dismissed the application to strike out the appeal to facilitate the
bringing of the foreshadowed application
for prerogative
The Deputy President did
not deal with the costs of the appeal.
[10] On 22 April
2025, Mr Romanski filed an application seeking prerogative relief. The case to
be mounted was that the Industrial
Magistrate could only rehear
the matter which was before Mr Stone. The matter for decision before Mr Stone
was defined by the show cause procedure limiting his
consideration to the
allegations and answers exchanged in that procedure. By not striking out
allegations in the statement of contentions
which went beyond the original
allegations in the notice of proposed action, the Industrial Magistrate was
acting beyond jurisdiction.
application for prerogative relief was made beyond the time limit for the
bringing of such applications, but Mr Stone did
not oppose an application for an
extension of time.
[12] Time was
extended and the application for prerogative relief was
successful.
[13] As earlier
observed, directions were made for the exchange of submissions on
Consideration
Section 545
Industrial Relations Act 2016
governs applications for costs of
proceedings before this Court:
545 General power to award
(1) A person must bear the person’s own costs in relation to a
proceeding before the court or commission.
(2) However, the court or commission may, on application by a party to the
proceeding, order—
(a) a party to the proceeding to pay costs incurred by another party if the
court or commission is satisfied—
(i) the party made the application or responded to the application vexatiously
or without reasonable cause; or
(ii) it would have been reasonably apparent to the party that the application
or response to the application had no reasonable prospect
of success...”
[15] The power
to award costs only arises in the circumstances identified by, relevantly here,
s 545(2)(a).
Mr Romanski submits
that, as the primary judgment shows, a comparison between the statement of
contentions of Mr Stone and the statement
of proposed action demonstrates that
the allegations in the statement of contentions exceeded the scope of the
allegations in the
notice of proposed action. Therefore, it is submitted that
the defence of the application was taken either without reasonable
or in circumstances that it
was reasonably apparent to Mr Stone that his defence to the application had no
reasonable prospects of
[16] Mr Romanski
submits that if the jurisdiction to award costs in his favour has arisen then
the discretion should be exercised
in his favour as:
(a) on the uncontested facts, it was clear that Mr Romanski’s application
would be successful;
(b) ultimately, there was no legal argument advanced by Mr Stone against Mr
Romanski’s submissions as to the scope of jurisdiction
of the Industrial
Magistrate, so the matter was purely a factual one;
(c) it was reasonable and necessary for Mr Romanski to bring the application for
prerogative relief;
(d) it would be unjust for Mr Romanski to bear the costs;
(e) Mr Romanski was not at fault in bringing his challenge by way of appeal
initially because there were no cases where courts had
considered the scope of
the relevant provisions; and
(f) bringing the appeal was reasonable.
[17] Mr Stone
(a) he was effectively successful before Deputy President Hartigan who found
that the appeal was incompetent;
(b) he acted sensibly by not defending the application for an extension of time;
(c) there were no cases where the courts had considered the limits of the
an appeal from a
decision taken under the CMSHA after service of a proposed action notice, so the
matter was novel.
[18] Mr Romanski
seeks his costs and Mr Stone seeks no order as to costs.
[19] It could
not be said that Mr Stone’s response to the appeal was either taken
without reasonable cause or that his defence
of the appeal had no reasonable
prospects of success. He effectively won the appeal by establishing that it was
incompetent for
two reasons, namely:
(a) no appeal lay from an interlocutory decision of the Industrial Magistrates
(b) any appeal from an appealable decision of the Industrial Magistrate would
lie to the District Court not this Court.
[20] Even though
Mr Stone was successful in his arguments before Deputy President Hartigan, the
Deputy President took the pragmatic
view that the proceedings ought to be kept
on foot while an application for prerogative relief was filed. It was the
application for prerogative relief which was successful.
[21] Mr Romanski
accepts that Mr Stone was victorious in his challenge to the appeal and,
therefore, only seeks costs in respect of
the application for prerogative
[22] It is, in
my view, unnecessary to determine whether the discretion to award costs in
favour of Mr Romanski in relation to the
prerogative relief application arises.
If it did, I would not make an order for costs in Mr Romanski’s
[23] I regard
the following considerations as determinative:
(a) the starting point is that each party bear their own costs. That is the
philosophy of the IR Act;
(b) the appeal was incompetent;
(c) significant costs were no doubt incurred by Mr Stone in defending the
(d) Mr Romanski pressed the appeal, even in the face of a strike out application
brought by Mr Stone;
(e) as explained, Mr Stone was, in practical terms, successful in the strike out
application;
(f) no doubt significant costs were incurred by Mr Stone in bringing the
application to strike out an incompetent appeal; and
(g) the relevant provisions of the CMSHA had not previously been tested. While
ultimately it was conceded that the Industrial Magistrates
limited by the show cause procedure, there was still sensible argument as to
how, on the facts, that limited the
scope of the current appeal to the
Industrial Magistrates Court.
[24] For those
reasons, each party should bear their own costs and there should therefore be no
order as to costs.
be no order as to costs of the appeal; and
be no order as to costs of the application for prerogative relief.
