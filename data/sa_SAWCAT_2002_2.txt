REPRESENTATION:
Appellant: In Person
Respondent: Mr M Crawley
Solicitors:
Applicant: N/A
Respondent: Piper Alderman
1 On 21 March 1994 a Review Officer made certain orders in respect of an
application for review lodged by the appellant, Rodney
Synnett ("the worker")
relating to various claims that he had made for compensation pursuant to
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act
2 For present purposes it is not necessary for me to set out the full text of
the Review Officer's orders. It is sufficient to record
that the transcript of
the order contains the heading "Discussion" and immediately following is a
statement by the Review Officer
in the following terms:-
"I will also note that no supplementary payment is payable and that is because
the aggregate of compensation payable is a mixture
of two claims that arose on
different dates. They were not the same disabilities arising out of the same
situation - different circumstances
- the back happened in an incident, the
stress was obviously a protracted thing. On my understanding of
it wouldn't attract the 43(6) or (7) supplementary payment."
3 It has since been decided by the Full Bench of the Workers Compensation
Tribunal in
Cedic v WorkCover/MMI (Modular Furniture Pty Ltd)
[2000] SAWCT 54
that the supplementary benefit prescribed by
apply to permanent disabilities arising out of different compensable
disabilities.
4 Although it might be arguable that the principle of
stare decisis
the doctrine of precedent might not strictly require members of the Workers
Compensation Appeal Tribunal to follow decisions of
the Full Bench of the
Workers Compensation Tribunal, it is fair to say, that as the very least, a
single member of the Workers Compensation
Appeal Tribunal might find such a
decision highly persuasive and to that end, an appeal against this aspect of
the Review Officer's
decision, if lodged within time, would have a fair
prospect of success.
5 The worker now wishes to pursue a claim for the supplementary benefit
prescribed by his
6 The Corporation contends for a variety of reasons that such benefit is not
payable. One of the reasons that it advances is that
the decision of the Review
Officer, to which I have referred, has dealt with this and has determined that
the worker has no such
entitlement.
7 The worker contends that this issue was never before the Review Officer such
that his purported decision in respect thereof is
8 If that is not so, then, as presently advised, he seeks an extension of time
within which to appeal the Review Officer's decision.
9 In that context both parties have requested me to rule on a preliminary
point, namely, whether or not the Review Officer made
a lawful order
determining that the worker had a nil entitlement to the supplementary benefit
prescribed by
10 In contending that the issue of a supplementary benefit was not before the
Review Officer the worker relies upon the fact that
there was no specific
reference to supplementary benefits in any of the various claim forms that he
had made in support of his application
to benefits pursuant to
11 The worker then argued that the decision of the Supreme Court in
Wiechmann v Lovering and WorkCover Corporation
(1992) 59 SASR 203
it clear that the Review Officer's dealing with
was beyond the scope
of his review and therefore should be disregarded.
12 In my view, this submission belies the robust approach expected of Review
Officers as reflected in the wide powers that were
conferred upon them pursuant
as it then was.
13 In determining what issues the Review Officer had jurisdiction to determine,
I think, with respect, that the inquiry suggested
by the Workers Compensation
Appeal Tribunal (Presiding Member Judge Parsons DP) in
Corporation (Johns Landscaping)
[1992] SAWCT89 at p 4 is entirely
appropriate. There it was said:
"...The question of what was at issue between the parties is ascertained by a
consideration of the application for review and the
conduct of the parties on
14 Although the claim forms may have made no mention of
other evidence indicating that the parties' representatives appreciated its
potential involvement in the assessment. A
telephone note recording a message
from the worker's then solicitor, Mr Radbone, to the Corporation's then
solicitor, Mr O'Callaghan,
of the 18 March 1994 states as follows:-
"re SYNNETT - `telephone' offer of $58,380 is rejected. They calculate that 70%
of the prescribed amount, with a supplementary benefit,
amounts to $77,145.00.
Their client is prepared to settle his
entitlements for
$98,000.00."
15 Moreover, although I do not have the benefit of the transcription of the
discussion that took place between the parties in the
presence of the Review
Officer, immediately preceding the Review Officer's consideration of the issue
of the supplementary payment
the irresistible inference is that that issue was
discussed and that the Review Officer was asked to deal with it.
16 It seems to me, therefore, that whether or not there had ever been a formal
claim for a benefit pursuant to
is not particularly to the
17 In my opinion, the worker's reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court
Wiechmann v Lovering
(supra) to the circumstances of this case is
18 The comments made by the Court there, to the effect that a Review Officer's
the decision sought to be
impugned, has to be read in context.
19 In that case, the worker had sought a review of a determination made by the
Corporation to reduce the worker's weekly payments
of income maintenance on the
basis that he had a reasonable prospect of obtaining particular work. Although
not asked by either party
to do so, the Review Officer made a fresh
determination to the effect that the worker was no longer incapacitated for
work at all
by the compensable disability.
20 The Supreme Court was rightly concerned with the potential denial of natural
justice. It rejected the notion that a Review Officer
has the right to conduct
a general review of all potential issues of dispute between the worker and the
Corporation.
21 But as the decision of
Cristea v The Workers Rehabilitation and
Compensation Corporation (CCA Snack Foods)
[1993] SASC 4356
(1993) 61 SASR 487
demonstrates,
it does not follow that the Review Officer is strictly limited to a
consideration of only the material contained within
the claim form and the
determination upon which the application for review was made. As King CJ
observed at 489:
"The jurisdiction of the Review Officer therefore extends to the making of any
determination which can fairly be said to be within
the scope of the matters to
which the Corporation's decision relates."
22 In the circumstances of this case, in my opinion, that included a
determination as to whether the worker was entitled to a supplementary
pursuant to
23 Having made this preliminary ruling I would now like to hear from the
parties as to the further conduct of this matter.
In accordance with the requirements of s 93 of the
Workers Rehabilitation and
Compensation Act, 1986
(as it was immediately prior to 5 June 1996) the parties
are notified that if a party wishes to apply to the Full Supreme Court for
leave to appeal against any part of this decision which raises a question of
law, such appeal must be instituted within one month
after a party who is
entitled to appeal receives notice of this decision.
NOTE CAREFULLY:
Parties are respectfully requested to note the provisions of the Supreme Court
Rules which require that in the event of an appeal
a copy of the notice of
appeal filed in the supreme Court is to be served upon "the proper officer of
the court or Tribunal below".
