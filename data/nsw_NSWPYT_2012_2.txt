COMPLAINT TWO
Has been guilty of professional misconduct within the meaning of section
139E of the National Law in that he has:
(i) Engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct of a sufficiently serious
nature to justify suspension or cancellation of his
registration; and/or
(ii) Has engaged in more than one instance of unsatisfactory professional
conduct that, when the instances are considered together,
amount to conduct of a
sufficiently serious nature to justify suspension or cancellation of his
registration.
PARTICULARS OF COMPLAINT TWO
As for Complaint One
Legislative provisions
8. Unsatisfactory professional
conduct is defined in S139 B of the National Law to include:
(a) Conduct
significantly below reasonable standard
Conduct that demonstrates the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed or
the care exercised by the practitioner in the practice of
practitioner’s profession is significantly below the standard reasonably
expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level
of training of
experience.
(l) Other Improper or Unethical Conduct
Any other improper or unethical conduct relating to the practice or
purported practice of the practitioner’s profession.
9. Professional Misconduct is defined in S139 E of the National Law as:
(a) Unsatisfactory professional conduct of a sufficiently serious nature
to justify suspension or cancellation of the practitioner’s
registration;
(b) More than one instance of unsatisfactory professional conduct that,
when the instances are considered together, amount to conduct
of a sufficiently
serious nature to justify suspension or cancellation of the practitioner’s
registration
the Complaint to be proven, the Tribunal must be comfortably satisfied that Mr
Ha committed the conduct complained of and that
his conduct satisfies the
statutory definitions of unsatisfactory professional conduct and/or professional
misconduct.
11. Accordingly, the issues for the Tribunal are:
(1) is the Tribunal comfortably satisfied that each of the Particulars of the
Complaint are proven; and
(2) if so, does Mr Ha’s conduct amounts to unsatisfactory professional
conduct and/or professional misconduct. The Tribunal
can look at all the conduct
found proven either separately or cumulatively when making a determination as to
whether the conduct
amounts to unsatisfactory professional conduct and/or
professional misconduct (see
Duncan v Medical Disciplinary Committee
[1986]1 NZLR 513).
(3) if such findings are made the Tribunal must decide whether orders or
directions in accordance with National Law are appropriate.
This aspect of the
Tribunal’s deliberations will be undertaken after further submissions have
been received from the parties.
Standard of proof
HCCC bears the onus of establishing that Mr Ha has departed to the requisite
degree from the appropriate standards and so has
been guilty of unsatisfactory
professional conduct and /or professional misconduct.
The standard of proof required to establish the Complaints is the civil
standard so the Tribunal must be reasonably satisfied on
the balance of
probabilities that Mr Ha engaged in the conduct complained of and that such
conduct constitutes unsatisfactory professional
conduct and/or professional
misconduct. Given the seriousness of the allegations and the gravity of their
consequences, the Tribunal
needs to be comfortably satisfied that the Complaints
have been established.
[1938] HCA 34
(1938) 60 CLR 336
, Dixon J (as he then was) said
at 362–363:
"Reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind
that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of
fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the
inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description,
or the gravity of
the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must
affect the answer to the question
whether the Issue has been proved to the
reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters ’reasonable
satisfaction’
should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite
testimony, or indirect inferences............This does not mean that some
of persuasion is fixed intermediate between the satisfaction beyond
reasonable doubt required upon a criminal inquest and the reasonable
satisfaction which in a civil issue may, not must, be based on a preponderance
of probability. It means that the nature of the issue
necessarily affects the
process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained”.
standard of proof is proportionate to the gravity of the issue to be proved.
These disciplinary proceedings may have significant
professional and personal
consequences for Mr Ha and the Tribunal has taken account of this in its
deliberations.
Nature of the jurisdiction
Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association
(1992)176 CLR 239 at 250-251 and
New South Wales Bar Association
(1960)104 CLR 186 at 201-202. In
[1993] NSWCA 233
in relation to the medical profession, Kirby P and
O’Keefe AJA said:
Necessarily, the exercise of a disciplinary power in respect of
a professional person may have a consequence that seems punitive and
results for the person that are burdensome and hard. But that is not their
purpose in the eye the law............. Punishment
is not the purpose of the
proceedings. That purpose remains, from first to last, ........ the protection
of the public who deal with
medical practitioners upon the assumption of their
integrity and ethical behaviour.
Tribunal not only has to protect the public but it is in the community interest
that the profession of physiotherapy should retain,
and be entitled to retain,
the respect and high regard in which it is held.
Preliminary matters
the commencement of the proceedings, the HCCC raised the question of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. S165A of the National
Law requires the
Chairperson of the Physiotherapy Tribunal to nominate the person who shall sit
as Chairperson for the purpose of
conducting an Inquiry. After conducting two
Directions Hearings but prior to the commencement of the substantive hearing on
2012, the first Chairperson so nominated indicated that she was unable
to continue and a new Chairperson was nominated. The HCCC
queried the effect of
S165C in these circumstances, specifically whether S165C (2) effected the
termination of the Inquiry and the
need for the Council to reconstitute the
National Law is silent on when an Inquiry commences. The Tribunal considers that
S165C (2) is designed to address a situation
where procedural fairness
necessitates the Tribunal being reconstituted and the matter considered de novo.
It contemplates a situation
where an Inquiry has commenced and evidence has been
heard and accordingly a change of Chairperson would be unfair. In the present
circumstances the new Chairperson was nominated before the substantive
proceedings commenced. Neither party is disadvantaged by the
Complaints being
considered by the Tribunal as presently constituted. Indeed the respondent made
no submissions in relation to this
Tribunal is satisfied that it is properly constituted and has jurisdiction to
hear the Complaints.
Leave to amend Particulars
HCCC sought leave to amend the Complaints. Mr Ha raised no objections to this
request and leave was granted. Several of the Particulars
and sub Particulars
were deleted.
HCCC tendered documents, tabbed 1 – 47, (Exhibit A) the index to which is
contained in Appendix A to this decision. The
Respondent also tendered
documents, (Exhibit B) the index to which is contained in Appendix B to this
During the hearing the HCCC tendered additional material from Mr
Daryl Bull (Exhibit C) and Ms Tracey Powell (Exhibit D). Counsel
objected to the admission of Ms Powell’s additional report on the basis
that it contained new material. The Tribunal
noted that Mr Ha is able to cross
examine Ms Powell and may seek leave to file additional evidence during the
proceedings if any
new issues arise from Ms Powell’s report.
Other material was tendered during the course of the hearing (Exhibits E
– I) and is listed in Appendix C to this decision.
Order for Substituted Service
HCCC sought and was granted an order for substituted service of a summons on Mr
Scott Casey. The Tribunal ordered that substituted
service could be effected by
way of email.
Interpreter
for Mr Ha indicated, in response to a question from the Tribunal, that Mr Ha did
not require the services of an interpreter
during the Inquiry.
Non publication order
Tribunal made a non-publication order as regards the names of the various
patients referred to in the Complaints and to any other
patients in relation to
whom evidence is adduced in the course of the proceeding. The patients involved
are identified in a Schedule
to the Complaints, which is reproduced in Appendix
D to this decision. The Tribunal directed pursuant to Clause 7 of Schedule 5D
the National Law, that the patients’ names not be published.
“Two Stage” hearing
the HCCC and Mr Ha indicated a preference for a two-stage hearing, citing the
decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal
King v Health Care
Complaints Commission
[2011] NSWCA 353.
The Tribunal directed its Inquiry be
conducted in two distinct stages—the first, to receive evidence and
submissions concerning
the Complaints and the Particulars, followed by the
Tribunal’s decision concerning those issues; and the second, if it becomes
necessary, to hear evidence and submissions addressing any consequential orders.
Tribunal was satisfied in the particular circumstances of this case, as there
are 2 Complaints each of which has 61 Particulars,
that this approach accorded
fairness to the parties by allowing them appropriate time and opportunity to
make submissions as to suitable
orders, after having considered the
Tribunal’s findings on the multiple Particulars.
28. The following people gave evidence to the
Quang Ha, the Respondent
Daryl Bull, former Manager of Claims and Provider Relations, nib Health
Tracey Powell, a registered physiotherapist who gave expert evidence for the
Kindness, a registered physiotherapist who undertook an audit of the
Respondent’s practice on behalf of nib, in her role
as a Consultant
Physiotherapist Advisor.
Scott Casey, former Investigator, nib Health Fund.
The Practitioner
Trac Quang Ha is registered to practice physiotherapy in NSW having studied
physiotherapy at Sydney University (Cumberland Campus)
between 1993 and 1996. He
has worked at the Blue Mountains Hospital, Katoomba (1997- 1998) and at a number
of private physiotherapy
clinics. In 2001 he began working at Fairfield Heights
Physiotherapy and became the proprietor of that clinic in 2004. He is a member
of the Australian Physiotherapy Association (APA) and Physiotherapy Business
Australia (Private Practitioners Group).
Ha works 5 ½ days a week from 8am to 7pm most days with a 1-2 hour break
for lunch. He sees about 10 patients in the morning
and 14 -15 patients in the
afternoon. Mr Ha works alone but has a number of assistants who provide massage
therapy (after training
from Mr Ha). His clinic has 5 treatment tables and Mr Ha
says that usually 3 or 4 tables are simultaneously in use. He sees most
without a doctor’s referral and estimates that less than 1% of his
patients come with a referral.
Ha said he did not specialise but ran a general practice with an emphasis on
massage. He does not use locums and when he has 2
weeks leave at Christmas time
he closes his practice. Mr Ha stated that he does continuing professional
development (CPD) through
APA. He has attended courses which run for 1 day or a
weekend. He says he does not use a locum but closes his practice to attend
courses. He believes the last CPD course he did was more than 5 years ago.
The Evidence and the Tribunal’s Findings
Is the Tribunal comfortably satisfied that the Particulars of the
Complaints are proven?
Particular 1
32. Particular
As at around 16 August 2008, in respect of claims the practitioner made
to NIB, up to 10 to 15 percent of the claims were fraudulent
in that he claimed
benefits for a designated patient when he did not provide treatment for the
designated patient but he had treated
a family member of the designated
Ha made admissions in relations to Particular 1. Mr Ha frankly described to the
Tribunal the arrangements he had in place to swipe
the cards of family members
who had not had a treatment so as to facilitate payments by nib to cover the
“gap” for the
person actually receiving treatment.
said in his oral evidence that he generally saw all patients at their first
attendance, but that at later visits he may swipe the
card of a non attending
family member to gain a benefit for the patient continuing with treatment. He
admitted that he had claimed
benefits for patients he had not treated and that
he understood this contravened his agreement with HICAPS.
said many of his patients were poor or on the pension and that he wished to help
them. He regarded nib as a large wealthy organization.
He also said that
patients told him that other physiotherapists swiped the card of family members
to cover the “gap”
and asked him to do the same. He said, when a
patient said they would go elsewhere to get it done or if they were too poor, he
claim for a service not actually provided. He acknowledged that what he
“was not OK”
and that he knew that at the time. He
said he thought that if he admitted what he had done and paid back the money
all go away”.
well as making admissions in his oral evidence, Mr Ha has consistently made
general admissions in correspondence with nib and
the HCCC. In his letter to nib
of 8/9/08, he stated:
‘I admitted that I have claimed more benefit from nib for
some of my patient (sic) so that they do not pay out of pocket’.
37. In his statement dated 28/5/2012 Mr Ha said:
“I did admit that on 18 August 2008 I had processed claims
through HICAP in relation to family members to cover out of pocket
expenses...... If I processed a claim through HICAPS for another family member,
any excess benefits were recorded as a credit balance.’
38. The letter from Mr Ha’s solicitors to the HCCC dated 20/8/09
We are instructed that Mr Ha admits, and did so to Mr Casey, that
he did swipe the nib cards of some non-attending family members
for attending
for treatments on the same day as primary patients in order to reduce ‘out
of pocket’ expenses for the
attending family member.’
Ha also told the Tribunal that he had swiped cards to inappropriately obtain
benefits from HCF as well as nib. In April 2008 he
‘derecognised’ by HCF and although he was not formally advised of
the reason for this, he thought it was because
of his billing practice.
Nevertheless Mr Ha acknowledged he did not change his pattern of billing with
nib following this event.
was argument about whether it could be established that at or around 16 August
2008 up to 10 -15% of claims made by Mr Ha to
nib were fraudulent.
41. Mr Ha made an admission to that effect in cross
examination.
Q. Let's talk about some of the specifics of the conversation you had
with Mr Casey. At the audit on 16 August 2008 this is, you
Casey that up to ten to 15% of the NIB claims were false, is that
Q. Is it the case that up to ten to 15% of the claims you made from NIB
were false?
admission is consistent with his statement on the 16 August 2008 as reported by
Mr Scott Casey. Mr Casey, who impressed the
Tribunal as a credible witness,
gave evidence that he had made contemporaneous notes on the day he spoke with Mr
Ha and that he noted
Mr Ha to have specifically referred to 10-15% of fraudulent
claims when explaining his conduct in relation to nib.
Mr Ha has on other occasions referred to 10-15% of claims when discussing the
quantum of the fraudulent activity. Mr Ha’s
solicitor’s letter,
dated 20/8/09, states:
‘Mr Ha instructs us that, in reference to nib claims, he
said to Mr Casey that “up to 10-15% of the claims were fraudulent.
admits that he did make fraudulent claims for work he had not actually
Ha’s counsel argued that Mr Ha cannot be taken to have admitted something
that he could not know and which was only an estimate.
The written submissions
The Respondent cannot be taken to have admitted something
that he did not know and, though the Respondent does not resile from his
admission, the Tribunal can give little weight to an admission that is on its
face only an estimate. The exact proportion of nib
claims that were in fact
false is something the Respondent was, and has always been unable to, state with
HCCC introduced evidence from Mr Daryl Bull, who was, at the relevant time,
Manager of Claims and Provider Relations for nib Health
Funds. In his evidence
Mr Bull referred to Business Objects reports which detail Mr Ha’s claiming
for nib customers for the
period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008.
Business Objects report is generated by a computer program which searches for
indicators such as multiple family members receiving
treatments on the same day.
Nib regards this as a possible indicator of fraudulent activity. Mr Bull
acknowledged that nib conducts
such searches to minimise financial loss to nib,
but also to ensure benefits are paid appropriately and so to keep the total cost
of policies at a sensible and affordable level for members of the public.
Bull stated that in 2008 nib became aware of an irregular claiming pattern for
Mr Ha. The Business Objects reports in relation
to Mr Ha show numerous occasions
where claims were made for multiple members of the same family on the same days
over an extended
period of time, for example, up to six family members on one
day and three family members on the same day on twenty four occasions.
Objects report, 02051190, annexed to Mr Bull’s report, dated 6 November
2009, shows five members of the same family
treated on the same day on 12
separate days.
Bull stated that there was sufficient indication from the Business Objects
reports in relation to Mr Ha to trigger further investigation.
investigation was carried out by Mr Scott Casey and Ms Kathy Spong who visited
Mr Ha at his practice on 30 July 2008 and then
by Mr Scott Casey and Ms Kindness
who conducted an audit of Mr Ha’s practice on 16 August 2008.
likelihood of multiple family members attending for physiotherapy on the same
day was described as very unlikely by Mr Bull and
Ms Kindness. Ms Kindness
stated in oral evidence that it was highly unusual to treat multiple family
members on the same day particularly
when such treatments extended over time.
The likelihood that different family members would require the same pattern of
for treatment was extremely low. The Tribunal accepts the assessment
of the expert witnesses on this point. Further Mr Ha when asked
likelihood of four family members attending on the same day, stated that it was
unlikely and that he “
did not think that it would happen at
documentary evidence from nib suggests the likelihood that there was a
consistent pattern of irregular claiming by Mr Ha over
an extended period time.
The Tribunal accepts that Mr Ha, as the sole practitioner in and proprietor of
his practice, would be able
to realistically estimate his client base and the
extent of his aberrant claiming behavior. While it is not possible to exactly
the extent of his fraudulent claiming, the Tribunal is satisfied based
on Mr Ha’s admissions and the documentary and oral evidence
around August 2008 the quantum of the fraudulent claiming was up to 10 -15%.
51. Accordingly the Tribunal finds that Particular 1 is
Particulars 2 and 3
52. Particulars 2 and 3 allege:
During the period 12 November 2001 to 8 May 2002 the practitioner on 26
occasions made claim to benefits from NIB in respect of Patient
A to which he
was not entitled as he had not provided any treatment on those occasions to
Patient A. The particulars of the 26 occasions
are set out in Annexure A to the
During the period 9 November 2007 to 20 December 2007 on 11 occasions the
practitioner made claim to benefits from NIB in respect
of Patient A to which he
was not entitled as he had not provided any treatment on those occasions to
Patient A. Particulars of the
11 occasions are set out in Annexure B to the
Ha fully admitted the facts of Particulars 2 and 3. The Tribunal notes that Mr
Ha’s behaviour in relation to Particulars
2 and 3 is consistent with his
behaviour in relation to Particular 1. On the basis of Mr Ha’s admissions
and the oral and documentary
evidence, the Tribunal finds Particulars 2 and 3
Tribunal notes that in relation to Particulars 2 and 3, Mr Ha claimed that he
acted out of compassion for a financially disadvantaged
person with a severe
disability and that he gained no financial benefit. However in his
solicitor’s letter to the HCCC dated
20/8/09, in relation to false and
misleading claiming to nib, it was stated:
Mr Ha accepts
and acknowledges that he benefitted financially from what he did, and he knew
that he would’.
Particular 4
55. Particular 4 alleges:
During the period 30 July 2008 to 16 August 2008 the practitioner
destroyed original records of approximately 26 patients and rewrote
the entries
in respect of the patients in the clinical records. The patients whose records
were destroyed and whose clinical records
were rewritten are set out in Annexure
C to this Complaint
Ha admitted that he rewrote clinical notes and destroyed original records. This
is not in dispute. Ms Powell stated that while
there are no formal standards
which preclude a physiotherapist from destroying or rewriting clinical records,
this is a most unusual
practice and original records should generally be
retained. Ms Powell stated that notes would usually be made at the time of the
consultation or very shortly thereafter and if they were to be rewritten that
should occur within a day or two of the consultation.
issue in dispute between the parties is the timing of these events and the
inferences, if any, that can be made in relation to
them. 30 July 2008 was the
date on which representatives from nib first visited Mr Ha. They indicated to
him that they would return
for the purposes of an audit and did so on 16 August
2008. Mr Scott Casey advised Mr Ha on 30 July 2008 not to alter his clinical
records prior to the audit.
HCCC evidence
HCCC assert that Mr Ha rewrote the relevant clinical records between 30 July
2008 and 16 August 2008. Mr Casey’s report
dated 18/9/2008 states:
‘Upon initial inspection it was apparent that the records
had all been written up in the same handwriting and pen on the same
paper. I asked Mr Ha if (sic) he had written up the records since my last visit
and he said that he did. He alleged that
he had used original records to make
these records but when asked where the original records were, he stated that he
had thrown them
Casey’s report was based on contemporaneous notes made on the day of the
audit. These notes state,
‘Records written up for patients. Admitted writing up
records before audit. Asked where others were that were transcribed from
stated they had been thrown away.’
her report dated 18 August 2008, Ms Kindness describes aspects of the audit on
16 August 2008. She states,
“Mr Ha produced the requested treatment records. It was
immediately apparent that the records had all been written up on the
The writing was identical, the paper supposedly dating back 2 to 3 years was
identical; the colour of the pen used was
identical in all records. I asked Mr
Ha if he had written up records to meet the audit requirements. He stated that
he had. I asked
him why he had done this and he stated that his handwriting was
very bad and he had rewritten the records in order to make them more

Kindness also confirmed this in her oral evidence. She said that if notes had
been rewritten over a period of time one would expect
different pens and
different paper to be used. She stated that this was not the case here. The
paper was clean and uniform and had
not aged and the notes were all written in
cross examination she conceded that not all the notes were written in blue pen
and that she was not a forensic expert in handwriting.
However she maintained
her view that it was an unusual practice to destroy original contemporaneous
notes and to rewrite them to
make them legible. She said she had not seen this
done before and could not understand the reason for it, particularly as Mr Ha is
the only practitioner in the practice.
Mr Ha’s evidence
Ha said that his purpose in rewriting his notes was to improve the legibility of
his hand writing.
Ha said he rewrote the records over a longer period than is alleged in
Particular 4. He asserted he had been rewriting the notes
for a couple of
months, working his way from A to Z. Mr Ha said he began prior to the first
visit by Mr Casey on 30 July 2008, but
he acknowledged that he continued to
rewrite the notes after 30 July 2008. The letter from Mr Ha’s solicitor to
the HCCC dated
20/8/09 states,
Mr Ha admits, and did so to Mr Casey, that he did re-write some clinical
records of some patients in between Mr Casey’s visits.
Mr Ha instructs us
that, in very many instances, his original clinical notes were written in an
unreadable, hurried scrawl, and were
very difficult to read. Therefore, months
before Mr Casey's first visit, he started to rewrite them. ................The
of the records was not related at all to any fraudulent claims that
may have been made by Mr Ha........... What Mr Ha did in between
visits was merely to continue a work in progress. Mr Ha instructs us that
thousands of files were rewritten over several
months in this way – an
impossible task in the short period in between Mr Casey's visits.
Mr Ha confirmed in cross examination,
HCCC: So you did rewrite the notes for the NIB audit?
Ha: I did rewrite the note not just for the NIB audit and I want to
clarify that the time I rewrite the note I don’t put extra
day into it
just in case that’s what you think
asked if he told Mr Casey he rewrote the records for the purposes of the audit
on16 August 2008, Mr Ha said that he could not
recall what he said to Mr Casey.
He said there may have been a misunderstanding.
Ha stated in his oral evidence that he believed the purpose of the audit was to
examine false claims made to nib. He said,
“I think the way they talk they make me very nervous and
they did not indicate at any time that they would look into my clinical
The only thing they make me believe until they did find out whether I do any
false claim for the patient.”
Ha also asserted that he would not know which files would be examined and so
could not have rewritten the notes for the purpose
of the audit. However Mr Ha
also spoke of a list of patient files which Mr Casey had asked him to produce
and conceded that he was
aware of the files which nib would be interested in at
matters were put to Mr Ha in cross examination,
Q. After Mr Casey's first visit you knew that he was
coming back a second time?
Q. You knew he would ask for patient records?
Q. You knew that he would ask for NIB patient records?
Q. You knew he was particularly interested in people whose cards you
might have swiped for another family member?
Q. You could have identified those patients from your records couldn't
Ha claims that he rewrote the records for the purpose of improving legibility.
The Tribunal had the benefit of viewing the rewritten
records and had
significant difficulty in deciphering them. The Tribunal also noted that the
rewritten records were still sufficiently
illegible for it to be appropriate
that they be typed for the purpose of the Tribunal hearing. The Tribunal also
notes the evidence
of Ms Kindness, an experienced physiotherapist, who said she
could not understand Mr Ha’s stated reason for rewriting the records,
particularly as he is the only practitioner in the practice.
Ha says that he had been rewriting the notes for some time to improve
legibility. He says that he continued to do this to assist
with legibility for
the audit. But he also said that he thought the auditors were not interested in
reading or examining his notes
but were concerned only with the dates patients
attended as relevant to claims made to nib.
Ha made admissions in relation to the inadequacy of his clinical records. In
doing so he acknowledged that he is not particularly
interested in writing up
records as he is primarily focused on patient care and treatment. In the light
of this the Tribunal had
some difficulty in accepting Mr Ha's assertion that he
was rewriting clinical records over a period of months to improve their
legibility.
Considering all the circumstances and Mr Ha’s evidence as a
whole, the Tribunal felt his assertion lacked credibility.
Tribunal found that Mr Ha did destroy original records of approximately 26
patients and rewrote the entries in relation the patients
in the clinical
records. As to the timing of these events, two credible witnesses reported that
he admitted he had done it for the
purpose of the audit. Mr Ha acknowledged
some records were rewritten during the period in question. He had some
difficulty in directly
answering the questions put to him in relation to this
matter. The Tribunal found Mr Ha’s evidence on the purpose and timing
the rewriting lacked credibility. The Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that he did rewrite the notes during
the period 30 July 2008 to 16
August 2008.
73. Accordingly the Tribunal finds Particular 4 is proved.
Particulars 5 - 61 – General Comments
Particulars
5-61 deal with three related issues. The first is that Mr Ha’s initial
assessment of specific patients was inadequate
in that he failed to obtain
certain information or undertake a complete physical assessment, give warnings
or undertake appropriate
safety tests. The second issue relates to record
keeping and it is asserted that his initial assessment was inadequate in that he
failed to record certain information and failed to keep adequate records of his
assessment and treatment of specific patients over
the course of treatment. The
third allegation is that Mr Ha did not conduct or record reassessment of
specific patients and did
not change the treatment applied.
considering these Particulars the Tribunal considered all the oral and
documentary evidence, but had particular regard to Mr Ha’s
records; the typed version of these records; the report of Ms Helen Kindness;
the report of Ms Tracy Powell; the oral evidence
of Ms Tracy Powell and Mr

information, conduct physical assessments, undertake safety tests and

33, 35, 41, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 57)
Ha says that he did a proper initial assessment and asked adequate questions.
However he did not record all the information he
Tracey Powell, a physiotherapist who provided an expert opinion for the HCCC,
acknowledged in cross examination that it may be
possible that Mr Ha asked
relevant questions and obtained adequate information but simply did not record
it. She stated that generally
physiotherapists will indicate on the clinical
notes, by way of a tick, if a question has been asked. Mr Ha’s notes have
section referring to General Health and if this box is not ticked it would be
reasonable to assume no questions had been asked on
this issue. She said she was
unable to comment on the adequacy of the initial assessment as she had
insufficient information.
78. Ms Kindness in her report dated 18/8/2008 states,
“It was noted that the initial assessments were not thorough and did
not record any neurological tests even where referred leg
or arm symptoms were
noted. I asked Mr Ha if he had performed the tests. He stated that he did not
see the need to perform them and
mostly did not.
her oral evidence Ms Kindness conceded that she had not observed Mr Ha providing
treatment. Ms Kindness also acknowledged it was
not part of her role as an
auditor to assess the treatment provided by Mr Ha, however having been a peer
reviewer since 1988, she
had noted that he had not recorded relevant questions
for initial assessment.
summary, Mr Ha maintained that he asked relevant questions and conducted
adequate assessments but only recorded limited information.
Apart from Mr
Ha’s assertions, the only other evidence available on this issue is the
evidence of the written records themselves,
from which the inference might be
drawn that, as information was not recorded in accordance with professional
standards, that information
was not obtained.
aspect of the particulars was not pressed by the HCCC and the Tribunal
considered that there was insufficient evidence to establish,
to the requisite
standard, that Mr Ha had failed to obtain information, conduct physical
assessments, undertake safety tests and
give warnings.
82. Accordingly the Tribunal does not find this aspect of
Particulars 5 – 61 proved.
Record keeping
Unsatisfactory initial assessment – failure
to record information
Failure to keep adequate records of assessment
and treatment
(Particulars 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, 35, 41, 44, 46, 48,
52, 54, 57)
Ha admitted that his record keeping was inadequate. Ms Powell told the Tribunal
that in her expert opinion the clinical notes
were inadequate and invited her
strong criticism.
Ha said he uses a clinical notes form which had been used by a previous
employer. He said that he did not need to fill out everything
on the form. He
said he was nervous talking to Scott Casey and Ms Kindness on the day of the
audit. They asked him, in relation to
several patients, why he had not filled
out the form. He said
“I don’t have to fill it out for every
patient. They tell me what they want, what is their problem”.
stated that treatment is the main thing and he was most upset to think that it
was suggested that his treatment was inadequate.
Tribunal asked Mr Ha why aspects of the form are not filled in and he stated
that if a patient indicates that there is no problem
then he makes no record. He
only records a positive answer to a question.
Powell told the Tribunal that while some information is provided in the clinical
notes, there is insufficient detail. For example,
Mr Ha may note that a
patient’s injury occurred as a result of a motor vehicle accident, but it
is important to know more,
for example, if the patient was a passenger or the
driver and whether there were other injuries.
Powell stated that in her opinion the goals of treatment were not recorded by Mr
Ha. It was suggested to her that notations which
indicate that the patient
requested soft tissue massage or required stretching, indicate that the goals of
treatment are to relieve
pain. Ms Powell stated that usually the goals of
treatment relate to functional outcomes and are recorded as such.
Powell was asked about the safety signs in Mr Ha’s waiting room. It was
suggested that although Mr Ha had not recorded appropriate
warnings being given
to individual patients that the presence of the signs are sufficient to provide
such warnings. Ms Powell stated
that it was common practice to discuss
particular risks and provide warnings to patients and to make a note to that
effect in the
clinical records. She stated that it cannot be assumed that each
patient has read a warning sign in the waiting room.
Powell explained the risks in terms of future patient care associated with
inadequate notes and the difficulties for another physiotherapist
taking over
the care of a patient if notes have not been completed. Notes are also important
if a medical referral has been made
and a letter needs to be written to a
patient’s treating doctor or if a further referral is made.
90. Ms Kindness in her report dated 18/8/2008 states,
“It was noted that the initial assessments were not thorough and did
not record any neurological tests even where referred leg
or arm symptoms were
noted. I asked Mr Ha if he had performed the tests. He stated that he did not
see the need to perform them and
mostly did not. It was also noted that he did
not record responses to the general health questions or to exclude occult
disease processes
or malignancies. He stated that he did not record this
information unless it was present (it was not noted on any of the records
reviewed). It is also noted that Mr Ha does not record any functional
limitations or patient centred goals even though these questions
were present on
the assessment forms. There were almost no instances of recordings of diagnosis
or special questions associated with
certain clinical presentations. Mr Ha
stated that he was not interested in the paperwork; he preferred to spend hands
on time with
the patient rather than write notes.”
stated that Mr Ha told her there was too much paperwork to complete and he would
prefer to spend his time with the patient rather
than on paperwork. She stated
Mr Ha discussed how much time had been wasted in writing up assessments when he
worked in hospitals.
During cross examination Mr Ha stated that he did not
consider it necessary to record the goals of treatment.
comparing different patient notes, where treatment was recorded, it appeared
that identical treatments were applied irrespective
of the individual
patient’s presentation. In cross examination Mr Ha admitted that the
records did not differentiate his treatments,
which he claimed varied in
intensity and distribution. When there were a number of areas being treated it
was impossible to tell
which treatment was being applied to which area. He
admitted not recording significant aspects of treatment and he could not give
any reason why he did not.
Powell stated that the clinical notes were illegible. Mr Ha acknowledged this,
in that he told the Tribunal that he had rewritten
his notes to address this
problem and had also voluntarily typed his notes to assist the Tribunal.
cross examination Mr Ha was asked about various professional standards relating
to clinical record keeping including the NSW Physiotherapists
Registration
Board’s Policy on Professional Conduct, the NSW Physiotherapists
Registration Board’s Policy for documentation
in the physiotherapy
clinical record, the Australian Physiotherapy Association Code of Conduct and

all physiotherapists to maintain for every client
a confidential record which is
complete, legible and understandable - in essence to allow for the effective
evaluation of the client’s
progress and the physiotherapist’s
Ha stated that he was unfamiliar with these documents, although he agreed that
the policies and principles referred to were ones
with which he should comply.
“for physiotherapy we should know and we do all these
it was apparent to the Tribunal, that the records contained insufficient detail.
There was no evidence in his clinical records
that he did neurological testing
even when specifically indicated; asked precautionary safety questions in taking
the history; undertook
appropriate safety tests for EPA (electro physical
agents), for example interferential current; tested for adequacy of blood flow
to the head before giving treatment to the neck or gave routine warnings or
gained consent. There was no evidence of accurate measurement
patients’ condition or any measurement of outcome of treatments provided.
The specific goals of treatment were either
not identified or poorly identified.
Even when the notes did record something in this regard, it did not appear to
the Tribunal to
be a mutually agreed, measurable and functional outcome. In
addition, the records were illegible.
Powell found that the records generally fell significantly below the expected
standard and invited her strong criticism.
documentary evidence of the records themselves, the expert evidence of Ms Powell
and Mr Ha’s admissions allow the Tribunal
to be comfortably satisfied that
this aspect of Particulars 5 -61 is proved.
Reassessment - not conduct or record reassessment of specific
patients and not change the treatment applied.
(Particulars – 6,
20, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 45, 47, 49, 51, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61)
was little documentary evidence before the Tribunal in relation to how Mr Ha
conducted reassessments. Mr Ha generally asserted
that the treatment he provided
was adequate.
oral evidence he stated that on reassessment he asked how the patients felt,
however he admitted to not taking any objective measures
to ascertain if there
was actual improvement.
Tribunal : Did you at any time or did you routinely record any
objective measures in order to be able to establish whether or not
they actually
made any real improvement under your treatment?
Ha: I just ask them to see how they feel and they will just show me how
asked about what indicators justify ongoing treatments, Mr Ha said treatment
should continue ‘
if the patients feel better, pay for the treatment and
ask me to keep providing the treatment for them’
. After repeated
questioning, Mr Ha was able to identify that some active examination to assess
if there has been improvement is appropriate.
He did acknowledge that it was not
sufficient to just ask the patient if they were feeling better.
relation to the allegation that he did not change the treatments applied, Mr Ha
said in oral evidence that he provides treatment
according to what patient feels
HCCC did not press this aspect of the Particulars and in the same way the
Tribunal was unable to form a view about the adequacy
of Mr Ha’s initial
assessments, the Tribunal considered there was insufficient evidence to
establish, to the requisite standard,
that Mr Ha had failed to conduct adequate
reassessments or change treatments as required.
Mr Ha did admit that his record keeping was inadequate and there was
considerable evidence to support that conclusion. Mr
Ha acknowledged that he
made no records in relation to improvement of the patient’s condition and
he demonstrated little insight
into the requirement to remeasure patient
HCCC submitted that in light of the absence, in many records, of evidence of
reassessment or a record of a response to treatment,
and the difficulty
Mr Ha had in answering questions about the importance of this, it is often
not possible to “sense from the
records that the clinical process has been
applied for the patient’s benefit”.
documentary evidence of the records themselves, the expert evidence of Ms Powell
and Mr Ha’s admissions allow the Tribunal
to be comfortably satisfied that
this aspect of Particulars 5 -61 is proved in so far as it relates to Mr
Ha’s record keeping.
Tribunal finds Particulars 5-61 to be proved on the basis of Mr Ha’s
unsatisfactory record keeping. The Tribunal does not
make findings in relation
to the allegations that Mr Ha failed to undertake adequate initial assessments
or appropriate reassessments.
However Mr Ha’s admissions and the
documentary and oral material before the Tribunal provide sufficient evidence to
Tribunal to find Particulars 5-61 proven on the basis that Mr Ha
failed to properly record information at both initial and subsequent
assessments.
Does Mr Ha’s conduct amount to unsatisfactory
professional conduct and/or professional misconduct?
Legal framework
109. Unsatisfactory professional conduct is defined
in S139B of the National Law to include:
(a) Conduct significantly below reasonable standard
Conduct that demonstrates the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed or
the care exercised by the practitioner in the practice of
practitioner’s profession is significantly below the standard reasonably
expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level
of training of

purported practice of the practitioner’s profession.

Tribunal in
Re A Medical Practitioner and the Medical Practice Act (40010 of
At paragraph 12 the Tribunal observed: "As a general principle, the
use of the term, ‘significant’ may in law be taken

terms ‘improper conduct’ or ‘unethical conduct’ are not
defined in the National Law, however conduct
is defined in section 138 to mean
any act or omission. In the absence of a statutory definition, words should
generally be given
their ordinary meaning. Improper conduct in its ordinary
meaning is conduct which is incorrect or wrongful. It refers to behaviour

conduct is arguably a more serious matter than improper conduct and is generally
defined to mean immoral or contrary to
moral precepts. The honesty of a
practitioner is an appropriate consideration when assessing whether or not that
practitioner is
guilty of unethical conduct. In
Veterinary Practitioners
Board of New South Wales v Johnson
[20l0]NS WADT 308 the Tribunal said, in
considering the conduct of a veterinarian who had lied about the circumstances
of an animal’s
death and falsified records relating to that death,
"There are numerous authorities to the effect that professionals
are required to be honest in their dealings with others:
(NSWCA, 15 July 1994, unreported). The majority of the Court of
Appeal held that, even if the practitioner was otherwise of good
character and
reputation, the dishonest reporting established that he was "not of good
character" in respect of the practice of medicine.
Honesty is a critical quality
required in the character of a medical practitioner (
Priestley JA at 86)..................... Similarly, in
Medical Tribunal of NSW stated that the dishonesty inherent in some of Dr
Matter’s conduct constituted "very serious professional
misconduct" and
that behaviour was "grossly unethical".

It has also been said in relation to the medical profession that the
conduct, or the subject of the complaint, has to be of such a
departure from the
accepted standards as would reasonably incur the strong reprobation of
professional colleagues of good repute
and competence:
Qidwai v Brown
[1984] 1 NSWLR 100
; Ex parte Meehan; Re Medical Practitioners Act
[1965] NSWLR 30.
Particulars 1, 2 and 3
Tribunal has found Particulars 1, 2 and 3 proven. The Tribunal is satisfied that
each Particular constitutes unsatisfactory professional
conduct, because it is
conduct which is significantly below the standard reasonably expected of a
practitioner of an equivalent level
of training or experience and also because
it is improper and unethical conduct.
Ha made false and misleading claims to nib health fund for the purpose of
obtaining a benefit in circumstances where no service
was rendered. This
Tribunal is a professional disciplinary tribunal which has no jurisdiction to
determine whether or not Mr Ha is
guilty of fraudulent conduct in a criminal
sense. The Tribunal does not make any findings of this nature, but notes that Mr
his own admission characterises his conduct as fraudulent.
Ha has behaved in a dishonest and reprehensible manner. His conduct in relation
to nib is serious both in terms of its nature
and its duration. The evidence
reveals the likelihood of a consistent pattern of irregular claiming over an
extended period time.
It is established by Particular 1 that around August 2008
up to 10 to 15% of claims made to nib were fraudulent. Particulars 2 and
a period in 2001/2002 and 2007 respectively. Further, Mr Ha undertook this
dishonest conduct intentionally and deliberately.
He knew what he was doing was
wrong and continued to do it. Even after HCF derecognised him for similar
conduct he persisted in lodging
false claims with nib.
Ha’s conduct demonstrates a systematic approach to false and misleading
claiming. His conduct cannot be understood as a
series of random or unplanned
events. The Business Objects reports provided by nib show a pattern of family
billing consistent with
systemic fraudulent activity. Mr Ha initiated and
maintained this activity with the knowledge that he would gain a financial
at least in the sense of maintaining his client base.
relation to Particulars 2 and 3 the same kind of fraudulent conduct occurred in
respect of one patient but on 37 occasions over
a considerable period of time
– on 26 occasions in a six month period in 2001/2002 and on 11 occasions
in one month in 2007.
Again this conduct can be understood as a deliberate and
intentional effort to defraud nib. Mr Ha asserts that he acted out of altruistic
motives in relation to this client. The Tribunal does not accept that altruism
was Mr Ha’s sole motivation as he also gained
a financial advantage. Even
if altruism was his primary motive, that in itself is not sufficient to abrogate
the seriousness of his
expert evidence before the Tribunal is that Mr Ha’s conduct is
significantly below the standard expected of a practitioner
of equivalent
training and experience. Ms Tracey Powell’s evidence was
The NIB card should only be swiped for treatment given to
the appropriate patient. To do otherwise is fraudulent, and falls significantly
below the acceptable standard.
Ha’s actions reveal serious and persistent dishonesty and this is an
appropriate consideration when assessing whether or
not his conduct is improper
and unethical. The public has the right to expect that health professionals,
including physiotherapists,
act with integrity, honesty and accountability. Not
only has Mr Ha’s conduct undermined the trust and confidence the public
might have in him as a physiotherapist it also reflects poorly on the profession
as a whole.
HCCC submitted and the Tribunal accepts that, as with medical practitioners, the
community places a high degree of trust in physiotherapists:
HCCC v Duong
[2010] NSWPYT 1
HCCC v Margiotta
[2007] NSWPYT 1
Tribunal held:
The offending conduct of the Respondent occurred
over two discrete and significant periods of time. They cannot be characterised
isolated or ‘one off’ or in response to a single acute episode of
desperate financial need. The offending conduct involves
an abuse of the
position of trust that is reposed in the professionals who provide health care
services. A person who cannot be trusted
to act in accordance with the ethics
and standards of a profession should not remain entitled to be considered to be
a member of
that profession. The principles of protection of the public,
protection of the reputation of the profession and maintenance of the
of the public in the profession all fundamentally require trustworthy conduct on
the part of members of the profession.
The conduct of the Respondent clearly was
a breach of trust. The Respondent as a registered physiotherapist should have
dishonesty was not in any way an acceptable part of the practice of
physiotherapy.
is also a relationship of trust between an insurer and a practitioner. To engage
in fraudulent conduct to a significant extent,
and over an extended period of
time, suggests a serious breach of both types of trust:

HCCC v Harper
[2009] NSWCHT 1
[4], [17], [80];
Dr Suman Sood
[2006] NSWMT 1
[279]-[283].
Tribunal is comfortably satisfied that each of Particulars 1, 2 and 3 constitute
unsatisfactory professional conduct. The Tribunal
is also comfortably satisfied
that in relation to each of Particulars 1, 2 and 3 the unsatisfactory
professional conduct is of a
sufficiently serious nature to justify suspension
or cancellation of the practitioner’s registration and accordingly,
constitutes
professional misconduct.
Particular 4
4 has been proven. The rewriting of clinical notes and the destruction of
original records, although unorthodox and not
necessarily prudent, is not in
itself sufficient to constitute unsatisfactory professional conduct.
having found that the rewriting occurred during the period between the first
visit from nib staff and the subsequent audit,
and having regard to the
evidence as a whole, the Tribunal is satisfied that the inference can be drawn
that the rewriting was undertaken
for the purpose of attempting to conceal Mr
Ha’s fraudulent conduct.
Tribunal does not accept Mr Ha’s explanation that the notes were rewritten
for the purpose of improving legibility. Mr
Ha is a sole practitioner who does
not use locums. It is unlikely that another professional would be reading his
clinical notes.
Mr Ha could have rewritten the notes for his own benefit.
However the rewritten notes remain illegible and needed to be typed for
purposes of the Tribunal hearing. By his own admission, Mr Ha is not interested
in paperwork and his assertion that he had spent
months rewriting notes, lacked
credibility, especially as there was no appreciable improvement in the
legibility of the rewritten
notes .The Tribunal considered Mr Ha’s
evidence in relation to his motive for rewriting the notes not to be reliable.
HCCC referred the Tribunal to the decision in
Palmer v Dolman
and submitted that in a civil case when assessing circumstantial
The inference drawn from the proved facts must be
weighed against realistic possibilities as distinct from possibilities that
be regarded as fanciful.
Where the competing possibilities are of equal likelihood or the choice
between them can only be resolved by conjecture, the allegation
HCCC v Rutner
[2009] NSWDT 2
, the Dental Tribunal, in assessing
circumstantial evidence, considered whether there is another reasonable
explanation and whether
the circumstances raise a more probable inference than
what is alleged. The Tribunal accepts the HCCC submission that in such
situations,
it is enough if the circumstances appearing in the
evidence give rise to a reasonable and definitive inference”.
evidence before the Tribunal supports the inference that Mr Ha’s actions,
in rewriting the notes between 30 July 2008 and
16 August 2008, were an adjunct
to his fraudulent scheme. Mr Ha had been involved in fraudulent claiming with
nib. He was aware that
his false claims had been identified. He was aware that
nib inspectors were coming to his practice to conduct an audit. The Tribunal
does not accept Mr Ha’s assertion that he rewrote the notes to improve
legibility. The most likely explanation for the rewriting
of the clinical
records and the destruction of the original records is an attempt by Mr Ha to
align his written records with his
claims to nib. The Tribunal considers there
is no other reasonable explanation for this conduct.
this basis the Tribunal finds Mr Ha’s conduct, as set out in Particular 4,
to be improper and unethical and to constitute
unsatisfactory professional
conduct on that basis. As the HCCC submitted,
The intention to
conceal fraudulent conduct demonstrates at the very least an inadvertence to the
proprieties of practice and, for
that reason is a serious breach of the trust
placed in physiotherapists.
4 evidences behaviour which is consistent with the behaviour described in
Particulars 1, 2 and 3 and a finding of professional
misconduct can be made when
Particular 4 is considered together with those Particulars.
should be noted that counsel for Mr Ha argued that logically it is not possible
for Mr Ha to have, on the one hand destroyed original
clinical notes and
rewritten them prior to the audit, and on the other hand, fraudulently claimed
for treatment for non attending
family members and fabricated notes for the
purposes of the audit. The former presupposes that patients were in fact treated
the latter presupposes they were not.
Tribunal asked Mr Ha about whether or not an initial consultation occurred with
each of the patients identified in the complaint.
Mr Ha was shown each original
patient record and asked to verify if he had in fact conducted an initial
assessment of that patient.
In each case he confirmed he had done so. Mr Ha
admitted to consulting with patients initially and to only fraudulently claiming
after the initial assessment.
Particulars 5 -61
Particulars
5 – 61 are proven in so far as they relate to the inadequacy of Mr
Ha’s record keeping.
Tribunal is satisfied that the clinical notes are incomplete as they do not
contain sufficient information for safe and effective
physiotherapy practice.
Even when Mr Ha did record some elements such as the mechanism of injury or
social history, the detail of
these findings are minimal and very inadequate.
The records are also generally illegible and would not be easily understood by
practitioner. The problems identified in Mr Ha’s records are not
isolated or sporadic problems, but appear to be widespread
across all records
cited. The clinical notes were strikingly similar in their lack of detail and
pattern of recording, for example
there were no recordings relating to patient
warnings and screening for safety issues.
records gave rise to concerns in the mind of the Tribunal in relation to public
safety. It would be very difficult for another
practitioner to provide follow up
care and indeed it would appear to be difficult for Mr Ha himself at later
consultations to have
access to information concerning the patient’s
original condition or to retain sufficient information to maintain continuity
Tribunal also had significant concern that Mr Ha’s oral evidence revealed
a poor attitude to note taking and a lack of
insight and knowledge about what
constituted good record keeping and why it is necessary.
Tribunal, as an expert Tribunal, has considered the documentary evidence of the
clinical records. The Tribunal also accepts the
expert evidence of Ms Powell
that the records fall well below the standard expected of a practitioner with
the equivalent of Mr Ha’s
training and experience. On the basis of this
evidence and Mr Ha’s admissions, the Tribunal is satisfied that each
as proven, constitutes unsatisfactory professional conduct.
HCCC urged the Tribunal to find, in accordance with the decision in
(unreported NSWMT, 20 August 2008), that Mr Ha’s failure to
keep proper records could in itself constitute professional misconduct.
Dr Lindsay was in a quite different situation to Mr Ha. Dr Lindsay’s
record keeping had been the subject of concern
and investigation by the Medical
Board for some period of time. Conditions had been imposed on his registration
designed to improve
his record keeping. These conditions had no effect. Dr
Lindsay had been a party to previous disciplinary proceedings in which
had been made and established about his record-keeping, similarly
without any impact on his practice.
Judge Walmsley accepted that Dr Lindsay’s poor record
keeping was professional misconduct, in a situation where repeated efforts
been made to address the issue of record keeping and Dr Lindsay had adopted a
deliberate course of action to the contrary. This
is not the case with Mr Ha and
the Tribunal is not satisfied that Particulars 5 – 61 constitute
professional misconduct, when
considered either individually or taken
Summary of Findings – Complaints and Particulars
The Tribunal finds the complaints of unsatisfactory
professional conduct and professional misconduct as particularised respectively,
in Complaints 1 and 2 proved and accordingly, the Respondent is guilty of
professional misconduct.
Particulars
The Tribunal finds the complaints of unsatisfactory
professional conduct and professional misconduct as particularised respectively,
in Complaints 1 and 2 proved and accordingly, the Respondent is guilty of
professional misconduct.
The Tribunal finds Particular 4 in Complaint 1 proved and
accordingly the Respondent is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct.
The Tribunal also finds that Particular 4 in Complaint 2 is proved in that
Particular 4 when considered together with Particulars
1, 2 and 3 amounts to
conduct of a sufficiently serious nature to justify suspension of cancellation
of the Respondent’s registration.
Accordingly, the Respondent is guilty of
professional misconduct.
Particulars 5 – 61
The Tribunal finds Particulars 5 - 61 in Complaint 1 proven as they relate to
inadequate record keeping and accordingly the Respondent
is guilty of
unsatisfactory professional conduct in relation to each Particular.
The Tribunal does not find that Particulars 5 - 61 in Complaint 2, when
considered individually or taken together, constitute professional
misconduct.
Tribunal having found the Respondent guilty of professional misconduct and
unsatisfactory professional conduct as recorded above
will reconvene on a date
to be fixed to consider evidence and submissions as to appropriate protective
orders in accordance with
the National Law.
