Stirrings: Torres Strait Islander Inquiry
Torres Strait Islander
A Commonwealth Inquiry ('the Inquiry') was established following a reference
by Senator John Herron on 15 August 1996 to the House
of Representatives
Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The terms
of reference of the Inquiry are:
Whether the people of the Torres Strait would benefit from a greater degree
of autonomy;
What forms should a greater autonomy take;
What are the implications for Torres Strait Islanders resident outside the
Torres Strait region of receiving greater autonomy, including
whether ATSIC or
the Torres Strait Regional Authority should represent the interests of such
The Inquiry has already taken a range of submissions and evidence during late
1996, and will recommence taking oral evidence in February/March
this year. It
has also held a few public hearings - in Townsville, Cairns and on Thursday
Islandand is preparing to hold further
hearings in Brisbane, Sydney, Rockhampton
and other cities and towns.
Judy Middlebrook is Secretary for the House of Representatives Standing
Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.
(Craig Dukes is
Secretary for the Inquiry itself.) She has told the ALB that although receipt of
submissions has formally closed,
the Inquiry still welcomes submissions until
approximately April this year.
The Chair, Hon Lou Lieberman MP, noted that the Inquiry is complicated by a
number of factors. A primary concern is that, while approximately
6,500 Torres
Strait Islanders live in the Torres Strait Islands, roughly 21,000 live on the
mainland. Issues likely to be discussed
throughout the Inquiry include whether,
and how, any arrangement made will apply to those on the mainland, and how to
structure the
use of available funds. The Torres Strait Regional Authority, the
body currently responsible for administering the Torres Strait
Islands, receives
funds from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.
It is anticipated that the Inquiry will table its report in the House of
Representatives sometime between July-September 1997.
An information booklet about the Inquiry is available. Copies of the booklet,
