PLPR moves on
Graham Greenleaf
With this issue completing volume 11 of PLPR at over 240 pages, we begin a
new year and reach another turning point. It is almost
twelve years since the
first issue of
in March 1994 opened
with ‘High Court confirms privacy right against governments’, a
report on the promising case of
Johns v ASC,
which like so many
Australian promises of privacy protection has not amounted to much in succeeding
years. One hundred and eight issues
later, we believe that PLPR has made a
substantial contribution to the protection of privacy in Australia. Our
contribution has principally
been in publishing critical analyses of the
deficiencies of successive waves of proposed (and often aborted) legislation, of
ill-advised
government schemes to extend the surveillance capacities of its
agencies, of missed international opportunities such as the APEC
Framework, and
of the various degrees of inaction or misdirection of Privacy Commissioners from
time to time. Less frequently, but
often enough to create hope, there have been
positive actions – legislative, administrative, but only rarely judicial -
report and support. PLPR has taken a ‘pro-privacy’ editorial line
in the sense of regarding privacy as a value not yet
adequately protected in
Australian law, while always publishing views critical of privacy protections
when available to us. Twelve
years of publication with such an approach has
given our online archive on AustLII a body of work of permanent relevance to
policy and research. Co-incidentally, this last issue of PLPR in its
current form co-incides with the announcement of a major two
year review of
provides a good opportunity to use
the experience we have reported on since 1994
to help design even better privacy protection.
The continuing relatively low level of professional and business interest in
to continue as a
commercial publication. We wish to thank CCH Australia for its support and
involvement in the publication of Volume
11 but we have mutually decided that is
not a viable path ahead.
The future for PLPR will be different. We expect to announce in the next
couple of months a new model of privacy publication which
will carry the name
forward, with the involvement of many
of the people who have been responsible for its success in the past, as a free
access and open
content publication. Watch this space.
For the moment we should conclude by saying ‘thank-you’. Our
original publishers, Oliver Freeman and Prospect Publishing
for volumes 1-7 and
Butterworths (LexisNexis) for volumes 8-10 provided support and professionalism
that enhanced our content. Our
Editorial Board members, many of whom have been
‘on board’ since the earliest issues, have provided much of our most
valuable content, and we trust they will be with us in future. Jill Matthews
indexed Volumes 1-10 and provided support through thick
and thin. And finally
both our contributors and our readers have kept us going with their continuing
positive comments about the
value of PLPR both as a venue in which to publish
and a publication to read. We thank you all.
