over the Internet, which
reflects a certain amount of creative effort, and which
is created outside of professional routines and

Despite the industry’s meteoric rise, questions surrounding copyright

of UGC associated specifically with video

to fill the gap by providing a comprehensive legal analysis of UGC in video

context. UGC, together with its copyright
implications, poses a conundrum for copyright scholars on a global

suggests that the indifference exhibited by platforms stems from the approach
taken by game companies, which generally refrain
from initiating complaints or
legal actions against platforms, and suggests labelling instances of theoretical

As the video game landscape evolves, navigating the intersection of UGC and
of intellectual
property (IP) resulting from user-generated content, players must adhere to the
regulations/legal framework outlined
in the end-user licence agreement (EULA),
or similar terms provided by game
publishers;
this agreement
defines the permissible scope of usage and limitations of such use, as well as
the implications of breach of, or non-compliance
with, the terms and conditions
to which players are required to consent in order to play the video game. These
terms may vary between
different games and can often be intricate and
challenging to understand. Clarifying the legal framework surrounding video game
is essential to foster innovation while safeguarding intellectual
property rights.
In cases where creators lack explicit authorisation (typically outlined in
EULAs), they must rely on legal limitations and exceptions
to avoid copyright
infringement. This approach is more viable in jurisdictions with specific
exceptions for UGC, such as Canada,
or flexible copyright doctrines such as fair
use in the United States, compared with the stricter, closed-list exceptions in
European Union and United Kingdom. However, these legal arguments remain
largely untested in court, as disputes are often swiftly
resolved through the
notice-and-takedown process rather than formal litigation.
This study seeks to explore the pressing legal questions surrounding video
game UGC, focusing on the copyright implications and regulatory
Specifically, it investigates the legal uncertainties faced by UGC creators and
the broader impact of EULAs in shaping
content usage. The research question
guiding this study is: How does the regulatory framework governing UGC in video
games reconcile
intellectual property rights with evolving user practices? To
address this, the article will examine the legal classification of
UGC and the
role of EULAs in regulating UGC; and
finally, it will propose solutions to balance copyright protection with creative
expression.
By clarifying these legal complexities, this study aims to
contribute to an informed regulatory approach that safeguards intellectual
property while fostering innovation in the gaming industry.
2. User-Generated Content in Video Games
The core essence of UGC lies in its ability to encompass various forms of
creativity, primarily centred around the reuse of existing
owned by third parties. This is particularly evident in the realm of video game
UGC, where the content typically
originates from copyrighted works owned by game
publishers or developers.
As multifaceted creations, games comprise diverse copyrightable elements such
as video (e.g., cutscenes), graphics (e.g., character
design), audio (e.g.,
soundtrack) and literary works (e.g.,

of game development may be outsourced, ownership rights typically revert to the

These same principles appear in UGC policies but in a different context, thus
framing originality as a condition for permission to

policies, despite
the possibility that a user could be considered an original
creator without being the legal author of a work. This framework distinguishes
game UGC from traditional creative works, prompting criticism for its
inconsistent treatment of
In this legal
landscape, users are left with limited options to assert their authorial claim

in scenarios such as creating a playthrough video, which often involves

There are three types of LP videos: reviews, playthrough videos with
commentary and playthrough videos without commentary. The first
constitutes reviews of video games. In the second category, a viewer can watch
the entire or part of the video game being

commentary on their experience. In the third category, viewers can watch videos

response to this complex legal landscape, the video games industry has adopted
an alternative
approach to regulate user creativity: contracts. Game companies
now view users not merely as passive consumers but as active creators
in understanding the rights licensed to them for interactive game creation. The
end-user licence agreement (EULA), traditionally
accompanying games at the point
of sale, now includes extensive terms, conditions and policies dedicated to
regulating UGC.

example, Blizzard, the publisher of

A study conducted by Thomas examined the UGC policies of 30 popular game
titles from 30 different publishers, chosen on the basis

The analysis involved
reviewing the latest versions of EULAs, terms and conditions, and other
UGC-related documents available as
of 21 December 2021, resulting in a total of
61 documents (approximately two per game title).
Thomas’s analysis categorised UGC policies into eight specific
activities: video creation, monetisation, screenshots and game
photography,
soundtrack usage, fan works, merchandise, mods, and commercial use. Each
activity was assessed to determine whether
it was permitted, conditionally
allowed or prohibited. The creation of video content, both streamed and
prerecorded, is the most
frequently permitted UGC activity without conditions,
authorised by the majority of rights-holders in the dataset. This widespread
permission aligns with the dominance of game streams and prerecorded videos in
the UGC landscape.
When conditions are attached to video creation, they often reflect existing

quality and nature of the content. For
instance, restrictions may include
prohibitions on videos that contain spoilers or pre-release footage to protect a
commercial viability and longevity (Rockstar
Other conditions aim to

content that is ‘obscene, sexually explicit, defamatory, offensive,

‘objectionable’
These conditions
allow game creators to determine what content aligns with the ‘spirit and
tone’ of their game and the
quality of its use. Even a minimal
quantitative use of copyrighted material can be deemed qualitatively
significant,
potentially leading
to infringement; UGC policies therefore focus more on the quality of the
user’s interaction with the game.
This qualitative assessment prioritises
the nature and originality of the user’s content over the amount of game
footage shown.
Among other key findings of the study was a significant variation in how game
companies handled screenshots and game photography.
While 14 allowed it without
conditions, 14 prohibited it and one permitted it with conditions. This
disparity may stem from the perceived
value of static images, which can be more
closely associated with a game’s brand compared with more dynamic and less
predictable
video content. Despite the general view of UGC creators as
non-commercial entities, a notable number of companies allowed UGC monetisation
(seven unconditionally, 12 with conditions). However, this permission was
narrowly defined. Monetisation was typically linked to
the creator’s
originality and creativity, emphasising content that adds value rather than
merely replicating existing material.
Conditions for monetisation often aimed to
protect the game’s integrity and community standards, allowing companies
to withdraw
monetisation rights if the content was deemed harmful or
inappropriate. The differing approaches to screenshots and monetisation
broader concerns about brand integrity and community engagement. By examining
these policies, the study provides insight
into the balance game publishers seek
between encouraging creative expression and maintaining control over their
intellectual property.
While Thomas’s study examined the UGC policies of popular game titles,
Mezei and Harkai's study examined EULAs and the flexibilities

Their analysis highlighted that end-users cannot negotiate the contractual

all. In the context of streaming sites with hosting services, YouTube and Twitch

due to their prominence in UGC. The study of

emphasise that the terms outlined in these agreements are non-negotiable and
presented on a take-it-or-leave-it
basis. Given that users often do not engage

are effectively nullified. This non-negotiable nature
underscores the inherent limitations in the practical utility of EULAs for
average user as well as (its limitation) in enforcing the terms stipulated in
the Agreement, due to the unfair bargaining power
between the parties.
An in-depth examination of EULAs brings to the surface additional nuances
that challenge the efficacy of EULAs in effectively safeguarding
user interests,
as observed by Corbett, whose analysis reveals that EULAs attached to computer
games tend to be remarkably similar
across different jurisdictions –
likely because they are often copied from other games or created using online
templates without
careful legal
This international
convergence of EULAs may also be due to terms that purport to exclude
user-permitted exceptions in the copyright
laws of various countries.
Rights-owners appear somewhat complacent about the enforceability of their
EULAs, relying on research
indicating that only a small fraction of users
actually read the contractual documents to which they agree, with the majority
into contracts without understanding the contents or potential
consequences.
However, this complacency is problematic. For players of Massively
Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), many terms in
EULAs infringe
upon their rights as both consumers and users of intellectual property. The
reality is that these standardised agreements
often fail to account for the
legal nuances of different jurisdictions, leading to potential conflicts. This
situation is unsatisfactory
and underscores the need for a more conscientious
approach to the formulation of EULAs, ensuring they respect user rights and
to legal standards across different regions.
Lau’s analysis of Blizzard Entertainment’s EULAs in the context
of the decentralised Web 3.0 Metaverse highlights critical
issues related
to legal complexity and the imbalance of negotiating
EULAs, notorious for
their dense legalese, pose a significant cognitive challenge for the average
user, leading to superficial reading
or complete disregard of the terms. This
lack of thorough engagement results in users unknowingly consenting to terms
that they do
not fully understand. Furthermore, the inherent power asymmetry in
these agreements places users at a disadvantage, relegating them
to accept the
terms unilaterally imposed by the software provider without the opportunity to
negotiate or contest unfavourable conditions.
This dynamic undermines the
concept of informed consent and marginalises user autonomy in contractual
engagements.
4. Exploring Solutions
In addressing the complexities and issues of EULAs for UGC in video games,
several solutions are proposed to enhance clarity and fairness
solutions) and the positive impacts on game sales (pro-publisher solutions). The
proposed solutions do not merely aim to
resolve technical legal ambiguities;
they also contribute to an evolving narrative about creativity and authorship in
digital gaming
environments. Traditional EULAs often reflect a narrative of
corporate control, framing user creativity as a form of licence-dependent
activity. By contrast, emerging regulatory and cultural trends – such as
the transparency mandate of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and
the rise of platforms such as
Decentraland
– promote a
more participatory narrative, where users are seen as co-creators within
expansive digital worlds.
One significant issue is the complexity and legalistic nature of EULAs, which
are often difficult for the average user to comprehend.
To mitigate this
problem, it is essential to mandate that EULAs be rewritten in plain language,
so the lay user can understand the
terms and conditions contained therein,
including the rights they retain and those they grant to publishers.
Importantly, the GDPR
explicitly enshrines the principle of transparency,
requiring that any information addressed to the public or data subjects be
easily accessible and easy to
understand.
obligation extends to the use of clear and plain language, supplemented by
visual elements where appropriate – particularly
in technologically
complex contexts such as online data collection and advertising. Given that
certain groups, such as children,
require specific protection, the GDPR further
mandates that any information intended for them be presented in language they
comprehend. Thus, ensuring that EULAs adhere to these legal
transparency requirements is not merely a best practice but a regulatory
Additionally, the development of standardised EULA templates, which clearly
outline UGC terms, should be implemented. Publishers should
explicitly state in
their EULAs whether UGC is permitted, and if so what kinds and under which
conditions. The diverging EULA approaches
discussed above illustrate competing
narratives around digital creativity. Balancing the protection of intellectual
property with
the encouragement of fair use/dealing and creative freedom
presents a significant challenge. Including explicit fair use/dealing
in EULAs would allow players to create and share content without fear of legal
repercussions, provided they adhere to
specified guidelines. Additionally,
creating collaborative platforms where players and developers can discuss and
negotiate the terms
of UGC creation would foster a community-driven approach to
content creation, ensuring that the interests of both parties are
considered.
Research highlights that the creation of official guidelines for gameplay
approval significantly impacts game sales, varying by
The rationale behind this
difference is that action games, role-playing games (RPG) and sports games
emphasise the player’s
experience, such as the thrill of gameplay and
competition with friends.
For these genres, simply knowing the
storyline from gameplay-related content does not deter purchases. Instead,
watching gameplay
can inspire viewers to want to experience the game themselves,
develop in-game characters and engage in competition, thereby significantly
influencing their willingness to buy the game.
To leverage the above, genre-specific strategies for UGC and gameplay
approvals should be developed. For instance, story-driven games
may benefit from
stricter guidelines to prevent spoilers, while action games may benefit from
more lenient guidelines that encourage
user creativity and
engagement.
Implementing dynamic
guidelines that can be adjusted based on the game’s life-cycle and user

necessary early in a game’s release, whereas more lenient guidelines could
user interest and engagement over time.
5. Concluding Remarks
As frontier technologies such as virtual worlds reshape creative practices,
the legal frameworks that govern them will increasingly
serve as narrative tools
– encoding values about who creates and who owns. The exponential growth
of online gaming, driven
by UGC and live streaming, has pushed the industry to
new heights, with platforms such as Twitch and the burgeoning eSports sector
demonstrating impressive expansion. However, this rapid development brings forth
intricate legal and regulatory challenges, particularly
concerning copyright
enforcement and user rights. UGC, epitomised by LP videos, has become integral
to the gaming culture, yet it
operates in a legally ambiguous space, often
skirting the boundaries of copyright law. The current European legal discourse
a comprehensive analysis of UGC’s copyright implications, leading to
a precarious state of ‘tolerated infringement’,
where content
creators operate with limited protection. The industry’s reliance on EULAs
to regulate UGC therefore underscores
the need for these agreements to be clear
and equitable.
EULAs should evolve to reflect the distinctive attributes of decentralised
platforms, addressing the unique legal complexities they
present. The analysis
of Blizzard Entertainment’s EULAs, as discussed by Lau, highlights the
critical issues of legal complexity
and power asymmetry. To ensure user rights
are protected and foster innovation, it is imperative that EULAs are crafted
with transparency
and fairness, allowing for informed consent and user
As the video game industry continues to advance, navigating the intersection
of UGC and copyright law remains a pressing concern.
Legal professionals and
industry experts should work together to develop EULAs that are not only legally
sound, but also reflect
the dynamic and participatory nature of modern gaming.
By doing so, the industry can ensure that it remains innovative and inclusive
while safeguarding intellectual property rights and fostering a respectful and
legally compliant user community.
