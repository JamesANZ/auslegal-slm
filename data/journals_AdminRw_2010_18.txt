Norfolk Island: administrative law reform
Norfolk Island: administrative law reform
On 17 March 2010 the Australian Government introduced into parliament the
Territories Law Reform Bill. If passed, the Bill will introduce
reforms to Norfolk Island’s governance arrangements. It also proposes
amendments to Commonwealth administrative laws
to strengthen the accountability
and transparency of the Norfolk Island Government and Administration. In part,
the Bill implements
recommendations of the 2003 report of the Joint Standing
Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, entitled Quis
custodiet ipsos custodes?
: inquiry into governance on Norfolk Island
particular, the report recommended extension to Norfolk Island of the benefits
of a comprehensive system of administrative law,
commensurate with that
available to other Australians.
The proposed amendments will extend to Norfolk Island the application of the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975
Freedom of Information
. In addition, through amendments to
Ombudsman Act 1976
Norfolk Island Act 1979
Commonwealth Ombudsman will become the Ombudsman for Norfolk Island. The
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1995
will not apply to all decisions
made under Norfolk Island enactments: Part 4 of the Bill proposes amendments to
the Act that will
confer on the tribunal merits review jurisdiction for
specified decisions under Norfolk Island legislation. The amendments in the
reform Bill will be supplemented by regulations that will specify which
decisions made under the authority of Norfolk Island law
may be subject to
Administrative Appeals Tribunal merits review. Use of regulations will allow for
staged implementation of the reforms,
to be carried out in consultation with the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Norfolk Island Government and
Administration.
