Complainant AQ v Contracted Service Provider to the Department [2010] VPrivCmr 2 (9 August 2010)
2010 VPrivCmr 2
Complainant AQ v Contracted Service Provider to the Department
[2010] VPrivCmr
Disclosure of personal
information
– whether information was disclosed for purpose other than
primary purpose of collection
– delay by organisation in
providing its privacy policy
_____________________________________________________________________
The Complainant received a fine from the Contracted Service Provider (CSP).
The CSP administered the payments for the fine under
contract by a Department.
The Complainant sent numerous letters to the CSP seeking a document
(“the manual”) held by the CSP, which was relevant
to how the CSP
calculated the fine. In the letter, the Complainant stated “you do not
have my permission to forward this request
to any other party on my
The CSP forwarded the Complainant’s letter to the Department and sent a
standard acknowledgment letter indicating that the Complainant’s
had been referred to the Department.
The Complainant complained to the CSP and also requested a copy of the
CSP’s “privacy code of practice” (the privacy
policy). The
CSP took approximately two months to send a copy of its privacy policy to the
Complainant.
The Complainant made a formal complaint to the Privacy Commissioner under the
Information Privacy Act 2000
(Vic) (the Act).
The CSP responded to the complaint, arguing that it forwarded the letter for
the primary purpose of collection under Information Privacy
Principle (IPP) 2
– being, to fulfil the Complainant’s request for the manual.
Alternatively, the CSP argued that the
disclosure of the Complainant’s
letter to the Department was a related secondary purpose that the Complainant
would have reasonably
expected, given his previous dealings with the CSP. The
CSP also stated that the procedure of forwarding requests for documents
Department was an obligation contained in the contract between the CSP and the
Department.
There were two main aspects to the complaint:
the disclosure of the Complainant’s letter by the CSP to the Department in
relation to a request for documents an unauthorised
disclosure within the
meaning of IPP 2.1?
the allegation that the CSP failed to provide its privacy policy to the
Complainant a breach of IPP 5?
1) Disclosure to the Department
The Privacy Commissioner considered that an organisation can use and disclose
personal information for the primary purpose for which
the information was
collected (IPP 2). In this case, the Complainant made a request to the CSP to
supply the manual. The CSP identified
that it did not hold the manual; instead,
the Department had possession of the document. The CSP then transferred the
Complainant’s
request, and the Complainant’s personal information,
to the Department for the purpose of fulfilling the Complainant’s
There was no other purpose for the transfer, other than fulfilling the request
for the manual. The Commissioner therefore
considered that this disclosure was
the primary purpose of collection of the Complainant’s personal
information.
The Commissioner considered that while the Complainant had requested in the
letter to the CSP that the CSP did not have the Complainant’s
to forward the request to any other party on the Complainant’s behalf,
such permission is not required by the Act.
The Commissioner considered that
failure to follow a direction of an individual will not automatically result in
an interference
with privacy.
Finally, the Privacy Commissioner considered that there was a public interest
in providing access to documents by Government agencies
and transferring
requests for access so they can be fulfilled. The CSP transferred the request
for the manual to the Department.
Guidelines to the Information Privacy
that ‘Government, not the public, need to make the (Act) and
Information
(FOI Act) mesh together’ and that
‘organisations are expected to assist individuals who wish to
access...information.’
The Complainant’s request was analogous to an
FOI Act request; the disclosure of the request, for the purpose of enabling the
Complainant to be provided with access to the document, was in the public
The Commissioner therefore concluded that the CSP, by forwarding a request
for a specific document to the Department, had not interfered
Complainant’s privacy.
2) Provision of the CSP’s Privacy Policy
IPP 5 requires an organisation to set out, in a publicly available document,
clearly expressed policies on its management of personal
information, and to
make the document available to anyone who asks for it.
The Complainant was sent a copy of the CSP’s Privacy Policy after a
delay of approximately two months.
The Commissioner considered, however, that IPP 5 does not contain a
requirement that a policy be provided within a specific time period,
as compared
with other sections of the Act (for example, IPP 6). The CSP explained that the
delay was due to various internal factors
and the numerous letters received from
the Complainant.
The Commissioner considered that, while such a delay was regrettable, the CSP
did eventually provide its privacy policy and had taken
steps to review its
Given that the CSP did in fact supply the privacy policy, and in the absence
of any timeliness requirement in IPP 5, the Commissioner
considered that the CSP
had not interfered with the Complainant’s privacy.
The Complainant did not refer the complaint to the Victorian Civil and
Administrative Tribunal. As a result, the Privacy Commissioner
dismissed the
