(Rule 36.11)
that unless the Court otherwise orders, a judgment or order is taken to be
entered when it is recorded in the Court's computerised
court record system.
Setting aside and variation of judgments or orders is dealt with by
Rules 36.15
. Parties should in particular note the time limit of

On 20 October 2025 this Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal
against a decision of an Acting Deputy President of the Personal
Commission on 2 December 2024 to dismiss the appellant’s appeal against a
Certificate of Determination of the Personal
Injury Commission. During the
hearing of the appeal, the appellant asked for an opportunity to make
submissions as to costs after
we delivered our reasons on the appeal. The
appellant has been given that opportunity, but by email of 27 October 2025
that it did not wish to be heard as to costs. Having read this email,
which was copied to him, the respondent’s solicitor indicated
respondent did not wish to be heard as to costs either.
these circumstances, there is no reason to do anything other than order that
costs follow the event:
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005
order of the Court is:
(1) Appellant to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.
