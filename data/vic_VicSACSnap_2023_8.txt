Sentencing Snapshot 280: Sentencing Trends for Sexual Assault in the
Higher Courts of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of sexual
in the County and Supreme
Courts of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2017-18 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on sexual assault and other offences is available on
A person who intentionally sexually touches another person without the other
person's consent is guilty of the offence of sexual assault.
Sexual assault is
an indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 1,200 penalty
It can be tried summarily in
the Magistrates' Court.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where sexual assault was the principal
offence, that is, cases where sexual assault was the offence
that received the
most severe sentence.
Sexual assault was the principal offence in 1.0% of cases sentenced in the
higher courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 80 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of sexual assault.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
sexual assault by financial year. There were 15 people
sentenced for this
offence in 2021-22, up from 7 in the previous year. The number of people
sentenced was highest in 2019-20 (24
people) and lowest in 2020-21 (7 people).

Figure 2 shows the proportion of people who received
an immediate custodial sentence or non-custodial sentence for the principal
of sexual assault. An immediate custodial sentence involves at least
some element of immediate imprisonment or

period, 48.8% of people were given an immediate custodial sentence. The rate of
immediate custodial sentences
was lowest in 2017-18 (26.7%) and highest in
2018-19 (84.2%).

Over the five-year period, less than half of all people sentenced for sexual
assault as the principal offence received a principal
sentence of imprisonment
(47.5% or 38 of 80 people). The rate of imprisonment sentences was highest in
2018-19 (84.2%) and lowest
in 2017-18 (20.0%). Almost one-third received a
community correction order (31.3% or 25 people).

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the offence of sexual assault from 2017-18 to 2021-22.
The principal sentence describes sentences for the offence at a
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves multiple charges,
the total effective sentence will be either the same as or longer than the
Principal sentences of imprisonment
There were 38 principal sentences of imprisonment
for sexual assault. Table 2 shows that of these, 36 (94.7%) were non-aggregate
imprisonment
terms, that is, the imprisonment terms were not part of an
aggregate sentence, and 2 (5.3%) were aggregate imprisonment
There were 12 people who
received a community correction order in addition to their term of imprisonment

assault for the 36 non-aggregate imprisonment terms. Imprisonment
lengths ranged
from 1 month to 4 years and 6
while the median
imprisonment length was 1 year and 4 months.
The most common range of imprisonment lengths was 1 to less than 2 years (13
principal sentences).

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 38 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for sexual assault, 28
were eligible to have a non-parole period
Of these people, 19 were
given a non-parole period

possible to determine the length of the non-parole period for 1

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for sexual assault face
multiple charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks
the range of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of sexual assault.
Figure 8 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
sexual assault by the total number of sentenced offences
per person. The number
of sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 18, and the median was 2
offences. There were 25 people
(31.2%) sentenced for the single offence of
sexual assault. The average number of offences per person was 3.0.
