Issues Paper 14 (1997) - Review of Sections 409B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)
1. Introduction
History of this Reference (Digest)
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.1 On 2 December 1996, the Attorney-General, the Hon JW Shaw QC, gave the Commission a reference to
review the operation of section 409B of the
Crimes Act 1900
taking into account the purpose for which it was enacted and recent case law.
BACKGROUND TO THE REFERENCE
1.2 Between 1990 and 1995, the District Court of New South Wales granted a permanent stay of proceedings in a number of cases of sexual
assault in which the complainant was a child. This was on the ground that the accused could not receive a fair trial because evidence
he wished to lead was prohibited by s 409B(3), for example:
evidence the complainant had been sexually assaulted in the past;
evidence of allegedly false allegations of sexual assault in the past.
the Court of Criminal Appeal strongly criticised the trial judge’s action in having granted a stay. It held that the court’s
of a valid statutory provision such as s 409B. In rejecting special leave to appeal, the High Court upheld the decision of the Court
of Criminal Appeal. Nevertheless, Chief Justice Brennan, said:
It is the unanimous view of the Court, however, that the provisions of s 409B of the
clearly warrant further consideration by the legislature in the light of the experience of its operation.
1.4 This paper is an issues paper. It is designed to provoke comment. The first section of the paper outlines s 409B, describes how
it works and lists some examples of its operation. It outlines the relevant provisions of the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW), explains why s 409B was enacted and distinguishes it from other Australian laws that restrict the admission of sexual reputation
and experience evidence in sexual assault proceedings. The second section of the paper outlines views about the operation of s 409B.
In the third section, the Commission identifies several options for reform, outlines the arguments for and against the options and
asks questions about what changes, if any, should be made.
WHAT IS SECTION 409B?
An evidentiary provision
1.5 Section 409B is an evidentiary provision that limits the introduction of evidence about a complainant’s sexual reputation
and experience in criminal proceedings. Laws for this purpose were enacted in all Australian jurisdictions in the 1970s and 1980s
to modify the common law rules, under which a complainant (nearly always a woman) in a rape trial could be cross-examined about her
credit and thus her reputation and character where that related to credit. Cross-examination about a complainant’s prior sexual
experience with the accused or with other men was often permitted on this basis. However, this kind of evidence frequently did little
more than embarrass, distress and humiliate complainants and prejudice juries against them rather than in any reasonable sense affect
their credibility. There was a perception that cross-examination which merely humiliated and insulted was permitted far too often.
This was not only unjust to the complainants but discouraged genuine complaints of rape from being brought forward.
What does section 409B say?
Absolutely prohibits reputation evidence
1.6 Section 409B(2) absolutely prohibits evidence of a complainant’s sexual reputation in prescribed sexual offence proceedings.
Limits evidence of sexual experience
1.7 Section 409B(3) severely limits evidence of a complainant’s sexual experience. Evidence of a complainant’s sexual
experience (or lack of it) or his or her sexual activity (or lack of it) cannot be admitted unless two barriers to admission are
the evidence fits within one of the exceptions to the prohibition listed in the section; and
the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant might suffer as a result
if its admission.
1.8 The exceptions to the prohibition are:
evidence of the complainant’s sexual experience or activity (or lack of it) at or about the time of the alleged offence and
alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged offence was committed (s 409B(3)(a));
evidence relating to an existing or recent relationship between the complainant and the accused (s 409B(3)(b));
where the accused denied intercourse took place - evidence relevant to whether the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury
is attributable to the alleged intercourse (s 409B(3)(c));
evidence relevant to whether, at the time of the alleged offence, the complainant had a disease that the accused did not have at any
relevant time or whether, at any relevant time, the complainant did not have a disease that the accused had at the time of the alleged
offence (s 409B(3)(d));
evidence relevant to whether the allegation of the offence was first made after a realisation of pregnancy or disease (s 409B(3)(e));
where the Court is satisfied that the prosecution has disclosed or implied sexual experience or activity (or lack of it) on the part
of the complainant and the accused might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined about it - evidence
given by the complainant in cross-examination (s 409B(3)(f)).
1.9 If the complainant’s sexual experience or activity (or lack of it) has been disclosed or implied by the prosecution, the
accused can cross-examine the complainant if he might otherwise be unfairly prejudiced. Whether or not evidence is admissible under
s 409B(2) or (3) is decided by the judge in the absence of the jury (s 409B(6)). The nature and scope of the evidence that is admissible
and why it is admissible must be recorded in writing (s 409B(7)).
HOW DOES SECTION 409B(3) WORK?
Counsel makes an application
1.10 If counsel wishes to raise evidence under s 409B, he or she must, in theory, make an application to the judge. It should be in
writing. The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that counsel should ensure that there is a proper record of material on which a ruling
on admissibility is sought.
Preferably, a detailed written statement of the evidence proposed to be led or extracted in cross-examination should be handed to
the trial judge and marked for identification. In that way, there should be no room for any later argument in the trial or upon appeal
as to what had been permitted or rejected pursuant to s 409B.
4CHP1_5" href="#fnIP14CHP1_5">
Trial judge decides if evidence is admissible
1.11 If an application to admit sexual experience evidence is made, the trial judge considers it in the absence of the jury. The evidence
must be admissible under the general law before it can be admitted under s 409B, that is, it must be admissible under the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW). It can only be admitted if it fits within one of the exceptions, which, the Court of Criminal Appeal has consistently said,
should be construed broadly.
The Court has held many times that the categories defined by s 409B(3) should be construed broadly when the material in question is
otherwise relevant to the issues of the case.
1.12 If the evidence fits within one of the exceptions, its probative value must outweigh any distress, humiliation or embarrassment
the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. Before the evidence is heard, the trial judge must state the nature and
scope of the evidence and the reasons for admitting it.
Some examples
Cases in which evidence of sexual experience was admissible
1.13 The following cases are examples of cases in which the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the disputed evidence was admissible.
Evidence that the complainant had sexual intercourse with her boyfriend within an hour or two of having allegedly been sexually assaulted
by someone else was admissible as relevant to whether or not the assault took place. It is “properly open to a jury of men
and women to conclude that for her to have such sexual intercourse an hour or two after forced intercourse is, in the relevant sense,
unlikely or contrary to human experience”.
R v Henning
The complainant had been abducted and assaulted by five men. She suffered serious injuries. Evidence that one of the accused had
gone to school with her and had had sexual intercourse with her then and on about 20 occasions since was admissible as relevant to
the complainant’s credibility because she had said she had not seen the accused between leaving school and a month before the
alleged assault.
Evidence that the complainant had had sexual intercourse with her boyfriend six hours before the alleged assault was admissible,
on application by the defence, to explain her distress, dishevelment and injury immediately after the alleged assault.
R v Warner.
The Court of Criminal Appeal overturned the trial judge’s refusal to allow evidence that the complainant had consensual sex
with the accused a month after the alleged assault.
Cases in which evidence of sexual experience was inadmissible
1.14 The following cases are examples of cases in which the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the disputed evidence was not admissible.
Evidence of a conversation at the beach and over coffee shortly before the alleged assault between the complainant and the accused
in which the complainant had discussed the fact that her boyfriend had left her after finding her in bed with a body builder was
not admitted. The Court of Criminal Appeal expressed doubt the complainant could have been cross examined about having had sexual
intercourse with the body builder even under the common law rules.
R v Hunter.
The accused was not permitted to cross-examine the complainant after she had denied having had sexual intercourse at the relevant
time to ascertain whether or not she might have done so: “it was precisely this sort of fishing expedition which s 409B . .
. was designed to prevent”.
R v McGarvey.
Evidence that the accused knew that the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse with 20 other men on an unconnected occasion
and that that had led the accused to believe the complainant was consenting to the alleged assault was not admissible: “That
... is the very sort of evidence which s 409B was designed to exclude”.
R v Costello.
The accused was not permitted to cross-examine the complainant about:
- whether or not she was or had been a prostitute; and
- her alleged participation in group sex 12 months before the alleged assault.
EVIDENCE ACT
RESTRICTIONS
1.15 Section 409B restricts the admissibility of evidence that would otherwise be admissible. In New South Wales, the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) governs admissibility of evidence. Generally speaking, evidence is admissible if it is relevant and does not fit within one
of the exclusionary rules that apply, for example, rules about hearsay evidence, opinion evidence and so on.
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) restricts the admissibility of evidence about a complainant’s sexual reputation and experience.
Evidence relevant to credibility.
Although evidence relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not, generally speaking, admissible,
there are a number of exceptions. One of the exceptions applies to evidence led in cross-examination if it has “substantial
probative value”.
Propensity evidence.
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW), evidence of character, reputation or conduct is not admissible to prove a person has a tendency to act in a particular way
unless sufficient notice is given to the other party and the court thinks that the evidence (by itself or together with other evidence)
would have “significant probative value”.
This is so even if such evidence is admitted for another purpose.
Coincidence evidence.
“Coincidence evidence” is also restricted under the
Evidence Act 1995
Evidence that two or more related events (namely, events that are substantially and relevantly similar and occur in circumstances
that are substantially similar) occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of their occurring coincidentally,
a person did a particular thing or had a particular state of mind unless sufficient notice is given to the other party and the court
thinks that the evidence (by itself or together with other evidence) would have “significant probative value”.
Trial judge has a residual discretion to exclude evidence.
Evidence Act 1995
gives the court a discretion to exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible in certain circumstances. A court may exclude
evidence if “its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:
(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or
(b) be misleading or confusing; or
(c) cause or result in undue waste of time”.
WHY WAS SECTION 409B ENACTED?
Section 409B was part of a package of sexual assault reforms
1.16 Section 409B was one part of a significant package of sexual assault law reforms. The
Crimes (Sexual Assault) Amendment Act 1981
(NSW) included a number of substantive and procedural reforms, including:
the common law offence of rape was abolished and 4 categories of sexual assault were created;
sexual intercourse was defined to include vaginal and anal intercourse, the insertion of parts of the body other than a penis, and
objects, into a vagina or anus, oral sex and the continuation of any one of these;
the immunity from prosecution of husbands and boys under 14 was abolished;
provision for proceedings to be held in camera in some cases;
mandatory warning to the jury that there might be good reasons for delaying or not making a complaint about an assault and that this
does not necessarily show the allegation is false; and
abolition of the rule that the judge should warn the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of
the victim alone.
1.17 The package of reforms was designed:
to protect the victims of rape from victimisation under the legal process; to encourage rape victims to report offences to the authorities;
to facilitate the administration of justice and the conviction of guilty offenders; at the same time, to preserve the rights of the
accused; and to serve an educative function in further changing community attitudes to sexual assault.
Rationale of section 409B
1.18 Section 409B prohibits evidence of a complainant’s sexual reputation and limits the circumstances in which a complainant
might be questioned about his or her sexual experience. Before s 409B became law (and before the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW)), evidence of a woman’s sexual behaviour was regarded as being capable of “relevance”:
Where it established a relevant relationship which was existing at the time of the offence charged... The evidence of other sexual
activity at which the legislation was expressly directed was that which had previously been admitted in relation to issues of the
complainant’s credit, her consent to sexual intercourse and the accused’s belief that she was consenting ... Such evidence
was usually (but not necessarily) of sexual activity beween a female complainant in a rape case and men other than the accused.
1.19 These notions of “relevance” were based on outmoded ideas about women’s sexuality and sexual behaviour. Rape
trials became an ordeal for the complainant who sometimes had to endure cross-examination about intimate details of her sexual life
and was subjected to accusations of immorality.
1.20 In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General said:
The deficiency of the present law is that a victim may be cross-examined about sexual behaviour with other persons, possibly years
before, in circumstances quite irrelevant to the case in question ... The fear of this type of cross-examination has been a potent
cause of reluctance on the part of women to report sexual assault. The old law and practice, therefore, has actually been a cause
of crime. It has discouraged the reporting of crime, and encouraged criminals in the knowledge that they could escape prosecution.
OTHER LAWS RESTRICTING SEXUAL REPUTATION AND EXPERIENCE EVIDENCE
Sexual reputation evidence
1.21 In every Australian jurisdiction, except the Northern Territory, sexual reputation evidence, or “general reputation evidence
as to chastity” is inadmissible. In the Northern Territory, it may be admitted with the leave of the court.
Sexual experience evidence
1.22 In every Australian jurisdiction there are legislative limits on the admissibility of evidence about a complainant’s previous
sexual experience. In Victoria, for example, evidence of the complainant’s “sexual activities” is inadmissible;
in Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, evidence of the complainant’s sexual activities
(or experience) with persons other than the accused is inadmissible. In every jurisdiction except New South Wales, however, evidence
that would otherwise be inadmissible is admissible if the court gives leave. There is a residual discretion in the court to admit
the evidence subject to legislative guidelines:
if it has “substantial relevance to the facts in issue or is a proper matter for cross-examination as to credit”;
if it has “substantial relevance to the facts in issue” and its probative value “outweighs any distress, humiliation
or embarrassment which the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission”;
if refusal to allow the evidence “would prejudice the fair trial of the accused person”.
SECTION 409B(3) DISTINGUISHED
1.23 The approach to restricting sexual experience evidence taken by the New South Wales Parliament is different from that taken by
other Australian Parliaments. Section 409B provides that sexual experience is inadmissible unless it fits within one of the exceptions,
or “gates” to admissibility. There is no residual discretion in the judge to admit evidence that does not fall within
the exceptions. This was a deliberate decision.
The Government has deliberately opted for this course in view of the longstanding practice of the courts to allow wide-ranging and
really irrelevant cross-examination as to prior sexual history.
1.24 In all other Australian jurisdictions (and in England) sexual experience evidence is admissible with leave of the court. In most
other Australian jurisdictions (and in England) the key to admissibility is “relevance”. Formulations of the connection
between the evidence and the issues in the case needed to satisfy the test of relevance include that the evidence must:
be part of the transaction;
render another fact probable;
increase the probability of the existence of the fact, however marginally;
be of sufficient probative value; and
be submitted to a balancing of probative value and other policy considerations.
1.25 In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and in federal courts, evidence is relevant if it is evidence that:
if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact
in issue in the proceeding.
1.26 If its probative value is substantially outweighed by dangers associated with admitting it, the court has a residual discretion
to exclude it.

2. Does Section 409B Work?
History of this Reference (Digest)
INTRODUCTION
2.1 Although there has been considerable criticism of the operation of s 409B, there is conflicting opinion as to its shortcomings
and how they should be overcome. Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal have been highly critical of s 409B because it leaves no
room for the exercise of judicial discretion in cases where its absence apparently led to injustice. The Court has identified a number
of particular problems of interpretation. Two surveys of the operation of s 409B found that the provision has, by and large, achieved
An analysis of cases shows that the provision seems to implement its policy goals in cases in which the issue is consent but that
it has gone beyond this in cases in which the accused denied intercourse took place, especially in cases where the complainant has
allegedly made false allegations of sexual assault on an earlier occasion.
SECTION 409B APPROACH MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE
2.2 The New South Wales Parliament deliberately opted for the s 409B approach to experience evidence, namely, a ban on evidence that
does not fit within one of the exceptions, in favour of the discretionary provisions introduced in other jurisdictions. This approach
has been criticised academically and judicially. Much of the criticism has been directed not at the underlying policy of the provision
but at the way in which the policy was implemented. The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has, in a number of cases, questioned
the wisdom of the Parliament’s assumption that, in framing the section, they could foresee all the possible circumstances in
which an exception to the general rule of exclusion might be appropriate. In
, for example, the Court said:
The legislature has endeavoured to foresee all the exceptions which justice requires and to provide specifically for them. It has
excluded all others. It has taken the risk that experience will throw up circumstances, which it has failed to foresee and expressly
provide for, in which denial of evidence disclosing or implying that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or lack
of sexual experience, or has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, results in injustice to an accused
at his trial. The wisdom of so Draconic a restriction upon judicial discretion and of so bold an assumption of perfect prescience
may be questioned. The courts must apply, however, the law as enacted.
Academic criticism also focusses on the difficulty inherent in identifying in advance all the possible situations that should be excepted
from the general rule. Accepting that there are dangers associated with sexual history evidence and that there are sound policy arguments
for inadmissibility, Stephen Odgers concludes that a general rule of exclusion is inappropriate. Indeed

Do you agree with the s 409B approach or not? What are your reasons for your view?
SECTION 409B RAISES PROBLEMS OF INTERPRETATION
Introduction
2.3 Section 409B has given rise to a number of problems of interpretation:
does sexual “experience” and “activity” include sexual abuse;
does s 409B(5) provide an exclusive test of cross-examination;
what constitutes an existing or recent relationship; and
does “injury” include a child’s broken hymen?
Does sexual experience include sexual abuse?
2.4 In a number of recent cases the evidence that has been held to be inadmissible under s 409B has been evidence of sexual abuse
the complainant had suffered, or claimed to have suffered, before the alleged assault. This is because the earlier assault (or lack
of it) is said to fall within the prohibition on evidence that “discloses or implies that the complainant has or may have had
sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience or has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity”. In
, however, Sperling J, in passing, questioned this assumption:
it is not self evident to me that such sexual abuse or the lack of it is within the ambit of s 409B. The phraseology may be apt to
apply only to prior sexual experience or lack of it which was consensual.
Does section 409B(5) provide an exclusive test of cross-examination?
2.5 Section 409B(5) provides for the accused to cross-examine the complainant if the prosecution has disclosed or implied sexual experience
(or lack of it) or sexual activity (or lack of it) and the accused might otherwise be unfairly prejudiced. In
R v Henning
the Court of Criminal Appeal considered whether s 409B(5) provided the exclusive test of cross-examination and held that it did not;
rather, it is right to assume:
if the cross-examination were permissible at general law, and the case otherwise fell within s 409B(3), then, quite apart from s 409B(5)
it should have been allowed.
What constitutes an existing or recent relationship?
2.6 One of the exceptions to the prohibition on sexual reputation and sexual experience evidence is evidence relating to an existing
or recent relationship between the complainant and the accused. What constitutes a relationship has been discussed in a number of
, the Court of Criminal Appeal favoured the narrower definition of the word in dictionaries: “an emotional connection between
people, sometimes involving sexual relations”.
R v Henning
, however, the Court downplayed the importance of the emotional connection:
we do not consider in the circumstances that the emotional aspect is as important as the sexual one. We are, after all, considering
the matter in the context of an alleged sexual assault.
2.7 This was taken further in
R v Beserick
in which the Court held that evidence of sexual activity, other than that charged, between a complainant child and the accused is
admissible as evidence of an existing or recent relationship in order to establish the accused’s guilty passion at the time
of the offence.
Does s 409B raise any other problems of interpretation and, if so, how have they been resolved?
SECTION 409B HAS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED POLICY
2.8 There is general consensus that the underlying policy of s 409B, namely that complainants in sexual assault proceedings should
be protected from irrelevant and offensive questions about their sexual lives, is sound. Despite the problems identified in the paragraphs
above, s 409B has, by and large, implemented this policy successfully. There have been two surveys of the operation of s 409B.
Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research.
In 1987, the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research published a report of its study, over an 18 month period (from 14 July 1981
to 13 January 1983), of transcripts of all sexual assault categories 1 to 3 proceedings.
Heroines of Fortitude.
In November 1996, the New South Wales Department of Women published
Heroines of Fortitude: the experiences of women in court as victims of sexual assault
. It reported a study, the objective of which was to examine the effectiveness of the 1981 reforms, of all sound recorded sexual assault
proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales from 1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995.
2.9 The Bureau of Crime Statistics reported a significant reduction in the number of cases in which the complainant’s sexual
experience was raised and some difference in the kind of sexual experience admitted. At committal hearings, the number of cases in
which the complainant’s prior sexual experience was raised fell by almost half, from 65.7% to 33.2% of cases. In higher court
proceedings, there was also a decline in the number of cases in which the complainant’s sexual experience was raised, from
68% to 40.6% of cases. In addition, where sexual experience was raised at committal, the complainant was asked fewer questions than
There was also a qualitative difference in the kind of prior sexual experience that was admitted at committal hearings and in higher
courts. The researchers for
Heroines of Fortitude
concluded that the position of a complainant giving evidence in sexual assault cases has remained fairly constant since the earlier
Do you think that s 409B has successfully implemented the policy underlying the legislation?
CASES WHERE THE ISSUE IS CONSENT
2.10 An analysis of cases which reached the Court of Criminal Appeal in which consent (or belief in consent) is the issue shows that
s 409B appears to be achieving its goals. Section 409B provides for two exceptions to the general exclusion of sexual history evidence
in cases where consent is the issue. Evidence may be admitted if it is evidence of:
sexual activity on the part of the complainant that is part of a connected set of circumstances with the alleged offence (s 409B(3)(a));
an existing or recent relationship between the accused person and the complainant (s 409B(3)(b)).
2.11 An examination of cases which reached the Court of Criminal Appeal in which consent was the issue does not support the argument
that the section is unduly restrictive, although the issues arising both in trials and on appeal do not necessarily reflect what
counsel for an accused person may not have raised because of the existence of s409B. In all of the cases in which a ground of appeal
that evidence of prior sexual activity was not admitted when it should have been was successful, the evidence the accused wished
to raise was evidence of previous sexual activity with people other than the accused. The evidence that was not admitted was evidence
usually of this kind:
the complainant’s alleged past prostitution;
the accused’s belief that the complainant had consented to intercourse with 20 men on another unconnected occasion;
the complainant having told the accused that her former boyfriend had broken off their relationship because he had found her in bed
with a body builder.
2.12 It appears that the evidence that would have been led in three of these cases would have been indistinguishable from reputation
evidence which is prohibited absolutely. The evidence, if led, would have been relevant to consent only on the assumption that, having
consented to sexual intercourse with someone else on another occasion, the complainant was likely to have consented on this one.
This assumption about consent was what s 409B was seeking to eradicate. In the last case, it is not clear whether the defence case
rested on the assumption that having sex with a body builder shows a propensity for having sex with everyone or whether the complainant’s
having casual sex with someone else while in a relationship went to her credit. In any case, the Court of Criminal Appeal doubted
whether the complainant could have been cross-examined about her intercourse with the body builder even under the common law rules.
In none of the cases does it appear that an injustice has been done to the accused as a result of the exclusion of the evidence made
inadmissible by s 409B.
Do you know of any cases in which consent (or belief in consent) was the issue where s 409B successfully achieved its policy goals?
Do you know of any cases in which consent (or belief in consent) was the issue where s 409B resulted in injustice?
CASES WHERE INTERCOURSE IS DENIED
2.13 Section 409B has come under attack in a number of cases in which intercourse was denied. For example, the section has prevented
the accused from raising evidence of the complainant’s allegedly false claims of sexual assault in the past. In
the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the trial judge’s decision that evidence of the complainant’s earlier allegations
that members of her family had sexually assaulted her was not admissible even though the forensic purpose of the proposed evidence
was to establish the complainant’s lack of truthfulness, not her sexual experience or activity (or lack of it) which would
have been revealed only consequentially.
was applied in
R v Bernthaler
in which the Court held that evidence of an adult complainant’s allegedly false claims of sexual assault as a child was not
admissible, “unfortunate though it may be for particular accused persons in particular cases”.
Both cases were quoted with approval in
in which the defence identified a number of ways s 409B would operate unreasonably and unfairly preventing evidence on collateral
matters which may be of importance.
It would prevent an accused from showing a complainant was a compulsive false accuser of sexual misconduct on the part of others.
It would prevent the accused from advancing a case that the complainant has made a false complaint in order to divert attention from
some other illegal conduct involving sexual activity, such as incest. It would prevent furtherance of a case that the complainant
was subject to sexual fantasy arising from an earlier repressed sexual experience.
Do you know of any cases in which intercourse was denied where s 409B successfully achieved its policy goals?
Do you know of any cases in which intercourse was denied where s 409B resulted in injustice?

3. Options for Reform
History of this Reference (Digest)
OPTIONS FOR REFORM - SEXUAL EXPERIENCE EVIDENCE
Introduction
3.1 Assessments of s 409B(3) vary. On the one hand, it has been criticised on the grounds of injustice and uncertainty. On the other,
it is fair to regard it as a generally successful attempt to implement an important policy goal. There is general agreement that
there needs to be some restriction on the admissibility of sexual experience evidence and that is it not appropriate to revert to
the practice that existed before s 409B was passed. In this section of the paper, the Commission outlines several approaches to dealing
with evidence of a sexual assault complainant’s past sexual experience:
retain the restrictive approach of s 409B (that is, a blanket exclusion with specific exceptions) and either amend the current exceptions
to overcome identified problems or formulate a new list of exceptions; or
repeal s 409B and replace it with a provision that would make sexual experience evidence inadmissible but would give the judge a discretion
to admit, or reject, the evidence; or
repeal s 409B and rely on the protection for the complainant afforded by the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) with or without a rider that would give the trial judge an added discretion to exclude evidence in sexual assault cases.
Option outlined
3.2 The approach of s 409B would be retained. There would be a prohibition on sexual experience evidence unless it fitted into one
of the exceptions outlined in the section. This would be achieved by amending s 409B to overcome the problems identified in paragraph
2.3. Alternatively, the exceptions would be reformulated.
Arguments in favour of option 1
3.3 The s 409B approach was a deliberate decision on the part of the New South Wales legislature.
It seems to be more successful in restricting the admission of sexual experience evidence than the discretionary approach in other
Australian jurisdictions. In their analysis of the Bureau of Crime Statistics research mentioned at paragraph 2.7, L’Orange
and Egger concluded:
In general, it appears that the legislative specification of evidentiary “gates” has been more successful than the provision
of a general judicial discretion.
3.4 In Victoria, for example, a recent study by the Rape Law Reform Evaluation Project showed that sexual experience evidence is still
admitted in a significant number of committal and trial proceedings in Victoria.
In removing from judges a discretion concerning the relevance of a complainant’s sexual experience, s 409B removes the possibility
that some such decisions might be based on outmoded views. It gives a high level of protection for sexual assault complainants and
ensures they are not unnecessarily victimised in the court process.
Arguments against option 1
3.5 Experience has shown that the existing exceptions are not comprehensive enough. For example, the Court of Criminal Appeal has
consistently held that s 409B prohibits cross-examination of a complainant about allegedly false complaints of sexual assault. It
inevitably will be difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a list of exceptions that include all the circumstances in which it
might be appropriate to admit sexual experience evidence. This may unduly restrict an accused person’s defence and lead to
injustice in a particular case. In Canada, a provision that took a similar approach to that of s 409B was held to be unconstitutional
in that it offended Canada’s Charter of Freedoms and Rights.
Should the s 409B approach be retained, that is, should evidence of a complainant’s sexual experience be inadmissible in a sexual
assault case unless it fits into specific categories? Why or why not?
Should s 409B(3) of the
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) be retained and amended to overcome specific problems identified by critics? If not, why not? If so, how should it be amended?
Should the exceptions to the prohibition on sexual experience evidence in s 409B(3) of the
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) be reformulated? If so, what should the exceptions be?
Option outlined
3.6 Section 409B would be repealed. It would be replaced by a provision that would prohibit the admission of sexual experience evidence,
except with the leave of the trial judge, as exists in other Australian jurisdictions. There may be limitations imposed on the exercise
of the judge’s discretion over and above those imposed by the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW). For example, the section could provide that the discretion may be exercised only if:
the evidence has “substantial relevance” to the facts in issue, and
its probative value outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant might suffer if it is admitted.
Arguments on favour of option 2
3.7 Provisions that give the trial judge a discretion to admit sexual experience evidence exist in all other Australian States and
Territories. The Court of Criminal Appeal recommended a discretionary provision in
R v Bernthaler
A Tasmanian study of transcripts of committal, trial and sentencing proceedings for major sexual offences over a period beginning
three years before Tasmania’s sexual assault law reforms were enacted in 1987 and ending in 1994 was generally positive about
the effectiveness of s 102A
Evidence Act 1910
(Tas) in achieving its legislative goals. A discretionary provision would ensure that evidence that is highly relevant is not excluded
merely because it did not fit within a pre-ordained exception. It would weigh the scales in favour of the accused which, in a criminal
trial that may have very serious consequences for the accused, is appropriate. The trial judge has a general responsibility to ensure
that a trial is fair and, as a matter of principle, he or she ought to have a general discretion to admit sexual history evidence
in appropriate cases.
Arguments against option 2
3.8 The main argument against a discretionary provision is that “relevance” may not be an objective enough criterion for
deciding whether or not to admit sexual experience evidence.
Whatever the test, be it one of experience, common sense or logic ... It is a decision particularly vulnerable to the application
of private beliefs. Regardless of the definition used, the content of any relevancy decisions will be filled by the particular judge’s
experience, common sense and/or logic.
3.9 “Relevance” has sometimes been informed by some traditional views of women’s sexuality that bear little resemblance
to modern reality. Judgments that are affected by myths and stereotypes will led to unjust results.
Should s 409B(3) be replaced by a provision that makes sexual experience evidence inadmissible but gives the trial judge a discretion
to admit it? Why or why not?
If s 409B(3) is replaced by a discretionary provision, what limitations should be placed on the exercise of the discretion? In what
circumstances should the judge be able to admit sexual experience evidence?
Option outlined
3.10 Section 409B(3) would be repealed. There would be no legislation dealing specifically with the admissibility of evidence of the
complainant’s sexual experience in sexual assault proceedings in New South Wales. Instead, the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) would apply.
Two alternative approaches could be adopted under option 3. The first would be to rely on the existing
Evidence Act
provision. The second would involve an amendment to the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) to add to the relevant provisions the rider that, in deciding whether or not to admit evidence of the complainant’s sexual
experience in sexual assault proceedings, the trial judge would be obliged to consider whether the probative value of the evidence
outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant might suffer if it is admitted.
Arguments in favour of option 3
3.11 The provisions of the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW), in particular, the cross-examination exception to the credibility rule, the tendency rule, the coincidence rule and the general
discretion to exclude evidence, represent an appropriate balance between the rights of a complainant in sexual assault proceedings
to have his or her privacy and dignity respected and the right of an accused to a fair trial.
Arguments against option 3
3.12 Despite the criticism that has been levelled at s 409B(3), it has not been suggested that there should not be a specific law
restricting the admissibility of sexual experience evidence. In
for example, the Court of Criminal Appeal agreed, that, despite the problems with s 409B, there was a need for protective legislation.
There is (and has been for many years) legislation of this kind in every jurisdiction in Australia.
Should the admissibility of evidence of the complainant’s sexual experience in sexual assault proceedings be governed by the
provisions of the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) and not by specific legislation?
If so, should the relevant provisions of the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) be amended to add the rider that, in deciding whether or not to admit evidence of the complainant’s sexual experience
in sexual assault proceedings, the trial judge would be obliged to consider whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs
any distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant might suffer if it is admitted?
OPTIONS FOR REFORM - SEXUAL REPUTATION EVIDENCE
3.13 At common law, sexual reputation was sometimes admissible as relevant to the complainant’s credit and, very rarely, to
the issue of belief in consent. Under the
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW), evidence relevant only to credibility is generally inadmissible but may be led in cross-examination if it has “substantial
probative value”. Propensity evidence, or evidence of, among other things, reputation, is not admissible to prove that a person
has a tendency to act in a particular way unless notice is given and it has “significant probative value”, in which case
the judge may admit it. Section 409B(2), on the other hand, absolutely prohibits evidence of a complainant’s sexual reputation.
The issue is: should the blanket ban on sexual reputation evidence be retained?
Arguments for retaining the ban on reputation evidence
3.14 There are provisions similar to s 409B(2) in most other Australian jurisdictions, and the Model Criminal Code Committee has adopted
a similar provision.
Debate on s 409B has focussed on s 409B(3) and there have been no calls for the repeal of s 409B(2). There is no suggestion that
evidence of a complainant’s sexual reputation should be regarded as being relevant to his or her credibility. It was clearly
the purpose of the legislature in enacting s 409B that persons accused of sexual assault should not be able to assume consent on
the basis of the complainant’s sexual reputation.
a person who seeks sexual intercourse with another should not be able to rely on scandal or gossip about the other person or on rumour
or knowledge of that other person’s sexual behaviour with others, as a basis for assuming consent to intercourse.
3.15 In principle, there seems no reason why they should. An accused should not be able to assume that a person consents to intercourse
with him because he or she has consented to intercourse with another person in the past. The principle remains true even if the intercourse
had been as a prostitute, or with a number of people, or outside an existing relationship with another person.
Arguments against retaining the ban on reputation evidence
Evidence Act 1995
(NSW) gives a complainant enough protection against attack on his or her credibility on the basis of reputation.
There should continue to be an absolute ban on the admission of evidence of a complainant’s sexual reputation. Do you agree?
If so, why? If not, why not?
