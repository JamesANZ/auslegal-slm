Fees charge on referral of matters to
Administrative Appeals Tribunal
Revenue Ruling GEN.002
The tax legislation administered by the State
Revenue Office generally allows a person who is
dissatisfied with a decision on an objection to refer
the matter for hearing at the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (AAT).
Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Fees)
Regulations 1993
(the AAT Regulations) prescribed
by the Department of Justice introduced a fee ($150
as at 1 January 1994) to be charged in respect to
the Commissioner for referral of a matter to the AAT,
on or after 1 January 1994, was to be accompanied
by payment of the prescribed fee. This requirement
applies to the following legislation administered by
the State Revenue Office:
� Stamps Act 1958
� Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
� Financial Institutions Duty Act 1982
� Land Tax Act 1958
• Business Franchises legislation
� Debits Tax Act 1990
� Energy Consumption Levy Act 1982
Taxpayers and practitioners are advised that an
anomaly in the AAT regulations was discovered by
the State Revenue Office and drawn to the attention
of the Victorian Department of Justice. The purpose
of this ruling is to state the position which will be
adopted pending the correction of that anomaly.
The State Revenue Office will not seek to collect the
fee prescribed under the AAT Regulations until the
anomaly is rectified by amendment. This Office will
advise taxpayers and practitioners as to the date
from which it will commence to collect the fee.
Consistent with this ruling, the State Revenue Office
has been advised that the Registrar of the AAT will
also not enforce payment of the fee until the
necessary amendments are made to facilitate the
collection of the fee.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
