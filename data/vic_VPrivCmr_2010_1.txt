Background information
The Complainant was an employee of a Victorian Public
Sector organisation and was required to handle telephone enquiries from the
public which were often recorded by the employer. The Complainant received a
call from a member of the public who clearly identified
himself throughout the
conversation. The caller was extremely abusive towards the Complainant and made
threats against members of
Organisation B.
As a result, a senior member of the employer organisation sent an email to a
senior member of Organisation B notifying Organisation
B of the threats. The
email included personal information about the member of the public as well as an
electronic audio file containing
the recording of the telephone call handled by
the Complainant. The electronic audio file was labelled with a misspelled
of the Complainant’s name.
Subsequently, the Complainant’s employer became aware that the email
and electronic audio file were circulating in the public
domain and that the
recorded call had been placed on YouTube and another website with links through
Google. The Complainant’s
employer, whose staff member had sent the email
to Organisation B for the purpose of notifying it of the threats, made a
to Organisation B about the unauthorised disclosure of the email and
electronic audio file.
The employer took steps to have the electronic audio file removed from the
internet, however it was subsequently re-uploaded.
The Complainant made a complaint to his employer about unauthorised
disclosure of his personal information and breach of data security.
Complainant also alleged that his employer had failed to provide him with a copy
of its privacy policy on request. The Complainant
was dissatisfied with how the
complaint was handled by the employer and subsequently made a formal complaint
to the Office of the
Victorian Privacy Commissioner about the employer.
Audit information provided by the employer in response to the privacy
complaint indicated that it was likely that the unauthorised
disclosure of
personal information had occurred through the actions of Organisation B.
Consequently, the Complainant lodged a separate
complaint about Organisation B.
This case note focuses on the complaint about Organisation B.
The initial response from Organisation B
In its initial response, Organisation B sought to
have the complaint declined for the following reasons:
had not had adequate opportunity to deal with the matter (Section 29(1)(h)(ii)
Information Privacy Act 2000
(Vic) (‘IPA’));
it was taking disciplinary action under another Act against its staff for the
unauthorised disclosure, the complaint should be
declined on the basis that the
act or practice complained about could be made the subject of an application
under another Act and
it was being adequately dealt with under that Act (Section
29(1)(f)); and
the relevant provision of the Act was inconsistent with the IPA
to Section 6 of the IPA, the IPA did not apply to the complaint.
The Privacy Commissioner’s response
The Commissioner rejected Organisation B’s
arguments for the following reasons:
Organisation B had been aware of the complaint for 18 months, it could not be
said that it had not had an adequate opportunity
to deal with the complaint;
Investigating
the actions of its staff under another Act did not mean that the subject matter
of the complaint was being adequately
dealt with under the other Act because
that Act provided no means of redress for loss or damage suffered by the
Complainant due to
the interference with privacy; and
other Act was not inconsistent with the IPA because it provided for action to be
taken against individual staff of Organisation
B who may have breached secrecy
provisions. The IPA places obligations on organisations and provides redress
for individuals where
an organisation fails to comply with its obligations.
Subsequent response from Organisation B
In a subsequent response, Organisation B provided
advice that its email audit had revealed that the electronic audio recording had
been accessed in excess of 2000 times by Organisation B employees for
entertainment purposes. It established that an employee of
Organisation B was
not responsible for the actual upload of the file to YouTube. However, given
that the email had been circulated
so widely amongst employees of Organisation B
for entertainment purposes that were completely unrelated to the primary purpose
collection, Organisation B acknowledged that this “may have
contributed” to the disclosure on YouTube.
The information provided by the employer organisation
and Organisation B revealed that the original email to Organisation B containing
the electronic audio file had been circulated widely within Organisation B. The
Commissioner’s view was, therefore, that this
had exposed the
Complainant’s personal information to the risk of unauthorised disclosure.
It was not determined who was responsible
for releasing the email to the public.
However, from the evidence provided by the Complainant’s employer and
Organisation B, it appeared that the senior member of
the employer organisation
had only sent the email with the audio file to the senior member of Organisation
B. Therefore, it was
highly probable that one or more of the 2000 or so
employees of Organisation B who had received the email had sent the email
of Organisation B and into the public domain. Consequently, the
Commissioner did not consider that there were any grounds to exercise
discretion to decline the complaint against Organisation B and determined to
refer it to conciliation.
Conciliation with Organisation B failed.
The Complainant required the Commissioner to refer the complaint to the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal and agreement
was reached at a
compulsory conference with the Complainant and both Organisation B and the
