& Baker (Tenants)
APPLICATION
: Compensation for loss
APPEARANCES
: Anthony Cavallaro, property manager for
the landlord;
The tenant in person.
: 31 October
2001 at Sydney
On 7 February 2002 the Tribunal made the following orders for the payment of
money which the Tribunal finds to be due and owing.
1. The sum of
$3,047.50 is owing on the basis of the landlord’s terms of losses as set
out in the parties negotiations (see
findings below).
The tenants, Mr
and Mrs Baker are to pay the landlord, Ms Knight, C/- The Bickmore Hutt Agency,
194 Avoca Street, RANDWICK NSW 2031
the sum of $3,047.50 on or before
2. The Rental Bond Services is directed to pay the landlord,
Ms Knight, C/- The Bickmore Hutt Agency, 194 Avoca Street, RANDWICK
the whole bond plus interest of rental bond number 82005594. Any amount
received is to be credited against the money order.
REASONS FOR DECISION
The letter from the landlord’s
agent of 18 July 2001 was a conditional offer to release the tenants on certain
conditions ie
prior consent before vacating (refer section 53(g) of the
It was not accepted by the tenants
therefore section 53(g) does not apply (see eg.
Spottiswood
RTT97/24469).
Thus the tenants "abandoned" the premises
on 26 July 2001 (section 53(f)), and the tenants were potentially liable for
the end of the fixed term, insufficient grounds having been found for
the notice of termination dated 12 July 2001 (by the orders
of 15 August 2001).
That liability was subject to appropriate mitigation by the landlords of their
loss. (section 78(2)).
However, the offer of 23 August 2001 was
then made on behalf of the landlords, clearly in consideration of, amongst other
early release of the bond.
By letter in reply dated 29 August 2001,
the tenants accepted that offer, apparently also after some phone conversations
landlord’s agent. (ie some 6 days later).
The landlords then by letter dated 30
August 201 abrogated that agreement, and substituted a new figure for the rent
component (ie.
5 weeks rent @ $650.00 per week, totalling now $3,250.00, and not
the previous figure, stated as 5 weeks rent at $650.00 per week,
$2,600.00).
The Tribunal has perused and noted the
parties submissions, and has come to a different view from the preliminary view
outlined as
a possibility at the hearing, having also perused Chapters 3 and 12
Cheshire and Fifoot, Law of Contract
On the basis of the above outline of the
facts, the Tribunal concludes that there was a "unilateral" mistake by the
landlords in their
initial letter of 23 August 2001, which has not been proved
to be a mutual mistake (ie. in the minds of the tenants when they accepted
offer). The Tribunal concludes this after considering all the evidence,
including that the "mistake’ was still not corrected
in the second (lower)
group of figures, in the letter of 30 August 2001, and that, say, 4 weeks rent
($2,600) may well have been
offered, and the "mistake", in the tenants’
minds, could equally be that.
Finally, having sighted the advertisement
in the Herald for 28-29 July 2001, for $650.00, the Tribunal is satisfied that
the landlords
mitigated their loss appropriately. It is indeed arguable that,
notice having been given on 12 July 2001, an advertisement should
inserted for the weekend of 21-22 July 2001, but in all the circumstances, that
has not been considered as a failure to
mitigate by the landlords (who otherwise
very properly mitigated the potential losses).
Thus, the Tribunal finds, either on the
basis of contractual law, or on grounds based on promissory estoppel, that the
tenants are
liable to the landlord for compensation in the sum of
