Cleburne v. Meredith [1843] TASSupC 49 (12 December 1843)
Cleburne v. Meredith [1843]
insolvency - trover - farm tenancies
Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land
Montagu J., 12 December 1843
Hobart Town Advertiser
, 19 December 1843
His Honor Mr. Justice Montagu took his seat this morning, at ten o'clock. The following Esquire's were sworn on
the jury:- J. G. Jennings, foreman; J. Davis, R. S. Stewarts, and Sloane.
Cleburne (assignee) v Meredith
The Solicitor General and Mr. Macdowell appeared as Counsel for the plaintiff; attorneys, Messrs. Allport and Roberts. Counsel for
the defendant Mr. Montagu; attorney Mr. Crombie.
Mr. Macdowell opened the pleadings. The action was one of trover, brought by Mr. Richard Cleburne, assignee of the estate
of Edward Tilley; against George Meredith, Esq., of Swan Port, for the recovery of Â£380, the value of a flock of sheep,
and a number of bullocks, &c. The defendant pleaded, first, the general issue; and secondly that the plaintiff was not lawfully
possessed of the property claimed, in his capacity of assignee.
The Solicitor-General, in his opening address, gave an outline of the plaintiff's case, and the evidence that he should
produce. He intimated the probability that it might eventually turn upon a question for the Court, rather than for the decision of
Edward Tilley
(examined by Mr. Macdowell) I know Mr. Meredith; I first occupied a farm of his, as sub-tenant under Mr. Watson. In March, 1840,
I became tenant to Mr. Meredith, on the same farm. The farm consisted of about 5,000 acres; 2,000 sheep; and 36 working bullocks.
In March, 1840, I was to pay about Â£1,300 a-year rent; Watson's tenancy, I understood, was for seven years; two
years had expired when I became full tenant, so that I was to have it for five years, from Mr. Meredith. I occupied the farm one
year and three-quarters. On the 28th January, 1842, I was declared insolvent. When I entered on the farm I had about 2,000 sheep
from Mr. Meredith; when declared insolvent, I had with the increase of the flock, about 2,700 - The custom was to take the old sheep
out from the flock and replace them with young ones; I cannot tell, at the time I was insolvent, how many was left of the original
flock. I was to return Mr. Meredith the same number of sheep at the end of my rental, of about the same quality. I was to return
the same number of bullocks, or pay for them; I might replace them. The estate I rented consisted of several farms; there was also
a run on adjoining government land. John Barber, my son-in-law, had a thousand sheep on an adjoining run, of those I received from
Mr. Meredith. I was to have 50 per cent for them; 500 lambs, with the wool. The rest of the sheep were on the estate I rented. I
sold 300 sheep, of these I had from Mr. George Meredith to Mr. Charles Meredith; consisting of 200 young ewes, and 100 young wedders.
I got paid for them. Mr. Charles Meredith , at the time he purchased the sheep, was residing at Rivers-dale, about four miles from
Mr. Meredith. I got the increase from two flocks of sheep, my son's and Dagg's; from these I kept up my son-in-law (Barber's)
flock of 1,000 from which we used to draw for the use of the establishment. The sale was on the 21st of January; 100 odd sheep, 2
horses, 16 or 17 pigs, and 42 head of poultry. The document handed to me I gave to Mr. Roberts some time ago; I got it from Mr. Meredith,
and signed it. When I signed it, I was at Charles Meredith's. The document was ready drawn up, except an addition at the bottom.
I refused to sign it, unless it was stated that my assignee consented.
The document dated 2nd February, 1842 was put in and read; it was an assignment of the land and stock, of which Tilley
was in possession, and previously occupied by Watson, to Meredith. [This document, throughout the entire trial, and in his address
to the jury, was characterised by the learned Judge as a mere piece of waste paper, Tilley not having power to assign.]
Cross-examined by Mr. Montagu. - I was for a long time servant to Mr. Meredith; and first became his tenant in March,
1840. I was to keep up the stock on the different farms; the agreement was to be for five years, from year to year. I was not owner
of the 2000 sheep received from Mr. Meredith; but only of the excess above the number received. The original stock I considered belonged
to the landlord; I could not have sold without his consent.
Mr. Macdowell said he should put it, at the proper time, Mr. Meredith's examination before Mr. Fleming, commissioner,
during the progress of Tilney's insolvency.
Examination continued. - I had an undertaking that I was always to keep up the flock of 2000. I do not know that there
was any express undertaking between us about the sale of stock, but I never should have sold, without asking permission. When I became
tenant, there had been a dispute between Watson and Meredith about the sale of some stock; Watson was, like myself, a mere tenant.
The original sheep, and the surplus ones were, on the first part of the tenancy, branded differently; at the time of insolvency they
had all one brand; Mr. Meredith's. I do not know whether I ever told Charles Meredith that I had my landlord's consent to
sell the 300 sheep. But I might; the bailiffs were in possession of all the property; the distress was by the landlord. This was
at the time of my insolvency.
By the Solicitor General. - I do not know that I could have sold 1000 sheep out of the original flock, and replace them
by another 1000, because Mr. Meredith used to select the rams to go amongst the flock. The sheep my son in law and Dogg's had
were marked T, the flock my younger son had were marked O; neither of the brands belonged to Mr. Meredith. The 200 sheep were not
sold under distress, only the surplus. The 2000 remained on the land; they were not sold. They remained unsold at the time of signing
the document. The excess above the 2000 was sold, under the distress put in by Mr. Meredith.
Valentine Fleming, Esq., took the examination of Mr. Meredith, in the progress of Tilley's insolvency; that was on
the 16th June, 1842. Various exhibits were put in by Mr. Meredith, and referred to during the course of examination. The examination
contains the substance, and in many parts the very words, as they were uttered from the lips of the speaker.
John Barber. - Had 1,000 sheep, which I gave up to Mr. Meredith last year. I first took the 1,000 sheep from Mr. Meredith.
I had no arrangement with Watson respecting them. The terms were that I was to give Mr. Meredith 500 lambs yearly. When Watson took
the place I gave the lambs to him; when Tilley became tenant he got the lambs. I had no arrangement with Tilley different from Meredith;
he was to have the lambs at 7s. 6d. per head. When I heard of Tilley's insolvency I had about 900 or 1,000 ewes, and 8 or 900
lambs. I do not remember whether, at the time of the insolvency, I had given Tilley the lambs.
By the Judge. - I had given them over in January, 1842; but I do not know whether to Tilley or Meredith. I think young
Meredith took them from me. About that time I gave up the sheep to Mr. Meredith. The sheep and lambs were never taken from me during
the time I had them. I was afterwards made bailiff by Mr. Meredith.
By the Judge. - I do not know whether I had then given up the lambs.
Examination continued. When I heard that things were settled between Tilley and Meredith I gave up the appointment of bailiff.
By Mr. Montagu. - I was bailiff in possession of Tilley's property at the time the distress took place.
Mr. Montagu submitted that there was no case for the jury on three grounds; first, that there was no proof of express demand and refusal;
second, the plaintiff has wholly failed to prove any possession of the property by the insolvent at the time of the insolvency; third,
the possession of the stock in Meredith was proved by the effect of the distress. On these grounds the plaintiff should be non-suited.
The Solicitor General contested that the defendants own act, in getting the insolvent to assign the land and stock, proved that possession
was not in him; that the property in the sheep was actually parted with at the time of the agreement, for at the end of five years
there might not be left ten sheep of the original flock; that the possession in Tinney was by continuation from Barker; there was
no charge in the right.
The Judge observed that, as to the assignment of the property, the document was utterly valueless.
The Judge observed that, as to the assignment of the property, the document was utterly valueless in law; it should have been made
clear that, at some particular time there was an act of insolvency; and the plaintiff was not entitled to possession at law. His
Honor then directed the plaintiff to be called.
The Solicitor General preferred that the case should go to the jury.
His Honor then pointed out the questions, upon the evidence, for their consideration, which the foreman committed in writing.
After a short time they returned a verdict for the defendant; but upon the questions submitted by his Honor, said:-
"We think that the control and ownership of the sheep was in the tenant during the lease; and we are of opinion that if this
demand hade been made by the assignee at an earlier time, he would have had some ground for the action; and we agree with the Solicitor
General, who admitted that the tenancy expired with the insolvency.
