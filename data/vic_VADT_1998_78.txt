Lovejoy v Myer Stores Limited [1998] VADT 78 (30 June 1998)
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION TRIBUNAL
No. 33 of 1994
Adam Acintya Lovejoy
COMPLAINANT
Myer Stores Limited
FIRST NAMED RESPONDENT
Stephen Part
SECOND NAMED RESPONDENT
REASONS FOR DECISION ON THE HEARING OF THE COMPLAINT
30 June 1998
Mrs Anne Coghlan -
Deputy President
Dr Julie Dawson -
Mr Daniel Rechtman -
This matter has a very long history. It arises out of complaints made by Adam
Acintya Lovejoy (Mr Lovejoy) against Mr Stephen Part,
a regional manager with
Myer and against Myer Stores Limited.
On 19 December 1994, the Equal Opportunity Commission ("the Commission"),
pursuant to Section 45 (5) of the
Equal Opportunity Act
1994 ("the Act")
referred the complaints of Mr Lovejoy against Myer Stores Limited and Mr Stephen
Part to the Equal Opportunity Board
("the Board"). By letter dated 10 November
1994, Mr Lovejoy had asked the Commission to refer his complaint to the
The complaint documentation attached to the Commission's letter of referral
included a complaint form dated 5 October 1993 and a letter
(with attached
documentation) from Mr Lovejoy dated 26 January 1994. In his complaint, Mr
Lovejoy claimed discrimination in the provision
of goods and services on the
ground of his sex, lawful political or religious belief, or imputed impairment.
He also claimed that
he was victimised by the respondents.
Following some preliminary procedures about particulars and clarification
that the proper name of the first respondent was Myer Stores
Limited, an
application was made pursuant to Section 44C of the Act by Myer Stores Limited,
the first named respondent and Stephen
Part, the second named respondent ("the
respondents") for the application to be struck out, on the grounds that the
complaint was
frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance.
That application commenced to be heard on 1 September 1995 and was adjourned
to 23 February 1996.
It is convenient here to set out the summary of Mr Lovejoy's complaints as
they appear in the Board's reasons for decision delivered
on 10 April 1996.
The Complainant claims that from May to mid December 1993 he was
harassed, assaulted and victimised by the first respondent and its
employees. He
claims that, during that period, he was forcibly ejected by those employees from
Myer Stores in Melbourne and was prevented
from entering those stores. He claims
that he was the holder of a valid Myer card but that Myer stores refused to sell
goods to him
and to make available to him the services offered to other people
with a valid Myer card. He claims that Mr Bernie Elliott, Myer
Operations Manager, said to him 'you are a schizophrenic not a lawyer. We can do
anything we like to you and there is nothing
you can do about it.'
He claims that, he has been victimised and become a social outcast because
of reports in the media relating to two matters. The first
matter concerns
comments made about his paranoid schizophrenia in the course of a Supreme Court
Case. The second matter concerns
the allegation contained in an article in the
Truth newspaper of 31 August 1985. The headline of the Article read 'Melbourne
Man-3 Wives and a Harem', and goes on to make certain claims about the
Complainant's life when a leader of the Hari Krishna sect.
The Complainant also
asserts that he several times complained to Mr Part (Myer's Regional Manager)
that the abuse and harassment continued.
The Board concluded as follows:-
We conclude that this complaint invokes the Board's jurisdiction.
We conclude that the complaint is lacking in substance in those aspects of
it that claim discrimination on the ground of sex and religious
or political
activity or belief. The complaint in all its other aspects should proceed to a
full hearing. Section 44C does not permit
us to strike out a complaint in part
(compare s136(1) (a)
Equal Opportunity Act 1995
). The application under s44C is
therefore refused.
The basis of Mr Lovejoy's complaint before the Tribunal is contained in
further particulars of complaint filed with the Tribunal dated
10 February 1995,
but excluding the matters struck out by the orders of the Board on 10 April 1996
relating to the status of the
applicant, insofar as it related to Mr Lovejoy's
private life (in particular his religion) and his sex. What remains is a
on the grounds of the impairment or imputed impairment of Mr Lovejoy
in the area of the provision of goods and services, the particulars
discrimination being set out in the further particulars of complaint dated 10
February 1995.
The hearing of the complaint was listed to commence on 7 October 1996. As the
hearing of the proceeding did not commence before 1
January 1996, Section 217 of
Equal Opportunity Act
provides that it is to be heard by the
Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, applying the provisions of the old Act, and that
for that purpose
the Tribunal has all the powers, functions and duties of the
Board under the old Act.
Leave to appear was granted to Mr Perkins and Mr Gros for Mr Lovejoy and Ms
O'Brien for the respondents.
The hearing of this application in all took 25 days, spread over some 17
months. The reasons for the length of this hearing were as
Mr Lovejoy's apparent distress
from time to time about the proceedings, and our judgment that it would have
been unfair to Mr Lovejoy
to proceed without a break at those points which gave
him obvious physical and emotional
Several adjournments when
counsel for Mr Lovejoy requested adjournments on account of his medical
condition or his unavailability
for personal
The occasions when Mr
Perkins made applications for the Tribunal to disqualify itself from further
proceeding on the grounds of actual
or perceived bias which necessitated the
hearing being suspended while those applications were considered and ruled
On 23 October 1997, the 25
day of the hearing, at a point which
appeared to be towards the conclusion of the respondents' case, Mr Perkins
informed the Tribunal
that he would not be available the following week, which
had been set aside for the balance of the hearing. By this stage Mr Gros
long since ceased to appear with Mr Perkins. Mr Perkins informed the Tribunal
that it was not possible to find a substitute counsel
and that, in his view, it
would be unfair for Mr Lovejoy to represent himself. On the basis of Mr Perkins'
submission, we formed
the view that his submission was an application for an
adjournment. Before addressing the adjournment application we invited counsel
make submissions. Mr Perkins declined and Ms O'Brien made a number of
submissions. We determined that having regard to the submissions,
unfair course of action was to adjourn at the conclusion of the next day's
proceedings to a date to be fixed. Ms O'Brien
then informed the Tribunal that on
instructions she was making an application for an order for costs against Mr
Perkins personally.
Mr Perkins then indicated that if an application for costs were made against
him personally, he considered that he had a conflict
of interest and would
withdraw as counsel for Mr Lovejoy, and he withdrew. Both Mr Perkins and Mr
Lovejoy left the hearing. The Tribunal
then informed Ms O'Brien that in the
absence of Mr Lovejoy or his representative any submissions she proposed to make
should be made
in writing in order to allow Mr Lovejoy every opportunity to
respond to them, either himself or through a representative.
The hearing was adjourned. The respondents subsequently informed the Tribunal
that they would call no further evidence and had closed
their case. As the case
was then closed, the Tribunal made arrangements for submissions by both
The manner in which submissions were dealt with was by written submissions
and responses by both parties and, at Mr Lovejoy's request,
a day (the 13 March
1998) was set aside for him to make further oral submissions. The respondents
then provided a written response
to those oral submissions.
Legislative Framework
Following the reasons given on 10 April 1996 on the strike out application,
what is before this Tribunal is a consideration of Mr
Lovejoy's claims of
discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the ground of his
impairment, or past impairment, or
imputed impairment, and his claims that he
was victimised by the respondents.
Mr Lovejoy's claims relate to a period between May and December 1993 and thus
the provisions of the
Equal Opportunity Act
Section 4 (1) of the 1984
contains the following relevant
definitions:-

the reason for the private life of a person."
Section 17 sets out the criteria for discrimination. Sub-section (1) is as
Criteria for discrimination

has brought proceedings against
the first-mentioned person under this
has given evidence or
information in connexion with proceedings brought by any person against the
first-mentioned person under this
has otherwise done
anything under or by reference to this
in relation to the first-mentioned
person or any other person;
has alleged that the
first-mentioned person or any other person has committed an act which (whether
or not the allegation so states)
would amount to a contravention of this

the other person intends to do any of those things or suspects the other person
has done or intends to do any of them.

that cannot reasonably be

that can on reasonable
grounds only be provided by the person performing the service on more onerous
terms than the terms on which
the service could be reasonably be provided to a
person not having that impairment.
(3) This section does
not apply to discrimination on the ground of race-
in relation to affording
persons of a particular race exclusive access to services designed to meet the

What Must the Complainant Prove
To succeed, Mr Lovejoy must prove that he has been discriminated against on a
ground proscribed by the
in an area covered by the
. The burden of proof
is on Mr Lovejoy, and he must prove his case on the balance of probabilities. It
is well established, however,
that in applying this standard of proof normally
applicable in civil issues, the nature of the issue may influence the degree of
satisfaction of proof that a tribunal may require.
In other words, the seriousness of the allegations, the inherent unlikelihood
of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity
of the consequences
flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the
answer to the question whether the
issue has been proved to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Tribunal. In
Briginshaw v Briginshaw
[1938] HCA 34
(1938) 60 CLR 336
which is the long standing authority for this proposition,
J at page 361 says that "
when the law requires the proof of any
fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence
can be found
The grounds proscribed by the
include status which, in turn, includes
impairment. "
" is broadly defined in Section 4 (1) of the
It means a total or partial loss of a bodily function; which in turn includes a
mental or psychological disease of disorder. It
includes present and past
impairment and an impairment which is imputed to a person.
Mr Lovejoy relies on Section 17 (1) of the
. Under Section 17 (1)
discrimination occurs, if on the ground of status of a person, another person
treats that person less favourably
than the other person would treat persons of
a different status in the same or not materially different circumstances.
By Section 29 (1) (a) and (b) and Section 4 (1) of the
Mr Lovejoy claims
discrimination by Myer Stores Limited and by Mr Part on the ground of his status
in the provision of or the terms
of the provision of goods and services. To
succeed, Mr Lovejoy must prove, on the balance of probabilities:-
that he has an impairment or imputed
impairment in the terms of the definition of impairment under Section 4
that he has been the subject of less
favourable treatment in the terms of Section 17 (1) of the
, by Myer and/or
that the less favourable
treatment by Myer and/or Mr Part was on the ground of the impairment or imputed
impairment of Mr Lovejoy;
that if there
were two or more reasons for the less favourable treatment by Myer and/or Mr
Part, that the impairment or imputed impairment
of Mr Lovejoy was a substantial
reason for the less favourable treatment (Section 4 (7)).
Lovejoy also complains that he has been discriminated against by Mr Part and
other employees of Myer in breach of Section 18 of
, generally described
victimisation
". To succeed under Section 18 Mr Lovejoy must show that
Myer or Mr Part treated him less favourably in the terms of the

or had alleged that Myer or
Mr Part had committed acts which would amount to contraventions of the
Section 18 does not apply (that is, it is a defence to Section 18) if the
allegation made was false and not made in good faith.
It is not in dispute in this case that the respondents are in the business of
providing goods and services, that Mr Lovejoy has shopped
at Myer for many years
and that he has operated an account with that store for many years. Nor does
Myer Stores Limited dispute that
it is responsible for the actions of its staff
and employees or agents, including any security staff.
In 1993 the respondents purported to ban Mr Lovejoy from entry into their
store. On the face of it then, they have treated Mr Lovejoy
less favourably than
others who were not banned or sought to banned from the store. Mr Lovejoy claims
that on numerous occasions
he was followed by staff in the store and that on
numerous occasions, was asked to leave the store, and that on all those
the request for him to leave and the way the respondents treated him,
whilst making those requests, constituted less favourable treatment.
claims that the less favourable treatment to which he was subject was on the
ground of his impairment or imputed impairment.
A preliminary issue we must consider is the issue of whether or not Mr
Lovejoy has, or had, an impairment as defined in the
Mr Lovejoy called no witnesses nor produced any evidence that he had or has
had a mental or psychological disease or disorder and,
indeed, he vehemently
denied this. Ms O'Brien, counsel for the respondents, submitted that no expert
evidence was submitted to the
Tribunal that Mr Lovejoy suffers or has suffered
malfunction of a part of the body
a mental or
psychological disease or disorder
". She submitted that it was not open to
the Tribunal to rely on evidence of Mr Lovejoy as to any or what condition he
claims to have
or have had and referred to Mr Lovejoy's complaint form and
attachment wherein Mr Lovejoy said "
suffered from any
psychiatric illness
". Ms O'Brien also referred to Mr Perkins' opening
remarks on T10 L6-9 wherein it is asserted Mr Lovejoy, until about 1986, was in
and out of psychiatric hospitals, and further to T373 and T387 where he asserts
he has been admitted to psychiatric hospitals.
She submitted accordingly that the only basis on which Mr Lovejoy can make
out his claim is pursuant to Section 4 (1) (f) "
an impairment which is
imputed to a person
There is a degree of contradiction and equivocation in Mr Lovejoy's case on
whether he suffers or did suffer from an impairment. However,
Mr Lovejoy in his
submissions on 13 March 1998 at T1650 L12-19, 21 and 23 stated:-
Now, we've heard arguments from both sides, counsel for both the
complainant and the respondents and Mr Perkins referred to the DSM3
knowledge or authority. Then further on towards the very end, around 25, he
again refers that Myer think that they can
discriminate against people who
suffer from a mental illness and, you know, no legal - now, at no time had I
given instructions that
I suffer from a mental illness. O'Brien is correct - -
MR RECHTMAN: Can I just stop you - - -
DR LOVEJOY: - - - when she submits it's an imputed impairment
MR RECHTMAN: Thank you. That's what I was getting to.
DR LOVEJOY: Yes
Based on his own submissions and the way in which his case has been put, we
consider his case must therefore proceed on the basis
that Myer and Myer staff
has imputed to him an impairment.. He must therefore show that Myer treated him
less favourably because
it imputed an impairment to him, in this case a mental
illness, or at least that Myer or Mr Part treated him less favourably because
they imputed to him behavioural characteristics which they considered arose, or
would arise, from the impairment they imputed to
Mr Lovejoy's case is that the evidence before us shows that directly or by
necessary implication he was treated less favourably and
that was because of an
impairment attributed to him. Mr Lovejoy gave evidence himself and, although
every opportunity was given to
him to call other witnesses, and indeed, matters
were adjourned to allow extra time for him to do this, he did not call any other
witness. Mr Lovejoy's case is therefore based on his own evidence and evidence
elucidated in cross-examination of witnesses called
for the respondent.
Mr Lovejoy was led by his counsel through each of the incidents listed in the
particulars of complaint. He was cross-examined and
re-examined. In all, this
took over seven days. It was for him a difficult and distressing process.
To assist with his recollection Mr Lovejoy was permitted to refer to his
" which was a hand-written diary kept by him. It was difficult
for him to give evidence in a clear and decisive manner, and therefore
for the Tribunal to assess what weight would be placed on his evidence. The
following passage commencing at page 442 of
the transcript, we consider, is a
fair illustration of the nature of the evidence Mr Lovejoy gave.
Mr Lovejoy, what I would like you to tell the tribunal is what happened
at Myer?---I was assaulted out of the store more than 100
times over a period of
mother's day to christmas or harassed if you don't like the word, legal term,
legal conclusion of assault
which there are authorities which constitutes legal
assault, what constitutes harassment or stalking etcetera, etcetera.
Would you tell us, please, what you mean when you talk about being
assaulted out of Myer?---It means I was physically man-handled
against my will,
my person was touched.
Yes?---Putting me in a state of fear, apprehension, stress.
All right?---Etcetera.
Now, on 15 July of 1993 do you recall some things occurred apropos of
Myer?---15 July 93?
Yes?---Two security officers on Bernie Elliott's orders - - -
Now, the particulars did say I think - - -?---3.24 pm.
That Bernie Elliott - Mr Lovejoy, I just want to ask you about
something?---Yes.
They did say and that is not what you say, is that correct? It was in fact
two security officers, is that correct?---No. No, it may
mean that Bernie
Elliott personally saw me or I saw him at that time, at 3.24 also with two
security officers at another location,
at another time at Myer on that
All right. Now, there is a reference there to "bridge across Little Bourke
Street". Can you tell us where this occurred and what happened,
please?---Bridge
across Little Bourke Street, expulsion from store, harassment, assault,
humiliation, I underlined humiliation. It
means that the manner by which I was
harassed and assaulted out of the store was intended to humiliate me before all
of the staff.
Did you find it humiliating?---I wouldn't have underlined it if it hadn't
been humiliating.
Do you have any other note relating to 15 July?---Yes. Thursday, 15 July

means they were right on my
Can you describe what you mean by that? I understand generally but I would
like you to tell us - - -?---On this occasion I remember
Yes?---It was as if they were provoking me beyond human endurance where if
I made a legal mistake, if I reacted as nitro glycerin
or a sick person I may
have - I'm not Arnold Schwarznegger, I'm an ex priest, I'm a pacifist. I've
always been a pacifist.
All right, do you remember what happened - - -?---But they were trying to
provoke me into a physical fight. That's the simple answer.
Yes?---They were harassing me and humiliating me to such an extent that if
I hadn't been a priest and a barrister at law, anyone else
would have probably
assaulted them physically, violently. They just couldn't have controlled
themselves. Although I can't control
my stress at the moment. Excuse me for the
very loud voice.
Yes, go on, could you continue?---They followed me down the escalators and
out of the store all the way past the perfume and cosmetic
departments.
Could you explain what the significance of those departments in the way
you felt about it was?---Well, a quarter of a century ago
I worked in a perfume
factory in Paris. Next thing I'm being assaulted and humiliated by two thugs in
front of all the employees.
Some of them daughters of ladies and gentlemen,
thereby my reputation was shattered, destroyed and the innuendo, the gossip, the
slander, defamation compounded and my bad reputation and my infamy spread like
Ash Wednesday or a forest fire.
Do you have any further note relating to what happened on that day?---Yes,
there's still - - -
Other similar examples can be found in the transcript commencing at pages
424, 438, 454, 458, 467, 488, 516, 530 and 538.
In many instances Mr Lovejoy was not able to articulate anything more than a
repetition of the words in the written particulars themselves.
His evidence was
repetitious, convoluted and difficult to follow.
In his further particulars, Mr Lovejoy sets out a number of circumstances on
which he relies, which he alleges occurred. He set out
all these circumstances
in tabular form.
There were a number of events listed, about which the only evidence Mr
Lovejoy gave was to simply repeat the allegation. Such events
included the

The evidence he gave about the alleged incident on 16 June 1993 which appears
at pages 434 and 435 of the transcript illustrates the
kind of evidence Mr
Lovejoy gave. It reads:-
All right. Do you recall anything that occurred in Myers on 16 June 1993,
around midday?---Could I have a look at my log book? I may
or may not have it
logged in this particular log book because I have so many of them.
Yes May Mr Lovejoy do that?
DEPUTY PRESIDENT: If he looks at his logbook, he might be able to answer
more promptly.
MR PERKINS: Yes. Well, thank you. Yes. You may do that?---I don't know
whether there is notation in this logbook, because this is

Well, have a look, Mr Lovejoy.
DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Well, we would want to see the one in 1993.

With regard to the incident alleged to have occurred on 16 June 1993, we are
not satisfied that he has produced any evidence for us
to be satisfied that the
particular event alleged in that particular of complaint in fact took place. For
the same reasons we are
not satisfied Mr Lovejoy has made out his claims with
respect to his allegations of events alleged to have taken place on 18 June
1993, 30 July 1993 or 9 October 1993.
There were two incidents about which Mr Lovejoy gave no evidence at all.
These were described in his particulars as follows:-

As a consequence, we cannot take these alleged events into account in our
considerations.
There was a further group of events where the evidence led by Mr Lovejoy
constituted legal conclusions made or put by Mr Lovejoy about
the nature of
certain occurrences. For example, in his Particulars he refers to an assault on
22 June 1993.

The only evidence he gave for this alleged assault appears at page 438 of the
transcript which shows the questions Mr Perkins asked
and Mr Lovejoy's answers:-
Mr Lovejoy, if you cannot now say anything about that date, I will go to
the next date.
I would like you to tell us please - are you able to tell us what, if
anything, occurred at Myers to you, on 22 June of 1993? - -
I was assaulted. That means I was assaulted out of the store, if the word
"assault" was used, it means that the body language, the
conduct, the manner of
being evicted out of the store legally in my mind constituted legal assault as
distinct from any other possible
interpretation of the word.
You understand, do you not, that it is the tribunal's function to attach
any relevant legal label to what occurred and I would like
you to please, tell
us just what happened, if you can be more specific?---I can't.
The assertions he made and the conclusions he drew were not backed up by any
There was another class of incidents where Mr Lovejoy mentioned names or
persons or places, but did not give any evidence of what
conduct actually
constituted the alleged harassment, assault, abuse, humiliation or inducement.
He often simply repeated the particulars
or referred to a different time or
place from those detailed in the particulars. For example, about an incident on
1 November 1993
referred to in the particulars as:-

As it turns out other evidence led in the hearing indicated that this
incident took place outside the store and did not involve Myer
staff personnel
At no stage during his evidence despite specific questions by his counsel,
did Mr Lovejoy repeat the assertions he had made in his
original complaint and
his letter of 26 January 1994. First, was the allegation that Myer management
had said to him on 16 June 1993
you are not a lawyer, you are insane,
we can do anything we like to you and there is nothing you can do about it
Second, that Bernie Elliot said to him "
you are a 'schizophrenic' not a
lawyer we can do anything we like to you, and there is nothing you can do about
". Nor did Mr Lovejoy give any evidence about an inducement he alleges he
was offered in December 1994 to withdraw his complaint except
to repeat in his
closing submission the words in the Particulars. In fact whilst giving evidence
I have decided to treat the conversation between
myself and Mr Lawry as without prejudice, privileged.
" (see page 626 of the
transcript).
Those allegations go to the heart of Mr Lovejoy's claim because they may
constitute evidence that the treatment received by Mr Lovejoy
respondents if less favourable treatment was based on an impairment or imputed
impairment. Mr Lovejoy's failure to make
those allegations on oath despite every
opportunity during lengthy evidence in chief and cross-examination lead us to
conclude that
we cannot accept, on the balance of probabilities, that there is
any evidence before us that the statements were ever made.
Notwithstanding that Mr Lovejoy has been unable to prove that certain alleged
incidents did not take place, there is common ground
that on their face there
were several incidents which may indicate that Mr Lovejoy was treated less
favourably on the ground of an
impairment or imputed impairment.
With respect to those sufficiently articulated incidents, there is dispute
between the parties about what actually happened, what
was said, what was done
and what was the demeanour and attitude of particular individuals.
The respondents denied the allegations set out in paragraph 1 of the
Particulars dated 10 February 1995, but admitted that at various
times between
May and December 1993 they exercised what the respondent claims was their right
to revoke Mr Lovejoy's licence to remain
on the premises and that by letter
dated 29 November 1993 it purported to withdraw his licence to enter Myer
stores. They denied
that these acts constituted discrimination in the provision
of goods and services or alternatively discrimination in the terms of
goods and services within the meaning of the
, because they were not done on
the grounds of the status of Mr Lovejoy.
The respondents denied the allegations set out in paragraph 2 of the
Particulars which covered the period from Christmas 1993 to December
admitted that pursuant to the withdrawal of Mr Lovejoy's licence they did from
time to time ensure that Mr Lovejoy left
the premises. They denied that that
conduct constituted discrimination in the provision of goods and services,
alternatively in the
supply of goods and services within the meaning of the

____________________________________________________________________"
The evidence before us disclosed that Mr Lovejoy is referring to an evening
lingerie parade "
Hickory Goes Hollywood
" held on 7 May 1993. In his
Particulars Mr Lovejoy alleged he was assaulted by "
" at 7.30 pm on
We heard evidence from Mr Lovejoy and from Ms Linda Bagot who was a security
guard on duty in the area that evening. Both were cross-examined.
Essentially,
Mr Lovejoy asserted he was obstructed from sitting down on the seats at the
parade by Ms Bagot and regarded himself
as under arrest. Having heard and
considered all the evidence, we were not satisfied Mr Lovejoy's recollections,
which were inconsistent
when cross-examined, were accurate. In cross-examination
he qualified his original assertions that "
he was under arrest at law
saying that he assumed it. In cross-examination he could not or would not say
where the change rooms were. Ms Bagot gave her evidence
in a clear and
forthright manner and was unshaken in cross-examination. Briefly, her evidence
was that Mr Lovejoy had been standing
behind the catwalk near where the models
entered the change rooms. She had approached him and told him he was not allowed
there and he responded by saying to her "
are you threatening
". We accept her evidence about what happened. Her recollections were
clearer and more consistent. Mr Lovejoy's recollections were
confused and
lacking in clear recollection of detail. On the evidence, we have found there
was nothing done by Ms Bagot which could
be interpreted as "
person. There was no evidence Mr Lovejoy was touched nor that he was told he was
under arrest. Mr Lovejoy's assumptions were at
best his perception not based on
any factual sub-strata. Mr Lovejoy led no direct evidence that the
" directed at him in this incident was based on his status, other
than his general assertions that all the conduct of Myer and its
staff was based
on his status, to which we will refer later.
We are satisfied that on the evidence before us Mr Lovejoy was not treated in
a less favourable manner on the grounds of an imputed
impairment, but was dealt
with in a manner consistent with reasons which Myer considered bona fide and
without regard to Mr Lovejoy's
status, to which we will also refer later.
There were a number of matters put to Mr Lovejoy in cross-examination about
other instances and about his general behaviour. They
concerned, for example, Mr
Lovejoy's alleged offensive threatening behaviour in the Myer fashion
consultant's office and approaches
to a particular female staff member. As
matters ran, the respondents did not call any evidence about those matters.
The respondents called evidence to explain the reason why Mr Lovejoy had been
asked to leave on the occasions when that took place.
They called evidence about
Mr Lovejoy's presence in the women's fashion areas of the store on a number of
occasions, his demeanour,
and the anxiety this caused to staff and models. They
denied Mr Lovejoy's allegations of harassment and assault.
Exhibit 6 is a letter from Mr Part to Mr Lovejoy dated 29 November 1993. Mr
Part gave evidence and we will return to that later. We
refer to the letter here
because, although sent in November, it gives some history to the matters with
which we are concerned.
Dear Mr. Lovejoy,
I refer to your further letter dated 22
November 1993 and
again reject your assertions that you have been maligned or otherwise unfairly
treated. Please note that while
absolutely rejecting the substance of your
claims, I do not intend to continue expressing denials to what I view as efforts
a perception of unfairness through the lodging of frequent letters
containing various assertions.
However innocently, it is the fact that your presence in certain areas of
our store and at certain times, for example during lingerie
fashion shows,
causes a feeling of anxiety to some staff and models, and after being so advised
and you providing assurances that
it would cease, your presence in those areas
continued. There is nothing more or less alleged in respect of your conduct than
but on the balance of convenience and fairness, we have been left with no
option but to withdraw your licence to be on the premises.
I note that Mr. Cairns, when he rang, expressed surprise at the existence
of my letter of 27
October, and I note also that at no time have
you acknowledged receipt of it. In these circumstances I enclose a copy for you.
regard both to the contents of this letter and your letter of
November, I doubt that there is anything to be achieved by us
meeting, particularly given your threat of legal proceedings.
Yours faithfully,

Ms Donna Summers (nee Rudrum) gave evidence for the respondents. Ms Summers
had been a model who did parades at Myer at the relevant
time. It is worthwhile
to set out briefly her evidence.
Ms Summers said that she first became aware of Mr Lovejoy in 1986 when he had
sandwiched himself in between her car and car door.
He then very regularly
turned up at fashion parades when she was modelling. He would try and approach
her after parades and leave
messages. She said at Christmas 1992 she received in
the mail what she described as "
pornographic photographs
". There were
photographs of Mr Lovejoy dressed and undressed accompanied by a letter. She
received a further letter which concerned
her failure to reply to the first. She
described the contents of the letters as best she could recollect. She had
reported this to
Richmond police because she was quite concerned, especially
because they had been sent to her home address. She gave everything to
police. The matter was formally followed up and she was approached about whether
she wanted to lay charges or make a statement.
She said that as she was just
then leaving the State she had not made a statement.
In cross-examination in answer to a question put, she also described a parade
in February 1993 where Mr Lovejoy had followed her while
she walked down one
catwalk and up another, and she said this had made her extremely nervous.
She said that she had made Mr Andrew Rumble, who used to book her for
parades, well aware of these matters and extra security was
provided for her and
the other models. She said that Mr Lovejoy attended the parades in which she was
modelling on a regular basis
and that he would locate himself quite near the
doorway where the models were walking out near the change rooms. She said it was
an unusual place to be, considering there was seating always provided for
everyone in other parts of the area in which these parades
were conducted.
She was cross-examined at length and during that cross-examination provided
details of the vigorous efforts she had since made to
recover the letters and
photographs without success. She was cross-examined at length about her
knowledge of Mr Lovejoy's background
and about what others had done in response
to her concerns. In the answers she gave there was nothing to suggest she knew
or expressed any views about Mr Lovejoy, nor was she aware
of what anyone else
had actually done concerning him.
Ms Summers was a very impressive witness and her evidence was more compelling
after cross-examination. We accepted her evidence.
The sending of the photographs, their contents and the sending of the two
letters was put to Mr Lovejoy in cross-examination. His
evidence was quite
contradictory. He both denied and admitted sending the photographs to Ms
Summers. He also denied and admitted
their contents. (See T656 L19-20, T669
L5-6, T661 L17-18, T669 L19, T706 L24-27, T728 L3-5, T772 L10-15, T773 L3-12.)
He prevaricated
T660 L8-9, T661 L17-18).
There is no doubt in our minds that Mr Lovejoy sent Ms Summers photographs of
himself, both dressed and undressed, accompanied by
a card or a letter and that
he sent a further letter. We are satisfied that this caused Ms Summers great
concern, such that she reported
these matters to the police. We are satisfied
that she reported her concerns to Mr Rumble, who provided extra security. We are
that, as a result, Myer became concerned to ensure Mr Lovejoy's
conduct did not cause distress and anxiety to its staff.
Mr Stephen Part also gave evidence and was cross-examined at length. He is a
team leader with Myer and in 1993 was General Manager
of the Myer Melbourne
store. He was the author of three letters to Mr Lovejoy dated 27 October 1993,
10 November 1993 and 29 November
1993. The last is set out above. He stated that
he had been approached by Andrew Rumble in around February 1993, but without
formally coming forward with complaints, matters were not taken further.
He said that on the evening of 7 May 1993 Mr Lovejoy had
come to see him with a
complaint about his treatment at a fashion parade. He said he listened to Mr
Lovejoy and was courteous and
that Mr Lovejoy had become loud and angry. Under
lengthy cross-examination he denied that anyone had told him anything about Mr
or that anyone had collected information about him. He denied that he
had formed any view about him, that he wondered about the state
of Mr Lovejoy's
mental health, that he regarded him as "
out of touch
" or that he
presented as bizarre and unusual.
He denied any knowledge of any of the newspaper articles that Mr Lovejoy
believed had made him a social outcast and the victim of
abuse, fear, insult,
harassment and humiliation and, denied being shown such an article whilst he
spoke to Mr Lovejoy on the evening
of 7 May 1993.
He denied that he had at any time treated Mr Lovejoy discourteously. Mr Part
was subjected to lengthy cross-examination; his evidence
was unshaken. Mr Part
said he had not regarded Mr Lovejoy as bizarre and unusual at the time of their
meeting on 7 May 1993, which
we find difficult to accept. We are satisfied,
however, that the reasons for Mr Part and Myer treating Mr Lovejoy less
(by excluding him from the store) were because of his behaviour in
the store which had caused concern to the staff. Even if Myer
and its staff saw
him as being bizarre and unusual, there is not sufficient evidence to indicate
that they considered that as an
imputed impairment or that it was a substantial
ground for his treatment. We are confirmed in this view by the fact that Mr
had been a customer of Myer for many years prior to the alleged
incidents and still shops there.
Considering Mr Lovejoy's evidence as a whole, we formed the view Mr Lovejoy
had difficulty distinguishing between matters of fact
and matters he perceived
or imagined. We found him to be an unreliable witness who had a confused
recollection of events. Even where
there were incidents surrounded by some
evidence, he was inclined to take the worst possible view of affairs which, as
it turns out,
tended to support his perception of how and why he was allegedly
Following the adjournment of the hearing in October 1997, the respondents
filed detailed written submissions to dismiss the complaint

first answer-response to the
respondent's submission to dismiss the complaint dated 10 November 1997.
and foreshadowed a "
second answer-response
The first answer-response comprised considerable material in a large inset
binder. As we understand it, he submitted that counsel
for the respondents had
misrepresented the facts and his evidence under oath and had done so in a way
calculated to mislead the Tribunal.
Included in his submissions was a 45 page
document with the title "
General Proof of Evidence
A reply was received by the respondents on 15 December 1997 and the Tribunal,
as explained earlier, gave Mr Lovejoy leave to address
the Tribunal in person on
13 March 1998.
In so far as Mr Lovejoy's submissions may have contained evidence of new
allegations or new evidence about earlier allegations, we
find that evidence
unreliable for the same reasons referred to earlier. We acknowledge the point
made by the respondents that Mr
Lovejoy had closed his case, that it was not
evidence given under oath and that the respondents have not been able to test
the evidence.
Returning to the respondents' submissions. Very detailed submissions to
dismiss the complaint were filed by both respondents. For
many reasons outlined
earlier it is not surprising that they were so detailed, given the course the
hearing had taken. We have not
had to answer those submissions in detail given
that the real weakness of Mr Lovejoy's complaints has been the inadequacy of the
evidence advanced by him, both as to alleged events and as to the reasons for
the conduct alleged.
As the evidence was led and witnesses were cross-examined, it appeared that
Mr Lovejoy's case may have been that because his behaviour
(as he put it) had at
all times been reasonable, courteous and appropriate, there were no other
possible reasons for the way the
respondents treated him other than because of
an impairment. It is open to the Tribunal to reach a finding of discrimination
proscribed ground if the evidence as a whole indicates there could have
been no other credible reason for the conduct. (See
Department of
Health v Arumugam
[1988] VicRp 42
[1988] VR 319.)
This submission was never formally put. However, even if it had been, it must
fail because there is ample evidence before us of other
reasons for the conduct
of the respondents towards Mr Lovejoy, other than an impairment imputed to him,
namely, his behaviour and
conduct in the store.
Mr Lovejoy also alleges that he has been victimised by Mr Part and other
employees of Myer because of his complaints about the conduct
of Myer staff in
breach of the

Part and or any employee of Myer was by reason

In conclusion where there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a
particular incident
in fact take place, we find:-

intimidation;
where that conduct was
less favourable, that conduct was based on grounds that Myer and its staff
considered were reasonable having

and the concerns of female
there is not sufficient
evidence that the less favourable conduct was wholly or on the ground of Mr
Lovejoy's status, or that his
status was a substantial ground or reason for the
less favourable conduct.
Mr Lovejoy's complaint must therefore be dismissed.
In the course of conduct of the hearing, the question of costs arising out of
adjournments, delays and applications was raised. On
each occasion we deferred a
decision for determination as part of final submissions. In the end, no
submissions were made as to costs
and no order for costs is made.
