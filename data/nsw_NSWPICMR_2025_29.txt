STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
is a dispute between Rehan Ahmad Faiz (the claimant) and the insurer about the
amount of the claimant’s pre-accident weekly
earnings (PAWE) for the
purpose of weekly payments of statutory benefits under Division 3.3 of the
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
(the MAI Act).
claimant was involved in a motor accident on 25 February 2025.
claimant lodged an application for personal injury benefits.
13 June 2025 the insurer determined the claimant’s PAWE amount in the sum
of $915.02.
17 June 2025 the claimant requested an internal review of the insurer’s
decision dated
13 June 2025.
30 June 2025 the insurer issued their internal review decision in which the
insurer varied PAWE to $1,730.
claimant has requested a Merit Review of the insurer’s internal review
decision dated
30 June 2025 (the
Application).
BACKGROUND/PROCEDURAL HISTORY
claimant contends he had the following sources of income in the 12 month period
before the accident:
(a) earnings under an Australian Business Number (ABN) from Uber driving;
(b) earnings under the same ABN as a sole trader providing automotive/mechanical
services, and
(c) earnings as a mechanic employed by Aeroklas Asia Pacific Group (Aeroklas).
evidence has been provided in respect of any earnings as a sole trader providing
automotive/mechanical services at any material
further documents were provided by the claimant for the purpose of the
insurer’s internal review, the insurer contends
there is insufficient
information from the claimant to enable any further review or assessment of
review of the documents indicated further documents ought to be available to the
claimant relevant to assessment of PAWE and ought
to be provided by the
claimant. Accordingly, on
1 August 2025 interim directions were issued to
the parties (the interim directions) which required the claimant to
(a) a complete copy of their 2023, 2024 and 2025 tax returns, including the
supplementary sections (note: the current version of
the 2024 tax return
provided is incomplete as it does not include the supplementary section where
business expenses are declared);
(b) notices of assessment for 2023, 2024 and 2025;
(c) ATO pre-filing statement for the financial year ending 30 June 2025, if the
tax return has not yet been lodged;
(d) the BAS for April to June 2025;
(e) payslips issued by Aeroklas for the period from commencement of employment
in or about August 2024 to 30 June 2025;
(f) bank statements for the account into which Uber earnings, Aeroklas earnings
and other income has been received for the period
25 February 2024 to
(g) monthly Uber tax summaries for the months of February 2024 to June 2024
inclusive and January and February 2025;
(h) Uber tax summary for FY2024/2025;
(i) a summary of expenses incurred in deriving Uber income including telephone
and motor vehicle expenses (rent/hire, petrol, registration,
tolls, insurance,
CTP, repairs) for the period 25 February 2024 to 24 February 2025, and
(j) any further submissions and/or documents relied upon.
claimant has not fully complied with the above directions as follows:
(a) payslips provided under interim direction 1(e) are limited to payslips to
25 February 2025 despite other documents evidencing payment of wages by
Aeroklas after this date;
(b) bank statements for account ending 942 are limited to the period
December 2023 to 10 October 2024 such that all bank statements required by
direction 1(f) have not been provided;
(c) bank statements for account ending 964 for the period 26 October 2024 to
26 November 2024 have not been provided such that all bank statements
required by direction 1(f) are not provided;
(d) the claimant failed to provide the 2024/2025 financial year Uber tax
summary, as required by direction 1(h), and
(e) the claimant failed to provide any documents regarding business expenses, as
required by direction 1(i) (the claimant clearly
would have had business
expenses in connection with his Uber driving income not limited to those listed
in the Uber tax summaries).
interim directions gave the parties an opportunity to request a teleconference
before determination of the merit review application.
Neither party requested a
teleconference and accordingly, the matter proceeded to determination on the
SUBMISSIONS
claimant submits all necessary documents have been provided and that the
documents establish his PAWE is $3,563. The applicant
also seeks contributions
to his superannuation account by the insurer in lieu of contributions that would
have been made by his employer.
The claimant submits he has been unable to work
since the accident and continues to have no capacity for employment.
claimant does not explain how he has calculated PAWE in the sum of $3,563.
insurer submits the claimant’s PAWE assessment falls under Schedule 1, cl
4(2) of the MAI Act on the basis there was a significant
change in earning
circumstances on
26 August 2024, which triggers cl 4(3), when the claimant
commenced employment with Aeroklas.
insurer submits the claimant’s PAWE has been calculated pursuant to cl
4(2) based on gross earnings received from Aeroklas.
insurer acknowledges the claimant received other income from Uber during this
period but says there is insufficient information
upon which to calculate the
additional Uber earnings and accordingly, Uber earnings are not
Legislation
insurer accepts cl 4(3) of Schedule 1 of the MAI Act applies on the basis the
claimant commenced full time employment with Aeroklas
on 26 August 2025 and on
this basis, began to earn more than he was earning before this change.
Accordingly, the claimant’s
PAWE falls for assessment under Schedule 1, cl
4(2)(b), which provides that the claimant’s PAWE
“...the weekly average of the gross earnings the earner
received as an earner, or could reasonably have been expected to receive,
the 12 months after the change of circumstance... occurred”.
does not appear to be any dispute that cl 4(2)(b) applies. There also does not
appear to be any dispute about the amount of
Aeroklas earnings for the purpose
of cl 4(2)(b). The dispute is in relation to the amount of additional Uber
earnings for inclusion
in the PAWE
calculation.
Consideration
evidence establishes that from 26 August 2024 the claimant became entitled to
earn gross weekly earnings, including allowances,
from Aeroklas in the sum of
$1,730. This is the basis of the insurer’s PAWE calculation.
claimant submitted a schedule of earnings in which he contends as of 10 July
2025 he has received nil earnings from any source
of employment or
self-employment since the accident. Other documents, however, put the veracity
of this statement into question.
For example:
(a) 2025 tax return: an additional $9,612.45 in wages from Aeroklas is included
which cannot be accounted for by accrued leave entitlements
(according to the
payslip year to date gross earnings as of 25 February 2025 were $45,851.54 yet
by 30 June 2025 the claimant had
earned $55,464 from Aeroklas indicating ongoing
wages received after the accident), and
(b) bank records: the claimant has not provided bank statements for account 942
(the account into which Aeroklas wages were paid)
for any period after
October 2024 (despite the following, unprovided, statement number 44 being
relevant to PAWE). However, a comparison of the available
statements for both
accounts shows the claimant routinely transferred these wages from account 942
to account 964 with account 964
showing this continued post-accident that is, a
net wages amount of $1,353 continued to be transferred from account 942 to 964
a weekly basis for a period of time after the accident.
the above is relevant to the question as to whether there is any loss of
post-accident for the purpose of payment of weekly benefits (a
matter for the insurer to determine) the observations are also relevant
Merit Review, as follows:
(a) clause 4(2)(b) requires consideration of earnings/expected earnings over the
12-month period from when the change occurred. In this case, the change
occurred 26 August 2024 and accordingly, the 12-month period
is 26 August 2024
to 25 August 2025, with the outstanding documents required by the directions
falling within this period, and
(b) the conflict between the claimant’s statement in the schedule of
earnings and the financial documents puts the veracity
of the claimant’s
evidence into question such that his contention his PAWE is $3,563 should be
carefully scrutinised.
insurer acknowledges there were additional Uber earnings pre-accident relevant
to PAWE but says the information is incomplete
to calculate the average weekly
Uber earnings from 26 August 2024 to the day before the accident (24 February
the claimant is able to demonstrate Uber earnings in the period 26 August 2024
24 February 2025 there should be an additional allowance included in PAWE
based on the weekly average of Uber earnings over this 26-week
issue is the absence of sufficient evidence of business expenses. It is clear
the claimant incurred business expenses in addition
to those summarised in the
Uber summaries. However, the claimant has not provided the documents requested
in the interim directions
my view, the following might be a reasonable work around for calculation of
business expenses:
(a) determining gross Uber payments exclusive of GST noting payments to the
claimant are inclusive of GST;
(b) taking the average expenses percentage of income based on the potential tax
deductions (tolls, service fees etc) listed in the
Uber tax summaries, which is
an average of 42% (for example, gross earnings of $5,103 inclusive of GST are
stated in the March 2024
Uber tax summary, which is $4,639 net of GST. This
includes taxable expenses totalling $1936 which represents 41.7% of gross
net of GST);
(c) taking the expenses percentage from the claimant’s 2024 tax return
(being the nearest complete year for Uber driving),
which is 65% indicating
additional expenses not listed in the Uber tax summaries such as petrol, vehicle
maintenance and repairs
and other motor vehicle expenses equating to an
additional 23% of business income, and
(d) therefore allowing 65% of gross Uber earnings, excluding GST, for total
business expenses based on (b) and (c) above.
claimant does not indicate how he calculates PAWE in the sum of $3,563 but this
would be an additional allowance of $1,833 per
week for Uber earnings. In my
view, this far exceeds any calculation available on the documents. Even if the
GST component were not
removed, making no allowance for business expenses and
using the totals from monthly Uber tax summaries for August 2024 to February
2025 (that is, including payments received before 26 August 2024 and after 24
February 2025) the weekly average Uber earnings would
be $1,189 bringing PAWE to
$2,919, which is considerably less ($644) than the contended $3,563. The correct
amount of course would
be even lower, as the GST component must be removed,
business expenses must be deducted and the August 2024 and February 2025
received before 26 August 2024 and after 24 February 2025 respectively
must be excluded from PAWE.
the veracity of the claimant’s contentions about post-accident earnings is
in question careful consideration must also
be given to the claimant’s
contentions about pre-accident earnings. On this basis and as PAWE only
concerns earnings actually
received by the claimant in the relevant period the
bank records are likely the most accurate means of calculating gross Uber
with a reduction then applied for the GST component as the amounts
received into the bank accounts are inclusive of GST (business
expenses would
then also need to be deducted).
available (incomplete) bank statements evidence a total of $11,285.90 inclusive
of GST received by the claimant into his bank
accounts from Uber in the period
26 August 2024 to 24 February 2025. On this basis, the additional allowance for
Uber earnings would
be $138.10 per week calculated as follows:
(a) $11,285.90 gross earnings received inclusive of GST equates to $10,259
exclusive of GST;
(b) 65% allowance for business expenses is $6,668.35, and
(c) $10,259 gross earnings net of GST less $6,668.35 for business expenses
results in net business earnings (before tax) in the sum
of $3,590.65 which
equates to a weekly average of $138.10 over the 26-week period from 26 August
24 February 2025.
would bring PAWE to $1,868.10 ($1,730 per week in respect of Aeroklas earnings
plus $138.10 per week for Uber earnings).
difficulty I have with this is that there are a number of inconsistencies in the
available documents and there are clearly missing
documents (required by the
interim directions but not provided by the claimant) relevant to assessing Uber
earnings under cl 4(2)(b).
On the available documents, Uber payments into the
claimant’s bank accounts do not reconcile with the monthly tax summaries
and neither the (incomplete) bank statements nor the tax summaries are
reconcilable with the tax returns. For example, the September
2024 tax summary
records a gross payment to the claimant of $2,797.84 but payments in the bank
statements in the same month total
$2,201.08. There is a difference in amounts
between the tax summaries and bank statements for every month.
also appears from the bank statements that there may be a third bank account,
not disclosed by the claimant, which may be relevant
(perhaps the account for
business expenses and/or additional Uber earnings).
note, the August 2024 and February 2025 tax summaries cannot be relied on
independent of bank statements as they clearly include
payments made before 26
August 2024 and after 24 February 2025 respectively.
way of further illustration of inconsistencies, the 2025 tax return declares
gross Uber earnings exclusive of GST in the sum of
$34,981 which equates to
$38,479 inclusive of GST. This differs to the total gross earnings inclusive of
GST for the period 1 July
28 February 2025 in the sum of $40,810.07
shown in the monthly Uber tax summaries. The tax return amount also differs from
total payments
received into the claimant’s bank accounts from 1 July 2024
to 24 February 2025 in the sum of $21,924.10 (noting the claimant
contends no
Uber earnings were received after the accident). The claimant failed to provide
the required 2024/2025 financial year
Uber tax summary, which may assist to
clarify some of the inconsistencies.
have given careful consideration as to whether the claimant’s PAWE should
be determined on the available bank statements and
adopting 65% of business
income for business expenses, which would equate to PAWE in the sum of $1,868.10
based on the calculation
set out above. However:
(a) the bank statements are incomplete (the evidence establishes the claimant
received Uber payments from time to time into both
accounts 942 and 964 (and
possibly a third account) and accordingly, he ought to provide complete
statements for the whole of the
period requested in the interim directions for
both accounts and if there is a third account this should also be provided);
(b) there are inconsistencies in the documents about what earnings the claimant
did in fact receive from Uber in the period 26 August
2024 to 24 February
(c) the claimant has not fully complied with the interim directions;
(d) there is a question about the veracity of some of the claimant’s
contentions such that careful consideration should be
given to the evidence;
(e) the request for additional documents made by the insurer and in the interim
directions ought not be onerous to the claimant and
there is no reasonable
explanation as to why they have not been provided. The documents requested ought
to be readily available to
the claimant (for example, the claimant ought to have
to hand missing statement number 16 for account ending 964, missing statement
number 44 for account ending 942 and his 2024/2025 financial year Uber tax
summary, noting the claimant has prepared his 2025 tax
return), and
(f) the claimant bears the onus of establishing his PAWE amount based on
evidence that appears to the decision maker to be truthful,
reliable and cogent.
regard to the above I have determined the most appropriate course is for the
claimant to have an opportunity to provide the
outstanding documents to the
insurer if he wishes to have Uber earnings included in the PAWE calculation
(indeed, there are presumably
additional bank records not presently provided,
which show receipt of additional Uber earnings). In the meantime, it is
appropriate
that the reviewable decision is affirmed that is, the
claimant’s PAWE amount remains as $1,730 unless and until further
are provided by the claimant to enable redetermination by the
to the extent the claimant seeks superannuation contributions from the insurer
superannuation contributions are not earnings
received by the earner for the
purpose of the MAI Act and are therefore excluded from PAWE. The insurer is not
liable to make superannuation
contributions on behalf of an injured person under
the motor accident statutory benefits scheme.
insurer is to redetermine PAWE based on additional information from the
claimant, if requested to do so by the claimant.
the claimant requests a redetermination of PAWE by the insurer the additional
information to be provided by the claimant for that
purpose is to
(a) a complete copy of bank statement number 44 for account ending 942 (being
the statement for the period 11 October 2024 to 11
April 2025);
(b) a complete copy of bank statement number 16 for account ending 964 (being
for the period 26 October 2024 to 26 November 2024);
(c) a copy of the statement of income for the financial year ending 30 June 2025
from his ATO MyGov account in respect of Aeroklas
earnings, and
(d) a copy of his 2024/2025 financial year Uber tax summary.
the meantime, the reviewable decision is affirmed.
