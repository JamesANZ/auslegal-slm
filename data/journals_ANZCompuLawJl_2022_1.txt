A NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT
Computers & Law
Journal was first published in 1983 as a joint
publication of all Australian and New Zealand Societies for Computers and the
Many leaders from across the legal and computer science professions
contributed to the Journal, including the founders of the New
South Wales and
Victorian Societies, Professor Graham Greenleaf and Julian Burnside.
Over the years, the content and style of the Journal has undergone a number
of iterations, culminating in its relaunch with this volume.
It is now a
professional, academically recognised publication, contributing to important
discourse on the intersection of law, policy
and technology. The three tiers of
content – Academic Articles, Thought Leadership Essays and Industry
Reports – are
a reflection of the growing diversity of AUSCL’s
membership, the critical nature of the issues being discussed and the importance
of learned discussion.
Offering a tiered approach, aligns with AUSCL’s mission to co-create a
sustainable future, as we strongly believe that interdisciplinary
intergenerational engagement is essential for carefully considering and solving
some of the most significant challenges faced
by modern society.
On behalf of AUSCL and the present and future readership of this Journal, I
thank Professor Natalie Stoianoff (Editor-in-Chief), Associate
Professor Maria
O’Sullivan (Managing Editor – Academic), Rob MacLean (Managing
Editor – Industry), the Editorial
Board and our publisher, AustLII, for
their vision, professionalism and perseverance in bringing this project to
fruition for the
benefit of all.
