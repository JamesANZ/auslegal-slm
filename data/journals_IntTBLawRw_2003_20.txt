By Raymond Jack, Ali Malek and David Quest,
Documentary
Credits—The Law and Practice of Documentary Credits Including Standby
Credits and Demand Guarantees,
Butterworths, UK, 2001
This third edition, eight years after the previous one, introduces two new
authors and substantial re-writing in the areas of fraud,
electronic credits,
originality, standby credits, and conflicts of law.
The terms ‘documentary credits’ and ‘letters of
credit’ are both in current use and no distinction need be
made between
them. ‘Standby letter of credits’ have a different function and a
chapter is devoted to them. The International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Uniform
Customs and Practice (UCP) set the international banking standards. Documentary
credits facilitate
international transactions providing a promise by a bank of
immediate or future payment against the presentation of document to the
its agent, most commonly in the sale of goods.
The authors point out that the UCP are accepted by banks in over 160
countries, including Commonwealth countries, making their application
almost universal.
With the incorporation by banks of the UCP into the contracts in connection
with credits, a code can provide uniformity in the rights
and obligations to
which those contracts give rise. The authors urge the courts to adhere to the
code, where incorporated, providing
it is not in conflict with an express
provision, and in conflict with common law precedents prior to the 1993
Although this book covers the English law, it makes greater use of
Commonwealth and US materials. This overseas material is particularly
in considering an area of law where the principles are common to many
The authors again highlight the remarkable statistic that over half of all
documents presented are discrepant on first presentation.
To assist students and
practitioners, the ICC’s Position Papers 1 to 4, the UCP (1993 Revision)
and the ICC Uniform Rules for
Demand Guarantees are appended. To assist students
to familiarise themselves with the documents commonly used, Lloyds TSB Bank plc
has allowed publication of their specimen forms in the appendices.
The authors postulate that as a consequence of the risks associated with the
acceptance of commercial documents, standby credits,
demand guarantees and
performance bonds have become increasingly popular. This edition devotes
considerable space to the major development
in this area: the introduction of a
new set of rules, International Standby Practices 1998 (ISP98). They believe
that as the ICC
endorses ISP98 it is to supplant the use of the UCP for
Unlike commercial credits, where the bank pays against a bill of lading or
other transport document evidencing shipment of goods,
the purpose of a standby
credit or independent guarantee is usually to give security against the
applicant’s breach of contract,
not to enforce performance. Thus, in
Bachmann Pty Ltd v BHP Power New Zealand Ltd,
Booking JA stated on 11
September 1998, Supreme Court of Victoria Court of Appeal (unreported):
International trade is facilitated by traditional credits, which provide a
mechanism for performance of contracts of sale. Standby
credits are a safeguard
which comes into play where there is a suggestion that contracts (whose
subject-matter can vary widely) have
been broken.
For example, the seller/beneficiary will call on a commercial credit whenever
the goods are shipped, but an employer/beneficiary will
(or should) call on a
standby credit or independent guarantee only if he believes that the contractor/
applicant is in breach.
The other batch of instruments, variously called demand guarantees,
performance bonds, etc, is fully explained under the general term
‘independent guarantees’. The House of Lords considered performance
Trafalgar House v General Surety Co
(1996), but the confusing
terminology in use may still lead to difficulties in construing particular
instruments.
The work is comprehensive in bringing the profession up to date with
electronic credits. As a documentary credit is a written record
physical good, it appears eminently suitable for implementation in electronic
form. However, as it is only one element
in the international sale transaction,
an electronic credit must be part of an overall system for electronic trade.
Mindful of the
security risks of the interception, accidental corruption,
forgery, or deliberate modification of messages en route, the authors
that with a reliable system of authentication, electronic messages potentially
provide a much more secure method of communication.
Whilst the regular use of such instruments as part of international trade is
still a little way off, the authors deal with initiatives
under development and
examine the legal problems which will be encountered with electronic documents.
They advise on the impact of
the Electronic Communications Act 2000.
The extensive revision on fraud and injunctions takes account of recent cases
on the right or obligation of the bank to refuse payment
where there is evidence
of fraud. Fraud is an exception to the principle of autonomy which requires the
credit to be treated as a
transaction independent from the underlying contract
between applicant and beneficiary, and unaffected by disputes on that contract.
It is also an exception to the rule that a bank deals in documents alone, and is
obliged to pay against documents which are conformant
on their face without
regard to their accuracy or genuineness. The foundation stone of English law in
this area is a United States
Sztejn v Henry Schroder Banking Corp
(1941). This is authority that the court may interfere to prevent a bank paying
against documents, and that the same fraud would
entitle the bank of its own
motion to refuse to pay. Important new decisions covered in the text include
Themehelp v West
Czarnikow-Rionda Sugar Trading Inc v
Standard Bank London
(1999) on injunctions, and
Banco Santander SA v
Banque Paribas
(2000) on discounting of deferred credits. The authors note
that the Commonwealth authorities have made an important contribution
development of the law in this area.
As documentary credit disputes almost always have an international element to
them, the chapter on ‘Conflicts of Law and Illegality’
greater detail at jurisdictional and choice of law issues, including the
Brussels and Rome Conventions.
Since the previous edition, the area of greatest controversy has been the
debate over original and copy documents, sparked by the
decision of the Court of
Glencore v Bank of China
(1996), and fanned by that in
Kredietbank Antwerp v Midland Bank
(1999). This decision represented a
loosening of the rule of strict compliance which the authors suggest goes too
far. Whilst the
ICC issued a policy statement intended as a
‘clarification’ of Article 20 (ambiguity as to the issuers of
of the UCP, the authors are convincing in their view that it is
difficult to reconcile with either of the two court decisions. The
English law
will have to clarify this ‘unsatisfactory’ matter, prior to the next
