Sentencing Snapshot 277: Sentencing Trends for Obtaining Property by
Deception in the Higher Courts of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
obtaining property by deception in the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria
(the higher courts) from 2017-18
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on obtaining property by deception and other offences is
available on
Advisory Council Statistics (SACStat)
A person who, by any deception, dishonestly takes property belonging to
another person with the intention of permanently depriving
that person is guilty
of obtaining property by deception. Obtaining property by deception is an
indictable offence that carries a
maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of up to 1,200 penalty
It can be tried summarily in
the Magistrates' Court if certain criteria are
This Snapshot focuses on cases where obtaining property by deception was the
principal offence, that is, cases where obtaining property
by deception was the
offence that received the most severe
Obtaining property by deception was the principal offence in 0.8% of cases
sentenced in the higher courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous
years because the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 64 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of obtaining property by deception.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
obtaining property by deception by financial year. There
were 9 people sentenced
for this offence in 2021-22, and 8 were sentenced in the previous year. The
number of people sentenced was
highest in both 2019-20 and 2017-18 (16 people)
and lowest in 2020-21 (8 people).

Over the five-year period,
most people sentenced for obtaining property by deception received a principal
sentence of imprisonment
(70.3%, or 45 of 64 people). The rate of imprisonment
sentences fluctuated over the five years, ranging from 62.5% in both 2019-20
2020-21 to 77.8% in 2021-22.

There were 45 people who received a principal
sentence of imprisonment for obtaining property by deception. Of these, 32
people (71.1%)
received a non-aggregate imprisonment term, that is, the
imprisonment term was not part of an aggregate sentence, and 13 people received
an aggregate term.
There were 9
people (20.0%) who received a community correction order in addition to their
imprisonment term.

of obtaining property by deception for the 32 people
who received a
non-aggregate imprisonment term. Imprisonment terms ranged from 3 months to 5
years and 6 months,
median length of imprisonment was 1 year and 7 months (meaning that half of the
imprisonment terms were below 1 year and
7 months and half were above).
The most common range of imprisonment terms was 1 to less than 2 years (9

in 2018-19 to 2 years and

obtaining property by

The most common ranges of total effective sentences were less than 1 year and
2 to less than 3 years (10 people each).

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an immediate
imprisonment term of less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole
period. For terms
between 1 and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion
to fix a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2 years or more,
must impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person must serve that
period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of
their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 45 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for obtaining property by
deception, 10 were not eligible to have a non-parole
period imposed because
their total effective sentence was less than one year. Of the 35 people who were
eligible to have a non-parole
period fixed, 33 were given a non-parole period
Figure 6 shows the non-parole periods in cases where the principal offence
was obtaining property by deception. Non-parole periods
ranged from 1 year to 6
years and 6 months, while the median non-parole period was 2 years and 3 months
(meaning that half of the
non-parole periods were below 2 years and 3 months and
half were above). There were 12 people who did not have a non-parole period
The most common range for non-parole periods was 1 to less than 2 years (13

The value of a penalty unit changes each year and can
be found on the Council's website. Penalty units are set annually and published
in the Victorian Government Gazette. Obtaining property by deception can, in
some circumstances when the value is $50,000 or more,
be a continuing criminal
enterprise offence. When it is, the maximum penalty doubles to 20 years'
imprisonment:
