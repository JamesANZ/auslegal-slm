Government and Information Access in the Modern State

Here is a substantial and welcome resource on Privacy and FOI in Australia,
filling at least partially a gaping void – there
is as yet no privacy law
textbook and the last comprehensive work on FOI is now more than 20 years old
and covers none of the actual
experience of FOI
. This review is
written from the perspective of a privacy practitioner, with some knowledge of
and much interest in FOI. It will
certainly be useful to all privacy
practitioners working in or for the public sector. For administrative law
academics and students
and FOI practitioners, who together form its main market,
it will be even more valuable.
The book is mostly descriptive material – explaining the relevant
statutes and regulations, exploring differences between the
different Australian
of relevant case law –
from administrative tribunals and courts. The
related area of public records law is brought together in the analysis with
and FOI, and the book is current enough to describe the innovative
Northern Territory Information Act which brings the three areas
together in one
law. It is also able to address the other recent innovation of purpose-specific
health privacy and access laws,
in the ACT, Victoria and NSW.
The relatively brief commentary sections of the book offer interesting
insights into the reasons for and effect of the differences,
demonstrating the
author’s familiarity with the FOI laws in particular.
Victorian Privacy Commissioner Paul Chadwick, in launching the book on 15
“In particular, [the author] makes useful observations about the
interactions of FoI and information privacy. ... As [the author]
points out, in
Victoria, at least, there is work to be done to make the interaction more
coherent. ....The right to access and correction
of one’s own information
is basic, and at present it lives awkwardly in two statutes.”
The author explores the somewhat schizophrenic relationship between privacy
and FOI, illustrating how privacy law can be a valuable
instrument of
accountability to partner FOI laws, whilst also sometimes proving a barrier to
openness and transparency.
Given the focus of the book on access and accountability, the treatment of
the access and
correction and transparency principles. The other privacy principles receive
only brief descriptive attention, although
the introductory and concluding
chapters offer tantalising glimpses of a wider analysis which the author will
hopefully pursue in
future work.
In the opening and closing chapters, the author provides a timely summary of
the way in which recent changes in the political and
technological environments
have both increased the potential for government surveillance and also hastened
a retreat into secrecy.
She also documents the failure of Australian FOI laws
to live up to their promise, and to the experience in other jurisdictions,
significantly open up government decision making processes. The dominant use of
Australian FOI laws by individuals to access
records about themselves, whilst
welcome in the context of privacy rights, is in stark contrast to the relatively
low level of use
by the media, businesses and non-government organisations to
hold governments to account.
The detailed description in the book of the exemptions, processes, fees and
charges, and of the way in which these have all been litigated,
provides much of
the explanation for this imbalance in use of FOI laws. The author also reviews
the many reports and reviews which
have criticised the weaknesses and
inadequacies of the Australian FOI and privacy laws and their implementation
– so far with
few sympathetic responses from any of the relevant
governments.
It is of course asking a lot of incumbent governments to open themselves up
to greater scrutiny, or to subject themselves to effective
That is why the main hope for improvement lies in frustrated opposition parties
committing themselves to reform
in advance of elections, and then moving quickly
enough to implement those reforms before the ‘Sir Humphrey Appleby’s
in their bureaucracies can persuade them that they are not in their own
The author contrasts the apparent success of the NZ Official Information Act
– an indigenous solution to FOI with a much stronger
presumption of
information availability - with the perceived failures of the Australian FOI
laws, based as they are on the US model
but without the accompanying Bill of
Rights, with a less highly developed separation of powers, and with a much more
nuanced balance
between a principle of openness of documents and a raft of
detailed exemptions.
The concluding chapter summarises the depressing trend in recent years to
weaken FOI laws both by amendment, by administrative practice
and by political
interference in FOI decision making. The author notes that greater use of
commercial-in-confidence and cabinet-in-confidence
exemptions, of conclusive
ministerial certificates, and of fees and charges, together with cutbacks in
resourced devoted to FOI administration
and education have all contributed to
this weakening. Ms Paterson suggests that in addition to the many useful
recommendations of
the 1995 Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) Open
Government report – yet to be addressed by government, future reform
needs to take account of the changed governmental landscape in which there is no
longer a clear separation of public and private
sectors. Claims of transparency
and accountability need to be applied to functions and activities rather than
particular agencies
In relation to Information Privacy Laws, the author concludes that it is
probably a ‘second best’ locus for individual
access rights. Access
to personal information under FOI appears to work quite well and academic
arguments for leaving it entirely
to privacy laws should perhaps be resisted,
especially given the general lack of resources for Privacy Commissioners to
promote and
enforce rights. Ms Paterson also notes the unfortunate lack of
significant privacy jurisprudence, particularly at the Commonwealth
For the future of privacy law, she suggests an urgent need for greater
uniformity and consistency between jurisdictions, for bringing
Australian laws
up to accepted international best practice standards (with a warning about the
potential weakness of the current
APEC approach) [see Greenleaf’s article
elsewhere in this issue], and for changes to deal with new technologies and
delivery techniques.
In these respects, and in her criticism of the widespread exemptions in
Commonwealth Privacy Act which she foreshadows but which have reported
subsequent to the publication of her book [also summarised
in this issue].
Apart from the contribution which the analysis makes to the privacy debate in
Australia, the substantive descriptive chapters on access
law and review rights
and processes, supported by detailed summaries of the case law to date, form a
very valuable resource. The
author is to be congratulated on this landmark
publication.
