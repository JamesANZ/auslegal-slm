Divcon (Australia) Pty Ltd v Devine Shipping Pty Ltd [1996] VicRp 58; [1996] 2 VR 79 (21 March 1996)
DIVCON (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD v DEVINE SHIPPING PTY LTD
SUPREME COURT OF VICTORIA
12, 21 March 1996
The dispute in this case concerns the operation of r25.02 and r36.03 of the Supreme Court Rules. The rules read:
Discontinuance or withdrawal of proceeding or claim.
25.02 (1) This Rule applies only to a proceeding commenced by writ.
(2) A plaintiff may discontinue a proceeding or withdraw any part of it -
(a) before the close of pleadings; or
(b) at any time, by leave of the Court or with the consent of all other parties.
(3) A defendant may discontinue a counterclaim or withdraw any part of it -
(a) before the close of pleadings; or
(b) at any time, by leave of the Court or with the consent of all other parties to the counterclaim.
(4) At any time the plaintiff may withdraw a defence to counterclaim or any part of it and a defendant may withdraw his defence or
any part of it.
(5) Para(4) does not enable a party to withdraw an admission or any other matter operating for the benefit of another party without
the consent of that party or the leave of the Court. -
(6) A defendant who has joined a third party may discontinue the claim made against the third party by the third party notice or withdraw
any part of the claim at any time by leave of the Court or with the consent of the third party.
Amendment of pleading
36.03 A party may amend any pleading served by him -
(a) once before the close of pleadings; or
(b) at any time, by leave of the Court or with the consent of all other parties.
The plaintiff filed the writ in the proceeding on 15 June 1995. The endorsement of claim on the writ was headed "Statement of Claim".
By virtue of the provisions of r5.04(3) it constituted the plaintiff's statement of claim.
On 28 July 1995 the defendant filed and delivered its defence and counterclaim. The defence contained a number of admissions.
On 24 January 1996, and without leave, the defendant filed and delivered an amended defence and counterclaim. That step was taken,
so it was argued, pursuant to the provisions of r36.03, that is, on the footing that as at that date the pleadings had not yet closed.
There was no debate before me as to whether or not the pleadings had in fact closed and for the purposes of the present application
I assume they had not.
At all events by its amended defence the defendant withdrew a number of admissions made by it in its original defence.
By summons filed in the court on 12 February 1996 the plaintiff sought an order that the amendments in question be disallowed.
The summons came before Master Evans on 22 February 1996. Master Evans took the view that r25.02(5) applied and that as the defendant
had not obtained the plaintiff's consent to the amendments or the leave of the court, ordered that the amended defence and counterclaim
be struck out. The master further ordered that any application by the defendant for leave to file and serve an amended defence in
the form of the amended defence he had struck out be made within 14 days of that date.
It is from those orders that the defendant appeals to a judge of the court.
The argument advanced on behalf of the defendant is that r25.02 has no application to a pleading amended pursuant to r36.03; that
if there was to be any restriction on the operation of r36.03, that restriction would have been made clear on the face of the rule
itself, for example, by including the words "Subject to the provisions of r25.02" at the commencement of the rule.
At first blush I was inclined to the view that that argument had merit. After all, if there was to be some fetter upon a party's
right to amend prior to the close of pleadings then one would expect a rule giving parties that right to make that clear on its face.
But having given further consideration to the matter, I have come to the conclusion that that should not be the case.
An admission in a pleading is a serious step for a party to take. It means that proof is no longer required or permitted of the fact
admitted as the fact is no longer in controversy between the parties: see Pioneer Plastic Containers Ltd v Commissioners of Customs
[1967] Ch 597.
Further, admissions by pleading entitle the court to make orders in favour of a party to which that party is entitled on those admissions.
See r35.04. As a matter of principle a party who has made an admission in a pleading should not be entitled to withdraw that admission
without good cause, for example, that the admission was made in error by the party who prepared or gave the instructions for the
preparation of the pleading, or as the consequence of a misapprehension by counsel or solicitor concerning the client's instructions.
In my opinion there can be no question of any conflict between r25.02 and r36.03. Read together they simply mean that a party may
amend his pleading once before the close of pleadings without leave, but that if the proposed amendment has the effect of withdrawing
an admission, then it can only be made with the consent of the opposite party or the leave of the court.
My conclusion, therefore, is that Master Evans made no error in the matter.
The appeal will be dismissed with costs to be taxed and paid by the defendant. I extend the time within which the defendant may make
the application referred to in Master Evans' order to 19 April 1996.
Appeal dismissed.
