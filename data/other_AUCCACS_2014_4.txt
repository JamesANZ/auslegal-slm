Appeal Outcome
Appeal allowed on grounds two and five.[52]
Offender resentenced to seven years six months imprisonment, with a
non-parole period of three years and six months.[60]
This Crown appeal was against a sentence in relation to offences of a
‘very serious kind of circumstances;’ where the
offender was in
breach of his parole and had a’ bad criminal record.’[4] The
offender stood to be sentenced in relation
to three offences; two further Form 1
offences were considered under
(Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
(NSW).[7] On appeal, the appellant/offender claimed that the total sentence
imposed was ‘manifestly inadequate.’[5]
All offences were committed in the city of Sydney and the offending occurred
whilst the offender was on parole for similar offences.
Form 1(Aggravated break enter and steal):
During the night of 6 February 2012, the offender gained entry to a residence
and stole the victim’s purse from the kitchen.
The offender used the keys
inside the purse to enter the victim’s motor vehicle, a blue station wagon
and drove it from the
First Offence (Aggravated break enter and stealing circumstances of
aggravation):
At 6:15 am on the 7 February 2012, the offender and another male entered a
residence by smashing the back door. The victim was awoken
and went to
investigate. The victim was approached and pushed to the ground, landing on her
back. The offenders demanded money and
stole cash and a mobile phone.
Subsequently, the offenders pushed the victim to the ground which caused her to
strike her head. The
offender and other male ran from the dwelling, escaping in
a dark coloured station wagon.[12]
Form 1 No 2 (Aggravated break enter and steal):
At 6:30 am on the 7 February, the offender gained entry to a residence
through the laundry. The offender stole the victim’s
laptop and handbag.
Afterward, the offender immediately exited the residence.[12]
Second Offence (Specifically Aggravated Break Enter):
At 7:00 am on the 7 February 2012, the offender and another male forcibly
entered a residence through the rear door. Both victims
heard noises from their
respective bedrooms and one went to investigate. The offender wearing the black
jumper approached the victim,
demanding money, proceeding to physically assault
the victim to his head and face. The victim collapsed and lost
consciousness.[12]
The offenders then entered the bedroom of the second victim, demanding money.
The offender wearing the black jumper, struck the victim
on the head with a
metal bar causing a head laceration. The offenders proceeded to steal items
belonging to the second victim. The
offenders also stole items belonging to the
initial victim. Subsequently, the offenders left the dwelling, stealing the
vehicle which was identified as a white Holden Commodore.[12]
Third Offence
Aggravated Robbery inflict Actual bodily
At 7:45 am on the 7 February 2012, the offender ran towards the victim,
‘forcefully’ grabbing her handbag from her shoulder.
The victim fell
to the ground, hitting her head and elbow on a driveway. The offender stole the
victim’s handbag. The accused
fled the scene in a white Holden
Commodore.[12]
On the 9 February 2012, the victim and witness identified the offender
through a photographic lineup presentation.[12]
The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances:
Mr Booth was aged 23 at the time of offending and was 25 years old when
sentenced.[15] He is the eldest of two biological sisters
of an Aboriginal
family and his paternal grandparents were forcibly removed during the Stolen
Generations.[15] The accused spent
his early childhood on a mission in Bourke,
where he was subject to violence[15.9] in an environment which ‘normalised
abuse.’[15]
At the age of 10 due to ‘inadequate care,’[15] the offender and
his sisters were removed from their parents. Mr. Booth
moved foster homes
approximately 20 times and was eventually separated from his sisters.[15] The
offender suffered sexual abuse in
a foster care home and has not received
counseling for this trauma.[15] The offender also attempted to hang himself at
10 years of
Mr. Booth has an ‘extensive’ history in polysubstance abuse.[15]
He first used cannabis at the age of seven or eight and
developed a daily
dependence. He began to sniff petrol at the age of 10 but has since ceased using
this substance. From the age of
18, the offender began using amphetamines and
commenced heroin usage at age 19. Whilst in custody the offender was a
participant
of a methadone program; however during the offences heroin and
alcohol usage has been admitted.[15]
The ‘offender is illiterate’ and left school during year 6.[15]
The Pre-Sentence Assessment noted that Mr. Booth demonstrated
intellectual disability’ with an IQ level ‘lower than 98 per cent of
the population.’[15] The offender
also demonstrated ‘impaired’
communication skills comparable to ‘a person aged between four years and
to six years and 10 months.’[15]
Mr. Booth also has an ‘extensive’ criminal record,[15] which
commenced when he was 11 years of age. He has made more than
10 appearances in
the Children’s Court for various offences including robbery and break,
enter and steal.[16] He has been in
and out of custodial institutions throughout
his life[16] and following incarceration as an adult, his longest period of
was just under three months.[15]
Aboriginal Customary Law issues raised:
Not applicable
Aboriginal Cultural Practice or kinship issues raised:
The offender was ‘unable because of his parole to travel to Bourke to
grieve with his family’ over the death of his two
aunties and two
cousins.[15]
Sentencing Considerations:
The Criminal Court of Appeal considered Toner J’s approach to
sentencing Aboriginal offenders who come from ‘deprived,
dysfunctional and
marginalised backgrounds.’[19] His Honour recognised that sentencing is a
discretionary exercise and that
‘no single correct sentence’ can
apply to all cases;
Pearce v The Queen
[1998] HCA 57
; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at
Markarian v The Queen
[2005] HCA 25
228 CLR 357
The court noted that this is a case that brings into very ‘sharp
focus’ the decisions in
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
; 249 CLR 571 and
Munda v Western Australia
[2013] HCA 38
; 294 CLR 600.[4] Hamill J observed that
sentencing Aboriginal offenders who are a product of the ‘distressing
circumstances
of disadvantage and deprivation’ in which they grew up,[4]
presents a ‘difficult and complex’ application of sentencing
discretion.
However the court confirmed the overarching conclusion, that there should be
‘no differential treatment of offenders based on
their ethnic or racial
background,’ as Australia does not have a legislative warrant to do
so.[20] This ensures that ‘individualised
justice’ is afforded to
all offenders (
Indeed, the court reiterated Wood J’s decision in
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A Crim R 58
In sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent, the court must avoid any hint of
racism, paternalism or collective guilt, yet must nevertheless
realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting
and by reference to the particular subjective
circumstances of the
offender.[24]
Moreover, Hamill J ‘commended’ the observations of Simpson J in
Kennedy v The Queen
(2010) NSWCCA 260
Properly understood,
is a decision, not about sentencing
Aboriginals, but about the recognition, in sentencing decisions, of social
disadvantage that
frequently (no matter what the ethnicity of the offender)
precedes the commission of crime.[25]
In this case, The Court of Appeal asserted that principles of sentencing
often ‘pull in opposite directions’ when determining
sentence.[4] Hamill J acknowledged that the offender had a ‘bad’
criminal history; however the court must
give ‘significant weight’
to the subjective circumstance of the offender[18] particularly where
‘deprivation, alienation
and dislocation’ is prevalent.[28]
His Honour, noted that due to the ‘high degree of criminality’
represented by the offender, the total sentence imposed
lenient.’[13] However, it is necessary to consider the personal
circumstances of the offender, in conjunction
with observations in
Muldrock v The Queen
[2011] HCA 39
; 224 CLR 120.[14] The court reiterated that despite the
imposition of a lengthy incarceration, a case as such with ‘critical
subjective circumstances’ ‘must be tempered with considerable
compassion and be structured in such a way to foster rehabilitation’
order to protect the interests of both the community and offender.[18]
Relevant Passage(s):
The principles of sentencing pull in opposite directions in terms of the
appropriate outcome. The respondent stood to be sentenced
in relation to
offences of a very serious kind in circumstances where he had a bad criminal
record and had breached parole. However,
his personal circumstances are such
that principles of general deterrence had little role to play and he was, to a
very large degree,
a product of the distressing circumstances of disadvantage
and deprivation in which he grew up. Those circumstances involve the
marginalisation
of rural and outback aboriginal communities and were described
by Judge Toner as "a national disgrace.[4]
Grounds of Appeal:
The offender claimed that the total sentence imposed was ‘manifestly
inadequate’ based on grounds that:[5]
1. His Honour erred in imposing sentences for each of the counts 1, 2 and 3
which are disproportionate to the gravity of the instant
offences.[17]
2: His Honour erred in the manner in which the sentences were accumulated
leading to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate total
sentence.[34]
3: His Honour erred in the manner in which the finding of special
circumstances was applied.[43]
4: His Honour erred in failing to have any regard to the principles of
deterrence leading to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate
sentence.[47]
5: His Honour erred in imposing a total sentence which in the circumstances
is manifestly inadequate.[52]
Appeal outcome(s):
Unsuccessful
The Court of Criminal Appeal discerned that Toner J’s approach was a
model of ‘orthodoxy and sensitivity.’[31] His
Honour concluded there
was no error in the exercise of discretionary power; to determine the extent to
which ‘compelling’
subjective circumstances impact the sentence.[31]
The court rejected the argument that the individual sentences were
‘inadequate
or disproportionate’ to the gravity of the
offending.[32]
The Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that the ‘discretion
miscarried,’[42] as there was no evidence to justify the imposition
wholly concurrent sentence for count 3.[41] Re-sentencing is necessary.[42]
Unsuccessful
The degree of departure from the proportions under
(Sentencing Procedure)
is a discretionary decision.[45] The court will
be very slow in intervening in such matters;[45] however due to resentencing,
ratio between the non-parole period and total sentence must be altered.[46]
Unsuccessful
Although it would have been ‘preferable’ for Toner J to
articulate his discretionary approach to deterrence [50], there
is no evidence
that the sentencing judge wholly disregarded the principle of
deterrence’[51].
Successful.
The offender effectively received no punishment for count 3.[53] Hamill J
concluded that in such circumstances, the total sentence
is ‘manifestly
inadequate ‘and ‘plainly unjust’ and
‘unreasonable’ in lieu of the absence of
any degree of accumulation
for count 3.[53]
