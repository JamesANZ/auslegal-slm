[1] On 11 May
2007, Leslie William Aynsley (“Mr Aynsley”) appointed Sean Patrick
McMahon (“Mr McMahon”) as
his power of attorney for health, personal
and financial matters if he lost capacity. Mr McMahon was also appointed as
Mr Aynsley’s
attorney for the purposes of a joint venture agreement
(“the JVA”) entered on 20 June 2007 between Mr Aynsely, as the
owner, and GWM Properties Pty Ltd (“GWM”), as the developer. The
joint venture concerned the development and sale
of land at Helensvale
(“the project”).
[2] In or about
2013, Mr Aynsley lost capacity. Mr McMahon’s appointment as
Mr Aynsley’s attorney was affirmed by the
Queensland Civil and
Administrative Tribunal. On 27 September 2017, a statutory will was made for Mr
Aynsley (“the will”).
On 3 February 2022, Mr Aynsley died.
[3] Pursuant to
(a) Mr McMahon became the sole trustee (and in that capacity is referred to as
“the JVTT Trustee”) of the Joint Venture
Testamentary Trust
established under the will (“the JVTT”);
(b) Mr McMahon and a Mr Hellen became co-trustees (and in that capacity are
referred to as “the LATT Trustees”) of the
Leslie Aynsley
Testamentary Trust established under the will (“the LATT)”);
(c) Mr McMahon and Mr Hellen became co-executors of the estate of Mr Aynsley
(and in that capacity are referred to as “the
Executors”).
[4] Pursuant to
cl 6.1 of the will, Mr Aynsley gave to the JVTT Trustee, his interests in the
joint venture to hold on trust pursuant
to the terms of the JVTT. This bequest
included, relevantly, the “JV Agreements” and “all matters
related to the
conduct of the joint venture pursuant to the JV
Agreements”. The term “JV Agreements” is defined in cl 19.3
the will to mean, essentially, the JVA as amended from time to time. Pursuant
to cls 6.2 and 6.7 of the will, the sole beneficiary
of the JVTT is the

discretionary power of the court to give judicial advice to a trustee is
inherently discretionary and “there are no
express words ... and no
implications ... making some discretionary factors ... more significant or
controlling than others”.
Every application depends on its own

concerned with determining what ought to be done in the best interests of the
The discretion of the court
to give advice “should not be yoked to a general first principle that,
where there is a contest
or where there are adversaries, it is not appropriate

Lyons J identified a
relevant consideration as being whether the trustee has taken proper legal
advice and that a reasonable trustee
might well abide by that advice. The
propriety of the proposed course of conduct falls to be considered. The matters
relevant to
the propriety of any course of action should not be exhaustively
stated. In any particular case, the matters may include the circumstances
trust and the resources available to the trustee, the steps taken by a trustee
to understand and consider the issues in dispute.
A particular matter which has
been recognised as relevant to the propriety of a proposed course of action by a
trustee is whether
the trustee has made “all reasonable inquiries ... to
establish the true
Public Trustee v Cooper
Hart J referred to a judgment of Robert Walker J which had been given in
chambers in 1995. Hart J quoted from that judgment which
had identified four
distinct situations when courts are asked to adjudicate on a course of action
proposed by or actually taken by
a trustee. The judgment of Robert Walker J
described one situation as follows:
“The second category is
where the issue is whether the proposed course of action is a proper exercise of
the trustees’
powers where there is no real doubt as to the nature of the
trustees’ powers and the trustees have decided how they want to
them but, because the decision is particularly momentous, the trustees wish to
obtain the blessing of the court for the
action on which they have resolved and
which is within their powers. Obvious examples of that, which are very familiar
in the Chancery
Division, are a decision by trustees to sell a family estate or
to sell a controlling holding in a family company. In such circumstances
is no doubt at all as to the extent of the trustees’ powers nor is there
any doubt as to what the trustees want to do
but they think it prudent and the
court will give them their costs of doing so to obtain the court’s
blessing on a momentous
decision. In a case like that, there is no question of
surrender of discretion and indeed it is most unlikely that the court will
persuaded in the absence of special circumstances to accept the surrender of
discretion on a question of that sort, where the
trustees are prima facie in a
much better position than the court to know what is in the best interests of the
beneficiaries.”
function of the court on that kind of application has been described in the
following terms by learned
commentators:
to see that the proposed exercise of the trustees’ powers is lawful and
within the power and that it does not infringe
the trustees’ duty to act
as ordinary, reasonable and prudent trustees might act, ignoring irrelevant,
improper or irrational
factors; but it requires only to be satisfied that the
trustees can properly form the view that the proposed transaction is for the
benefit of beneficiaries or the trust estate, that the proposed exercise of
their powers is untainted by any collateral purpose such
as might amount to a
fraud on the power, and that they have in fact formed that view. In other words,
once it appears that the proposed
exercise is within the terms of the power, the
court is concerned with limits of rationality and honesty; it does not withhold
merely because it would not itself have exercised the power in the way
[16] Having
regard to the material, I am satisfied that the JVTT Trustee has:
(a) since 2022, taken steps to seek to understand, in appropriate detail, the
factual and legal issues relevant to the potential
course of action;
(b) sought and considered appropriate legal advice from suitably experienced
solicitors and counsel;
(c) given appropriate consideration to all relevant issues; and
(d) formed conclusions which are reasonable, genuinely held and which might be
reached and held by an ordinary, reasonable and prudent
trustee who has ignored
irrelevant, improper or irrational factors.

application and I exercise my discretion in favour
