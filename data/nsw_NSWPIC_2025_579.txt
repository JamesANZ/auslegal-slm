WORKERS COMPENSATION -
Workers Compensation Act 1987
; claim for
medical expenses pursuant to
for sleeve gastrectomy, and future
ablations to the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints; applicant had accepted
psychological injury and
injury to the lumbar spine; whether the sleeve
gastrectomy and future ablations to the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints was
necessary as a result of the accepted injury;
sleeve gastrectomy and future ablations to the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints was
reasonably necessary as a result of the
accepted injury; the respondent to pay
the applicant’s medical expenses in respect of the surgery and treatment

to ss 59 and 60 of the
Workers Compensation Act 1987
(the 1987 Act).
future ablations to the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints as recommended by Professor
Laurence McEntee is reasonably necessary as a
result of the injury pursuant to
ss 59 and 60 of the 1987 Act.
The Commission orders:
respondent to pay the costs of and incidental to the sleeve gastrectomy,
pursuant to s 60 of the 1987 Act.
respondent to pay the costs of and incidental to the future ablations to the
L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints as recommended by Professor
Laurence McEntee,
pursuant to s 60 of the 1987 Act.
A brief statement is attached setting out the Commission’s reasons
for the determination.
is not in dispute that, in the course of her employment with the State of New
South Wales (NSW Police Force) (the respondent),
Rebecca Jane Couch (the
applicant), currently aged 55 years, sustained a psychological injury with a
date of injury of 6 September
2012 (the psychological injury) and a lumbar spine
injury with a date of injury of 20 January 2019 (the lumbar spine injury).
applicant has claimed the cost of the following medical and related
(a) past laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery which was performed by
Gratian Punch on 22 May 2023 (the sleeve gastrectomy), and
(b) future ablations to the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints as recommended by
Professor Laurence McEntee (the lumbar spine procedure).
respondent’s insurer declined the requests on the ground that it disputed
that the sleeve gastrectomy surgery and the lumbar
spine procedure is reasonably
necessary as a result of the injury as required by ss 59 and 60 of the
Workers Compensation Act 1987

cross-examine.
Applicant’s evidence
applicant gave evidence by way of several written statements respectively dated
1 September 2022, 29 January 2025 and 10 July 2025. In summary, the
applicant gave a detailed medical history which included:
(a) the applicant had a history of depression and treatment for depression from
time to time since about 2004;
(b) on or about 6 September 2012, the applicant sustained the psychological
injury and subsequently underwent various treatment of
that injury;
(c) in or about 20 January 2019, the applicant sustained the lumbar spine injury
and she was diagnosed with an L4/5 disc bulge and
L4 left nerve impingement, and
she underwent steroid injection for her back pain and rested her back;
(d) after a flare up of back pain, on or about 30 April 2019, the applicant
received treatment for her back at Robina Hospital and
was referred to a
specialist and prescribed pain medication including Targin and Endone;
(e) the applicant ceased work in 2019 and was medically retired from the
respondent, on medical grounds, on or about 18 February
(f) she is presently totally unfit for any work;
(g) the applicant gained excess weight through inability for activity and
medication that she was prescribed for treatment of her
injuries. She was
treated for weight loss over a 12-month period by Dr Jindabhai and then she
attended Dr Punch on 16 February 2023.
“At that time, [she] weighed around
135kg and [she]was using a walking stick by this stage. [She] weighed 149kgs
commenced”;
(h) the applicant’s “weight had fluctuated a little bit prior to my
injuries but [she] was usually around 100kgs in 2011
up until around 2015 when
[her] weight fluctuated between 105 – 120kgs”;
(i) the applicant was advised by Dr Punch to have laparoscopic division of
adhesions, hiatus hernia repair and sleeve gastrectomy
and she underwent the
surgery on 22 May 2023;
(j) the applicant has been consulting Dr Laurence McEntee, orthopaedic spine
surgeon, since 12 August 2021;
(k) since that time she continued to undergo various treatment consisting of
physiotherapy, exercise and weight loss, including sleeve
gastrectomy;
(l) following the sleeve gastrectomy, on 19 December 2023, the applicant was
reviewed by Professor McEntee and she had lost around
(m) she felt that she had more movement in her low back, but she did not feel
that her pain had reduced;
(n) on or about 13 May 2024, Professor McEntee told the applicant that recent
MRI showed ongoing disc degeneration at L3/4 and L4/5;
(o) Professor McEntee recommends treatment in the nature of radiofrequency
ablations of her L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints, which involves
thermal denervation
of the medial branch nerves supplying the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints, and which
she has been told can be an
effective treatment for facet joint mediated low
back pain, and
(p) the applicant wishes to undergo that treatment as she understands that it is
likely to lead to a significant reduction in her
Treating medical evidence
is a large volume of treating medical evidence in relation to the psychological
injury and the lumbar spine injury, including
referrals, reports, radiological
investigations and clinical records, and counsel referred me to various parts of
that evidence.
treating medical evidence includes evidence of the following matters which are
of particular relevance:
(a) various clinical records note the applicant’s weight and treatment
with weight loss medication from time to time, prior
and subsequent to the
psychological injury and the physical injury;
(b) a report of Dr Jindabhai dated 21 September 2012 noted that the applicant
was prescribed Pristiq to treat the psychological injury;
(c) reports of Dr Ng, treating psychiatrist, dated in 2012 and 2013 recorded
that the applicant was prescribed Pristiq medication;
(d) on 1 February 2019, the applicant reported to her treating general
practitioner that she had gained weight and had bodily aches,
that she had dealt
with difficult cases in the Police Force recently, and that she denied
depression, however that would be considered
if there were no adverse test
(e) on 15 February 2019, a CT lumbar spine was reported to show: at the L4/5
disc, mild posterior and left lateral disc bulge, foraminal
stenosis on the left
side and obliteration of the fat plane around the exiting left L4 nerve root
consistent with nerve root impingement;
and at the L5/S1 disc, mild broad based
disc bulge, with mild degenerative arthritic changes noted in the S1 joints
bilaterally;
(f) on 20 February 2019, the applicant underwent a CT-guided steroid injection
of the left L4 nerve root to treat the L4/5 disc bulge
and left L4 nerve root
impingement;
(g) on 3 May 2019, an MRI of the lumbar spine, in the context of worsening low
back pain, showed moderate reduction in disc height
at L3/4 and L4/5 with
minimal reduction in height and disc fluid signal at L5/S1, being mild lower
lumbar/lumbosacral disc degenerative
change without focal protrusion nor
neurocompressive complication;
(h) on 7 May 2019, the applicant attended the Emergency Department at the Gold
Coast University Hospital and was diagnosed with chronic
lower back pain. The
applicant was referred for treatment of the lumbar spine injury under a Chronic
Disease Management Plan;
(i) on 21 May 2019, Dr Chris Schwindack, neurosurgeon, reported that the
applicant complained of ongoing lower back pain. He recommended
physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. Dr Schwindack recorded that the applicant
weighed 119kg with a BMI of 42.7 kg/m2. Dr Schwindack
expressed his concern at
the large amounts of significant pain medication that the applicant was
prescribed and counselled the applicant
that it was not in her best interests to
continue taking those. Dr Schwindack stated that “I would suggest she
starts weaning
off the Lyrica as it’s particularly detrimental to her
weight, which she needs to get down”;
(j) on 14 August 2019, an MRI lumbar spine, in the context of a history of low
back pain with intermittent flare up, showed: mild
degenerative disc disease at
L4/5 and L3/4; a small disc osteophyte complex in the left posterolateral aspect
of L4/5 contributing
to mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing; but no
evidence of significant compression of the cauda equina or exiting nerve
(k) on 31 October 2019, Dr Jenan Abdulwahed, medicine review specialist
pharmacist, reported on the various medications that the
applicant had been
prescribed to treat chronic back pain and depression;
(l) on 11 November 2019, the applicant underwent inpatient psychological
treatment at Currumbin Clinic, which included her antidepressant,
Fluoxetine,
being switched to an alternative antidepressant;
(m) on 16 December 2019, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist, of Currumbin Clinic,
reported that in her opinion the applicant met criteria
for a DSM-V diagnosis
of: chronic pain secondary to musculoskeletal injury; and depressive disorder
due to chronic pain. Dr Burchgart
reported that Lyrica had been ceased, and
Gabapentin was commenced, and that Fluoxetine was ceased, and Duloxetine was
(n) on 20 February 2020, Dr Tim McDonald, psychiatrist, reported that the
applicant was compliant with medication;
(o) on 6 March 2020, Dr Liam Ring, pain medicine specialist reported that the
applicant was currently taking medication including
Duloxetine;
(p) on 3 September 2020, Dr Liam Ring, pain medicine specialist, reported that
the applicant was currently taking medication including
Duloxetine;
(q) on 16 June 2021, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist, reported that due to an
insuffient symptom response over an 18-month period,
the applicant had recently
been changed from Duloxetine to Venlafaxine. Dr Burchgart also reported that
other medication changes
included Thyroxine being ceased and replaced with
Lisdexamphetamine (Vyvanse) as an augmenting agent as well as for weight
(r) on 4 August 2021, an MRI lumbar spine showed: at L3/4 and L4/5 levels,
reduced T2 hyperintensity in the nucleus pulposus with
mild diffuse disc bulges
which were suggestive of early degenerative changes; and at L1/2 level, a small
focal disc protrusion, which
was new compared to the previous MRI lumbar spine
on 14 August 2019;
(s) on 11 August 2021, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist, reported that the
applicant was “recently changed from Duloxetine
120mg to Venlafaxine
(Effexor WR) due to weight gain and mental clouding”;
(t) on 25 November 2021, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist, reported on the
applicant’s progress;
(u) on 25 July 2022, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist, reported on the
applicant’s psychological conditions and treatment,
medications;
(v) on 18 August 2022, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist, reported that the
applicant had trialled Sertraline (2012), Fluoxetine (2019),
Duloxetine (2019
– 2021) and now Venlafaxine since mid-2021, and all doses had been
(w) on 29 November 2022, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist, wrote a letter in
support of the applicant receiving financial assistance
for a CPAP machine for
the management of sleep apnoea, “which is a condition I suspect she had
developed because weight gain
secondary to chronic pain from her workplace
(x) also on 29 November 2022, Dr Burchgart, referred the applicant to Dr Andrew
Slack of John Flynn Private Hospital, “for
your opinion and management of
suspected severe obstructive sleep apnoea, on a background of obesity secondary
to chronic pain and
major depression... a physical injury sustained in January
2019 which has been the primary cause of her pain and weight gain...”.
Burchgart stated that over time the applicant was treated with various
antidepressants including Duloxetine which was effective
clinically and for pain
but, which caused weight gain of around 20kg, and in late 2021 Duloxetine was
changed to venlafaxine with
good effect for depression but not for anxiety.
Dr Burchgart stated that adjunct treatment with lis-dexamphetamine for weight
suppression and to augment the applicant’s antidepressant
was started in
2020, with some benefit. Dr Burchgart noted that the applicant was due to have
bariatric surgery under the care of
Dr Jordaan in early 2023;
(y) on 26 January 2023, Dr Burchgart reported that the applicant’s
diagnoses included major depressive disorder secondary to
medical condition
(chronic pain), post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr Burchgart stated that the
major complicating issue now is the
applicant’s obesity and her day-time
somnolence (falling asleep suddenly) – likely related to obstructive sleep
which has yet to be definitively diagnosed and managed. Dr Burchgard
noted that the applicant was keen to have bariatric surgery
as she felt it would
improve her overall function;
(z) reports of Dr Bradley Ng, consultant psychiatrist, dated 22 March 2023,
23 August 2023 and 25 October 2023, noted that the applicant was prescribed
Pristiq and Murelax to treat the psychological injury;
(aa) on 20 November 2023, Dr Gratian Punch, treating specialist:
(i) reported that the applicant reported a history of gradual increases in her
weight following her ongoing back pain and deteriorated
mental health;
(ii) reported that, on examination, the applicant walked with the aid of a stick
and was in a Class III morbidly obese state –
with a weight of 135kg, with
a BMI of 48.4 kg/m2, and an excess weight of 65.28kg above the upper limit
normal BMI of 25 kg/m2;
(iii) expressed the opinion that the applicant’s need for bariatric
surgery arose from a combination of her post-traumatic
stress disorder
documented from 6 September 2012 as well as the back injury from 20 January
2019, noting that both of those issues
are known to be a causal relationship
with morbid obesity. Dr Punch referred to research in relation to post-traumatic
stress disorder
and obesity;
(iv) reported that on 22 May 2023, the applicant underwent laparoscopic division
of adhesions, hiatus hernia repair and sleeve gastrectomy;
(v) expressed the opinion that the applicant needed a metabolic/bariatric
surgery to assist with the mobid obesity state that occurred
after her injuries
sustained in the course of her employment: in order to access sustainable
weightless as surgery results in greater
improvement in weight loss outcomes and
weight associated comorbidities compared with non-surgical interventions; in
order to produce
significant and quantifiable reductions in back pain, noting
this would reduce the axial load and potentially improve quality of
the applicant should not be precluded metabolic care based on co-existing
post-traumatic stress disorder and psychological
care as this is not seen as a
contraindication to surgery for morbid obesity;
(vi) stated that during the course of metabolic care he discussed with the
applicant the potential use of injectable medication for
weight loss as a
non-surgical option, which approach had some limitations and expenses;
(vii) stated that on review of the applicant on 29 September 2023, the applicant
weighed 106.5kg, and she sleeve gastrectomy has
already resulted in significant
weight loss of 28.5kg, which is a 21% total body weight loss, which is a better
outcome than all
the reported medical treatments, the sleeve gastrectomy has
been effective and the applicant’s weight loss is tracking in line
all the expected outcomes;
(viii) stated that the applicant reported that the weight loss from the sleeve
gastrectomy has allowed her to recommence hydrotherapy
with a goal of building
muscle and balance;
(ix) expressed the opinion that the applicant suffered weight gain due to
immobility from her back injury, and also as a result from
medication she has
taken from her psychiatric condition, which is a known side effect;
(bb) on 22 January 2024, an MRI lumbar spine was reported to show: mild
multi-level degenerative changes and disc desiccation, most
marked at L3/4 and
L4/5, with no nerve compression;
(cc) on 13 May 2024, Professor McEntee requested approval to proceed to the
lumbar spine procedure, being bilateral L4/5 and L5/S1
facet joint
radiofrequency ablations as a day stay procedure at Pindara Private Hospital,
noting that the applicant presented with
ongoing low back pain after a
work-related low back injury and her pain appears to be facet-mediated;
(dd) on 16 May 2024, an MRI lumbar spine was taken;
(ee) on 27 May 2025, Dr Brook Burchgart, psychiatrist:
(i) expressed the opinion that the applicant’s weight gain is partially
attributable to psychotropic medication, noting that
the applicant was
overweight at the commencement anti-depressant treatment in late 2019, and she
gained a considerable amount of
weight in the months after she was stabilised on
Duloxetine. Dr Burchgart stated that Duloxetine does have the potential to cause
weight gain in some people, although that is not a universal effect;
(ii) stated that weight gain can certainly occur from physical injury associated
with pain or from post-traumatic stress disorder,
and the existence of both
conditions at the same time simply increases the likelihood of these outcomes
but not to the extent that
it is predictive of this outcome.
Dr Burchgart
stated that individual and treatment factors contribute to weight gain as well
and noted that individual factors relevant
to the applicant include age at onset
of injuries, gender and presence of perimenopause/menopause, reduced access to
usual support
networks, independent temperament and internalised coping
mechanisms, and ongoing exposure to precipitating or perpetuating factors,
example perceived exposure to threat from her community and need to avoid being
on Country due to this fear. Dr Burchgart stated
that treatment factors include
medication side effects such as weight gain, sedation or lethargy as well as the
illness itself and
whether there are residual symptoms impacting on function
such as amotivation and pain. Dr Burchgart stated that treatment factors
are relevant to the applicant includes absence of symptom remission despite
multiple attempts to augment her antidepressant
treatment across three different
psychiatrists and several inpatient admissions: along with augmented medication
management of her
chronic pain including neuropathic agents, muscle relaxants
and high potency opioid medications, noting that residual symptoms have
been present;
(iii) stated that Duloxetine has the propensity to cause weight gain, and
Venlafaxine can cause weight gain to a lesser extent. Dr
Burchgart stated that
Agomelatine is listed as having the least potential for weight gain, but she has
certainly met patients who
have experienced weight gain from Agomelatine, which
simply indicates that the potential for a medication to cause weight gain can
unique to the individual;
(iv) stated:
“I agree with Dr Verma’s opinion in so much that weight gain and
the inability or relative difficulty losing that weight
multifactorial in origin — for [the applicant] these factors have been
previously mentioned but include her age,
gender and hormonal factors including
peri-menopause, complex PTSD including childhood trauma and adversity and
further traumatisation
through her employment with police; along with injury and
associated complex, chronic pain and the development of depression as a
of these additive factors. The depression and pain impacted all aspects of her
life and lifestyle as evidenced by the rapid
loss of function within the first
12 months since injury, a trajectory that has continued over the ensuing years.
[The applicant]
had managed to live and function with her complex PTSD until the
physical injury in 2019 rendered her feeling helpless and vulnerable
which she could no longer reasonably escape due to her impairments. This was the
turning point when [the applicant] withdrew
socially and was unable to return to
her usual activity, exercise and work commitments. As such, the solution to the
weight gain
I believe is also multifactorial. As to his assertions about her
Indigenous heritage and genetic factors, I cannot substantiate his
comments but
would note that [the applicant] resides in a regional town and has not led a
traditional rural/remote lifestyle or regularIy
consumed a traditional diet in
her lifetime.”
(v) concluded:
“I concur that the development of obesity for [the applicant] is
multifactorial. While [the applicant] was overweight prior
to the onset of her
physical and psychological injury, I do not believe [the applicant] would have
become obese had these injuries
not occurred, as the symptoms of illness and the
treatments are both associated with a reduction in activity and changes to usual
routine, including diet and exercise.”
(ff) on 9 June 2025, Dr Laurence McEntee, orthopaedic spine surgeon:
(i) recorded a history that he initially reviewed the applicant in 2021 in
relation to her significant ongoing low back pain following
the lumbar spine
injury, and at that time they agreed that the mainstay treatment should be
physiotherapy, exercise and weight loss
and he suggested that the applicant be
referred to a bariatric surgeon for consideration of bariatric surgery to aid
with her weight
(ii) stated that when he reviewed the applicant on 19 December 2023, she had
lost 35kg post her bariatric surgery and felt that she
had more movement through
her low back but no reduction in pain, still struggled with post-traumatic
stress disorder and depression
for which she was receiving treatment;
(iii) stated that when he reviewed the applicant on 13 May 2024, the MRI showed
ongoing disc degeneration L3/4 and L4/5, but not
disc protrusions or nerve
compression, and the applicant reported ongoing low back pain with what sounded
like a significant facet
joint contributin with further review of imaging
confirming facet arthropathy bilaterally at L4/5 and L5/S1, and he suggested
radiofrequency
ablations of her L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints;
(iv) diagnosed chronic low back pain with contributions from disc degeneration
and facet arthropathy, with the initial injuries sustained
in the course of
employment;
(v) stated that the recommended bilateral L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joint
radiofrequency ablations is more of a procedure than a surgery
placement of needles under image guidance into the lumbar spine, and it involves
thermal denervation of the medial branch
nerves supplying the L4/5 and L5/S1
facet joints and can be an effective treatment for facet joint mediated low back
(vi) stated that the applicant’s work-related injuries were significant
initiating factors in the development of the applicant’s
chronic low back
pain, which has also likely been contributed to by the facet joint arthropathy,
and therefore the need for treatment
can be related to the applicant’s
work injuries;
(vii) stated that the treatment is appropriate and reasonably necessary
treatment for facet joint mediated low back pain;
(viii) stated that other alternatives would include CT guided local anaesthetic
and steroid injections into the joints, however radiofrequency
treatment tends to give a more prolonged treatment frame;
(ix) stated that if the treatment leads to a significant improvement in the
applicant’s back pain then it would be considered
cost effective;
(x) stated that radiofrequency ablation of the lumbar facet joints is considered
an appropriate treatment for facet mediated low
back pain and the aim of the
treatment is to reduce the applicant’s low back pain;
(xi) stated that he would expect radiofrequency ablation of the lumbar facet
joints to lead to a reduction in the applicant’s
back pain, although he
would not expect a complete elimination of her pain;
(xii) agreed that the applicant did require metabolic surgery to assist with the
morbid obesity state that has occurred after her
work injury;
(xiii) agreed that the bariatric surgery was a “very reasonable
treatment”, stating that “Whilst the need for the
bariatric surgery
is not directly related to her work injury, the work injury led to significant
reduction in physical activity as
well as the use of opiate medications, both of
which contributed to significant weight gain and therefore the need for the
(xiv) stated that:
“Whilst [the applicant] may have been overweight prior to her work
injuries, it's my understanding she gained a further significant
weight post the work injuries. It's my understanding that her obesity prior to
the work injuries would not have been at
a level that required bariatric
surgery, but significant weight gain post the work injuries resulted in her
obesity getting to a
level where bariatric surgery was appropriate.”
(gg) on 2 July 2024, Dr Gratian Punch:
(i) detailed various benefits of bariatric surgery;
(ii) stated that he cannot wholly agreed with the opinion of Dr Verma in his
report dated 1 November 2024;
(iii) stated that the sleeve gastrectomy was undertaken because it was indicated
by the applicant’s BMI, an also in a bid to
assist and improve the ability
of outcome in back pain and spinal surgery, noting that the lumbar spine injury
likely caused the
applicant’s back pain, which may have exacerbated a
pre-existing obesity state, resulting in an increase up the class of morbid
obesity scale;
(iv) stated that the loss of physical activity to reduce obese impacts would be
a cause of the increase from class II to class III
metabolic state and therefore
the highest recorded BMI of the applicant to date;
(v) stated that it is clear from the report by Dr Kim Edwards dated
November 2024 that the recorded weight of the applicant fluctuated significantly
between 2003 and 2018, however the applicant’s
weight stopped fluctuating
at the time of the work-related back pain incident on 9 May 2019 and then only
steadily increased. Dr
Punch noted that the applicant’s highest previous
recorded BMI was 44 kg/m2 prior to the injury. He stated that, whilst the
obesity may have predated the workplace injury, the scale of the morbid class
III obesity severity worsened after injury to a BMI
of at least 48 kg/m2 and
even potentially BMI 54 kg/m2 in February 2023. Dr Punch stated that the
workplace injury with subsequent
loss of ability to participate in physical
activity would be the causal association for this worsening in class III morbid
(vi) disagreed with the opinion of Dr Cochrane;
(vii) stated that:
“- there is a causal relationship between the work related injury of 9
May 2019 and the loss of fluctuation in [the applicant’s]
weight. It is
clear she could not participate in physical activity to rectify her metabolic
challenges.
- there is a clear worsening of the class II obese state of [the applicant]
after the work related to injury of 9 May 2019 to a class
III morbidly obese
metabolic state and it is likely that EML would be liable for this change.
- I do not agree
with the opinion of Dr Verma with regard to the significant cultural aspects of
the case - I struggle with using
these multifactorial aspects of weight gain as
the main cause as it seems to diminish the impact of back pain on creating
lifestyle based on pain. I am worried there is a chance that [the
applicant] is facing Weight stigma prejudice in this setting not
only on her
BMI, but due to cultural dislocation and dispersion as well.
- I am concerned
for the opinion of Dr Verma and Dr Cochrane with regard to their understandings
of the particulars of MBS surgery,
as they state their opinion based on Rebecca
having a gastric bank surgery. In fact she did not have that operation. Rebecca
a laparoscopic Gastric Sleeve surgery.”
(viii) stated that current nonsurgical treatment options for patients with BMI
greater than 35 kg/m2 are ineffective in achieving
a substantial and sustained
weight reduction necessary to significantly improve their health;
(ix) expressed the opinion that it is entirely reasonable for the applicant to
undergo weight loss surgery in order to facilitate
the procedure recommended by
Professor McEntee;
(x) stated that:
“The ability to manage weight issues was present to the work related
injury, this was lost after 9 May 2019. As previously stated
class I and II
obesity was present and this was managed. It was after the work related injury
that the Class III morbid obesity occurred
and was not able to be managed due to
loss of physical activity.”
(hh) on 14 September 2025, Dr Laurence McEntee, orthopaedic spine surgeon:
(i) in response to Dr Edwards report dated 11 August 2025, stated that the
applicant continues to suffer chronic back pain with clinically
a facet joint
component and imaging confirming changes in the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joints;
(ii) confirmed his opinion that the applicant would benefit from the lumbar
spine procedure, noting that it significantly reduces
pain in the short term in
the setting of facet joint pathology;
(iii) stated that the lumbar spine procedure would not necessarily be a
permanent fix and may not lead to any long-term improvement
applicant’s symptoms, but that it may well give the applicant significant
pain relief for six to twelve months and allow
her to rehabilitate more
effectively, and the procedure can be repeated multiple times, which would lead
to long-term overall improvement
in the applicant’s symptoms, and
(iv) expressed the opinion that the lumbar spine injury likely contributed to
the applicant’s weight gain, noting that s with
chronic low back pain, the
applicant had been less able to be active and to exercise and that has almost
certainly contributed to
her weight gain.
(ii) on 19 September 2025, Dr Gratian Punch:
(i) expressly disagreed with the Dr Edwards opinion contained in his report
dated 11 August 2025;
(ii) stated that the highest BMI occurred after the lumbar spine injury and that
it is known that back pain can cause weight gain,
in this case, increasing the
morbidity and mortality risk to the applicant by increasing the obesity state
from Class to II Class
III morbid obesity;
(iii) stated that the cause of the worsening increase in the applicant’s
obesity is related to the lumbar spine injury in accordance
with published
literature;
(iv) stated that weight gain may occur because of chronic pain, which is one of
the major reasons that obese patients list for their
weight gain, noting that
frustration associated with functional limitation may lead to overeating, and
other adverse effects of chronic
pain, such as sedentary lifestyle, poor sleep,
and side effects of medication, may also contribute to weight gain in chronic
(v) stated that obesity is known to have various adverse impacts on people's
functional capacity and quality of life in general,
and when obesity co-occurs
with chronic pain, obesity may have further health consequences for chronic pain
patients. Dr Punch stated
that several studies have shown reduced life
expectancy for individuals with chronic pain, mostly due to cardiovascular
Dr Punch stated that although the exact mechanism underlying the
increased mortality in chronic pain patients is not known, it has
been suggested
that metabolic syndrome is common in chronic pain patients, and that it may lead
to compromised cardiac health. Dr
Punch stated that overall research suggests
that obesity makes chronic pain more problematic in general because obesity is
to greater physical disability and psychological distress in chronic
pain patients and, compared to non- obese patients, obese back
pain patients
appear to be more functionally impaired, have greater comorbid problems, and
have more radicular symptoms than non-obese
patients, and
(vi) expressed the opinion that the sleeve gastrectomy was reasonably necessary
in a bid to assist the applicant with a plan and
pathway for return to work as
outlined in published literature.
Evidence of costs
evidence included a Schedule of treatment expenses with receipts and estimated
future costs.
costs of the lumbar spine procedure included: Professor McEntee estimated fees
for the lumbar spine procedure of $2,540;
Pindara Private Hospital estimated
total accommodation and theatre fees of $2,201.17, and Southport Anaesthetists
estimated anaesthesia
fees of $1,550.
Independent medical
Dr Neil Cochrane, neurosurgeon, independent medical expert qualified by
the respondent
Cochrane provided evidence by way of several reports.
a report dated 19 August 2019, Dr Cochrane:
(a) reported on his assessment of the applicant on 19 August 2019;
(b) agreed with Professor McEntee that it is very reasonable to proceed to
denervation of the facets at L4/5 and L5/S1 by means of
a facet joint
radiofrequency neurotomy procedure, noting that it is a reasonable treatment
option for aggravated facet arthropathy
in the lumbar spine, and particularly
for the applicant who suffered non-resolved aggravation lumbar spondylosis in a
facet arthropathy in the lumbar spine injury;
(c) agreed with Professor McEntee that such procedure would be highly preferable
to surgery with a more predictable outcome, lower
morbidity and less of a
psychological challenge to a patient who has a significant current psychological
injury or condition;
(d) did not believe that any alternative treatment would be likely to assist the
applicant prior to surgery as there is probably
no alternative treatment that is
applicable, noting that the applicant has already undergone bariatric surgery,
undertaken or attempted
to undertake a rehabilitation and strengthening
programme to the low back and, in his view, is not a candidate for surgery due
her raised body mass index, her substantial psychological injury or
condition, his assessment of significant urinary dysfunction
greatly in excess
of what radiological imaging would suggest or anticipate, and the fact that
surgery would, in his opinion, for
the greater part, be treating the underlying
degenerative condition as opposed to the work-related injury;
(e) expressed the opinion that the lumbar spine procedure would result in a
modest reduction in the applicant’s back pain and
improved quality of
living, but would be unlikely to result in any substantial functional
improvement that would allow the applicant
to return to work;
(f) noted that he is not a bariatric surgeon, but rather a neurosurgeon and it
is not appropriate or reasonable for him to provide
comment on the intricacies
of bariatric surgery;
(g) stated that after reading the report of Dr Gratian Punch dated 2 July 2025,
he understood that there was some notable increase
in the applicant’s
obesity in the sense of measured BMI after the time of the work injury and that
Dr Punch felt that was a
reasonable indication for treatment;
(h) stated that it appears that the applicant’s weight increased after the
lumbar spine injury, however he found it difficult
to accept that it was
causally associated with the lumbar spine injury as opposed to, for example,
other lifestyle issues, psychological
distress or a psychological condition,
(i) expressed the opinion that, whilst bariatric surgery was a very reasonable
treatment option to assist the injured worker in her
general health and activity
levels, it was not clearly causally indicated as a result of the lumbar spine
injury given that: significant
obesity clearly predated the accident; and, in
his view, bariatric surgery was considered of low likelihood to improve the
worker's spinal condition due to other confounding factors such as
underlying degenerative condition and her psychological injury
or condition.
a report dated 26 September 2019, Dr Cochrane:
(a) expressed the opinion that that the applicant is suffering the effects of
multi-level lumbar spondylosis and has likely suffered
temporary aggravations of
the workplace, however any work-related aggravations would likely have been
temporary and maximally of
two months’ duration.
a report dated 16 March 2020, Dr Cochrane:
(a) expressed the opinion that there were other non-work-related factors
contributing to the applicant’s pain, including but
not limited to her
mental health and the underlying degenerative disorder in the lumbar spine.
a report dated 23 February 2023, Dr Cochrane:
(a) reported on his assessment of the applicant on 23 January 2023;
(b) recorded a reported history that the applicant took various medication and
experiencing ongoing substantial low back pain; and
had sustained significant
weight gain which she attributed to the lumbar spine injury and consequential
lack of mobility; reported
her current weight was 122kg which equated to a BMI
of 43.7 and falling in the Class III range of obesity;
(c) reported that, on examination, the applicant demonstrated
asymmetrically-restricted lumbar movements without evidence of radiculopathy
a low mood state, which was suggestive of a depressive mood;
(d) expressed the opinion that, as a result of the nature of activities in the
workplace, the applicant has sustained aggravation
of lumbar spondylosis, and
that there had been minimal recovery since his initial assessment of the
applicant in August 2019;
(e) diagnosed “a non-resolved aggravation of lumbar spondylosis for this
significant chronic or central pain phenomenon or
central sensitisation
syndrome, and apparently significant psychological injury”;
(f) expressed the opinion that the applicant’s asymmetrically-restricted
lumbar movements are attributable to the nature and
activity of work events
between January 2019 and May 2019, and he assessed 7% whole person impairment on
that basis.
a report dated 30 March 2023, Dr Cochrane:
(a) expressed the opinion that the applicant suffered a work-related aggravation
of pre-existing underlying, degenerative and constitutional
condition of lumbar
spondylosis at multiple levels of disc degeneration although of a mild degree
mainly at L3/4 and L4/5 levels;
(b) expressed the opinion that there was no significant neural compressive
lesion and mild disc height collapse as seen on MRI scan
(August 2019), that
there is a significant secondary or chronic central pain syndrome that has
evolved and what appears to be a significant
psychological injury with a low
mood state;
(c) expressed the opinion that there is no role for surgery, because the
applicant’s apparent significant secondary psychological
injury, pain
behaviour and chronic central pain syndrome would represent a barrier and in
fact relative contraindication to structural
spinal surgery, and
(d) stated that the applicant would be a candidate for a multidisciplinary pain
management program and rehabilitation program and
possibly may be a candidate
for intervention from a pain specialist including but not limited to spinal cord
stimulation.
a report dated 4 April 2025, Dr Cochrane:
(a) stated that the applicant reported three types of ongoing low back pain,
which ranged in intensity between 2/10 and 8/10: peak
pain described as pain
around the lumbosacral junction, which was “dull and guttural” pain;
muscle contractional spasm
episodes, which can be more severe; and “nerve
pain,” associated with the lumbosacral junction, which ascended up through
the spine towards the neck and skull base, occasionally descended to sciatica
bilaterally to the back of both knees;
(b) stated that the applicant described various functional limitations as a
result of the ongoing symptoms;
(c) reported that on examination, the applicant demonstrated various pain
symptoms and limitations in movement involving the lumbar
(d) reported that the applicant presented with extremely diminished lumbar
spinal movements with significant functional restriction,
which are grossly in
excess of what have been anticipated with modest radiological findings, and what
he interpreted to be significant
functional overlay, sub-maximal effort and
likely symptom magnification;
(e) queried whether the applicant’s significant psychological disorder was
impacting upon the applicant’s presentation;
(f) stated that it appears that the reported nature and activities at the
workplace have resulted in a muscular ligamentous strain
applicant’s lumbar spine, with an aggravation of previously asymptomatic
lumbar spondylosis, admittedly of a mild degree
radiologically;
(g) stated that he suspected that the applicant has, in addition to a
non-resolved aggravation of lumbar spondylosis sustained in
the workplace
described as occurring on 9 May 2019, a significant and disabling chronic pain
disorder, noting that there had been
negligible recovery and the applicant
presented as totally and permanently disabled;
(h) diagnosed a non-resolved aggravation of lumbar spondylosis and likely
resolved muscular ligamentous strain to the lumbar spine,
and stated that the
applicant also appears to have developed a significant chronic pain disorder or
central pain disorder, which
is likely impacting upon the presentation;
(i) expressed the opinion that the lumbar spine injury caused both an
aggravation and probable acceleration of underlying degenerative
disc disease at
the L3/4 and L4/5 levels consistent with radiologic findings, and that it was
also a substantial contributing factor
to the development of the
applicant’s pain, albeit now far in excess of what one would
anticipate;
(j) expressed the opinion that, whilst there was a degree of symptom
magnification and disability in excess of what one would predict
physical injury, he could not conclude that the applicant was exaggerating or
feigning her presentation, noting that symptom
magnification can be
multifactorial and the applicant’s psychological condition or injuries may
be impacting upon the physical
presentation;
(k) expressed the opinion that, having assessed the applicant and being unable
to determine radiculopathy, and noting absence of
convincing neurocompressive
lesion on detailed spinal imaging, there is no role for spinal surgical
intervention to the applicant;
(l) stated that the applicant had undergone treatment for the lumbar spinal
injury, which included periods of physiotherapy and consumption
medications;
(m) recorded that the applicant reported that since undergoing bariatric surgery
in around May 2023, she had lost an estimated 50kg
and presently weighed 101kg,
she had ongoing back pain however her mobility and overall personal hygiene had
improved as a result
of her weight loss;
(n) stated that gastric band or gastric sleeve surgery was not directly related
to the applicant’s reported lumbar spine injury,
although it was a very
reasonable treatment modality to minimise a significantly raised body mass index
to aid her mobility and ability
to actively engage in rehabilitation efforts,
and minimise the impact of the applicant’s reported lumbar spine injury,
it had not been associated with any functional benefit nor significant
reduction in spinal pain overall;
(o) noted treating medical evidence regarding fluctuations in the
applicant’s weight at various times between 2008 and 2018,
and expressed
the opinion that the applicant had significant weight issues predating the onset
of any physical or psychological injury,
(p) noting that he is a neurosurgeon, and not an expert in bariatric surgery nor
the clear indications for such surgery, agreed with
the opinions of Dr Edwards
Dr Verma that there was no clear causal connection between the lumbar
spine injury and the applicant’s obesity and need for
laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy.
Dr Kim Edwards, surgeon, independent medical expert qualified by the
a report dated 26 April 2023, Dr Edwards:
(a) recorded a reported history which included that “over the
years”, the applicant had put on weight, and she believed
that prior to
the lumbar spine injury she weighed 97kg, (although elsewhere in the report it
recorded that the applicant thought
her weight at about the time medication was
started in around 2013 may have been 85kg) and that her weight later increased
dietician and was prescribed Saxenda, which the respondent’s
insurer had
paid for, which resulted in a 10kg weight loss. The applicant reported that a
bariatric surgeon suggested she undergo
sleeve gastrectomy surgery, which she
believed would cause her to lose weight and enable lumbar spine surgery, which
would significantly
decrease pain;
(b) expressed the opinion that the applicant’s class 2 obesity was most
likely due to her caloric intake, although he noted
that some drugs can
contribute to weight gain;
(c) stated that certain medical literature made the following points in relation
to the causes of obesity:
(i) obesity develops when excess energy is stored as fat. Most human obesity is
associated with increased food intake rather than
reduced energy expenditure;
(ii) the fundamental cause is a change in environment with easy availability of
energy dense foods and reduced opportunities for
physical activity;
(iii) the development of obesity in the modern environment is most likely in
those with increased genetic susceptibility;
(iv) single gene defects causing obesity are rare, but demonstrate the
importance of appetite-regulating pathways in control of human
energy balance.
Many genes may contribute to the susceptibility of individuals to obesity;
(v) other causes include drugs that affect appetite and damage to appetite
regulating areas of the brain”
(my emphasis), and
(d) stated that if the applicant were to undergo a sleeve gastrectomy, it would
be expected that she would lose significant weight.
a report dated 25 November 2024, Dr Edwards:
(a) reported that the applicant stated that: she underwent a self-funded sleeve
gastrectomy, performed by Dr Punch at Lismore Private
Hospital on
2023, that she thought that she was around 139kg at the time of the operation
and that she now weighed 101kg; she was disappointed
that her back pain had not
diminished and is no better; however, she was pleased that she no longer has
sleep apnoea and she is more
(b) diagnosed back pain which represented a disease condition of constitutional
origin due to underlying degenerative changes in
her lumbar spine, and that any
symptomatic aggravation which may have been caused by the applicant’s work
in 2019 no longer
has any effect, and the applicant’s symptoms are
attributable to non-work related injury and pre-existing conditions;
(c) expressed the opinion that the sleeve gastrectomy was not reasonably
necessary as a result of any work related injury or any
consequential injury,
noting that the applicant had tried other treatments for weight loss which were
partially successful;
(d) noted the applicant’s history of weight at various times which were
recorded by her treating general practitioner and included:
(i) on 4 December 2003, the applicant enquired about weight loss treatment and
exercise and diet were suggested;
(ii) on 24 March 2004, the applicant had lost 10kg;
(iii) on 14 September 2004, the applicant’s weight measured 110kg;
(iv) on 20 October 2010, it was noted that the applicant had lost 40kg as a
result of dieting;
(v) on 12 May 2011, the applicant’s weight was 102kg;
(vi) on 2 November 2011, the applicant’s weight was 100kg;
(vii) on 25 May 2012, the applicant enquired whether she could start seeing a
dietician and an exercise “scientist”;
(viii) on 20 May 2013, the applicant was worried about weight gain;
(ix) on 25 February 2015, the applicant’s weight measured 123kg, and the
applicant stated that she was struggling to lose weight
and this affected her
daily life;
(x) on 17 June 2015 the applicant’s weight was 109kg;
(xi) on 15 October 2016, the applicant’s weight was down to 96kg;
(xii) on 31 January 2018, the applicant’s weight measured 119kg;
(e) stated that the above history of the applicant’s weight pre-dating the
lumbar spine injury indicates that the applicant’s
obesity is not
connected to the lumbar spine injury;
(f) stated that the applicant has demonstrated an ability to lose weight with
dietary and medical measures, although she regained
the weight on most
(g) stated that the applicant’s history indicates that she has long had
problems with weight gain, she could lose weight when
she undertook various
dietary measures, and on occasions aided by medication, and
(h) expressed the opinion that he “does not consider that it can be
definitively stated that [the applicant’s] weight
issues are due to her
work related psychological or physical injuries” and, further, that he
does not consider that the applicant’s
need for sleeve gastrectomy is
related to the psychological injury nor the lumbar spine injury.
a report dated 11 August 2025, Dr Edwards:
(a) stated that the lumbar spine procedure would likely not result in any long
term improvement of the applicant’s symptoms,
as is a possible temporising
treatment, and he did not consider it necessary, but rather a possible source of
temporary help;
(b) suggested that an opinion be obtained from a pain management specialist,
(c) expressed the opinion that the applicant’s weight gain had not been
accelerated by her injuries as obesity had been a long-term
Dr Surabhi Verma, psychiatrist, independent medical expert, qualified by
the respondent
2020 and 2021, Dr Surabhi Verma, psychiatrist, provided several reports to the
respondent’s insurer, in relation to the applicant’s
psychological
condition. Dr Verma diagnosed depressive disorder due to another medical
condition. Dr Verma expressed the opinion
that the applicant’s mental
health is intricately linked to her physical health.
1 November 2024, Dr Verma:
(a) recorded a reported history that the applicant initially weighed around 150
kg and that, since bariatric surgery in May 2023,
the applicant had lost 52kg,
and that she now finds it easier to move but is restricted by back pain;
(b) stated that:
“I have noted that [the applicant] was overweight even before the onset
of her mental health symptoms and had been talking about
weight loss treatment
and programmes since 2004; however, her weight gradually increased and she said
that at its peak, her weight
was around 150 kg and had lost about 50 kg after
the weight loss surgery. I opined that there is not one factor that could have
and caused obesity, as there are multiple overlapping factors that
can cause obesity, especially in the Aboriginal population. I
believe that the
causative factors especially relevant for Ms Couch’s aboriginal background
include historical and intergenerational
trauma, food insecurity and limited
access to traditional foods.
Other factors include:
Sedentary Lifestyle: Shifts from a traditional physically demanding lifestyle
towards a more sedentary lifestyle also contributed
to lower physical activity,
leading to weight gain.
Mental Health and Stress: I believe that mental health and stress is one of
the many causative factors for weight gain often leading
to emotional eating and
coping behaviours that contribute to obesity.
Genetic Factors: Some genetic predisposition within the aboriginal
population, along with the Western diet, increases the susceptibility
I do not believe that her psychological condition was the only cause for her
weight issues; however, like in most other cases, obesity
is multifactorial in
origin, and the same could be said for [the applicant] as well”, and
(c) stated:
“I do not believe that it would be reasonable to ascribe [the
applicant’s] need for gastric band surgery in relation to
psychological condition. As mentioned above, obesity is multifactorial in origin
and as noted from the documentations received,
[the applicant] had weight gain
even before the onset of her mental health issues.
I agree with Dr Kim Edwards’ report dated 26 April 2023 that:
‘I do not believe it is possible to definitively state there is a
causal connection between the workplace injury on 9 May 2019
and her Class 2
obesity, and the need for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Therefore, I am
unable to say that EML is liable for
the requested laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy and treatment of her obesity.’”
Dr Frank Chow, psychiatrist, independent medical expert qualified by the
Chow gave evidence by way of two reports, respectively dated 11 December 2021
26 April 2022. Dr Chow:
(a) recorded a reported history which included various treatments for the
psychological injury, including various inpatient and outpatient
psychological
and psychiatric treatments and psychotropic medications, and also various
treatments for the lumbar spine injury, including
physiotherapy, hydrotherapy,
self-funded acupuncture and treating by a pain specialist and a pain
psychologist, and
(b) stated that the applicant has continued to suffer a chronic post-traumatic
stress disorder since 2013 and that the whole clinical
picture very much relates
to her underlying psychiatric condition.

behalf of the applicant, Mr Hammond:
(a) submitted that the sleeve gastrectomy was to assist the applicant to lose
weight which had been caused by medication she was
required to take to treat the
psychological injury and also by inactivity caused by the lumbar spine
(b) any weight issues which the applicant may have had prior to the
psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury, became worse
because of those
(c) the sleeve gastrectomy is to assist the applicant to lose weight, which will
also assist management of symptoms of the lumbar
spine injury. On that basis,
the applicant does not need to prove that obesity is a consequential condition
of the psychological
injury and the lumbar spine injury;
(d) referred me to various evidence in support of his submissions that the
sleeve gastrectomy and lumbar spine surgery is reasonably
necessary as a result
of the psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury, and
(e) submitted that considering the evidence as a whole, the Commission should be
satisfied that the sleeve gastrectomy and the lumbar
spine procedure is
reasonably necessary as a result of the psychological injury and the lumbar
spine injury, consistent with accepted
behalf of the respondent, Mr Gaitanis:
(a) referred me to various evidence in support of his submissions that the
sleeve gastrectomy and lumbar spine surgery is not reasonably
necessary as a
result of the psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury;
(b) submitted that the evidence demonstrates that the applicant’s back
pain did not diminish following the sleeve gastrectomy
and consequently the
Commission cannot be satisfied that the sleeve gastrectomy was reasonably
necessary as a result of the lumbar
spine injury;
(c) submitted that the lumbar spine injury pathology and symptoms was
effectively benign, with the applicant’s presentation
being grossly
disproportionate to the radiological findings, and did not require the sleeve
gastrectomy;
(d) submitted that prior to the psychological injury and the lumbar spine
injury, the applicant had a significant history of obesity
and weight loss
including with assistance of appetite supressing medication, Duromine, (with her
weight varying approximately 35kg,
from 94.7kg to 129.3kg) which is evidence
that the applicant’s weight gain is not caused by the psychological injury
lumbar spine injury and also that the applicant had the capacity to lose
weight without a sleeve gastrectomy;
(e) submitted that the applicant paid for elective sleeve gastrectomy, which
indicates that her motivations were personal and unrelated
to the psychological
injury and the lumbar spine injury;
(f) submitted that Dr Punch’s report of 2 July 2025 was premised on the
basis that the applicant’s weight was 150kg,
however there is no
contemporaneous evidence that the applicant’s weight did reach 150kg;
(g) submitted that alternative treatments to assist the applicant to achieve
weight loss were not considered nor exhausted;
(h) submitted that alternative treatments to treat the applicant’s lumbar
spine injury were not considered nor exhausted, and
there was no opinion from a
pain management specialist, and
(i) submitted that considering the evidence as a whole, the Commission should
not be satisfied that the sleeve gastrectomy and the
lumbar spine procedure is
reasonably necessary as a result of the psychological injury and the lumbar
spine injury.
submissions in reply, Mr Hammond:
(a) referred me to various evidence and case law in support of the
applicant’s case;
(b) submitted that the aim of the sleeve gastrectomy was to reduce the
applicant’s lumbar spine pain, and the fact that it
was of no or only
limited benefit is not conclusive of whether it was reasonably necessary;
(c) submitted that it is not relevant that there was relatively minor pathology
as pain and dysfunction can nevertheless be significant,

reasonableness, include, but are not necessarily

is certainly not determinative. The evidence may show that the same outcome
could be achieved by a different
treatment, but at a much lower cost. Similarly,

FINDINGS AND REASONS
Credibility of the applicant’s evidence
was no application for leave to cross-examine the applicant and there is no
evidence which directly challenges the credibility
of the applicant’s
applicant’s evidence is generally consistent with the treating medical
evidence and history recorded by medical specialists.
Considering
the evidence as a whole, I accept that the applicant’s evidence is her

The sleeve gastrectomy
Is the proposed treatment medical or related treatment?
applicant underwent the sleeve gastrectomy performed by Dr Gratian Punch
22 May 2023 by way of elective surgery.
sleeve gastrectomy is clearly “medical or related treatment (other than
domestic assistance)” within the meaning of
s 60(1)(a) of the 1987
Appropriateness
applicant’s evidence is that on 16 February 2023, about three months prior
to the sleeve gastrectomy being performed on
22 May 2023, she weighed around
treating surgeon, Dr Gratian Punch stated that the applicant reached her highest
recorded BMI following the lumbar spine injury,
of at least BMI 48 kg/m2, and
even potentially BMI 54 kg/m2 in February 2023 and that she reached class III
morbid obesity state.
consider that as the treating surgeon who performed the sleeve gastrectomy in
May 2023, I consider that Dr Punch was well placed
to have accurate information
regarding the applicant’s obesity stated at that time.
that reason, I accept Dr Punch’s evidence and I accept that the applicant
reached morbid obesity state prior to the sleeve
gastrectomy.
Punch gave evidence that morbid obesity is known to have various adverse impacts
on an individual’s function, capacity and
quality of life, and further
health consequences for chronic pain patients.
Punch expressed the opinion that the sleeve gastrectomy was reasonably necessary
in a bid to assist the applicant’s morbid
obesity state.
Considering
the applicant’s evidence and the treating medical evidence as a whole, I
accept that, particularly since the lumbar
spine injury, the applicant reached a
morbid obesity state.
I accept that the treating doctors, particularly the treating surgeon, was of
the opinion that the sleeve gastrectomy was
appropriate to treat the
applicant’s morbid obesity state.
Cost of the
applicant has provided evidence of the costs of and incidental to the sleeve
gastrectomy.
respondent has not raised any issue regarding the quantum of the costs of
treatment claimed by the applicant.
Availability of alternative
treatment and its effectiveness
applicant’s evidence and the treating medical evidence demonstrates that
on a number of occasions prior to the lumbar spine
injury, the applicant did
achieve weight loss with the assistance of her treating practitioners, including
weight loss medication.
applicant’s evidence is that, subsequent to the lumbar spine injury and
prior to undergoing the sleeve gastrectomy, she
achieved weight loss from 149kg
to around 135kg over a 12-month period, through treatment by Dr Jindabhai.
is clear that there is alternative treatment options available to the applicant,
which have a history of varied success in terms
of weight loss achieved and
weight loss sustained.
Edwards acknowledged that, whilst the applicant has demonstrated an ability to
lose weight with dietary and medical measures, she
regained the weight on most
treating surgeon, Dr Gratian Punch, stated that current nonsurgical options for
patients with BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 are ineffective
in achieving a
substantial and sustained weight reduction to significantly improve their
regard to the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied that there is any
alternative treatment which is demonstrated nor likely
to result in enduring
weight loss for the applicant.
Actual or potential effectiveness
of the treatment and acceptance by medical experts of the treatment
evidence of the applicant, which is consistent with what was reported by
Professor McEntee, is that between the sleeve gastrectomy
performed on 22 May
2023 and his review on 19 December 2023, the applicant had lost around 35 kg,
she felt that her pain had not
reduced however she no longer suffered sleep
apnoea and she had more movement in her low back.
the evidence demonstrates that the applicant’s back pain did not diminish
following the sleeve gastrectomy, I do not
accept that that necessitates a
finding that the sleeve gastrectomy was not reasonably necessary as a result of
the lumbar spine
accept that the sleeve gastrectomy was effective to enable the applicant to
achieve significant weight loss, of around 35kg between
May and December 2023.
By all accounts, that is the most weight loss that the applicant achieved at any
treating surgeon, Dr Gratian Punch, explained general benefits to the
applicant’s health that result from such significant
weight loss, which
would work towards ameliorating detrimental general health consequences caused
by a state of morbid obesity which,
arguably, was caused by the psychological
injury and the lumbar spine injury.
also accept that, whilst it resulted in significant weight loss, the sleeve
gastrectomy did not result in pain relief, the applicant
has experienced more
movement in her low back.
Does the need for the treatment arise
as a result of a work injury?
noted above, it is not in dispute that the applicant sustained the psychological
injury and the lumbar spine injury in the course
of her employment with the
respondent.
treating evidence consistently demonstrates that the applicant was treated with
various medications to treat the psychological
injury and the lumbar spine
is consistent medical evidence that some of those medications have the
propensity, in some people, to cause weight gain. As
noted by Dr Brook
Burchgartd, psychiatrist, these include Duloxetine and Venlafaxine.
is also consistent evidence that, subsequent to the lumbar spine injury, the
applicant was affected by significant ongoing pain
and loss of function.
do not accept the respondent’s submission that, because the applicant
self-funded the sleeve gastrectomy, that it should be
inferred that the sleeve
gastrectomy was undergone because of a personal desire of the applicant rather
than because it was reasonably
necessary as a result of the psychological injury
and the lumbar spine injury. There is considerable medical evidence which deals
with the causal relationship between the sleeve gastrectomy and the
psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury and the applicant
consistent evidence, which I accept, that she gained weight through inability
for activity and medication that she was prescribed
for treatment of the
psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury.
is consistent evidence that, subsequent to the lumbar spine injury, the
applicant was affected by significant ongoing pain and
loss of function.
Edwards, independent medical expert qualified by the respondent, expressed the
opinion that the applicant’s need for sleeve
gastrectomy is not related to
the psychological injury nor the lumbar spine injury. Dr Edwards opinion seems
to have been based,
at least in part, on his view that the applicant’s
back pain represented an underlying degenerative disease condition of
constitutional
origin, and that any symptomatic aggravation caused by the lumbar
spine injury no longer had effect and the applicant’s symptoms
attributable to non-work related injury and pre-existing conditions.
reasons that I give elsewhere in these reasons, I do not accept that premise. On
that basis, I accept that the applicant had,
and continues to have, ongoing pain
symptoms and restrictions resulting from the injury.
Verma, independent medical specialist qualified by the applicant, found no
causal connection between the sleeve gastrectomy and
the psychological injury
and the lumbar spine injury. I found Dr Verma’s report dated 1 November
2024, to be somewhat contradictory
and confusing. Dr Verma identified multiple
causal factors for the applicant’s obesity state which Dr Verma identified
“Mental Health and Stress: I believe that mental health and
stress is one of the many causative factors for weight gain often
emotional eating and coping behaviours that contribute to obesity” and
noted the applicant’s psychological
condition as one of multiple causal
factors. However, later in the report,
Dr Verma stated that it was not
possible to definitively state that there was a causal connection between the
applicant’s obesity
state and the physical injury.
applicant’s evidence is that she gained excess weight following the
psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury through
medication that she was
prescribed for treatment of the injuries and inability for activity.
treating evidence consistently demonstrates that the applicant was treated with
various medications to treat the psychological
injury and the lumbar spine
injury. Notably,
Dr Edwards did include a quote from medical literature
which noted that other causes of obesity “include drugs that affect
and damage to appetite regulating areas of the brain”.
is consistent medical evidence that some of those medications have the
propensity, in some people, to cause weight gain. As
noted by Dr Brook
Burchgartd, psychiatrist, these include Duloxetine and Venlafaxine.
Edwards also expressed the opinion that the history of the applicant’s
weight gain and weight loss in the years preceding
the lumbar spine injury
indicates that her obesity was a long-term problem and was not accelerated nor
causally connected to the
lumbar spine injury.
applicant stated that her weight had fluctuated a little bit prior to her
injuries but she was usually around 100kg in 2011 up
until around 2015 when her
weight fluctuated between 105 and 120kg.
his report dated 25 November 2024, Dr Edwards, independent medical expert
qualified by the respondent, summarised the treating
practitioner’s
records regarding the applicant’s weight history between 2003 and 2018,
which is generally consistent
with the treating medical evidence.
applicant’s evidence and the treating medical evidence consistently shows,
and I accept, that the applicant had a long history
of obesity and some
significant fluctuating weight loss and weight increases up until she sustained
the lumbar spine injury at the
commencement of 2019. As noted above, it does not
appear from the evidence that the applicant was able to achieve enduring weight
loss prior to the lumbar spine injury.
evidence does seem to consistently show that the applicant’s weight did
reach its highest point following the lumbar spine
applicant stated that her weight had reached about 149kg when she was first
treated for weight loss over a 12-month period by
Dr Jindabhai, and then, when
she subsequently attended Dr Punch on 16 February 2023, she weighed around 135kg
and was using a walking
is no contemporaneous treating evidence which supports the applicant’s
evidence that her weight reached a maximum of about
149kg following the
psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury, however that appears to have
been generally accepted by various
medical evidence, including Dr Verma and Dr
treating surgeon, Dr Gratian Punch did confirm that the applicant reached her
highest recorded BMI following the lumbar spine
injury, of at least BMI 48
kg/m2, and even potentially BMI 54 kg/m2 in February 2023. Dr Punch explained
that the sleeve gastrectomy
was undertaken because it was indicted by the
applicant’s BMI and also in a bid to assist and improve the ability and
of spinal surgery. Dr Punch opined that it is entirely reasonable for
the applicant to undergo the sleeve gastrectomy in order to
facilitate the
lumbar spine procedure. Dr Punch stated that the applicant had the ability to
manage her weight prior to the lumbar
spine injury in 2019 when class I obesity
and class II obesity was present, however that ability ceased with the effects
of the lumbar
spine injury. Dr Punch opined that the lumbar spine injury caused
the applicant’s back pain, and loss of physical activity
to reduce obese
impacts, which was the cause of a clear worsening of the increase up the scale
from class II obesity to morbid class
III obesity. Dr Punch noted that weight
gain may occur because of chronic pain and consequential functional limitations
adverse effects, such as sedentary lifestyle, poor sleep, and side
effects of medication.
Dr Punch also noted that overall research indicates
that obesity makes chronic pain more problematic because it is related to
physical disability, psychological distress and other comorbidities. Dr
Punch provided a detailed and considered explanation of the
basis for his
opinions, with various references to medical literature.
Brook Burchgardt, psychiatrist, accepted that the applicant’s weight gain
was multifactorial, however she also opined that
the lumbar spine injury was the
turning point when the applicant was no longer able to engage in her usual
activity, exercise and
work commitments and a marked reduction of activity, in
addition to the symptoms of illness and the treatments, which were the cause
the applicant’s increased obesity.
Considering
the evidence as a whole and particularly the matters I have set out above, I
prefer and accept the opinion of the applicant’s
treating surgeon, Dr
Gratian Punch, which I consider provides a carefully considered, sound, logical
and likely explanation for the
sleeve gastrectomy and its causal relationship
with both the psychological injury and the lumbar spine injury.
that basis, having considered the evidence in the context of the criteria
referred to in
, I am satisfied that the sleeve
gastrectomy was reasonably necessary as a result of the psychological injury and
the lumbar spine
The lumbar spine procedure
Is the proposed treatment medical or related treatment?
lumbar spine procedure is clearly “medical or related treatment (other
than domestic assistance)” within the meaning
of s 60(1)(a) of the 1987
Appropriateness
applicant’s evidence, which is consistent with treating medical evidence
and independent medical evidence, is that subsequent
to the lumbar spine injury,
she has continued to be affected by significant ongoing back pain and associated
loss of function of
her lower back.
2019 and 2024, in the context of her worsening low back pain and intermittent
flare ups of pain, the applicant underwent numerous
imaging of her lumbar spine
which consistently showed pathology involving the L4/5 and L5/S1:
(a) on 15 February 2019, a CT lumbar spine was reported to show: at the L4/5
disc, mild posterior and left lateral disc bulge, foraminal
stenosis on the left
side and obliteration of the fat plane around the exiting left L4 nerve root
consistent with nerve root impingement;
and at the L5/S1 disc, mild broad based
disc bulge, with mild degenerative arthritic changes noted in the S1 joints
bilaterally;
(b) on 3 May 2019, an MRI of the lumbar spine, was reported to show: moderate
reduction in disc height at L3/4 and L4/5 with minimal
reduction in height and
disc fluid signal at L5/S1, being mild lower lumbar/lumbosacral disc
degenerative change without focal protrusion
nor neurocompressive
complication;
(c) on 14 August 2019, an MRI lumbar spine, was reported to show: mild
degenerative disc disease at L4/5 and L3/4; a small disc osteophyte
the left posterolateral aspect of L4/5 contributing to mild to moderate left
neural foraminal narrowing; but no evidence
of significant compression of the
cauda equina or exiting nerve roots;
(d) on 4 August 2021, an MRI lumbar spine was reported to show: at L3/4 and L4/5
levels, reduced T2 hyperintensity in the nucleus
pulposus with mild diffuse disc
bulges which were suggestive of early degenerative changes; and at L1/2 level, a
small focal disc
protrusion, which was new compared to the previous MRI lumbar
spine on 14 August 2019; and
(e) on 22 January 2024, an MRI lumbar spine was reported to show: mild
multi-level degenerative changes and disc desiccation, most
marked at L3/4 and
L4/5, with no nerve compression.
9 June 2025, Professor Laurence McEntee, the applicant’s treating
orthopaedic spine surgeon stated that when he reviewed
the applicant on 13 May
2024, the MRI showed ongoing disc degeneration L3/4 and L4/5, but not disc
protrusions or nerve compression,
and the applicant reported ongoing low back
pain with what sounded like a significant facet joint contribution with further
of imaging confirming facet arthropathy bilaterally at L4/5 and L5/S1,
and he suggested radiofrequency ablations of her L4/5 and
L5/S1 facet joints.
Professor McEntee diagnosed chronic low back pain with contributions from disc
degeneration and facet arthropathy,
and he requested approval to proceed to the
lumbar spine procedure, being bilateral L4/5 and L5/S1 facet joint
radiofrequency ablations
as a day stay procedure at Pindara Private
McEntee explained that the lumbar spine procedure involves the placement of
needles under image guidance into the lumbar
spine, and it involves thermal
denervation of the medial branch nerves supplying the L4/5 and L5/S1 facet
McEntee stated that radiofrequency ablation of the lumbar facet joints is
considered an appropriate treatment for facet
mediated low back pain and the aim
of the treatment is to reduce the applicant’s low back pain.
that basis, I accept that the lumbar spine procedure is directed to treat the
pathology identified in the various imaging and the
applicant’s ongoing
lumbar spine symptoms.
Cost of the treatment
applicant has provided evidence of the costs of and incidental to the lumbar
spine procedure.
respondent has not raised any issue regarding the quantum of the costs of
treatment claimed by the applicant.
Availability of alternative
treatment and its effectiveness
medical evidence consistently shows that the applicant has undergone various
treatments for the lumbar spine injury, including
hydrotherapy, self-funded
acupuncture, physiotherapy and treatment by pain specialists.
20 February 2019, a CT-guided steroid injection of the left L4 nerve root to
treat the L4/5 disc bulge and left L4 nerve root impingement.
7 May 2019, the applicant was referred for treatment of the lumbar spine injury
under a Chronic Disease Management Plan in relation
to chronic back pain.
May 2019, Dr Chris Schwindack, neurosurgeon, recommended ongoing physiotherapy
and hydrotherapy.
the evidence indicates that those alternative treatments did not provide the
applicant with any enduring relief from the pain
and restrictions caused by the
lumbar spine injury.
McEntee stated that other alternatives to the lumbar spine procedure would
include CT guided local anaesthetic and steroid
injections into the joints,
however radiofrequency ablation treatment tends to give a more prolonged
treatment frame.
Cochrane, initially stated that the applicant would be a candidate for a
multidisciplinary pain management program and rehabilitation
program and
possibly may be a candidate for intervention from a pain specialist including
but not limited to spinal cord stimulation.
Cochrane agreed with Professor McEntee that the lumbar spine procedure would be
highly preferable to surgery with a more predictable
outcome, lower morbidity
and less of a psychological challenge to a patient who has a significant current
psychological injury or
condition. Dr Cochrane did not believe that any
alternative treatment would be likely to assist the applicant prior to surgery,
that the applicant has already undergone bariatric surgery, undertaken or
attempted to undertake a rehabilitation and strengthening
programme to the low
back and, in his view, is not a candidate for surgery due to her raised body
mass index, her substantial psychological
injury or condition, and his
assessment of significant urinary dysfunction greatly in excess of what
radiological imaging would suggest
or anticipate.
potential effectiveness of the treatment and acceptance by medical experts of
the treatment
medical evidence in relation to the potential effectiveness of the lumbar spine
procedure to address the applicant’s lumbar
spine symptoms and functional
limitations is somewhat difficult to reconcile.
Kim Edwards, surgeon, independent medical expert qualified by the respondent,
expressed the opinion that the lumbar spine procedure
would likely not result in
any long term improvement of the applicant’s symptoms, as is a possible
temporising treatment, and
he did not consider it necessary, but rather a
possible source of temporary help.
Laurence McEntee, the applicant’s treating orthopaedic spine surgeon,
stated that he would expect that the applicant
would benefit from the lumbar
spine procedure, noting that radiofrequency ablation of the lumbar facet joints
significantly reduces
pain in the short term in the setting of facet joint
McEntee acknowledged that he would not expect that the lumbar spine procedure
would provide a complete elimination of the
applicant’s pain and that is
would not necessarily be a permanent fix and may not lead to any long-term
improvement in the
applicant’s symptoms.
Professor McEntee stated that the lumbar spine procedure may well give the
applicant significant pain relief for six to twelve
months and allow her to
rehabilitate more effectively. He noted that the procedure can be repeated
multiple times, which would likely
lead to long-term overall improvement in the
applicant’s overall symptoms.
Neil Cochrane, neurosurgeon, independent medical expert qualified by the
respondent, agreed with Dr McEntee and expressed the opinion
that it is very
reasonable to proceed to the lumbar spine procedure, noting that it is a
reasonable treatment option for aggravated
facet arthropathy in the lumbar
spine, and particularly for the applicant who suffered non-resolved aggravation
lumbar spondylosis
in a particular facet arthropathy in the lumbar spine injury.
Cochrane initially expressed the opinion that the lumbar spine procedure would
result in a modest reduction in the applicant’s
back pain and improved
quality of living, although he acknowledged that it would be unlikely to result
in such substantial functional
improvement that would allow the applicant to
in a later a report dated 30 March 2023, Dr Cochrane expressed the opinion that
there was no significant neural compressive
lesion and mild disc height collapse
as seen on MRI scan in August 2019 and that there is a significant secondary or
chronic central
pain syndrome that has evolved and what appears to be a
significant psychological injury with a low mood state. On that basis, Dr
Cochrane expressed the opinion that there is no role for surgery, because he
considered that the applicant’s apparent significant
psychological injury, pain behaviour and chronic central pain syndrome would
represent a barrier and in fact relative contraindication
to structural spinal
a later report dated 4 April 2025, Dr Cochrane reported that, on examination,
the applicant demonstrated various pain symptoms
and extremely diminished lumbar
spinal movements with significant functional restriction, which are grossly in
excess of what have
been anticipated with modest radiological findings, and what
he interpreted to be significant functional overlay, sub-maximal effort
likely symptom magnification. Dr Cochrane queried whether the applicant’s
significant psychological disorder was impacting
upon her presentation. Dr
Cochrane expressed the opinion that, having assessed the applicant and being
unable to determine radiculopathy,
and noting absence of convincing
neurocompressive lesion on detailed spinal imaging, there is no role for spinal
surgical intervention
to the applicant.
found Dr Cochrane’s reports to be somewhat inconsistent and unclear.
Dr Cochrane did not address in any detail the nature of the lumbar
spine procedure and its potential to reduce pain in the short term.
balance, I prefer and accept the evidence of the applicant’s treating
neurosurgeon, Professor McEnree that the applicant
would likely benefit from the
lumbar spine procedure, noting that radiofrequency ablation of the lumbar facet
joints significantly
reduces pain in the short term in the setting of facet
joint pathology. Professor McEntee provided a carefully considered, sound,
logical and likely explanation for the lumbar spine procedure to treat the
lumbar spine injury.
considered the evidence in the context of the criteria referred to in
, I am satisfied that the lumbar spine procedure is
reasonably necessary to treat the applicant’s lumbar spine
Does the need for the treatment arise as a result of a
work injury?
noted above, it is not in dispute that the applicant sustained the lumbar spine
injury in the course of her employment with the
respondent.
noted above, I accept that the applicant has ongoing symptoms and restrictions
resulting from the injury.
9 June 2025, Professor Laurence McEntee, the applicant’s treating
orthopaedic spine surgeon reported that the applicant’s
work-related
injuries were significant initiating factors in the development of the
applicant’s chronic low back pain, which
has also likely been contributed
to by the facet joint arthropathy, and therefore the need for treatment can be
related to the applicant’s
work injuries.
Kim Edwards, surgeon, independent medical expert qualified by the respondent,
diagnosed back pain which represented a disease condition
of constitutional
origin due to underlying degenerative changes in her lumbar spine, and that any
symptomatic aggravation which may
have been caused by the applicant’s work
in 2019 no longer has any effect, and the applicant’s symptoms are
attributable
to non-work related injury and pre-existing conditions.
Cochrane, neurosurgeon, independent medical expert qualified by the applicant,
expressed the opinion that that the applicant is
suffering the effects of
multi-level lumbar spondylosis and has likely suffered temporary aggravations of
the workplace, however
any work-related aggravations would likely have been
temporary and maximally of two months’ duration. Dr Cochrane expressed
opinion that there were other non-work-related factors contributing to the
applicant’s pain, including but not limited
to her mental health and the
underlying degenerative disorder in the lumbar spine.
Dr Cochrane later diagnosed a non-resolved aggravation of lumbar spondylosis and
likely resolved muscular ligamentous strain
to the lumbar spine, and stated that
the applicant also appears to have developed a significant chronic pain disorder
pain disorder, which is likely impacting upon the presentation. Dr
Cochrane expressed the opinion that the lumbar spine injury caused
aggravation and probable acceleration of underlying degenerative disc disease at
the L3/4 and L4/5 levels consistent with
radiologic findings, and that it was
also a substantial contributing factor to the development of the
applicant’s pain, albeit
now far in excess of what one would anticipate.
Dr Cochrane expressed the opinion that, whilst there was a degree of symptom
magnification
and disability in excess of what one would predict from the
physical injury, he could not conclude that the applicant was exaggerating
feigning her presentation, noting that symptom magnification can be
multifactorial and the applicant’s psychological condition
or injuries may
be impacting upon the physical presentation.
found Dr Cochrane’s opinions to be somewhat inconsistent and unclear in
relation to whether the effects of the work-related
aggravation and acceleration
of the underlying degenerative disc disease at the L3/4 and L4/5 levels had
the reasons stated above, on balance, I prefer and accept the evidence of
Professor McEntee. Considering the evidence as a whole,
I am of the view that
his reports provide a reasoned and sensible explanation which is consistent with
the applicant’s evidence
and the treating evidence. Further, I am of the
view that it provides a logical and likely explanation for the applicant’s
ongoing symptoms and restrictions caused by the condition which is supported by
treating medical evidence, and I accept.
regard to my findings in relation to the injury above, I am satisfied that the
need for the lumbar spine procedure arises as
a result of the lumbar spine
that basis, the Commission finds:
(a) the sleeve gastrectomy was reasonably necessary as a result of the injury
pursuant to ss 59 and 60 of the 1987 Act, and
(b) the lumbar spine procedure is reasonably necessary as a result of the injury
pursuant to ss 59 and 60 of the 1987 Act.

(a) the respondent to pay the costs of and incidental to the sleeve gastrectomy,
pursuant to s 60 of the 1987 Act, and
