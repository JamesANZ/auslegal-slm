Oates, Janet Patricia (2022 TASCD 596), Responses [2022] TasCorCResp 2 (8 November 2022)
Response from Respect received 23 August 2023.
In response to the first recommendation, I recommend that all facilities using mobility hoists review their maintenance schedules
to ensure that they are serviced at intervals which are appropriate to detect and prevent failure of the components, the following
has occurred:
 Review of policy and process.
 Review of the preventative maintenance process indicated that monitoring of schedules could be improved, thus improvement has
been facilitated by the introduction of an electronic recording and monitoring system, replacing the previous paper-based system.
Following trial, this system is being rolled out throughout the organisation.
In response to the second recommendation, I recommend that technicians responsible for servicing mobility hoists use thread locking
adhesive (such as Loctite) and/or split pins to provide additional. security to critical, load-bearing nuts and bolts, the following
has occurred:
 Respect have consolidated service agreements for preventatve maintenance of hoists to have two service providers over three states.
Discussions with service providers has indicated that technicians are unwilling to make any changes to the manufactured structure
of hoists given that they may be accountable for liability of any failure. Additionally, warranties would be voided.
 To mitigate the risk of further incidents in addition to regular external annual service and checks the internal Respect maintenance
staff undertake monthly checks of all hoists with particular attention to nuts and bolts.
 Servicing of hoists continues to be undertaken as per the manufacturer’s recommendations..
