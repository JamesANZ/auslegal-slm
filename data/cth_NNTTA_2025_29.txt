REASONS FOR DISMISSAL
4 April 2025, the
of Western Australia gave notice under
Native Title Act
(Cth) of its intention to grant
prospecting licence P 51/3408-S to Vicki Margaret Stonham (the
notice included a statement that the State considers the grant of the
proposed licence to be an act attracting the expedited procedure
Native Title Act
(expedited procedure statement).
expedited procedure applies, the State may grant the proposed licence without
requiring parties to enter the right to negotiate
procedure pursuant to
Native Title Act
[3] The proposed
licence is located approximately 79 km in a south-easterly direction from
Meekatharra and covers an area of approximately
0.1 km². It is entirely
overlapped by the
Yugunga-Nya
People Part A native title determination
(WCD2021/0008), held in trust by the Yugunga-Nya Native Title Aboriginal
Corporation RNTBC
as the registered body corporate.
[4] On 9 April
2025, Yugunga-Nya lodged an objection to the State’s assertion that the
expedited procedure applies to the grant
of the licence with the National Native
. The objection application was lodged within the timeframe
outlined in
Native Title Act
and as such, under
the Tribunal is required to determine whether the grant of the proposed licence
is an act attracting the expedited procedure.
Relevant Facts
correspondence to the Tribunal dated 19 June 2025, the grantee stated its
preference for the matter to proceed to inquiry and
the matter was subsequently
referred to a directions hearing on 6 August 2025.
6 August 2025 I made directions requiring all parties to provide submissions to
the inquiry. Yugunga-Nya were directed to provide
contentions and evidence by 24
September 2025 however on the date of compliance, no submission was made by
Yugunga-Nya.
[7] On 1 October
2025, the Tribunal emailed all parties noting that Yugunga-Nya had failed to
comply with directions and that the
objection application was now at risk of
dismissal. Parties were provided until 8 October 2025 to make any comments and
for Yugunga-Nya
to seek an extension, however no response was received by this
Consideration of Dismissal
[8] Pursuant
Native Title Act
, the Tribunal may dismiss an
objection application at any stage of the inquiry in circumstances where the
native title party fails
within a reasonable time to proceed with the objection
application or to comply with a direction of the Tribunal. While the Tribunal
has broad discretion to dismiss an objection application, doing so has
significant consequences for the native title party and is
not an action taken
[9] The nature
of the expedited procedure and the principles relevant to consideration of
dismissal of an objection application for
failure to comply with directions are
set out in the Tribunal's decision in
Teelow v Page
([13]). I have
applied those principles in my consideration of this matter.
[10] On this
occasion, it is my view that Yugunga-Nya has been afforded sufficient
opportunity to progress this objection application
but have failed to do so
within a reasonable time.
[11] Having
regard to all of the facts and circumstances of this matter, I am satisfied that
the objection application should be
Determination
expedited procedure objection application in relation to prospecting licence P
51/3408-S is dismissed under
