REMARKS ON ADJOURNMENT
Panel has before it an application for review dated 18 May 2011, lodged by
solicitors acting for the applicant employer pursuant
(as it then
stood) of the
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
(“the Act”). The application seeks reviews of a series of
decisions of the respondent WorkCover Corporation of South Australia
(“WorkCover”) relating to levy assessments for the financial years
2000-2001 to 2009-2010 inclusive. From what I can
see in the files, the issue in
dispute relates to the proper industry classification to be applied to the
employer’s No.2 workplace
I have two files before me, each file appears to contain a copy of the same
application. It may be a case where the application
was lodged electronically
(or, under a more old-fashioned technology, by fax) and a hard copy arrived by
regular post a few days
later, and a second file was mistakenly made up. I do
not know. In any event, until one of the parties points out a distinction,
proceed on the basis there is one application.

section 72M.
Fortunately, there is no material difference between the two versions as relates
to the current application.

(3) The review will be conducted, in accordance with procedures determined
by the board, by the board itself, or by a committee or
person to whom the board
has delegated its powers of review under this section, and the board has an
absolute discretion as to whether
it will permit the employer or a
representative of the employer to be heard orally on the review.
(4) On review, the board may—
(aa) alter an estimate;
(a) alter a levy or an assessment;
(b) quash or reduce penalty interest or a fine;
(c) direct the repayment of amounts overpaid;
(d) quash or vary a condition imposed by the Corporation.
(5) An application under this section for review of a decision of the
Corporation—
(a) must, if the decision relates to a class of employer, be made within four
months after notice of the decision was given;
(b) must, if the decision relates to an individual employer, be made within
two months after the employer was given notice of the

Panel is the Board’s delegate under the section: for the current version
of the delegation, see
WorkCover Premium Review Panel Determination 2012

, 10 May 2012, p.1617). This
Determination provides that reviews of decisions prior to 1 July 2012 will
proceed under the revoked

, 29 October 2009, p.4977, for the
version that was current when the present application was lodged). Again, there
is no material
difference.
application has been under negotiation between the parties for quite a long
time. An agreed resolution has not proven possible,
and the application has been
referred to the Panel for hearing and decision.
the matter was called on for directions today, Mr Hayford appeared for the
respondent WorkCover. There was no attendance for
the applicant employer. With
the hindsight of 25 years’ experience in dealing with hearings involving
the employer’s
solicitor, Mr Walsh, I can only surmise some unusual
oversight in his office. Mr Walsh is very far indeed from being an habitual
offender in matters of attendance at hearings. I certainly do not take his
absence as an abandonment by his client of the application
for review. I am
confident that Mr Walsh would inform the registry if that were the case.
any event, in conformity with my consciousness that this is a no-costs
applicants’ legal costs, I directed WorkCover to prepare a book of
documents for reference at the full hearing before the Panel
and to send Mr
Walsh a draft list of its proposed contents, so any suggested additions may be
included. Mr Hayford thought that could
be done in about four weeks.
will also take this opportunity to remind the parties that this Panel does not
have the advantage of transcripts of hearings. Accordingly,
even where live
evidence is to be heard from witnesses, written witness statements, while not
compulsory, are greatly appreciated
and ideally can be included in the book of
documents. For the same reason, written outlines of argument are also welcome
ensure that parties’ submissions are understood properly by
members of the Panel.
will prepare four copies of the book of documents for members of the Panel and
additional copies for the parties’
use. In the event that a party needs to
hand up any document at the hearing, four copies will be necessary for the
Panel, and an
additional copy for the other
Further consideration of the employer’s application for review is
