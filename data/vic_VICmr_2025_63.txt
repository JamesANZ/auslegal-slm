Reasons for Decision
Background to review
Applicant made a request to the Agency seeking access to the following
All documents pertaining to:
- meetings or discussions (or any records, notes and agendas);
- agreements, donations, inducements, grants (and any other monetary
- submissions, papers or proposals to council (or considered at council
Relating to the Western Renewables Link or from [a third party].
The dates that are of interest are between [dates].
the clarification process for the FOI request, the Agency directed the Applicant
to certain documents which were accessible
on their website.
the remainder of documents, the Agency decided to apply section 25A(5), advising
that based on the terms outlined in the request,
it was evident that all
documents would be exempt. While the Agency’s decision letter did not
specify the exemption it relied
on, it is clear from their description of why
the documents would be exempt that it decided all documents would be exempt
under section
Review application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under section 49A(1) of
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section
49H(2) in relation to the review.
Initial view
staff provided the Agency with an initial view that it was likely section 25A(5)
did not apply to the request, as there was likely
information in the documents
that could not be categorised as section 30(1) material, could be released as
purely factual material
under section 30(3), and edited copies could be provided
to the Applicant. The Agency was invited to provide further submissions
consider making a fresh decision.
Agency disagreed with the initial view, and provided further information to
support its position.
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
Review of section 25A(5)
25A(5) provides an agency may refuse to grant access to documents without having
identified the documents falling within the
terms of the request if it is
apparent from the nature of the request that all the requested documents would
be exempt from release
under the FOI Act, and there is no obligation to provide
the applicant with partial access to one or more documents in accordance
section 25.
power in section 25A(5) is carefully circumscribed. A decision maker must be
satisfied of the following three elements, which
operate to limit its
application:
(a) First, the exempt nature of the documents must be objectively apparent from
the face of the request. Namely, the terms of the
request as described by the
applicant. The ‘nature’ of a document refers to its inherent or
essential quality or character.
(b) Second, it must be apparent all documents in the request are exempt.
(c) Third, it must be apparent from:
(i) the nature of the documents, as described in the request, that no obligation
would arise under section 25 for the agency to grant
access to an edited copy of
a document; or
(ii) the request or through consultation with the applicant that the person
would not wish to have access to an edited copy of the
25A(5) does not require an agency to identify any or all documents to which the
request relates or to specify, in respect
of each document, the relevant
exemption under which a document is claimed to be exempt.
Accordingly,
I am required to make my decision without having reviewed any of the requested
documents, and in the absence of confirming
whether any relevant documents may
actually exist.
First element – what is the essential
character of the documents?
Applicant is seeking access to a broad range of Council documents, relating to a
major infrastructure project..
am satisfied the nature of the requested documents is objectively apparent from
the specific terms of the Applicant’s request.
Accordingly, I am satisfied
the first limb of section 25A(5) is met.
Second element –
would all documents, as described in the request, be exempt from
refusing access under section 25A(5), without having identified any or all of
the documents sought, the Agency determined it was
apparent that all of the
requested documents sought, should any exist, would be exempt from release under
section 30(1).
its response to OVIC’s initial view, the Agency provided a description of
two types of documents that it considered fall
within the scope of the
Applicant’s request. I will not describe these here as to do so may
disclose information the Agency
considers exempt. However, I have carefully
considered the description of those documents and am not satisfied they would be
in full, based on the description alone. That is, I consider a careful
examination of those documents would be required to determine
whether they are
exempt from release under section 30(1). This would include whether there are
public interest arguments that weigh
in favour of disclosure.
also note that these documents would not be the only ones falling within the
terms of the request.
also acknowledge the documents may contain exempt information. However, section
25A(5) requires that I must be satisfied that all
documents falling within the
terms of the request would be exempt.
the reasons described above, as well as the fact that the request covers a broad
range of documents, some of which are likely
to contain factual information not
exempt by way of section 30(3), I am not satisfied it is objectively apparent on
the face of the
request that
documents falling within the terms of
the request would be exempt in their entirety, without having assessed each
document on its
Third element –
there scope to provide an edited copy of the documents requested?
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
Determining
what is ‘practicable’ requires consideration of the effort and
editing involved in making the deletions ‘from
a resources point of
and the effectiveness
of the deletions. Where deletions would render a document meaningless, they are
not ‘practicable’
and release of the document is not required under
section 25.
their FOI request, the Applicant consented to the provision of redacted
documents. Further, in their application for review, the
Applicant stated they
are ‘open to receipt of documents with redacted sections (to maintain any
confidential amounts), to assist
with providing a broader understanding of
Council’s consideration and engagement for the matter’.
Accordingly,
I am satisfied there is scope to provide edited copies of any documents falling
within the terms of the request.
summary, I am not satisfied it is objectively apparent from the nature of the
documents, as described in the Applicant’s
request, that all requested
documents, if they exist, would be exempt in their entirety from release.
Further, I am satisfied there
is scope to provide an edited copy of the
effect of my decision is that the Agency is required to make a new decision on
the request without relying on section 25A(5).
Time to seek a
review of my decision
the Agency is not satisfied with my decision, they are entitled to apply to the
VCAT for it to be reviewed.
