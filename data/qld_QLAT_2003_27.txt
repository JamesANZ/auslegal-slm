DECISION APPEALED AGAINST
Granting of a Licence for a Detached Bottle Shop
Mr J. Rolls (Chairperson)
Dr M. O’Donnell
DECISION DATE
2 June 2003
On the 25th of February 2003 the second
respondent, Chief Executive, Department of Tourism Racing and Fair Trading
(incorporating
Liquor Licensing), determined to grant an application made by
T.W. Hedley Pty Ltd, the applicant/first respondent, to operate a detached
bottle shop located at the White Rock Shopping Centre, Progress Road, White
Rock, Cairns. The application which spawned this decision
was made by the first
respondent on the 31st of May 2002. This application was advertised in
accordance with
Liquor Act 1992
(the Act). Within the
prescribed time for objections, 26 objections were received including one
petition containing 52 signatures.
One of the objectors was a Mr J. Dorrington,
the principal of the Trinity Anglican School. By the time the decision of the
Executive was made granting the application, Mr Dorrington was no longer
the principal of the school. In his stead was Rev. Paul
Bland who was notified
of the decision of the Chief Executive on the 10th of March 2003. Rev. Bland
sought to appeal this determination.
The notice of appeal was received by the
Tribunal on the 11th of April 2003.
Determination
There are two issues which require determination. Firstly,
whether or not Rev. Bland is an “objector” under the Act and,
entitled to appeal pursuant to
of the Act. The second issue is whether
that notice of appeal is within time in accordance with
of the Act. It
is convenient to deal with the latter issue first.
An Appeal out of
Pursuant to
of the Act:
“A person who wishes to appeal against a decision of the Chief
start an appeal in accordance with this section”
(emphasis added).
The appeal is to be started by filing a
notice of appeal with the Registrar of the
Section 31(3)
the Act provides:
“The notice of appeal
be filed with the Registrar within 28
days after the day on which the person received written notice of the Chief
Executive’s
Calculating the 28 day
period in accordance with
Acts Interpretation Act
that, accepting that the decision was received on the 10th of March
the appeal had to be filed
with the Registrar of the Tribunal by the 7th of April 2003. The appeal was
filed on 11 April 2003 and
is four days out of time.
There exists no
inherent right to appeal. A right of appeal is created by statute rather than
the common law.
In order to
establish this tribunal’s jurisdiction, that jurisdiction must be found
from within the terms of the legislation
creating the right to appeal. It
appears to us that the use of the word “must” in ss.31(1) and (3) of
the Act indicates
that it is imperative that these provisions be strictly
complied with in order to found jurisdiction. There is nothing in these
provisions from which it could be suggested that the otherwise clear time limit
imposed by the Act could be set aside varied or extended.
It is perhaps
unfortunate that the legislation does not provide any flexibility, however, that
is not a matter for this tribunal
but for Parliament. In our view the
legislation is clear that the appeal must be filed within 28 days of the
notification of the
decision or this tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the
The view we have taken is consistent with a previous authority
of the Tribunal, see
Sabile v. The Chief
Unfortunately, there is authority to the contrary. In
Schwantes v. The
Chief Executive (Club
it was held that an
appeal which was lodged only one day out of time could be heard by the Tribunal,
extending the time allowed in
which to lodge the appeal. In doing so, the
Tribunal had regard to the provisions of
(1)(e) of the Act.
Section 25(b)
of the Act empowers the Tribunal:
In the exercise of its jurisdiction
the Tribunal:
(a) ...; or
(b) must proceed expeditiously with as little formality and technicality as
consistent with a fair and proper consideration of the
matter before it;
(emphasis added).
Section 26(1)(e)
of the Act enables the Tribunal:
“In a proceeding the Tribunal may:
(e) disregard any defect, error, omission or insufficiency in:
(i) a document; or
(ii) giving advertising or displaying a document.”
In order for the Tribunal to exercise its powers under
of the Act there must, as a prerequisite, be in existence a valid proceeding
necessary to found jurisdiction.
of the Act cannot be used by the
Tribunal to create jurisdiction that it does not otherwise have. The
requirement to proceed expeditiously
and with as little formality and
technicality as possible does not mean that the otherwise plain requirements of
the Act are to be
disregarded. This provision enables the Tribunal to ensure
that the merits of any particular matter are adequately and properly
investigated. It does not mean that it gives the Tribunal jurisdiction at large
to deal with issues that are not otherwise validly
before it. In those
circumstances, we do not consider that
of the Act enables the Tribunal
to extend the power within which an appeal must be lodged.
Further, it
is clear to us that
of the Act does not have the effect of enabling
the time to appeal to be extended. An appeal lodged out of time is not a
error, omission or insufficiency in a document. Nor is the question of
advertising contemplated by
s.26(1)(e)(ii)
of the Act relevant in such a case.
It is difficult to see how this provision is capable of any application at all
in the present
case. In conclusion, we are of the view that the decision of
Schwantes v. The Chief Executive
is wrong and ought not be
Accordingly, we are of the view that this appeal which has been
lodged out of time is not a matter which is capable of being heard
determined by the Tribunal. This Tribunal simply has no jurisdiction to hear
this matter as this appeal has not been commenced
in accordance with the Act.
That being so, we have no alternative but to strike out the appeal.
Valid Objector
Although it is not necessary for us to determine this
issue we would regard Rev. Bland as a valid objector. Rev. Bland is the
of the Trinity Anglican School. That school saw fit to object under
s.119 of the Act. It is clear from the terms of s.119 that
the impact of
licensed premises in a locality on, in particular, schools is a matter of
interest to a decision maker deciding whether
to grant a license. In
circumstances where those that represent the school have, between the date of
the decision and the date of
the appeal, changed we do not consider that the
person who has replaced the original representative of the school is precluded
lodging an appeal founded upon the original objection. Thus, if the appeal
was otherwise in time, Rev. Bland would have been entitled,
in our view, to
prosecute this
In accordance
of the Act the Tribunal orders that Appeal No. 27 of 2002/2003 be
struck out.
