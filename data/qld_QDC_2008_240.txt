[2] The applicant, JG was the complainant in respect of each of the six counts.
The respondent was sentenced to five years imprisonment
in respect of count 1,
two years imprisonment (concurrent) in respect of count 2, and two and a half
years imprisonment (concurrent
in each case) in respect of each of counts 3 to
6. The respondent was ordered to be eligible for parole after serving two
On 28 April 2000, the applicant’s appeal against the conviction
was dismissed and his application for leave to appeal against
the sentence was
[3] The Court of Appeal
outlined the facts in respect of each of counts 2 to 6 (the individual
particularised counts) as
“Count 2 was described by
the complainant as happening when she was six years old when she was living with
her grandmother and
the appellant at a place near the railway at R. It was a
Friday night and her grandmother was at bingo. She was in the lounge room
her step-grandfather asked her if she wanted to play a little game. He told her
to go and lie on her bed and pull down her pants.
He came into her bedroom and
started playing with her vagina with his finger, tickling it and licking it.
Afterwards he said “don’t
tell anybody, it’s our little
secret”. This was the first time that anything of this nature had
Count 3 occurred when the appellant took the complainant in his
blue station wagon to the shops. He stopped his car a couple of blocks
where they lived near some old deserted shops which were around the corner from
a “karaoke thing”. The appellant
then made the complainant play with
his penis using her hand and then suck his penis. This went on for about three
or five minutes
until he “peed in [her] mouth”. She got out of the
car and spat out the urine. She got back into the car and they drove
to the shop
to get milk before going home. This was the only occasion on which he urinated
in her mouth.
Count 4 took place after they moved to a community near R when
the complainant was about nine years old. On this occasion after tickling
licking the complainant’s vagina he for the first time inserted his finger
into her vagina. She said that it hurt and the
appellant said to her “you
like it, don’t you?” No one was at home when this occurred and after
the incident the
appellant said, “it’s our little secret”.
Count 5 related to an incident at the same place which began when the
complainant was playing on the front lawn with her dog Dinah.
It was daylight,
going on dark, and there was no one else at home. The appellant asked the
complainant to come into the shower with
him where he got her to play with his
penis, sucking it and playing with it using her hand. After this incident they
got dressed
and walked to the fish and chips shop. While walking there the
appellant made the complainant hold his hand.
Count 6 was described as the
last time anything happened. The complainant had a new room which was built onto
the house. It was daylight
and the appellant closed the blinds. She lay on her
bed and the appellant played with her vagina. He then took out his erect penis
and rubbed it over her vagina and said “Oh I’d better not put it in;
you might get pregnant”. After the incident,
the appellant told her to go
and play and that it was “our little secret”.”
unlawful sexual relationship was maintained by the respondent with the
complainant from the time the applicant turned six
in August 1990 through until
she left the respondent’s home to reside with her natural mother in D
around Christmas 1994 (by
which stage the applicant was approximately 10 years
[5] The applicant has
suffered mental and nervous shock as a result of the offences committed by the
respondent.
[6] These applications proceed under the now repealed
provisions of Ch 65A (ss 663A, 663AA, 663B and 663BA of the Criminal
[7] Prior to 1 July 1984, Criminal
Code s 663A defined the “prescribed amount” to mean:-
“(a) where the offence in connection with which
the case arises is committed before the commencement of the
Criminal Code
Justices Act Amendment Act
1975, $2,000;
(b) in all other cases, $5,000.”
[8] The “prescribed amount” was increased to $20,000 in respect of
mental or nervous shock by s 663AA which commenced
The “prescribed amount” of
$5,000 applicable before 1 July 1984 “may be awarded as compensation for
each offence
of which the [respondent] was
convicted.”
In R v Jones; ex parte
it was held that the assessment of
damages under (repealed) Criminal Code s 663B is on common law principles of
assessment of damages
for personal injury, provided that the amount does not
exceed the prescribed amount. Costs can be awarded. Criminal Code s 663B(1)
relevantly provides:-
“(1) where a person is convicted on indictment of any indictable
offence relating to the person of any person or of more than
one indictable
offence relating to the person of any person (whether in respect of one
indictment or more than one indictment) arising
out of the one course of conduct
or closely related courses of conduct of that person so convicted, the Court, on
the application
by or on behalf of the person aggrieved by the offence or
offences may, in addition to any other sentence or order it may make, order
to pay to the person aggrieved a sum not exceeding the prescribed amount by way
of compensation for injuries suffered by him
by reason of the offence or
offences of which the offender is convicted.
For the purpose of determining whether such courses of conduct are closely
related, regard shall be had, in addition to any other
relevant matter, to the
acts or omissions constituting the courses of conduct and the times of the doing
of the acts or the making
of the omissions, one in relation to

Compensation
[11] It is submitted
on behalf of the applicant that she has suffered severe mental or nervous shock,
and that each of counts 2 to
6 constituted a separate “course of
conduct” which, considered in the context of the prescribed amount of
$20,000 per
course of conduct, leaves open a maximum award of compensation of
[12] The applicant was examined by Dr Lynette Arnoldus Lewis,
psychologist, on 17 July 2006.
Arnoldus-Lewis expressed the following opinion in respect of the
applicant:-
“In my opinion [JG] suffered severe
‘mental or nervous shock’ as a direct result of these abovementioned
[a reference to the indicted offences] committed on her when she was a
child under sixteen years (from age 6 to approximately 11
years old) by [the
respondent] whilst in his and her maternal grandmother’s care at their
places of residence.
The symptom range she described or demonstrated on presentation met the
stringent criteria for a diagnosis of severe chronic post
traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD; 309.81) and a diverse range of associated disorders including
depression, substance related disorder,
obsessive compulsive disorder,
generalised anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder and agoraphobia, in
accordance with the
Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSMIV-TR). These associated disorders combined with her complex chronic PTSD
was so severe and recalcitrant that they continued to negatively impact on every
aspect of her daily adult life. The psychiatric
disorders have significantly
impaired her development of functional social, familial or adult relationships
as well as, her inability
to achieve a rewarding occupation. According to
literature, children who were exposed to similar types of prolonged abuse,
or trauma that Ms JG was subjected to, over many years, were more likely
to be at high risk of lifelong psychological disorders or
dysfunction perceiving
their experiences as life threatening.
Ms JG’s psychiatric disorders
were severe and chronic, due to compounding effects of repetitive exposure to
traumatic sexual
offences by Mr Clark, her step grandfather, over a long period
of time (approximately six years) during an extremely vulnerable developmental
stage in her life cycle (six to eleven years old) whilst living with him and her
maternal grandmother...it is well documented the
most critical phase for
lifelong psychological injuries in a female’s life cycle is between eleven
to thirteen years old.
The chronicity and severity of her PTSD was also
exacerbated by the inescapability or proximity to the offender over many years.
The onset of Ms JG’s psychiatric disorders was delayed and their full
development emerged, over the next few years and, as
mentioned above, remains
severe and chronic on presentation, at my clinic, possibly partly due to none or
inadequate diagnosis or
treatment, during the acute stage of her
Dr Arnoldus-Lewis goes on to conclude:
“In summary, [JG] sustained severe chronic
PTSD and a diverse range of chronic associated disorders, as a result of being
to repetitive incidents of childhood sexual, physical and emotional
abuse by her primary abuser [the respondent] from six to eleven
years old, with
one additional traumatic sexual incident when she visited his place of
residence, at age thirteen. She also sustained
psychological injuries from
prior, concurrent and post emotional and physical abuse from several other
significant people, including
her mother, stepfather, grandmother and foster
mother, during her childhood. In adulthood, Ms JG predictably embarked upon
emotionally and physically abusive relationships, as a result of these
early childhood abusive relationships and her related psychiatric
However, the chronic psychological injuries arising from the chronic sexual,
emotional and physical abusive acts perpetrated
by [the respondent], during the
most vulnerable period in a female’s life, were without doubt, the most
damaging injuries she
sustained. It is difficult, if not impossible, to
proportion a discrete empirical value or percentage to the psychological
she sustained from specific events committed by [the respondent], but
collectively they impacted or compounded her initial traumatic
injury, resulting
in lifelong severe and chronic PTSD and associated disorders. This initial
unlawful sexual abuse was the most
damaging psychologically because it was
immediately after her mother’s perceived “abandonment”.
However, this
“abandonment” would not have been a traumatic incident
or stressor if it was not reinforced by the initial and subsequent
abusive episodes, or she was placed in the care of loving and protective
grandparents (which is not uncommon) irrespective
of the timeframe.
In my considered opinion, Ms JG requires lifelong therapy to help ameliorate
her recalcitrant psychological injuries and assist her
to cope with future life
crises or possible trauma. The rehabilitation program would involve intensive
weekly therapy for eighteen
months to two years, followed by fortnightly
sessions for approximately six to twelve months, then monthly consultations for
months, at which time she would more than likely require maintenance
therapy to provide a stable base and support. This recommended
rehabilitation
program should be punctuated with regular assessments and modification where
required, with the provision for resumption
of intensive therapy if required at
any stage of the submerging therapy program.
Countless examples of Ms JG’s psychological injuries were available
from the transcript but this would require double the period
I have spent on
this report. Because of the restricted timeframe under the interview (three
hours) and time to analyse the data,
I have only touched the surface. In all my
years of experience, professionally and personally, this case was one of the
most tragic
and psychologically damaging I have encountered. I hope Ms JG finds
people she can trust, and finds a path to healing her horrific
However, her prognosis is not favourable given the severity and recalcitrance
of her untreated psychiatric disorders, and her deeply
entrenched predilection
to reinforce substance abuse, lack of familial or relationship support, lack of
sufficient finances, and
pressures of parenthood.
Again, it is difficult if not impossible to estimate the cost of counselling
or therapy at the current recommended fee in accordance
with my professional
organisation, the Australian Psychological Society Ltd is $186 per
Courses of conduct
[14] It is submitted that there were five separate courses of conduct occurring
at different locations, involving differing particulars,
committed over a period
of four years from August 1992 to December
The courses of conduct were
particularised in the applicant’s written submissions as follows:
First Course of Conduct (Count 2)
The offence occurred in the applicant’s bedroom of the house in R where
she was living with her grandmother and the respondent.
She was aged six years.
The respondent told her to lie on her bed and take her pants down. [The
respondent] came into her bedroom
and started playing with her vagina, tickling
and licking it. This was the first time anything of this nature had happened.
Second Course of Conduct (Count 3)
The offence occurred in the respondent’s vehicle. They were still
living in R. In her statutory declaration dated 15 April
applicant states that she was eight or nine years old. [The respondent] made
the applicant play with his penis using her hand
and then sucked on his penis
until he “peed” in her mouth.
Third Course of Conduct (Count 4)
This offence occurred when the applicant was aged about nine years after they
had moved to M. The respondent made [the applicant]
lie on the bed with him and
then tickled and licked the applicant’s vagina. He then inserted his
finger into her vagina for
the first time.
Fourth Course of Conduct (Count 5)
This offence occurred in the shower at the M house. The respondent asked the
applicant to come into the shower with him where he
got her to play with his
penis, sucking on it and playing with it using her hand.
Fifth Course of Conduct (Count 6)
This offence occurred in a new room that was built onto the M house, after
the applicant had turned ten. The respondent told her
to lie on her bed and he
played with her vagina. [The respondent] then took out his erect penis and
rubbed it against her vagina.
He said words to the effect, “I had better
not put it in, you might get pregnant.”
[15] The applicant’s submissions also make the point that the Court of
Appeal at paragraph 11
“Such incidents were discrete and specific. The events (were)
identified with sufficient particularity. There was no possibility
ambiguity.”
[16] Although, the court was there talking about the issue of particularity in
terms of a submission before the court relevant to
the conviction appeal, the
submissions made by the applicant in these proceedings are that the
particularity identified there by
the Court of Appeal is relevant to the
“courses of conduct” requirements of the criminal compensation
legislation, that
is “that the identified courses of conduct fall into the
HW v LO category, namely that each charge was constituted by distinct
separate acts on occasions clearly separated in time, place and
circumstance.”
[17] In my view,
the submission made on behalf of the applicant is compelling. I find that there
were five courses of conduct, and
as a consequence the relevant maximum
compensation available to the applicant in these circumstances is $100,000
($20,000 per course
of conduct).
[18] The issue of causation
arises from the report of Dr Arnoldus-Lewis, who identified:
“Psychological
injuries from prior, concurrent and post emotional and physical abuse from
several other significant people including
her mother, stepfather, grandmother
and foster mother, during her
childhood.”
[19] However, the issue of causation, in terms of other contributing factors to
the injury, and in a situation where there is a history
of sexual abuse
extending beyond the matters the subject of the charges before the court, has
been addressed by the Court of Appeal,
which stated in SAM v
“The primary judge [adopted] a common sense approach to causation and
concluded that the commission of two serious offences
of sexual abuse by a
natural father upon his daughter was a material contribution to her present
psychological injuries. This approach,
with respect, appears to be plainly
[20] Clearly, a “material contribution” to the applicant’s
injury, as a matter of common sense, where the effects
are unable to be
separated, entitle the applicant to compensation in respect of the whole
In light of Dr
Arnoldus-Lewis’s opinion that “the chronic psychological injuries
arising from the chronic sexual, emotional
and physical abusive acts perpetrated
by [the respondent], during the most vulnerable period in a female’s life,
were without
doubt, the most damaging injuries she
” it is a situation where I
am persuaded that the applicant is entitled to receive compensation assessed in
respect of the whole
of her injuries.
[21] The applicant submits that an
assessment on a common law basis would involve an assessment of $50,000 for pain
and suffering
and loss of amenities, $26,412 for 140 therapy sessions at $186
per hour, based on Dr Arnoldus-Lewis’s opinion for a requirement
lifelong therapy,
and economic loss of
$30,000 (the applicant having never had a permanent job or being able to
maintain long-term employment). In
my view, these sums are a conservative
submission in respect of the injuries suffered by the applicant, which clearly
the worse category of such injuries. The sum submitted for exceeds
the maximum which can be awarded based on five courses of conduct,
accordingly I award compensation in the amount of

in any way to her own

clearly entitled to her costs (for whatever value that may be in a practical

the respondent Maurice Ernest Fitzroy Clark pay the applicant, JG the sum of
$100,000 for criminal compensation
