Mr G C Lalor, Deputy President
On 18 October 2006 the
ACT Medical Board (�the Board�) filed an application (�the Board�s
application�) with the Australian Capital
Territory Health Professions Tribunal
(�the Tribunal�) which was established under
Professionals Act 2004
application the Board sought:
declaration under
section 64(1)(l)
that Raymond George Newcombe � is a person
who, if he were registered as a medical practitioner under the Act, would have
found by the Tribunal to have contravened the required standard of
practice for persons registered as medical practitioners and/or
satisfy the suitability to practise requirements for medical practitioners�.
A summary of the
allegations in support of the application is set out in the filed
In short they relate to
allegations of �
unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional
misconduct in respect of his treatment�
of four patients, Richard Ord,
Helen Langham, Tracey de Jong and Gordon Silk.
Particulars of the allegations are contained in the filed document.
By Application dated
18 September and filed with the Tribunal Dr Newcombe (�the Doctor�) caused an
application (�the Doctor�s Application�)
for orders to be filed in which he
sought orders that:
The application dated 18
October 2006 be struck out pursuant to
Section 58(2)(d)
Health Professionals
on the grounds that the application is frivolous and/or vexatious.
the alternative to 1, that the proceedings be permanently stayed as an abuse of
A filed affidavit of
Emma Therese Lawrence set out the grounds relied on in support of this
application.
The Board filed a
response to the application on 24 January 2007 in which �
it contends, inter
alia, that the evidentiary material filed in support of the application is
incapable of providing a legal basis
for any of the orders sought�.
The Board further stated in that
Response that should the application proceed certain witnesses were required
for cross-examination.
On the hearing
of the application the Board abandoned this request.
On 15 February 2007
the Board filed an amended response in which it contended, inter alia, in its
opposition to the
�application in its entirety�
the Tribunal does not
have jurisdiction to stay the proceedings; and
that the evidentiary
material filed in support of the application is incapable of providing a legal
basis for any of the orders
The Doctor�s
application came on for hearing on Wednesday 21 March 2007.
Prior to the hearing directions had been
given that the parties were to file documentary evidence on which each sought
the hearing of the Doctor�s application.
These directions were complied with.
The Board�s
application was brought under
Health Professionals Act 2004
which came into operation on 7 July 2005.
On that date the
Medical Practitioners Act 1930
was repealed.
The subsequent Act provides that a
regulation �
must establish a health profession board in relation to the
profession�.
The functions of a
Board so established are set out in
of the Act which provides in so
far as is applicable:
Also, the health
profession board for a health profession exercises the functions given to it
under this Act in relation to the
health profession, including the following:
administering
a scheme of registration for, and of continuous review of the standard practice
of, health professionals in the profession;
fees for administration by the board;
advice to the Minister, profession and public about matters relevant to the
profession;
standards of practice for the profession;
part in any entity responsible for the development of policies for the
promotion and maintenance of standards of practice
within the profession or
within regulated health professions generally;
educational and training courses related to professional qualifications;
and monitoring continuing competence of registered professionals in the
profession and their professional development;
with registered professionals who contravene the required standard of practice
or who do not satisfy the suitability to
practise requirements;
information to allow the laying of charges against people who commit offences
against this Act;
in the development of the required standard of practice;
the required standard of practice;
and promoting best practice standards to which registered health professionals
should aspire;
supportive relationships with individuals or entities that have a shared
interest in public protection and health professional
regulation;
information to confirm whether or not someone is a registered health
professional.
If a health profession
board wants a health professional�s registration suspended or cancelled, the
board cannot suspend or cancel
the registration itself, but may apply to the
health professions tribunal for suspension or cancellation.�
The ACT Medical Board
was established under
Subsection 4(1)
Health Professionals Regulation
It is mentioned in Schedule 1
column 2 and is established to regulate medical practitioners, being the health
profession mentioned
in column 3 of that Schedule.
Factual background to the application
The Community and
Health Services Complaints Commissioner for the Australian Capital Territory
received a request from the Medical
Board of the Australian Capital Territory
to investigate a concern raised relating to medical services provided to Mrs
On 14 March 2001 the
Commissioner wrote to the Doctor and advised him that he had decided to
investigate the matter �
Section 40(1)(d)
Community and Health
Services Complaints Act 1993
The Commissioner
advised the Canberra Relations Officer for the Canberra Hospital, Ms J.
McLaren, of this investigation on 13 March
The Commissioner

report he found that:
peer reviewer expressed some concerns about Dr Newcombe�s failure to make
adequate attempts to clarify the diagnosis by
obtaining an MRI scan prior to
performing the surgical procedure, the explanations provided by Dr Newcombe, Dr
Abraszko and Dr
Galloway seem to be reasonable in the circumstances.
Ms Langham did have raised intercranial
pressure and needed an immediate operation�.
The Commissioner found
that it would have been preferable for an MRI scan to have been performed prior
to the operation on Mrs Langham
but that in the circumstances it was reasonable
to perform the operation without it.
recommended that the Medical Board and Dr Newcombe note the findings of the
As part of the material
tendered to me, there was a report dated February 2003 of the investigation
into adverse patient outcomes
of neurosurgical services provided by the
Canberra Hospital.
This report was the
result of a Committee being appointed by the Minister of Health, Housing and
Community Care for the Australian
Capital Territory in May 1999 to conduct a
clinical audit of neurosurgery procedures in relation to clinical processes and
privileges.
At page 16 of that
report the Doctor�s clinical competence was reported on as follows:
reviewer found that Dr Newcombe exhibited difficulty in relation to certain
procedures.
He also found that there
appeared to be issues of judgement exhibited by Dr Newcombe.
He found that there was some basis for the
complaints by Dr McLaren concerning Dr Newcombe.
However, the peer reviewer did not believe that, given Dr
Newcombe had already imposed restrictions on his practice, any further
restrictions on Dr Newcombe�s practice were necessary.
As the peer
reviewer only considered 14 patients under the care of Dr Newcombe, from the
period 1994 to 2002, we still do not know
definitely the level of Dr Newcombe�s
clinical competent (sic) as a neurosurgeon.
�����������������������
The peer reviewer�s view
was sufficient to support Dr Newcombe�s own decision to cease surgical
procedures in the ACT.
2002, Dr Newcombe responded appropriately to concerns about his standards of
practice and chose to cease surgical procedures
in the ACT.
reviewer has not suggested further limitations or restrictions on Dr Newcombe�s
The responsibility for any
further action is with the Medical Board of the ACT.�
Mrs Langham�s case was one of those considered during this
investigation as �Patient O�.
Medical Board of the Australian Capital Territory on 5 March 2003 advised that
it had resolved not to conduct an inquiry into
the actions of any registered
medical practitioner named in the report.
On 23 March 2004 the
Medical Board of the Australian Capital Territory held an extraordinary meeting
and resolved to conduct an
Inquiry into the practice of Dr Newcombe, based
upon concerns about the standard of treatment, poor decision-making and
insufficient
and poor advice regarding treatment options. The inquiry will
determine whether Dr Newcombe has been guilty of professional misconduct
if so found, to determine what further action in relation to his continuing practice
might be appropriate.�
In coming to its
decision to conduct an Inquiry, the Medical Board considered the February 2003
report together with further representations
from Mrs Langham and Dr McLaren,
Senior Consultant Physician in Rehabilitation Medicine, of 15 October 2003
together with a statement
from Ms Tracey de Jong dated 10 March 2004 and
another from Ms Yvette Stockheim dated 11 March 2004.
It also considered material presented by the Doctor.
�����������
Following a
further report by Dr McLaren dated 9 September 2004, the matter relating to Mr
Gordon Silk was notified as being part
of the Inquiry.
On 8 April 2004 the Medical Board suspended the Doctor�s
registration
section 42(2)
Medical Practitioners Act
pending the outcome of its
inquiry and on 18 May 2004 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal temporarily
stayed that suspension following
undertakings given by the Doctor.
On 30 September 2004 the Doctor advised that
he was not seeking to renew his registration in the Australian Capital
Territory and
that he wanted his name to be removed from the ACT register.
The Law relating to the
continuation of the Inquiry.
On 7 July 2005 the
Health Professionals Act 2004
commenced and the
Medical Practitioners Act 1930
was repealed.
Section 140 of the 2004
Act makes provision for unfinished board inquiries under the repealed Act,
which is apposite to this inquiry.
Section provides:

a board had begun an inquiry in relation to person

the inquiry had not finished.

Counsel for the
Doctor has submitted that the Board�s Application should be dismissed as it has
no legal basis for continuing with
It was submitted that
Legislation Act 2001
has general

This section does not

This section is a
determinative provision.
In this section:
includes liability to penalty for an offence against the law.
includes punishment and forfeiture.
e includes immunity.

of the same
Act provides that a determinative provision �
may be displaced expressly or
by a contrary intention�.
It was submitted that a
contrary intention cannot be shown within Section 140 of the Health
Professional Act and thus the order
sought by the Board should have been sought
Medical Practitioners Act 1930
and not the
Health Professionals Act
I cannot accede to this submission.
I am of the view that
Section 140
clearly provides a contrary
intention to the continuation of the provisions of the 1930 Act.
That section provides that any unfinished
inquiry by a Board must be treated as a report to it under that Act.
Part 9 of the Act is concerned with Reports
to the Board and Part 10 provides that the relevant Board must consult with the
and Health Services Complaints Commission concerning the action to be
taken in relation to the report.
Act provides in Section 86(3)(b)(ii) for a declaration under Section 64(1)(l)
of the Act where the health professional the subject
of the report is not
registered.
Section 140 would have
no practical meaning if it were otherwise.
I am of the view that the Legislature has clearly expressed an intention
that any unfinished Board inquiry should be treated as a
report under the
provisions of the 2004 Act and that such reports should be dealt with according
to that Act.
Application to stay as an abuse of process
The Doctor has sought
an order that �
the proceedings be permanently stayed as an abuse of
This order is resisted by
the Board on the basis that �
the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to stay
the proceeding.�
The Act does not
provide a specific power in the Tribunal to stay proceedings brought before
In the absence of a specific power,
is there an implied power to do so?
The Act does not
contain any direct authority for the Tribunal to so act.
Section 55 allows for the Tribunal to �
on its own procedures�
if none is provided for anything �
required or
allowed to be done�
by the Tribunal under the Act or under another
Territory law.
A stay is not one such �
required or allowed to be done by the Tribunal by legislation of the Australian
Capital Territory.
The legislative power
for the Tribunal to make orders is contained in Section 64 of the Act as set
Subsection (1) allows the
Tribunal to �
do 1 or more of the following in relation to a person to whom
an application applies ��
orders consequential upon a finding by the Tribunal are set out.
Subsection (2) then provides:
health professions tribunal may make any other order it considers appropriate.�
This power is very wide
but in my view does not extend to giving a legislative basis for the granting
By the use of the word �
it is my view that this empowers the tribunal to make further orders as the
justice of the situation requires in making the consequential
orders following
a finding on the merits of a matter before it if there is no specific order set
out in subsection (1) of Section
Does the tribunal have
an inherent power to prevent an abuse of its processes?
The High Court in
Grassby �v- The
[1989] HCA 45
(1989) 168 CLR 1
has said that an inferior court has no such
power as that power derives �
from the general responsibility of a superior
court of unlimited jurisdiction for the administration of justice�.
Dawson J in that matter said at p 16:
notwithstanding that its powers may be defined, every court undoubtedly
possesses jurisdiction arising by implication upon
the principle that the grant
of power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise �
Those implied powers may in many instances
serve a function similar to that served by the inherent powers exercised by a
court but they are derived from a different source and are limited in
their extent.
The difference between inherent
as Menzies J points
out, fundamental.�
His Honour continued at p 17:
be unprofitable to attempt to generalize in speaking of the powers which an
inferior court must possess by way of necessary
implication.
Recognition of the existence of such powers
will be called for whenever they are required for the effective exercise of a

be �derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring
There is in my view no
reason why, where appropriate, they may not extend to the ordering a stay of
proceedings.�
The Full Court of the
Supreme Court of South Australia held in
James �v- Medical Board of South
Australia and Keogh
BC200606717 of 30 August 2006
per Anderson J with
Bleby J and Gray J agreeing:
Disciplinary
tribunals such as the Board and the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal
are vested with implied powers to control
all aspects of procedure which relate
to procedural fairness.
That of course
is subject to the overriding supervisory power of the Supreme Court.
It is my view that an allegation of an abuse
of process comes within the implied powers of the Board.�
In that case Anderson J
after discussing
Walton �v- Gardiner
(1992) 177 CLR 378
that part of his judgment by saying:
Court is effectively saying that the Medical Tribunal has the power to stay its
own proceedings in the event of an abuse
of process.
� It seems to me therefore that the reasoning of the courts and
indeed of the Board in the Manock matter, leads to the conclusion
Board does have, as part of its jurisdiction, an implied power to deal with an
abuse of process argument.�
The Full Court of the
Supreme Court of South Australia considered the question of whether the Medical
Board had an implied power
to stay proceedings before it as an abuse of process
The Medical Board of South Australia �v-JRPN

decision handed down on 31 January 2006.
This decision was not referred to in the Jones matter.
Debelle J was dissenting in this matter and
said at paragraph 32:
is ordered, the Tribunal will not inquire into a complaint.
In that way, the power to order a stay has
the capacity to affect the question whether the medical practitioner is guilty
matters charged in the complaint and whether the practitioner is guilty
of unprofessional conduct.
The power to
order a stay on the ground of abuse of process is, therefore, a power which is
necessary for the proper exercise of
the jurisdiction to hear and determine the
complaint in the sense explained in
Attorney-General v Walker
reasonably required or legally ancillary to that jurisdiction.
For these reasons, the grant of the power to
enquire into the subject matter of the complaint necessarily implies that the
has power to stay proceedings on the ground of abuse of process.
A decision to grant or refuse a stay will be
subject to an appeal to this Court pursuant to s66 of the Act in the same way

Besanko J with whom Layton J agreed said at
paragraph 71:
end, the question in this case is whether, as a matter of the statutory
construction of the
Medical Practitioners Act 1983
, the power to order a stay
of proceedings on the ground of the abuse of process is legally ancillary to
some other power which
the Tribunal possesses, or is reasonably required for
the purposes of some other such power or powers.�
At paragraph 76 His Honour continued:
is under no obligation to inquire into the subject matter of a complaint if it
considers that the complaint is frivolous
or vexatious.
Although not expressly stated in the Act, I
assume that the Board would make an order dismissing such a complaint.
The power to dismiss a complaint on the
ground that it is frivolous or vexatious and the power to stay proceedings on
that they constitute an abuse of process overlap, but are not
Nevertheless, the fact that
the Board is given the power to dismiss a complaint on the ground that it is
frivolous or vexatious,
and the Tribunal is not, is suggestive of a legislative
intent that the Tribunal cannot decline to inquire into the subject matter
It seems to me that this
follows first, simply because the power is given to the Board but not to the
Tribunal and secondly, because
it highlights the two-tiered nature of the
disciplinary procedure, with frivolous and vexatious complaints �filtered out�

The two-tiered nature of the
disciplinary procedure does not mean that there might never be a case to reach
that Tribunal which,
for one reason or another, should not proceed, but it is
suggestive of the fact that the legislature has addressed the question
express terms devised a particular structure to deal with it.�
At paragraphs 79 and 80 His Honour found:
�It might also be said with considerable force that this
Court should have no difficulty in inferring that the Tribunal has the power

do not think it is permissible to imply a power to stay proceedings on such a
broad basis and it is necessary to return
to the test formulated by the
majority in
Pelechowski
not think it can be said that the power to stay proceedings on the ground of
abuse of process is legally ancillary to a power
given to the Tribunal by the
provisions of the
Medical Practitioners Act 1983
Nor do I think it can be said that the power is reasonably
required for the exercise of an express power in the Act.
Ultimately, the question is whether a power
can be implied as a matter of statutory construction and authorities such as
v Forbes; Ex parte Bevan
Grassby v R
Pelechowski
DJL v Central Authority
(above) suggest that even though the
touchstone of necessity is reasonableness, and not whether the power is
essential, there must
be a firm basis in the relevant legislation for implying
the asserted power.
There is no such
basis here and in fact, as I have already said, the express legislative
provisions point against the existence
of such a power.�

Australia in a judgment delivered in Canberra on 27 June 1994 in

Judgment (Gallop J dissenting) Neaves and Ryan JJ in discussing
�v- McGregor
(1986) 6 NSWLR 246
said at paragraph 5:
discussing the inherent jurisdiction of a superior court in respect of criminal
proceedings, his Honour continued at 251:
In the absence of a contrary
decision of the High Court on the point I think that this court as a superior
court of justice, has
inherent power to prevent an abuse of procedure in
instituting or continuing proceedings in both civil and criminal cases.
It is not necessary in the present case to
determine whether the disciplinary tribunal itself had jurisdiction to stay the
proceedings
strongly of opinion that not only has this Court the inherent power to stay its
own civil and criminal proceedings for
abuse of process but its general supervisory
and protective power extends to protecting inferior courts and tribunals from
of their procedure in relation to civil, criminal and disciplinary
The Board submitted
that there is authority to support the proposition that where a Tribunal has
commenced to hear an application,
it has no power to determine that it ought
That may be so but it is not
the case here.
The Tribunal has not
commenced to hear the matter.
The law in the area is
not clear and it was for that reason I asked the parties if they wished me to
refer a question of law to

Territory pursuant to
of the Act.
Neither party wished to make an application to do so and so I continued
with the hearing.
Professionals Act 2004
in Division 7.3 sets out the procedure for proceedings

application is made under Section 46A for a declaration under
Section 64(1)
the procedure set out in that Division is applicable.
Although Section 49A is expressed to apply to �
an application
to suspend or cancel a health professional�s registration�
and there being
no similar legislation applicable to an application for an order such as is
sought in this matter, I am of the view
that the procedure set out in this section
must be followed.
In the authorities
cited above it seems that to infer implied powers to an inferior court or
tribunal it is only possible to do
so if there is
�a firm basis in the
relevant legislation for implying the asserted power�.
I am of the view that this is not the
case in relation to proceedings before the Tribunal.
It would appear from
the reading of the South Australian cases that there is a two-tiered structure
in that State.
Where a complaint is
made it is laid before a Board which considers whether the complaint is
frivolous or vexatious or lays it before
the Tribunal.
The Board has the power to reprimand.
Once a matter is before a Tribunal the Act
is clear in that it the Tribunal
shall inquire into the subject matter of
the complaint
It is for this
reason that the majority found in

of process.
the course of that judgment it was accepted that Superior Courts had the power
to stay proceedings as an abuse of process if
their continuance would be
unjustifiably �vexatious and oppressive�.
This power is undoubtedly inherent in a Superior Court.
The Tribunal, in my
view, by having the power expressly given it in the legislation to conduct a
preliminary hearing under Section
58 of the Act and to
�strike out the
application because it is frivolous or vexatious�
has had that firm
legislative base for inferring a power in it to stay a proceeding for an abuse
of its processes removed.
The power is
not to stay but to strike out as being frivolous or vexatious.
In my view the Medical
Board of the Australian Capital Territory has no power to stay proceedings for
an abuse of its processes.
The Doctor�s further
submission is that the Board�s application be struck out under Section 58 of
the Act as being frivolous or
Counsel for the Doctor conceded that his application was ostensibly that
the application was vexatious given the age of the doctor,
his medical
condition, his state of memory and the lapse of time from the date of the
medical treatment from which the complaints
These matters coupled with the fact that the Doctor was no longer
on the register in the Australian Capital Territory made the continuation
this complaint vexatious, i.e. such as to make it not possible for the Doctor
to get a fair hearing of the complaints against
Counsel specifically resiled from any suggestion that the
proceedings had been brought for a collateral or improper purpose.
It was not submitted
that these matters individually were sufficient to establish that the
application was vexatious but that taken
together they were so.

No submission was made that the lapse of

to unfairness on its own.
