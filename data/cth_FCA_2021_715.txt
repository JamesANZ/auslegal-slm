Capic v Ford Motor Company of Australia Pty Ltd [2021] FCA 715 (29 June 2021)
FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA
Capic v Ford Motor Company Of Australia Pty Ltd
In accordance with the practice of the Federal Court in cases of public
interest, importance or complexity, the following summary
has been prepared to
accompany the Orders made today. This summary is intended to assist in
understanding the outcome of this proceeding
and is not a complete statement of
the conclusions reached by the Court. The only authoritative statement of the
Court’s reasons
is that contained in the published reasons for judgment
which will be available on the internet at
www.fedcourt.gov.au
together with this
The Applicant Biljana Capic brought this proceeding as a representative
proceeding under Part IV of the
Federal Court of Australia Act 1976
(Cth) on behalf of herself and the group whom she represents, against Ford
Motor Company of Australia Pty Ltd (‘Ford Australia’).
The initial
trial of the matter occurred over six weeks between 15 June 2020 and
24 July 2020. The matters for determination at
the initial trial were
(a) the whole of Ms Capic’s individual claim and (b) a series of
questions of fact and law said to be
common to the claims of the group members.
These questions are recorded in the Schedule to the Orders of Perram J dated
7 July 2020
(‘Common Questions’).
The case relates to various problems alleged to exist with 73,451 vehicles,
manufactured by Ford Motor Company (‘Ford US’)
July 2010 and December 2016 and imported into Australia by Ford Australia,
which contained a type of transmission called
(‘Affected Vehicles’). The Affected Vehicles were manufactured
under three model lines: Focus,
Fiesta and EcoSport. The exact size of the
group is presently undetermined but it comprises the Applicant and anyone who
or otherwise acquired an interest in an Affected Vehicle between
1 January 2011 and 29 November 2018 who did not opt out of the
proceeding.
The Applicant’s case at the initial trial was twofold: first, she
brought a claim under s 271(1) of the Australian Consumer
(‘ACL’) for damages under s 272(1) on the basis that the Affected
Vehicles were not of acceptable quality when supplied
to consumers contrary to
the guarantee in ACL
(‘Acceptable Quality Claim’);
and secondly, she brought a claim for damages under ACL s 236(1) on
the basis that Ford
Australia engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in
connection with the promotion and sale of the Affected Vehicles contrary
(‘MDC Claim’).
The Acceptable Quality Claim comprised allegations that the Affected Vehicles
as supplied suffered from two sets of deficiencies:
(a) A real risk that four components of the transmission
would fail, being the input shaft seals, the clutch lining, the transmission
control module and the rear main oil seal (together, the ‘Component
Deficiencies’); and
(b) So-called ‘architectural’ features which created risks of
failure because they meant that the DPS6 inadequately managed
the torsional
vibrations and heat generated by the engine (the ‘Architectural
Deficiencies’).
It was alleged that the Component Deficiencies and Architectural Deficiencies
meant that the Affected Vehicles had a propensity to
exhibit a range of
undesirable behaviours including shudder, jerking, sudden deceleration and loss
of power, difficulty changing
gears and gear rattling (among others).
The Applicant was largely successful in proving that the Affected Vehicles
supplied with the relevant original components were not
of acceptable quality
within the meaning of ACL
However, the Applicant did not succeed in
proving her case on the rear main oil seal or her case on the
‘half-hybrid’
clutches which contained a combination of two clutch
lining materials. These components were not found to carry a real risk of
and therefore Affected Vehicles were not found to have been supplied
contrary to ACL
by reason of these two components.
The Applicant was partially successful in her case on the Architectural
Deficiencies. She failed to prove that the DPS6 had a risk
of failure owing to
the way in which heat was managed. However, she succeeded in proving that the
DPS6 inadequately managed torsional
vibrations and that this could cause gear
rattling and a slight shudder at low speeds. Despite
Ford Australia’s description
of these symptoms as ‘normal
operating characteristics’ of the DPS6, it was found that all of the
Affected Vehicles as
supplied were not of acceptable quality by reason of the
inadequate management of torsional vibrations.
Ford Australia implemented various fixes for the proven Component
Deficiencies but not for the Architectural Deficiencies. Where
implemented in production, it was for the Applicant to prove that vehicles as
supplied were not of acceptable quality
even despite the revised components.
The Applicant did not succeed in doing this. Where fixes were implemented in
service for vehicles
on the road, it was for Ford Australia to show that these
fixes were effective. It succeeded in doing this for the final versions
revised components with the exception of the replacement of original clutches
with the ‘half-hybrid’ variety referred
Insofar as her individual claim was concerned, Ms Capic was awarded
damages for reduction in value and other reasonably foreseeable
loss and damage
under ACL s 272(1).
The group’s Acceptable Quality Claim is significantly more complicated
and is not finally resolved by these reasons and orders.
The group claimed
damages assessed on an aggregate basis. Such damages were not awarded. The
primary reason for this was the operation
of ACL s 271(6). Put simply,
that provision confers on Ford Australia a defence to a claim for reduction
in value damages where,
pursuant to an express warranty, it fixed a relevant
problem with an Affected Vehicle within a reasonable time. Whether
Ford Australia
did so for each group member was not an issue litigated in
the initial trial. It is an issue the resolution of which will depend
particular position of each group member.
The Applicant and the group members were wholly unsuccessful in their MDC
The consequence of the findings of fact and law made in these reasons for
judgment is that only some of the Common Questions may now
be answered.
Moreover, other questions not yet posed will now need to be if the resolution of
the group’s Acceptable Quality
Claim is to progress. The Orders made
today provide for the parties to return before the Court for a case management
27 July 2021 at 9.30 am where the consequences of the reasons for
judgment and the future conduct of the matter will be discussed.
Lastly and for completeness, it is noted that the Orders also deal with a set
of documents listed in Annexure A to the Orders. At
the conclusion of the
initial trial Ford Australia objected to the Applicant’s attempt to rely
upon 84 identified documents
on the basis that it would be procedurally unfair
for her to do so. The Court has largely sustained Ford Australia’s
and ordered that the Applicant not be entitled to rely on the
documents listed in Annexure A.

SECTION XVII: CONCLUSION AND
ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS
SECTION I: INTRODUCTION
1 The Applicant,
Ms Capic, brings this suit on her own behalf and on behalf of the group
whom she represents, against Ford Motor Company
of Australia Pty Ltd
(‘Ford Australia’). When referring to Ms Capic in her capacity
as the group’s representative
I will refer to her as the Applicant and
when referring to her in her own capacity I will call her Ms Capic. I deal
first with the
position of Ms Capic and then of the group whom she
represents.
24 December 2012 Ms Capic purchased a 2012 Ford Focus from Sterling
Ford in Melbourne which had been imported into Australia
by the Respondent. She
claims that since its purchase her vehicle has displayed a number of mechanical
difficulties which she says
are associated with its transmission (a 6-speed dry
dual clutch PowerShift transmission, known as the ‘DPS6’). These
difficulties are alleged to include shuddering, sudden deceleration, grinding
noises and difficulties with gear selection (but there
are many others). As the
case was run, Ms Capic said that the DPS6 had certain features which
created a risk that the symptoms would
occur and she says that those risks were
all present at the time that she purchased the vehicle. She submits that the
a vehicle which is inherently subject to such risks of failure
contravenes the guarantee of acceptable quality imposed by s 54 of
Australian Consumer Law
(‘ACL’), being Sch 2 to the
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth) (‘the Act’).
3 For reasons I will later explain, there is no doubt that s 54 applies
to the Respondent as the importer of the vehicle. ACL s 271(1)
Ms Capic to sue the Respondent for breach of the guarantee of acceptable
quality and to recover damages from it. Without
expanding at this stage on what
any of the following mechanical engineering jargon means, Ms Capic says
that the DPS6 posed four
risks related to components within it (‘the
Component Deficiencies’). The components and their risks of failure
Input shaft
seals which had a tendency to leak permitting lubricants from the gearbox side
of the transmission to enter the part of
the bell housing containing the
otherwise dry clutch and drive plates and contaminate them;
friction material on the faces of the clutch and drive plates (the friction
material is also referred to as the ‘clutch
A transmission
control module (‘TCM’) which contained a printed circuit board
(‘PCB’) to which was affixed,
amongst other things, two types of
integrated circuits known as an ATIC 91 and an ATIC 106. These were affixed to
the PCB by means
of solder. Ms Capic says that the coefficients of thermal
expansion of the PCB and the ATIC 91 and ATIC 106 chips were different
repeated heating and cooling of the TCM (which is attached to the transmission
assembly) created a risk of the solder cracking;
A rear main oil
seal which had a tendency to leak permitting lubricants to enter the bell
housing from the engine side of the transmission
and contaminate the clutch and
drive plates.
4 Ms Capic submits that each of the first three risks eventuated in the
case of her vehicle and gave rise to a range of symptoms including
shudder. Her
case, however, is not that her vehicle is not of acceptable quality because the
risks materialised, it is rather that
it was not of acceptable quality because
it was supplied with these risks inherent in it. The full implications of
running her case
on the basis of risks were not always appreciated by either
5 I have concluded that she has established the existence of each of the
risks set out above except the risk said to arise from the
rear main oil seal.
For each risk she has a separate cause of action under ACL s 271(1)
entitling her to claim damages from the
Respondent under s 272.
6 As it happens, I am also satisfied that in the case of her vehicle the
three risks which I have accepted also manifested themselves
and that after they
did her vehicle displayed a troubling range of behaviours. Ms Capic took
her vehicle for servicing on many occasions
and complained about these problems.
For a long time they were not fixed. However, in the case of the input shaft
seals they were
eventually replaced in a way which satisfies me that after the
replacement the risk posed by them no longer existed.
7 In the case of the TCM the issue is slightly more complex. There are two
relevant events. The first involved the installation
of a software update known
as 15B22 which detected solder cracking before actual symptoms became
perceptible to the driver. The
second was the replacement of the old TCM with a
new TCM with a revised ATIC 91 chip. It is only after this second event
am satisfied that the relevant risk of TCM failure was removed in
Ms Capic’s vehicle. I am not satisfied that she has demonstrated
existence of the problem with the original ATIC 106 chips.
8 In the case of the friction material I am not satisfied that the Respondent
has satisfactorily resolved the problem.
9 These conclusions matter because the Respondent asserts that it is entitled
to rely upon ACL s 271(6) in response to Ms Capic’s
(6) If an affected person in relation to goods
has, in accordance with an express warranty given or made by the manufacturer of
goods, required the manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply with a
guarantee referred to in subsection (1), (3) or
(a) by repairing the goods; or
(b) by replacing the goods with goods of an identical type;
then, despite that subsection, the affected person is not entitled to commence
an action under that subsection to recover damages
of a kind referred to in
section 272(1)(a) unless the manufacturer has refused or failed to remedy
the failure, or has failed to
remedy the failure within a reasonable
10 The proper construction of this provision is very difficult and I will not
touch upon it here. I will simply say that I accept
that the risk inherent in
the input shaft seals with which her vehicle was supplied was eliminated when
they were replaced and that
the risk posed by the TCM was eliminated when her
vehicle received a new TCM with the revised ATIC 91 chip.
11 However, in both cases I do not accept that the Respondent did this within
a reasonable time so that s 271(6) does not apply.
Consequently, I am
satisfied that Ms Capic is entitled to sue the Respondent for the reduction
in value damage she has suffered as
a result of the supply to her of a vehicle
with the three inherent risks.
12 In addition to her case that the four components above were attended by a
risk of failure Ms Capic also pursued a more general
case that her vehicle
was not of acceptable quality because it had a risk of certain symptoms
(principally, but not only shudder)
because of what were said to be two
architectural features of the DPS6 (‘the Architectural
Deficiencies’). These were:
Inadequate heat
management; and
damping of torsional vibrations.
13 These problems were designated as ‘architectural’ because of a
contention that they could not be cured without changes
to the architecture of
the DPS6 and that this in fact had not occurred. The Respondent denied the
existence of either risk. I have
concluded that the heat management case does
not succeed. However, I have accepted that the manner in which the DPS6 damped
vibrations generated a risk that the gears in her vehicle would rattle
and that the vehicle would display a slight shudder at low
speeds. There was no
dispute that there was a risk that these two symptoms could occur. Indeed, the
Respondent submitted that they
were both ‘normal operating
characteristics’ of the DPS6. I have not accepted that the fact that gear
rattling and a
slight shudder at low speeds are described as normal operating
characteristics has the consequence that they cannot constitute a
breach of the
guarantee of acceptable quality. I have concluded that the fact that
Ms Capic’s vehicle was supplied with these
two problems inherent in
it has the consequence that it is not of acceptable quality for the purposes of
s 271(1) and she has another
cause of action against the Respondent in
respect of them. Since the Respondent claims these features are normal
operating characteristics
it has not attempted to resolve them.
14 Ms Capic claims
that she is entitled to reduction in value damages under s 272(1)(a). I
have accepted that she is and that she
is entitled to the sum of $6,820.91
together with interest up to judgment from 24 December 2012. Ms Capic
also claims to be entitled
to damages under s 272(1)(b) because, so it is
argued, she paid too much GST and stamp duty on the purchase of the vehicle on
basis (as it has fallen out) that it was worth 30% less than the $22,736.36
she paid for it. For myself, there is an interesting
and complex question not
dealt with by the parties whether an award of these damages is conceptually
coherent since Ms Capic is to
be placed in the position she would have been
if the vehicle had complied with the guarantee of acceptable quality. On one
this has been done by awarding her $6,820.91 for reduction in value
damages and there is then no sense in which GST and stamp duty
represent losses,
those being amounts Ms Capic always expected to pay in the bargained-for
position to which she would have been
restored. However, this was not a defence
raised by the Respondent. In any event I have determined that even if it had
issue would not have been a bar to Ms Capic recovering these sums. Of
the actual defences raised by the Respondent to this claim
for damages, I have
not found any persuasive. I therefore award amounts for GST and stamp duty.
15 Ms Capic purchased the vehicle using a finance lease. She also
claims to be entitled to damages for the fact that she was required
‘borrow’ more than she should have. I have accepted this claim and
rejected the Respondent’s defences to it.
On each rental payment she paid
GST and I have also concluded that she is entitled to an amount to reflect the
fact that with lower
lease payments she would have paid less GST on these.
16 Although Ms Capic made a claim for damages for inconvenience,
distress and vexation in her pleadings she did not pursue it in her
submissions
and I make no award for it.
The group claim
DPS6 was fitted in 73,451 vehicles imported into Australia by the Respondent. I
will call this cohort the ‘Affected
Vehicles’. These vehicles
consisted of the model lines of the Focus, Fiesta and EcoSport and the dates
they were supplied
new range from 22 September 2010 to 29 December
2017. The group consists principally of the persons who purchased these
new together with subsequent second hand purchasers between
1 January 2011 and 29 November 2018. The Applicant estimated
approximately 185,000 people in the group by reasoning that each car
had been owned on average by 2.5 persons in this time.
18 The picture is much more complex in the case of the group than it is in
the case of Ms Capic. The vehicles were manufactured by
Respondent’s parent, Ford Motor Company (‘Ford US’). As
the problems with the DPS6 became apparent Ford US
worked to resolve them.
As a solution became available it was gradually implemented in vehicles which
were already on the road.
However, this was only done where the vehicles
presented for service with a problem (except in the case of 15B22 which was
when vehicles were brought in for regular servicing). This approach
is known as a ‘fix on fail’ approach. Ford US also
its manufacturing processes so that the fixes were applied in new vehicles.
Turning to the particular problems advanced
by the Applicant:
Input shaft seals
19 I am satisfied that
the Affected Vehicles which were supplied with the original input shaft seals
posed a risk of failure and that
all of these vehicles were at the time of their
supply not of acceptable quality.
20 Where the original input shaft seals have not been replaced no question
under ACL s 271(6) arises and these group members have
claims under
s 271(1) for reduction in value damages under s 272(1)(a) and (if
applicable) other reasonably foreseeable loss and
damage under s 272(1)(b)
21 Where the input shaft seals have been replaced with seals containing both
the new FKM elastomer and a steel outer backing on the
inner seal, I accept that
each relevant group member ‘required’ the repair within the meaning
of s 271(6). However,
in these cases the issue of whether the repair was
effected within a reasonable time was not the subject of the present trial.
parties eschewed any attempt to prove whether group members’ vehicles
had been repaired within a reasonable time by asserting
that the other bore the
burden of proving this matter. The effect of this impasse was that there is no
evidence before the Court
on the topic. Had either party attempted to prove
this matter it would have been immediately apparent that it could not have been
tried as a common issue since it turns on the individual position of each group
member. For this reason the only conclusion is that
the matter was not tried
and could not have been tried as a common issue.
22 Consequently, it cannot presently be known whether these group members
have claims for reduction in value damages although the
prima facie position is
that they may have claims for other reasonably foreseeable loss and damage under
ACL s 272(1)(b). This conclusion
availability of reduction in value damages does not apply in those vehicles
where an input
shaft seal was replaced with one containing only the new FKM
elastomer but not the new steel backing on the inner seal.
Clutch lining
23 I am satisfied that
each vehicle which was supplied with the original clutch lining material (known
as B8080) suffered from a risk
of developing symptoms such that it did not
comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality.
24 Some of the Affected Vehicles supplied with this material have never had
it replaced. I am satisfied that each such group member
has a cause of action
under s 271(1) for reduction in value damages under s 272(1)(a) and if
applicable for other reasonably foreseeable
loss or damage under s
25 Some of the Affected Vehicles supplied with this material have since
received replacement clutches using lining material known
as RCF1o. I am
satisfied that this replacement has removed the relevant risk of symptoms. The
Respondent then seeks to rely on
s 271(6) to defeat such a group
member’s claim for reduction in value damages. I am satisfied that each
such group member
‘required’ the Respondent to repair the vehicle,
however, the issue of whether it did so within a reasonable time was
in the present trial. Its outcome will turn in each case on
particular group member required the Respondent to repair the problem and when,
in fact, the Respondent did so. Since that issue
was not tried it is not
presently known whether the Respondent has a defence to a claim for reduction in
value damages under s 271(6)
in the case of such a group member. This will
not be known until the individual position of each group member is ascertained.
as with the input shaft seals, s 271(6) does not affect a group
member’s entitlement to seek compensation for reasonably foreseeable
or damage other than reduction in value damages, ie under s 272(1)(b).
26 Some vehicles received a replacement clutch known as a half-hybrid
B8040/B8080 clutch rather than an RCF1o clutch. I am not satisfied
Respondent has proved that this half-hybrid clutch eliminated the risk.
Consequently, no question under s 271(6) can arise.
It follows that these
group members do have claims for reduction in value damages as well as for other
reasonably foreseeable loss
and damage under s 272(1)(b).
27 Not all of the vehicles were supplied with B8080. Some were supplied with
the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch. I am not satisfied
that the Applicant has
demonstrated that this material posed the risks of failure she alleges and hence
I am not satisfied that these
group members have a claim for damages in respect
of their clutch lining. It will be noted that I have already rejected the
Respondent’s
reliance on s 271(6) with respect to the half-hybrid
clutch. In effect, both parties failed to prove anything useful about the
half-hybrid
28 In the case of the vehicles which were supplied with RCF1o the group
members do not have a claim in respect of the clutch lining.
29 The case based on the
ATIC 106 chips fails on the facts. However, the case based on the original
ATIC 91 chip is viable. Not
all of the Affected Vehicles were supplied
with a TCM containing an ATIC 91 chip attended by a risk of solder
cracking. Affected
Vehicles supplied with a TCM with the revised ATIC 91 chip
were not in breach of the guarantee of acceptable quality for this reason
their owners do not have a claim under s 271(1) in respect of it.
30 The vehicles supplied with TCMs containing the original ATIC 91 chip were
not of acceptable quality at the time of their supply
because of the risks they
posed. The Respondent applied two fixes. First, each vehicle which was
presented for service after 27
October 2015 received a software update
known as 15B22. It did not address the physical problem of solder cracking but
it detected
that problem before the symptoms associated with it became
perceptible to the driver and disabled the vehicle in a sufficiently confronting
way, attended with warning lights and messages, that it may be accepted that a
driver would take the vehicle in for service almost
immediately and without
fail. Secondly, once new TCMs with the revised ATIC 91 chip became
available these were inserted into vehicles
which showed symptoms of TCM failure
or which had been brought in for service due to the operation of the warning
system instituted
by the 15B22 software update.
31 The first fix was effective in those vehicles into which it was installed
where replacement TCMs with the revised ATIC 91 chip
were available in
service stock but not effective in those vehicles in which it was not installed
or where it was installed without
the corresponding availability in service of
TCMs with the revised ATIC 91 chip. The second and third class of these
have claims
for reduction in value damages if their original TCM was not
otherwise replaced. It is not known whether the first class have claims
reduction in value damages in respect of this issue because, while I accept that
the installation was an effective repair for
the purposes of s 271(6) where
new TCMs were available as replacements in service, the issue of whether the
repair took place within
a reasonable time has not been tried nor has it been
shown for each group member that replacement TCMs with the revised ATIC 91
were in fact available.
32 The replacement of the original TCM with a new TCM with the revised
ATIC 91 chip was a successful repair and removed the risk posed
original TCM. However, in the case of each such group member it is not
presently known whether the replacement was effected
within a reasonable time.
It cannot presently be known whether these group members have claims for
reduction in value damages.
Rear main oil seal
33 The group members have
not established that any of the Affected Vehicles had an inherent risk of
failure due to the rear main oil
seal. This claim fails.
Inadequate heat management
34 The group members have
not established that their vehicles had an inherent risk of failure because of
the way in which heat was
managed in the DPS6. This claim fails.
Rattling gears and slight shudder at low speeds
35 I am satisfied that
all Affected Vehicles have a risk that they will develop these symptoms due to
the manner in which the DPS6
damps torsional vibrations. I have concluded that
the Affected Vehicles do not comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality
of this issue. The Respondent has not attempted to resolve this.
36 The group members sought damages on an aggregate
basis under
s 33Z(1)(f)
Federal Court of Australia Act 1976
(Cth) (‘FCA Act’). Such an award may only be made if the Court
is satisfied that a reasonably accurate assessment can
be made of the total
amount to which group members will be entitled: s 33Z(3). Since it is not
presently known which group members
have which causes of action for reduction in
value damages the question of whether there can be aggregation under this
does not yet arise. The claim is therefore refused on the current
state of the case. If and when the issue of whether the various
repairs were
effected within a reasonable time is resolved, this question may be
37 For reasons explained more fully in Section XIV, this conclusion is not
disturbed by either of the following matters:
38 First, that all group members have causes of action in relation to the
risks of rattling gears and a slight shudder at low speeds
which I have
concluded are caused by inadequate torsional damping. This was a comparatively
minor issue when compared with the Applicant’s
case on the Component
Deficiencies. In any event, an award of aggregate damages cannot be made unless
the Court can arrive at a
reasonably accurate assessment of the
amount to which group members are entitled under the judgment: FCA Act
s 33Z(3). This is not possible for reasons I have just outlined.
39 Secondly, that the group’s aggregate damages claim incorporated
amounts for alleged excess finance and tax and repair time
costs, comprising
other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage under s 272(1)(b). While the
entitlement to damages under that provision
does not depend on the continued
existence of a cause of action for reduction in value damages, nonetheless it is
not possible to
make a reasonably accurate assessment of group members’
entitlement. In any event, as I explain in Section XIV, any
assessment of excess finance and tax losses cannot be undertaken until
quantum of any entitlement to reduction in value damages is known. The result
therefore is that there can yet be no award of
aggregate damages.
40 Finally, before moving to the substantive issues in the case, it should be
recorded that this trial was conducted during the Victorian
lockdown in 2020 in
circumstances of considerable hardship for both parties, their lawyers and those
working within the Court. The
entire 6 week trial was conducted by means of a
virtual platform with not a single appearance in a court room by any person.
required a high degree of co-operation between the legal representatives
for the parties. Whilst no doubt the trial was conducted
with little quarter
given by either side to the other, this formal hostility did not extend to
facilitating the orderly conduct of
the trial in the difficult circumstances of
the pandemic. The Court records its thanks to the representatives of the
parties for
bringing the matter to trial in this fashion.
SECTION II: THE AFFECTED VEHICLES
41 The Affected Vehicles
consist of 73,451 separate vehicles manufactured by Ford US under the model
lines Focus, Fiesta and EcoSport
during the period between July 2010 and
December 2016. Each of the vehicles was manufactured either in Rayong in
Thailand, Saarlouis
in Germany or Chennai in India. Each of the vehicles is
equipped with the DPS6 transmission. Further, each of the vehicles was
the Respondent through Ford Australia dealerships to consumers in the Australian
42 Apart from the three model lines, the vehicles may relevantly be further
sub-categorised by reference to their year of production
and their engine size.
In the case of production year, there can be a lag of up to one year between the
time a vehicle is physically
assembled at a Ford plant and the time at which it
is eventually sold. Whilst sometimes the model year of a vehicle can be the
as the production year this is not inevitably so and for some vehicles the
model year is the year following the production year.
This is so, for example,
in the case of the Affected Vehicles bearing a 2017 model year, as all were
produced in 2016.
43 The Applicant’s submissions summarised the composition of the fleet
of Affected Vehicles in Table 1 of her submissions which
is based upon
production year:
44 A table was also prepared by reference to model year (as opposed to
production year):
45 The Respondent’s submissions contained a similar set of tables which
very marginally differed. After judgment was reserved
I queried the parties as
to the discrepancy. On 6 August 2020, my Associate was informed by the
parties that the Court should rely
upon the tables in the Applicant’s
submissions. The minor discrepancy related to the inclusion in the
Respondent’s figures
of some vehicles which had never been sold. For that
reason, I will act on the basis of the tables I have just set out.
46 The Ford Focus constitutes the largest segment of the Affected Vehicles
(57.9%) followed by the Fiesta (34.2%) and the EcoSport
(7.9%). The small
number of EcoSports involved is a reflection, in part, of the fact that it did
not enter production until 2013.
It will also be noted that there is a
significant decline in the number of Affected Vehicles manufactured after 2014.
Most of the
Affected Vehicles (88.6%) were manufactured between 2010 and 2014
and 11.4% were manufactured in 2015 and 2016.
47 Next it is useful to note where these vehicles are located in the wider
market for all vehicles. The Fiesta and EcoSport are what
are known as
B-segment vehicles whilst the Focus is a C-segment vehicle. Both B- and
C-segment vehicles are designed to be lightweight,
fuel efficient and relatively
inexpensive to purchase and operate in comparison to larger and more expensive
vehicles in the D-segment
(eg the Audi A4) or the E-segment (eg the
Mercedes-Benz E-class). C-segment vehicles are generally larger than B-segment
The Focus is larger than the Fiesta but similar in size to the
EcoSport. B- and C-segment vehicles are typically equipped with
smaller engines
between 1.0 and 2.0 litres in size.
48 Although the tables above refer to engine size without discrimination
between engine type, there is a debate between the parties
‘dual mass flywheels’. I need not explain what that debate is at
this point (see Section X below)
although it concerns the kind of flywheel
connecting the crankshaft to the drive plate (I explain these terms below at
Section IV).
49 The flywheel debate does make it necessary, as a matter of background, to
understand that, with the exception of the 1.0L Fiesta,
all the Affected
Vehicles have 4-cylinder engines. Each of these engines was equipped with a
‘single-mass flywheel’.
The 1.0L Fiesta, on the other hand, was
built with a turbocharged 3-cylinder engine (known as the ‘Fox’)
equipped with
a dual mass flywheel. I return to the large topic of dual mass
flywheels and torsional vibrations below at Section X. It forms
a significant
part of the engineering debate between the parties.
50 Within model lines there were further distinctions which reflected
differences in trim or additional functionality. In general,
different levels
of trim can range from the cosmetic (ie, leather seats instead of fabric)
through to improvements in performance
and comfort (ie, increased sound
insulation and better powertrain mount tuning). For the Affected Vehicles,
these different trims
can be identified by each model line’s badge. The
Affected Vehicles include the Fiesta in six different badges (CL, LX, ZETEC,
Ambiente, Trend and Sport), the EcoSport in three (Ambiente, Trend and Titanium)
and the Focus in four (Sport, Ambiente, Trend and
Titanium/Sport). Nothing in
this litigation turns on the differences between badges but since they often
appear in the evidence
it is useful to know what they mean.
51 I was not taken to any evidence directly on this matter, but in
submissions the Applicant referred to there being 64,963 Affected
remaining from the 73,451 once the settled claims had been removed. In any
event the total number of vehicles remaining
in the class is not material at
this stage.
SECTION III: PROCEDURAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAY THE CASE WAS
52 The Applicant’s
case that the Affected Vehicles were not of acceptable quality is principally
found at §6AB of the fourth
further amended statement of claim
(‘4FASOC’). It is a case alleging that the vehicles had a
propensity towards certain
identified misbehaviours. There was no issue in the
case as to whether individual vehicles in the class actually exhibited the
misbehaviours
(although there was in Ms Capic’s individual case).
This interpretation of §6AB reflected the parties’ understanding
it with which the Court had previously agreed:
Capic v Ford Motor Company
[2017] FCA 771
. Any inquiry into the individual
position of vehicles within the class would not have presented common issues
suitable for determination
in a class action trial. The Applicant did not
therefore seek to prove the individual position of vehicles within the cohort.
is true that the Applicant did call 52 other group members to give evidence
was only to give
anecdotal support for her case that the vehicles suffered from the propensities
alleged and to exemplify the expectations
of a reasonable consumer.
53 The case therefore is about the existence of propensities (or risks) of
identified forms of vehicle misbehaviour. The method of
proof selected by the
Applicant was to seek to prove that the propensities or risks existed because of
particular mechanical features
of the DPS6. In an ordinary claim that goods are
not of acceptable quality the question of why they are such is irrelevant. For
example, if I buy a kettle and it does not work, it does not matter why it does
not work. It is not of acceptable quality simply
because it does not work. The
applicant in such a case has no need to prove its design or componentry
deficient, just that it does
not work. However, where a case of unacceptable
quality is pursued on the basis that the goods pose a risk of some kind, the
of the argument necessarily require an identification of some reason
why the risk exists. Ordinarily, this will require some form
of practical
explanation of a problem in construction or design. For example, if an
applicant wishes to prove that a kettle is defective
because it has a 5% risk of
exploding, it will usually be necessary to explain what it is about the kettle
that gives rise to that
risk. The only other alternative would be to rely on
sufficiently robust empirical data to show that in fact 5% of the kettles did
54 The manner in which the Applicant sought to prove the existence of the
risks of the alleged misbehaviours was multi-faceted. She
the evidence of
Dr Jürgen Greiner, a transmissions engineer;
the evidence of
herself and 52 other members of the group as to the difficulties they had had
with their own vehicles;
evidence derived
from warranty claims and complaints data maintained by the Respondent;
produced by Ford US which were referred to by Dr Greiner in his reports;
produced by Ford US which were not referred to by Dr Greiner in his
55 For reasons I explain more fully in Section XVI the Applicant’s case
was that the vehicles suffered from the risks of misbehaviour
identified by Dr
Greiner. This was not the way that §6AB of the 4FASOC was particularised
but the Applicant later notified
the Respondent that she would prove the
existence of the deficiencies through Dr Greiner. By the time the matter came
it was on this basis that it was conducted. The parties chose to make
the correctness of Dr Greiner’s evidence the field of
their dispute which
they were at liberty to do.
56 Dr Greiner referred to a number of documents which had been created by
Ford US and, in relation to these there is no doubt that
the Respondent has been
given an opportunity to meet the Applicant’s case. However, at the end of
the trial the Applicant
tendered a number of Ford US documents not referred to
in Dr Greiner’s evidence without indicating at any time prior to her
closing written submissions what their significance was. As I explain in
Section XVI this is procedurally unfair and will not be
57 In relation to the 52 vehicle owners who were called, I explain in Section
V as to why I do not think I can rely on their evidence
to substantiate the
existence of risks across the Affected Vehicles where the Applicant provided no
evidence as to how these witnesses
had been selected or what the statistical
value of a sample of 52 vehicles from a cohort of 73,451 might be.
58 Consequently the case that the Respondent was required to meet on the
existence of the alleged propensity of the vehicles to misbehave
was the case
consisting of:
Greiner’s evidence including the Ford US documents referred to by
Respondent’s warranty and complaints data and the evidence derived from
59 It is then necessary to identify features of the DPS6 relevant to the
Applicant’s case.
SECTION IV: THE NATURE AND RELEVANT FEATURES OF THE
60 The DPS6 is a dry
dual clutch transmission. A
dual clutch transmission
is a transmission
with two clutches. In the DPS6 one clutch operates the odd numbered gears
(‘clutch 1’) and the other
the even numbered gears along with
reverse (‘clutch 2’). This permits the transmission to have two
gears selected at
once. Clutch 1 is attached to an inner input shaft which is
itself located within a hollow outer input shaft to which clutch 2 is
In both cases, the clutch plate sits between a pressure plate and a central
drive plate. The pressure plates are controlled
by actuators and squeeze the
relevant clutch plate onto the drive plate. The drive plate is connected to the
crankshaft (via a flywheel)
and it is the crankshaft that takes power from the
engine. The clutch plate is connected to the input shaft. When a gear is fully
engaged, the drive plate and the clutch plate move at the same rotational speed
and are pressed onto each other such that power flows
from the crankshaft to the
input shaft and from there through the transmission to the gears to drive the
car. When the vehicle is
moved from a standing position (‘launch’)
or when a gear change is performed, the clutch plate and the drive plate move
different speeds until they are brought to the same speed in the same way as
occurs in a manual transmission. This period of
transition depends on the
frictional qualities of the clutch lining or friction material which lines the
relevant faces of the clutch
plates, the pressure plates and the drive plate.
This material is an important element in the operation of the transmission and
its frictional qualities dictate the manner in which the transmission operates.
Because there are two clutches in a dual clutch
transmission there are four
areas of frictional contact involved, one on each side of the drive plate and
one between each clutch
plate and its respective pressure plate. Below are two
diagrams of the DPS6 architecture. By way of explanation, in the labels
refers to clutch 1 related components and K2 to clutch 2 related components,
while the clutch plates are labelled ‘clutch
disc’ and the drive
plate is labelled ‘central plate’.
61 Because humans do not have three legs, it is generally not feasible for a
dual clutch transmission to be operated by the driver.
In the DPS6 the control
of the two clutches is given over to a computer located on the transmission
control module (‘TCM’).
When the transmission is in one gear it
works out what the next gear change will be and selects that gear whilst the
relevant input
shaft is not connected to the engine (via the drive
plate–clutch plate system). The next change of gear therefore avoids any
delay whilst the new gear is selected and correspondingly there is no need for
an interruption in the delivery of power whilst the
transmission is disengaged
from the drive plate (as occurs in a manual when the clutch is disengaged in
order to allow the driver
to physically shift into the next gear with the
gearstick). A change of gear in the DPS6 therefore only requires a switch of
between the input shafts, brought about by disengaging one clutch plate
while simultaneously engaging the other clutch plate with
the corresponding side
of the drive plate.
62 With that brief discussion in mind, the following concepts are relevant to
this litigation:
Clutch lining
. The surfaces of both sides of
each clutch plate and the drive plate, along with the surfaces of the pressure
plate that face the
clutch plate are lined with the clutch lining material. The
frictional qualities of the clutch lining are, as I have already said,
to the operation of the transmission. The TCM knows what these qualities are
and they are factored into the procedures it
uses for changing gears.
Unpredictable variations in the frictional qualities of the clutch lining
disrupt the process of gear shifts
in ways which are themselves unpredictable.
The frictional qualities of the clutch lining are also affected by heat, that is
say, some clutch lining materials behave differently (and unpredictably) the
hotter the transmission is. This clutch lining is also
referred to
interchangeably in the evidence as
clutch material
Clutch slip
. When the clutch plate and the drive plate are fully
engaged with each other they are pressed together in a state of static friction
and rotate as one so that power passes from the engine through them to the gears
and then on to the wheels. When they are being
introduced to each other, on the
other hand, they move at different speeds until they are brought to the same
speed. The initial
difference in their rotational speeds reflects the fact that
after launch the drive plate will be rotating at a rotational speed
the rotational speed of the crankshaft (with the influence of the flywheel in
between) whereas the clutch plate will not
be rotating at all. As they are
gradually introduced to each other by increasing the pressure exerted on the
clutch plate side (by
a spring loaded pressure plate) the clutch plate begins to
rotate sympathetically with the drive plate until, ultimately, it is rotating
the same speed. Whilst in the transition from not rotating at all (in a state
of full disengagement before launch) to rotating
at the same speed as the drive
plate, the clutch is said to be in slip phase which reflects the fact that the
plates are rotating
at different speeds and therefore necessarily in a state of
kinetic friction. Although this sounds complex, for persons who can
manual vehicle the ideas will be familiar. In particular, in a manual vehicle
the slip phase corresponds to the skill involved
in re-engaging the clutch by
lifting your foot off the clutch pedal following a gear change. Clutch slip is
used during gear changes
but it may also be used as a form of braking. For
example, the practice of ‘riding the clutch’ in a manual vehicle
on a slope so as to keep the vehicle stationary involves keeping the clutch
in a constant state of clutch slip. This practice is
generally regarded as
unsound in a manual vehicle as it wears out the clutch lining and generates
heat. One of the issues in this
case concerns the programming of the TCM to use
clutch slip as a method for damping torsional vibrations. This brings one to
vibrations:
Torsional vibrations
. The pistons in an internal combustion engine
are attached to the crankshaft. Because they fire at different times this means
the crankshaft accelerates as each piston fires and then begins to
decelerate as the explosion finishes and continues to drop off
until the next
piston fires. Although it is usual to say that the crankshaft is rotating at a
particular rate of revolutions per
minute (rpm) this is in fact an incomplete
description of what is occurring. In reality, the rotational speed of the
is not constant but oscillates at a high frequency related to the
rate at which the pistons are firing. The intermittent nature
of the piston
firing also means that the turning force (or torque) output by the crankshaft
also fluctuates. Torsional vibrations
are a product of the fluctuations in both
the speed and torque of the crankshaft. In an internal combustion engine they
of life but can have negative consequences. For example, the
presence of a vibrational oscillation in a vehicle may have unwelcome
consequences if the frequency of the oscillation coincides with a harmonic
frequency of any other component in the vehicle. When
this occurs other
components of the vehicle may begin to rattle. Consequently, at some point some
effort must be made to damp the
torsional vibrations produced by the engine.
There are several ways of doing so. In the DPS6 the TCM was programmed to soak
the torsional vibrations by using clutch slip and also with the use of
‘torsional springs’ known as inner dampers which
were located within
the clutch plates. Other ways exist too, for example, by placing a flywheel on
the crankshaft equipped with
dampers. All of these solutions have strengths and
weaknesses. A flywheel with torsional dampers will reduce torsional vibrations.
But nothing is for free. Such a flywheel is heavy and can affect the
vehicle’s fuel consumption. Further, the same phenomenon
which soaks up
the torsional vibrations also guarantees that more engine power is needed to
drive the crankshaft. This corresponds
with a reduced responsiveness in the
vehicle to applications of power (and an overall reduction in power).
. The TCM is a computer consisting of several integrated
circuits soldered to a printed circuit board and is bolted onto the transmission
housing (which is also referred to as the bell housing). As such it is exposed
to the heat generated by the transmission. The temperature
the DPS6 operates at
depends, inter alia, on the amount of heat generated through the friction
involved in clutch slip. This fluctuates
with the manner and frequency of gear
changes. A vehicle with a lot of gears will have more frequent gear changes and
to run hotter. The picture then is one of fluctuations in
temperature. The integrated circuits and the printed circuit board expand
contract when heated and cooled. For the reasons just given, this occurs very
frequently in a dual clutch transmission. If
they expand and contract at
different rates, this will expose the solder to mechanical strain and may cause
cracking in the solder
over time. Cracking in the solder in turn may cause
electrical conductivity issues which may cause the TCM to behave erratically.
This problem does not occur if the printed circuit board and the integrated
circuits soldered to it have the same coefficient of
thermal expansion, as the
expansion and contraction would then occur at identical rates.
Input shaft seals
. The DPS6 is a dry dual clutch transmission. In
general, dual clutch transmissions may be wet or dry. A wet transmission is one
in which the clutch plates are bathed in a liquid. The purpose of the liquid is
to remove heat from the transmission. A dry dual
clutch assembly is one in
which the clutch and drive plates are not so bathed but are instead cooled by
the surrounding air in the
bell housing, with the rotating clutch plates acting
as fans. One advantage of a dry clutch is that it is lighter and the clutch
plates experience less resistance when rotating (which improves fuel
efficiency). A disadvantage is that air cooling is not as efficient
cooling due to the higher heat capacity of liquids. In a dry clutch
transmission the desired frictional properties of
the clutch lining are premised
on the clutch lining remaining dry. How is this achieved? The input shaft to
which the clutch is
connected is exposed in the gearbox to lubricants. It is
important for the operation of the clutches that these lubricants do not
their way onto the surface of the clutch lining. The clutch plates and drive
plate faces must therefore be sealed from the
gearbox. This is achieved by
means of seals. Relevantly there are two seals, both known as input shaft
seals, which serve this
purpose (one for the inner input shaft and one for the
outer input shaft). If the input shaft seals fail then lubricants may find
their way onto the clutch lining. The presence of fluid on the clutch lining
affects the frictional qualities of the clutch lining
and may cause the clutches
to behave in unpredictable ways.
Rear main oil seal
. The problem just described exists on both sides
of the transmission. Just as the clutch lining must be kept free of
contamination
from lubricants coming from the gearbox side so too must it be
protected from oil contamination coming from the engine side. The
the rear main oil seal is to provide that protection at the point where the
crankshaft exits the engine and enters the
transmission environment.
Heat management
. When a clutch is in its slip phase, the kinetic
friction involved generates heat. Heat may affect the frictional qualities of
the clutch lining. The clutch lining must be such as to perform predictably in
the heat environment in which it finds itself. Where
the clutch lining is not
sufficient in a given temperature environment there are two possible solutions.
Either the clutch lining
material may be changed so that it can operate
predictably in the actual heat environment of the transmission or additional
measures may be introduced into the transmission. For example, one
might change to a wet clutch configuration or, perhaps, increase
the air flow
throughout the transmission by some means (like a fan).
Wet clutch shudder
. The term ‘shudder’ was used in a
somewhat amorphous manner in this litigation to describe undesirable vehicle
that is caused by a number of distinct problems. Wet clutch shudder
is that subset of shudder which is the result of lubricating
fluid contaminating
the clutch lining and causing it to behave unpredictably.
Dry clutch shudder.
In distinction to wet clutch shudder, dry clutch
shudder refers to that shudder emanating from the errant behaviour of clutch
that have not been contaminated with fluid. Within this genus,
‘self-excited shudder’ is that which is linked to the
frictional properties of the clutch lining material, while ‘forced-excited
shudder’ is the result of geometric
variability in the clutch components.
SECTION V: THE WITNESSES
The Applicant’s lay witnesses
63 Ms Capic
gave her evidence in chief by means of three affidavits dated 7 June 2018,
22 November 2019 and 5 May 2020. She was cross-examined
on Thursday
18 June 2020 and Friday 19 June 2020 which were the 4th and 5th days
of the trial. The cross-examination appears at
64 The principal issue about her credit turned on some evidence she gave in
relation to the financing of her vehicle. It is therefore
necessary to
understand that financing before that evidence can be assessed.
65 Ms Capic currently works for herself as a business consultant
providing, inter alia, payroll management and bookkeeping services.
At the time
she gave her evidence she was 35 years old. On 24 December 2012
Ms Capic purchased a 2012 Ford Focus LW MKII Sport
2.0L from Sterling Ford
who traded from Bundoora in Victoria. It was a 5 door hatchback and its colour
was frozen white. In addition,
Ms Capic also paid for tinted windows and
some carpet mats. On top of these costs there were some on-road costs. The
purchase costs
for the vehicle were as follows:
Carpet mats – 3pcs
Window tint
Dealer delivery
66 In addition there were the following on-road expenses:
Registration fee
Compulsory third party
Slimline Plate Fee
67 Thus Ms Capic was required to pay the following amounts on the
acquisition of the vehicle:
Car purchase costs
On-road costs
68 On the same day, Ms Capic entered into a ‘novated finance
lease’ with BMW Australia Finance Ltd (‘BMW Finance’)
which an amount of $27,930.27 was financed. A copy of the terms of this lease
is not available but the evidence does include
an amortisation schedule and it
corroborates Ms Capic’s evidence that the lease was a novated finance
lease. There was no
direct evidence about this but I propose to assume that a
novated finance lease is a hire purchase arrangement where an employer
agrees to meet the rental payments due under a hire purchase arrangement in
relation to a motor vehicle provided to an employee;
but (b) is not obliged to
make the residual payment at the end. Ms Capic gave evidence that at the
time of this first lease she
was employed by IN-Fusion Management Pty Ltd and
that it was a term of her employment agreement that she would be provided with a
car. A copy of that agreement was not in evidence but Ms Capic says that
she entered into a fresh employment contract with IN-Fusion
Management Pty Ltd
on 1 June 2014 in which there was a similar term. That agreement is available.
One of its provisions is as follows:
In addition to your remuneration, you are also provided
with a fully maintained motor vehicle which will operate under a personal
novated lease. IN-Fusion Management will be responsible for meeting all lease
payments on your behalf whilst you are an employee
of the business and; be
responsible for the costs associated with running and maintaining the vehicle
accordingly, for example, Fuel,
Registration, Insurance, Servicing, Tolls and
69 In this case, one can discern from the amortisation schedule which was put
in evidence that the lease had a four year term with
monthly payments of $586.09
(including GST). There was a residual payment of $12,839.20 (including GST) due
at the end of the fourth
year on 24 December 2016. There is a gap of
$664.73 between the total purchase price due to Sterling Ford of $28,595.00 and
amount provided by BMW Finance of $27,930.27. I am unable to account for
this anomaly.
70 In August 2016 Ms Capic’s employer IN-Fusion Management Pty Ltd
went into administration. In the period between 24 August
2016 and 25 October
2016 it appears to have continued to have been debited for the payments under
the lease but on each occasion
the payments were dishonoured. Ms Capic
says, and I accept, that IN-Fusion (or perhaps what had been its business) was
purchased by a new entity, Interstate Enterprises Pty Ltd which
traded as ‘Tecside Group’. Tecside employed Ms Capic
employment contract dated 16 September 2016. It contained this term:
At the time of writing this offer, Tecside will continue
with the current arrangements in relation to your novated lease. We will,
however, reserve the right to incorporate the lease into your salary as a salary
sacrifice arrangement. This will not impact your
current net salary.
71 This was apt to pick up the former arrangement with IN-Fusion. A document
entitled ‘BMW Group Financial Services –
Transaction Inquiry’
printed on 17 September 2019 contains a complete history of the amounts due
and payments made under the
BMW Finance lease. It records that a single payment
of $1765.77 was made on 14 December 2016 which was the amount by which the lease
with BMW Finance had by then fallen into arrears. I infer that this payment was
made by Tecside. This was, however, the only payment
ever made by Tecside
because on 24 December 2016 the BMW Finance lease expired under its own terms.
Tecside’s obligations
to Ms Capic were only to meet the rental payments
and it was not obliged to, and did not, pay the residual amount then due. The
residual was $12,839.20.
72 Ms Capic did not pay the residual either, at least not at that time. BMW
Finance’s Transaction Inquiry document records
that it corresponded with
Ms Capic on 11 January 2017, 20 January 2017 and 28 February
2017 and I infer that is likely to have been
in relation to her obligation to
pay the residual.
73 One may infer that if unattended for a sufficiently long period of time it
is possible that BMW Finance might have repossessed
vehicle under the terms of the finance lease. In any event, by May 2017 it is
clear that steps were underway designed
to secure a new finance lease in the
amount of the outstanding residual due under the BMW Finance lease.
Ms Capic’s evidence
in her affidavit of 7 June 2018 was that she
thought that it was Tecside’s obligation to secure a new finance lease:
She says that on 22 March 2017 she signed an invoice for the sale of
her vehicle. Whilst this is correct it is not an entirely
complete statement.
She was also the person to whom the vehicle on sale was to be supplied to. The
sale price was for the amount
of the residual payment of $12,839.20.
Ms Capic is recorded therefore both as the vendor and as the person to whom
the vehicle was
to be delivered.
74 However, I am satisfied that no such transaction occurred on 22 March
2017. As I shortly explain, Ms Capic did not obtain finance
until 29 May 2017
and I do not think Ms Capic could, or at least would, have paid out the first
lease until the second lease was
entered into. A more likely explanation for
the date of this document is that it is a document which was, for some reason,
necessary to facilitate the second lease.
75 That second lease was procured, and in fact probably advanced, by
Ms Capic’s finance broker, Mr Crea. According to her evidence,
had been in touch with her and had impressed upon her the need quickly to
refinance the amount due to BMW Finance. Under cross-examination
she said that
it was Mr Crea’s company Melbourne Finance Broking Pty Ltd which had
refinanced the residual. Certainly the
lease that began 29 May 2017 suggests
that the lessor was Melbourne Finance Broking Pty Ltd as trustee for the
Melbourne Finance
Broking Unit Trust. Puzzlingly, however, subsequent demands
for payment appear to have come from Macquarie Leasing Pty Ltd (‘Macquarie
Leasing’) but it was not a party to the second finance lease. A letter
from Macquarie Leasing dated 11 November 2019 seems
to record a payment
having been received on 30 May 2017. Furthermore, another letter from
Macquarie Leasing dated 13 November 2019
appears to be, at first glance, a
record that the first monthly payment of $368.18 had been made by Ms Capic
to Macquarie Leasing
on 29 May 2017. That might suggest that Macquarie
Leasing has been the lessor on that day which is the same date as the lease with
Melbourne Finance Broking. However, closer examination does not bear this out.
The document is in fact merely an amortisation schedule
and bears an annotation
‘This is not a payment history or statement of account and therefore does
not reflect actual payment
activity on your contract’. It would be unsafe
to rely on this document to infer that Macquarie Leasing was first paid on
76 At T261.16 Ms Capic gave evidence that she thought, based on the
documents, that Melbourne Finance Broking had paid out the first
lease but that
subsequently a new lease had been entered into. I do not think Ms Capic was
purporting to give this evidence as an
explicit exercise in recollection;
rather, it was an attempt to explain why Melbourne Finance Broking appeared to
have been the lessor
on 29 May 2017.
77 There is clearly a missing piece in the evidence. There are only two
available explanations. Either Melbourne Finance Broking
novated the second
lease to Macquarie Leasing or a fresh, third, lease was entered into with
Macquarie Leasing which was used to
refinance the second lease with Melbourne
Finance Broking. Ms Capic’s reconstruction of events is consistent with
but I do not think her speculation is especially probative. As will
be seen, it is not necessary to resolve this issue, although
I would express a
preference for the novation theory were it necessary – it seems more
consistent with the absence of any evidence
of a third lease. What is
important, however, is that on either view, Melbourne Finance Broking was to be
the lessor on 26 May 2017
and this means that it (and Mr Crea) were acting
in that capacity on that day.
78 The second lease was a 3 year finance lease requiring the payment of 36
instalments of $386.18. Shortly after the second finance
lease was executed (on
26 May 2017) Ms Capic was made redundant by Tecside. This occurred in
June 2017. Tecside agreed however
to continue to meet the lease payments under
the second lease until 30 November 2017. I infer that it made no payments
date. Consistently with the drawing of that inference, Macquarie
Leasing wrote to Ms Capic on 29 January 2018 pointing out her account
had fallen into arrears. This letter confirms that at least by then the lessor
was no longer Melbourne Finance Broking although
it does not explain how that
came to be.
79 Ms Capic then began meeting the lease payments herself. The second
(novated) or perhaps third (new) lease was due to expire on
29 May 2020 at
which time she was bound to make a residual payment of $6,355.40. A few weeks
before that day dawned, Ms Capic had
already affirmed at §20(a) in her
affidavit of 5 May 2020 that she felt financially trapped by her finance lease.
said that between the date of that affidavit and 29 May 2020 (a period
of only 24 days) she would shortly have to meet the residual
payment and the
then single remaining monthly instalment under the second (or perhaps third)
lease. At trial she confirmed that
she had in fact made these payments:
80 It is then useful to turn to the credit attack which the Respondent
launched across this somewhat dry ground. It submitted that
Ms Capic had given
evidence about her entry into the second finance lease which was not to her
credit. The submission went this
way: on 26 May 2017, her finance broker had
sent her documents to be executed for the second lease and she had completed
One of the documents was the lease itself which she signed. The
document contained a section under which Ms Capic was asked to give
a number of
acknowledgements and warranties. Clause 3 was as follows:
Except for any defects disclosed in Item 4 of Schedule
1, the Goods are of merchantable quality and free from defect.
81 But no defect had been notified in the schedule. This was submitted to be
surprising because Ms Capic had by then commenced this
proceeding (on 17 May
2016) just over a year before. In the proceeding she already had alleged, at
§19 of her original Statement
of Claim, that her vehicle suffered from a
number of identified problems and was not of acceptable quality within the
ACL s 54. She found herself in the position therefore of having
alleged in this class action that the vehicle was defective but
afterwards warranted to Melbourne Finance Broking that the vehicle was of
merchantable quality and free from defect. This
involves a potential
inconsistency.
82 Ms Capic was extensively cross-examined about the inconsistency at
T257-258 and her evidence was ultimately that she had in fact
verbally told her
broker, Mr Crea, about the defects. She was also criticised for not mentioning
the fact that she had done so in
any of her affidavits. Whilst I do not think
Ms Capic is to be criticised for not mentioning the matter in her
affidavits, I do
not accept her evidence that she told Mr Crea of the
problems with the vehicle for two reasons. First, Ms Capic had an
not to tell Mr Crea about the difficulties with the vehicle.
Secondly, it seems doubtful had Mr Crea been informed of the problems
the vehicle as Ms Capic then perceived them that he would have extended the
finance to her.
As to her failure to include her discussion with Mr Crea in any of
her affidavits
: I do not think this especially remarkable. Whether
Ms Capic told Mr Crea about the vehicle’s problems does not
any issue in her case in chief. It was not raised in any of the
Respondent’s evidence. It only finally became relevant once
Respondent decided to make a credit issue out of it during the
cross-examination.
As to her motive not to tell Mr Crea about the problems with the
: by 26 May 2017 Ms Capic was in need of finance. The residual
under the BMW Finance lease had been due for many months and BMW Finance
written to her several times after the lease had expired. It is reasonable to
infer that at some point BMW Finance would have
looked to its rights. By 26 May
2017, Ms Capic had been in default for 5 months by not paying the residual. She
may have been right
that it was Tecside’s responsibility to organise
another lease (I offer no view on that question) but, at the end of the day,
BMW Finance repossessed the vehicle after the non-payment of the residual, it
was in a real sense, her problem. I think it fair
to infer in that circumstance
that she had a real motive to organise the second lease and that this need had
become more pressing
by 26 May 2017.
85 Furthermore, by May 2017 Ms Capic’s perception of her vehicle was
negative. The car was serviced on 30 May 2017 very shortly
after the date she
signed the second lease. Her evidence in her affidavit of 7 June 2018 was
that she had told the Ford dealer when
it was serviced on that day that the
vehicle was displaying the usual problems, ie shuddering, not enough power,
vibration and an
inability to take off. On this occasion the dealer replaced
the clutch and input shaft seals. In her affidavit of 5 May 2020, she
at §20(b) that she could not in good conscience sell the car to another
person. She had earlier stated this in her affidavit
of 7 June 2018 at
§153. Irrespective of the mechanical realities of Ms Capic’s
vehicle, there seems little doubt that
she was subjectively deeply dissatisfied
with it. One does not, after all, start a class action on a whim. I infer that
time Ms Capic entered into the second lease on 26 May 2017, she
thought her vehicle was something she could not in good conscience
another person. Although her evidence to that effect was only forthcoming in
her 7 June 2018 affidavit, I do not think that
at this point this was a
revelation at which she had only recently arrived. It seems to me that it is
likely to have been her view
since at least the commencement of the class
86 Ms Capic found herself in the position on 26 May 2017 of needing
the finance to avoid difficulties with BMW Finance but being the
vehicle about which she had grave doubts. Revelation of the problems her
vehicle presented to Mr Crea might well have
led, in Ms Capic’s
perception, to Melbourne Finance Broking refusing to refinance the residual.
And, for the reasons I have
already given, the situation by May 2017 was such
that Ms Capic had been in default with BMW Finance for some months. These
factors gave Ms Capic incentives not to tell Mr Crea about the
difficulties with the vehicle. I do not disregard the fact that Ms
denied that she had kept the matter from Mr Crea in order to ensure that
the finance would be forthcoming, saying at T263.4
under cross-examination that
she had not thought of that ‘until you [ie, the cross-examiner] just
mentioned that now’.
I accept that it is unlikely she set out
deliberately to keep this from Mr Crea. A more likely scenario is that the
two incentives
lingered at the fringe of her conscious mind and merely edged her
towards non-disclosure without her ever forming a complete thought
would not disclose.
87 As to the unlikelihood of Mr Crea extending finance if informed of
the problems with the vehicle: Ms Capic was seeking to refinance
the residual
under the BMW Finance lease. This was an amount of $12,839.20. Although some
care should be exercised in assuming
that this figure represented the
depreciated value of Ms Capic’s vehicle by 26 May 2017 (the
rates of depreciation set for
tax purposes are usually higher than actual
depreciation rates so as to encourage the replacement of equipment and hence
growth) nevertheless it is a useful benchmark by which to gauge the
value of the car even if only in a rough way. It is sufficient,
for example, to
conclude that for the amount being borrowed the loan to value ratio would have
been reasonably high and hence the
quality of the security was important. The
revelation to Mr Crea that the vehicle was beset with the difficulties
Capic was complaining in 2017 would have affected the
potential realisable value of the only security she was offering. It is
to see that it would have been in the interests of Mr Crea to
extend the finance without knowing quite a bit more about what the
difficulties
were. Since Melbourne Finance Broking was the initial lender under the second
lease this was not just a problem which
could be waved through to some
unfortunate third-party financier. Just as BMW Finance was
Ms Capic’s real problem, so too
it would have been
Mr Crea’s real problem if he had lent against the vehicle’s
capital value knowing, as on this hypothesis
he would have, that it suffered
from multiple problems and knowing, as he would have, that Ms Capic was in
default under the BMW
Finance lease. It is possible Mr Crea might have
proceeded despite these problems, but it strikes me as unlikely.
88 These matters lead me to conclude that Ms Capic did not tell
Mr Crea about the difficulties with her vehicle. Her evidence at
that she did was therefore false.
89 It is difficult to think that this episode was to her credit although, in
fairness to her, it is tolerably clear what happened.
The fact that the defects
had not been disclosed by her was a fact that she understandably felt
embarrassed about and she was keen,
I think, to come across – as she
believes herself to be – as an honest person. The irony of the situation
do not think that her failure to disclose the defects in the financing
documents reflected any deliberate dishonesty on her part.
I accept that she
most likely signed the lease without appreciating the significance of the
warranty as many people would. In her
efforts to appear honest on this issue
regrettably Ms Capic was not telling the truth. The situation she found
herself in during
cross-examination was a difficult one and Mr Scerri
QC’s cross-examination of her was searching and stern. It must have been
a stressful occasion for her and this incident is, in some sense, unfortunate
since it was unnecessary. The cross-examination persisted
on the issue for
several pages. Ultimately Ms Capic tried to say at T262.39-40 that she
thought that the word ‘defect’
‘meant something where
it’s physically broken or, you know, can’t turn the car on or
something along those lines....’.
This answer did not strike me as very
plausible. My impression was that by this stage of questioning Ms Capic
was quite distressed
and was, in some ways, flailing around.
90 I think I am bound to accept the Respondent’s submission that the
cross-examination showed that Ms Capic, when presented
with evidence which
was not helpful to her case, would provide answers designed to advance her case.
Ultimately the Respondent submitted
that Ms Capic was ‘a generally
honest although unreliable witness’. I accept this submission. Her
evidence about what
she told Mr Crea does not persuade me that
Ms Capic is at the core of matters a dishonest person but it does persuade
me that when
pushed into a corner in the witness box her answers might not
always be reliable.
91 There is also some reason to think that Ms Capic, at least in
relation to the topic of her car about which she clearly feels strongly
occasion be carried along towards some overstatement. This is not an uncommon
human trait and I think it reflects her passion
for the cause rather than any
underlying desire to deceive. A similar problem besets recreational
92 The Respondent instanced a number of examples of this. The first
concerned Ms Capic’s account of an incident she experienced
3 February 2016. She said that she had been driving on the Eastlink
Freeway when her vehicle lost power and rapidly decelerated
from 80 km/h to
20 km/h in ‘three to five seconds’. Under cross-examination
she stated it was ‘a few seconds’
before clarifying that by this she
meant approximately three to five seconds. The Respondent made two submissions
The first was that it was implausible that the vehicle
would have decelerated at such a rate. Ms Capic’s counsel submitted
that there was no evidence to support such a proposition. I was initially
attracted to that observation but upon reflection I have
changed my mind about
it. There is no doubt that an incident did occur on 3 February 2016 and,
as I explain elsewhere, that the
incident was most likely caused by the TCM
solder issue. However, whilst there is evidence that the TCM solder issue
sometimes resulted
in sudden power losses there is no evidence that it resulted
in powerful braking action. A reduction in speed from 80 km/h to 20
km/h in 3-5
seconds is not a circumstance which could result from a power loss but would
appear to require the presence of braking
action. Accepting that braking action
in a car with gears and a clutch can be achieved by dropping gears there is no
evidence that
the TCM solder issue caused such a symptom and there is also no
reason to think that it affected the braking system itself. I therefore
think that it is possible that Ms Capic’s car decelerated on 3
February 2016 from 80 km/h to 20 km/h in 3-5 seconds
as she initially
affirmed in her affidavit.
93 I am fortified in that conclusion because it is Ms Capic’s own
evidence that the vehicle lost power during the incident which
shows that she
was not trying to say that the vehicle suddenly decided to apply the brakes or
to brake by unexpectedly shifting down
gears. Put another way, I accept
Ms Capic’s evidence that there was a power loss but I do not accept
her initial evidence
that this resulted in the rate of deceleration which she
94 There is therefore something in the Respondent’s submission that her
evidence about this involved some exaggeration.
95 Ms Capic did not submit that her initial evidence could be explained
by the fact that stressful physical events often result in
distorted perceptions
of time. On this view, having one’s car suddenly start slowing down for
no reason on a freeway would
be a stressful event and her perception that the
car decelerated more rapidly than in fact it did could be explained by the
effects of human psychology. There is a question in relation to such a
submission as to whether the distorted timing effect would
have resulted in her
perception of time speeding up (and the incident seeming shorter in her memory)
or slowing down (and the incident
seeming longer). Some literature in this
area, and my own personal experience after a lifetime of minor misadventures,
might suggest
that it is the latter effect in which case one would expect that
Ms Capic’s perception would have been that the vehicle decelerated
over a longer period (and hence that it decelerated more slowly). Since neither
party made a submission about this matter and since
it involves some
considerations of human psychology about which the Court has no evidence it
would not be safe to venture into any
further consideration of it, interesting
though it may be: cf Hancock PA and Weaver JL, ‘On Time Distortions under
(2005) 6(2)
Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science
193-211; Langer J, Wapner S and Werner H, ‘The Effect of Danger upon
the Experience of Time'
(1961) 74(1)
The American Journal of Psychology
I have considered whether it might lie within a legitimate area of
judicial notice within the meaning of
Evidence Act 1995
(Cth) but I do not think that the requirements of that provision can be
engaged in this instance and I do not think that I should
reason that my own
experiences are universally shared.
96 I therefore accept the Respondent’s submission that
Ms Capic’s initial evidence about the rapidity of the deceleration
her vehicle was exaggerated. In the scheme of human drama, it was not one of
the great exaggerations but an exaggeration it nevertheless
97 The second example of exaggeration relied upon by the Respondent concerned
a Facebook Messenger message she sent on 17 February
2016 to Ford’s
Facebook Page. Relevantly it was as follows:
I have had issues with my Ford Focus 2012 since it was
purchased. 3 years later, after numerous services and replacement of different
parts regarding the transmission issue, I still continue to have the same issue
but this time very serious and unsafe. It is a major
failure and an extreme road
safety hazard. It needs to be taken off the road for the safety of all
98 I do not think that Ms Capic’s car has ever been ‘an
extreme road safety hazard’. As the Respondent pointed
out she continued
to use the car throughout the period between this message and the trial,
including to transport her parents, niece
and friends in it. I think that if Ms
Capic really thought the vehicle represented an extreme road safety hazard (her
words) then
it is unlikely she would have driven it herself and even less likely
that she would have driven her friends and relatives.
99 One may perhaps argue about whether the vehicle did pose a safety issue (I
resolve that issue in these reasons at Section VIII)
but I do not think that the
word ‘extreme’ is, or ever has been, apposite. No doubt in the
context of chat groups devoted
to complaining about Ford vehicles participants
can, from time to time, in the heady atmosphere of shared consumer anger get a
over excited. In such an environment a tendency for the participants to
reach for their pitchforks is, perhaps, common. I tend
to think that
Ms Capic’s message can be placed in this category. Does this too
show that she is perhaps prone to exaggeration?
I think I must accept that to
an extent she can be. I also think, however, the context in which the message
occurred needs to be
taken into account.
100 On the other hand, I reject a third example the Respondent proffered of
Ms Capic’s tendencies towards exaggeration. It
submitted that she
had exaggerated the extent of the difficulties which manifested themselves
within a few weeks of acquiring the
vehicle. She had said in her affidavit of
7 June 2018 that she had applied the brakes and the vehicle had begun to
shake and that
the shaking was sufficient to move papers on the dashboard. The
Respondent submitted that Ms Capic had done nothing about this problem
than to raise it at the next service which occurred approximately two and a half
months after the incident. I do not think
that her decision to wait until then
shows that her evidence about this is exaggerated. Many people probably would
wait until the
next service if faced with such a problem.
101 Having regard to these matters I therefore conclude that Ms Capic is
an essentially honest witness. However, she is capable like
many people of some
degree of exaggeration. I also think that her desire to present as a good and
honest witness led her into a
situation in relation to the finance lease where
unfortunately the desire became an impediment to its own fulfilment. I
propose to approach her evidence with some care although not without
also some sympathy. For completeness, I reject the submission
that whatever
defects might have appeared in her evidence under cross-examination were, to an
extent, to be explained because the
questions she had been asked were unclear.
Evidence always looks less coherent on the printed page when it is stripped of
its timing,
body language and surrounding context. A quick perusal of the
transcript of the oral closing submissions will make that point.

The Applicant’s other lay witnesses
102 The Applicant led
evidence from 52 other group members about the difficulties they had had with
their cars. She did not lead
any evidence as to how these 52 witnesses had been
selected from the owners of the 64,963 vehicles that have not had their claims
103 The Applicant submitted that these witnesses were relevant because they
provided ‘anecdotal confirmation, at a human level’
Dr Greiner’s evidence that the vehicles were defective was correct.
The Respondent submitted for the evidence of these
witnesses to be of any use it
would be necessary to show that the sample of 52 group members was in some way
representative of the
group as a whole. To the extent that the Applicant sought
to suggest that the 52 witnesses threw light on what reasonable consumers
expect (which is relevant to the analysis required by
of the ACL)
there was likewise no evidence which could support the conclusion that these 52
consumers were relevantly representative.
104 The Applicant submitted that the evidence of the 52 witnesses as to their
reactions to the difficulties exhibited by their vehicles
was relevant. It was
submitted that evidence of that kind had been received from class members in
Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan
[2000] FCA 1099
; 102 FCR 307 at 445
per Lindgren J (with whom Lee J agreed at 330 [69]). I do not accept
this submission. What Lindgren J said
at 445 [533]-[534] was this:
The words ‘‘as it is reasonable to
expect’’ suggests a question as to the identity of the person or
the reasonableness of whose expectation is in question and is to be
determined by the court. Possible contenders are:
(1) the consumer or other person who suffers loss or damage;
(2) a reasonable consumer placed as that actual consumer or other person
(3) a reasonable bystander (in effect, the court).
In my opinion consistently with both the objective nature of the standard aimed
for and the consumer protection purpose of the provision,
it is the second or
third category of person whose reasonable expectation is called into service by
the statute, and in my opinion
a reasonable bystander would seek to put himself
or herself in the position of a reasonable consumer placed as the actual
or other person was. Accordingly, it is right to inquire into the
reasonable expectations of a category (2) person.
105 This passage does not establish that the expectations of a selection of
the consumers are relevant to the inquiry. Indeed, it
seems explicit that
Lindgren J was suggesting that that evidence be put to one side in undertaking
the inquiry into what the expectations
of a reasonable consumer in the position
of the class member would be. I reject the submission.
106 More generally, I do not accept that this evidence can be of assistance
when the method of selection has not been established.
International College Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
[2018] FCAFC 155
266 FCR 631
the Full Court concluded that evidence as to
the position of 6 consumers out of 3,600 was not sufficiently probative to be
where the Commission had led no evidence as to how the 6 had been
selected or as to how they were otherwise representative of the
population of
consumers. Although the context was different, the difference is not material.
In effect, the Applicant’s submission
that the material was relevant in an
‘anecdotal’ manner is the key point. The Court does not make
findings of fact applicable
to a class of persons based only on the anecdotal
evidence of an unrepresentative number of them.
107 Since I cannot conceive that these witnesses will assist my determination
of whether the risks alleged by the Applicant were inherent
across the Affected
Vehicles nor my assessment of the position of a reasonable consumer, I do not
propose to spend any more time
on their evidence.
The Respondent’s lay witnesses
Mr Karageorgiou
108 Between
2009 and 2014 Michael Karageorgiou was the Service Engineering Operations
Manager (‘SEO Manager’) of Ford
Australia and was responsible for
the markets in Australia and New Zealand. He made an affidavit dated
1 October 2019 to which there
were some minor objections. He was called by
the Respondent on the 9th day of the trial, Thursday 25 June 2020 and gave
over two days. He was examined in chief at T509-516, cross-examined at
T517-608 and re-examined at T609-614.
109 Mr Karageorgiou was first employed by the Respondent in 1998 and
remains employed by it. Since 1998 he has held a number of roles
Ford Group. Most recently he has been working in China in roles relating to the
customer experience in the Asia-Pacific.
Mr Karageorgiou was the first of
three SEO Managers who worked for the Respondent during the period from 2011 to
the present (which
includes the period during which the Affected Vehicles were
sold). He was succeeded by Mr Cruse in 2014 and Mr Cruse was
by Mr Nethercote in 2018. All three were called by the
Respondent to testify on its behalf.
110 Mr Karageorgiou holds a bachelor’s degree in aerospace
engineering and another in business. He also holds a master’s
business administration. He gave evidence about his role as the SEO Manager
during the period 2011 to July 2014 including
a cross-over period in July 2014
when he handed the role over to Mr Cruse. He explained the service
engineering operations of the
Respondent and gave evidence about the nature of
the DPS6 transmission including its handling characteristics. He explained that
the DPS6 had been refined over time. In addition, he gave particular evidence
leaks from the input shaft
seals which had become apparent during the period he held the SEO Manager
position. He also explained
the distinction he drew between the normal
operating characteristics of the DPS6, on the one hand, and quality concerns
on the other.
111 He thought it was important to communicate to owners of vehicles equipped
with a DPS6 what the normal operating characteristics
of the transmission were.
He gave specific evidence about information circulars which had been provided to
the Respondent’s
dealers relating to the performance of the DPS6 and he
explained the training which was given to dealers about that. He explained
US’ worldwide monitoring systems for vehicle performance and the issuing
of technical service bulletins (‘TSB’)
(which were intended to
inform the servicing activities of dealers) and field service actions (which
more related to the taking of
some proactive step by dealers).
112 The Applicant criticised Mr Karageorgiou’s evidence on a
number of bases. These were:
(a) That he gave his evidence to reflect the
Respondent’s company line;
(b) When challenged to deviate from the company line he gave responses such as
‘not specifically’, ‘not necessarily’
can’t recall’ or would proffer a response which was beneficial to
the Respondent but inconsistent with contemporaneous
records or underlying
documents; and
(c) He had been heavily prepared.
113 To make good these bases the Applicant pointed to three examples. First,
it was submitted that Mr Karageorgiou had tried to suggest
that there may
be some specific differences between the DPS6 in one car versus another before
he ‘ultimately’ agreed
that the general operation was the same.
This, however, is not what the evidence shows. The transcript references given
Applicant’s submissions are T539.43-47, T540.16-17 and T540.24-33.
From these portions of the transcript it can be seen that
Mr Karageorgiou
did not ‘ultimately’ agree that the general operation was the same.
It was in fact the first answer
he proffered. The evidence referenced by the
Applicant begins at T539.43:
The question I am asking is, in each of those
nameplates, the DPS6 transmission, in terms of its hardware and componentry, was
same, wasn’t it?---Well, it was not the same, because there mated to
different engines and they’re installed in different
applications. So,
technically, they are not the same. In essence, the principles and general
operation is the same.
114 The next relevant part of the transcript is at T540.14-26:
All right. And – okay. All right. But in terms of
the – subject to that difference, is there any difference in terms of
hardware and componentry in each of the DPS6 transmissions?---So every
transmission has specific differences. The general operation
is the same.
What are the specific differences, then, Mr Karageorgiou?---Well, your gear
ratios are one. Your – the casing and how it mounts
to the engine is
another. You know, there could – and there’s – there could be
other specific details that are
very different to a particular – to a
particular application.
All right. But in terms of the basic layout of the DPS transmission – and
by that I mean two clutches, centre plate or drive
plate in the middle, inner
input shaft outer input shaft, and the like, they are all the same;
correct?---Correct.
115 Pausing there, Mr Karageorgiou was accepting that the layout of the
transmissions was the same. The cross-examination continues
at T540.28-47:
And the whole idea was to have, in effect, a modular
unit of the same size that could be used in various applications; that’s
correct, isn’t it?---That – that is a principle that’s used in
the design; correct.
And the clutch assembly in each of the DPS6 transmissions, in terms of its
architecture, is the same; correct?---Generally. Correct.
All right. Why do you say “generally”? Why not just
“yes”?---Because every clutch– it could be –
the – the specifics of the clutch assembly will be designed to suit the
application for which it is used. The principles
of operation are the same, but
the specifics of the clutch could be different from one application to
But do you mean to convey by that there’s a different sized clutch
plate?---Well, could be that it has different sized clutch
plates. It could be
that the – you know, torsional springs inside the clutch could be
different, because it has a different
engine that it mates to.
But when you say could be, do you actually know, Mr Karageorgiou?---I – I
do not recollect the specific differences of all
the different clutches that are
used in the DPS6 applications across the Ford model range, no.
116 Mr Karageorgiou accepted that the general operation of the DPS6 was
the same in each vehicle but he thought, although he could
not be sure, that
different engine sizes might affect the size of the clutch plates and the nature
of the torsional springs. He
could not recall what those differences were but
he thought that there were some. The cross-examiner did not suggest to him that
he was wrong about this.
117 What one does not see in this evidence is the notion that
Mr Karageorgiou was ultimately driven to accept that the layout was
same. That submission can only succeed by incorrectly inverting the order in
which Mr Karageorgiou gave his evidence. Once
the correct order is applied
the submission collapses. I reject it.
118 The second example of Mr Karageorgiou’s alleged tendency
‘to pedal the company line’ was as follows and related
to the issue
of leaking from the input shaft seals. Mr Karageorgiou had agreed that the
new seals differed from the old seals and
that manufacturing new vehicles with
the new seals would not result in the new seals being put in vehicles which were
the road. He also accepted that in the case of those vehicles there
continued to be a risk of a seal leak. I accept the evidence
Mr Karageorgiou shows each of those matters. Next it was submitted that
‘when it was put to him that there was a risk of
failure in all vehicles
with the old seals, he denied it, and struggled to explain why it would not be
119 No transcript reference for this last proposition is given in the
Applicant’s submissions. This is probably because Mr
Karageorgiou
gave no such evidence. To the contrary, he accepted at T594.19-38 that the
earlier vehicles with the old seals carried
with them a risk of failure:
But – and to properly deal with the problem of the
seals – would be to bring all those vehicles that are either on the
or on the lot, bring them in and change the seals; do you agree with that?---If
every single car was going to fail, then, yes,
you would do that.
But you’ve already accepted that these seals carried with them a risk of
failure, correct?---There is a – yes, there
is a risk associated with
that, and my understanding was it was a manufacturing quality issue that caused
But there was also a problem with the properties of the seal,
correct?---I’m not aware of issues with the properties of the
All right. But the way to eliminate the risk, Mr Karageorgiou, would be to bring
in all the vehicles that had been produced prior
to the dates that you put in 27
and to change the seals, correct?---Well, if – again, if, you know, the
majority of all the
cars were going to fail, then, you know, that’s what
you would do. However, the experience that we had was this was not, you
– not every single car would fail and some cars, you know, that had
potentially been impacted during manufacturing, they
may fail, but the car was
provided with a warranty and we can support the customers in that respect.
120 The submission that Mr Karageorgiou denied that there was a risk of
failure in relation to the vehicles with the old seals cannot
be maintained in
the face of this evidence which is to the contrary. I reject the allied
submission that when confronted with that
proposition that he ‘struggled
to explain’ why the vehicles with the old seals did not have that risk.
He did not struggle
because he did not say that. It may be that what the
Applicant was in fact seeking to submit was that Mr Karageorgiou denied
due to the risk of leak from the old seals, every single individual vehicle
fitted with that seal was at risk of failure. That would
be consistent with
this question which was asked of Mr Karageorgiou at T594.40-44 immediately
following the above exchange:
Vehicles that had potentially been impacted during
manufacturing, Mr Karageorgiou, would be all of those vehicles that were
manufactured
prior to the dates that you put in paragraph 27; that’s
correct, isn’t it?---Well, I – no, because it could depend
know, what caused it, as to how many cars could be affected.
121 I remain unpersuaded by this attack on Mr Karageorgiou’s
credit even if that is what the submission was intended to be.
122 The Applicant’s final point about this was that
Mr Karageorgiou was ultimately forced to concede that he was speculating.
The actual part of the transcript is T595.1-10:
And there was obviously a reason for having those new
properties in the new seals; do you agree with that?---There would be a reason,
that’s correct.
All right. And so there would be a risk, would there not, of failure in all of
the vehicles with all of the old seals, correct?---If
those seals suffered from
that manufacturing quality issue, that’s correct. The new properties could
have been there to make
that manufacturing process more robust.
You are you are just speculate in that last answer, aren’t you, Mr
Karageorgiou?---I am speculating.
123 I agree that Mr Karageorgiou conceded that he was, in this case,
speculating. However, I do not regard this evidence as impacting
negatively on
his credit. In particular, I do not accept that his evidence was generally
speculative.
124 The third example proffered is more substantial. There is no doubt that
on or around 8 October 2013 Mr Karageorgiou received
TSB14/13. It was
expressly directed to the issue of intermittent transmission clutch shudder in
the DPS6. Mr Karageorgiou’s
evidence was that at that time, as he
understood it, the clutch shudder issue related to a leak of transmission fluid
into the bell
housing. The point of the cross-examination was to attempt to
show that TSB14/13 also disclosed that there was a shudder problem
which was not
associated with the leak of transmission fluid into the bell housing. To cut
ahead somewhat, subsequent to TSB14/13
it was determined by Ford that the
friction material the clutch plate was lined with was itself a source of clutch
shudder and that
discovery led to the replacement of those clutches which
presented with difficulties with clutches lined with a new friction material.
deal with this issue in much more detail below at Section VII. The point for
present purposes is that TSB14/13 does not refer
to this problem.
125 TSB14/13 contains a procedure to be carried out when a car with clutch
shudder presented for repair or servicing. Very shortly
it instructed the
mechanic to conduct a test of the fluctuations in the rotation rate of the inner
transmission input shaft during
acceleration from a standing start. This test
was known as the 250 rpm test which meant that it was designed to ascertain
the fluctuations in the transmission input shaft’s rate of
revolution exceeded 250 rpm. A data logger tool would record the
shudder event as the vehicle was accelerated from rest at 18-30% of the full
throttle power. The tool would then produce
a graphical representation of the
shudder, an example of which is given below:
126 The horizontal axis of this graph measures time elapsed,
notated in 2.5 second intervals. The vertical axis records the rate
of rotation
of the inner input shaft in rpm. The circled section ‘C’, which is
reproduced to its right in expanded form,
is the clutch slip phase during
take-off where the rotation rate of the input shaft is increasing to eventually
match that of the
drive plate. However during this phase of slip the rotation
rate of the input shaft oscillates relatively rapidly. The 250 rpm
looks to these oscillations and measures whether the largest height difference
between any adjacent peak (‘X’ in
the diagram) and trough
(‘Y’ in the diagram) is greater than 250 rpm.
127 The mechanic was instructed to apply the test and to examine the bell
housing for signs of any leaking transmission fluid. The
four possible results
and the step to be taken in each case were:
Test Outcome
Action to be taken
< 250 rpm without visible transmission fluid
Vehicle OK – no further action needed
> 250 rpm without visible transmission fluid
Replace dual clutch assembly
< 350 rpm with visible transmission fluid
Clean dual clutch assembly
> 350 rpm with visible transmission fluid
Replace dual clutch assembly
128 The cross-examiner’s point was that the second of these options
showed that there was an issue of clutch shudder which was
not connected with
the leakage of transmission fluid. The cross-examiner sought to have
Mr Karageorgiou accept that there was another
issue. The relevant evidence
was as follows at T592.19-593.19:
I want to suggest to you there is no other reading of
13(c) of this document that I have just taken you to other than there was an
issue with the excessive shudder in the DPS6 transmission at this time that was
unrelated to the transmission oil leak seal issue;
that is correct, isn’t
it?---That could be interpreted, correct, yes.
You’re agreeing with the proposition I just put to you, correct?---The
proposition that you are putting forward, I was not
aware of an issue separate
to the oil leak seal at that time, but based on this TSB, there was a clause
there that would capture
and address any other issues associated with the clutch
that may have not been associated with the seal leak.
But how does the mere replacement of the clutch assembly, with exactly the same
componentry that was in there before, fix the problem?
HIS HONOUR: Maybe the clutch was stuffed, Mr Pike.
MR PIKE: Can I ask the witness the question, your Honour?
HIS HONOUR: Yes.
MR PIKE: How does - - -?---That – that’s – so - - -
All right. I will ask another question. You are aware, aren’t you, Mr
Karageorgiou, that subsequently Ford diagnosed a problem
with the friction
material on these clutch faces?---I have subsequently become aware that there
was a change in the material on the
clutch assembly, yes.
Because it was found that that B80/80 material that was used at this time on the
clutch plates was causing excessive shudder, correct?---I
familiar with what the cause of that was because it happened after my time.
I want to suggest to you that the problem that was being – sorry, I will
go back to it. Just pardon me one moment, your Honour.
All right. Just dealing back on 13(c) of this document, Mr Karageorgiou, did you
know as at October 2013 what the cause was of the
excessive shudder that was
unrelated to the transmission seal issue?---I – at that point I
don’t recollect that we had
a separate issue that was not associated with
the oil seal.
But you accept, don’t you, on reading 13(c), that there was such a
separate issue?---It’s also possible that there was
something, as I said
earlier, the clutch may not meet our specification. There could be an issue with
the clutch that required –
that caused it to have shudder. There’s
lots of components within the clutch assembly, and if one of those components
then that could cause shudder. For example, you could have a torsional
spring failure, which could cause that type of situation.
So (c) was there to
address if the clutch had a problem separately.
129 There are two interpretations of the procedure described in TSB14/13 at
play. One is that where the shudder test exceeded 250
rpm but there was no
sign of leaking transmission fluid that this signified a known problem the
solution to which was to replace
the clutch assembly. The other is that this
demonstrated that there was an unknown problem with the transmission and that
the solution
was to replace the clutch assembly. The correct selection between
these two choices turns upon the terms of TSB14/13 itself. Three
important for this exercise. The first is the heading:
Subject: Intermittent Transmission Clutch Shudder
DPS6 Powershift Transmission And/Or Transmission Fluid Leak
130 This is capable of supporting the idea that the bulletin was dealing with
two distinct but sometimes overlapping problems: intermittent
clutch shudder and
transmission fluid leak. The contents of the bulletin are then described under
which is headed ‘Description’:
Some WT/WZ Fiesta and LW/LW11 Focus vehicles equipped
with a DPS6 ‘Powershift’ transmission may exhibit an intermittent
transmission clutch shudder on light acceleration from rest. Some vehicles may
or may not exhibit transmission fluid leaking from
the clutch housing. Refer to
Page 3 for TSB applicability.
In the event of a customer complaint for these conditions, please follow the
Service Procedure outlined below.
131 This too suggests that there were two issues involved and it was those
issues which the bulletin aimed to solve. Leaving out
quite a lot of the
technical detail in the bulletin and moving instead to the central instruction
at §13 what it said was this:
Inspect the dual clutch assembly for signs of fluid
contamination.
a. If the dual clutch assembly is contaminated
with transmission fluid and the RPM difference calculated in Step 8 is below 350
the dual clutch assembly may be cleaned. Proceed to Step 14.
b. If the dual clutch assembly is contaminated with
transmission fluid and the RPM difference calculated in Step 8 is 350 RPM or
the dual clutch assembly must be replaced. Proceed to step 15.
c. If the dual clutch assembly is not contaminated with any type of fluids and
the RPM difference calculated in Step 8 is 250 RPM
or above the dual clutch
assembly must be replaced. Proceed to Step 15.
132 One can test what §13(c) shows by asking oneself what would happen
to a customer whose vehicle presented with a clutch shudder,
returned an rpm
fluctuation > 250 but which did not show signs of leaking transmission
fluid. There are two possibilities. The
vehicle could be returned to the
customer with nothing done to it. In that case, presumably the intermittent
clutch shudder would
continue. The second possibility is that one might try and
fix the problem (whatever it was) by replacing the entire clutch assembly.
133 It is possible that the persons who wrote the bulletin were already aware
that there was another difficulty with the clutch lining
material and that the
‘dry’ clutch shudder, ie one not caused by fluid having leaked into
the bell housing, might result
from it. It is also possible that the authors of
the bulletin were aware that dry clutch shudder might be caused by a range of
perhaps some of them overlapping. I discuss this later on but, for
example, excess shudder might result from a constellation of
factors such as a
single mass flywheel, the driving of the vehicle in an assertive fashion, the
absence of a cooling system in the
DPS6 and the material selected to line the
clutch plate. Another possibility is that for entirely unknown reasons this
customer’s car had a damaged clutch assembly.
134 The solution in §13(c) of replacing the clutch assembly seems to me
to be the last resort solution for any sufficiently noticeable
shudder problem
which had not been solved by cleaning the clutch assembly of transmission
135 The point for present purposes is that whilst the person who wrote the
bulletin may or may not have had one or more other possible
problems in mind in
directing the execution of §13(c), I do not think that the bulletin makes
explicit what those problems (if
they were then perceived at Ford US) were. To
the extent the cross-examination was directed at seeking to win from
Mr Karageorgiou
a concession that he had been aware of some other problem,
I do not think that it succeeded. The bulletin did not say there was
known problem and is consistent with a range of possibilities in that regard.
Mr Karageorgiou himself made this point at
T593.13-19 extracted above at
[128] detailing that the shudder could have been caused by the failure of any of
the components in
the clutch other than the input shaft seal.
136 This point brings one back, of course, to the cross-examination of
Mr Karageorgiou. Mr Karageorgiou denied that he was aware
bulletin disclosed the existence of a clutch shudder problem in addition to that
caused by leaking transmission fluid.
At T585.6-8 he said this:
So what I want to suggest to you is that it was apparent
to you, on reading this TSB, if not earlier, that it wasn’t all vehicles
that exhibited the shudder that had a transmission fluid leak; that’s
correct, isn’t it?---I – I disagree.
137 And at T585.26-29 he said this:
All right. And so your evidence is that at this time
that was what you thought was the only problem; is that correct?---That’s
All right. Leading to shudder; correct?---That – that’s correct.
That was the – yes.
138 The Applicant submitted that Mr Karageorgiou had eventually accepted
that, despite his denial of being aware of a dry clutch shudder
problem after
becoming aware of the bulletin, this was in fact the only reading of the
bulletin which was open. The Applicant cited
T592.19-22 as evidence of this
confession. However, that is not what that extract of the transcript bears out
nor is it altogether
complete. The complete reference is T592.19-28 which is
extracted above at [128].
139 I read this evidence as being consistent with the interpretation of the
bulletin I have explained above. I do not think that,
having regard to the
second answer given in the transcript, Mr Karageorgiou accepted that the
bulletin showed there was another issue.
140 So far as concerns the Applicant’s submissions concerning
Mr Karageorgiou’s response to some questions as ‘not
specifically’, ‘not necessarily’ or ‘I can’t
recall’, no specific references were given in the
Applicant’s
submissions. These expressions, or expressions near to them, appear many, many
times in the transcript and, without
specific reference, I do not propose to
examine them. I will say, however, that it was not my impression of
Mr Karageorgiou that
he was seeking to evade answering the questions he was
asked. So far as the submission that Mr Karageorgiou had been heavily
is concerned, I was not taken to any evidence to that effect. Even if
I had been and it was shown that Mr Karageorgiou had spent
a lot of time
preparing before entering the witness box, it would not affect my assessment of
his credibility. I did not have the
impression that he was delivering set
speeches. Rather my impression was that he was endeavouring to answer the
questions as best
141 In those circumstances, I reject the Applicant’s attack on
Mr Karageorgiou’s credibility. He was a reliable witness.
142 Mark Cruse is
presently employed by the Respondent as the Customer Service Engineering Manager
in its International Markets Group.
He has worked for the Respondent in a
number of roles since 2002 but, relevantly for this trial, was employed as its
Service Engineering
Manager from August 2014 to January 2018, replacing Mr
Karageorgiou. His duties at that time included dealer technical support for
field service actions and managing campaigns, recalls, technical hotlines, field
service engineers, training, tools, diagnostics
and publications. He is also a
qualified motor mechanic and is qualified in, and has taught, automotive
engineering.
143 Mr Cruse made an affidavit dated 1 October 2019 which was read at
trial with some minor objections limiting the use of certain
sentences. He was
called as one of the Respondent’s witnesses on the 11th and 12th days of
the trial, Monday 29 June 2020
and Tuesday 30 June 2020. He was
examined in chief at T631, cross-examined from T632-751 and re-examined from
144 He gave evidence about the nature of the DPS6 transmission, the position
of the Respondent as part of Ford US’ Asia-Pacific
region, the process of
updating the DPS6 transmission based on field experience and its normal
operating characteristics. He also
gave evidence about difficulties with the
DPS6 which were known to the Respondent by 2016: wet clutch shudder, the TCM
solder issue
and dry clutch shudder. He explained Ford US’ global quality
monitoring process and the manner in which the Respondent was
notified of
quality concerns with Ford vehicles and the processes by which it passed that
kind of information on to its dealers.
He gave specific evidence about what he
knew about the DPS6 during his tenure as the Service Engineering Manager
commencing with
the handover period with Mr Karageorgiou in July 2014. He
explained the various technical service bulletins which had been issued
that time, the warranty extensions that had been granted and the additional
training which had been given to dealers. He
gave specific evidence about a
change in the clutch friction material which became available in Australia from
May 2016. Mr Cruse
said that by the end of 2016 he thought that the
three quality concerns with the DPS6 referred to above had been resolved.
145 I deal with the specific issues raised by Mr Cruse’s evidence later
in these reasons. However, it is convenient to deal
at this juncture with the
Applicant’s global criticisms of his evidence. The Applicant submitted
that Mr Cruse gave his evidence
Component Deficiencies at a high level of generality. She also submitted that
evidence reflected the Respondent’s ‘company line’. It
was said that he had resorted, under cross-examination,
to responses such as
‘not specifically’, ‘not necessarily’ and ‘I
can’t recall’.
146 During his cross-examination over two days, Mr Cruse did not answer any
question ‘not specifically’.
147 There were 12 occasions on which he used words to a similar effect. They
are at T635.9, T645.36, T670.43, T675.10, T682.15, T683.39,
T685.6, T696.39,
T717.10, T718.12, T720.24 and T725.31. I have examined each of those and I do
not consider that they reflect adversely
on his credit when read in context.
148 He had answered two questions ‘not necessarily’. The first
was at T695.45-696.3:
And would also lead to decreased performance of the
transmission?---Can you explain what you mean by performance in this case, Mr
Well, the fuel efficiency of it, for one?---Well, not necessarily, because it
would get into its top gear on the highway and still
operate locked up. So I
don’t know that it would hurt the fuel efficiency necessarily, Mr
149 I do not consider that this reflects adversely of Mr Cruse’s
credit. The second was at T725.4-16:
However you wish, Mr Cruse?---Yes. 1, I was aware of;
that’s the assembly plant damage on installation. And 5. I had some
that the surface finish was contributing. The others I was not aware
All right. So 5 is a design issue?---Not necessarily.
Well, it says:
Design not to Ford guidelines.
So I want to suggest to you it’s a design issue?---Okay. As suggested
there, I knew there was surface finish concerns, which
could have, in my mind,
been machining. I had not seen this, Mr Pike.
150 Although Mr Cruse accepted the cross-examiner’s position I do not
think this supports the broader contention that he was
resistant or equivocal in
his answers. Mr Cruse used the answer ‘I can’t recall’ or
‘I don’t recall’
on 23 occasions during his cross-examination.
These are at T635.9, T641.32, T642.18, T646.25, T646.30, T646.35, T646.41,
T647.45, T670.32, T670.44, T678.21, T679.31, T679.42, T696.39, T708.29,
T708.40, T717.1, T717.10, T718.12, T733.26, T740.40 and T745.24.
examined each of these. Each appears to be an example of Mr Cruse legitimately
saying that he could not recall. Given that
most of this evidence related to
events which occurred 8 years ago this is unsurprising. There was no challenge
to him on any of
these occasions to the effect that he could recall.
151 As to the ‘company line’ submission, that was not my
apprehension of his evidence if by that it is meant that he gave
contrary to the fact so as to further the position of the Respondent. No doubt,
he was sympathetic to the Respondent but
it was not my impression that he was
willing to give incorrect evidence to further its position.
152 It was also said that his responses were often inconsistent with
objective contemporaneous or underlying documents. These documents
identified and the submission, in that circumstance, is not able to be assessed
in that general form.
153 The Applicant also submitted that Mr Cruse had been heavily prepared for
his cross-examination. Under cross-examination, he said
that he had spent
‘weeks’ preparing for it: T646.44, T650.22 and T680.15. I accept
that Mr Cruse had prepared heavily
for the cross-examination. That is not a
surprising proposition where the Applicant is suing the Respondent for hundreds
of millions
of dollars and Mr Cruse is an important one of the
Respondent’s witnesses who is still employed by it. I do not think it
adversely on his credit. No doubt it means that he had had a thorough
opportunity to think through the matters in relation to which
he was challenged
but I did not obtain the impression he was reciting his evidence
programmatically or delivering speeches.
154 The Applicant submitted that Mr Cruse’s evidence should be
approached with care because it was apparent that he was often
unwilling to
concede matters until confronted with a document. Three examples were
155 The first example was that he had denied under cross-examination that he
was aware in mid-2010 that Volkswagen produced a car
which contained (as the
Affected Vehicles do) a dry dual clutch transmission and only accepted that he
must have been aware of it
by at least April 2012 when he was taken to a
document. The evidence does not bear this out. The relevant question appeared
T635.18-25:
All right. Now, you’re aware – sorry, you
were aware in sort of mid-2010 that the DPS6 was Ford’s first dry dual
clutch technology transmission?---Yes.
Were you aware
at the time
that VW and its associated brands had a dry
dual clutch transmission in service?---No, I was not.
(Emphasis added)
156 So what Mr Cruse was asked was whether he was aware in mid-2010 (ie
‘at the time’) that Volkswagen had a dry dual
clutch transmission.
He was then asked at T648.34-40 about an email he had sent on 26 April 2012
whose subject heading was ‘Re:
“TGW” for VW DSG in China/DPS6
Market Intro’:
And if you have a look again at the subject there, Mr
Cruse, do you see the subject?---Yes.
TGW or VWDSG in China/DGS6 market intro. Do you see that?---Yes, I do.
So do you accept by this time, so April 2012, you were aware of a VW dry dual
clutch transmission?---Based on the heading, yes, aware
of the existence,
157 I see no contradiction between Mr Cruse’s initial evidence that he
was not aware of the Volkswagen dry dual clutch in mid-2010
and his acceptance,
based on his email, that he was aware of it by April 2012. The
Applicant’s submission about this suggested
that he had initially denied
being aware of it in 2010 but this had changed when he was confronted with the
email. But his evidence
to him that he was aware in mid-2010 of the Volkswagen dry dual clutch
transmission. There is no basis in the evidence
which supports the contention
that Mr Cruse had given evidence about what he knew in mid-2010 and then
recanted from it when confronted
with the email. I reject the submission that
the first example reflects poorly on Mr Cruse’s credit.
158 The second example concerned an internal Ford US document dated
8 January 2012 and entitled ‘DPS6 Lessons Learned Paper
Summary of Key Issues for the DPS6 Transmission Project’. It is an
engineering document concerned with various issues
which had arisen in relation
to the DPS6 transmission by 8 January 2012. The cross-examination of Mr Cruse
sought to have him accept
that he was aware of this document by April 2012.
This was done by taking him through an email chain in April 2012 in which Mr
had referred to the Lessons Learned document. I interpolate that at this
point in the cross-examination Mr Cruse had not been shown
the Lessons Learned
document. Even so, he conceded in the face of the email chain that he was aware
of it but only as a document
relating to training at T645.16-24:
MR PIKE: All right. But I want to suggest to you you
were aware at this time of an actual document in relation to the DPS6
transmission
that was a lessons learned document?---From a training perspective,
I will say yes. For anything else, I will say no.
All right. But it’s – I’m talking about an actual document
actually headed Lessons Learned. You were aware of it,
you?---I’m not aware, based on the context. If you’re saying
training, I expect there’s something
heading Lessons Learned for training.
Anything else, I’m – I’m not aware of at this time.
159 He was then shown the Lessons Learned document at T646.9 and asked about
whether he could deny knowing of the document in April
All right. You’re not in a position to deny that
you saw it prior to April 2012; correct?---Please continue. I will try to see
I can remember something. Please continue. Again. Again. Again. Again. Once
more, please. Again. Once more. Again. Mr Pike, I
– I don’t recall
seeing that at that time. I just simply don’t recall it.
All right. But, again, you’re not able to deny that you had seen it prior
to April 2012?---I can’t deny, no.
All right?---I can’t recall seeing it either.
Have you seen it – are you meaning to convey, by the answer that
you’ve just given, that you have seen it since April
2012?---I’ve
seen it in recent weeks, as supplied by Allens, for review.
160 The multiple references to ‘again’ are Mr Cruse directing the
document operator to scroll through the document and
may be disregarded. What I
get from this exchange is that Mr Cruse probably was aware of the Lessons
Learned document in April 2012
but had no actual recollection of the matter.
161 In the Applicant’s submissions it was then said that Mr Cruse
accepted that he had been aware of the Lesson Learned document
in April 2012 and this was shown by exchanges which happened at T647
This submission does not go very far, however. Mr Cruse had, in fact, already
conceded that he must have been aware of
the document because of the email chain
at T645 extracted above but he had added the rider that he would have been aware
from a training perspective. I do not think that the transcript at
T647.42-45 and T649.27-28 cited by the Applicant supports the
contention that he
accepted that he had been aware of it in April 2012 for three
is unsound when he had
already accepted that he was aware of it.
, there might
nevertheless be second life for the contention were it to be shown that Mr Cruse
had abandoned his qualification that
he had been aware of the document only from
a training perspective but T647.42-45 simply does not establish this:
And don’t you accept, therefore, that you must
have been aware, as at April 2012, of the first document that I just showed to
you, being the USA lessons learned document?---That’s what’s being
referred to here as a USA lessons learned publication.
Other than that, I
don’t recall the document, Mr Pike.
, contrary to the Applicant’s submission at [73],
T649.27-28 does not establish that Mr Cruse ‘ultimately conceded he
been aware of it in April 2012’. What it says is this:
And so would you accept this document that is on screen
is likely to be the attachment that is referred to in your email?---Yes.
163 However, the document on the screen was an Excel spreadsheet which had
been attached to an email sent by Mr Cruse: T649.17. It
was not the Lessons
Learned document. Consequently, this evidence does not support the contention.
164 In her written submissions in reply the Applicant sought to buttress this
case by reference to the answer given by Mr Cruse at
T641.14-16:
MR PIKE: So you’re aware, aren’t you, Mr
Cruse, of something called lessons learned documents in relation to the DPS6
transmission?---I’m, at this stage, not yet sure of what you’re
referring to, Mr Pike, no.
165 This was the first question Mr Cruse was asked in this exchange. This is
not evidence that Mr Cruse was unaware of the document;
it is evidence that he
did not know what the cross-examiner was talking about. I have considered
whether the point the Applicant
was trying to make here was that Mr Cruse
perhaps was giving evidence about two different documents. One of these was
by his office and was concerned with lessons learned from a training
perspective and the other was the Ford US Lessons Learned document.
Combing the
transcript one can perhaps cobble together such a proposition (see eg,
T645.33-46) but I do not really think that was
put squarely. In any event, I do
not think it matters. Whatever the Applicant’s submission about this was,
I simply do not
think that Mr Cruse was really seeking to be evasive about it.
166 I do not accept therefore the Applicant’s submission that Mr Cruse
gave evidence about when he knew of the Lessons Learned
document from which he
ultimately resiled. His substantive evidence at the start of this section of
cross-examination (leaving aside
the first answer to which I have referred) was
that he was aware of the document from a training perspective. I do not
his evidence was any different by the end of this phase of his
cross-examination. I do not accept therefore the Applicant’s
submission at [73] that he had given inaccurate evidence at the outset of this
topic from which he had then, confronted
with documentation, resiled. That is
not what happened.
167 The third example concerned input shaft seal leaks. The
Applicant’s point was that Mr Cruse had ‘initially’
concede that he had been aware in 2014 that the seal leak was a design issue but
that he had ‘ultimately’
conceded this ‘because he had known
that the replacement seals were more robust and involved a “change to the
at T685.1-9.
168 The Applicant’s submissions did not identify where Mr Cruse had
initially refused to concede that he had been aware in 2014
that the seal leak
was a design issue. At T650.27-34 Mr Cruse agreed that he had been aware in
2013/2014 that there was an issue
with the input shaft seals and oil leaking
through them. At T650.37 he said that he had not been aware in 2013/2014 that
shaft seal leak issue was a design issue.
169 The evidence that Mr Cruse resiled from this was at T684.40-685.9:
All right. And we’re dealing here with August
2014; correct?---Yes.
And the – so do you mean to convey by those answers that you understood
then that part of the work being done in relation to
the seals was to make them
more robust; correct?---Yes. And – and bear in mind I walked into the role
and this work had been
done. So we had a TSB, we had seals that were now brown
instead of black, and – and we had our instruction out to the dealer
when I walk in to that role. Correct.
But just to be clear, you understood that the brown seals were more robust than
the black seals; correct?---Yes. Yes. Correct.
And because they were made with a different material, which obviously had
different properties; correct?---I wasn’t aware of
the materials change. I
wasn’t aware of the specifics of the robustness action.
You were at least aware, weren’t you, that they were more robust because
of a changed design?---A change to the seal, yes.
170 Whether one regards Mr Cruse as having recanted from his earlier evidence
at T650.37 that he was not aware that the input shaft
seal leak issue was a
design issue depends upon whether one reads this evidence as demonstrating an
acceptance on his part that the
switch from black seals to more robust brown
seals was a design change. I do not read his final answer as evidencing that.
his final answer as him accepting that the change to the seal had
resulted in a more robust seal. I do not read it as Mr Cruse accepting
change to the seals was a design change. I read the answer as accepting that
the new seals were more robust (‘yes’)
but because of a change in
the seal (‘a change to the seal’) rather than a ‘changed
design’. The cross-examiner’s
position was that a change in the
seal material meant that the issue with the old seals must therefore have been a
design issue.
I do not think this was Mr Cruse’s position.
171 Consequently, I do not accept that Mr Cruse resiled from his earlier
evidence and I do not accept that this evidence detracts
from his credit.
172 The Applicant then finally submitted that Mr Cruse seemed to have
prepared answers on topics of interest. There were two steps
(a) He had given long non-responsive answers to
questions relating to the topics of safety or the TCM at T693.22-33, T693.38-41;
(b) When asked a simple question about how he defined a safety issue he had said
at T703.16-17 ‘Do you want to talk about TCMs,
173 I do not think the answers in (a) were not responsive and whilst I would
accept that the first answer was long, the second was
not. The first part of
the series of questions and answers leading up to and including T693.22-33 is as
All right. But you know people in the real world
sometimes don’t always react to even months and months of warning in
to lights going on; that’s correct, isn’t it?---Yes. We
would expect that they should though, Mr Pike.
But, for example, if you’ve got a teenage son that just keeps driving a
car until maybe his father gets in the car and sees
the warning light has been
on for a number of months. That’s a real world situation, isn’t it,
Mr Cruse?---Yes, I think
both you and I experience it, by that look on your
face, Mr Pike.
I’m living it every day. But that’s all right. But it’s a real
world situation, isn’t it?---Yes. People do
ignore things, but – but
let’s walk through this one so we’re all clear. An ATIC91 chip will
take years to initially
propagate. So this car could be three or four-year old,
maybe six-year old. And then when it does begin, it will indicate to the
through drivability issues. There will be this jerkiness that we’re
talking about. And then that will go for months.
That will go for three or four
months of intermittent every now and again it’s doing this jerk to me. And
that’s what
the customer would complain of. Ultimately, if ignored, that
customer then will have trouble getting out of park. There will be lights
dash and the vehicle would be able to roll for many, many metres. If it was un
– non-powered through the transmission,
in something in the order of 500
metres, it would roll for and probably near a minute. And in that time all
steering and braking
would be still functional, Mr Pike.
174 The cross-examiner was positing the example of a wayward teenage son who
was likely to ignore the warning light on the dashboard.
The witness was saying
that both he and the cross-examiner appeared, from the look on the
cross-examiner’s face, to be suffering
from the same kind of teenage son.
The substantive answer he then gave was to the effect that even with such a
driver the nature
of the problem was such that it would eventually mean that the
car could not be driven. I do not think this was non-responsive.
It may have
been the result of some pre-examination thinking by Mr Cruse – I cannot
say – but even if it was, it does
not detract from the responsiveness of
the answer.
175 The second part was this (at T693.35-41):
All right. But if you’re, for example, going
across an intersection at the time of immediate failure, you wouldn’t be
able to put any power on to enable to you get out of the problem;
correct?---Yes. Similarly, you may not have been timetable power
problem, depending on your chances on the day. You may not have moved off, Mr
Pike. One of the more severe failure modes
here is that it won’t move away
from a stationary position. It won’t go. So you may not have been moved
into problem
in the first place.
176 This does not appear to be long or unresponsive. Dealing with (b), the
full exchange is at T703.10-25:
48. You say there that:
None of the quality issues described above have ever posed a safety issue.
Do you see that?---Yes.
How do you define a safety issue in that context, sir?---Can we break them down?
Do you want to talk about TCMs, Mr Pike, first?
I just want to get an understanding first, if I could, Mr Cruse, about what you
mean by “safety issue”, being the term
you have used in your
affidavit?---Okay. So a safety issue to me is one that is catastrophic. One that
comes with no warning. One
that renders the vehicle uncontrollable. Maybe a good
example would be a steering arm that falls off the vehicle or a steering rack
and I have no control. A brake system that catastrophically fails or maybe a
safety system like an airbag and Takata is another good
177 When this evidence was given, I did have the impression that Mr Cruse had
something to say about the TCM issue and, in the context,
I am prepared to
accept that he may have been attempting to give a prepared answer to this
question. However, at least at this juncture
the cross-examiner did not permit
him to deliver whatever he was going to say about the TCM issue.
178 I therefore reject the Applicant’s attack on Mr Cruse’s
credibility except the last one. To accept that is, however,
only to accept
that Mr Cruse had evidently thought about the TCM issue from a safety
perspective and had tried unsuccessfully to
give those views voice at that
juncture in the cross-examination. I do not accept the implicit, broader,
proposition at [75] of
the Applicant’s submissions that Mr Cruse’s
evidence should somehow be discounted because much of it had been pre-prepared.
That was not shown even allowing for the answer at T703.16-17.
179 I conclude that Mr Cruse was a reliable witness and I do not think that I
should be circumspect in the use to which his evidence
Mr Nethercote
180 Timothy Nethercote
is the current Service Engineering Manager of the Respondent. He succeeded
Mr Cruse in that role on 1 January
2018. He made an affidavit dated
26 September 2019 to which there were objections which were ruled upon. He
was called by the Respondent
on the 12th day of the trial, Tuesday 30 June
2020. He was examined in chief at T773-779 and cross-examined at T779-796.
181 Mr Nethercote holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical
engineering and an MBA. He began working for Prodrive as a test engineer
manager for Ford products in 2002 and has been employed by the Respondent since
2008. In this time he has performed a number
of roles including his current one
as the Service Engineering Manager. His evidence was largely to similar effect
to that of Mr
Karageorgiou and Mr Cruse. There were some differences.
The adoption of new input shaft seals, the change in the clutch lining material
and the resolution of the TCM solder issue had been completed on
Mr Cruse’s watch. The issue which Mr Nethercote was principally
concerned with was the resolution of a concern that dealers were over-diagnosing
clutch shudder problems in the DPS6 which was leading
to excessive rates of
clutch replacement. Mr Nethercote led a process which he said tamped down
the number of clutch replacements.
182 He also gave evidence about the extension of Ford’s warranty
programs. These were (principally):
warranty for 5 years that Ford will at its option repair, replace or adjust free
of charge any part of a car which is found
to be defective. This warranty had
been for 3 years or 100,000 km prior to 1 May 2018 but was
extended to five years with no kilometre
limit after that date.
In 2014 the
Respondent extended the warranty on the 2010-2014 model year vehicles with a
DPS6 to 5 years or 160,000 km in respect
of the input shaft seals, the
clutch and the transmission software calibration (at the time the general
warranty was only for 3 years).
In December 2016
this warranty was extended to 7 years or 160,000 km and to include model years
2015-2017. Where the vehicles had
been sold with the improved input shaft seals
this warranty was set at 5 years or 100,000 km.
In 2015 the new
car warranty’s coverage of the TCM in the DPS6 was extended to
240,000 km or 10 years for the 2010-2015 model
years. This was later
extended to include model year 2016 as well.
183 The Applicant’s main submission about Mr Nethercote’s
evidence was that as he was the last in time of the service
engineering
managers, his evidence was of even less relevance than that of Mr Cruse or
Mr Karageorgiou. The Respondent submitted
that it was ‘hard to
see’ how some of the questions Mr Nethercote was asked under
cross-examination were of ‘any
assistance to the Court’. Although
the Applicant repeated the submission she had made in relation to
Mr Karageorgiou and Mr
Cruse that Mr Nethercote was keeping to
the company line it did not appear that he was altering his testimony for that
reason although
he was obviously sympathetic to his employer.
184 I also agree that the structure of his affidavit was largely the same as
Mr Karageorgiou’s and Mr Cruse’s but I do
not think that
this implies that it was not his evidence. As for Mr Karageorgiou and Mr
Cruse, I have reviewed each occasion that
Mr Nethercote replied ‘not
specifically’, ‘not necessarily’ or ‘I can’t
recall’. In each
instance Mr Nethercote appeared to me to be honestly
unable to remember the detail he was being asked about. I accept that
Mr Nethercote
was a reliable witness.
185 Despite their submissions that Mr Nethercote’s evidence was
not centrally relevant the parties did nevertheless come to
blows in relation to
one aspect of his evidence. As I have said, Mr Nethercote was involved in
the program of seeking to reduce
the over-diagnosing of clutch shudder. This
began in 2019.
186 For completeness, it is useful to note that Mr Nethercote was
Service Engineering Manager in July 2019 when the Respondent distributed
Service Manager’s Letter on 16 July 2019 with Mr Nethercote recorded as
the author. The letter dealt with the topic of the
‘DPS6 Powershift
Transmission Diagnosis Process’. It had two elements of note for present
purposes. First, it conveyed
the information that the Respondent had found that
less than 5% of vehicles which dealers diagnosed as requiring a replacement
in fact did require this. Secondly, it cautioned that a vehicle failing
the 250 rpm test was not determinative of there being a
problem with the
clutch as shudder could be caused by other factors too. This passage was as
Please be aware that the 250RPM threshold
vibration test is not a definitive indicator that there is a problem with the
clutch. The
vibration test is a measurement of the shudder on the input shafts,
which can be caused by various different items from slipping
clutches, to other
NVH concerns. These other NVH concerns could produce a 250RPM vibration in the
recorded session file.
187 Another document which went out on the same day was entitled
‘Dealer Confidential Bulletin’. It was in the same terms
not be set out.
188 This evidence is material because it suggests that the fact that there is
a fluctuation in the rate of revolution of the input
shaft above 250 rpm
does not necessarily indicate that there is a problem with the clutch. For
example, Mr Nethercote mentioned
at §31 that worn engine mounts or
spark plugs can produce a similar effect from a driver’s perspective. The
Respondent’s
point is that once this was realised there was a significant
decline in clutch repairs and an increase in engine mount repairs.
Mr Nethercote provided some PowerPoint slides which were said to show these
two effects:
189 I take the ultimate significance of this evidence to be as tending to
prove that the fact that the warranty data shows a particular
level of clutch
replacements does not necessarily mean that the clutches were the source of the
190 Certainly, the Applicant’s advisers were exercised by these
documents which they described as ‘self-serving’.
The Applicant
submitted in writing that the Court should be sceptical about them because:
(a) The Service Manager’s letter had been written
in mid-July 2019 when this case was entering the evidence preparation stage
the slides were prepared in February 2020; and
(b) They had not been written by the persons who were actually knowledgeable
191 These two submissions are different in kind. Submission (a) is an
invitation to conclude that the documents have been written
in the terms that
they were so that they could be put before this Court to prove that failing the
250 rpm test does not equate to
a defective clutch. The Respondent pointed
out that this had not been put to Mr Nethercote. I agree. It would be
unfair to conclude
that Mr Nethercote had presided over the production of
documents which are ostensibly dealer bulletins so as to provide helpful
in this case without hearing what he had to say about that proposition.
In that circumstance, I will not entertain submission (a).
192 Submission (b) does not suffer from that vice and it may be put. I will
deal with the issues surrounding the 250 rpm test in
more detail below.
The Applicant also took issue in reply with Mr Nethercote’s
PowerPoint slides. Here the point was that
the slides had only been introduced
very late in Mr Nethercote’s examination in chief. In fact, the
tendering of the PowerPoint
slides caused something of a frisson when it
occurred: T774-777. The Applicant objected to it on the basis that she was
surprise but it transpired that at least one of the eight letters the
parties’ solicitors traded on 5 June 2020 had included
a statement by the
Respondent’s solicitors that they intended to tender the slides through
Mr Nethercote. Mr Nethercote duly
gave evidence that the slides had
been prepared in February 2020 and the slides were then received in evidence.
193 More substantive to my mind is the Applicant’s second submission
that the data which underlay the slides had not been produced.
The course I
propose to take in relation to these slides is to address the issues which arise
engineering perspective. To the
extent it is necessary I will use Mr Nethercote’s slides as
confirmatory of that engineering
conclusion (if they are confirmatory). I will
not use the slides as evidence directly pointing to one engineering answer over
194 The Applicant made two other points about Mr Nethercote’s
slides. One was that the graphs did not demonstrate causation
but at best
correlation. By the end of the trial it had become apparent that the Respondent
really did seek to use the material
to show, as Senior Counsel put it at
T1682.47ff, ‘it can’t be a coincidence ... that when the number of
clutch purchases
goes down, the number of engine mount purchases goes up’.
I accept that the Applicant is correct to submit that this, as with
statistical relationships, just shows correlation rather than causation. Of
course to say that is not to say that the material
is irrelevant but rather just
to understand its inherent limits.
195 The other matter concerned the cross-examination of Dr Greiner on
this point. It was said that Dr Greiner did not have the thesis
in Mr Nethercote’s slides put to him, ie, that in many instances, a
failed 250 rpm test was not indicative of a clutch
problem. I deal with
that issue in much more detail in Section VII.
Mr Davidson
196 Greg Davidson is,
and has been since January 2016, the Director of Sales for the Respondent. He
has held a number of roles within
the Respondent relating to marketing and, in
the period between 2009 and 2012, was the Respondent’s Marketing Strategy
Communications Manager. Between 2013 and 2015 he was the Group Marketing
Manager – Passenger Vehicles. Mr Davidson gave detailed
evidence about
the way in which the Respondent sells its cars. Ultimately, however Mr Davidson
was not called and his affidavit
of 2 October 2019 was not read.
197 In that affidavit he gave evidence at §§30-33 that data
published by RedBook on the second-hand automotive market was
used extensively
in the industry, including by the Respondent, to determine used car pricing and
residual values. The Applicant
tendered these paragraphs of his affidavit in
support of a submission (at [714](e)) that Mr Cuthbert’s evidence
of Ms Capic’s car should not be accepted because,
inter alia, it was based on an advertisement for a newer model year Focus
RedBook indicated had a higher value than Ms Capic’s car. I return to
this issue when I deal with Mr Cuthbert’s
evidence. Mr Davidson
has no relevance beyond that issue.
Dr Greiner and Mr Kuhn
198 I deal in much more
detail with the evidence of Dr Greiner and Mr Kuhn later in these
reasons. Dr Greiner is a transmission engineer.
He prepared an expert
report dated 22 November 2019 and a report in reply to Mr Kuhn’s
dated 13 March 2020. Dr Greiner holds
a diploma in mechanical
engineering from the University of Stuttgart which he obtained in 1984 together
with a PhD which he obtained
from the same university in 1990. His thesis dealt
with the topic of lubrication and cooling of oil-injected gearboxes. Since then
he has worked for a number of companies involved in the manufacture of
gearboxes: the Cincinnati Gear Company (naval gearboxes),
Daimler AG (ie
Maybach, Mercedes-Benz, Smart, Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler), LuK (a manufacturer of
clutch systems), ZF Friedrichshafen
AG (a manufacturer of automotive components)
and is now presently working for his own consultancy firm.
199 In Dr Greiner’s long and illustrious career with gearboxes he
has worked on many different kinds including, relevantly to
this case, dual
clutch transmissions of both the wet and dry variety and has worked with dual
mass flywheels and torsional damping
systems (also very relevant to this case).
Importantly, whilst working for LuK his main responsibility was completing the
development
of a clutch and actuation system for a dry dual clutch transmission.
I was very impressed with Dr Greiner as a witness and having
now scoured
his reports in some detail I am persuaded that he knows more about the problems
at hand in this case than anyone else
who has looked at it.
200 During the concurrent evidence that Dr Greiner gave with
Mr Kuhn an attack was made on Dr Greiner’s credit. The basis of
the attack was that Dr Greiner had included a table from a textbook written
by one of his former colleagues at ZF Friedrichshafen
AG. In fact, as he
explained in a short affidavit sworn 8 July 2020, he had modified the table
slightly. I saw this episode and
am entirely satisfied that Dr Greiner was
simply trying to be helpful. The Respondent further submitted that
Dr Greiner’s
answers in the concurrent evidence session were often
tangential or unresponsive. This was not my assessment. For completeness,
did not apprehend there to be any particular language difficulties with
Dr Greiner’s evidence who, to my observation, spoke
201 The Respondent criticised Dr Greiner’s evidence because he had
not inspected Ms Capic’s vehicle. Leaving aside the
debating point
that Mr Kuhn had not done so either, I see no force in this point. As I
explain elsewhere at some point in this trial
someone had to address the complex
mechanical engineering issues arising from the DPS6. To think that a quick look
under the bonnet
of Ms Capic’s vehicle would have been useful in what
is effectively a very complex engineering question concerning millions
vehicles worldwide is naïve. I reject the Respondent’s submission
that Dr Greiner was a desktop expert or that he
lived in an ivory tower in
Stuttgart. I did not find this kind of name-calling either helpful or
202 Mr Robert Kuhn was called by the Respondent and prepared an expert
report dated 20 February 2020. He holds a bachelor’s
degree in mechanical
engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a master’s
degree in automotive systems
engineering from the University of Michigan,
Dearborn. The topic of his thesis was the variability in system performance due
varying combinations of design and manufacturing inputs. He has worked on a
number of different engineering systems for a number
of different companies
including Chrysler Corporation, Algor Software, Ford Motor Company,
DaimlerChrysler and Exponent. He currently
works for JP Research, Inc. as its
managing engineer and provides consultancy services to many automotive
companies. Whilst at Exponent
he spent 6 months working as the managing
engineer at the rapid equipping force laboratory at Kandahar Airfield in
Afghanistan.
His role was to manage the development of rapid engineering
solutions for problems being experienced by the US army in the field.
concurrent evidence he described this as very satisfying work which one can well
understand.
203 My impression is that Mr Kuhn is more of a generalist than
Dr Greiner. Mr Kuhn has worked on transmissions in his career and
qualified to express views about them but my impression was that Dr Greiner
had devoted his lifetime to that particular topic.
As it happens, I do not
think this matters since Mr Kuhn’s evidence did not really contradict
Dr Greiner’s. The Respondent’s
approach to the litigation was,
as I explain later in these reasons, largely not to confront
Dr Greiner’s evidence directly
but instead to try and paint it as a
theory in search of a problem. This is not the place to deal with that debate.
However, this
is the place to record that, like Dr Greiner, I found
Mr Kuhn to be an excellent witness.
Mr Holtshausen and Ms Padmanaban
204 Mr Ronald
Holtshausen is a data analyst who was called by the Applicant. He prepared four
reports for the proceeding, dated 5
November 2019, 14 November 2019,
9 March 2020 and 7 July 2020. In effect Mr Holtshausen topped
and tailed the raw warranty and complaints
data into formats which could be used
by others. It is not entirely clear why he was required for cross-examination
but under cross-examination
he maintained his position that he had topped and
tailed the data as he had been requested to do. This was one of many idle
during the trial.
205 Ms Jeya Padmanaban, who is a statistician and president of
JP Research, Inc., prepared two reports dated 14 February 2020 and
17 June 2020. In these she topped and tailed the data differently to
Mr Holtshausen (as she had been instructed to do by the Respondent).
too confirmed under cross-examination that this is what she had been asked to do
but ventured a little more evidence about the
statistical analysis she had
undertaken. Their concurrent evidence session appeared to me a debate in search
of a topic. I deal
with some aspects of Ms Padmanaban’s evidence
later in these reasons. For present purposes, it is enough to say that both
Mr Holtshausen and Ms Padmanaban were witnesses of credit.
Ms Padmanaban was also included in one of the concurrent evidence sessions
with Dr Greiner and Mr Kuhn which was a little odd. Largely this was
to confront Dr Greiner with Ms Padmanaban’s preferred
vehicle years of exposure which I deal with below in Section VII.
Dr Greiner had not heard of this concept. Although
at certain points
Ms Padmanaban seemed to be cross-examining Dr Greiner I do not think
she was trying to be other than helpful and
Dr Greiner did not seem
especially put out by the experience. Neither was I.
Mr Marston and Mr Carter
206 The Respondent
retained a mechanical engineer, Rowan Carter to inspect Ms Capic’s vehicle
and to provide his expert opinion
on its mechanical condition. David Marston
was retained by the Applicant to inspect the vehicle both before and after Mr
inspections and also to observe Mr Carter’s testing. I
deal with the submissions made as to their credit and the use to which
respective evidence can be put in Section XI below.
Mr Vasilakis and Mr Cuthbert
207 Mr Spiro
Vasilakis and Mr Graeme Cuthbert were called by the Applicant and
Respondent respectively. These gentlemen are car valuers
who were tasked with
the valuation of Ms Capic’s vehicle. Although there was extensive
cross-examination of them none of it
dented their credit. As will be seen in
Section XV below, I do not think their evidence was especially relevant but
neither was
to blame for this. Each side criticised the credit of the witness
the other side called but I did not find any of these criticisms
persuasive.
Mr Stockton and Dr Strombom
208 The final witnesses
called were Mr Edward Stockton for the Applicant and Dr Bruce Strombom
for the Respondent. Mr Stockton produced
reports dated 17 December
2019, 8 April 2020 and 10 June 2020 and Dr Strombom produced a report
dated 10 March 2020, while a joint
report dated 18 May 2020 was also
prepared. Both of these men are economists and their evidence went to the claim
for loss and damage.
This evidence was highly technical. Although each party
sought to impugn the credit of the other’s witnesses, I found these
attempts quite unconvincing and, to be frank, not very useful in the context of
evidence of this kind. As will be seen, as the case
has fallen out the need to
consider their evidence fully has not yet arisen due to some procedural
SECTION VI: THE LEAKING INPUT SHAFT SEALS
209 The role of the two
input shaft seals has been explained above at [62(e)]. The inner input shaft
seal (‘the inner seal’)
lies between the hollow outer input shaft
and the solid inner input shaft. The outer input shaft seal (‘the outer
is located where the outer input shaft exits the gearbox. Both
seals are radial shaft seals which are seals which are used for sealing
elements. The basic challenge with rotating elements is to provide a seal
between the rotating shaft and the non-moving
bore in which that rotation
occurs. The part of the seal which abuts the rotating shaft is known as the
lip. The key idea in the
lip is that a thin layer of lubricant is squeezed
between it and the rotating shaft and that this thin layer should be maintained
by a process known as pumping. The part of the seal which abuts the bore
through which the shaft passes (ie the hole in the bell
housing through which
the rotating shaft passes for the outer seal or for the inner seal, the outer
input shaft) is known as the
outer backing. Unlike the lip it does not have to
deal with a rotating shaft because the bore does not move relative to the seal.
The outer backing is locked into the bore using an interference fit which, as I
understood it, meant that it was very slightly larger
than the bore diameter and
therefore had to be forced into place. Once in place it is kept there by static
frictional forces.
210 There is no doubt that for some vehicles the input shaft seals leaked.
The parties proceeded on the assumption that this problem
potentially affected
all models until a change in production was introduced progressively from
28 June 2013 to 1 October 2013. There
was perhaps a hint in
Dr Greiner’s evidence that the problem may have been limited to the
Focus and Fiesta models, although
in fairness this is not entirely clear. In
any event, no-one else suggested such a limitation and I proceed on the basis
three model lines, including the EcoSport, were affected.
211 Dr Greiner identified two problems with the seals, in addition to
some issues he said were a result of inadequacies in the manufacturing
assembly process of the transmission. The first concerned the adequacy of the
material from which the lip was made. The second
concerned the adequacy of the
material from which the outer backing of the inner seal was made. This view was
also expressed in
a number of Ford US’ internal documents to which Dr
Greiner referred.
Lip material
212 The inner seal was
made from an elastomer (rubber) called AEM whilst the outer seal was made from
an elastomer called ACM. Neither
was suitable for use in the DPS6 as in both
seals the lip could eventually fail and permit ingress of lubricant into the
bell housing.
213 The Respondent did not dispute that it had been necessary to replace both
the inner and outer seals to deal with the lip issues.
The AEM and ACM
materials were replaced with a new material ‘FKM’ which was deployed
in the production of new vehicles.
This occurred in the Fiesta from
30 August 2013 and in the EcoSport from 1 October 2013. In the case
of the Focus, it occurred
from 28 June 2013 for vehicles which were manufactured
in Germany and from 2 September 2013 for vehicles manufactured in
214 Dr Greiner accepted, and Mr Kuhn agreed, that the substitution of the FKM
material addressed one of the problems which the leaking
input shaft seals had
presented, viz
lip failure. Dr Greiner was critical of how long it took
to substitute the AEM and ACM elastomers with FKM but he did not deny that
was effective once introduced.
Outer backing material
Applicant’s case appears to be that the outer backing material of the
inner seal (which it will be recalled is the surface
of the seal jammed into the
bore and there held by static friction) was apt to cause the seal to pop out and
thereby to permit leaks
to occur. Dr Greiner gave evidence to this effect
and there was support for this proposition in some of the Ford US documents to
which Dr Greiner referred. Further, the sequence of events might suggest
that Ford US thought that the inner seal’s outer
backing material was a
problem. The initial outer backing of the inner seal was made from rubber but
in late 2014 Ford US introduced
in production new seals with an outer backing
made from steel rather than rubber.
216 Dr Greiner accepted during his concurrent evidence that the replacement
of the inner input shaft seals had resolved the issues
of failure due to popping
out of the seal. The replacement of the seals in production occurred, however,
in two tranches. First,
the AEM and ACM elastomers in the lips were replaced
with FKM. This had occurred across all model lines by 1 October 2013. In
2014, Ford US changed the outer backing material of the inner seal from
rubber to steel.
217 In his report in chief at §494 Dr Greiner gave evidence that the
switch from AEM and ACM to FKM ‘significantly reduced
the number of
Ford’s warranty repairs associated with leaking seals, however, it did not
eliminate them’. Dr Greiner
did not say, in terms, that the problem was
only solved once the inner seal’s outer backing was switched to steel,
this may be seen as an implication to be drawn from his evidence.
218 Dr Greiner’s evidence that the seals continued to generate warranty
claims (and hence to leak) is based on an affidavit
of an employee of Ford US,
Mr Christopher Kwasniewicz sworn on 5 September 2018 in proceedings
against Ford US in the state of Michigan.
Mr Kwasniewicz was, at the time
he swore the affidavit, the North American Power Train Quality Manager. Before
that he had been
the Systems Manager for the DPS6. At §33 of this
affidavit he said this:
We had determined that a small percentage of input shaft
seals were also “walking out” or coming out of place. Although
changing the seal material helped to fix this issue, we continued to work on a
design change to make the seals even more robust.
The design change ultimately
implemented was to make the inner input seal steel-backed, which was implemented
into production in
219 Dr Greiner also relied on a document from the US proceedings
VGS7-0021823 which was a presentation given by Getrag on their investigation
into the leaking seals. An annotation to a slide on the seal replacement data
observed ‘FKM material solved a large warranty
issue, but there is still
existing warranty left over’.
220 I conclude therefore that after the switch from AEM and ACM to FKM, a
‘small percentage of input shaft seals’ were
continuing to come out
of place. I therefore accept Dr Greiner’s evidence that the switch in
elastomer material did not fully
resolve the problem with the leaking input
shaft seals and that full resolution was only achieved in late 2014 when the
inner seal’s
outer backing material was switched from rubber to steel. I
therefore also accept that the choice of rubber rather than steel contributed
(in some manner) to the leaking of the input shaft seals.
Were the lip and outer backing problems design or manufacturing
221 There is no dispute
that the original input shaft seals posed a risk of failure. I am not sure in
that circumstance that much
is gained by assaying the precise problem with the
input shaft seals and, determining as a matter of taxonomy whether those
should be characterised as failures in manufacturing processes or
instead as failures in design. This is because the question in
the case is
whether the vehicles pose a risk of a particular set of failures and are, for
that reason, not of acceptable quality
Whether that risk proceeds
from features of the input shaft seals which have their origins in manufacturing
processes or instead
design processes (or both) is irrelevant to that question.
222 Were it necessary to express a view on this issue, I would take my guide
from the contemporaneously expressed view of the engineers
employed by Ford US
which were formulated in their lengthy and well documented efforts to identify
the cause of the leaking seals.
In a document generated within Ford US, in
conjunction with Getrag representatives, entitled ‘Consumer Driven
the authors engaged in a standard reporting method for problem
solving (‘6-Sigma’) applied to the identified problem
transmission fluid leaks in the DPS6 (FOR.712.002.8368). This document was
dated 13 August 2012. At p 7 and p 8 it suggests
that Ford US
saw the problem with the input shaft seals as having 10 causes, 5 of which it
identified as process failures and 5 of
which it identified as design failures.
It categorised the problem with the lip as being constituted by failures both of
and manufacture. It suggests that the problem of the outer backing
material of the inner seal was a design problem.
223 To read this document is to see how complex the diagnosis of the problems
was. Nothing would be gained by explaining these problems
in these reasons. I
mention this matter only for the purposes of resolving the dispute as to whether
these were design or manufacturing
problems. Dr Greiner thought the problems
were a mix of design and manufacturing problems. Mr Kuhn was of the view that
manufacturing problems. I have found this 6-Sigma report a surer
foundation for a conclusion than Mr Kuhn’s evidence.
224 As I have detailed above at Section V, the Respondent also called three
Australian witnesses who worked for it, who when asked
that the problems were all manufacturing problems. This evidence was
unpersuasive. Whilst all three men were
engineers they were not called as
experts and they gave evidence that they were not involved in Ford US’
efforts to solve the
problem of leaking input shaft seals. Instead, they were
effectively the people in charge of conducting the Respondent’s warranty
program in Australia. Since it is apparent that Ford US estimated it would
spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the problem
of the leaking input shaft
seals, it seems to me likely that these three witnesses produced by its
Australian subsidiary were probably
not the people within the group who were
most knowledgeable about what the problem with the seals was. On the other
hand, the documents
to which I have referred seem to have been written by senior
Ford US engineers who were very familiar with those problems. I see
reason in that circumstance to prefer the evidence of the peripheral witnesses
employed by the Respondent to what is contained
in the 6-Sigma report.
What problems could leaking input shaft seals give rise
225 Where the seals
failed it was common ground between the parties that this could cause lubricant
to come into contact with the
clutch lining. This would alter the frictional
profile of the clutch lining in unpredictable ways and cause a range of problems
which made it more and more difficult for the TCM to keep control of the
transmission. These problems, which were all intermittent,
difficulties with gear selection, sudden deceleration, jerking, grinding noises
and the appearance of the check engine light.
Dr Greiner also thought they
could extend to intermittent revving of the engine, slower response times, loss
of power and roll back
whilst in gear. There could also be rattling noises,
shudder both on launch and during gear shifts and sudden or delayed gear shifts.
I accept this evidence.
What was the risk of the seals failing?
226 For Fiestas
manufactured from 30 August 2013, EcoSports from 1 October 2013 and Focuses from
either 28 June 2013 (Germany) or
2 September 2013 (Thailand) the risk of failure
was reduced to the ‘small percentage’ referred to in Mr
Kwasniewicz’s
affidavit at §33. This followed the switching of the
AEM and ACM elastomer to FKM at those times. The residual but smaller
finally eliminated in late 2014 when the outer backing material of the inner
seal was changed to steel. After that I am
satisfied that the input shaft seals
no longer posed a risk of failure.
227 There are therefore two risks to be assessed: (a) the risk posed prior to
the switch in elastomers; and, (b) the risk after the
switch in elastomers but
prior to the change from rubber to steel in the inner seal’s outer
228 As to (a): in a document titled ‘DPS6 Evidence Book’ dated 22
November 2013 (VGS7-180958), Ford US and Getrag projected
that the seals in
question would fail at a rate of 36% during a warranty period of 5 years/60,000
miles. This evidence was not challenged
by the Respondent. The projected
failure rate of 36% within 5 years/60,000 miles was based on the Ford US seal
replacement data
for the 2012 model year DPS6 vehicles sold in North America.
The DPS6 Evidence Book includes the derivation of this projection and
the use of the 2012 model year vehicles as ‘the most refined set of
data’ available to map the failure rate
(_0971). The data in the evidence
book (_0972) shows a significant rate of failure across models and geographical
regions for vehicles
fitted with the input shaft seals in question. There is no
evidence to suggest that the seals fitted to the vehicles sold in Australia
failed at a dramatically different rate to those fitted to vehicles sold
overseas and the Respondent made no attempt to sustain such
a contention (and,
in fact, Ford US assumed that all of the seals fitted in DPS6 vehicles would
fail at the same rate globally).
229 The apparent purpose of modelling the seal failure rate globally was to
allow Ford US to estimate the total cost it would incur
undertaking replacements
in vehicles under warranty. This estimation is itemised at _0987 and by
employing the global 5 year/60,000
miles failure rate of 36%, comes to a total
figure of USD475 million.
230 From this evidence I infer that there was a substantial failure rate for
the original input shaft seals. It is unnecessary to
come to a conclusion about
an exact figure, but the evidence from Ford US shows that it was well in excess
of 20% over the first
5 years of a vehicle’s life.
231 As to (b), I am unable to come to a conclusion. Mr Kwasniewicz
said that a small percentage was involved. However, to my mind this could
mean 0.001% or 5%. A Ford US document dated 7 March 2014
that in the approximately 6 months following the implementation in production of
the switch in elastomers, only 0.02% of
vehicles were presenting seal leakage.
However I was taken to no information about how these vehicles, with the new
elastomer material
but the old rubber backing on the inner seal, fared beyond
these first few months of their life. Without some more information I
able to make a meaningful estimate of the risk involved. I find that the
Applicant has not proved what the risk posed by
the use of rubber rather than
steel for the inner seal’s outer backing was beyond that it was a
‘small percentage’.
Therefore the Applicant has not proved that a
real risk of failure existed for seals with the new elastomers but original
Fix on fail: vehicles which were repaired
232 Vehicles produced
after the switch in elastomers therefore do not have faulty input shaft seals.
What of the vehicles produced
before then? The Respondent adopted a ‘fix
on fail’ approach to the input shaft seals. Where vehicles presented with
problems with the transmission the Respondent gradually replaced the input shaft
seals and cleaned the clutch assembly. In every
case where the input shaft
seals were replaced with seals with both the FKM elastomer and a steel backing
on the inner seal, I conclude
that the repair was effective to resolve the
issue. In the case of these vehicles, they were put into the market with inner
shaft seals which had a real risk of failure. For vehicles that were
replaced with seals containing the new elastomer but old rubber
backing, there
remained a risk, the extent of which has not been substantiated. However, in
all cases where the input shaft seals
have been replaced by the Respondent since
the introduction of the steel backing, I conclude that the risk arising from the
difficulty no longer exists.
Fix on fail: vehicles which have not been repaired
233 In the case of
vehicles which have not had their input shaft seals replaced (along with those
which received a replacement with
the new elastomer material, but the old rubber
backing), the situation is unclear. The reasons why these vehicles have not had
input shaft seals replaced under the extended warranties granted by the
Respondent could be multiple:
The vehicles may
be driven by owners whose driving habits make it less likely that the seals
fail. For example, Dr Greiner thought
that the problems with the seals were
exacerbated by the heat at which the transmission operated. I return to that
issue later at
[534] to conclude that Dr Greiner is right about this. In any
event, the operating temperature range of the DPS6 will be lower in
which are driven sedately or in circumstances where gear shifts are less
Some vehicles
may be driven by owners who have not noticed the problems or do not care about
failure rate appears to have been about 36% over 5 years, this implies that 64%
do not fail over the same period (assuming
the figure has discounted repeat
failures). Although one cannot be precise about this, it implies that some of
the input shaft seals
have not failed yet or may never fail.
234 These observations are plausible as lines of thought but they are no more
than that. Thus whilst I think it is plausible that
the failure rate of the
remaining cohort of vehicles which have not had their input shaft seals replaced
may be materially lower
than the original 36% failure rate across all vehicles
because most of the failures are already likely to have occurred, I do not
there is an evidentiary basis on which I may reason in that manner.
Accordingly, I propose to proceed on the basis that the
failure rate for this
cohort is approximately the same as it was when they first entered the market,
that is to say, a real risk.
Other problems
235 Dr Greiner also gave
evidence that the input shaft seals were made more likely to fail by reason of
other difficulties with the
DPS6 that he identified. For example, he thought
that heat had its role to play in the failure as did the extent of damping of
vibrations. As I explain later in these reasons, it is likely that
the characteristics of the DPS6, both in terms of torsional vibrations
had some impact on the failure of the input shaft seals. However, whatever
those effects were, the replacement of AEM
and ACM with FKM and the switch to a
steel outer backing for the inner seal means they are no longer material.
Insofar as the input
shaft seals have not been replaced, the issue is surplusage
since I have accepted that those vehicles were supplied with a real risk
failure. That that risk of failure may have some additional causes beyond the
use of AEM and ACM and a rubber outer backing material
does not matter.
Safety issue
236 I did not apprehend
the Applicant to submit that the input shaft seals issue was a safety risk.
237 It is next necessary to turn to the issue relating to the clutch lining
SECTION VII: THE CLUTCH LINING AND ASSEMBLY
238 Two issues are
concerned here. The major one concerns the material from which the clutch
lining was made. There is a lesser
issue concerned with the way the clutches
were assembled.
Clutch lining material: B8080
239 Most of the Affected
Vehicles were manufactured with a clutch lining known as B8080. It was used in
the following vehicles:
(1) All Focus vehicles sold in Australia. There are
42,498 of these vehicles which constitute 57.9% of the entire cohort of 73,451
Affected Vehicles;
(2) All Fiestas sold in Australia manufactured before 7 January 2015.
However, ‘all’ requires two qualifications. First,
1.0L ‘Fox’ Fiesta was never manufactured with B8080 but
instead with RCF1o so the 1.0L ‘Fox’ Fiesta is
not amongst those
vehicles affected. Secondly, the 1.6L Fiesta was not offered in Australia after
the conclusion of the 2013 production
year. The 1.6L Fiestas in which B8080 was
used are therefore limited to those produced prior to the end of the 2013
production year.
In all, 20,734 Fiestas were produced with B8080, representing
28.2% of the Affected Vehicles;
(3) All EcoSports sold in Australia manufactured before
3 September 2016. There are 5,578 of these vehicles which represent
of the Affected Vehicles.
240 In relation to this somewhat complex group (93.7% of the Affected
Vehicles) it had originally been proposed that the clutch lining
would be made
from another material, RCF1o. However, before the commencement of production of
the DPS6 by Getrag at its plant in
Irapuato (in Mexico), this was changed to
B8080. It is not now in dispute that the selection of B8080 for the DPS6 gave
241 In particular, the Respondent agreed that it presented a risk of a
phenomenon known as ‘negative damping’ which would
be experienced by
the driver as a shuddering sensation. Negative damping occurs when a vibration
or oscillation is not damped but
instead reinforced (the increasing arc of a
child being pushed on a swing is an example of negative damping). In the DPS6
damping could lead to a condition in the transmission known as
‘self-excited shudder’. This shudder was noticeable to
of the vehicle. This problem is a result of the frictional properties of B8080.
242 The Applicant submitted on the basis of Dr Greiner’s evidence
that there were three other problems with B8080: (a) it had
unpredictable
frictional variability; (b) it had a high propensity to undergo ‘green
shudder’; and, (c) there were variations
in the B8080 material between
various production batches which exacerbated the frictional unpredictability of
the material. Mr Kuhn
did not take issue with this. By way of further
explanation: the consequences of unpredictable frictional variability (problem
is that the TCM experiences difficulty in predicting how the clutch plate
will behave as it is introduced to the drive plate. This
confusion within the
TCM manifests itself as difficulty in changing gears. Here useful comparison
may be made with the situation
confronting a person who has never driven a
manual car when trying to use the clutch or, where a person used to one manual
to drive another with a quite different clutch. The concept of
‘green shudder’ (problem (b)) was described by Dr Greiner
resulting from a clutch that has not yet been ‘broken-in’. In such
a clutch the friction material still has an uneven
surface which may cause
fluctuations. The problem of variation between batches (problem (c)) was
described by Dr Greiner as resulting
from Ford US not having set
sufficient production specifications or ‘tolerances’ for the B8080
material which he thought
could have enabled inconsistent batches of the B8080
material to be manufactured. Mr Kuhn did not agree with this observing
since B8080 had not been used in the field it would not have been possible
to set the appropriate tolerances. It is not necessary
to resolve this
243 In any event, I accept that each of these problems existed. They are
corroborated by engineering documents produced by Ford US
and set out at
[336] of the Applicant’s closing submissions. I did not apprehend the
Respondent to dispute these matters although
in its submissions it only referred
to the problem of self-excited shudder. However, this really does not matter.
The Respondent
accepts that the B8080 material gave rise to a problem with the
performance of the DPS6 which it regarded as sufficient to justify
replacing it
with different clutch lining materials. I return to those other materials and
the process of replacement shortly.
In the meantime, it is necessary to say
something of the separate assembly problem.
Clutch assembly problem: geometric misalignment in
244 In addition to the
problem with the B8080 material the Applicant alleged that shudder also arose
from the way in which the clutch
components had themselves been manufactured and
assembled. Here the problem was that sometimes the clutch components were
geometrically
misaligned in production. This is a different problem to the
selection of the B8080 material itself although it is related to it
in the sense
that the thing which could be misaligned was a clutch plate surface made from
B8080. Dr Greiner described the problem
by saying that geometric
variations in rotating components (such as a clutch) can cause the force at the
clutch interface to become
unevenly distributed on the drive and clutch plates.
This problem could result in torque fluctuations at the input shaft which in
turn could cause ‘forced-excited shudder’. This is because the
geometric variations can result in multiple overlapping
forces each of which can
force excitement at the clutch interface resulting in shudder. This is a
different kind of shudder to that
which resulted from negative damping (ie
self-excited shudder) which flowed from the B8080 material itself. From the
perspective
of the driver, however, they do not manifest in materially different
symptoms even if the underlying pathologies are quite different
engineering perspective.
245 In fact, it is likely that there were two problems at work here. One
concerned geometric variations in the clutch components
themselves but the other
concerned the way in which the clutches were actually assembled during the
production process. Ford US’
root cause analysis of the problem,
which was referred to by Mr Kuhn at §181, identified these twin
aspects of the geometric
variation issue. Further, as Mr Kuhn explained at
§154 and §182 the twin problems were eventually addressed by the
introduction
of tighter quality control measures which consisted of ‘end
of line sorting of clutch assemblies’. This involved testing
clutches at the end of the production line to identify those suffering from the
246 I conclude that there were two problems: geometric variations in the
clutch components themselves (the B8080 lining being one
such component) and
geometric variation resulting from the way in which the clutch system was
assembled. Both could result in forced-excited
247 I should say that this particular problem did not receive a lot of
attention at the trial and tended to be subsumed in the
und Drang of the problems arising purely from the use of the
B8080 material. However, I am satisfied that it was pleaded at
§6AB(a)(vii),
advanced by Dr Greiner in his evidence and accepted by
Mr Kuhn in his evidence in the sense that he did not contradict it.
Design or manufacturing problems?
248 Dealing then first
with the problems arising purely from the use of the B8080 material, there was a
debate between the parties
as to whether the difficulty was a design deficiency.
Mr Kuhn thought that the problem was not a design problem because, as I
already mentioned, there had been no specified tolerance for the damping
factor when the DPS6 went into production. He did not think
deficiency in the development process because field experience with the B8080
material did not exist at that time.
249 Again, I do not see why this issue matters. Regardless of how the
problem with the B8080 material is to be characterised, the
fact is that it was
a problem. Whether it was a design problem or some other problem for which
Ford US might not be seen as responsible
in the sense of making a mistake,
does not intersect with the legal issues in this case. Whether Ford US
could have known that the
B8080 material would give rise to this problem since
there was no specified desired damping factor and an absence of field experience
with it is a red herring. Whilst I can understand Mr Kuhn’s point
that it may perhaps be difficult to blame Ford US for the
problem when no
damping factor had been specified and there was no field data (I reach no view
on that question), that appears to
be a point which exists in a different domain
of discourse. The specification of B8080 for the clutch lining material appears
be a question of design – it is difficult to see what else it is.
250 Turning then to the problems arising from geometric variations, as I have
said, this was really two problems. Both were manufacturing
problems so far as
I can see. That some clutches made with B8080 contained geometric variations is
a matter which derives from the
manner in which they were manufactured. This is
borne out by the fact that not all of the clutches manufactured suffered from
problem. The situation is clearer still in those cases where the geometric
variations arose from the way the clutches were assembled.
What problems could the B8080 clutch lining material and the
difficulties with geometric variation give rise to?
251 Dr Greiner
thought that the use of B8080 material was apt to give rise to a propensity for
vehicles to experience self-excited
shudder, harsh and jerky gear shifts, a lack
or loss of power, noise, vibration and harshness issues, a degree of clutch
green shudder: §388-389. The documents produced by Ford US
suggested that the B8080 material had a propensity to cause green
shudder and
self-excited shudder. Dr Greiner and Ford US both thought that the
geometric misalignments in production could cause
forced-excited shudder as
well. I accept all of this evidence.
Resolution of the problems in production
252 The problem arising
from geometric variations was resolved on an interim basis (ie before the
introduction of new clutch lining
material) by the introduction of tighter
quality control measures including the process of testing the clutches at the
production line to detect the problem. Both Dr Greiner and
Mr Kuhn agreed that this resolved the problem of forced-excited shudder.
These tighter quality control measures were introduced in July 2013 and
resolved the problem of forced-excited shudder in vehicles
manufactured after
253 The solution to the problems posed by the frictional qualities of the
B8080 material was multifaceted depending on the model line.
254 In relation to the
Fiesta vehicles the situation is somewhat complex. From January 2015 the
Respondent says that the 1.5L Fiesta
was manufactured with a new material called
RCF1o. It does not make any submission about the position of the 1.6L Fiesta.
The evidence
the Respondent relies upon to make good this point is Mr Kuhn
at §155 who consistently therewith does not refer to the 1.6L
the other hand, the Applicant submits that the RCF1o material was introduced
into all Fiestas from 7 January 2015 apart
from the 1.0L Fox Fiesta which,
as I have already noted, was never manufactured with B8080. ‘Every other
kind of Fiesta’
(to use the Applicant’s phrase) is another way of
saying the 1.5L and 1.6L Fiestas. As I have already explained, however,
1.6L Fiesta was not sold in Australia after the end of the 2013 production year.
It follows that it was no longer being sold
in Australia at the time RCF1o was
introduced into the production process. Necessarily, therefore, all 1.6L Fiesta
vehicles sold
in Australia were sold with the B8080 material. The full position
therefore is: none of the 1.0L Fox Fiesta vehicles ever had the
clutch lining, all of the 1.6L Fiesta vehicles sold in Australia did have
the B8080 clutch lining and the 1.5L Fiesta vehicles
manufactured prior to
7 January 2015 used the B8080 material whilst those manufactured after then
contained RCF1o.
255 The Respondent says
that from September 2016 the B8080 material was replaced in production with a
half-hybrid clutch made from
B8040 on one clutch plate face and B8080 on the
other three clutch plate faces (recalling the fact noted above at [60] that
are four clutch plate faces, one on each side of both clutch plates).
256 Dr Greiner says that the switch was from B8080 to a half-hybrid
clutch consisting of B8080 on clutch 2 and a combination of B8080
and B8040 on
clutch 1. It is unclear to me whether this implies that the material on the
drive plate face on clutch 1 was made from
one material (B8080) whilst the
material on the clutch plate face contacting that drive plate face was made from
the other (B8040),
or the other way around; or that either of these combinations
occurred instead on the pressure plate side, or instead that both faces
drive plate side of clutch 1 were made from B8040 while those on the pressure
plate side of clutch 1 were made from B8080,
or the other way around again; or,
finally, whether the material on any or all of the friction surfaces in clutch 1
was actually
a blend of B8080 and B8040. The parties did not attempt to explain
what they meant. The better view is that the evidence from Ford’s
internal documents supports the implication that it was both surfaces on the
drive plate side of clutch 1 that were B8040 while both
the pressure plate
and the clutch plate surface on the other side of clutch 1 were B8080.
257 Dr Greiner further opined that Ford US had adopted this
position because (a) it had detected that over 95% of its warranty spend
clutch replacements was incurred in relation to clutch 1; and, (b) the use of
B8040 material on clutch 2 degraded performance.
This opinion was based on root
cause analysis conducted by Ford US. That analysis suggested that
switching clutch 1 to a hybrid
B8040/B8080 clutch did not improve but also did
not worsen the problem with green shudder. It also suggested that, in the
half-hybrid
clutch, ‘long term damping is positive – mitigating the
main issue with 8080 high time in service judder’: Greiner
I did not apprehend Mr Kuhn to take issue with this.
258 Dr Greiner was agnostic about whether Ford’s analysis was correct,
noting that he had been unable independently to verify
the analysis by reference
to the underlying testing data. He further noted that, while he does have
experience working with RCF1o
and believes that the shift to that material would
have provided increased damping, he does not have experience with B8040 or a
half-hybrid
clutch and therefore was not prepared to draw a definitive
conclusion. In any event, I accept Dr Greiner’s evidence that the
in production involved keeping B8080 on clutch 2 and introducing a
combination of B8080 and B8040 on clutch 1 and infer that,
while this did not
resolve green shudder it did not worsen it either. I deal with the
effectiveness of the production fixes in more
detail below.
259 Insofar as the Focus
vehicles were concerned, no production change was introduced. However, from
September 2015 the Focus vehicles
no longer included the DPS6. I therefore
conclude that all Focus vehicles sold in Australia were manufactured using the
B8080 material
until September 2015 when the DPS6 was no longer used.
How effective were the fixes in production?
260 There is no debate
that the introduction of the tighter quality control measures I have described
resolved the problem of forced-excited
shudder resulting from the two geometric
variation issues I have described. This was implemented in all three model
lines (Fiesta,
Focus and EcoSport).
261 There was then a debate as to the efficacy of the switch in production in
the Fiestas from B8080 to RCF1o and the switch in the
EcoSports to the
half-hybrid B8040/B8080. The issue does not arise with the Focus vehicles
because the switch was never made in
production consequent upon a larger
decision to stop using the DPS6 altogether in those vehicles.
262 The Applicant submitted that the switch to RCF1o (in the Fiesta) and to
the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch (in the EcoSport) had
not completely resolved
the problems initially posed by B8080. She relied on three items of evidence to
make good this point:
(1) Dr Greiner’s evidence at §415 that
the new friction material was a dramatic improvement but not a complete fix;
(2) A 6 Panel report dated 21 August 2013 (a Ford US root cause
analysis) which was said to show that both RCF1o and B8080 had a
towards self-excited shudder and that this was supported by another Ford US
analysis produced in 2017; and
(3) Mr Kuhn’s evidence which was said to show that even after the
change in material the replacement rate for clutches was
above accepted
benchmarks.
263 On the other hand, the Respondent submitted that the switch in materials
had been an effective fix. The Respondent relied upon
three items of evidence
to make good this contention:
(1) Mr Kuhn’s evidence that the switch had
been effective;
(2) Dr Greiner’s evidence, in his reply report and in oral testimony, that
the switch had been an effective measure for addressing
dry shudder; and
(3) Warranty data which showed a significant reduction in warranty claim rates
after the switch was made.
264 I do not accept that Dr Greiner said at §415 that the new
friction material was a dramatic improvement but not a complete
fix. That is
not what he says at §415. I accept the Respondent’s submission that
Mr Kuhn said at §3 of his report,
in an introductory section couched
at a very high level of generality, that the issues presented by, inter alia,
the use of B8080
had been adequately and effectively addressed. He did not say
this but I infer from the balance of the report that he was referring
switch to RCF1o in the Fiesta and to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch in the
EcoSport. I also accept the Respondent’s
submission that Dr Greiner
said at §255 of his reply report that the switches to those materials
‘appear to have been
successful’. Dr Greiner gave oral
evidence slightly at variance with this at T1154.30-34 where he said that he
thought that
the change in the friction materials had not been a ‘100 per
cent fix’ but that it had made ‘a big difference’.
Subsequently, at T1249.27-28 he said that he thought that the switch to RCF1o in
the Fiesta had been a ‘really very effective
measure for addressing dry
shudder’. This statement did not, however, extend to the half-hybrid
B8040/B8080 clutch (in the
EcoSport) and, indeed, Dr Greiner made no
comments specifically directed to the efficacy of the half-hybrid.
265 Dr Greiner’s reticence about the half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch is explained, I think, by his evidence at §415 that
experience in working with a half-hybrid clutch or, indeed, B8040 itself. While
Dr Greiner briefly adverted to warranty
data which seemed to suggest that
the switch to B8040 in replacement clutches for Focus vehicles in North America
lowered the rate
of clutch repairs, he ultimately did not draw any conclusion
himself about the efficacy of the half-hybrid clutch. In any event,
entirely clear to me that the graph extracted by Dr Greiner at §415 in
fact refers to vehicles which have been fitted
with replacement half-hybrid
clutches or, if it does, what it in fact reveals about them. I return to this
graph later in the context
of clutch replacements for vehicles on the road.
266 I conclude that the evidence of Dr Greiner and Mr Kuhn supports
the proposition that the switch to RCF1o in the Fiesta was effective.
I accept that Mr Kuhn made a general statement supportive of the efficacy
of all of the fixes applied by Ford US this did
not in terms refer to the
half-hybrid clutch and he did not in the body of his report address the issue of
its efficacy from an engineering
perspective at all. He did give evidence,
based on warranty data, about the efficacy of RCF1o but his report did not touch
the efficacy of the B8040/B8080 material other than by the general
reference in his introductory remarks. I do not think I should
act upon that
evidence as being evidence about the B8040/B8080 material from an engineering
perspective when he gave no specific
consideration to that issue in the body of
his report. Consequently, the position is that neither Dr Greiner nor
Mr Kuhn really
had anything to say from an engineering perspective about
the efficacy of the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch.
267 Turning then to the 6 Panel report prepared by Ford US and dated 21
August 2013, this document appears to be concerned with the
Focus vehicles. As
I have said, the switch in production of friction materials did not occur for
Focus vehicles sold in Australia,
however, it did occur in Focus vehicles sold
in North America. This document is therefore a problem solving method addressed
the switch in materials in a different model line (the Focus) to the ones
presently under consideration (the Fiesta and the EcoSport).
explained above, the Focus is larger than the Fiesta but similar in size to the
EcoSport. The part of the document relied
upon by the Applicant to make good
this point is at p 22. It is useful to set it out:
268 The graph certainly refers to RCF1o but it does not at first blush appear
to refer to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch. The
Applicant submitted,
however, that the reference to ‘B80X2” was a reference to B8040.
However, the graph does not refer
to ‘B80X2’ but instead to
‘8080X2’ and ‘8080X1’. In any event, the Applicant
submitted that
B80X2 should be taken as a reference to B8040 because of a
document apparently produced by an entity called Schaeffler entitled
Damping Characteristics’ and dated 24 June 2014. I pause to
note that this is not a Ford US document (although it appears
to have been
produced by Ford US in the
proceeding, defined in Section XVI
below). The Applicant relied upon a page of this document which was unnumbered
(although was
annotated VGS5-00264327 at 4342 in the electronic Court Book).
This page contains a photograph of some gears beneath which appear
B8080 Development Improvements = B80X1 (B8038) and B80X2
269 Having reviewed the whole of this document, I accept that its authors in
2014 intended to refer to B8040 with the notation B80X2.
I am also prepared to
accept that in the Ford US 6 Panel Report the reference to 8080X2 should be
taken as a reference to the B8040
material. References to 8080X2 can be found,
from time to time, in some of the documents produced by Ford US. However,
I do not think that this really assists the Applicant. The graph which
appears at p 22 and is extracted above is a comparison of
the negative damping
characteristics of four materials: B8080, B8040, B8038 and RCF1o. At the time
that this document was prepared
(21 August 2013) the use of B8040 in a
half-hybrid clutch had not been implemented and indeed, would not be implemented
until 23 October 2015 when it was implemented in North America. The
fact that a completely different material, B8038, is analysed
suggests that this
document was part of the problem solving exercise as indeed does the title of
the document itself. As will be
seen later, in some of the documents produced
by Ford US I am prepared to accept that a reference to B8040 is in fact a
to the implementation of B8040 in a half-hybrid clutch, however, I am
not prepared to do so in the case of this document. This is
because I am not
satisfied that at this stage the idea of using a half-hybrid clutch had yet
crystallised within Ford US as a solution.
I therefore conclude that the graph
at p 22 is what it appears to be, that is to say, an analysis of the negative
damping characteristics
of four different clutch lining materials.
270 Consequently, what the graph shows is that (a) negative damping occurs
where the chatter factor >0; (b) B8080 exhibits this
50% of the time; (c)
B8038 30% of the time; (d) B8040 20% of the time; and, (e) RCF1o 5% of the time.
I do not read it as saying
anything about the performance of B8040 in one side
of clutch 1 in a half-hybrid DPS6 transmission.
271 This suggests that the Fiesta vehicles which were switched in production
to RCF1o may exhibit negative damping 5% of the time.
So far as the EcoSport is
concerned the position is more complex. There was no switch in materials on
clutch 2 but the problem
which existed on clutch 2 seems to have been quite
small (to be clear, the Applicant did not run a case independently based on
2). There was a switch to B8040 on part of clutch 1 but, as I have said,
I am not satisfied that the evidence says anything about
its tendencies towards
negative damping. I am not prepared to act on either of these matters (ie a 5%
chance of self-excited shudder
arising from RCF1o or the use of B8040 in the
half-hybrid clutches).
272 Accordingly, I do not accept the Applicant’s submission that this
document shows that the switch to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch did not
resolve the issue of negative damping (and therefore self-excited shudder). I
should say that Dr Greiner referred
to the graph at §174 of his reply
report. However, he did not advance the proposition that the switch to the
half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch did not resolve the shudder problem, a contention
which appears first to have emerged in the Applicant’s closing written
submissions.
273 The Applicant also relied on another Ford US problem analysis
(‘the 14D Report’). This document is not dated but
appears to have
been produced around October 2016. This analysis is addressed to all three
model lines and is concerned with the
DPS6 generally and the problem of shudder.
The Applicant relied upon this quotation from p 3 of this document:
Testing performed by the supplier verified that the new
clutch materials
failure modes associated with the prior
material (see attachment 5.1 - judder test for clutch excitation over time in
RCF1o Clutch Material: Warranty analysis at
for Fiesta indicates
2.64 R/1000 level
post-containment vs. 29.76 R/1000 pre-containment.
B8040 Clutch Material: Warranty analysis at
for Focus indicates
0.37 R/1000 level
post-containment vs. 3.45 R/1000 pre-containment.
(Emphasis per the Applicant’s submissions)
274 The Applicant submitted that this showed that the switch in materials
(which one may comfortably infer was intended to cover both
the switch to RCF1o
and to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch) had ‘reduced’ failure
modes ‘but self-evidently
not eliminated them’. The
Applicant’s submission, however, omitted reference to the attachment with
which this section
was accompanied. That attachment was entitled
‘Attachment 5pt1.pdf’. This attachment dealt separately with RCF1o
B8040. So far as B8040 was concerned it appears to show that the new
material did not exhibit negative damping other than when the
clutch was very
new and even then only at very low levels. For RCF1o it indicates that it
experiences no negative damping at all.
Read in that light, I do not read
‘reduced’ in the body of the report in the way the Applicant
suggests. The attachment
suggests that the problem would be eliminated for
clutches with RCF1o but is inconclusive as to the effect of introducing B8040
one side of an otherwise fully B8080 dual clutch transmission.
275 I do not accept therefore that this document shows that the switch in
production to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch was not
Consequently, I do not accept that the two documents relied upon by the
Applicant demonstrate that the switch to RCF1o
or the half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch was not effective.
276 That leaves the warranty data. Both sides relied upon this data to
support their contentions about the efficacy of the switch
in production to
RCF1o and the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch. The Applicant submitted that a
graph prepared by Mr Kuhn (his Figure
26) and part of the 14D Report
from Ford US showed that the fixes had not been effective. The Respondent
submitted that graphs prepared
by Ms Padmanaban (Figure 6 and Figure 7 in
her second report) showed that they had.
The Applicant’s contentions
277 Figure 26 in
Mr Kuhn’s report is as follows:
278 She submitted that this showed that for Fiesta vehicles produced after
January 2015, the clutch replacement rate was comfortably
in excess of the
benchmark of 3RE/1000 by 24 MIS and was travelling close to 10RE/1000 for the
2016 vehicles by about 24-30 MIS.
This submission involves a number of concepts
which need to be explained before the submission is assessed.
279 The notation 3RE/1000 is a shorthand for 3 repair events per 1000
vehicles. The rate thus expressed is somewhat amorphous since
it does not say
anything about the vehicles it applies to (presumably they do not include those
still standing on the showroom floor).
To be meaningful it needs to be tied to
a third variable which can frame the rate. For example, one might usefully say
were 3 clutch replacements per 1000 vehicles that had been in service
for a year or, alternatively, that had been driven at least
30,000 kms. The raw
statement that there are 3 clutch replacements per 1000 vehicles is, therefore,
arguably meaningless. No doubt
for this reason, transmission engineers
sometimes add an additional dimension to this metric known as months in service
Thus 1RE/1000 at 18 MIS means that for every 1,000
vehicles which have been in service for 18 months there has been 1 clutch
replacement.
280 Next, the benchmark referred to in the Applicant’s submission is a
reference to a document entitled ‘System Design
Specifications’.
The SDS is an Excel spreadsheet with a number of tabs. One of these is entitled
‘Document History’.
It sets out the history of the document and
suggests that it was initially created on 15 March 2006 and thereafter updated
times until 24 July 2009. Another tab headed ‘DPS6 Powershift
Transmission – System Design Specification’ suggests
document sets out the specifications required by Ford US’
Transmission and Driveline Engineering division. That raises
the question of
specifications for whom? Since it was Getrag and LuK who made the transmission
I infer that this document represents
the specifications provided by
Ford US to Getrag (or LuK) for the DPS6. Pausing there, the DPS6 was put
in three different model
lines involved in the present litigation. It would be
surprising given the range of engine and chassis sizes of the vehicles that
performance specifications for the DPS6 for each model line would be the same.
281 The Applicant’s submissions at [357] and [360] referred to a number
of elements of the SDS. The first was cells 27, 28
and 33 of the tab in the SDS
entitled ‘NVH’. ‘NVH’ is an acronym for ‘noise,
vibration and harshness’.
The only point of these references appears to
be that they contain a cross-reference to another tab entitled ‘B299N
Targets’. There is also another tab entitled ‘C Car
Specific Targets’. B299 is a reference to Fiesta vehicles
usually identified by an alphanumeric code starting with B (recalling that the
Fiesta is a B-segment vehicle). For example,
as Annexure 5 to
Dr Greiner’s report shows, the Fiesta vehicles amongst the Affected
Vehicles were all known as B299A. I infer
that the tab entitled ‘B299N
Specific Targets’ sets out the specific targets applicable to all types of
Fiesta and that
the N is, in effect, a variable which can reflect any of the
codes for the various versions of the Fiesta. As such the ‘B299N
Targets’ tab is not relevant to the EcoSport (B515A) or the Focus (C346A
and C346E). Since the present discussion
does not concern the Focus the tab
dealing with C-segment car specific targets may be put to one side.
282 Moving then to the tab entitled ‘B299N specific targets’ one
enters the fray knowing one is not talking about the
EcoSport but only the
Fiesta. The Applicant identified row 69 as the focus of her attention. It
specifies that the rate of repair
per 1000 is to be 3.2 for the B299N vehicles
(ie the Fiesta). It does not say anything about MIS periods. It also
identifies that
the rate of replacement for the ‘commodity target’
is 3. Doing the best that one can, I infer that the commodity target
other vehicle actual or imagined against which the B299N is to be compared,
perhaps a competitor’s vehicle.
283 Returning then to the Applicant’s submission at [360], it contains
two elements. One is a submission about what Mr Kuhn’s
shows. The second concerns a comparison between what the figure is said to show
and the suggested benchmark of 3/1000
by 24 MIS. I deal with Figure 26
shortly but the comparison submission must fail. The benchmark rate identified
by the Applicant
in her submissions is a benchmark of 3.2 not 3 and is not,
contrary to the Applicant’s submission, expressed by reference to
The transposition error of 3.2 to 3 is probably not especially material (and,
indeed, seems not to have been made at [357]
of the Applicant’s
submissions or at [69] of her reply submissions) but the reference to 24 MIS
which I cannot locate in the
SDS makes the submission difficult to assess. In
her reply submissions, the Applicant says that she
‘SDS ... uses the industry interval of by 24 MIS’ because that is
the interval which Dr Greiner regarded as
‘typical’ ([40(a)]).
I do not think it is safe, absent direct evidence about the benchmark adopted by
Ford US in the
SDS, to draw such an inference. Moreover, despite the
Applicant’s assertion at [40(a)] of her reply submissions that the
Respondent’s
‘criticism that the R/1000 benchmark might require some
other interval was something the Respondent needed to prove by evidence’,
it is the Applicant who advanced the argument that the warranty data bespeaks
the inefficacy of the switches in clutch lining material.
In that context, the
warranty data’s opacity stands in the way of her argument being accepted.
That said, I do accept that
the portion relied upon by the Applicant in the SDS
is concerned with the Fiesta vehicles. However, it is not concerned with the
EcoSport (where the switch was to the half-hybrid clutch).
284 Turning then to Figure 26 itself, on its face it is concerned with the
Fiesta not the EcoSport so, like the SDS itself, it is
of no probative value in
relation to the EcoSport. So far as I can see it does not say anything about
what the suggested benchmark
should be at all. Indeed, I cannot help but think
that [360] of the Applicant’s submissions has in some way miscarried. I
am unable in that circumstance to assess the Applicant’s submission about
it because that submission does not make sense.
The explanation proffered at
[40(a)] of the Applicant’s reply submissions, referred to above, does not
improve the position.
285 Addressing myself to Figure 26 unencumbered by the Applicant’s
submission about it, I do not think that it shows that the
switch to RCF1o in
the Fiesta in January 2015 did not resolve the problem. There is, so it
seems to me, a missing metric in Figure
26. Taking, for example, the 2014
production year it tells one that 24.3% of the 1.5L vehicles for that production
year have had
a clutch replacement. Does Figure 26 mean that 24.3% of 1.5L
Fiesta vehicles had had at least 1 clutch replacement by November 2019?
mention that date because that is when the warranty data that Mr Kuhn was
briefed with concludes, and his comments on the seemingly
Figure 27 at §239 of his report suggest this interpretation. It is
not clear to me however that this is the case.
286 These problems make Figure 26 difficult to grasp. No doubt, some rate
dropped from 24.3% to 2.2% between the 2014 and 2015 production
years but I do
not really know what that rate is. Doing the best that one can, I proceed on
the basis that the Applicant’s
point is that even after the introduction
of RCF1o in production from January 2015 the rate (whatever it is) was still at
The inference underlying this submission is that all elements of the
non-zero clutch replacement rate after January 2015 are to be
attributed to
problems with the performance of RCF1o. But I do not see why I should draw that
inference. Presumably there is a
background failure rate for clutches which has
got nothing to do with the inherent properties of their friction material and
turns upon real-life matters such as how vehicles are driven and
maintained. In a given population of vehicles, some are going to
be driven in
harsh conditions and treated disrespectfully (Dr Greiner referred to this as
‘spirited driving’). Is that
what the 2.2% reflects? Or does only
part of the 2.2% reflect that problem? On that view, would the part which was
left be significant?
Or does some other problem lurk behind the figure?
287 Given these insuperable difficulties, I do not think that this kind of
evidence shows anything about the efficacy of RCF1o in
the absence of some
engineering evidence that there was, in fact, a problem with RCF1o. If there is
such engineering evidence then
it is a much surer foundation for this kind of
finding than this kind of evidence. If there is no such engineering evidence
I do not think that this kind of evidence can be used to summon a case from
thin air. I therefore do not accept the Applicant’s
submission that
Figure 26 shows that the switch to RCF1o was not effective.
288 To prove the switch to RCF1o was effective, the Respondent chose to rely
on Ms Padmanaban’s evidence to which I will come.
To the extent the
Respondent relied on Figure 26 by extracting the seemingly identical
Figure 27 in a later section of its submissions,
I would have found it
unpersuasive for the same reasons I find the Applicant’s submission about
Figure 26 unpersuasive. Further,
there are aspects of Figure 26 which are apt
to mislead. To the extent that it is being advanced as showing the switch to
was effective, it is puzzling to me why the 1.0L Fox Fiesta has been
included in the graph since it never used B8080 in the first
place. The same
may be said about the inclusion of the 1.6L Fiesta which also never had the
switch to RCF1o in Australia. The only
vehicle in which the switch occurred in
Australia is the 1.5L Fiesta.
289 So Figure 26 does not help the Applicant. She also relied on the 14D
Report to which I have referred. This submission was at
[361]. It refers to
the ‘250 rpm test’ which I have explained in more detail above at
[125]-[127]. Ford dealers in
Australia were instructed to apply the test to
vehicles presenting with clutch issues. In effect the test was applied to see
a vehicle exhibited shudder. Dealers were instructed not to replace a clutch
if no shudder was exhibited. There was a debate between
the parties as to
whether this was an appropriate test with the Applicant submitting that the
Respondent in selecting the rate was
motivated by cost considerations rather
than a desire accurately to detect the true extent of deficiencies experienced
by customers.
I address that debate in more detail below, in the section
dealing with on-road fixes. The implication of that in the current context
that it might mean that the rate of clutch replacements was artificially
depressed because of the way the test was designed.
Given my view that there is
not much assistance for either party in the warranty data this, if accepted, is
merely another reason
for staying away from it. However, that was not what the
Applicant submitted. Instead, she submitted that the 14D Report had
acknowledged
that vehicles with a fluctuation in the rotation rate of the
transmission’s input shaft below 250 rpm can still have shudder.
no need to set out this portion of the 14D Report. Assuming in the
Applicant’s favour that the warranty data understates
the extent of the
shudder problem, this would not assist in advancing a case that the RCF1o fix
had not been effective. On this
hypothesis, this would only show that Figure 26
in Mr Kuhn’s report – whatever it means – understates the
As I have said, I do not think I can do much with the 2.2% referred to
in Figure 26 in terms of assessing whether RCF1o works.
If one adds into
this conceptual quagmire that the 2.2% figure may be understated because of the
limitations of the 250 rpm test
I do not see that that problem gets any better.
Understated, of course, covers a range of sins. Was it a little bit
understated?
Should it have been 4%? Without knowing a bit more about that the
same difficulty to which I have already referred still exists,
that is to say,
what is causing this failure rate? The Applicant took as her point of departure
that the residual failure rate was
caused by the RCF1o material whilst the
Respondent (at least in relying on Ms Padmanaban) took as its point of
departure that the
low level of the residual failure rate showed RCF1o had
resolved the issue. In fact, both sides imported into the data their own
of how the case ought be decided and tended to ignore the other side’s
point. The Respondent only saw the drop in the
clutch replacement rate on the
introduction of RCF1o and ignored the residual failure rate that remained. The
Applicant focused
only on the residual rate and ignored the drop which had
occurred. For my part, I do not find this evidence at all helpful.
290 In those circumstances, I do not accept that Figure 26 shows that the
RCF1o material was not an adequate fix (or, for completeness,
that it was). The
picture is not improved even if one accepts that the 250 rpm test led to
under-diagnosis.
291 The Applicant’s submissions about Figure 26 do not appear to have
been directed at the EcoSport which did not involve a
switch to RCF1o but
instead to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch. In any event, Figure 26 is not
The Respondent’s submissions
292 The Respondent
submitted that the effectiveness of both fixes (RCF1o and B8040/B8080) was
demonstrated by the warranty data for
both the Fiesta and EcoSport vehicles.
The Respondent relied on the evidence of a statistician, Ms Padmanaban, who
subjected the
warranty data to further analysis and processing.
293 The Respondent’s submission that the fixes had been effective was
based on Figure 6 and Figure 7 in Ms Padmanaban’s
second report.
Figure 6 is about the EcoSport (ie the B8040/B8080 switch) and Figure 7 is about
the Fiesta (the RCF1o switch). The
figures are as follows:
294 Figure 6 and Figure 7 require a lot of explanation in order to make
sense of them. The explanation begins with Ms Padmanaban’s
the metric ‘VY’. She explained that she had analysed the data to
determine the rate of warranty claims against
the number of years of vehicle
exposure. Ms Padmanaban referred to this metric as ‘vehicle years
(VY) of exposure’.
For example, a vehicle which has been on the road for
1 year has a VY of 1 year. Using the VY metric she was able to determine
there were 25,123 Fiesta vehicles on the road (this is at variance with the
finding above that there were 25,119 such vehicles
but this may be put to one
side) which had between them 165,846 vehicle years. As with Mr Holtshausen, the
data analysed by Ms Padmanaban
concluded at 26 November 2019.
295 I do not find these graphs at all useful. They suffer from the same
problem as Figure 26 in Mr Kuhn’s report. What Figure
7 shows for
the Fiesta vehicles is that after the introduction of the RCF1o material a rate
which had been between 15-30 warranty
claims per 100 vehicle years dropped to a
rate of less than 10. Because the use of the blocks has obscured what the
actual rates
were for each production month one does not really know what the
actual drop was other than it could have been as little as a 33%
drop from 15
(the minimum in the previous block) to 10 (the maximum in the post January 2015
block) or at least as large as a 66%
drop from 30 (the maximum in the preceding
block) to 10 and perhaps as high as 100% if the claim rate for the
January 2015 production
month was 0%. What the graph tells one therefore
is that the drop was somewhere between 33% and 100%. Why the position of
production months was removed from the graph is a mystery but I am
bound to say that presented in the form that it is I do not find
version of the graph in Annexure 4 in which the
individual production month data
was displayed, along with annotated confidence intervals. However, the parties
agreed that some
(unrelated) data had to be removed from the warranty data and
these graphs prefigure its removal. It was this change which necessitated
Ms Padmanaban’s second report. One cannot therefore do much with
Annexure 4 other than to note that production of a graph
which had the actual
position of particular production months was something which could have been
done in Figure 6 and Figure 7 of
her second report.
296 Assuming in the Respondent’s favour that I should take from Figure
7 that there was some kind of non-trivial drop in warranty
claims from January
2015 (which is about as good as it gets), I do not think this throws any light
on whether the switch to RCF1o
did, or did not, resolve the shudder problem. To
the extent that there is a residual level of claims (unknowable because of the
decision to use a block-style graph), this might tend to suggest (and the
Applicant would no doubt submit) that this showed RCF1o
was not an effective
solution. An assessment of either party’s submissions about this would
require a grasp of what the background
rate was likely to be and how the
(unknown) rate implied by Figure 7 related to that background rate. In effect,
whilst I can see
that the substitution of RCF1o improved the situation I cannot
say it resolved it. Nor, based on this data, can I say that it did
not resolve
297 In any event, I am to a degree sceptical about the decision to analyse
the position by reference to vehicle years. To understand
this scepticism it is
necessary to take a short detour and to understand what is known as the bathtub
curve. Mr Kuhn and Dr Greiner
were both familiar with the bathtub
curve. Mr Kuhn regarded it as ‘accepted in the industry’
(§111) and Dr Greiner
agreed with this at §246 and following of
his reply report. He summarised the idea this way by saying that ‘over
lifecycle of a product, the curve capturing the observed failure rate is
expected to take the shape of a bathtub’. Mr Kuhn
provided a picture
of a bathtub curve at Figure 8:
298 Dr Greiner was referring to failure rates in actual vehicles and,
unlike Figure 7 in Ms Padmanaban’s report, was not using
metric. The point for present purposes is that the warranty claim rate for new
vehicles is expected to be high but then drop
rapidly to a low rate for most of
the life of the vehicle before rising sharply as it reaches the end of its life
(in this way, cars
are like humans: mostly vulnerable in infancy and old age).
The problem with the VY metric may now be appreciated. Under it, the
claims made by a vehicle in its first year on the road are treated precisely the
same way as for a vehicle in its fifth
year on the road. To illustrate this
point imagine there are only three vehicles, A which has been on the road for 1
and C which have both been on the road for 3 years. Imagine further
that A has made 2 warranty claims in its first year and that
B and C have also
made 2 claims in their first year but none since. If this is imagined in terms
of warranty claim rates by reference
to how long each vehicle has been on the
road it conforms simplistically to the bathtub curve. That curve reflects the
reality that
for B and C no claims were made after the first year.
299 But the bathtub looks quite different through the lens of vehicle years.
Between them A, B and C have 7 years on the road and
the number of claims is 6.
The rate of claims per VY is 6/7, ie, less than one. However, in the real world
all three vehicles made
2 claims in their first year. The figure is reduced to
less than one because, in effect, the low claim rate in the later years reduces
the high initial claim rate. The effect of the VY metric on warranty claims is
to reduce the apparently high initial rate by reason
of the subsequent lower
rate. In other words, the VY metric flattens the bathtub curve.
300 When used as a metric to measure claim rates I am concerned, therefore,
that it has a depressing effect on failure rates the older
the age of the cohort
(at least until the other end of the bathtub is reached). The warranty data in
the present case cuts out at
26 November 2019. The complaints data however
extends only to 31 January 2019. In her first report Ms Padmanaban
analyses the complaints
data at §§92-100 also using the VY metric.
More complaints data was available extending up to 18 March 2020 and the
Respondent,
in the lead up to the trial, wished to use it. This matter was
first ventilated at an interlocutory hearing on 5 June 2020. The
due to start on 15 June 2020. I took the view that more data would always be
becoming available on an ongoing basis and
that at some point a line had to be
put under the evidence in the interests of an orderly trial. I therefore
concluded that no further
complaints data becoming available after 31 January
2019 should be used. It is an interesting thought, not necessary to pursue,
that later data would have brought more of the bottom of the bathtub into the VY
analysis thereby further depressing the apparent
complaint rate. Certainly, the
enthusiasm of the Respondent to include the data and the equal enthusiasm of the
Applicant to resist
it puzzled me on 5 June 2020. In any event, there is no
need to draw any conclusions about this.
301 Returning to Ms Padmanaban’s Figure 7, it seems to me that
quite apart from the use of the blocks which hide the detail
in the actual data,
the figure does not show, as the Respondent submitted, a significant reduction
in ‘warranty claim rates’.
Rather, it shows a reduction in warranty
claim rates per 100 VY which is quite a different, although not altogether
unrelated, concept.
For the reason I have just given, there is good reason to
think, in light of the bathtub curve, that situation may be more complex
this submission implies.
302 I should say for completeness that Ms Padmanaban explained that VY
accounted for the total number of years a vehicle is on the
road after it had
been purchased which seems correct. She also said that it reflected the true
exposure of the vehicle in the field.
Whilst there is no doubt a connection between the age of a vehicle in years and
its exposure
in the field this connection is by no means straightforward. For
example, four year old vehicles which have been driven in excess
of 100,000 km
per year are treated, under the VY metric, in the same way as vehicles of the
same age driven only on Sunday mornings.
There may be intuitive reasons to
think that the warranty claim rates for these two classes of vehicles may be
303 In fairness to Ms Padmanaban, she did not invent the VY metric. As
she said in her first report at §28, it is frequently
used by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety in the US and by other highway safety researchers
‘to calculate the total
number of years a vehicle is on the road’.
She gave similar evidence when briefly cross-examined about it. This statement
seems tautological to me but I accept it. Further, she also explained that the
use of the VY metric was the preferred approach for
the automotive highway
safety community when assessing the field performance of vehicles. It is not
clear to me why the automotive
highway safety community has alighted on the VY
metric but I am sure they have their reasons. In fact, it appears that
Ms Padmanaban’s
use of the VY metric may have been causally connected
in some way with the fact that the Respondent’s solicitors instructed
to use it (although I accept that she may have thought independently that it was
a useful metric). At §8(d) and §8(e)
of their letter of instruction
dated 11 February 2020 Ms Padmanaban was explicitly instructed to
produce analyses of the warranty
data expressed as rates per 100 vehicle years
and this she has certainly done.
304 What is striking about the VY metric, however, is the position of
transmission engineers who work or have worked with transmissions
on a full-time
basis. For example, Dr Greiner had never heard of the VY metric. Given
the breadth of his experience as a transmission
engineer this suggests that it
is not a metric used by transmission engineers. The same may be said of the
engineers who prepared
the root cause analyses within Ford US. The VY
metric does not appear in those analyses. This suggests that, for whatever
transmission engineers do not think the VY metric is useful regardless
of the position of the automotive highway safety community.
Mr Kuhn also
did not refer in his report to vehicle years and at §188 endorses the use
of RE/1000 to determine correlations
between corrective actions and warranty
305 I therefore do not accept the Respondent’s submission that Figure 7
shows that the RCF1o material did not exhibit problems.
Had the Applicant made
such a submission, I would also not have accepted any suggestion that it showed
that the RCF1o did exhibit
problems. Largely for the same reasons as I have
given in relation to the Applicant’s attempt to extract something useful
from Figure 26 of Mr Kuhn’s report, it seems to me that this kind of
evidence is of little use.
306 Figure 7 dealt, of course, only with the Fiesta vehicles. For the same
reasons, however, I do not accept that Figure 6 helps
either party in relation
to the EcoSport.
Conclusions on the switch in production to RCF1o and
half-hybrid B8040/B8080
307 As to RCF1o,
Dr Greiner thought it an effective solution. Mr Kuhn thought so too.
He did not, however, address it from an engineering
position and his opinion
seems largely to have been based on the warranty data (as expressed in his
Figure 26). As I have said,
I do not find either parties’ reliance on
that data in the least persuasive. Nevertheless, I propose to accept
Dr Greiner’s
evidence about it. I was impressed by Dr Greiner
and his evidence about this was against the interests of the Applicant. I
that the switch in production to RCF1o resolved the problem of dry
308 Of course Dr Greiner had said that there were other problems (such
as ‘green shudder’, described above) flowing from
the use of B8080.
Although little attention was given to this, given that those problems were
linked by him to B8080 it would appear
to follow that RCF1o did not exhibit
these problems. Certainly, I did not detect at trial any attempt to prove that
RCF1o exhibited
the other problems associated with B8080. The Applicant’s
attempt to impugn RCF1o was principally focused on the warranty
data and for
that reason mostly unpersuasive.
309 As to the switch to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch in the EcoSport,
Dr Greiner had no experience with it and expressed no
views about it. The
2013 analysis prepared by Ford US does suggest that B8040 could exhibit dry
shudder. However, as I have said,
I do not accept that this evidence says
anything about the use of B8040 in a half-hybrid clutch. I do not accept that
the warranty
claims data says anything useful on this topic. Mr Kuhn gave
evidence about it but it was expressed in his introduction at such
generality as not to be useful. Consequently, I do not accept that it has been
proven by the Applicant that the switch
to the half-hybrid clutch in production
was not effective. If it were for the Respondent to prove that the switch was
I would not accept that that was proven either.
‘Fix on fail’ strategy for vehicles on the
310 In addition to the
production fixes, Ford also implemented a strategy for addressing problems with
clutch components in vehicles
on the road. This section deals with the nature
and efficacy of the on-road fixes.
311 Ford’s strategy in respect of each component deficiency was
described as ‘fix on fail’, meaning that the defective
component was
replaced, to borrow Mr Kuhn’s phrase ‘when and if’ it
presented with problems. In the normal course,
this meant that a clutch was
only replaced following a complaint by a customer that they were experiencing a
problem symptomatic
of a defective clutch: cf Greiner §28(c); Kuhn
§234. Dr Greiner was critical of the fix on fail strategy, opining
it has left on the road many vehicles with components prone to failing
because customers are unaware of the risk of defects and that
there is a fix or
partial fix available. Mr Kuhn, for his part, described this criticism as
‘unwarranted’ and gave evidence
that fix on fail is a standard
approach in the industry for non-safety related component deficiencies:
§§234-235. Whether
or not the fix on fail approach is standard and
whether or not Dr Greiner’s criticism is warranted are questions not
to decide. What matters for present purposes is that it is in fact
the approach that Ford adopted.
312 The mere fact that a customer reported an issue which might be associated
with a defective clutch (like shudder) did not necessarily
result in the clutch
being replaced. Instead, Ford instructed its dealers and servicing engineers to
undertake a diagnostic analysis
called the 250 rpm test, to which I have
referred above. The test calculates fluctuations in the rotation rate of the
inner transmission
input shaft during acceleration from a standing start. If
the fluctuations in the transmission input shaft’s rate of revolution
exceed 250 rpm without visible fluid contamination, the clutch would
ordinarily be regarded as exhibiting (or liable to exhibit)
dry shudder and
would be replaced: see TSB13/14 (FOR.004.001.0089).
313 As I have explained, all 1.5L and 1.6L Fiestas
produced before 7 January 2015 were produced with B8080 material.
Since around
September 2016, where those vehicles underwent a clutch
replacement, the RCF1o material was installed. There was no suggestion that
use of RCF1o in a replacement clutch is any less effective than its use in
production. Accordingly, I conclude that this fix
was effective in the Fiesta
vehicles on the road to which it was applied.
314 From around September 2016, the half-hybrid
B8040/B8080 clutches were available for installation in EcoSports on the road.
I have explained, the evidence does not support a conclusion one way or the
other as to whether the use of half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch in production
solved the problems associated with the B8080 material. That applies equally to
its use in replacement clutches
for vehicles on the road.
315 In the case of the Focus, too, the half-hybrid
B8040/B8080 clutch was available for installation from around September 2016.
At §415 of his report Dr Greiner extracted a graph from a Ford US document
which appears to depict warranty data inter alia
for 2016 model year Focus
vehicles with ‘new B8040 material’ and for 2015 model
year Focus vehicles ‘with old B8080
material’. Dr Greiner
implied that, based on the data, it appears that the deployment of the
half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch
lowered the rate of clutch repairs although, as I
have said, he fell short of expressing a concluded view about this. The graph
suffers from similar problems to other representations of the warranty data
discussed above. Among other matters, it is not clear
(and Dr Greiner does not
explain) precisely which cohorts of vehicles are being represented and what has
happened to those vehicles.
Possibly, the graph is intended to show that
certain 2016 model year Focus vehicles had a clutch replacement and
received the half-hybrid
clutch and, when compared with 2015 model year Focus
vehicles (all of which, on this hypothesis, retained the B8080 material), the
upgraded vehicles were associated with a lower warranty claim rate. But this is
opaque and I decline to speculate upon it. Correspondingly,
although the
Respondent sought to demonstrate that the switch to B8040/B8080 had been
effective its submissions did not advance any
contention that the position of
the fix in relation to on-road changes to Focus vehicles should be treated any
differently to that
of the EcoSport. It therefore flows from my conclusion in
respect of the EcoSport that the efficacy of the on-road switch for Focus
vehicles has been neither proven nor disproven.
250 rpm test
316 As mentioned above,
Ford applied a clutch replacement to a vehicle on the road where the vehicle
failed the 250 rpm test. Typically,
unless the need for a clutch replacement
was otherwise indicated, it was not replaced if the vehicle did
the 250 rpm test.
317 The Applicant submitted that the 250 rpm test was not adequate and that
vehicles suffering from shudder could still pass the 250
rpm test. In my view,
this is one of many a non-issue in the case, especially when the
Applicant’s case on this issue is thought
that the vehicles were manufactured in such a way that they presented a risk of
dry shudder. In the
case of some vehicles, the Respondent remedied the problem
by changing the B8080 material to RCF1o. As I have explained, I am satisfied
that whenever this occurred it resolved the various problems which B8080 posed.
In relation to those vehicles which have not had
the replacement the
Applicant’s case remains that the vehicles are blighted by the existence
of a risk of dry shudder. If
the Applicant is correct about the existence of
that risk in vehicles which still have B8080 in them, it hardly seems to matter
the 250 rpm test is a sound test or not. In those vehicles where
the change has been made the risk has been removed. In those vehicles
has not, the risk remains.
318 The position is similar in the case of those vehicles in which B8080 was
replaced with the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch. For
the reasons I have
stated, it has not been shown that the half-hybrid clutch is defective and
therefore that the problem still exists
in vehicles on the road which have
received a half-hybrid replacement clutch. On the other hand, neither has it
been proved the
problem has been resolved in such vehicles. I return to this
topic when addressing which party bore the onus of proving that the
substitution
of B8080 with RCF1o was effective. The Applicant relies for her critique of the
250 rpm test on the evidence of Dr
Greiner which, if accepted, would establish
only that it is possible that a vehicle may exhibit shudder while returning a
test reading
of below 250 rpm not that this in fact occurred or is likely
to occur in vehicles which have been or will be fitted with a replacement
half-hybrid clutch. In other words, even if I were to accept Dr Greiner’s
critique of the design of the 250 rpm test, this
would not be sufficient to
disturb my conclusion that the efficacy of the installation of half-hybrid
B8040/B8080 clutches in vehicles
on the road has been neither proven nor
Geometric variability issue in vehicles on the
319 I explained above
that Ford sought to remedy the issue of geometric variability in production by
introducing end of line testing
and sorting procedures (to the extent the
problem was caused by the way the clutch components were manufactured or
assembled).
320 I conclude that the problem of geometric variability, to the extent it
was a problem with the way the clutch components were manufactured
or assembled
in vehicles on the road that had been produced prior to July 2013, was fixed for
those vehicles that had a clutch replacement
after this date, as these
replacement clutches had been subject to the end of line testing that eliminated
the variability problem.
The risk of problems eventuating
321 I am satisfied that
as produced all of the vehicles in the cohort which used B8080 as their clutch
lining material had a real
risk of developing dry shudder. The size of this
risk is difficult precisely to quantify. However, the 21 August 2013 6
Panel Report
suggested that 50% of clutches made from B8080 exhibited
self-excited shudder which is a lot. The final 14D Report from October
suggested that the problem of self-excited shudder further deteriorated over the
life of the clutch. This suggests that there
may be some reason to think that
the problem worsens with time.
322 On the other hand, the warranty data is not a reliable estimate since it
deals only with those vehicles where the problem actually
manifested itself.
There will be vehicles on the road where the problem is yet to eventuate or
become the subject of a complaint.
The warranty data, even if it could be used
to measure the risk, would underestimate it. This is a point Dr Greiner made at
and §187. Further, for reasons I have already given, there are
real problems with extracting precise propositions from the
warranty data for
reasons relating to the potential presence of other factors. I do however
accept that it is sufficient to say
that the problems posed by B8080 were real.
The correctness of that conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Ford US
resolve the problem in production by introducing RCF1o into the
Fiesta and the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 into the EcoSport and by its
corresponding decision to make the same switch in all three model lines in some
of the on-road vehicles which were presented for
servicing. Given the very
substantial costs involved this is not something a profit-maximising firm would
do unless there was a
real problem.
323 I conclude therefore that the use of B8080 presented a real risk of dry
shudder. It is difficult to say this in relation to the
other symptoms
described by Dr Greiner, such as green shudder. As it happens, it does not
in the end matter since if the Applicant
succeeds on dry shudder that is
sufficient for her. If she fails on dry shudder the other difficulties do not
matter either since
they are linked back to the same alleged properties of B8080
that would cause dry shudder.
324 In relation to those vehicles which never had the B8080 material because
they were produced after the change in production and
were manufactured with
RCF1o, I conclude that there is no real risk of dry shudder. I reach the same
conclusion in relation to those
vehicles which were manufactured with B8080 but
have subsequently had the clutch material changed to RCF1o. For completeness,
it remains the fact that when initially sold into the market they
carried the risk (which has subsequently been removed).
325 In relation to those vehicles manufactured with the half-hybrid
B8040/B8080 clutch, or which were manufactured with B8080 but
have subsequently
had the clutch material changed to B8040/B8080, I am unable to conclude whether
they do or do not present a real
risk of dry shudder for the reasons I have
articulated.
326 In relation to those vehicles which were manufactured with B8080 but are
yet to have the clutch lining changed to B8040/B8080
or RCF1o I conclude that
the risk of clutch shudder remains real particularly since the problem may
worsen over time. As in the
case of the input shaft seals, no submission was
developed by the Respondent that those vehicles where failure had not yet
were less likely to fail given the current age of the cohort. As I
have said elsewhere, the assessment of such a submission, had
it been made,
would require much in the way of analysis. I do not think it would be safe to
attempt such a recalibration where neither
party adverted to it.
SECTION VIII: THE TCM ISSUE
327 As mentioned already
the TCM is the computer which controls the transmission. It relies on sensors
within the transmission to
inform it of the current state of the transmission
and issues commands to mechanical actuators within the transmission to bring
gear changes and to control the two clutches. Intuitively, just as the
driver of a manual vehicle co-ordinates his or her operation
of the clutch and
gear changes with their operation of the engine and the brakes so too the TCM
has to know what is happening in
those other systems within the vehicle in order
to ensure that its operation of the transmission is coherent with those
activities.
For example, if the vehicle is slowing down to a particular speed
range via the application of the brakes this may signify that
the next gear
change will be a down shift and the TCM must act accordingly to set in train the
steps necessary to achieve that.
Consequently, the TCM must communicate with
these other systems. This involves receiving information from within the
transmission
which is accomplished via electronic sensors. It also involves
giving instructions to the mechanical actuators within the transmission
conduct the operation it has decided upon.
328 Within the transmission itself there are principally two activities to
which the TCM must attend, changing the gear on the inactive
input shaft and
when the time comes to connect that non-moving input shaft to the power,
negotiating the introduction of the relevant
clutch plate to the drive plate.
The first of these functions involves mechanical actuators within the shift
drums (these change
the gears) and the second involves mechanical actuators
which move the pressure plate, thereby pushing the clutch plate onto the
329 Each clutch is responsible either for the odd numbered gears or the even
numbered gears, clutch 1 the odd numbered gears and clutch
2 the even numbered.
These are each separately controlled, that is to say, there is a controller for
clutch 1, a controller for
the gear changes associated with clutch 1, a
controller for clutch 2 and a controller for gear changes associated with clutch
There are, therefore, four distinct control functions involved in operating
the mechanical aspects of the transmission.
330 In addition to these control functions, the TCM must also control itself
and the distribution of electrical power within it.
This is a fifth control
331 Each of the control functions is performed by a separate integrated
circuit (or chip) within the TCM. The chips which do this
are known as
‘automotive technology integrated circuits’ or ‘ATICs’.
In the DPS6 the four control functions
relating to the operation of the clutches
and gear changes are performed by four ATICs. Each of these is known as an
The fifth control function relating to power distribution on the
TCM itself is performed by a different ATIC known as an ATIC 91.
332 One observation that may be made immediately is that failure in the
ATIC 106 chips is likely to result in only localised dysfunction.
example, if the ATIC 106 controller for the gear shifts on clutch 1
completely failed then this would result only in an inability
to change gears to
an odd numbered gear. Where the ATIC 106 controlling the odd numbered
gears failed in a less than complete way,
then varying degrees of dysfunction in
gear changes with those gears might be observed. Intermittent dysfunction in an
controlling a clutch would, on the other hand, be likely to result
in symptoms associated with instability in that clutch system.
failures are localised in the particular system controlled by the relevant
333 This may be contrasted with the situation where there was failure in the
ATIC 91. In such a case, as I explain in more detail
below, the TCM goes
offline. The clutches are designed so that, absent communications from the TCM,
they mechanically place themselves
into neutral by disengaging the clutch plate
from the drive plate. This is referred to as a fail-safe mode and operates in a
fashion to a dead man’s switch. If the failure is very brief (in
the order of milliseconds) then this process will not progress
very far and the
disengagement of the clutches may not be detectable at all or perhaps only as a
brief shudder. If the failure is
longer in duration (a few seconds) then the
effect is a power loss. The full disengagement of the clutch will mean, in that
circumstance,
that the power of the engine is no longer being applied through
the drivetrain to the wheels. For that reason, the failure of the
chip leads to potentially more significant disruptions in the driving
experience. Consistently with that observation, Mr
Cruse explained that
the driveability impacts of an affected ATIC 91 chip were more significant
than those of an affected ATIC 106
334 The ATIC 91 and ATIC 106 chips were soldered to a printed
circuit board (‘PCB’) described as the lower PCB. The lower
looked like this:
335 The lower board was mounted within the TCM module which itself was then
bolted to the external surface of the transmission as
this figure shows:
336 The proximity of the TCM to the transmission housing meant that the
temperature of the latter would naturally influence that of
the former. As has
been noted in the case of the friction material, the state of kinetic friction
which occurs during the introduction
of the clutch plates to the drive plate
generates heat and this phenomenon is only likely to increase with more frequent
gear changing.
Because it is bolted to the transmission housing this heat is
shared by conduction with the TCM. The frequent fluctuations in temperature
experienced by the transmission are therefore shared with the TCM.
337 These fluctuations then bring one to the topic of the coefficient of
thermal expansion (‘CTE’). This is the rate
at which an object
expands or contracts with a given change in temperature. If two objects each
with a different CTE are bound together
then fluctuations in temperature will
cause them to expand and contract at different rates and this difference
generates a physical
force. It is this principle, for example, which underpins
the operation of a bimetallic thermostat. In the case of a thermostat
change in temperature is converted into mechanical action which turns off or on
a heating element.
338 What is good engineering in a thermostat, however, is not necessarily
good engineering in a PCB. In this case, the PCB had a
CTE of 18 (measured in
ppm/C˚) whilst the original ATIC 91 chips had a CTE of 6. The ratio
of these two coefficients was therefore
3:1 which is to say that the PCB
expanded three times as fast as the ATIC 91 chip. The evidence did not directly
disclose what the
CTE for the ATIC 106 chips was but it did suggest, in a
fairly unspecific way, that the problem was similar. Although some more
accepted that the CTE problem afflicting the
ATIC 106 was similar to that
afflicting the ATIC 91. I emphasise, however, that the evidence about this was
far from clear.
339 In any event, the effect of the differing CTEs in the case of the
ATIC 91 chips (and what I will assume was a differing CTE in
the case of
the ATIC 106 chips) was that over time the repeated heating and cooling of
the TCM created a repeated mechanical strain
on the solder which affixed the
chips to the PCB.
340 This repeated mechanical strain could cause cracks to occur in that
solder. Although it is not necessary to be precise about
this, I should mention
Dr Greiner’s evidence about this problem.
There exists a test
known as an ‘RCoT’ test (for Rapid Change of Temperature). This
test involves rapidly cycling a component
between a high temperature and a low
temperature – Dr Greiner instanced 115C˚ and -40C˚ –
so as to see how
long the component remains functional. Dr Greiner thought
that a component should generally be able to withstand 1,500 such cycles
testing. There was some evidence in Ford US’ documents which suggested
that, during the development of the TCM, solder
cracking had been observed after
750 such cycles (in the ‘Generation 1.3’ TCM) and after 1,000 cycles
(in the ‘Generation
1.5’ TCM). Whether that is actually so or what
the precise number was probably does not much matter for, as I will shortly
explain, the phenomenon of solder cracking was not in dispute.
341 What is solder cracking? Dr Greiner explained that placing the
solder under the repeated physical stress arising from temperature
fluctuations
could cause the substructure of the solder to change. As installed the solder
substructure consists of small and consistent
grains but under the mechanical
stress caused by the temperature fluctuations the grains would become larger and
inconsistently sized
and shaped. As this process of grain growth progresses it
can lead to cracks in the solder. The condition thus described is inherently
progressive. Dr Greiner seemed to imply that the temperature fluctuations
themselves would contribute to this process independently
of the mechanical
stress they generated. He did not, however, suggest that the solder cracking
process would have happened but for
the mechanical stress caused by the
temperature fluctuations. Put another way, if the CTE problem had not existed,
the temperature
fluctuations would not have caused solder cracking by
themselves.
342 A consequence of sufficient cracking is disruption in electrical
conductivity between the PCB and the chip but this may take some
time to occur.
Disruption to the conductivity of the solder leads to interference in the
communications passing to and from the
relevant ATIC. Disruptions of this kind
vary in their severity. When a degradation in the solder first occurs it may
have little
or no direct result since the crack involved may be very small and
may not yet materially disrupt the flow of electricity. As the
problem worsens,
however, there may be complete although intermittent disruptions to conductivity
which may be only of very short
duration (in the order of milliseconds). As
more cracks develop the problem deepens and the disruptions may become more
or of longer duration or both until, at last, there is a complete
343 The progressive symptoms which solder cracking can generate depends on
where it occurs. The symptomology of the failure of the
ATIC 106 chips
manifests itself in a range of problems with clutch performance and gear changes
whilst damage to the ATIC 91 chip
can generate failures resulting from
attempts of various durations to disengage the clutch caused by the fail-safe
mode. It is necessary
therefore to describe the distinct problems arising from
both. The submissions of the Applicant at [292] and the summary table of
Dr Greiner (Table 8) lumped all of the symptoms arising from the
ATIC 91 and ATIC 106 chips together under the rubric of the ‘TCM
Solder Cracks’. It is, however, necessary to examine them separately.
ATIC 91 failure symptoms
344 A Ford US 6
panel report included an assessment by Getrag of what a customer might
experience in a vehicle suffering from degenerative
cracking in the solder
affixing an ATIC 91 chip to the PCB. This document is not expressed in perfect
English so it is best to let
it speak for itself to avoid the perils of
interpretation:
Customer experience: (Symptoms For Atic91)
1. Loss of motion condition may occur while driving or stopped
2. Indication to customer:
Consistently
– PRNDL on cluster
will start flashing, “D” or other position will be blinking
be accompanied by Check Engine Light
be accompanied by various messages in cluster Message center
including: Transmission Malfunction, Transmission Overheating, Hill Assist
3. Vehicle coasts to side of road, engine remained
Braking & Steering assist still active.
4. Pedal response:
Experience 1: Neutral (open clutch)
Attempt to accelerate, engine
No Forward/No Reverse
Steering and brakes still
Experience 2: No throttle
Attempt to accelerate, engine
remains at idle.
No Forward/No Reverse
Steering and brakes are still functional.
5. Once stopped:
If engine turned off and restart is attempted
– will not crank. No Start.
Allow vehicle to sit with key off for 5 – 10 minutes, then car may
crank and start and drive normally
6. Codes Set may include:
TCM: P0607 and/or P06B8 Control Module or NVRAM
ABS/IPC: U0101 and U1013 loss of communication with TCM
PCM/IPC: P0850 Park/Neutral Switch
345 I would read point 1 as implying a loss of power of some description
which could happen whilst driving or at rest. I do not entirely
point 2 but I take from it at least that a series of lights would come on
including a flashing of the Drive gear and that
various other messages such as
the ominous ‘Check Engine’ light or ‘Hill assist not
available’ might come
on. Point 3 appears to suggest a problem similar to
point 1, namely a disengagement of the transmission leaving the car to coast
without any engine power transmitted to the wheels. Point 4 is self-explanatory
as is point 5.
346 Each of these symptoms is consistent with the point made earlier that
failure of the ATIC 91 manifests itself as attempts by the
clutches to disengage
themselves when the TCM goes offline (the consequence of the vehicle’s
neutral fail-safe mode). As I
have foreshadowed, when a power cut occurs the
mechatronic actuators in the transmission default to the open position. The
which arise from this problem depend on how long the TCM is offline.
It is easy to understand that when the TCM is offline for several
seconds then
this will be experienced by the driver as the kind of complete loss of power
which results when the vehicle puts itself
in neutral gear. When the TCM is
offline for only a matter of milliseconds then, as Dr Greiner explained,
this might be experienced
as a shudder.
347 Because the solder cracking problem is progressive rather than
instantaneous the course of symptoms is also progressive. At first,
cracking will be asymptomatic (so far as the driver is aware), then there may be
symptoms such as the shudder described by Dr
Greiner which may be followed
by very brief, but discernible, losses of driving power; finally, there may be a
loss of driving power
for a substantial period of time (in the order of many
seconds). I accept Dr Greiner’s evidence, which is consistent with
common sense, that these final stages of the problem are dangerous. If a
vehicle overtaking another suffers a three second power
loss this generates a
real risk of an accident. Other similar examples may be imagined such as
turning in front of oncoming traffic.
ATIC 106 failure symptoms
348 Dr Greiner did
not give direct evidence about what the consequences of intermittent or complete
failure of an ATIC 106 chip might
do. But Mr Cruse described the
problem in these terms:
If an ATIC 106 chip is affected, the transmission may
not always select gears appropriately or may sometimes ‘miss’ gears.
If one ATIC 106 chip loses communication altogether, the transmission will not
be able to select the gears controlled by that chip.
This could influence the
vehicle’s performance – for example, if the transmission cannot
select second gear, the running
speed may increase inappropriately high
(‘rev’) in first gear before shifting into third gear, resulting in
or shuddering sensation.
349 I accept this evidence.
The Affected Vehicles
350 The difficulty with
the soldering of the ATIC 91 and ATIC 106 chips was common to all three model
lines sold in Australia: the
Fiesta, the Focus and the EcoSport.
Risk of failure
351 I have explained the
different symptoms that could arise when the solder attaching the ATIC 91
and ATIC 106 chips to the PCB began
to crack. Since this is a case about
risks of failure, it is necessary to consider the risks of those difficulties
arising. The
position of the two chips is not the same.
352 An initial
observation is that the problems were of increasing severity and that severity
was a function of the length of time
the vehicle continued to be driven. The
shuddering problem referred to by Dr Greiner (caused by extremely short
drop outs in communication
with the ATIC 91) might be thought to be an
example of an early symptom whereas a complete loss of power for an extended
period might
be thought to be a problem which would only arise once the cracking
had developed after a considerable time. The risk of a particular
arising would therefore seem to be a function, in part, of the time the vehicle
has been driven.
353 Whilst the Applicant’s submissions did belatedly draw a distinction
between the consequences of failure in the ATIC 91 and
ATIC 106 chips
they did not observe that distinction when dealing with the extent of the risks
posed. For example, she submitted
that in March 2014 the warranty claims
rate for Fiesta and Focus vehicles had increased and that this had been noted by
The document she relied upon was a long document which Ford US may
have sent to Getrag possibly in February 2015. It begins with
a letter which is
undated and unsigned. The signature block is for Mr Alan Draper and
the recipient is the Chief Executive Officer
Mr Kotecha. The references to ‘MAM’ in the letter should be
understood as a reference to the TCM. The letter
is not an everyday letter. It
is worth setting its text out in full:

Following significant analysis into the DPS6 mechatronic actuation module (MAM)
field issues, Ford has determined that the best course
of action for affected
vehicles is to initiate a customer satisfaction action aimed at correcting all
vehicles equipped with DPS6
transmissions built since November, 2009. This
action includes a warranty extension on 2.47M DPS6 equipped vehicles along with
potential software re-flash aimed at earlier issue detection and failure mode
mitigation for all vehicles that Ford has developed.
The initiation of these actions, along with corresponding customer notification,
is pending finalization of a robust service part
supply plan. Discussion on this
plan has been ongoing and I ask for your team's continued support as we finalize
these details.
Currently we are forecasting that these actions will cost us over $579M through
the 2024 calendar year, not including our normal
warranty coverage. There is
significant technical data that demonstrates Getrag is fully responsible for
this issue based on the
robustness of the design independent of any other
Due to the significant actions and costs in dealing with this situation I would
like to immediately schedule a face to face meeting
to discuss the next steps in
terms of implementation actions as well as recovery discussions from Getrag to
Ford. Please contact
my office to arrange the meeting details.
As always, we implement such difficult actions in the best interest of our
mutual DPS6 customers. Going forward we need to jointly
execute these repairs
quickly as well as address the resulting supply and commercial issues in a
proactive and timely manner.

354 There is no doubt that, if sent, this was a shot across the bows of
Getrag. The following 647 pages contain various assessments
by Ford US of the
problem, some by Getrag and some assessments, which are difficult to follow, of
another firm which seems to have
had a hand in manufacturing the TCM,
Continental. The Applicant relies on p 5 of this document to make good her
point that the warranty
claims for the Fiestas and Focuses had increased. This
document is a PowerPoint slide prepared by Ford US and it does say that there
was increase in MAM (TCM) replacements in March 2014. It says this occurred in
B-segment and C-segment vehicles. I think therefore
that the Applicant is not
correct in limiting its application to Fiesta and Focus vehicles. The statement
applies to the B-segment
EcoSport as well, although they had only just begun to
be sold in Australia at this point in time.
355 There is a lot of detail in the 650 pages of this document but the point
for present purposes is that the topic of discussion
is the ATIC 91 chip.
Although one may fairly infer that Ford US had gone to war with Getrag over the
TCM (or was at least thinking
of doing so if the letter is only a draft) that
war seems to be a war about the ATIC 91 chip and not about the ATIC 106 chip.
one lingers for long in this document one will discover Getrag’s
efforts to put the blame at the feet of problems for which
responsible. For example, one of the lesser ones was Getrag’s contention
that the problem arose to an extent from
vibration. At p 13 Ford US expressed
its view that the vibration levels were acceptable and in any event a joint
Getrag-Ford US
team had decided that vibrations only accelerated the underlying
356 I do not need to enter the fray on that debate, rather the point is that
one needs to understand the context of this document
and its concomitant
potential strengths and weaknesses. For example, it is quite possible that the
document is Ford US putting its
most aggressive case to Getrag about why the
problem is Getrag’s problem and not Ford US’. Given the apparent
involved – USD579 million – it is wise to be astute to the
motives of its authors.
357 The principal limitation, however, is the one that I have referred to
already, namely, that substantially all of the document
is about the
ATIC 91 chip and is not about the ATIC 106 chip. I accept the
Applicant’s submission (modified to include the
EcoSport) that this
document provides evidence that the warranty claim rate had become elevated by
March 2014. To know that, however,
is not to know very much. Dr Greiner
drew the Court’s attention to a graph prepared by Ford US (and
included with the letter)
which does show a dramatic escalation in warranty
claims. This graph is as follows:
358 Dr Greiner did not attempt to link the graph to either the ATIC 91
chips or the ATIC 106 chips which was perhaps astute. The
graph appears at
p 40 of the document containing the letter extracted above and is included
amongst those documents setting out Ford
US’ position. If examined
carefully it will be seen that it suggests very widely fluctuating rates of
warranty repairs depending
on when the transmission was manufactured and whether
it was manufactured at the plant at Bari in Italy or at the plant in Irapuato
Mexico, assuming that the volume of output of these locations was relatively
similar across these model years.
359 If this is correct it would seem to suggest that the problem was in some
way related to the way in which the DPS6 was manufactured
rather than the TCM
itself. Neither party to this litigation suggested, however, that this was so.
Nor did the Respondent develop
a submission that the risk profile of
transmissions which were manufactured with the ATIC 91 chip differed depending
on their year
and place of manufacture. For example, the graph might be thought
to suggest that DPS6 transmissions made in Bari in 2012 do not
seem to have much
of a TCM problem at all. This in turn might suggest that the Applicant’s
assumption that there was a uniform
risk of failure for all vehicles was
unsound. However, such a contention was not developed and it would be
procedurally unfair for
me to consider it.
360 In the end, I am nevertheless concerned that this document might not be
entirely reliable given the agendas of Getrag and Ford
US in these
communications. Although it certainly shows an upward trend, acceptance of its
validity would imply the intra-cohort
fluctuations to which I have referred and
which do not appear to be consistent with either party’s case.
361 Dr Greiner also referred to another graph prepared by Ford US. It
is contained in a document prepared in December 2016 entitled
Update’ (Ford_DPS6-SAC_00056942). The graph is at p 5 and is
362 Of course one does not know from this graph how much of this related to
the ATIC 91 chip and how much to the ATIC 106 chip and
it likely accounts for
both. But it does suggest that by 48 months in service the rate of TCM repair
for 2012 model year vehicles
was around 13%. There were some other graphs
available, one from Mr Kuhn and two from Ms Padmanaban. Mr Kuhn’s graph
at §191 and was in these terms:
363 In fact, this is not Mr Kuhn’s graph. As will be seen, it is
actually a graph prepared by the Respondent and provided to
what was then known
as the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
(‘DIRD’) as part of the Respondent’s
efforts to persuade DIRD
to close its safety investigation into the vehicles in Australia. Be that as it
may, the real problem is
that I do not understand this graph. The line graph
appears to show the number of warranty claims for the old chips and the new
chips. The two time points in green refer to the introduction of the new
ATIC 91 and new ATIC 106 chips (more about these new chips
But the green bars seem quite inconsistent with the line graph. One reading of
the green lines is that by the time the
new ATIC 91 chip was introduced the
problem had already largely disappeared. However, neither side explored such a
submission or
its implications. On the other hand, one imagines the green line
was intended to mean something. Mr Kuhn did not explain any of
the lines but
said it showed the new chips had been effective. For its part, while the
Respondent made passing reference to this
graph in a footnote to its submissions
it did not explain what the lines really show. I have considered whether the
decline that
begins with vehicles produced from 2013 onwards is in fact just a
function of those cars not having spent sufficient time in service
to manifest
solder cracking. In this vein I note that this downwards trend as the relevant
vehicles decrease in age matches that
depicted in the graph I have extracted
immediately before this one which shows an increasing number of failures with
additional months
of service. However, since neither party explored this nuance
in the evidence I do not believe I should attempt to do so myself.
364 The Respondent also relied on two graphs prepared by Ms Padmanaban,
Figure 7 and Figure 8. I have previously set out Figure 7
[293]. Figure 8 is as follows:
365 These figures do not tell one very much about the failure rate of the
ATIC 91 or ATIC 106 chips before they were replaced, although
suggest a reduction in warranty claim rates per VY. As I have already noted, I
am concerned about the effect the VY metric
has in terms of reducing the
apparent warranty claim rate where the claim rate is initially higher but then
drops off. Without drawing
a conclusion about it, a problem of the same genus
may arise here where the claim rate is initially very low before increasing
significantly
as the vehicle ages. Because the problem caused by solder cracks
is initially non-existent but develops progressively over the life
vehicle this may imply that the effect of the VY metric is artificially to lower
the apparent rate of warranty claims. This
in turn may make the effect of the
new chips (which have spent less time on the road on average than the old chip)
appear more pronounced.
As will be seen, however, I do not need to resolve this
potential secondary effect of the metric, nor the opacity introduced by
of indiscriminate blocks spanning many production month data points. However,
it underscores my hesitation in placing much
reliance on Figure 7 and
366 Despite all of these uncertainties, I am prepared to infer that the use
of the original ATIC 91 chip did pose a real risk of failure.
The primary
reason for this is the engineering evidence which reveals the progressive nature
of the problem and its physical consequences.
It was a problem which was more
likely to occur the longer the vehicle was driven and it was a problem which got
worse not better
once it manifested itself. The problem was sufficient to
persuade Ford US to embark on a program seeking to remediate the problem
replacing the ATIC 91 chips in new vehicles and progressively replacing them
where necessary in vehicles which were already on
the road. The claim made by
Ford US against Getrag, foreshadowed in the letter extracted above, suggested
that the costs to Ford
US were in excess of half a billion US dollars. A
subsequent, and substantial, settlement was reached between Ford US, Getrag and
Continental. One may infer therefore that the description of the problem in the
theoretical terms proposed by Dr Greiner (and in
Ford US’ own documents)
corresponded with a real world problem, certainly a nine digit one.
367 The various graphs referred to do all suggest that there was a
substantial uptick in warranty claims which Ford US, at least,
seemed anxious to
put at the feet of the ATIC 91 and Getrag. Although close examination of
the graphs suggests that the picture
may be somewhat more complex, nevertheless,
it is fair to say that the evidence all points in the direction of the problems
the ATIC 91 chips being reasonably widespread. Indeed, it is clear that
Ford US (and the Respondent) were aware of a large number
of negative
customer experiences arising from the ATIC 91. They would not have devoted
the resources they did to the problem were
it otherwise. For completeness, I
did not understand Mr Cruse to be saying at T691-693 and T731-732 that the
problem posed by the
solder cracking had not resulted in a significant number of
negative customer experiences so I do not need to assess the Applicant’s
submission that I should not accept his evidence to that effect.
368 Consequently, I find that there was a real risk of the solder cracking on
the original ATIC 91 chip. Where this risk eventuated,
it would cause, in
turn, the series of steadily worsening symptoms to which I have already
referred. Whether the most serious of
those symptoms – complete loss of
motive power for several seconds – would occur depended on how long the
vehicle continued
to be driven once the initial less serious symptoms were
manifest. Those symptoms included, as noted above, shudders and brief power
drops as well as various warning messages lighting up on the dashboard such as
flashing of the ‘D’ symbol on the gear
selector. It will be
necessary to return to this topic when assessing the Applicant’s
submission that the ATIC 91 posed a
safety risk.
369 I am unable to make
a similar finding about the ATIC 106 chips. There is no material which
allows me to assess the existence
of any independent risk that they posed. As I
have said, the Applicant made no submissions about the existence of a risk of
arising from the ATIC 106 chips. The best that can be said is that
there was a sufficient problem for Ford US to think it profit
maximising to
replace the chips in production and, eventually, for some vehicles on the road.
However, I do not think that is sufficient
for me to make any sensible
assessment of the risk it posed independent of the ATIC 91 chip. The evidence
is consistent with the
ATIC 106 problem being regarded as minor but with
Ford US deciding that since it was going to have to change the entire TCM it
as well take the opportunity to fix a somewhat smaller problem. The
situation of the ATIC 106 chips was, in a real sense, overshadowed
of the ATIC 91 chips and this had the consequence that it is not possible
to make a finding about it. No doubt, there is
a more detailed story to be told
would be inappropriate
for me to try and guess about it.
Engineering solutions
370 The engineering
solution to the problem had several features. The primary solution was to
introduce revised ATIC 91 and ATIC
106 chips. The solutions in relation to
each were not, however, the same. The initial ATIC 91 chips had been made by
Texas Instruments
and, as I have noted, had a CTE of 6. Ford US (or Getrag)
then arranged for the supply of a new ATIC 91 chip by STMicroelectronics
which had a CTE of 12 thereby reducing the ratio of the CTE of the PCB to that
of the chip to 18:12 or 1.5:1 (down from 3:1). This
resulted in the solder
being exposed to less mechanical strain.
371 So far as the ATIC 106 chips were concerned, while the new chips
were also produced by STMicroelectronics with a CTE closer to
that of the PCB, a
different design was also adopted. The original ATIC 106 chips had been of
a ‘QFN package design’.
Some older people will have a mental image
of chips as having small pins extruding from them by which they are soldered to
A QFN design is different. In a QFN design the pins do not extrude
from the chip and are mere flat metallic sections on the surface
of one side of
the chip. The side on which those metallic surfaces are embedded is then
soldered to the PCB. The advantage of a
QFN design is that the chip takes up
less vertical space for it is not raised on its pins. One consequence of the
use of a QFN design
is that the solder must absorb any mechanical stress arising
from differences in the CTE of the chip and PCB.
372 The new ATIC 106 did not utilise a QFN design. Instead it was
equipped with external extruding pins which were themselves soldered
which was known as a ‘QFP design’. Dr Greiner illustrated the
difference between the two kinds of chips this
373 This figure was originally provided by the
Respondent to DIRD in Australia as part of an effort on its part to persuade
the problems with the TCM had been rectified. Dr Greiner
explained that this solution meant that the mechanical stress arising from
remaining difference in the CTE between the chip and the PCB was able to be
shared between the solder joint and the pin itself.
374 Although Dr Greiner did not suggest this, it is possible that the revised
ATIC 91 chip also used a QFP design. There are some
stray references in the
evidence which hint that this might have been so but it was not an issue which
was examined closely by any
of the witnesses. Nothing turns upon it.
375 Both Dr Greiner and Mr Kuhn accepted that these two solutions were
effective to prevent solder cracking from occurring. It is
therefore not
necessary to assess the Respondent’s reliance upon
Ms Padmanaban’s evidence to make good that proposition.
For reasons
I have already given, however, I have some concerns about Figure 7 and
Introduction of solutions in production
376 The new ATIC 91
chips were introduced into the production process at various times. They were
installed in Fiesta vehicles produced
from 23 June 2014 if produced at
one of the plants in Rayong, Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand) but for all other
Fiesta vehicles
and all Focus and EcoSport vehicles from
10 November 2014.
377 The new ATIC 106 chips were installed in new vehicles over a range
of dates between 9 February 2015 and 20 September 2016 in
with the following table:

378 The Applicant submitted that the ‘TCM Solder Crack
deficiency’ was only resolved once the second round of changes
ATIC 106 were completed. No doubt this is literally true. However, in
circumstances where I am unable to assess the existence
of an independent risk
posed by the ATIC 106 chips, I am unable to say whether there was a risk in
those vehicles which had the new
ATIC 91 chips installed but which continued to
contain the old ATIC 106 chips. I am prepared to assume there was some
desirability
of having the new ATIC 106 chips otherwise Ford US would not
have bothered changing the chip. However, there is simply no way to
existence of any risk of failure where a vehicle had a new ATIC 91 chip but old
ATIC 106 chips. Since the Applicant bears
the onus of proof on establishing the
risk, I find that the risk has not been proven.
379 There was evidence that from around October 2015 an update for the
software in the DPS6 called ‘15B22’ was available
which could detect
solder cracking before any symptoms became apparent to the driver. When the
problem was detected, a series of
warning lights would light up, upshifts in
gears would be delayed and fifth and sixth gears disabled altogether. In
practical terms,
this would compel the driver to take the vehicle in for
servicing. The evidence did not disclose, however, whether this software
was included in vehicles in production. It is perhaps natural to think that it
was but I do not think that sufficient to
make a finding about it. As will be
seen, this probably does not matter.
Introduction of solutions into vehicles already on the
380 From 27 October
2015 vehicles which presented for service had their software updated in the
manner I have just described. The
Respondent told DIRD during a presentation on
22 March 2017 that by 17 March 2017 81% of vehicles had had their
software updated.
From 22 April 2016 the Respondent had written to all
those owners of vehicles who had not yet had the update presumably to tell
DIRD on 14 September 2017 that the installation
rate was at that point 86%.
It follows, and I find, that the update had been installed in 86% of vehicles in
the period between 27
October 2015 when it was rolled out and
17 March 2017 as stated in the presentation. I have no reason to
doubt the correctness of
these statements and I did not apprehend the Applicant
to submit that the presentation was not correct especially since it relied
the same document to establish key dates: [313]. The Applicant also did not
dispute the accuracy of the 86% figure that DIRD
recorded as receiving from the
Respondent on 14 September 2017.
381 I conclude that once the 15B22 software update was installed it would
have detected any solder cracking before it manifested in
symptoms perceptible
to the driver and would have caused the vehicle to be brought in for a service
in a very short period of time
and without exception.
382 I reach this conclusion on the basis that the parties agreed this was how
15B22 operated and both Mr Cruse and Mr Kuhn gave evidence
effect, which was accepted by Dr Greiner. A similar explanation of 15B22
was also provided to DIRD during its 2017 inquires
which it also accepted. For
completeness I note that the evidence Ms Capic gave of her experience on
3 February 2016 (discussed
above at [92]) may suggest otherwise, as there
is no mention of her receiving the warning messages prior to what seems to have
a total (or near-total) loss of motive power. This is despite the fact
that her car received the 15B22 update on 16 November 2015,
as is explained
in more detail in Section XI below. However this argument was not advanced
by the Applicant. Even if it had been,
Ms Capic’s evidence on this
point is susceptible to other interpretations which the Respondent may have
chosen to advance.
It is not necessary for me to wade into this myself, indeed
it would be speculative and inappropriate for me to do so where the
not taken at trial. I therefore conclude in accordance with what the Applicant
accepted, that the 15B22 software update
would trigger alerts where solder
cracking had begun, prior to the onset of any symptoms perceptible to the
383 Having concluded that the ATIC 106 chips are not shown to exhibit a
real risk of failure the matter reduces to the position of
the ATIC 91 chips.
In relation to the cohort of vehicles which were sold in Australia with the
original ATIC 91 chips it seems to
me, for the reasons I have already given,
that they continue to pose a real risk of failure. As in other parts of the
case, no attempt
was made to run a case that the risk of failure was likely to
have dropped on the basis that all those vehicles which were going
to fail had
already done so.
384 It is important to note that by relying on the installation of 15B22 to
respond to this risk of failure, the Respondent was not
seeking to address the
underlying engineering cause of the solder cracking (ie a mismatch of CTEs
between the ATIC 91 chip and the
PCB). Instead the fix is one which relies
upon the likelihood that a human driver will respond to the warning messages
by the software and bring the vehicle in for servicing before the real
risk manifested so as to produce symptoms perceptible to the
driver. In that
sense, while I have concluded that 15B22 would almost without fail compel a
driver to do so, if the fix is to be
effective it is also necessary that there
be replacement TCMs with the revised ATIC 91 chips available for the
vehicle once it is
brought in for service. Otherwise, a driver so compelled
would drive away from the servicing mechanic with a replacement TCM containing
the old ATIC 91 chip and which therefore suffered from the same risk of failure
that caused her to bring the vehicle in. In no rational
sense could that be
described as a fix.
385 Mr Cruse’s evidence is that once the new chip was introduced
in production it was progressively introduced into service
stock. The process
of introducing it into production occurred either on 23 June 2014 or
10 November 2014 depending on the model
line and place of manufacture.
However there is no direct evidence as to the specific date that TCMs with the
new chip became available
in service in Australia. The Applicant asks the Court
to conclude that the new TCMs were not available until February 2016 on the
basis that this was when Ms Capic’s car first received a replacement TCM,
despite having been presented for servicing in both
October and November 2015
with a ‘check engine’ light displaying. I do not think this
provides a sufficient basis to
draw a conclusion about the availability of the
new TCMs across Australia. On the other hand, the Respondent has not led any
which would allow me to conclude that the new TCMs were available at an
earlier date nor made a positive submission to that effect.
Because the
software update only began to be installed after 27 October 2015, one
may also infer that in those vehicles where the
15B22 update had not been
installed, the replacement of a TCM would only have occurred when a vehicle was
brought in for service
for some other reason or if the TCM chips experienced the
kind of severe failure where communication was lost for 5 seconds or more,
failure of this order was required to trigger the relevant diagnostic code prior
to the 15B22 update.
386 As at the date of judgment, the Australian cohort of vehicles which were
manufactured with the old chip may be divided into two
classes: those which
continue to have the old ATIC 91 chip and those where it has been replaced with
the new ATIC 91 chip. Subject
to a point about the 15B22 software to which I
turn in the next paragraph, the former continue to pose the real risk
identified,
the latter do not.
387 Amongst those where the old chip remains, a very high proportion will
have had the software update. No submission was made to
the effect that there
was any reason to think that the rate at which the software was updated was
different in the case of those
vehicles which continued to have the old
ATIC 91 chip in them (for example, on the basis that some of these vehicles
might be serviced
less regularly). I infer that since the 86% figure given to
DIRD in September 2017, additional vehicles with an old ATIC 91 chip
to have had their software updated and therefore that, as at the date of
judgment, at least 86% of vehicles are in that
category. In relation to those
vehicles, I am satisfied that the software will detect any solder cracking and
this will rapidly
lead to the replacement of the ATIC 91 (by means of a new
TCM). In these vehicles I am satisfied that the relevant risk of failure
been resolved (provided, for reasons I have explained, that a new TCM with the
revised ATIC 91 chip is available to a driver
prompted by the software to
bring their vehicle in for service). On the other hand, I am also satisfied
that theoretically up to
14% of vehicles containing the old ATIC 91 chip
have not had the update and in them a real risk of failure remains.
Safety issue?
388 The Applicant
contended that the TCM solder issue represented a safety issue prior to the
introduction of the 15B22 software update.
The first question which arises is
why this matters. The actual question for determination is whether the vehicles
were of acceptable
quality within the meaning of ACL
The safety risk
the Applicant puts forward is that which arises from the ATIC 91 chip and
is limited to the symptom consisting of
a total loss of motive power. If one
makes the assumption that the Applicant succeeds in proving that, as sold, the
vehicles had
a real risk of a total loss of motive power whilst driving then the
question is whether a vehicle with that real risk is of acceptable
within the meaning of
If on the other hand, the Applicant fails to
show the existence of such a real risk then the issue does not seem to arise.
view of affairs, the question of whether the real risk was also a safety
risk does not seem to matter very much.
389 However, the parties were united in their view that this was something
they should debate. The Applicant said that it arose by
reason of the
allegation at 4FASOC §6AB(e) which does, indeed, refer to safety although
for myself I would not be sure that
by itself that makes the question of safety
a legal one calling for determination. One of the difficulties in resolving the
is that the word ‘safe’ in
is not defined and is, in its
nature, somewhat amorphous. For example, all vehicles in Australia can be said
to present a safety
risk. In 2019, 739 people in cars were killed in transport
accidents (I have taken judicial notice of this fact for the reasons
the end of these reasons at [956]). This is a lot of people. If a kitchen
kettle exacted such a toll it would surely be
banned. However, a car is not a
kettle and at some level society seems to accept that a certain degree of
carnage on the roads is
a justified cost to bear in return for the general
social benefits that motor vehicles otherwise provide. The fact that a safety
calculus may involve societal inputs of that kind is reflected in the fact that
there are several ways cars could be made much safer.
For example, the road
toll would surely plummet if car ignition systems were fitted with a
breathalyser that would not permit the
vehicle to be driven by a person who was
drunk. No doubt too, many deaths and severe injuries would be avoided if car
engines were
fitted with a governor which limited the speed of the vehicle to
60km/h. But I hesitate to say that vehicles lacking those features
safety risk even though hundreds of lives each year might be saved by the
introduction of these very simple and inexpensive
engineering solutions. The
point for present purposes is that safety is a complex concept involving an
assessment of upside and
downside risks and to a degree societal standards.
When presented in the context of a legal debate untethered from any suggested
legal standard, there is a risk that the debate will be meaningless.
390 Having registered my objection to the question, it is then appropriate to
consider the position of the two chips. I can deal
with the ATIC 106 chip
very briefly. The Applicant has failed to show the existence of the risk of
symptoms posed by this chip independent
of the ATIC 91 and the question
therefore of whether it was also a safety risk cannot be assessed. In any
event, I did not really
apprehend that the Applicant’s submission about
safety was directed at the ATIC 106.
391 Turning then to the position of the ATIC 91 chip, I have accepted that
there was a real risk that vehicles in the cohort might
develop solder cracking
and therefore a real risk that the vehicles equipped with an old ATIC 91 might
develop symptoms associated
with that risk. The only risk which was put as a
safety risk was the risk that there might be a loss of motive power for a period
of sustained duration, perhaps a few seconds or more. This was a symptom which
would only appear after earlier symptoms such as
shudder or a very brief power
drop had gone unremedied. And it may also have been preceded by lights
appearing on the dashboard
when the symptoms made themselves known.
392 The question then is whether that risk is a safety risk. If one takes
out of the picture the antecedent symptoms including the
flashing lights on the
gear selector so that the first and only symptom of the solder cracking was a
sustained period of loss of
motive power, then I would not hesitate to describe
the risk to safety as real. On this, admittedly artificial, hypothesis there
would be a real risk of solder cracking which would first manifest itself when
the vehicle suddenly lost power. That could happen
in an overtaking situation
or midway through an intersection. The potential for a serious accident is
393 What makes the situation more complex is that, as the Respondent submits,
long before a driver experienced that power loss, there
would have been a range
of lesser symptoms of increasing severity and the display of flashing lights on
the gear selector. Here
the thinking is that these symptoms and those flashing
lights would have been likely to cause the driver of the vehicle to take it
for servicing. On this view, whilst there might be a risk of ultimate loss of
motive power this risk must be much reduced by
the practical reality that very
few vehicles are likely to be driven to the point where it materialises.
394 I have found this a difficult submission to assess. My initial
impression of the problem was that one needed to identify what
the risk of this
particular symptom was. Whilst I have accepted that there is a real risk of
solder cracking and hence a real risk
of the symptoms associated with solder
cracking, this statement does not permit one to deduce anything about the risk
of a particular
symptom. Conceptualised that way, this suggests that it was one
for the Applicant to prove as the party bearing the onus of proof.
If so, then
the fact that the evidence does not permit any conclusions to be drawn entails
that the Applicant fails to show that
the risk of a total loss of motive power
was a real risk and, therefore, that it was a safety risk.
395 A corollary of that line of thought would be, in fact, that the Applicant
fails to prove that there is a real risk of any particular
symptom. This
follows because the same argument can be made in relation to each individual
symptom. This leads one to the curious,
although not necessarily logically
indefensible position, that there is a real risk of the set of symptoms but no
real risk in relation
to any individual symptom.
396 Another way of looking at the problem, however, is this. There is a real
risk of solder cracking and hence of the symptoms it
entails. Those symptoms
include a total loss of motive power for a sustained period of time. Indeed,
this was not in dispute on
the evidence. Having accepted that that symptom was
amongst the class of symptoms of which there was a real risk, the challenge
becomes how to accommodate the fact that it is the end-stage symptom into the
analysis. Here the answer may lie in the distinction
between the legal burden
of proof (which at all times lay on the Applicant) and the evidentiary burden
(which might, depending on
the circumstances, shift).
397 I think this second way of looking at the problem is better than the
first. There are two reasons for this. First, I am concerned
artificiality identified in the penultimate paragraph although I accept that it
is not an incoherent outcome. Secondly,
the nature of the proposition under
consideration, on inspection, shows that it was really a defensive proposition
put forward by
the Respondent and was not something which the Applicant was
required to negative. The relevant propositions were these:
(1) there was a real risk of solder cracking;
(2) there was therefore a real risk of the symptoms associated with solder
(3) those symptoms included a complete loss of motive power for more than a
transitory period of time; but
(4) the risk of that symptom was so small as not to constitute a safety risk
because the nature of the anterior symptoms would have
caused the vehicle to be
serviced before there ever could be a complete loss of power for more than a
transitory period of time.
Framed that way, it is apparent that the fourth proposition was a matter for
the Respondent to prove and not a matter for the Applicant
to disprove. The
Applicant bore the onus of proving that there was a risk (or real risk as I have
preferred to characterise it).
She proved that there was a real risk of solder
cracking and that the symptoms which could flow from that included a
non-transitory
total loss of power. At that point the evidentiary burden
shifted to the Respondent to prove that, in fact, the symptom would never
arisen because the vehicle would have been serviced on the occurrence of the
earlier less severe symptoms.
398 I am not satisfied that the evidence makes good that contention. No
doubt the idea that many vehicles would be presented for
service before arriving
at a complete loss of motive power for more than a transitory period of time has
an anecdotal attractiveness.
However, I do not think that just because I can
follow the line of thought that it proves it as a fact. No doubt for many
this will be true but I do not think I can say it is inevitably so.
Further, there is the additional problem that prior to at least
mid-2014 but
very possibly up until a later date, if presented for service the problem would
not be fixed because the new TCM with
the revised ATIC 91 chip was not
399 Once that conclusion is arrived at it seems therefore that the real risk
of solder cracking carried with it a risk of a non-transitory
loss of power. As
I have said, I am satisfied that this risk was a safety risk.
400 The Respondent sought to counter this conclusion by pointing out that
DIRD had been satisfied that the ATIC 91 chips did not pose
a safety issue.
I reject this submission primarily because the views of DIRD in no way bind the
Court which must make up its mind
on the evidence before it. The views of DIRD
are, of course, hearsay but no objection was taken on this basis and documents
those views were probably admissible as business records. But the
fact that no witness was called from DIRD to express an opinion
on the safety of
the vehicles does suggest that one should be sure of the foundation on which the
DIRD conclusions were built before
giving them too much weight. It is therefore
necessary to pay close regard to the chain of events leading to DIRD’s
to terminate its safety investigation into the DPS6.
401 The last of these events was a letter sent by DIRD to the Respondent on
17 October 2017 informing the Respondent that DIRD’s
concerns had been clarified. What those safety concerns were and why DIRD was
satisfied appears more completely from two
internal DIRD memoranda. From these
one can determine the scope of DIRD’s inquiries. An internal memorandum
dated 22 September
2017 reported on a visit to the Respondent’s
premises at Campbellfield in Victoria. The DIRD officials were shown a Ford
which had had the software update installed and which was displaying a
live fault code. The Respondent reported that the software
update had now been
installed in 86% of the 70,000 odd vehicle population. Pausing there, this
meant that the rate had increased
from 81% to 86% in the intervening
6 months (the 81% figure appeared in the presentation made to DIRD for 17
March 2017). The report
did not spell this out, but the 86% figure entailed
that there were still nearly 10,000 vehicles on the road that had not had the
15B22 update.
402 The report also noted that all owners had been written to about the
update. The report did not contain any discussion of the
safety risk posed by
these 10,000 or so vehicles, save for the generic observation in respect of each
of the vehicle faults DIRD
was investigating (dry clutch shudder, wet clutch
shudder and the TCM issue) that where ‘a vehicle owner presents their
when the symptoms first appear there should be no issues affecting
safety’. Its focus was instead on the effectiveness of
the software
403 Two matters were not considered: (a) what was the rate of failure in the
vehicles still driving around with the old ATIC 91 chip
in their TCMs which had
not had the 15B22 update; (b) was the rate at which the update had been
installed likely to rise much higher
than 86% in the future?
404 As to (a) DIRD knew nothing. The Respondent’s presentation to it
in March 2017 had not revealed information of that kind
other than in the
delphic graph which Mr Kuhn relied on in his report and which is, as I have
explained above, resistant to comprehension.
Mr Kuhn’s understandable
failure to explain what it means and my signal failure, despite several
concerted attempts, to understand
it either satisfies me that it is unlikely
that DIRD understood it. The implication of this is that DIRD knew that there
were around
10,000 vehicles on the road with a risk of failure. Further, the
presentation in March 2017 had made clear that the symptoms included
of motive power. DIRD did not seek to assess the risk to public safety of
having 10,000 vehicles on the road with a risk
of loss of motive power.
405 As to (b), the take up rate for the software update had increased from 0%
to 81% in the 17 months between October 2015 and March
2017 and then
by a further 5% in the six months between March 2017 and
September 2017. To understand what this signified it would
be necessary to
see how the rate trended across the whole 23 month period. On its face it would
seem very likely that the rate of
updating was dropping off. But how fast? One
would need to have a view about the asymptote towards which the installation
was edging to have a view about this. Without that – even if only in
a rough and ready sort of way – one could not know
even approximately how
many vehicles in the future would be left without the 15B22 software update
while carrying the old ATIC 91
chip inside them.
406 Thus it would appear that DIRD neither addressed itself to the risk to
public safety posed by around 10,000 vehicles on the road
with the risk of a
loss of motive power nor to what this risk was likely to look like in the
407 Then there is an internal advice note dated 22 September 2017 (that is
likely the same day as the report) recommending that the
investigation be
closed. This is signed by a senior official within DIRD. The relevant passage
Safety Issues (will or may cause injury)
The Department has one report of a collision that the complainant attributed to
a faulty PowerShift transmission. However, FMC [Ford
Motor Company] has
indicated that appropriate distance between vehicles is the main contributing
factor, rather than any vehicle
failure. There is insufficient evidence to
suggest there is a systemic safety issue resulting from the issues identified by
408 DIRD therefore knew that there had been a car accident in which the DPS6
had been implicated. DIRD appears not to have been troubled
by this. This was
because the Respondent, who I infer was not present at the accident, told DIRD
that the collision had been caused
by the two vehicles being too close to each
other. The memorandum does not explain why DIRD preferred the
Respondent’s version
to the driver’s which is perhaps curious.
409 To accept the Respondent’s submission that DIRD’s decision
showed that the vehicle was safe I would first need to
be satisfied that
DIRD’s investigation was adequate for the purpose of assessing safety. On
the evidence before me I am not
satisfied of that. Of course, DIRD has not been
heard on this. There may perhaps be other materials which show that a thorough
investigation was carried out. However, I can only assess on the evidence
before the Court the Respondent’s contention that
one should conclude that
the ATIC 91 chip did not pose a safety risk because DIRD reached that
conclusion. The evidence is not sufficient
for that purpose.
410 There is one final remark which should be made. As I explain below in
Section XVI, the Respondent understandably sought to exclude
the evidence to
which I have just referred but I admitted it over objection because it showed
the background to DIRD’s decision.
Now that the Respondent has actively
sought to put DIRD’s conclusion forward to prove the safety of the DPS6
the relevance
of the antecedent decision-making as reply evidence is clear.
411 To the extent that it matters I therefore conclude that the old ATIC 91
chip posed a safety risk in the vehicles in which it was
installed and poses
such a risk in those in which it remains which have not had the 15B22 software
Design or manufacturing problem
412 The parties joined
issue on the question of whether the ATIC 91 (and ATIC 106) chips were
a design or manufacturing problem.
I do not think that this issue matters (as I
have already explained). Lest I be wrong about that, however, it is clear, on
the evidence
in this case, that the problem was a difference between the CTEs of
the chips and that of the PCB. This is a design problem not
a manufacturing
413 Because it will be
necessary to return to this when considering the Applicant’s case that the
DPS6 was afflicted with Architectural
Deficiencies including, relevantly, a
failure to provide for adequate torsional damping, it is convenient to note at
this point the
Applicant’s submission that there was evidence that
vibrations had contributed to the problem with the solder cracking. There
evidence to this effect. Amongst the Getrag documentation previously referred
to there is a table setting out the result of Ford
US, Getrag and
Continental’s joint investigations into the causes of the solder cracking.
It is in these terms:
414 This suggests that it was Getrag and Continental’s view that
vehicle vibration was a factor, albeit it secondary, in the
cracking solder.
The problem is described as ‘X11’. The document contains a slide
devoted to X11. It is in these terms:
415 This suggests that vibration alone did not cause solder cracking but
where solder cracking was occurring vibrations accelerated
the problem (this was
also Dr Greiner’s view). It is not clear from this material what the
vibration being referred to actually
is. It does seem to be a vibration which
is associated with the engine speed. As such I am prepared to assume that it
torsional vibrations. I return to this issue later.
SECTION IX: THE REAR MAIN OIL SEAL
416 At the back of the
engine there is a seal which surrounds the engine crankshaft as it exits the
engine. It is variously known
as the rear engine oil seal, rear main oil seal
or the crankshaft seal. I will refer to it as the rear main oil seal which is
phrase the parties adopted in their submissions. The purpose of the seal is
to prevent engine lubricating oil from passing out of
the engine’s
crankcase and into the bell housing of the transmission. The Applicant alleges
that the rear main oil seal in
the 2.0L Focus had a propensity to leak
which caused oil to make its way into the bell housing and there to contaminate
plates. Dr Greiner thought, and I accept, that if this leaking
occurred it would result in the same range of symptoms as arose from
input shaft seals (discussed above): §512. Mr Kuhn accepted that if
the rear main oil seals leaked then it could ‘potentially’
clutch performance issue: §160. I do not accept that it is a potential
clutch issue. If engine lubricating oil finds
its way on to the clutch surfaces
of the dry DPS6 transmission then, for the reasons which both Dr Greiner
and Mr Kuhn accepted in
relation to the input shaft seals, it will disrupt
the ability of the TCM to be able to predict the frictional qualities of the
lining. This will cause the TCM to be less proficient at changing gears.
If the rear main oil seal leaks then the problems with
the clutch will not be
potential problems, they will be actual ones.
417 Mr Kuhn also thought that in the industry the rear main oil seals
were considered part of the engine and not part of the transmission.
apparent point of this distinction in taxonomy was that if these seals were to
leak the problem should be considered an engine
problem and not a transmission
problem. Mr Kuhn may well be right about that and indeed Dr Greiner
agreed with the suggestion in
his reply report but I do not think it matters.
It is true that the allegation which appears at 4FASOC §6AB(iii) suggests
the alleged deficiency in the rear main oil seals was a problem with the
DPS6 transmission. And it is true that the Respondent denied
this allegation
save for admitting that the rear main oil seal leak was a ‘minor
additional cause of wet clutch shudder affecting
some vehicles’. However,
the Respondent did not in its submissions take any point that a case about the
rear main oil seals
was outside the pleaded case because those seals did not
form part of the transmission but were instead an engine component. Instead
both parties approached the issue on the basis that the question for
determination was whether there was any problem with the rear
main oil seals.
This question of taxonomy can therefore be put aside.
418 The Applicant’s case on this was, as I have said, confined to the
2.0L Focus. The Applicant submitted that the design of
the rear main oil
seal was deficient. To prove that case the Applicant drew attention to a number
of documents in which there are
references to leaking rear main oil seals. I
one of these documents says anything about the
design of the rear
main oil seals or their manner of manufacture or assembly. In that regard, this
may be contrasted with the evidence
of the clutch lining material and the TCM. In each of those cases, there was
engineering
evidence not only from Dr Greiner but also within
Ford US’ own documents identifying a defect in design or manufacture
both). In the case of the input shaft seals, the problems included that the
material selected for the lip was not adequate in the
heat environment of the
DPS6 and that for the inner seal a rubber backing had been used rather than a
steel backing. In the case
of the clutch lining the problem was in the
selection of the B8080 material which did not have suitable frictional qualities
the DPS6 and also because of geometric misalignments arising from the way
the components were manufactured and assembled. In the
case of the TCM, the
basic problem was the difference between the CTEs of the ATIC 91 and ATIC 106
chips, on the one hand, and the
CTE of the PCB, on the other.
419 In the case of the rear main oil seals, however, the Applicant’s
case that there was a design deficiency is not grounded
in any more than an
assertion. At §513 of his report, Dr Greiner was candid in saying
that the Ford US documents he had examined
had not identified any root cause of
the problem of leaking rear main oil seals. More importantly, Dr Greiner
himself expressed
no opinion as to what that cause was.
420 Without an identification of what the cause of the alleged rear main oil
seal leak was, it is difficult to assess the Applicant’s
contention that
they suffered from a design defect because the Applicant does not say what was
actually wrong with them. It is also
difficult to understand without such an
explanation what the attendant risk of failure was since the mechanism of
failure is unknown.
It might be possible, despite that lacuna, to prove
statistically that there was a problem. As will be seen, however, the Applicant
does not attempt such an exercise.
421 Turning then to the documents upon which the Applicant relies, they were
as follows.
422 First, an email dated 11 December 2010 and a report dated
12 November 2012. Neither of these documents was referred to prior
the delivery of the Applicant’s closing written submissions and, for the
reasons I give at Section XVI it would be procedurally
unfair for the Applicant
now to be permitted to rely on them. They therefore form part of a corpus of
documents which I will order
to be excluded from the evidence. In any event, I
do not think they assist. The email does no more than show that on
10 December
2010 a dealer contacted Ford US to report a leaking
rear main oil seal. The Applicant submitted that it showed that ‘there
was an issue with installation of the rear main seal rolling during
installation, and there had been approximately three confirmed
complaints of
leaks in the field at that time’. What the document says relevantly is
As to the rear main seal, yes, there was an issue at TEP
with installation and the seal rolling a touch during installation. However,
have not seen too many confirmed rear main seal leak complaints in the field to
date. Maybe 3 total.
423 There are three problems with this. First, there is no evidence as to
what ‘TEP’ means or what ‘the seal rolling
a touch during
installation’ means. The removal of the ambiguous phrases from the email
and their incomplete paraphrasing
in the submission means that the submission is
inaccurate inasmuch as it suggests clarity where there is none. Particularly
the Respondent has been given no opportunity to respond to this material,
the submission is unhelpful. Secondly, it is unclear whether
the vehicle to
which the email relates was a 2.0L Focus. Thirdly, the email contains no
evidence of a design defect.
424 The Applicant submitted that the report dated 12 November 2012
contained various records of customer complaints which showed that
dealers who
had contacted a service hotline had been told that Ford US had ‘seen the
engine rear crankshaft seal and the transmission
input shaft seals leak’
and were directed to replace the rear main oil seal if it was leaking together
with the clutch assembly.
I accept that the report shows that dealers had
called regarding transmission leaks and had been told that the hotline was
with leaking input shaft seals and rear main oil seals. However, at
the top of the relevant records of customer complaints, including
those cited by
the Applicant at [382](b), it is noted that the vehicle involved was a
1.6L Fiesta and not a 2.0L Focus. The report
is not therefore related
to the case the Applicant advances in her submissions.
425 Secondly, the Applicant relied on a Consumer Driven 6-Sigma report dated
22 February 2013. She submitted that this document showed
non-transmission related leaks (being clutch and seal changes with evidence of
rear main oil seal leak) accounted for 8% of
total leaks at that time. The
report relates to the Focus/Fiesta transmission family program, as its front
page makes clear. Page
2 of the document says that transmission leaks are
ranked third in ‘V48’, which Dr Greiner suggests (somewhat
denotes ‘an internal Ford vehicle system category referring to
automated transmission systems’ but there is no evidence
as to what is
encompassed by the ‘V48’ category and what is not. At p 5 there is
a pie chart which suggests that of
the warranty claims made for 2013 model year
vehicles relating to transmission fluid leaks, 8% are
‘non-transmission’.
The summary comment under the chart says that
‘Non Transmission are Clutch and Seal Changes with evidence of Engine Rear
Seal Leak’. Next to that is an observation ‘Engine seal team
engaged’. I pause to note that this evidence supports
Mr Kuhn’s observation, with which Dr Greiner agreed, that the rear
main oil seal is not part of the transmission but rather
the engine. The
balance of the document does not discuss the rear main oil seal no doubt because
its subject matter is transmission
fluid leaks and the topic of rear main oil
seal leaks was not thought to form part of that inquiry. This rather suggests
more interesting document would be the corresponding 6-Sigma Report
relating to the rear main oil seal issue, assuming one exists,
but the Applicant
did not point to such a document. The report of 22 February 2013
rises no higher than showing that the transmission
engineers considered that in
8% of the warranty claims for transmission fluid leaks there was
‘evidence’ of rear main
oil seal leaks and that the people
responsible for that issue (the engine seal team) had been engaged. There is no
evidence of a
design or manufacturing deficiency in the rear main oil seal or
the method of its installation.
426 Thirdly, the Applicant relies on a special service message dated
28 August 2013. This, too, is a document I have concluded should
excluded from the evidence on procedural fairness grounds. The Applicant is not
therefore entitled to rely on it but even if
she had been I do not think it
would assist her. The Applicant submits that the document shows ‘that
some vehicles may experience
a fluid leak between the engine and
transmission’ and that it instructs dealers to ensure that the rear main
seal was only
replaced after a rear main seal failure was confirmed
‘through appropriate diagnostics’. I accept that the document
this. It appears to be discussing a problem common to the Fiesta and the Focus
which is difficult to square with the contention
that this problem afflicted
only the 2.0L Focus. But regardless, it contains no evidence of a design
or manufacturing deficiency.
Further, whilst it suggests that the problem of a
leaking rear main oil seal was known it provides no evidence as to the extent
that problem.
427 Fourthly, the Applicant seeks to rely on a PowerPoint presentation dated
around 2014 which showed how to diagnose rear main oil
seal leaks. The
presentation is entitled ‘Rear Main Seal & DPS6 Transmissions’
and is also a document to be excluded
from the evidence on procedural fairness
grounds. It contains detailed instructions on how to diagnose an oil leak in
the rear main
oil seal. Largely this involves putting fluorescent dye in the
engine oil and poking around the transmission with a UV light leak
detector. It
says nothing about the prevalence of the problem or the existence of any design
or manufacturing deficiency. I do
not think this document would have assisted
the Applicant had she been entitled to rely on it. It seems likely that given
of vehicles on the road, sometimes there are going to be leaks in the
rear main oil seal and it is useful for the dealers to be told
how to diagnose
that problem when it arises. The existence of a diagnostic aid does not take
the matter very far.
428 Fifthly, the Applicant submits that an email from Ford Asia-Pacific to
Ford US shows that Ford US was aware that there were a
number of cases
where contamination was coming from leaking rear main oil seals and that this
was a worldwide problem. The document
is in fact an email chain which commences
on 18 June 2014 and finishes on 30 September 2014. At
10.01 pm on 18 June 2014 this email
Ford of Australia have identified an interesting concern
when performing the DS6 Intermittent Clutch Shudder TSB. It seems that not
of the contamination cases are coming from the Input Shaft Seals, but there are
a number of cases (about 63 on DPS6 Focus from
FTM Thailand) where the
crankshaft rear seal is leaking causing the engine oil to contaminate the dual
clutch on the DPS6 resulting
in intermittent take off shudder too. Only occurs
on the 2.0L GDi engine as far as we know.
Are you guys aware of this concern in North America?
Can you forward to the right people for the 2.0L GTDi engine for review?
Will try to obtain some pictures from the field for your use also.
It will obviously have an impact on the incidences of contaminated clutch
assemblies (particularly any post-BP cases) and needs to
be incorporated into
any reviews. Please let me know what you find.
Khun Anuwat: can you please raise this with the FTM PVT to see if they can
pursue robust concern ID and resolution through the PD/PVT
LEA channels?
429 This email is discussing the problem which the Applicant is putting: a
problem with the 2.0L Focus. Sixty-three Focus vehicles
manufactured in
Thailand have exhibited the problem. The author seeks information on whether
other Ford entities have experienced
the same problem. An email at 7.39 am
on 19 June 2014 confirms that the problem is being experienced
‘in the rest of the world’.
At 1.53 pm on
19 June 2014 this email was sent:
Team – Please take a look at these slides:
Please note that:
Manual vs Auto trans bar colors change between
the 2... Sorry.
The first slide is by vehicle build date.
The second slide is by repair date.
Note the correlation of Manual trans seal repair dates to DPS6 TSB
Introduction (Though I’ve been told that there is no way
the Auto Trans
TSB is affecting Manual Trans seal Warranty).
To be clear, There will be a few Rear Seal Leaks in the field – every
Plant has a few... But .. these charts clearly demonstrate
the primary issue in
Dearborn Engine, as always, works to improve sealing, and has recently made
another tweak to RTV based upon recommendation of our
technical experts.
The last tweak was in July 2013.
430 The slides referred to are not attached. The highlight is the statement
‘every Plant has a few...But...these charts clearly
demonstrate the
primary issue in my mind.’ Then at 11.28 am on
5 August 2014 an email was sent relevantly in these terms:
It looks like the seals are good but the pan to block
area is the area of the leak.
431 This suggests that the problem was
in fact with the seals.
Then at 6 August 2014 at 4.21 am an email was sent relevantly in
these terms:
Pls review the attached photos showing examples of
misdiagnosed oil pan leaks.
432 This appears to suggest that there were known examples of oil pan leaks
being misdiagnosed as rear main oil seal leaks. The same
day at 8.34 am
this email was sent:
Hoping you could clarify in simple terms for us please:
1. Are your findings that the cause of the customer complaint is (mostly) due
to DPS6 input shaft seal leaks and NOT the rear crankshaft
2. Can you provide a rough % breakdown on the cases you’ve reviewed?
3. Are there any other sourced of misdiagnosis that we should be reviewing in
this general area?
Reason I ask is that perhaps we need to draft some TSB type communication for
our dealers in China to ensure a robust diagnosis.
If that’s what is
deemed is required, then I’d need support from the team to provide me with
the info to help get the
diagnostic right.
433 This calls for further information and ruminates on whether there needs
to be a technical service bulletin to the dealers in China.
The response came
back on 8 August 2014 at 5:43 am:
Hello Carlo.
We reviewed a total of 80 claims using the photos provided.
Here is the break down.
As far as the response:
25% are front cover
30% confirmed trans seals
20% suspect trans seals
25% not enough info
It should also be stated that in North America for the
2014 model year only one returned rear oil seal was a confirmed leaker. The
was rolled.
434 I do not know whether ‘front cover’ means rear main oil seal
but perhaps it does. It also contains the information
that there was only one
confirmed rear main oil seal leak in North America for the 2014 model year. The
final email is on 30 September
Following on from your feedback in early August, I’d like to suggest that
perhaps FNA PT Quality have understated the number
of 2.0Lt engines with a rear
crankshaft seal leak affecting the performance of the DPS6 transmission.
I’ve attached yet another dealer report about this from Australia, and
have had similar responses from many other APA markets.
Dealers are not
convinced this is all DPS6 input shaft leaks, and are going to the great lengths
of preparing detailed teardowns
for the Field Service Engineers in order to
demonstrate their point.
Has there been a similar change in the flow of reports from FNA, particularly as
more vehicles are looked at under the TSB and extended
warranty/FSA for DPS
excessive shudder?
435 This reasserts the existence of the problem, suggests that the problem
may be understated and relays another dealer report from
436 I have set out this email chain to show how difficult it is to draw any
conclusions from it. Certainly the problem of rear main
oil seal leaks is being
discussed. But there is an internal debate taking place and I cannot discern
how that internal debate was
resolved. Some voices in the chain believe there
is a problem with the seals, some appear to believe that it is another problem
(with the pan) which is being misdiagnosed and some believe that the information
is inconclusive. Looking at the exchange as a whole
I do not think it advances
the Applicant’s case. It does show that some people within Ford were
looking at a problem with
the rear main oil seals and were debating how much of
a problem it was. It certainly does not advance a case that there was a design
or manufacturing defect in the seals.
437 Sixthly, the Applicant relied on a presentation dated
2 August 2014 entitled ‘DPS6 Technical Specialist’ and
that it ‘listed the rear main oil seal carrier as a cause of
clutch contamination and explained how to diagnose it’.
It is apparent
from p 3 that this document is a PowerPoint presentation intended to be
used at a meeting because it tells the reader
that there will be morning tea at
10.00 am and the location of the toilets. The people identified to address the
meeting are a Mr
Addison, a field service engineer, and a
Mr Athanasiadis, a foreman and ‘DPS6 Guru’. The meeting
appears to relate to
the delivery of a course, the outline of which suggests its
purpose was to introduce the DPS6 Technical Specialist and to combine
processes and techniques with DPS6 technical skills. There then follows a great
deal of upbeat material about customer
focus (p 14) together with a
reminder (at p 17) that this was an opportunity for personal growth. At
p 27 the people attending are
asked to consider the body language of the
customer to determine whether they are in a hurry and at p 29 the
suggestion is made that
the customer should be offered a warm beverage. The
presentation continues in this kind of vein for many slides. The Applicant
relies on a slide at p 79 which I infer was to be presented well after
lunch. It says this:
Clutch contamination
Input shaft seals
Rear main oil seal carrier

439 I accept that this gives those in attendance instructions on how to check
for leaks in the rear main oil seal and if necessary
to clean and re-seal the
rear main oil seal carrier. I do not accept that this shows the existence of a
design or manufacturing
defect. Indeed, I do not think it shows anything other
than that Ford US was endeavouring to ensure that its field staff could
and rectify problems with the DPS6.
440 Seventhly, the Applicant relied on an email from Ford Asia-Pacific
to Ford US dated 25 September 2014 to show that there had been
instances of rear main oil seal leaks. In fact it refers to one further case
(‘We’ve had a case in Australia...’),
although a later email
in the chain dated 3 October 2014 refers to an unspecified number of
‘cases’. A reply to the
first email dated
29 September 2014 correctly says that the symptoms of such a leak
would be the same as in the case of leaks in
the seals in the transmission (ie
the input shaft seals). The emails contain no evidence of a design or
manufacturing deficiency.
441 Eighthly, the Applicant relies on an email sent by Ford Asia-Pacific
on 11 August 2015 to show that there was pressure from dealers
Asia-Pacific market to develop a TSB in relation to the rear main oil seal
leaks. This is actually the first in a series
of emails, however, reliance is
only placed on this first one. I accept that the email does support the
proposition advanced by
the Applicant. The email chain as a whole suggests that
Ford was concerned to deal with the problem of leaking rear main oil seals
manner that ensured that excessive (or possibly redundant) warranty work was not
442 In addition to these documents, the Applicant also seeks to rely upon
four documents she set out at [385]. The Respondent objected
Applicant’s reliance upon these documents on the procedural fairness basis
that they had not seen the light of day until
the Applicant’s closing
submissions. Below at Section XVI I accept this submission. The documents are
therefore among those
that will be excluded from the evidence. I will disregard
443 Taken all together, I accept that this material shows that dealers had
encountered some instances of failing rear main oil seals
in the field and that
Ford US was aware that there was a problem of some kind. I do not accept that
they provide any evidence that
there was a design or manufacturing deficiency.
The cause of the problem is simply never discussed. Further, although I accept
there were instances in the field there is no evidence as to what the extent of
that problem was. I do not accept that the reference
to 8% in the Consumer
Driven 6-Sigma report dated 22 February 2013 shows that 8% of
transmission fluid leak warranty claims related
to this problem. The actual
statement is not that definitive and really only suggests that 8% of those
warranty claims might have
involved the problem and referred the matter to a
different engine seal team to consider.
444 The first solid piece of evidence about the problem is contained in a TSB
issued on 7 January 2016 on the subject of ‘excessive
transmission clutch shudder on DPS6 “PowerShift” Transmission due to
rear engine oil leak on 2.0L Duratec Focus’.
This TSB makes clear that
the problem applied to certain ‘LW Focus MkII’ vehicles built before
20 September 2013 equipped
with a 2.0L Duratec engine and a DPS6
transmission. Duratec is a kind of engine made by Ford. The problem is
summarised on the
first page under the hearing ‘Summary’:
Certain LW Focus Mkll vehicles built before 20-Sep-2013,
equipped with a 2.0L Duratec engine and DPS6 transmission may exhibit a rear
engine oil leak which could contaminate the Clutch and Damper Unit causing a
clutch shudder concern.
445 No light is thrown on the extent of the problem or its cause. Once a
rear main oil seal leak had been adequately diagnosed, dealers
instructed to replace the seal and clutch.
446 What therefore has the Applicant actually proved about this problem? I
accept that the following has been shown:
(a) There were instances in which the rear main oil
seals leaked engine oil into the bell housing.
(b) If such leaking occurred it would lead to the same symptoms as those which
arose from the leaking input shaft seals.
(c) There were a sufficient number of instances for the matter to be discussed
internally within Ford US.
(d) Disparate views were expressed within Ford US as to the extent of the
(e) The nature of the problem was referred to the engine seal team for
consideration but the outcome of that process is unknown.
(f) A TSB was issued on 7 January 2016. Where the problem was
detected the solution for vehicles on the road was to replace the
replace the clutch. There is no evidence that the seal which replaced the old
seal was any different to the old seal.
(g) That 2.0L LW Focus MkII vehicles manufactured in the period beginning in
April 2011 and ending 20 September 2013 were affected
447 What has not been proven is:
(a) The cause of the problem.
(b) How the problem was resolved in production from
20 September 2013.
(c) What the risk of the problem arising was.
448 It is therefore not possible for me to say in relation to any particular
Focus vehicle that there was a real risk that it would
develop this problem.
Certainly some vehicles developed it but further than that it is not possible to
SECTION X: THE ARCHITECTURAL DEFICIENCIES
449 The Applicant
submitted that each of the vehicles was not of acceptable quality because each
was equipped with a DPS6 which suffered
from the incurable problems of
inadequate torsional damping and inadequate heat management. I have given a
brief discussion of torsional
vibrations in Section IV but it is now useful
to discuss them in some more detail.
Torsional vibrations
450 Because the pistons
in an internal combustion engine fire at different times the crankshaft to which
they are attached accelerates
each time a piston fires in a cylinder. As the
explosion in a cylinder ends the crankshaft begins to decelerate before
accelerating
once again when the next piston fires. Since each piston firing is
accompanied by an acceleration and deceleration this means that
the crankshaft
does not rotate at a constant speed but instead oscillates between a lower and
upper bound. The engine output via
the crankshaft is not therefore a smooth
output but is instead one in which there is an oscillation. This oscillation is
a torsional vibration.
Negative consequences of torsional vibrations
451 The mechanical
phenomenon of torsional vibration is one which manifests initially in the
crankshaft. Unchecked, it can be transmitted
through the entire drivetrain (ie
the system which delivers power to the wheels, also referred to as the
driveline, which combined
with the engine forms what is called the powertrain).
It is apparent from Dr Greiner’s evidence that unchecked torsional
could by themselves give rise to some particular difficulties. These
were (a) upshift and downshift harshness and (b) gear rattle
(also known as
‘grattle’). However, Dr Greiner also gave evidence that
unchecked torsional vibrations could
to the problems which
would arise if the clutch lining material had negative damping characteristics
or there was geometric misalignments
of the clutch components. These were
respectively, the problems of self-excited shudder and forced-excited shudder.
As I have already
discussed above, in fact the DPS6 had both of these problems.
The initial use of B8080 had negative damping characteristics and
which some of the clutches had been manufactured meant that some of them were
geometrically misaligned. I did not understand
Dr Greiner’s evidence to
be that the problems of self-excited and forced-excited shudder would occur
merely because torsional
vibrations were transmitted through the drivetrain.
Those problems might be exacerbated by torsional vibrations but they would not
be caused by them in the absence of some other deficiency in the clutch system.
452 The problems of harsh gear changes and gear rattle, by contrast, were
problems caused by unchecked torsional vibrations. Dr Greiner
thought that gear
rattling would occur when gears which were not presently engaged vibrated
resonantly with the frequency of the
torsional vibration. I infer that gears
which are engaged are locked together with no freedom of movement relative to
the transmission
shafts but with gears which are at rest there is some leeway
permitting them to move sufficiently to vibrate. This vibration would
itself as a rattling sound. Dr Greiner also thought that the torsional
vibrations could contribute to harshness, including
during gear shifts. Dr
Greiner explained harshness in this context meant ‘an unpleasant and
subjective characteristic of noise
or vibration which disturbs the comfort of
the passenger or driver’. Mr Kuhn did not take issue with Dr
Greiner’s explanation
of this phenomenon.
The need for damping
453 The avoidance of
these problems was therefore useful. Dr Greiner thought and Mr Kuhn did not
disagree that in principle it was
a good idea to damp the torsional vibrations
carried by the crankshaft. Dr Greiner explained that perfect damping would
the torsional vibrations transmitted to the input shaft were damped
to zero but he also said that this does not occur in the real
world. There will
always be some degree of torsional vibration carried through the transmission no
matter how rigorous the damping
measures taken to suppress it. Further, the
more effective the damping measures the more likely there are to be related
For example, Dr Greiner thought – and no one else disagreed
– that attaching a flywheel with a damping system to the
crankshaft would
indeed damp the torsional vibrations carried to the transmission. But such a
flywheel has drawbacks. It is heavy
which reduces responsiveness and power and
Mr Kuhn thought it would negatively affect fuel efficiency.
The damping mechanisms of the DPS6
454 In any event, Dr
Greiner was critical of the design of the DPS6 from the perspective of torsional
damping. His evidence was that
vehicles which were fitted with a dry clutch
transmission (such as the DPS6) were inherently prone to torsional vibrations
to other transmission concepts’ and the use of the DPS6
therefore required that there be adequate torsional damping. I do
that Dr Greiner’s evidence that dual clutch transmissions were inherently
prone to torsional vibrations compared
to other transmissions goes very far
because the other transmissions he had in mind were automatic transmissions
which deployed a
torque converter. For reasons which need not detain this
judgment, a torque converter inherently damps torsional vibrations. I
apprehend that Dr Greiner was suggesting that the torsional vibrations
afflicting the DPS6 were in kind different to those
experienced by other
transmissions which used clutches (such as manual vehicles). I accept that Dr
Greiner did say that because
the DPS6 is a dry clutch the friction variability
issues arising at the clutch surfaces are more delicate and that the interaction
of torsional vibrations and inadequate friction material is a particular problem
to look out for. Indeed, as the discussion of B8080
above demonstrates, this
problem in fact materialised in the DPS6.
455 In any event, Dr Greiner gave somewhat more specific evidence about the
problems of the DPS6 with torsional vibrations. He thought
that the DPS6 had
three damping measures:
(a) the connection of the engine to the transmission by
single mass flywheel
cardanic joint
(b) the presence of small
inner dampers
within the clutch plates; and
(c) the programming of the TCM to use ‘
clutch slip
the torsional vibrations.
456 I explain the concepts in italics shortly. For immediate purposes it is
necessary to highlight an architectural feature of Dr
Greiner’s own
evidence. The measures set out in (a) to (c) may fairly be said to constitute
between them a system for torsional
damping. Dr Greiner gave evidence that each
of the measures (a) to (c) could be described as ‘inadequate’ but
question, in my opinion, is whether the entire damping system which
they together constitute was inadequate. Further, Dr Greiner
approached the
question before him as a transmission engineer for which he can hardly be
faulted. The question of whether the damping
systems for the DPS6 are adequate
from an engineering perspective is not quite the same question as whether
vehicles fitted with
a DPS6 are of acceptable quality for the purposes of ACL
For example, it is often said that the Sydney Harbour Bridge is
over-engineered in the sense that it was built much stronger than
it needed, in
fact, to be. In that sense, its engineering was inadequate because excessive
resources had been devoted to achieving
a strength which was of no practical
utility. The bridge however is perfectly adequate from the perspective of all
those who have
driven over it.
457 The Respondent made both these points against Dr Greiner, at one point
somewhat colourfully accusing him of living in an ivory
tower in Stuttgart. I
do not think this criticism of him was fair, although I do accept that Dr
Greiner lived in Stuttgart at the
time the case went to trial. Although this
case does not call upon me to express an opinion as to whether transmission
would think the design, construction and implementation of the DPS6
represented best practice in terms of mechanical engineering,
Dr Greiner’s
contention that it did not, has its attractions. The DPS6 has, on any view,
been an expensive adventure for Ford
Single and dual mass flywheels
458 Returning to the
three elements of the DPS6’s damping system described by Dr Greiner, the
first was the connection of the
engine to the transmission by means of a
single mass flywheel
cardanic joint
. Dr Greiner’s
evidence about these concepts was somewhat technical. The flywheel in the DPS6
was a single piece of iron and
did not contain any damping mechanisms. That
kind of flywheel may be compared with a dual mass flywheel (‘DMF’).
DMF consists, in effect, of two flywheels joined with a spring mechanism. One
plate is attached to the crankshaft and the other
to the drive plate. Although
they turn together, there is some leeway afforded in their interaction by the
presence of the spring
mechanism. This leeway can absorb the torsional
vibrations. As the pistons fire the engine side of the DMF accelerates but
than pass this entire rotational fluctuation on to the second mass on the
transmission side the spring dampers initially contract
converting the kinetic
energy of the acceleration into elastic potential energy in the dampers. As the
piston decelerates the potential
energy is released as the spring damper
expands. The net result is that the oscillation is confined to the DMF mass on
side and does not substantively travel to the mass on the
transmission side. By these means, the torsional vibrations of the engine
isolated from the transmission.
459 Because the DMF has two flywheel masses the single flywheel is referred
to as a single mass flywheel (‘SMF’). There
was really no dispute
that the damping qualities of a DMF were superior to those of an SMF. On the
other hand, the DMF has drawbacks,
too. It is larger in volume and therefore
heavier, which reduces power and diminishes fuel efficiency, although Dr Greiner
evidence that any such diminishing would be more than offset by the gains
in efficiency from being able to run the engine at a lower
rpm without
intolerable vibration. A DMF is also more complex and hence more prone to
failure (as a result of Murphy’s Law).
However, this is by the by.
Whilst it is true that the DPS6 used an SMF and not a DMF it had other damping
mechanisms.
The cardanic joint
460 The next feature of
the DPS6 relevant from a damping perspective is the cardanic joint. In the DPS6
the SMF is connected to the
transmission by such a joint. Both Dr Greiner and
Mr Kuhn agreed that a cardanic joint was essentially a flexible joint which
torque to be transferred between different rotating shafts. Dr Greiner
explained that in the DPS6 the cardanic joint was comprised
of a flexible ring
on the engine side and leaf springs on the dual clutch side which were durable.
Dr Greiner thought that the cardanic
joint could compensate for deviations
between the crankshaft and input shafts. At one stage during the hearing, I
wondered whether
the purpose of the cardanic joint was to address the fact that
the crankshaft and the centre of the drive plate were not aligned.
However, the
import of this aspect of Dr Greiner’s evidence would appear to be
that they are in fact generally aligned but
may, on occasion, cease to be
aligned. This implies that in some circumstances either the crankshaft moves
from its usual position
or the transmission moves from its usual position or
both. It is not clear on the evidence why this would occur but the effect of
Greiner’s evidence is that the cardanic joint overcomes any difficulties
which arise if they do.
461 Dr Greiner illustrated the cardanic joint in Figure 27 in his report.
Figure 27 is as follows:
462 The diagram on the right labelled ‘Variant 2’ reflects the
position in the DPS6. One might have thought that the
leaf springs could have
had the effect of acting as a damper of torsional vibrations but Dr
Greiner’s evidence at §303
was that the cardanic joint itself
provided little or no torsional damping. Mr Kuhn expressed no view on the
matter. I therefore
accept Dr Greiner’s evidence about this.
Consequently, it seems that the torsional vibrations are transmitted from the
through the drive plate and then to the clutch plates without any
substantial diminution.
The inner dampers
463 That is not the end
of the story, however, for in the DPS6 the two clutch plates were each fitted
with a torsional damper which
can be seen in Figure 27. These were called
‘inner dampers’. As I understood it, these dampers consisted of
within the clutch plates. A clutch assembly was tendered in evidence
but the inner dampers are not easy to observe to an untrained
Nevertheless, I accept Dr Greiner’s evidence about them which was, in any
event, not contradicted on this point.
Because it will shortly be relevant, the
inner dampers are essentially a spring mechanism which converts the kinetic
energy of the
upswing in the oscillation to potential energy and then releases
the potential energy as kinetic energy on the downswing.
464 I accept Dr Greiner’s evidence that the mechanical aspects of
damping in the DPS6 were provided only by these inner dampers
integrated into
each clutch plate (and therefore not in any significant way by the cardanic
joint). Consequently, I accept that
the torsional vibrations were substantially
transmitted from the crankshaft to the flywheel and then on to the drive plate
in turn, they were transmitted to the clutch plates.
Mechanically
, the system was designed to damp the torsional vibrations
only by means of the inner dampers within the clutch plates.
Software damping: clutch slip
465 However, the DPS6
had another strategy for damping the torsional vibrations. Dr Greiner said that
the DPS6 also deployed a software
measure, which I assume was controlled by the
TCM. This was a process known as ‘clutch slip’. Clutch slip
the situation which exists when the engaged clutch plate and the drive
plate are not rotating at the same speed. In the DPS6 this
occurs most
obviously when gears are changed and also when the vehicle first starts to move
(‘launch’). The purpose
of the clutch assembly is to bring the
clutch plate and the drive plate to the same speed. This is achieved by
gradually introducing
the clutch plate to the drive plate with increasing
pressure. If performed smoothly the endpoint of the operation should be that
the two plates are held together by static friction and are rotating at the same
speed. Clutch slip in this sense is a transitional
phase between the complete
non-engagement of the clutch plate with the drive plate and the full engagement
of the two plates with
each other.
466 However, clutch slip may be used for other purposes too. In a manual
car, for example, a driver on a hill may keep the car at
rest but nevertheless
in gear by ‘riding’ the clutch. In that case, the clutch is left
partially engaged to the extent
necessary to provide sufficient forward motive
force to stop the car from rolling back. Another use of clutch slip can be to
torsional vibrations. Dr Greiner explained that clutch slip can be used
to isolate the transmission from the torsional vibrations
of the engine. The
manner in which it does so is different to that which underlies the operation of
the damping springs in the clutch
plates in the DPS6. The springs tend to
average out the torsional vibrations. Where clutch slip is used to isolate the
transmission
from the torsional vibrations of the engine it lowers the
transmission speed toward the lowest rotational speed of the engine during
oscillation. Effectively the TCM damps the torsional vibrations by riding the
clutch a little bit.
467 There is an unhelpful issue between the parties as to whether the DPS6
did in fact use clutch slip in this way. Mr Kuhn did not
address this question
in his report. Dr Greiner’s opinion that the DPS6 did use clutch slip in
this fashion is based on a
document produced by Ford US dated 20 August 2012
entitled ‘DPS6 NVH Task Force – Status’. This document was
by a Mr Joseph Borneo who the report describes as a ‘TDE Master
Black Belt’. I assume that ‘TDE’ here stands
for Transmission
Driveline Engineering from its use as such elsewhere in the evidence. This
document was produced by Ford US in
proceeding. At p 6 it has
a heading ‘DPS6 Gear Rattle Physics 101’. Underneath that heading
is this diagram:
468 Dr Greiner’s evidence was a reference to the statement
‘Clutch provides Isolation via slip to reduce engine excitation’.
It is also worth noting that his opinion that the DPS6
relied on clutch slip as a substitute for a hardware torsional damping system
based on a single Ford US document. That document, dated August 2012, contains
no technical data or analysis. It refers to clutch
slip but does not make any
statement about whether that slip was appropriate. It is not clear what the
status of the document is
or the basis for the assertions it contains. Dr
Greiner referred to no other evidence suggesting that the level of clutch slip
‘excessive.'
(Footnote omitted)
469 This submission does not say that Dr Greiner was incorrect in suggesting
that the DPS6 used clutch slip as a torsional damping
system. It points out
that the document does not say that any such use of clutch slip was
inappropriate. This is true but something
of a strawman since Dr Greiner
did not suggest that it did. I am left unclear as to what the
Respondent’s actual position
was on whether the DPS6 used clutch slip as a
method for damping torsional vibrations. If the DPS6 did not use clutch slip as
method for damping torsional vibrations this is something Mr Kuhn could
easily have said. Further, the contention that Ford US would
not know how its
own transmission works is unattractive and I do not think that the Court can be
seriously asked to conclude that
the Respondent did not know, by the time of the
trial, whether the DPS6 used clutch slip as a torsional damping mechanism.
470 Instead of saying Dr Greiner was wrong about this, the Respondent instead
issued the equivocating invitation in their submissions
at [173] set out above
to discount Dr Greiner’s evidence because the status of Mr Borneo’s
document was not clear and
because it contained no basis for the assertions it
471 It is not clear to me why Mr Borneo’s document is of
‘unclear’ status. It seems to be a high level presentation
as part of a project within the Ford US entitled ‘DPS6 NVH Task
Force’. This does not sound like a document
prepared on a whim. It is
not something written on a Post-It™ note or affixed nonchalantly to the
fridge in the staff kitchen.
Further, whilst I am not entirely clear why Mr
Borneo was a Master Black Belt in TDE I did not apprehend that the title was
to suggest he was an amateur. The presentation appears to be the
result of serious consideration from someone who has the appearance
what they are talking about. If the Respondent wants to say that this document
does not show that clutch slip was used
to damp torsional vibrations then a good
place to start with that contention would be to deny the proposition in its
submissions.
This it does not do.
472 I read [173] as a carefully crafted submission designed not to assert
that the DPS6 did not use clutch slip whilst maximising
doubt and uncertainty.
As such, I do not propose to expend any more time on this point and I see no
reason not to infer that this
document means what it appears to say, namely,
that the DPS6 did use clutch slip to damp torsional vibrations. In any event,
I mention below, there are other documents produced by Ford US which refer to
the use of clutch slip to damp torsional vibrations.
473 I therefore find that the DPS6 did use clutch slip to damp torsional
vibrations. Consequently, I find as a fact that the damping
of torsional
vibrations in the DPS6 was achieved by the use of:
(a) the inner dampers within the clutch plates; and
(b) the use of clutch slip.
Did the torsional damping measures remove the torsional
vibrations?
Inner dampers
Greiner thought that the inner dampers provided negligible damping for the DPS6.
Mr Kuhn expressed no view on this question.
The Respondent criticised Dr
Greiner’s opinions on the general basis that they were those of an
armchair expert who had not
actually examined the DPS6. When that criticism is
applied to the present issue it becomes an observation that the question of
the inner dampers provide adequate mechanical damping is a question
inherently susceptible to an empirical answer. In other words,
as I understood
the submission, in the absence of Dr Greiner having actually conducted some form
of experiment on the DPS6 to measure
the damping characteristics of the inner
dampers, the Court should place no weight on his opinion that the inner dampers
negligible damping.
475 That submission is made in a forensic context which includes the fact
that the Respondent has itself made few efforts directly
to engage with any of
Dr Greiner’s engineering contentions. Rather, Mr Kuhn’s approach
involved a methodological attack
on Dr Greiner’s approach. In Mr
Kuhn’s view, as a matter of transmission engineering, one ought not to
hypothesise the
existence of a problem in a vacuum; rather, one should ascertain
from the available data whether there is a problem. If it appears
that there is
a problem then one can start to test various hypotheses until the nature of the
problem is ascertained.
476 This methodology is very much in evidence in the manner in which Ford
US’ engineers approached the various problems which
arose in relation to
clutch shudder. First, the problem of clutch shudder was identified from the
warranty and complaints data.
Then, gradually, the sources of the shudder were
ascertained: leaking input shaft seals (causing fluid contamination of the
surfaces), the negative damping characteristics of the B8080 (causing
self-excited shudder) and geometric misalignment of the clutch
(causing forced-excited shudder). In Mr Kuhn’s view, Dr Greiner had put
the horse before the cart. The correct
place to start was in the warranty and
complaints data to see if there was in fact a problem. Although Mr Kuhn could
see that the
leaking input shaft seals, the differing CTE’s of the ATIC
chips and the PCB in the TCM, and the frictional variability and
damping characteristics of the clutch lining material had each elevated the rate
of warranty claims, that data also showed
that once solutions to those problems
were applied in production, those rates had dropped off. From this drop off in
rates one could
therefore conclude that the problem had been identified and
resolved. (I do not fully accept this: the drop off in rates tends to
that the identified engineering problem was at least one source of the
identified behavioural pathology but it does not demonstrate
that it was the
source because the rate did not drop to zero).
477 Mr Kuhn did not think the data, after the in-production fixes were
applied, suggested the existence of some other problem with
the DPS6. No
occasion therefore arose to consider whether the DPS6 suffered from the alleged
Architectural Deficiencies because
the data did not suggest there was a problem
for which it would be worthwhile formulating a causative hypothesis.
Consequently,
Mr Kuhn thought – in effect – that Dr Greiner’s
opinion about inadequate torsional damping (and heat management)
was a theory in
478 There are, I think, three answers to this. First, as I have said, the
repair rates did not drop to zero. Mr Kuhn put before
the Court his Figure 27
which showed the rate of clutch replacements by production year for Fiestas
including for the Fox Fiesta.
The significance of the Fox is that it did have a
DMF. Figure 27 was in these terms and appears identical to the Figure 26 I have
discussed above at [277]:
479 What one gets from this graph rather depends on what one is looking for.
From the Applicant’s perspective, it shows that
there was a background
failure rate of 1.1% by around 40 MIS for the 2016 production year (as the
dataset concludes in November 2019)
and that this proves the existence of the
Architectural Deficiencies (including inadequate torsional damping). From the
Respondent’s
perspective, it shows that the rate for the 1.5L Fiesta drops
precipitously from 24.3% for the 2014 production year to 1.1% for the
production year which were instead manufactured with the revised friction
material, near the 0.8% of the DMF-equipped Fox Fiesta
and that this shows that
the Architectural Deficiencies cannot therefore exist. The same remarks apply
as I have made above in Section
VII. The limitations of this material are
obvious. It includes neither the EcoSport nor the Focus. It only relates to
which received a clutch replacement. Not included are those vehicles
which were not presented for service and those vehicles which,
whilst presented
for service, did not receive a clutch replacement. Included in the 2013
production year is the 1.6L Fiesta. It
ceased to have a DPS6 in the following
years. It might have been interesting to compare the clutch replacement rate
for a vehicle
which on no view could be suffering from the alleged Architectural
Deficiencies with the 1.5L Fiesta but neither party seemed interested
enterprise. Further, as I have already asked, what does the rate of 1.1% by
35-47 MIS for 2016 production year vehicles
imply? Is this a high rate? Is
there a background rate of clutch replacement for a perfectly well-behaved
transmission? Is this
rate higher than that rate? There are so many
imponderables to this evidence that I am unable to attach any significance to
480 I suppose Mr Kuhn might say that if these rates suggested a problem, they
did not suggest it was a very big problem. However,
once the debate has moved
to that arena, the premise of Mr Kuhn’s attack on Dr Greiner’s
methodology is no longer sound
– there is a problem and all that is being
debated is its size.
481 Secondly, at least in relation to the inner dampers, I am not sure Mr
Kuhn’s criticism of Dr Greiner’s methodology
is as sound as it
appears to be at first blush. I accept of course that the way in which Mr Kuhn
approaches the question is a methodologically
sound process of problem solving.
It does not follow, however, that the approach of Dr Greiner is not itself
sound: there is more
than one way to peel an orange. Whilst the idea of a
theory searching for a problem has a certain rhetorical force it is apt to
theoretical postures which may be quite distinct. For example, if my car has no
battery I can confidently predict it will not
start and, like Dr Johnson, I may
dismiss on the basis of ordinary experience the views of those who demand
empirical rigour. On
the other hand, consider a theory that my windscreen
wipers are decreasing the fuel efficiency of my car because their shape
the thickness of the boundary layer which increases aerodynamic drag.
This is not a theory which stands in quite the same position
as the no-battery
hypothesis and one might well hesitate to affirm its correctness without some
evidence of how the vehicle behaves
in the absence of the offending windscreen
482 Dr Greiner’s opinion about the inner dampers was expressed in these
The hardware torsional damping in the DPS6 is provided
by small inner dampers within the clutch plates; however, these inner dampers
provide insufficient torsional damping. In my opinion, this damping system did
not provide adequate isolation of the transmission
from the torsional vibrations
of the engine. The documents which I have been briefed with suggest that a
similar view was expressed
within Ford.
From an engineering perspective, given the inevitability and magnitude of engine
vibrations,
needs to be done to dampen vibrations. It is
evident to me, based on my knowledge and experience with the various torsional
options available to transmission designers, that the hardware damping
measures included in the DPS6 are of a kind that provide negligible
Consequently, the primary torsional damping measure in the DPS6 is its software,
which I am aware is primarily the option
of clutch slip. In other words, in my
opinion the design of the DPS6 sought to compensate for inadequate hardware
torsional damping
with significant clutch slip to damp torsional vibrations at
the clutch plate drive plate interface.
483 Although the damping characteristics of the inner dampers is not
something I would feel able to express an opinion about, I am
satisfied that
this is something Dr Greiner can comfortably do. He has been involved in the
engineering of many transmissions and
is very familiar with the problems that
can arise with damping systems. Although it is not obvious to me, I accept that
it is obvious
to Dr Greiner. Consequently, I accept that his opinion falls into
the first category I have described above. For a transmission
engineer, it is
obvious that inner dampers located in the clutch plates provide, on their own,
negligible damping in the same way
that it is obvious to me that my car will not
work without a battery. That reasoning is sufficient for me to be satisfied
should find that the inner dampers provided negligible torsional damping.
An additional (but explicitly parallel) reason for reaching
that conclusion is
the failure of the Respondent to suggest to the contrary, let alone to give any
evidence to the contrary. The
operation of the DPS6 is something the Respondent
(and its parent) are uniquely placed to know. I may more comfortably draw the
conclusion that the inner dampers provided negligible torsional damping where
the Respondent has taken the position of staying stumm.
To be clear, I would
have reached this conclusion without relying on that failure.
484 I therefore do not think that Mr Kuhn’s methodological objection
has much traction, at least on this point. For largely
similar reasons, I also
accept Dr Greiner’s allied point that in the DPS6 the inadequacies of the
inner dampers therefore place
the lion’s share of the damping duties on
clutch slip.
485 The third problem for the Respondent’s submission is that Dr
Greiner’s opinions are not isolated but can be identified
in the documents
generated by the engineers working for Ford US on the DPS6. This is not only
apt to corroborate Dr Greiner’s
views (and acquit him of the charge of
living alone in an ivory tower) but also tends to undermine any contention that
the view that
the inner dampers provided negligible torsional damping was an
exercise in theory disconnected from the real world.
486 The first of these is a document entitled ‘DPS6 Lessons Learned
Paper – Summary of Key Issues for the DPS6 Transmission
Project’ and
is dated 22 August 2012. At p 8607 it contains a comparison between the Focus
and the Veloster (a Hyundai vehicle).
Under the heading ‘Dual Mass
Flywheel’ it says:
The Veloster is equipped with a dual mass flywheel while
the Focus is not. The DMF provides enhanced isolation to engine torsionals
requires less slip to provide isolation.
487 I do not take from this that the use of the SMF with inner dampers was
inadequate, only that the use of a DMF provided an enhanced
comparison. I do take from this quote, however, some support for the (presently
unrelated) proposition that clutch slip
was used as a method of combatting
torsional vibrations (as noted above). A second part of this document upon
which Dr Greiner relied
was at p 8584. Under the heading ‘Architecture
Hardware Limitations’ there is the statement ‘Clutch judder on
launch due to limited system damping’. Under the heading ‘Specific
Design Tradeoffs’ the documents says that the
tradeoff was between a DMF
which had good noise, vibration and harshness characteristics
(‘NVH’) and a conventional flywheel
(SMF) whose advantages were
those of cost and performance. I do not take from this document that the
damping characteristics of
an SMF linked to clutch plates fitted with inner
dampers was inadequate; only that it was inferior to that of a DMF from an NVH
of view and superior from the point of view of performance and cost.
488 The second document had the same title as the first, ie ‘DPS6
Lessons Learned Paper – Summary of Key Issues for the
DPS6 Transmission
Project’, but this time was dated 8 January 2013. At p 2999
there is a heading ‘DPS6 Hardware Limitations’
underneath which
appears a graph charting judder sensitivity. Beneath that is a statement in a
box which reads ‘Dry Clutch
DCTs are prone to judder, rattle and other
customer NVH issues due to dry friction variability and lack of damping’.
the dry friction issue to be a reference to the difficulties which were
initially encountered using B8080 as the clutch lining.
I do take from this
document, however, that there was a lack of damping in the DPS6 which was
associated with judder, rattle and
other NVH issues (‘judder’ is
used occasionally in Ford US documents to refer to the subset of shudder
that occurs immediately
after a vehicle takes off from rest).
489 The third document relied upon by Dr Greiner ends up being in substance
the same as the first and may be disregarded.
490 The fourth document is entitled ‘DPS6 Update’ and is dated
December 2016. At p 6968 there is a heading ‘Fundamental
DCT Hardware
Constraints’ under which is a graph beneath which appears the statement
‘DCT Architecture Constraints Remain
After Other Improvements’.
This is followed by three suggested such limitations the third of which is
‘Lack of system
damping contributes to NVH error states (grattle,
rattle)’. I accept that this suggests that its authors thought that there
was insufficient system damping. At p 6972 a page appears which is near
identical to an earlier document and need not be mentioned.
At p 6976 there is
a more detailed explanation of the trade-offs involved in using an SMF over a
DMF. In relation to the SMF it
is said that ‘DMF not used leading to
increased friction variability and reduced robustness to vehicle NVH’.
491 Taken together these documents suggest that Ford US’ engineers
thought that the use of an SMF resulted in a reduced level
of damping which was
associated with customer NVH issues, including judder and rattle. Although the
last document uses the language
that the SMF led to ‘reduced robustness to
vehicle NVH’ it is tolerably clear what that means despite the
circumlocution.
I reject the Respondent’s contention that the documents
are all too unclear. They are its parent company’s documents.
Respondent was fully on notice of the use to which Dr Greiner was going to put
these documents. If it desired to prove that
Ford US’ engineers had some
different view and these documents were inaccurate it was fully at liberty to
call its engineers
(who undoubtedly know more about the DPS6 than anyone else).
492 But the Respondent did not go down that path. It did, however, submit
through Mr Kuhn that the documents produced by Ford US
did not identify
torsional vibrations as a root cause or contributor to the seal leaks or the TCM
issue. Assuming that to be so,
however, it does not follow that there was no
problem with torsional vibrations – only that these two problems were not
connected to such a problem. The submission, in effect, is an artful
form of misdirection.
493 In that circumstance, I accept Dr Greiner’s opinion that the use of
inner dampers contributed negligible damping in the
494 It is then necessary to turn to the issue of clutch slip. Dr Greiner
tended to treat the inner dampers and clutch slip separately
but, in my view,
they constitute a system and must be considered as such at least when
considering the issue of whether torsional
vibrations were being passed through
the transmission. There would be no utility in proving that the inner dampers
provided negligible
damping if it were then shown that the use of clutch slip
was sufficient to damp the vibrations which remained. From a vibration
management perspective, either the system constituted by the inner dampers and
the use of clutch slip is adequate as a whole or it
is not (this is not so in
relation to the issue of heat generation – there may be a heat problem
caused by clutch slip even
if the inner dampers and the use of clutch slip
adequately damp the torsional vibrations).
Clutch slip
495 Dr Greiner thought
that using clutch slip as a form of torsional damping was ‘difficult and
generally ineffective’:
§315. This was because clutch slip was very
difficult to control with the precision required to maintain a given level of
Dr Greiner did
directly say that the DPS6 had failed to
achieve that level of precision. His point was couched at a higher level of
abstraction
and was about the use of clutch slip in general. It was the opinion
of a skilled transmission engineer that this was a difficult
method to pursue
which, when combined with other difficulties, would lead him not to select
clutch slip as a torsional damping measure
if he were designing the DPS6.
496 There were therefore two problems with clutch slip: (a) it was difficult
to make it work well as a damping method; and, (b) it
had other drawbacks. The
other drawbacks are not directly relevant to the present discussion but it is as
well to note them. There
were several: first, the use of clutch slip results in
reduced performance due to less torque being transferred from the engine to
wheels because some torque is given up during clutch slip. That which is lost
corresponds with the difference in the rotational
speeds of the drive plate and
the clutch plate, as the clutch plate rotates at the lower bound of the drive
plate’s oscillating
speed. This can also lead to delayed gearshifts.
Secondly, the energy loss in that rotational gap is expended largely through
friction forces at the clutch plate–drive plate interface and is
converted into heat. Thirdly, the opportunities for the clutch
to cool via air
convection between events of clutch slip inherent in ordinary gear changes are
reduced when the clutch remains in
a state of continuous slip even when not
changing gear. Thus not only does clutch slip generate its own heat when used
as a torsional
damper but it disrupts the ordinary passive cooling of the
clutches between gear changes. Fourthly, because some of the torque output
the engine is being used to fund the clutch slip, the amount of power
transmitted to the wheels is necessarily decreased. To
obtain the same power
which would have been transmitted to the wheels but for the use of clutch slip
it is therefore necessary for
more torque to be produced by the engine.
Consequently, the use of clutch slip as a torsional damper increases fuel usage
and correspondingly
decreases fuel efficiency. Fifthly, the use of clutch slip
increases the wear on the clutch.
497 Returning then to the adequacy of clutch slip as a damping mechanism, Dr
Greiner thought that the difficulties which inhered in
its deployment as such
meant that it was normally only used in combination with ‘an adequate
torsional damping solution’.
As I understood his opinion, it was
difficult to control the clutch slip with sufficient precision to maintain a
consistent level
of damping: §315. Dr Greiner did not rule out the use of
clutch slip as a damping strategy altogether. He accepted that it
could be used
‘in a limited way and in combination with an adequate torsional damping
solution, such as a DMF or an SMF with
an outer damper’. It was because
he had concluded that the inner dampers in the clutch plates contributed only
torsional damping that he therefore thought that the use of clutch
slip in the DPS6 was not appropriate.
498 I have found this aspect of the case difficult. For although Dr Greiner
thought that it was difficult to control the clutch slip
sufficiently to
maintain a consistent level of damping he did not say it was impossible.
Further, he did not explicitly state that
the way in which clutch slip was
implemented in the DPS6 had failed to surmount the real difficulty he
identified. However, I accept
that it is tolerably clear that Dr Greiner did
not think that the DPS6 had surmounted the difficulties he identified, even if
did not say so in terms. This is for two reasons. First, it was clearly his
opinion that the DPS6’s implementation of clutch
slip was not an adequate
damping solution in the absence of appropriate hardware damping (and he did not
think that the DPS6 did
have appropriate hardware damping): §317.
Secondly, he did say that the torsional damping measures in the DPS6 were not
to isolate the transmission from the engine: eg §303. It is
difficult to reconcile those statements with the proposition that
the DPS6 had
successfully damped the torsional vibrations using clutch slip. I therefore
accept that Dr Greiner thought that the
use of clutch slip in the DPS6 had not
surmounted the problems he identified and therefore was not a sufficient method
torsional vibrations.
499 Should Dr Greiner’s opinion on this matter be accepted? Here we
are considering the problems generated by the failure to
damp the vibrations
adequately and are not yet examining the issue of any additional heat generated
by the use of clutch slip. Further,
we are examining the Applicant’s
contention that the failure to damp the torsional vibrations adequately was an
architectural
deficiency, ie one that inhered in the very design of the DPS6
which persisted even when the three proven Component Deficiencies
were resolved.
500 It is not enough to say that the damping was inadequate per se. This is
because this is a case under ACL
and the Applicant needs to show that the
vehicles were not of acceptable quality. That question is a consumer-facing
That torsional vibrations are not adequately damped is not a
proposition about which a consumer might be concerned unless it gave
some problem which interfered with the performance of the vehicle. To be clear,
this is not to say that the true question
in the case is the presence of some
undesirable symptom. As I explained in Section III above, the basis on which
the case has been
run is that the Applicant must prove that the Affected
Vehicles suffered from various risks of failure, where failure manifested
symptomatically. In order to do this, she has chosen to rely principally on
Dr Greiner’s evidence to provide the engineering
explanation for why
the various risks existed. The point for present purposes is the corollary one:
it is not enough for the Applicant
to demonstrate merely the existence of some
engineering attribute (a level of damping below that which a transmission
engineer like
Dr Greiner would expect) unless that attribute gave rise to a
relevant risk of failure – ie that the vehicle would exhibit
undesirable
symptoms or behaviours.
501 Of the five problems Dr Greiner identified as being contributed to by
inadequate torsional damping, three of them depended on
either the presence of
B8080 or the previously discussed geometric misalignment issues with the clutch
components. Only two of them
arose purely from inadequate damping by itself:
harsh gear shifts and gear rattle. The three which related to B8080 or the
misalignments
in the clutch components cannot be, in my view, truly
architectural because the replacement of B8080 with RCF1o shows that the problem
of negative damping and frictional variability is surmountable. The same is
true for the resolution of the problems in production
with the clutch
components. This is not to say that the torsional vibrations cannot be a
problem in those vehicles which still have
B8080, only that those vehicles
already have a problem because they have B8080 and, in a sense, the fact that
the torsional vibrations
exacerbate that problem does not add much to the
analysis. (I leave out of this observation the difficult position of the
half-hybrid
clutch about whose efficacy neither party succeeded in demonstrating
anything – it will be necessary to revisit this when considering
question of where the onus of proof lay). I note for completeness that in
Table 8 in his first report, Dr Greiner lists ‘Architecture
Deficiencies – Damping’ as one of six root causes of shudder, with
the choice of friction material also implicated.
However I do not regard this
inclusion in Table 8 as sufficient to establish that inadequate torsional
damping would lead to shudder
in transmissions with the RCF1o material in the
absence of any evidence as to the mechanism by which this would occur. Indeed,
of the other six root causes to which Dr Greiner points is
‘Component Deficiency – Rear Main Oil Seal’ and, as
in Section IX, I have not accepted the Applicant’s case on that
502 Consequently, for present purposes the issue is whether the vehicles
fitted with a DPS6 had a real risk of displaying harsh gear
shifts and gear
rattling (that is the two symptoms
associated with B8080). A harsh
gear shift occurs when the clutch plate is introduced to the drive plate
rapidly. In such a circumstance,
the speed of the clutch plate comes up to the
speed of the drive plate rapidly. Inherently, the period of time during which
state of clutch slip continues is shorter. As Mr Kuhn explained, in some
circumstances, harsh gear shifts are a virtue. For example,
‘sportier’ gearboxes typically use less clutch slip. When the gear
is changed it is fully engaged more quickly
which gives the driver a sense of
putting the vehicle through its paces. Of course, such behaviour is not to
everyone’s taste.
And, of course, there must be limits to the concept.
Dr Greiner thought that harsh gear shifts could arise ‘due to essentially
undamped torsional vibrations’. I do not quite understand that as an
explanation. In particular, I do not understand, if
the torsional vibrations
have passed from the crankshaft, via the SMF, through the drive plate and then
onto the clutch plate, why
this would cause the gear shifting to use less clutch
slip or, correlatively, for a gear change to be more rapid. As I understood
problem with the inner dampers, the difficulty was that they were located in the
clutch plates and were not sufficient to prevent
the torsional vibrations
passing through to the rest of the transmission.
503 On the other hand, there is no difficulty in understanding Dr
Greiner’s evidence about the rattling of gears. The torsional
simply cause unloaded gears to vibrate and rattle as a result of resonance.
504 Nevertheless, Dr Greiner thought that both problems would result from
inadequate torsional damping. But this brings one back
to Mr Kuhn’s point
that one ought not to speak about problems at a theoretical level but should
instead ask whether there is
a problem in the first place. On this view, before
accusing the DPS6 of harsh gear shifts and rattling gears one should pause to
consider whether it actually suffered from those problems (or a risk of those
505 The documents set out above at [486]-[490] provide some evidence that
torsional damping in the DPS6 was associated with customer
NVH issues, including
judder and rattle and that the use of an SMF led to ‘reduced robustness to
vehicle NVH’. Beyond
this the evidence does not go very far. The
warranty and complaints data is of no use to either party on this question for
proves nor disproves the existence of these two problems.
506 I have concluded, on balance, that it is shown that the DPS6 had the
tendency to rattle due to the use of the inner dampers and
clutch slip. I
accept Dr Greiner’s evidence about rattle which is supported by the Ford
US documents set out above. I do
not feel that I can safely conclude that harsh
gear shifts resulted from the use of inner dampers and clutch slip because (a)
is not referred to specifically in the documents upon which Dr Greiner
relied beyond general observations about NVH issues and judder
significantly (b) I do not understand Dr Greiner’s explanation of the
phenomenon. In his report in reply at §66
Dr Greiner made some more
comments about harsh gear shifts but this time he linked the problem to
frictional variability in the clutch
lining material. He had explained that
problem at §583 in his report in chief in terms which I can readily follow.
it is not an explanation of how harsh gear shifts can result from
torsional vibrations in the absence of variability in the friction
507 For completeness, I have not disregarded Dr Greiner’s oral
evidence beginning at T1168.4 that:
The other effect of these [torsional damping] systems is
to reduce the propensity of NVH problems in the car. Yes. It has –
is only a minor influence on the clutch engagement and disengagement, from my
experience. And it is very tough to say here,
in the DPS6, because there is no
DMF investigated with regard to the clutch problems they had, so I can hardly
say whether it was
there. From my experience is, when you introduce a DMF, the
launches and the shifts, they are much smoother with that. The reason
is because the DMF is reducing the torsional speed or the speed fluctuations to
an amount – a very low amount –
before this fluctuation is going
into the clutch. Yes? The drive plate, that is seeing the reduced torsional
vibration from the engine
already. So – and that – this impact is, I
can only describe it like it is smoothing the launches, because the speed
fluctuations are much slower and it is smoothing the gear shifts because of
that. So that’s the main purpose of a DMF or torsional
damping system
integrated in the automatic transmission.
508 Although this suggests that a DMF improves the smoothness of launches and
gear shifts, it does not solve the explanatory deficit
I have referred to.
509 Finally, on this topic, much of the case in Court was taken up on the
issue of shudder. Dr Greiner’s evidence did not suggest
that shudder
arose only by reason of the inner dampers and the use of clutch slip. He
confined his comments on shudder and torsional
vibration to those cases where
the clutch lining or component assembly was implicated.
Heat management
510 This is not the end
of the issue however for there was a second string to Dr Greiner’s
evidence and this was what was said
to be the generation of excess heat in the
transmission when clutch slip was used. Dr Greiner explained that the use of
clutch slip
gave rise to this problem. He thought it exacerbated the frictional
variability of the clutch lining material (ie B8080) and was
itself aggravated
by reliance on passive air circulation within the bell housing as a method for
cooling. I have dealt with the
problems with the B8080 material in Section VII
above. For present purposes, the important point is that even if the use of
slip with the SMF and inner dampers was sufficient to damp the torsional
vibrations, the clutch slip came with its own suite of problems
relating to
511 Dr Greiner had a number of solutions to the heating problem. These
included putting a fan in the transmission and widening the
spread of gears so
that gear changes took place less frequently. I will be forgiven for not
setting out in detail Dr Greiner’s
detailed analysis of the cooling
solutions. However, as will be seen I do not think that it is necessary to
consider them.
512 This is because they lead nowhere. Assuming in the Applicant’s
favour that the use of clutch slip generated heat and that
the heat management
system was not sufficient to deal with this, the question then arises: what
actual problem did this cause? By
itself a hot transmission does not translate
into a vehicle which is not of acceptable quality within the meaning of
There must be something about the excess heat which impacts
negatively on a consumer’s enjoyment of a vehicle fitted with
513 As I understood Dr Greiner’s evidence, the problem with unwanted
heat in a dry clutch assembly was that the frictional qualities
of the clutch
lining material were highly temperature sensitive. In short, as the temperature
increases the frictional qualities
of the clutch lining become unpredictable.
When the behaviour of the clutch lining is unpredictable this makes it
increasingly difficult
for the TCM to make accurate decisions about how to
control the clutch plates. This leads to a range of symptoms such as difficult
gear changes.
514 Dr Greiner accepted at §335 of his report in chief that the use of a
friction material with more consistent behaviour at
the high temperatures
experienced in the DPS6 was, in theory, a solution. However, he did not believe
such a material had been available
to Ford US and, so far as he was aware, such
a material did not exist. Dr Greiner accepted that the friction material (ie
had been changed in the Fiesta vehicles (as I have discussed in Section
VII) and he accepted that the change in material had ‘somewhat
the inadequate heat management issue’ but it had not overcome the
architectural problem. I take that to be a statement
that the switch from B8080
to RCF1o in the Fiesta had not completely solved the heat problem and for that
reason the alleged Architectural
Deficiency continued to exert its influence.
Under cross-examination Dr Greiner accepted that the switch from B8080 to RCF1o
the Fiestas had been an effective measure for addressing dry shudder, whilst
maintaining that there continued to be an underlying
issue of inadequate heat
management. However his oral evidence on this matter also did not point to any
problems independently arising
from excessive heat in the transmission but
rather suggested that without adequate heat management, RCF1o would suffer the
same performance
issues as the original B8080 material, albeit to a much lesser
515 That accepted interdependence of any heat related issues and the clutch
lining material marks, I think, the end of the case based
on the alleged
Architectural Deficiency of inadequate heat management. The fact is that an
appropriate clutch lining can be selected
which deals with the heat environment
of the DPS6 and, indeed I have found that such a clutch lining was installed in
the later Fiesta
516 Even if I had accepted that RCF1o was not itself an adequate solution,
this would not detract from this conclusion. Whilst one
may accept that the
design (or architecture) of the DPS6 leads to a particular heat profile this
does not entail that it is an Architectural
Deficiency in the sense the
Applicant used that expression unless it is also shown that the problems to
which it gives rise are themselves
irremediable. In this case that would
require one to show not only that B8080 and RCF1o were not sufficient in the
heat environment
of the DPS6 but also that there was no clutch lining material
which could be sufficient. The proof of such a negative proposition
attempted in this case but its proof was a necessary incident of the
Applicant’s allegation that the heat management
‘architectural’ and therefore irremediable. To say that something
cannot be remedied is to cast upon oneself
the burden, heavy perhaps, of proving
that remediation is not possible. I do not think that has been demonstrated
even if I were
to accept that RCF1o was itself not an adequate solution.
517 In any event, regardless of where one ends up on the adequacy of RCF1o
this means that the alleged Architectural Deficiency of
inadequate heat
management is not incurable. In fact, whilst it might well be able to be
remediated by introducing a superior cooling
system, it can also be remediated
by changing the clutch lining material to something which can handle the
518 It is an interesting thought experiment in relation to those vehicles
which still contain clutches made from B8080 whether the
defect is the clutch
lining material or, on the other hand, the combined effect of the use of clutch
slip as a torsional damper together
with a cooling system not sufficient for the
clutch lining to perform optimally. Perhaps the better view is that the DPS6 is
and it is erroneous to compartmentalise its operation into different
integers. As originally configured, the DPS6 displayed symptoms
derived from
the B8080 clutch lining material behaving unpredictably due to the temperature
at which the DPS6 could operate. This
problem can be fixed three different
ways: (a) stop using clutch slip; (b) improve the cooling of the transmission;
or, (c) find
a clutch material which can tolerate the heat. It is difficult to
see how one can describe a failure to adopt any of (a)-(c) as
a deficiency if
one of them is adopted. The use of clutch slip will be relevantly harmless if
the clutch lining can operate in the
heat environment. The original clutch
lining material B8080 will be adequate if clutch slip is not used. The use of
clutch slip
with B8080 will be adequate if a sufficient cooling mechanism is
provided. It is therefore unhelpful to think in terms of whether
elements in the transmission are adequate. The question is only meaningful when
considered on a system-wide basis.
519 In reaching that conclusion I do nevertheless accept that it is possible
to offer an engineering opinion on whether a transmission
designed so that these
choices have to be made is of a sound design. I also accept that (a)-(c) might
differ in terms of cost, difficulty
of implementation and efficiency so that it
might be possible to say that a transmission engineer might look askance at one
of them. However, the focus in the present case is on whether the
transmission worked. Useful comparison may be made with the question
the Sydney Harbour Bridge is sufficient to carry cars as opposed to the question
whether its design is efficient. Questions
of such engineering standards are
not therefore directly relevant to this case. No doubt the DPS6 could have been
designed better,
perhaps much better, but here the question is whether it was
functional.
The position of the Respondent
520 On the evidence put
forward by the Applicant the conclusion I would draw, therefore, is that the
damping provided by the DPS6
was such that the Affected Vehicles carried a
prospect that their gears might rattle. This rattle was the result of the
measures in the DPS6 permitting torsional vibrations to be transmitted
to the transmission shafts in the gearbox.
521 However, the Respondent itself submitted that vehicles fitted with a DPS6
displayed five characteristics that were normal operating
characteristics. Mr
Kuhn was asked to comment on each of them but their significance for present
purposes is that the Respondent
accepts that these characteristics are part of
the DPS6’s normal operation. The characteristics are:
(a) a slight vibration or shudder under light
acceleration at slow speeds or during a coast down, as the transmission upshifts
downshifts;
(b) firm gear shifting under aggressive acceleration;
(c) a slight audible rattle, particularly when operated within an enclosed area
such as a carpark;
(d) mechanical sounds when shifting, or after the vehicle has been turned off;
(e) a slight shunting sensation at very low speeds.
522 It will be seen that (c) corresponds with what I have accepted the
Applicant succeeded in proving.
523 Although I was not persuaded by Dr Greiner’s evidence about (b)
firm gear shifting (because I did not follow his explanation),
it is apparent
that the Respondent accepts that the DPS6 does exhibit firm gear shifting under
aggressive acceleration as an ordinary
part of its operation. I so find. I am
unable to say whether the firm gear shifts are a consequence of the transmission
of torsional
vibrations through the drivetrain due to the low level of torsional
damping provided in the DPS6. I could not follow Dr Greiner’s
explanation
and the Respondent proffered no explanation.
524 The slight vibration or shudder in (a) is interesting. Dr Greiner did
not give direct evidence about this for, as I have said,
the only symptoms he
linked solely to torsional vibrations were harsh gear shifts and rattling.
However, Mr Kuhn gave evidence that
intermittent torsional slipping in the
clutch assembly could generate a low frequency vibration in the powertrain which
may in some
cases be detected by the driver. Whether it would be detected by
the driver depended on the sensitivity of the driver, the extent
to which the
powertrain was isolated from the rest of the vehicle and the magnitude of the
clutch slip. Indeed, he defined shudder
at the end of his report as
‘powertrain or driveline torsional vibration that can be felt by the
operator or passengers’.
I infer, from the Respondent’s admission
that (a) is an ordinary incident of the DPS6, that at low speeds the frequency
the torsional vibration drops and becomes perceptible as it travels through
the drivetrain. This appears to imply that at higher
speeds the frequency of
the oscillation renders it undetectable. As such, it appears to be an example
where the torsional vibration
is simply apparent to the driver. I accept the
existence of this shudder. It is, I should say, neither an example of
self-excited
shudder nor of forced-excited shudder, that is to say, it is not
something which is related to the frictional qualities of the clutch
any misalignment of the clutch components. In any event, since the Respondent
admits this I find that it is an ordinary
incident of the operation of the DPS6.
525 I make a similar finding in relation to (e), the shunting sensation at
low speeds. Mr Kuhn gave evidence that this term referred
to longitudinal
oscillation of the vehicle, while Mr Cruse compared the sensation to
driving a manual vehicle at slow speed or the
feeling one might experience when
hitching a trailer. Dr Greiner compared it to a rocking motion and classified
it as a subset of
shudder. Neither Dr Greiner nor any other witness gave
evidence to the effect that shunting could be caused by torsional vibrations
independently of the behaviour of the clutch lining and I am therefore left in
the same position as for (b). That is I am unable
to say whether it is caused
by torsional vibrations but since the Respondent has admitted that it was a
feature of the Affected Vehicles,
I find as much.
526 Finally as to (d), the mechanical sounds, both Mr Kuhn and Dr
Greiner viewed them as an expected incident of a dual clutch transmission,
Dr Greiner opining that nevertheless drivers often found them unusual.
There was no suggestion in the evidence that these sounds
were a result of
either torsional vibrations or heat. I therefore accept that they were a
feature of the Affected Vehicles without
attributing their cause to any
architectural deficiency.
527 The Respondent submits that symptoms (a)-(e) are normal operating
characteristics of a DPS6 and hence cannot amount to a breach
of the guarantee
I deal with this contention below at Section XII.
Conclusions on Architectural Deficiencies
Inadequate damping of torsional vibrations
the reasons I have just given, the torsional damping system in the DPS6 was such
as to permit the transmission of torsional
vibrations to the drivetrain and that
this in turn caused a slight shudder at low speeds and gear rattling. I have
also found that
the DPS6 can exhibit harsh gear shifts, produce mechanical
sounds when shifting or after the vehicle has been turned off and to the
that it is distinct from shudder, shunting but I have been unable to say that
this was caused by the transmission of torsional
vibrations.
529 Do these conclusions involve acceptance of the allegation that the DPS6
suffered from the Architectural Deficiency constituted
by inadequate damping of
torsional vibrations? On balance, I think the words ‘deficiency’
and ‘inadequate’
are loaded in a way which is apt to distract
attention from the statutory question posed in ACL
That standard is not
concerned with the engineering qualities of the transmission per se but only
with whether the vehicles were
of acceptable quality. To label the engineering
qualities of the DPS6 with the word ‘deficiency’ or its damping
with the word ‘inadequate’ carries a particular risk that
such a designation will contaminate the assessment of the statutory
Where that word is used in an engineering context that risk is augmented. What
is a deficiency from an engineer’s
perspective may not necessarily be
unacceptable from a consumer’s perspective. Indeed, it is precisely the
prospect of such
an outcome which underpins the Respondent’s contention
that the DPS6 complies with the
guarantee because shudder, harsh gear
shifts, rattle, shunting and mechanical sounds during gear shifts are but its
normal operating
characteristics. Such an outcome is not logically excluded
merely because a transmission engineer might think the torsional damping
provided in the DPS6 could have been better.
530 I therefore do not accept the Applicant’s contention that the DPS6
suffered from the Architectural Deficiency constituted
by inadequate torsional
damping. However, as I have explained I do accept that torsional vibrations
caused 2 of the 5 normal operating
characteristics which the Respondent
admitted. Rejection of this contention does not, however, tell one anything
characteristics meant the vehicles did or did not comply
with the guarantee of acceptable quality in
Inadequate heat management
531 I do not find that the heat management in the
DPS6 was inherently inadequate although I do accept that it was not appropriate
to use B8080 in the DPS6 because of the heat profile.
Connection to the Component Deficiencies
532 For reasons I have
already given, I do not accept that the DPS6 suffered from the alleged
Architectural Deficiencies. I do accept,
however, that the use of an SMF, inner
dampers and clutch slip to damp the torsional vibrations was apt to generate a
degree of heat
which led to the B8080 clutch lining material behaving
eccentrically when sufficiently heated. I have already explained that one
view the problem as being located in two alternate states of affairs:
the transmission ran too hot for the B8080
the B8080 was
not adequate to handle the heat the transmission generated. In any event, I
accept the Applicant’s submission
that the B8080 problem was causally
connected to the use of an SMF, inner dampers and clutch slip as torsional
damping measures.
However, since I do not regard the use of an SMF, inner
dampers and clutch slip as presenting a problem without the corresponding
B8080, this conclusion does not go very far.
533 The Applicant also submitted that the TCM issue and the problem of the
leaking input shaft seals could be laid at the feet of
the decision to use an
SMF, inner dampers, and clutch slip to manage torsional vibrations along with
the inadequate heat management.
I accept that in the case of the TCM the
problem was exacerbated by heat. The difference in CTE between the ATIC 91 and
and the PCB to which they were soldered was a significant cause of the
real risk of cracking in the solder joints which arose. The
temperatures experienced by the transmission the greater the physical forces
experienced at the solder joints. It is
easy to see therefore that a
transmission configuration which led to higher temperatures would exacerbate
this problem. Again, however,
I do not think this conclusion leads anywhere.
The problem could be fixed by reducing the temperature of the transmission or,
was done, by reconfiguring the TCM such that it was more robust in the given
temperature environment of the DPS6. Similarly, even
if, assuming in the
Applicants favour that torsional vibrations accelerated the cracking process
brought about by the difference
in the CTEs, the changes made to the TCM meant
that this process would not commence in the first place.
534 The same conclusion follows in relation to the leaking input shaft seals.
Although the matter is not as quite as clear in their
case, I nevertheless have
accepted that this too was a problem exacerbated by torsional vibrations and
heat. So viewed, it is causally
connected to the decision to use an SMF, inner
dampers and clutch slip. To be clear, I do not think that it has been shown
the input shaft seals would not have failed if there had been more robust
torsional damping or heat management in the DPS6. The
finding is one of
exacerbation.
SECTION XI: MS CAPIC’S CAR
535 Ms Capic
purchased a Ford Focus on 24 December 2012. From shortly after the
date of its purchase the car displayed a range of
issues relating to its
transmission. Ms Capic gave evidence of these problems in great detail.
Between 14 April 2013 and 11 June
2019, Ms Capic took her car in for
servicing on 15 occasions, first at Sterling Ford and the remaining 14 times at
Jefferson Ford,
and reported the problems with the vehicle on each
occasion. On each occasion that Jefferson Ford serviced the vehicle it
service records. Although Ms Capic’s evidence of the
errant behaviours of her vehicle are much more detailed and provide cogent
evidence of how annoying the vehicle was to her, following the approach of
Mr Carter, the information contained in the relevant service
records can be

536 The three critical events are the replacement of the TCM on 10
February 2016 and the replacement of the clutch lining and input
seals on 30 May 2017. Although Ms Capic’s vehicle received the
15B22 software update on 16 November 2015, as I have
noted above in
Section VIII, there is no basis on which I can conclude that a TCM with the
revised ATIC 91 chip was available for
her vehicle prior to
10 February 2016. As a result, the real risk of solder cracking causing
noticeable symptoms was only removed
with the replacement of her TCM.
537 I infer from the fact that the vehicle’s TCM, clutch lining and
input shaft seals were replaced that those components had
failed. It was not
suggested that I should not reason in that fashion. Since I have concluded that
vehicles in the position of
Ms Capic’s vehicle (ie a 2012 model year
Focus) had a real risk that those three components would fail, this finding is
only that the real risk which existed had in fact come to pass. I am
unable to determine which failure came first or whether they
all developed
simultaneously. However, this is immaterial to any issue which needs
resolution. It is clear that the problems started
within the first few months
she owned the vehicle and were thereafter not fixed (at least until 30 May
2017 – a debate to which
I will shortly turn).
538 Ms Capic gives evidence which suggests that she made somewhat more
detailed complaints than the service records summarised in
the above table
suggest. It does not really matter for the outcome of the case what
Ms Capic said to the mechanics. The vehicle
either was or was not of
acceptable quality and the dialogues which took place between them cannot impact
on that issue. To the
extent that it matters, I reason that the mechanics are
likely to summarise the customer’s complaints in terms which are familiar
to them and to do so in a fairly brief format (as befits a summary). On the
other hand, Ms Capic is likely to have a vivid recollection
of the problems
with the vehicle. I do not read the two sources of evidence as being
contradictory. I accept Ms Capic’s evidence
occurred before 30 May 2017.
539 It is not in dispute that upon the service on 30 May 2017
Ms Capic’s vehicle now had all three original components replaced
the TCM, input shaft seals and clutch lining). Despite that, her evidence was
that the same problems persisted after 30 May
2017. If the only evidence
in the case were Ms Capic’s evidence and the engineering evidence
this might suggest that there
was a problem with Ms Capic’s evidence.
This is despite the fact that the Respondent accepts that Ms Capic’s
will continue to display the normal operating characteristics, as the
problems complained of by Ms Capic would appear to go beyond
behaviours. On this view, there might appear to be no mechanical explanation
for the way in which Ms Capic says the vehicle
has behaved since
30 May 2017 and this would make less credible her account.
540 However, this view would be wrong. Because Ms Capic’s vehicle
is a Focus its replacement clutch was not one with RCF1o
lining material but was
instead a half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch. I have been unable to reach any view
as to whether the half-hybrid
clutch was an effective fix. The logical problem
adverted to in the previous paragraph would only arise if it had been found that
the half-hybrid clutch was an effective fix. As the evidence stands,
Ms Capic’s report of continuing problems after the clutch
replaced is not inherently inconsistent with the engineering evidence.
541 The continuation of these problems also finds some support in the fact
that during the most recent service of Ms Capic’s
11 June 2019, a Jefferson Ford mechanic performing the 250 rpm test
recorded a shudder event of 292 rpm. The mechanic
then programmed the
transmission to perform its adaptive relearning procedure, after which shudder
was recorded at only 151 rpm.
The Respondent submits that no reliance can
be placed on this record. The Respondent relied on the view expressed by
that the 250 rpm test was not correctly performed because
the vehicle had not been brought to a complete stop prior to the measured
acceleration, an observation with which Dr Greiner agreed. While Mr
Carter’s view was that therefore the reading ‘may
not have confirmed
the existence of clutch shudder’, Dr Greiner thought the results
‘quite clearly capture a shudder
542 It is relevant to note that the mechanic’s own notes in the service
record read ‘FOUND SHUDDER EVIDENT AT 292 RPM
SLIP RATE’.
Regardless of whether the procedure was an appropriate diagnosis of clutch
shudder (or alternatively shudder in
the broader sense of including torsional
vibrations from the engine), the continuing symptoms Ms Capic said she was
experiencing
appear to have been also experienced by the servicing mechanic at
Jefferson Ford.
543 Returning then to Ms Capic, whilst I have found her basically to be an
honest witness, I have also found that when pressed into
a corner in the witness
box she might occasionally indulge in mild untruth in the heat of the moment.
No doubt, this is regrettable.
However, I do not think that finding would
warrant not accepting her evidence about the continuation of the problems after
2017. There is a difference, on the one hand, between being
cross-examined unexpectedly about an apparently irrelevant answer in
lease document and, in effect, being caught out making it up on the run and, on
the other hand, concocting a written account
well in advance of the trial. The
latter would involve a degree of calculated dishonesty which does not square
with my basic assessment
of Ms Capic’s character. Further, if one
makes the hypothesis that her evidence about this was concocted, there are
significant
difficulties. First, to do that would be to tell not a small fib
but a large one. In a sense this evidence lies close to the heart
of what the
case was about from Ms Capic’s perspective. What would be involved
in constructing such an untruth would not be
the gilding of a lily. Secondly,
Ms Capic affirmed the first of the three affidavits upon which she relies
after the vehicle had
been inspected by Mr Carter and Mr Marston so
she must surely have been aware that the risk of detection of any such deceit on
part would be high. It is too much to think that Ms Capic would have
544 Further, as I explain below her evidence is corroborated by
Mr Marston’s notes in addition to the motor mechanic’s
the service on 11 June 2019 at [542] above. Although the Respondent damaged
Mr Marston’s credibility to an extent,
it did not do so sufficiently
for me to reject the veracity of his notes which record some of the symptoms
reported by Ms Capic (although
not shudder).
545 For those reasons, I accept Ms Capic’s evidence that even
after the replacement of the clutch assembly and input shaft seals
May 2017, the problems with the vehicle persisted. For completeness, as I
explain further below I do not accept that the problems
were caused by left foot
braking by Ms Capic. The evidence was far too thin for the drawing of that
546 Finally, I accept Ms Capic’s detailed evidence about her
frustrations with her vehicle. These arose because she would take
the vehicle
in for servicing, would be told the problems were resolved and then the problem
would recur. Given the number of times
she had this experience, it would be
rather surprising if she were a contented customer. The component problems with
her vehicle
really only began to be addressed in February 2016 when the TCM
was replaced. But, as I have mentioned in Section VIII, it might
have been the
case (although there was no sufficient basis for concluding) that on no occasion
when Ms Capic’s vehicle presented
for service prior to
10 February 2016 was a new TCM available at Jefferson Ford for
installation. If that was the case, Ms Capic
was in a sense wasting her
time. This is not to blame the mechanics at Jefferson Ford who it may
safely be assumed did precisely
what the TSBs told them to do. In that sense
Ms Capic is wrong when she says she felt that she was being lied to or
played the fool.
Before the fixes were made available to vehicles on the road
the mechanics really had no more chance of fixing her car than she
The independent inspection of Ms Capic’s car
547 The question of
whether the Applicant’s vehicle was defective was the subject of evidence
from two motor mechanics who examined
it. These experts were Mr Carter,
who gave evidence for the Respondent, and Mr Marston, who gave evidence for
the Applicant.
548 Mr Carter tested the vehicle in 2018 and again in 2020. When he
drove the vehicle in 2018 he was accompanied by Mr Marston.
prepared two reports dated 16 May 2018 and 14 February 2020.
Mr Marston also inspected the vehicle on a number of occasions
549 The Applicant did not initially serve any evidence from Mr Marston
but after it became apparent that the Respondent was going
to submit that the
failure to call Mr Marston implied that Mr Marston did not think there
was anything wrong with her vehicle, the
Applicant belatedly applied to adduce
evidence from him outside the evidence preparation timetable. The Respondent
objected to this
being done but I concluded that the Applicant should be
permitted to rely on his late evidence:
Capic v Ford Motor Company of
Australia Limited (Late Evidence)
[2020] FCA 1117.
Subsequent to that
decision the Applicant filed two affidavits by Mr Marston, one of
27 June 2020 and one of 3 July 2020. These
affidavits did not involve
Mr Marston giving much in the way of direct testimony but rather centred on
the production of notes he
had taken of his inspections of the vehicle.
550 Mr Marston was called on the 15th day of the trial, 7 July
2020, at T876. He was cross-examined at T877-940 and re-examined at
Mr Carter was called on the 18th day of the trial, 13 July 2020, at T1109.
He was cross-examined at T1111-1141 and re-examined
at T1141-1144. In addition
to his reports, Mr Carter also prepared an affidavit in response to
Mr Marston’s late evidence
dated 13 July 2020.
551 It is useful to
begin with Mr Carter’s evidence. Mr Carter holds a
bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from
Monash University which
he obtained in 1976. He is a registered automotive consultant with the
Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure
and Regional Development
(‘DIRD’), an engineering signatory with VicRoads and a vehicle
examiner approved by the National
Heavy Vehicle Regulator. He is a member of
several professional bodies associated with automotive engineers. He has also
as a specialist design engineer with a large motor vehicle manufacturer.
He has worked in and around motor vehicles for over thirty
five years. It is
clear that he is well qualified to express opinions on the issue of the
condition of the Applicant’s car.
552 In his first report of 16 May 2018 Mr Carter explained his
qualifications, the program of testing to which he had subjected the
Applicant’s vehicle and his conclusions about the vehicle. He had
assessed the vehicle over a two day period during which
he had been accompanied
by Mr Marston. The first day of testing took place on 24 April 2018 and
consisted of a test drive of around
4 hours duration during which the vehicle
was driven 140 km. In his report he provided a map of the route taken and
he said that
it consisted of suburban, inner city and freeway driving. He also
observed that the vehicle had been fitted for the purposes of
the test drive
with equipment to record audio, video, GPS location and some information
relating to the operation of the engine and
transmission.
553 Mr Carter did not observe any issues with the engine or the
transmission during the test drive.
554 On the second day of Mr Carter’s testing, 26 April 2018,
the vehicle was subject to a diagnostic scan using Ford’s
proprietary
Integrated Diagnostic System (‘IDS’) and an underbody mechanical
inspection. This was done by a Ford Australia
field service engineer at a
mechanic’s workshop (in fact, Mr Carter’s son’s workshop) in
Melbourne. The field
service engineer also performed an on-road test for clutch
shudder using Ford’s IDS with Mr Carter present. The result of
examinations was that he did not detect any issues with the engine or the
transmission.
555 After the delivery of Mr Carter’s first report the
Respondent’s solicitors were keen to reconcile the Applicant’s
evidence that the vehicle continued to display a range of symptoms with
Mr Carter’s conclusions that there was nothing wrong
with the engine
or the transmission and that the car was in good working order. They therefore
asked Mr Carter to prepare a second
556 For this second report the vehicle was tested over a four day period,
from 20 January 2020 to 23 January 2020. On the first day
Mr Carter, this time without the company of Mr Marston, drove
80 km around Melbourne including in inner city and freeway conditions
speeds of up to 100 km/h. On the second day the vehicle was again tested using
the IDS. It was also taken to Mr Carter’s
son’s workshop and
put on a hoist so its undercarriage could be examined. On the third day it was
taken on a 50 km test drive
around suburban Melbourne between Camberwell
and Bayswater. On the fourth and final day, Mr Carter drove the
Applicant’s vehicle
with his left foot on the brake pedal to ascertain
whether the transmission problems experienced by the Applicant might have been
caused by the manner in which she was driving the vehicle.
557 Mr Carter’s conclusions remained the same as those in his
first report: there was nothing wrong with the engine or the transmission.
During the diagnostic testing using the IDS leading to his first report a
shudder result of 50 rpm was returned. As has been explained
above, it was
Ford’s position that the relevant threshold over which shudder was deemed
problematic was 250 rpm. While the
Applicant (through Dr Greiner)
suggested that this had been set too high and a threshold of say 200 rpm
would have been more appropriate,
nowhere was it suggested that a result of
50 rpm could be anything beyond a very minor shudder. Assuming such a
shudder to be detectable,
it would in my view merely be an example of the
torsional vibrations being transmitted through the drivetrain at low speeds (not
having been soaked up by the inner dampers and clutch slip). The Respondent, of
course, said that such a shudder was part of the
DPS6’s normal operating
characteristics.
558 In his second report Mr Carter did venture the opinion that one
possible explanation for why he could find nothing wrong with
the vehicle but
the Applicant could still nevertheless report clutch shudder could be that the
Applicant was using the incorrect
grade of fuel or was perhaps driving with her
left foot resting on the brake pedal. Mr Carter did observe a minor
shudder and a
minor noise which he described in these terms:
No abnormal noises from the engine or transmission were
evident during the on-road testing.
Minor vehicle shake when the engine is idling in Park was observed, which
diminished as the engine warmed up and was not apparent
after refuelling with
Premium Unleaded petrol. This could be caused by a failed engine mounting,
sparkplug condition, or fuel type
or quality.
A minor noise at 100 km/h when applying more throttle was noticed on the first
test drive, which could be due to a failed engine
mounting or the fuel type or
559 This is relevant to a submission made by the Applicant to which I will
return. For present purposes, it will be observed that
Mr Carter appears
to be saying that the slight shudder was caused by not using premium unleaded
petrol. An alternate explanation,
which I favour, is that this minor shudder
and minor noise are both examples of the normal operating characteristics of the
which the Respondent accepts and which are, as I have found, the
consequence of the torsional vibrations not always being fully damped
inner dampers and clutch slip.
560 Having delivered two reports of Mr Carter both expressing the view
that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle, the Respondent
observed in its
opening submissions that it was notable that although Mr Marston, on behalf
of the Applicant, had been present with
Mr Carter during the first period
of testing, no report had been forthcoming from him. This led to the late
evidence application
to which I have already made reference and
Mr Marston’s affidavits of 27 June 2020 and 3 July 2020.
561 Mr Marston was
not called as an expert witness but really just to introduce into evidence his
notes of some testing he performed
on the vehicle. Mr Marston is an
automotive specialist and master mechanic. He is a member of the Institute of
Automotive Mechanical
Engineers and has over 40 years’ experience in
repairing vehicles.
562 Mr Marston gave evidence that he had accompanied Mr Carter on
his inspections in 2018 and that, in addition, he had inspected
the vehicle both
before and after Mr Carter’s 2018 inspections. He also observed the
servicing undertaken on the vehicle at
a Ford dealership’s premises on 24
and 25 May 2018 when Ms Capic took it in for its regular service. In
addition, Mr Marston
independently test drove the vehicle without
Mr Carter on 25 May 2018 after the service had been completed.
563 Mr Marston kept notes of his inspections. He was not initially
asked to do a report. Subsequently, when the Respondent said
in its opening
submissions that an inference should be drawn against the Applicant for failing
to call Mr Marston, his notes were
unearthed. Mr Marston thereafter
annotated them in red ink.
564 Mr Marston also gave evidence under cross-examination which
contradicted the evidence of Mr Carter as to what had happened during
test drives. The first of these disputes concerned the initial test drive
conducted on 24 April 2018. Mr Marston gave evidence
at T880.44-46 that
during that test drive he had identified erratic gearbox changing and fluid
noises coming from the gearbox. He
pointed out that his notes of the test drive
included a statement ‘
I noticed rough changing down 5-4-3-2
He stated at T881.9 that following this he
actually asked Mr
Carter if we could re-drive that section of road, and my recollection is that Mr
Carter replied something like “I’m
doing the road test. We will keep
He also said at T893.7 that he could not recall
whether he had mentioned the fluid noise to Mr Carter at the time.
565 Subsequent to Mr Marston’s evidence Mr Carter provided an
affidavit affirmed 13 July 2020. He said that he recalled that
Mr Marston had made a comment about rough gear changing and had done so at
2018 while they were
on the Tullamarine Freeway, past the Essendon Fields exit where there were
roadworks. There was no challenge
to Mr Carter’s ability to be so
precise in his recollection. It may be that it is related to the fact that he
recorded the
entire inspection procedure by video. His evidence about what had
been said about the fluid noise was also very precise. His affidavit
and §7 reads:
Mr Marston did make a comment about rough gear changing.
He made the comment at about 11.20am on the first day (24 April 2018). We
driving along the Tullamarine Freeway, past the Essendon Fields exit where there
were road works. Mr Marston said that when
we were decelerating down the hill,
as we changed gear, that he thought that the gear change had felt a bit 'rough'.
I responded
that I did not notice anything, but that I would do it again. I then
slowed down twice to allow the transmission to change down gear
as we drove
along, decelerating and accelerating as we were going past the DFO on our left.
We then both said that we didn't notice
any rough gear changes. The gear changes
were normal both when decelerating and accelerating.
Mr Marston did make a comment later on about there being a 'fluid noise' from
the transmission. In response I said to Mr Marston
that I did not think the
transmission was making any noise that I considered to be 'non-commercial'. I
did not hear any fluid noise
at all from the transmission during my
inspection.
566 He was not challenged about this recollection. But it is consistent with
another part of Mr Marston’s notes where it is
recorded after the
reference to the rough changing down of gears that ‘
’. Mr Marston denied under cross-examination that this was a
reference to Mr Carter re-doing the test but claimed instead at
that it meant that ‘in the continuation of the drive, I didn’t note
that happened – I didn’t note
that issue again’. I do not
accept this evidence. It is inconsistent with the note and
Mr Carter’s evidence. Further,
Mr Marston’s evidence
himself as Ms Capic’s
advocate. I will return to the significance of
this observation later.
567 I therefore do not think that the vehicle exhibited the rough changing of
gears referred to in Mr Marston’s notes. The
topic of rough gear
changes was discussed between them and re-examined carefully after which they
both agreed rough changing of gears
was not present. Insofar as the fluid noise
is concerned, I accept that Mr Marston thought he heard a fluid noise but I
also accept
Mr Carter’s evidence that no noise came out of the
gearbox which was ‘non-commercial’, that is to say, not the
kind of noise which gearboxes make. In any event, a fluid noise (cf gear
rattling) is not amongst the catalogue of problems
put forward by the
568 This brings me more generally to the issue of the reliability of
Mr Marston’s evidence. The Respondent raises several matters
it said would justify the Court in concluding that Mr Marston’s
evidence should be approached with caution. These were:
The IDS episode
569 The Applicant took
her vehicle to be serviced at Jefferson Ford on 24 May 2018. Mr Marston
accompanied her on this occasion.
The question which arises is whether
Mr Marston did, or did not, instruct the dealer not to connect the
Respondent’s IDS equipment
to the Applicant’s vehicle. In itself,
whether he did so or not is not strikingly relevant to any significant issue in
proceeding but the answers given by Mr Marston about this topic led to
a substantial submission that Mr Marston’s evidence
unreliable.
570 To be fair to Mr Marston it is necessary to give a little background
to the issue. The IDS is a computer system which Ford dealers
plug into a
vehicle. Relevantly here it performs two functions. First, it gives the
mechanic working on the vehicle access to diagnostic
data which the on-board
computer system has collected from the vehicle since the last service event.
Secondly, it permits software
updates to be loaded into the vehicle’s
computer control system.
571 When Mr Marston was retained by the Applicant’s then
solicitors on 23 April 2018 he was instructed to accompany Mr Carter
inspections of the vehicle. He was also instructed to ensure that the vehicle
was not tampered with or altered beyond the
reasonable course of inspection
during these inspections. Following Mr Carter’s testing procedures
Mr Marston reported back
to the solicitors by email dated 6 May 2018. This
email shows that Mr Marston understood that this instruction did not
prevent computer
systems being connected to the vehicle so long as they were
‘passive’ and did not bring about any ‘changes to the
parameters’.
572 Although Mr Marston’s written retainer did not require him to
attend when the Applicant next presented her car for routine
servicing it
appears that, by whatever means, the retainer had expanded to include that role.
This service visit took place on 24
May 2018 when Ms Capic took the vehicle
to Jefferson Ford accompanied by Mr Marston. In her 22 November 2019
affidavit Ms Capic
explained that when she took the vehicle for servicing
she did ‘not agree to let Jefferson Ford connect my vehicle to its testing
systems’. This suggests that the instruction not to connect the IDS to
the vehicle came from Ms Capic.
573 There are documents which bear upon this issue. Mr Marston’s
attendance at the vehicle’s servicing at Jefferson Ford
created some
tension on the workshop floor and initially the service manager would not permit
the service to be performed with Mr
Marston hovering in the background.
More senior personnel at Jefferson Ford were then summoned and ultimately
Mr Marston was permitted
to watch the servicing of the vehicle (although
only from behind a glass screen). This background information suggests that,
the Jefferson Ford mechanic’s perspective, the servicing of
Ms Capic’s vehicle might have been a somewhat tenser affair
574 Consistently with Ms Capic’s evidence that she did not permit
the IDS to be connected to the vehicle there is a note in
Jefferson Ford’s
service records which records that wish:
‘-COULD CARRY OUT SLIP RATE TEST DUE TO CUSTOMER
NOT WISHING US TO CONNECT OUR IDS TO THE VEHICLE’
575 (Both parties accepted at trial that the word ‘NOT’ is
missing from this entry and that it should be read as ‘COULD
OUT...’.) It is apparent from what Mr Marston understood from his
instructions that he had no reason to prevent
the IDS being connected to the
vehicle to perform the 250 rpm test but he did have a reason to prevent any
updating of the software.
Mr Marston had been present during
Mr Carter’s tests a month prior when the vehicle had been twice
connected to the IDS and
had raised no objection to this process other than as
to the updating of software. There is no rational reason why Mr Marston
suggest that the vehicle should not be connected to the IDS and, by
contrast, there are sensible reasons why he might say that its
software ought
not to be updated.
576 Consequently, I do not think Mr Marston would have told the mechanic
at the service visit on 24 May 2018 not to connect the IDS.
The only thing he
is likely to have said would have been that there should be no software changes
to the vehicle. I therefore accept
Ms Capic’s evidence that she gave
the instruction not to connect the vehicle to the IDS and I conclude that
Mr Marston did
not say this.
577 Mr Marston’s notes for the service visit record ‘
IDS to be used
’. This entry appears in his notes for 24 May 2018 just
after 10 am when he and Ms Capic first arrived at Jefferson Ford.
infer that it is a note by Mr Marston of Ms Capic’s instruction.
The same notation appears in the notes for later in the
105hrs. No IDS F&R brakes and skim discs. R&R 4 tyres. Fit recall
hose to tank for fuel
’. I incline to the view that this is
Mr Marston recording the facts which had been stated to him by Jefferson
Ford, that is
to say, confirming that the IDS had not been connected.
578 Mr Marston was cross-examined to suggest that it was he who had
instructed that the IDS not be connected. The cross-examination
began by taking
Mr Marston to the Jefferson Ford service record which recorded that the
had given an instruction not to connect the IDS. At T901
Mr Marston denied that he had given such an instruction and said that his
only concern was to prevent software updates. That answer is consistent with
the evidence I have just described. Mr Marston was
not the customer; that
was Ms Capic. Mr Marston was unable to recall whether the IDS was
connected or not but this hardly seems
surprising given the triviality of the
579 The Respondent focussed on two of Mr Marston’s answers during
the cross-examination which it said discredited him. First
the Respondent
criticised Mr Marston for maintaining his denial that he had instructed
Jefferson Ford not to connect the IDS ‘even
in the face of his own
contemporaneous notes’ which recorded ‘
No IDS to be
’. I do not consider this was a fair criticism of
Mr Marston. The Jefferson Ford service record suggested that it was
who had said this not Mr Marston and this was strongly
corroborated by Ms Capic’s own evidence. And, as I have noted,
had no reason to direct that the IDS not be connected and indeed
he had previously been present with Mr Carter when it had been.
concern, from which he did not waver, was that the IDS not be used to update the
software. There is therefore nothing
remarkable in Mr Marston continuing
to deny that he had instructed that the IDS not be connected in the face of his
notes. He did
not give such a direction and his notes do not say that he did.
The cross-examination proceeded on a false assumption – contrary
Jefferson Ford document, Ms Capic’s evidence and
Mr Marston’s evidence – that it was Mr Marston who had
given this direction.
580 Next the Respondent described some of Mr Marston’s evidence
See, you’ve written:
No IDS to be used.
Isn’t that the instruction you gave the Ford dealer?---That is a brief
note of – of mine that says – so my understanding
of that note is I
instructed the guys to say they could not make any software adjustments, as I
had previously mentioned.
Are you serious, Mr Marston?---Absolutely.
581 In fact, I do not think Mr Marston’s notes record his
instructions to Jefferson Ford not to change the software. While
I do not doubt
that Mr Marston recalled saying that – it was the one thing he was
clear on – the note is not about that.
Consequently, there is an element
of confusion in this evidence. That confusion is the joint result of the
cross-examiner’s
incorrect assumption that the note recorded instructions
given by Mr Marston rather than Ms Capic and Mr Marston’s
acceptance of that assumption and his subsequent attempt to reconcile
it with his own recollection. I do not think this evidence
‘incredible’. I think it was confused but no more.
582 Nor do I accept the Respondent’s submission that another answer
Mr Marston gave on this topic was ‘implausible’.
The relevant
evidence is at T904.41-905.30:
Yes. And I’m interested in the next
?---Yes. So no IDS, front and rear brakes, skim discs
and tyres. Correct. Yes. So that note, to me, says they made no changes with
IDS and they - - -
Yes?--- - - - repaired the brakes.
And I suggest to you, again, that your note:
means that you directed the Ford dealer, as the service
record says, not to connect the IDS?---That would be unreasonable, because
of carrying out that service is to check the fault codes.
I suggest – just answer my question, Mr Marston?---Mmm.
I suggest to you that that note corroborates what the service record shows, what
your previous note shows, that you told them, “Do
not connect the
IDS.” What do you say - - -?---That’s - - -
- - - to that?---That’s incorrect. I told them not - - -
And I suggest - - -?--- - - - to make any software adjustments.
Yes. And I suggest that that answer also is untrue. What do you say to
that?---Unfortunately, I – whilst I accept you can say
that, that is not
Well, you’re not lying, are you?---No, I’m not lying.
Would you like to say you are not lying?---I am not lying.
- - - this IDS issue?---About the IDS issue. Absolutely.
583 I do not think this evidence was implausible.
584 Accordingly, I find that (a) Ms Capic instructed Jefferson Ford not
to connect the IDS; (b) if Mr Marston said anything on this
topic it was
only that they should not update the software; (c) that his notes that the IDS
was not connected reflected only Ms Capic’s
instruction. In short, I
do not think that this determined attack on Mr Marston’s credit
The absence of reported problems in Mr Marston’s
585 After his test drive
with Mr Carter, the Applicant’s solicitors asked Mr Marston by
email dated 3 May 2018 to ‘provide
us with an email summary of the
inspection and anything notable that occurred during the week’. He
responded by email dated
6 May 2018. That response referred to the fact that
Mr Carter ‘had video recording equipment in the vehicle’ but
no reference to any difficulties Mr Marston had observed with the
vehicle. There was no reference, for example, to the fluid noise
or rough gear
changing he gave evidence about at the trial. This is not to suggest that he
did not genuinely observe those in his
own mind when he made the notes, but it
does support the idea that whatever they were he did not regard them as a
sufficient problem
to report to the Applicant’s solicitors.
Driving conditions debate
586 The next debate
concerned Mr Marston’s criticism that Mr Carter had not driven
the vehicle in peak hour traffic or stop–start
traffic and had not
sufficiently stressed the gearbox. This evidence was given in re-examination at
T942.25-40. He thought that
there had been ‘no severe driving....just a
gentle drive through the city and through the country’. In his affidavit
of 13 July 2020 Mr Carter responded to this evidence as follows
at §10 and §11:
We did drive in stop/start traffic. I refer to the route
set out on page 5 of my First report. I recall there was stop/start traffic
various parts of the route, including:
(a) on sections of Burke Road;
(b) on Flemington Road;
(c) around Carlton and in particular along Johnston Street;
(d) on Acland St while we were getting out of St Kilda , which was during peak
hour in the late afternoon; and
(e) at the end of the day, coming back along Dandenong Road, then onto
Wattletree Road and turning onto and along Tooronga Road,
all in congested
I also carried out aggressive and severe driving. I accelerated sharply on
several occasions, including on the Tullamarine Freeway.
Numerous times I
accelerated the car on full throttle. For example, I did an aggressive
acceleration on Prospect Hill Road in Camberwell
from the roundabout, as well as
when we were turning right from Belmore Road into Balwyn Road. I also applied
light, medium and hard
throttle. I also did a lot of starting on, and
accelerating on, hills, such as around Balwyn. The hills were at a gradient of 3
4 degrees. It is incorrect to describe the road test as a "gentle
587 Mr Carter was not challenged about this evidence although the
Applicant submitted at [535] that Mr Carter’s evidence was
detail. This part of it does not appear to be light on detail to me. It is
also consistent with the testing methodology
outlined in Mr Carter’s
first report where he said that the point of the exercise had been to test the
vehicle in a variety
of circumstances. (‘The route chosen for the test
drive was designed to expose the vehicle to a wide variety of circumstances
driving conditions which would normally be encountered in Melbourne and its
surrounding suburbs’: p 5.) In the end the
Applicant submitted that
Mr Marston’s notes showed that the testing had started after
10.40 am and finished by 4.33 pm so that
the test conditions had
missed most of peak hour. I do not think, however, that this is an answer to
Mr Carter’s evidence.
Mr Marston’s subsequent testing
588 This brings me at
length to that aspect of Mr Marston’s evidence which is most
controversial. It will be recalled that
Mr Marston had accompanied
Ms Capic for the service of her car on 24 May 2018. As it happens the
vehicle remained with Jefferson
Ford until the next day when
Mr Marston’s notes suggest that he picked it up at 2.08 pm. It
would appear he took it for a
test drive by himself. Mr Marston’s
notes for 25 May 2018 record this:
At 2.08 advised vehicle was ready for customer. So I
carried out a road test alone. The vehicle displayed some braking issues, noise
and shudder from front RHS. Took vehicle to workshop and spoke to service person
Harry who got William Tech to road test with me.
He noted brake issues too and
took vehicle back to workshop, stripped RHF brakes and remachined and
reassembled.
I then re road tested brakes OK.
However on road test vehicle displayed:
- erratic gear change
- lost power from standing start
- hunting between gears
- lag from take off
- vehicle held acceleration when foot taken off throttle at 60kms
- when vehicle cold hard to select gear.
589 Nothing is to be made of the fact that this was not mentioned in his
report to the solicitors on 6 May 2018 because it occurred
on 25 May 2018, some
weeks later. Mr Marston himself does not appear to have done anything
immediately with these observations.
On 25 July 2018 he sent an email to the
solicitors referring to the servicing on 24 and 25 May 2018. In the email he
The reason for me mentioning this; To confirm the
vehicle had been correctly repaired I had to carry out an extended road test.
that test I personally noted some vehicle abnormalities which Ms Capic
had advised us of, but I had previously not personally experienced.
I wonder if
this is relevant and possibly merits a quick conversation.
Separately, if it is appropriate and if you have received a copy of their
experts CarTech report I would appreciate a copy of it.
Obviously, I am happy to
comment on it formally if you wanted me to, however, for my own learning and
understanding I would appreciate
a chance to view it.
590 The Applicant submits that Mr Marston’s notes of his test
drive on 25 May 2018 are evidence that the Applicant’s vehicle
to experience shudder even after her clutch and seals were replaced. However,
the notes do not refer to shudder as one
of the issues he encountered and I do
not think they are evidence about that. On the other hand, they are evidence
that on 25 May
2018 whilst Mr Marston was testing the brakes on his own the
vehicle displayed each of the six problems recorded in his notes.
591 The Respondent submitted the circumstances in which Mr Marston had
done this testing was unknown and hence this evidence could
be given little
weight. I do not think this criticism has great force. The vehicle should not
display these behaviours in any ordinary
circumstance. If the roles were
reversed and it was Mr Carter who had done a solitary test which revealed
no symptoms then the submission
would be forceful. Because the problem is
intermittent unless one had known what Mr Carter had done with the vehicle,
then the fact
that no problem was found would be of little weight. But the
internal logic of this is not the same when the intermittent problem
occur during Mr Marston’s testing. It seems likely that
Mr Marston was testing the brakes when these events occurred
that is what his notes suggest).
592 This point may be pursued. There are two ways Mr Marston may have
driven the vehicle, in an ordinary way or, instead (as Dr Greiner
put it) in a
‘spirited’ fashion. If the vehicle was driven calmly then
occurrence of the intermittent problem shows
that it occurs in that driving
condition. If the vehicle was being driven con brio and the intermittent
problem occurred this shows
that the problem occurred during that driving
condition. But neither conclusion leads to the outcome that
Mr Marston’s observations
are unreliable.
593 I have wondered whether the reliability of Mr Marston’s notes
may be impacted by other matters. I have rejected the attacks
on his credit
detailed above so those matters may be disregarded. I do not accept, as was
suggested in the Respondent’s closing
address, that what he observed on 25
May 2018 might be put down to an attempt on his part to solicit work from the
Applicant’s
lawyers: cf T1643.1ff. The logic of the submission entails
Mr Marston making up symptoms for the purpose of garnering further work
then permitting his notes to go forward knowing them to be false but attached to
an affidavit sworn by him to be true. That
would be a grave matter and I would
hesitate to find it unless it was clearly established. Moreover, it was not put
to Mr Marston
that his notes of 25 May 2018 were false so that even if
I were minded to make such a finding – which I am not – there
be insuperable procedural roadblocks to reasoning in that fashion. To the same
end, whilst I am usually quite sceptical of
the value of general assessments of
credit disconnected from analysis of evidence, I am bound to say that
Mr Marston did not strike
me as the kind of person who would behave in that
way. I have earlier observed that I think Mr Marston may have regarded
as being in Ms Capic’s corner and to have tailored his
evidence to assist her when presented with the opportunity. But there
large gulf between advocacy and dishonesty and I do not think Mr Marston
lies on the dishonest side of the line.
594 Consequently, I do not accept the invitation concealed within the
Respondent’s incomplete submission that the symptoms Mr
Marston noted
bore some similarity to the ones about which Ms Capic had complained to
him. It was an incomplete submission because
it omitted its final step which
was the unstated suggestion that Mr Marston was Ms Capic’s
advocate and was simply repeating
her evidence as his own. I do not think that
Mr Marston’s advocacy can be said to go that far.
Did the Applicant challenge Mr Carter’s
595 The Applicant
submitted at [106] that she did not challenge ‘any of
Mr Carter’s evidence that he personally did not
experience any of
these defects during his 2018 test drive’ and she does not challenge his
conclusions about the 2020 test
drive. Indeed, the Applicant submitted that I
should accept Mr Carter’s evidence because it was not inconsistent
with Ms Capic’s.
She explicitly said that she did not challenge
Mr Carter’s evidence that he did not experience the issues which
Ms Capic describes
in her affidavits. The Applicant went out of her way at
[106] to submit that she also accepted Mr Carter’s evidence about
‘minor vehicle shake’ and ‘minor noise at
100 km/h’. In indicating her acceptance of this evidence (which
in her favour and therefore not much of a concession) the Applicant omitted from
the quote Mr Carter’s evidence in the very
same passage that these
problems could be associated with not using premium grade fuel and that the
shake was only present when the
engine was cold (neither of which, but
particularly the first, is in her favour at all).
596 However, at [107] and also at [531]-[535] the Applicant explained why
Mr Carter’s evidence did not matter. First, insofar
as he suggested
that the problems were caused by driving with the left foot resting on the brake
pedal she submitted that the evidence
was that she did not do so. Ms Capic
did accept at T309 that very occasionally she did drive the vehicle with her
left foot on the
brake but this was only in very limited circumstances. After
the delivery of Mr Carter’s second report with its suggestion
foot braking Ms Capic had affirmed her final affidavit (of 5 May 2020)
in which she addressed this topic squarely at §§12-14.
There is no
need to set this out. In essence she confessed – I am not sure that is
really the right word – that she
did put her left foot on the brake when
she was parked on a steep hill. She said that she did this very rarely.
Ms Capic was cross-examined
at T309 about this practice but not in a way
that qualifies or alters this evidence. For the reasons I give in
Section V I accept
that Ms Capic was basically an honest witness
although when put under pressure in the witness box she could find herself
saying something
perhaps not entirely true in the heat of the moment. Her
denial that she is a left foot brake driver is one I therefore accept and
not think that the fact that occasionally she sneaks her left foot on the brake
when parked on a steep hill means that she should
be characterised in that way
either. The difficulties Mr Carter described as arising from the deviant
practice of left foot brake
driving would not occur in the very limited
circumstances in which Ms Capic took this walk on the wild side. In that
circumstance,
whilst I do not reject Mr Carter’s theory that left
foot braking could be a cause of the problems I conclude that that theory
application to the Applicant because that is not, in fact, how she drives her
car. In that circumstance, the Respondent accepted
that there was no need to
inquire further into the admittedly curious fact that the Applicant’s
former lawyers instructed Mr
Marston not to investigate the phenomenon of
left foot braking: T1683.33.
597 Secondly, the Applicant submitted that Mr Carter’s evidence
was not inconsistent with the fact that the Applicant’s
car had been
produced with each of the Component Deficiencies. This was because he only
examined the vehicle after the TCM, input
shaft seals and the B8080 clutch had
been replaced. Furthermore, the matters which Mr Carter did note –
minor vehicle shake
and minor noise at 100 km/h – are consistent with
the existence of torsional vibrations passing through the drivetrain. The
Respondent accepts that a slight shudder at low speeds, gear rattle, shunting
and harsh gear changes could occur with the DPS6 independently
of the three
Component Deficiencies I have found to be proven. I have found that the first
two of these issues were the result of
torsional vibrations being transmitted
through the drivetrain as a consequence of not being completely damped by the
use of inner
dampers and clutch slip. I conclude that what Mr Carter
observed were manifestations of this issue.
598 Having submitted that the Court should accept Mr Carter’s
evidence and having explained why the evidence did not matter,
Applicant’s submissions then subsequently struck out in a new direction by
developing an elaborate attack on Mr Carter’s
credit at [109]-[115].
It is hard to know how to reconcile the Applicant’s various submissions on
this topic. Out of respect
to Mr Carter, however, I will just record that
I reject these challenges to his credit. I do not think that the fact that
was aware of the issues with the DPS6 before the preparation of
his reports signifies anything apart from the fact that as a professional
automotive engineer he does not live under a rock. I do not think, in that
circumstance, that his failure to refer to that previous
experience reflects
anything of moment. Nor do I think that it is especially to the point that he
had done previous work on a DPS6
equipped vehicle for the Respondent in 2012.
The suggestion that it was improper for him to test his left foot braking thesis
the Applicant’s car without first getting permission of the Applicant
was, in my view, one of many sideshows with which this
litigation has been beset
as was the criticism of his summary of the dealer invoices. Finally, whilst I
accept that Mr Carter was
not a transmission engineer, that does not
entail, as the Applicant effectively submitted that it did, that his conclusions
be thrown in the forensic trash can (whilst inviting me in an earlier
paragraph to accept everything he said). When all is said
Mr Carter is a mechanical engineer with 35 years’ experience working
with motor vehicles. It is not as if the Respondent
had called a pastry chef to
testify about Ms Capic’s vehicle.
Conclusions on Mr Carter’s and
Mr Marston’s evidence
599 I find that
Mr Carter’s testing procedure was rigorous and methodologically
sound. During the 2018 test neither he nor
Mr Marston observed any
difficulties with the transmission or the engine. I accept
Mr Carter’s evidence that the vehicle was
in good working order and
that none of the problems it is alleged to suffer from became manifest during
his tests in 2018. I also
accept that none of these problems became manifest
during the 2020 test apart from a slight shudder and minor noise. I accept that
the vehicle returned a result of 50 rpm on the IDS test in 2020 but I do
not think this has any significance.
600 I also accept that the vehicle displayed the 6 matters referred to in
Mr Marston’s notes on 25 May 2018. These do not include
shudder. I have accepted Ms Capic’s evidence that the vehicle
continued to display symptoms after the TCM, clutch and input
shaft seals were
replaced. It would have been open to me not to have accepted her evidence about
this. The evidence before the
Court could have justified the conclusion that
Ms Capic did not tell the truth about the answer she gave in the finance
that she was, perhaps, prone to exaggeration when it came to her car
(as evidenced by her Facebook Messenger message). Both of those
matters could
have justified the rejection of her evidence that the vehicle continued to
display symptoms after the replacement of
the TCM, clutch and the input shaft
601 However, as I have explained, I feel uncomfortable with the idea that she
made this evidence up and such a conclusion is not consistent
with my basic
assessment of her as an honest witness. Further, as I have explained, the
clutch replacement Ms Capic’s Focus
received was not the RCF1o lined
clutch but instead the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch. The Respondent did not
demonstrate that
this material did in fact resolve the problems which B8080 had
presented. On the engineering evidence it is therefore possible that
Ms Capic’s vehicle did continue to display problems (noting too that
the Applicant did not prove that the half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch was not
effective). Had her vehicle received the RCF1o material the matter would have
been much more problematic –
perhaps insolubly so ‑– because
in that circumstance there could be no mechanical explanation for the behaviour.
where the efficacy of the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch has not been
proven that problem does not arise.
602 I mention these matters again at the risk of repetition because they
impact on Mr Marston’s evidence in the same way. I
have resolved
them the same way. Finally, the evidence of Ms Capic and Mr Marston
corroborate each other. It is relevant to observe
that (a) it is less likely
that they are both lying about this matter; and, (b) if either is telling the
truth about what they experienced,
this makes it much more likely that the other
is telling the truth. I make these comments to indicate that in reaching the
conclusions
I have about Ms Capic and Mr Marston on this topic I have
considered the way in which each witness’s evidence relates to the
SECTION XII: ACCEPTABLE QUALITY
603 This issue is
governed by ACL
-(3) which provide:
54 Guarantee as to acceptable quality
(a) a person supplies, in trade or commerce,
goods to a consumer; and
(b) the supply does not occur by way of sale by auction;
there is a guarantee that the goods are of acceptable quality.
(2) Goods are of
acceptable quality
they are as:
(a) fit for all the purposes for which goods
of that kind are commonly supplied; and
(b) acceptable in appearance and finish; and
(c) free from defects; and
(d) safe; and
(e) durable;
as a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the state and condition of the
goods (including any hidden defects of the goods),
would regard as acceptable
having regard to the matters in subsection (3).
(3) The matters for the purposes of subsection (2)
(a) the nature of the goods; and
(b) the price of the goods (if relevant); and
(c) any statements made about the goods or any packaging or label on the goods;
(d) any representation made about the goods by the supplier or manufacturer of
the goods; and
(e) any other relevant circumstances relating to the supply of the goods.
avoids saying who provides the guarantee. To take it at face
value it would appear to imply the existence of a legal right in the
under the guarantee without specifying the identity of the person with the
corresponding obligation. However, this initial
impression is incorrect. Some
two hundred pages later in the ACL, s 271 provides an action in damages
against the manufacturer of
the goods where the guarantee is breached. Section
271(1) provides:
271 Action for damages against manufacturer of
(a) the guarantee under
to a supply of goods to a consumer; and
(b) the guarantee is not complied with;
an affected person in relation to the goods may, by action against the
manufacturer of the goods, recover damages from the manufacturer.
605 This provision is about manufacturers. Of course, the Respondent did not
manufacture any of the vehicles. But this does not
matter because
‘manufacturer’ does not mean ‘manufacturer’ in this
case. Any person who had read ACL
would know this because it defines
‘manufacturer’ to include a person who imports goods into Australia
where that person
is not the manufacturer and at the time of the importation the
manufacturer does not have a place of business in Australia. The
these provisions is that where a person imports goods into Australia there is a
guarantee that the goods are of acceptable
606 As I will later explain, while Ms Capic is a person who may make a
claim for reduction in value damages under s 271(1), that proposition
complicated in respect of the other members of the group. The reasons for and
consequences of this remain to be considered
but, for present purposes, the
issue is whether the vehicles were of ‘acceptable quality’ within
the meaning of
The language of
suggests that the
guarantee applies at the time of supply of vehicles. The issue is therefore
whether the vehicles were of acceptable
quality at the time of supply.
607 ‘Acceptable quality’ is defined in
, extracted
above. The relevant portions of this are the requirement that the vehicles be
fit for all purposes for which such vehicles
are commonly supplied, be free from
defects, be safe and be durable. In deciding whether the vehicles satisfied
those requirements
one is required by
to have regard ‘to the
matters in subsection (3)’, also extracted above.
608 The Applicant’s case took as its starting point that the vehicles
fitted with the DPS6 had various risks of failure. The
Applicant contended that
goods with a risk of failure would not be of acceptable quality. She relied on
this Court’s decision
Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd
[2003] FCA 36
126 FCR 219
’). In that case it was found that
Mr Courtney was entitled to recover damages for the pain, suffering, loss
of enjoyment of
life and economic loss associated with having removed from his
chest cavity a particular kind of sub-optimal pacemaker. The pacemaker
utilised ‘yellow spool solder’ which is bad. The use of yellow
spool solder was generally attended by a risk
of dendritic failure which is why
Mr Courtney had the pacemaker removed. On inspection of the blighted
pacemaker following its successful
explantation from Mr Courtney it was
ascertained that it had always functioned normally and, indeed, had it not been
explanted it
would probably not have failed prematurely. The risk with the
yellow-spool solder, though real, would likely never have eventuated
Mr Courtney’s case. With hindsight one could say that the
explantation had been unnecessary. Indeed, this is precisely
manufacturer did say in resisting Mr Courtney’s claim.
609 The trial judge, Sackville J, understandably rejected this
unattractive submission. He concluded that the pacemaker was not of
merchantable quality because it had a superadded risk of failure, that is, a
superadded risk that it would be unable to fulfil the
purpose of restoring or
maintaining the heart rate of patients experiencing electrical heart-related
[224]. It was not to the point that in the individual
case the risk might not have transpired. The Full Court upheld the trial
conclusions:
Medtel v Courtney
[2003] FCAFC 151
Branson J with whom Jacobson J agreed observed at [78]:
In my view, having regard to the evidence before the
primary judge ... no error can be shown to have been involved in his
conclusion that a pacemaker that has only the ordinary or usual
risk of premature failure is more fit for the purpose of being used
pacemaker than a pacemaker that has, by reason of the method of its manufacture,
an appreciably higher risk of premature failure.
In this case it was reasonable
to expect, at the time of the supply to Mr Courtney of his pacemaker, that Mr
Courtney’s pacemaker
had been manufactured in a way which gave rise to
only the ordinary or usual risk of premature failure. However, the use of yellow
spool solder in the manufacture of Mr Courtney’s pacemaker meant that Mr
Courtney’s pacemaker had an appreciably higher
risk of premature failure
than the ordinary or usual risk of premature failure to be expected in
pacemakers.
610 This reasoning has been applied to other goods with an inherent risk
which renders them not of acceptable quality: eg, components
in satellite
broadband devices in
APS Satellite Pty Ltd (formerly known as “SkyMesh
Pty Ltd”) v Ipstar Australia Pty Ltd
[2016] NSWSC 1898
’) at [69]-[82] per Rein J (while the case was not on
all fours with
, his Honour recognised the reasoning in
as an authoritative approach to ‘prone to failure’ cases); high
density polyethelene containment liner in
Protec Pacific Pty Ltd v Steuler
Services GmbH & Co KG
[2014] VSCA 338
Santamaria and Kyrou JJA (although the claim failed); and, ocean going
recreational fishing vessels in
Vautin v BY Winddown, Inc. (formerly Bertram
Yachts) (No 4)
[2018] FCA 426
362 ALR 702
at [145]-[151] per Derrington J.
611 The Respondent submitted that
was distinguishable because a
pacemaker was a non-discretionary good upon which a consumer’s life might
depend. There was
no comparison to be made between the nature of a pacemaker
and the nature of a vehicle or between the potential for a pacemaker to
the potential for a vehicle to exhibit non-safety related issues. Further,
there was no way the pacemaker in Mr Courtney’s
chest could have been
checked for yellow spool solder; explantation was the only reasonable course
612 I accept that not every inherent risk of failure will have the
consequence that goods are not of acceptable quality. The conclusion
particular case will be a function of the nature of the feared failure and the
extent of the risk of its occurrence, measured
against the consumer’s
reasonable expectations of how the product ought to behave. Sometimes the
failure will be trivial or
the risk insubstantial and in such cases the claim
may fail. Further than this, at least in principle, seems dangerous to go.
613 Plainly enough the risk in
was a very serious risk from
Mr Courtney’s perspective but I do not read the case as stipulating
that inherent risk claims
are confined to those where the risk is
life-threatening or of some similar ominous standard separate from the standard
in the statutory questions embodied in
itself: the
consumer’s reasonable expectations of the fitness for purpose, appearance,
lack of defects, safety and durability
of the product in question (see
at [224] per Sackville J). In
APS Satellite
the risk was that the
satellite kit was prone to leak which is hardly the stuff of drama. In
the way in which the vessel had been constructed exposed its hull
to a risk of delamination in heavy seas. These perils are not of
the genre to
which the Respondent seeks to confine the
principle. I conclude
that the principle is not so confined.
The matters in
614 It is therefore
necessary to consider whether each of the inherent risks of failure I have
concluded existed were such as to mean
that the vehicles were not of acceptable
quality. However, that assessment is required by
to be conducted
having regard to the matters in
which are therefore mandatory
matters which the Court must assess. Dealing with each in turn:
Section 54(3)(a):
the nature of the goods
615 Each of the vehicles
was a B- or C-segment vehicle. B- and C-segment motor vehicles are at the
cheaper end of the market, or
as the Respondent put it, ‘they are
economical entry-level vehicles’. The uses to which they would commonly
be put would
be for passenger transportation. They are likely to be used in
traffic conditions of all kinds which would include driving in heavy
light traffic, on good roads and on bad. They are also likely to be driven in a
range of manners ranging from sedately
to vigorously.
Section 54(3)(b):
the price of the goods (if
616 The Applicant did
not make any submission about the effect (if any) of the actual prices of the
Affected Vehicles on the analysis
, beyond noting they were
priced competitively with other new vehicles in their segment of the market.
However, as part of his expert
evidence on the question of excess depreciation
Mr Stockton was provided with a spreadsheet of the Respondent’s
recommended
list prices for roughly 90% of all types of Affected Vehicle.
Resort to this document shows that there are 18 distinct prices involved.
fluctuate according to model line, year, engine size, and badge. The Focus
across the period ranged in price from $22,590
to $33,840, the Fiesta from
$17,490 to $22,525 and the EcoSport from $22,790 to $27,790. In general and
subject to significant variation,
the Focus was more expensive than the EcoSport
which was more expensive than the Fiesta. Whilst these are not expensive cars
purchase prices nevertheless represent amounts that would be a substantial
investment for most people.
Section 54(3)(c):
any statements made about the goods on any
packaging or label on the goods
617 It was not suggested
by either party that there were any such statements which were relevant.
Section 54(3)(d):
any representation made about the goods by
the supplier or manufacturer of the goods
618 This provision does
not in terms require the representation to be made to the consumer and I can see
no warrant for reading it
as if it did. The Applicant submitted that the
vehicles had been marketed as quality motor vehicles with a new DPS6
transmission
that was ‘sealed for life’, ‘low
maintenance’, with ‘smooth gear changes’ and offering
convenience of an automatic’ with the performance of a manual.
However, the Applicant’s analysis of the evidence pertinent
dealt only with ‘smooth gear changes’, ‘the
power or responsiveness of a manual with the benefits and ease of an
automatic’ and ‘sealed for life’.
619 The evidence for each key message was as follows:
It was an automatic transmission with smooth gear
620 The evidence for
this was said to be T547.26-36, T548.5, T550.44 and T635.40-43. The first three
references are from the cross-examination
of Mr Karageorgiou. The first
three references appear to be in error because they do not refer to any
representation about smooth
gear changes. However, it seems the Applicant is
working off an earlier version of the transcript for this day of the trial which
was subsequently reissued by the transcript provider and the pagination shifted
by one page. Making that assumption the first three
references should instead
be T546.26-36, T547.5 and T549.44. These are from the cross-examination of
Mr Karageorgiou and read as
And then it says:
PowerShift technology. Thanks to the
latest PowerShift technology, when you’re driving the Fiesta it’s
like having the
best of both worlds – smoother gear changes, with
excellent fuel efficiency.
All right. That was, as you understood it, one of the key marketing messages
that was being put out by Ford in Australia in relation
to these vehicles with
the DPS6 transmission?---Yes.
And that the gear changes would be smooth?---That’s correct
And I want to suggest to you smooth gear changes; correct?---Yes.
621 The context for these answers is that Mr Karageorgiou was being
taken to a document which the transcript identifies as FOR.727.001.1720.
Mr Karageorgiou identified the document as one prepared by the
Respondent’s marketing and sales organisation (of which he
member). At T550.26-T551.1 this exchange occurred:
This sort of a document is then given to dealers, to
provide them with product information in relation to, in this case, the WT
Fiesta?---That
would be a fair statement.
The idea being that dealer staff would then read this material, so that
they’re able to properly market the vehicle?---That
would be expected.
All right. So if we go to 1722 – no, 23 – there’s the
introduction:
So with the introduction of the new WT
model, the award-winning Fiesta range will be poised to further strengthen
Ford’s position
in the light-car market.
Do you see that?---Yes.
All right. So it’s – this is, in effect, introducing to dealers, in
effect, the key attributes of the new WT Fiesta;
correct?---Correct.
And is it consistent with your expectation that a similar document would be
prepared, for example, in relation to the new Focus range
when that was
introduced?---Look, I – I was not part of the marketing and sales
organisation, but I would expect that to be
All right. And similarly in relation to the EcoSport; correct?---Correct.
622 I take the Applicant’s submission to be that (a) a document of this
kind was prepared for all three models for the dealers
to assist them in
marketing the vehicles; (b) the dealers might be expected to make statements
along the lines of what was contained
in the document to customers; so that (c)
it may be inferred that representations to the effect contained in the document
by the dealers about the vehicles (and the DPS6). The
Applicant’s submission did not rely on any part of the document in
case but I assume this was an oversight.
623 The document is entitled ‘WT Fiesta Sales Guide’ and is dated
October 2010. There were a number of pages to which
Mr Karageorgiou
was taken in the cross-examination. The relevant passages are as follows from
All right. So could we go, please, then to page 1727.
Just blow up – that’s fine. Thank you. So this is – I’m
sorry. Can you include the heading, as well, that is just above that. So these
are the Key Product Changes; do you see that?---Yes.
And it’s one of the key product changes, obviously enough, is the
PowerShift transmission; correct?---Correct.
The six speed PowerShift –
I am reading from the document –
automatic transmission is now the only
automatic option on all petrol WT Fiesta models.
Correct?---Yes.
So there’s no longer a conventional automatic with a torque converter
available?---That’s correct.
PowerShift introduces an efficient and
smooth changing dual dry clutch transmission.
Do you see that?---Yes.
Again, a similar marketing message to what we saw in the earlier brochure that I
took you to?---Mmm.
And at the end of the next paragraph:
This leads to less torque interruption
and a more consistent smoother driving experience.
Do you see that?---I do.
All right. And then you’ve got the key competitors. Do you see that in the
table?---I do.
Do you agree that they were the key competitor vehicles of the Ford Fiesta at or
exactly who was in the
market. But, yes, they – they seemed to be the competitors at the
All right. And then, below that:
Compared to the four and five speed
transmissions offered by competitors, the Fiesta’s six speed PowerShift
transmission will
offer more responsive power, seamless gear changes and better
fuel economy.
Do you see that?---I do.
What’s on the screen:
The Fiesta’s automatic option is a
key selling point against competitors and its advantages should be communicated
to any prospective
Correct?---Correct.
So one of the key messages that dealers were being told to dealers were being
told to identify to intending purchaser was the PowerShift
transmission;
correct?---That’s what’s stated on the document.
All right. And that what that transmission offered was an efficient and
smooth-changing transmission; correct?---Correct.
Leading to a more consistent, smoother driving experience?---That’s what
the document says. Yes.
Yes. Nothing about shudder, judder, and the like; correct?---Correct.
624 I accept that the Applicant has proven that the Respondent made
representations in 2010 about the WT Fiesta to the effect that:
(a) the DPS6 introduced an efficient and smooth changing
dry dual clutch transmission;
(b) the DPS6 led to a more consistent smoother driving experience; and
(c) the DPS6 offered seamless gear changes.
625 It is difficult to know what to make of Mr Karageorgiou’s
concession that he would expect there to be equivalent documents
for the Fiesta
and the EcoSport. There are problems of detail with the Applicant’s
approach to this issue. There are six
badges of the Fiesta within the Affected
Vehicle population, only three of which fall within the genus of WT Fiestas, all
being built
between 2010 and 2013. The Applicant did not invite the witness (or
me) to conclude that the document dated October 2010 applied
to some or all
other kinds of Fiestas (eg of the genus ‘WZ’ and built between 2012
and 2016). Nor was the witness or
the Court taken to an equivalent document for
the WZ Fiestas – indeed, the purpose of extracting
Mr Karageorgiou’s concession
seems to have been to avoid such a
626 Mr Karageorgiou gave evidence that his responsibilities as SEO
Manager included developing technical publications and dealer training
vehicles pre-launch, although his primary focus was on post-launch support,
including those aspects of dealer training and general
after-sales care of
vehicles. He also had responsibility for the warranty repair program undertaken
in relation to vehicles fitted
with the DPS6. Mr Karageorgiou was not from the
marketing and sales department. However as SEO manager he reported to the Ford
Customer Service Division (‘FCSD’) General Manger, where the FCSD
was also responsible for ‘Marketing and Sales
(service parts)’.
Whilst I share his view that it was likely that the marketing department had
produced similar sales guides
for other model lines and indeed he was taken to a
similar document in relation to the Focus dated 2011 (to which the Applicant
in her submissions on the misleading and deceptive conduct case,
considered in Section XIII below), I am not especially confident
Mr Karageorgiou’s evidence was sufficient to obviate the need for the
Court to be taken to the other documents. I do
not think I could infer that
everything which appears in this document necessarily appeared in other such
documents. In many ways
the documents will be obviously different if only to
reflect the fact that the vehicles are different. Against that one might say
that the DPS6 was common to all the vehicles so that one might expect that
statements made about it would be the same. However,
the commonsense of this
reduces on close inspection. Across the period Ford US became aware of several
problems with the DPS6.
Is the Court to infer that it did not change the text
of these documents in light of those changes? These matters make it difficult
to conclude that the statements contained in this document are contained in all
other such documents.
627 I am not satisfied that I can find on the basis of this material that for
every type of vehicle in the Affected Vehicle Population
the same statements
were made. It would be a guess aided only by Mr Karageorgiou’s
speculation. This matter could easily
have been proved by a notice to admit
facts or, even, by the tender of all of the documents.
628 Turning then to the Applicant’s reliance on the cross-examination
of Mr Cruse at T635.40-43. This exchange is as follows:
All right. As you understood it, it was being marketed
by Ford in Australia as an automatic transmission?---Yes, that’s correct.
It’s an automatic transmission.
Offering smooth gear changes with excellent fuel efficiency?---Yes.
629 Given that Mr Cruse occupied the same role that Mr Karageorgiou had
before him, the value of this evidence may perhaps be doubted.
However, the
Respondent in addressing itself to the Applicant’s s 54 case did not
submit that I should not accept it and was
otherwise enthusiastic about Mr
Cruse’s value as a witness. Thin as it is, I accept therefore that this
evidence shows that
the DPS6 was marketed as an automatic transmission with
smooth gear changes.
The DPS6 had the power or responsiveness of a manual with the
benefits and ease of an automatic
630 Here, the Applicant
again relied on the cross-examination of Mr Karageorgiou. Based on the relevant
content of the transcript
I again infer that the intended references were
T547.1-3 and T549.46-550.3. These sections of the transcript are as
Again, as you understood it, that was another one of the
key messages that was being put out by Ford in marketing these vehicles,
that you had responsiveness of a manual with the ease of an automatic;
correct?---That’s correct.
All right. Now – and as you understood it, Mr Karageorgiou, these things
were being marketed as automatic transmission; correct?---That
is correct.
With the ease of an automatic, by which, you understood – in the sense in
which I’ve used it before, namely, that the
driver doesn’t need to
do anything to change gears; correct?---That’s correct.
631 Mr Cruse also accepted that the DPS6 was marketed as having ‘the
power of a manual with the benefits of an automatic’:
T635.45. He did not
refer to the ‘ease’ of an automatic. Whilst this evidence appears a
little thin to me where neither
Mr Karageorgiou or Mr Cruse were
responsible for the preparation of these materials, in circumstances where the
Respondent did not
address itself to the issue in the context of the
case, I propose to act upon it.
The DPS6 was ‘sealed for life’
632 Again, on the basis
of Mr Cruse’s evidence at T636.1-2, I accept that the DPS6 was marketed in
this fashion, which the Applicant
suggested meant that it was a low maintenance
component part.
Conclusion on
representations
633 I do not think that
the statement that the DPS6 had the ‘benefits of an automatic’ goes
very far in this case. What
were the benefits? One’s initial reaction
would be that the principal benefit is not having to change the gears or operate
a clutch. It is not in dispute that the DPS6 did not require drivers to do
either. As to it having the ‘power or responsiveness
of a manual’,
given that the central issues arising from the proven Component Deficiencies or
inadequate torsional damping
did not correspond to a lack of power or
responsiveness vis-a-vis a manual transmission, I have only had limited regard
to this representation.
634 Nor do I think that ‘sealed for life’ goes very far either.
As I understood it, the Applicant’s point about
this was that the phrase
implied that the transmission would not need to be opened up and repaired on a
frequent basis and/or that
it would be generally low maintenance. I do not
think that is very persuasive; among other matters, there is no suggestion that
the transmissions became ‘unsealed’ (whatever that would entail) and
I am not convinced that the phrase ‘sealed
for life’ would itself
reasonably be understood to mean or imply that the transmission was low
maintenance.
635 That said, I do accept that the statement that the DPS6 had ‘smooth
gear changes’ is pertinent to the resolution of
the question whether the
Affected Vehicles were of acceptable quality.
Section 54(3)(e):
any other relevant circumstances relating
to the supply of the goods
636 Neither party
explicitly took me to this provision in the context of any facts. However, one
submission made by the Respondent
would appear to fall within it. This is the
fact that vehicles are sold with warranties and regularly serviced. It is a
life that motor vehicles do develop problems and require repair. Whilst
one does not take one’s kettle in for a service after
5,000 cups of tea
(or one class action judgment) it is an ordinary incident of car ownership to
have the car serviced and its problems
rectified under warranty. The limits of
this observation should be noted. It does not mean, for example, that motor
vehicles cannot
be other than of acceptable quality. It is a question of
637 Having surveyed the mandatory matters in
necessary to consider each of the problems which have been identified.
Vehicles with original input shaft seals
638 I have concluded
that vehicles which were supplied with the original input shaft seals had a real
risk that the seals would leak
and thereby permit lubricants to travel to the
clutch plates. When this occurred it would cause the clutch to behave
unpredictably.
When this occurred a range of symptoms could ensue. These were
intermittent and included difficulties with gear selection, sudden
deceleration,
shudder, grinding noises, the appearance of the check engine light, slower
response times and rattling.
639 Having regard to the matters set out above, I do not think that vehicles
with this inherent risk can be said to be fit for the
purpose of being driven as
a motor vehicle in ordinary conditions. Such a purpose is one of the purposes
(probably the principal
purpose) for which the vehicles were commonly supplied.
It follows that the vehicles containing the original input shaft seals did
at the time of their supply satisfy
and were accordingly not of
acceptable quality within the meaning of
They also did not comply
(ie they were not free from defects).
640 In reaching that conclusion I have, as I have said, taken into account
each of the matters set out above, ie the
matters. These include
the thin findings in relation to
s 54(3)(d).
Even if I had concluded that
no such representations had been made, I would have reached the same conclusion
on the question under
In my view, it is clear that vehicles
supplied with this proclivity were not of acceptable quality.
641 A currently indeterminate number of vehicles supplied with the original
input shaft seals have had these replaced with seals made
from the FKM elastomer
with a steel outer backing on the inner seal. For present purposes, that does
not impact on the question
of whether the vehicles complied with the
guarantee at the time of their supply. It is, however, relevant to the
Applicant’s claim under ACL s 271 and it is potentially
relevant to
the question of damages. It is not necessary or appropriate to deal with those
issues at this juncture.
Vehicles with B8080
642 I have concluded
that every vehicle supplied with a DPS6 containing clutches which used B8080
lining material had a real risk
that the clutches would behave unpredictably
confusing the TCM and causing the transmission itself to behave unpredictably.
vehicles in the cohort which still contain clutches solely reliant on
B8080 lining this inherent risk continues. As I have explained,
clutches were and are prone to result in shudder, difficulty changing gears,
lack or loss of power, NVH issues and clutch
643 Having regard to the matters set out above, I do not think that vehicles
supplied with the B8080 lining can be said to be fit
for the purpose of being
driven as a motor vehicle
(s 54(2)(a))
or that they were free from defects
(s 54(2)(c)).
Consequently, at the time they were supplied vehicles
containing the B8080 lining were not of acceptable quality.
644 I would have reached the same conclusion even if I had not accepted the
existence of the representations referred to above in
dealing with
s 54(3)(d).
645 A large number of vehicles containing clutches with the B8080 lining have
had them replaced with either an RCF1o clutch or the
half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch. I repeat the remarks I have made about the legal significance of
rectification work above.
646 As for the 256 EcoSports manufactured with the half-hybrid B8040/B8080
clutch, the effect of the conclusions reached in Section
VII is that the
Applicant has not proven that these vehicles were prone to the same difficulties
as those containing B8080. The
Applicant therefore has not proven that these
vehicles were supplied in breach of the
guarantee by reason of their clutch
Vehicles with a TCM containing the original ATIC 91
647 I have concluded
that vehicles which were supplied with a TCM containing an original ATIC 91
chip had a real risk of developing
solder cracks. If the cracks developed the
consequence was a gradual reduction in the solder’s conductive efficiency
corresponding propensity for interruptions in the distribution of
electrical power to the TCM. As this occurred a steadily increasing
transmission faults would arise. Where the TCM was offline for a matter of
milliseconds this might be perceptible to the
driver as a shuddering sensation;
as the problem worsened, however, the vehicle might sustain a total loss of
motive power for a
period of seconds – which was unsafe. This was a fault
which could, albeit in rare circumstances, result in a serious accident.
648 Having regard to the matters set out above, I do not think that vehicles
supplied with the original ATIC 91 chip can be said to
be fit for the purpose of
being driven as a motor vehicle
(s 54(2)(a))
or that they were free from
(s 54(2)(c))
or that they were safe
(s 54(2)(d)).
Consequently, at the time they were supplied vehicles containing the original
ATIC 91 chip were not of acceptable quality.
649 I would have reached the same conclusion even if I had not accepted the
existence of the representations referred to above in
dealing with
s 54(3)(d).
650 From 27 October 2015 a large proportion of vehicles containing the
original ATIC 91 chip have received the 15B22 software update
(at least 86%) and
some of these vehicles may have had their TCMs replaced with a new TCM
containing the revised ATIC 91 chip. I
repeat the remarks I have made about the
legal significance of rectification work above (in relation to the input shaft
651 For completeness, I have not drawn any independent conclusion about the
ATIC 106 chip, so far as it might bear upon the question
is a consequence of the fact, as I explained above in Section VIII, that there
was insufficient material to support a finding
that a real risk of failure
existed in relation to the ATIC 106 chip.
Vehicles with the ‘normal operating
characteristics’
652 It will be recalled
that the Respondent accepts that the vehicles have a tendency to display the
following characteristics:
(a) a slight vibration or shudder under light
acceleration at slow speeds or during a coast down, as the transmission upshifts
downshifts;
(b) firm gear shifting under aggressive acceleration;
(c) a slight audible rattle, particularly when operated within an enclosed area
such as a carpark;
(d) mechanical sounds when shifting, or after the vehicle has been turned off;
(e) a slight shunting sensation at very low speeds.
653 The Applicant submitted that these ‘normal operating
characteristics’ were put forward by the Respondent as those
which were left over after the Component Deficiencies were resolved. She did
not wrestle with the possibility that those
characteristics might be the
consequences of the torsional vibrations to which the Applicant pointed as part
of her Architectural
Deficiencies case.
654 I have explained that (a) and (c) are most likely the result of torsional
vibrations being transmitted through the driveline.
In light of the
Respondent’s positive assertion of these behaviours as something to be
expected, I have accepted that (b),
(d) and (e) are exhibited by the DPS6
without making any finding as to their cause. The shudder which is referred to
in (a) is therefore
a different shudder to that arising from self-excited
shudder or forced-excited shudder. Those latter two kinds of shudder arose
the complex physics attending the interaction of the clutch plate with the drive
plate. The shudder here is different and is
an oscillation transmitted directly
from the crankshaft.
655 Regardless of where these five phenomena fit into the Applicant’s
case, the Respondent’s position was that these behaviours
‘normal operating characteristics’ of the DPS6 and as such could not
have the consequence that the vehicles were
not of acceptable quality. This is
a form of argument by definition. Its limitations may be illustrated. A car
with a tendency
to explode in a fireball would not be of acceptable quality even
if the manufacturer successfully proved that this behaviour was
operating characteristic of the vehicle. This might suggest that proof by a
manufacturer that a characteristic is a normal
operating characteristic is not
legally responsive to a contention that the characteristic is such as to mean
that the requirements
are not satisfied.
656 Of course, where a manufacturer explicitly draws to a consumer’s
attention that a vehicle has a specific eccentricity then
the presence of that
eccentricity will not on its own render the vehicle other than of acceptable

(a) goods supplied to a consumer are not of
acceptable quality; and
(b) the only reason or reasons why they are not of acceptable quality were
specifically drawn to the consumer’s attention before
the consumer agreed
to the supply;
the goods are taken to be of acceptable quality.
657 In this case, however, the Respondent did not suggest that
was the point it was trying to make. Put another way, it did not submit that it
had specifically drawn the attention of purchasers
of vehicles fitted with a
DPS6 to these normal operating characteristics.
658 I have found it difficult to conceptualise the Respondent’s
submissions in a way which can be reconciled with the text of

integers in

legally significant that

to the conclusion that
is satisfied (in this case to do so would be
inconsistent with the initial hypothesis). To avoid that inconsistency it is
necessary to accommodate the submission within the interstices of
itself. But when the argument is broken down and distributed
across the integers of
the problem merely recurs. Thus in terms of

-(e). Perhaps the point is made most clearly with the safety
requirement in
s 54(2)(d).
It cannot be to the point that a quality which
makes a good unsafe is also one of its normal operating characteristics.
659 I therefore conclude that the Respondent’s factual contention that
the five characteristics of the DPS6 are its ‘normal
characteristics’ is irrelevant to any legal issue which arises from
It is therefore not necessary to decide whether as a matter of
fact the Respondent is correct. Lest I have stepped into error in
drawing that
conclusion, however, it is useful to determine that issue.
660 The Respondent’s submission was that the five characteristics were
a feature not only of the DPS6 but also of other dual
clutch transmissions.
This contention was based on the evidence of Mr Kuhn. At §93 he said
that the five characteristics were
not materially different to the performance
of other dual clutch transmissions. He did not identify the other dual clutch
transmissions
he had in mind except in the case of the Hyundai. At §78 he
discussed the Ecoshift DCT which was fitted in some versions of
the Hyundai
Tucson. Mr Kuhn extracted a quote from the ‘2016 Hyundai Tucson
Owner’s Manual’ which suggests that
the Ecoshift DCT was a dry
clutch assembly as well. Mr Kuhn gave no evidence of what the normal
operating characteristics of the
EcoShift DCT were. However, the extract from
the Tucson Owners’ Manual described three such characteristics. These

dry-type clutch transfers torque more directly and provides a direct-drive
feeling which may feel different from a conventional
automatic transmission.
This may be more noticeable when launching the vehicle from a stop or when
travelling at low, stop-and-go
vehicle speeds.
661 He also discussed the Hyundai Veloster, which appears also to have had
the EcoShift DCT. Whilst he did not say what its normal
characteristics were he set out part of the text appearing on its ‘hang
tag’ at §79:
vehicle is equipped with an EcoShift Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT).

662 He did not say whether the Veloster was a dry or wet clutch arrangement,
although it appears likely that given the transmission
is also identified as an
Ecoshift DCT that it was dry. I note also that the Court was elsewhere taken to
Ford US documents that
recorded the Veloster as having a DMF.
663 Mr Kuhn’s principal point at §93 was that the five
characteristics were common to vehicles equipped with dual clutch
transmissions.
He provided only two examples of these. If the evidence was intended to
establish the general proposition that all
vehicles with dual clutch
transmissions have the five characteristics then I do not accept that the
extracts from the Tucson owner’s
manual and Veloster’s hang tag come
close to making such a proposition good. If Mr Kuhn in fact meant (as I
think is more
likely) that the five characteristics are the common inheritance
of vehicles with dry dual clutch transmissions, then the situation
is slightly
better, but in my view, nowhere near adequate. If the Respondent wished to
prove that vehicles with dry dual clutch
transmissions all have the five
characteristics, this was presumably an easy thing to do for an entity in the
position of the Respondent.
I do not know how many vehicles with dry dual
clutch transmissions there are in the market but I think it very unlikely there
only the Affected Vehicles and these two Hyundai models. Indeed,
Mr Cruse’s cross-examination revealed that by 2012 Volkswagen
had vehicles with a dry dual clutch transmission. The significance of the
Veloster and the Tucson is therefore imponderable.
664 That leaves unparticularised Mr Kuhn’s opinion that there are
no material differences between the five characteristics of
the DPS6 equipped
vehicles and the characteristics of vehicles equipped with dual clutch
transmissions generally. I do not accept
this opinion exposes
Mr Kuhn’s reasoning in a way which allows me to scrutinise its
correctness.
665 I therefore do not accept that all dual clutch transmissions or all dry
dual clutch transmissions have normal operating characteristics
that include the
five referred to above. In particular, I do not accept the Respondent’s
submission at [279(a)] that the behaviours
‘are found in millions of other
vehicles’. There was no evidence for this.
666 The Applicant went somewhat further. She suggested that the normal
operating characteristics had not appeared in the initial
owner’s manuals,
advertising material or pre-production documents and first appeared in a
circular to dealers sent in October
2012. Here the implicit submission was
that there was nothing normal about the normal operating characteristics and
their introduction
into subsequent literature was an attempt to re-educate
owners into thinking that their defective vehicles were not defective because
the impugned behaviour was normal. The Applicant added spice to this dish by
quoting from an email within Ford containing the memorable
line ‘In my
view, there is no way we can “explain” our way out of something like
this by declaring that this is
667 By contrast, the Respondent submitted that with new technology like the
DPS6 ‘customer education may be required in response
to feedback from the
668 I do not think that the colourful email assists. In context, it is plain
that a single vehicle is being discussed and the remark
is not addressed to the
five characteristics. There is no doubt, on the other hand, that the Respondent
appears to have realised
prior to the circular of October 2012 that the
five characteristics existed. Whether the Respondent thought that they were
faults and set out to persuade their customers that black was white or
whether the Respondent genuinely believed that black was white,
does not seem to
me to matter. It does not matter because the answer to that question has
nothing to do with
If it mattered, I would be disinclined to
regard this episode as an exercise in pulling the wool over customers’
669 All of that leaves unanswered the questions posed by
have considered the matters in
above and do not need to repeat
them. However, of particular significance, is the finding that the DPS6 was
marketed as providing
smooth gear shifts. I do not think that characteristic
(a) and (b) meet that description. Turning then to
itself, I do
not think vehicles fitted with a DPS6 are ‘free from defect’ within
the meaning of
because they are prone to display a slight
shudder in some gear change situations and exhibit firm gear shifts when driven
with gusto.
670 Whichever way one looks at these phenomena they are not smooth gear
shifts. Perhaps in a vehicle not marketed as the DPS6 was
marketed, the outcome
might be different. However, this is how the DPS6 was marketed and viewed in
that context, as required by
, the vehicles fitted with the DPS6
and therefore prone to these behaviours are not of acceptable quality.
671 I also accept that the tendency to exhibit gear rattling means that the
vehicles were not acceptable in terms of their ‘finish’
s 54(2)(b).
Section 54(2)(b)
refers to ‘appearance and
finish’. I do not think this is a composite expression. The presumption
against superfluity
therefore implies that finish has a meaning which extends
beyond merely visual qualities of the goods. New cars should not have
tendency to rattle, even slightly.
672 However I have pointed out above that the Applicant made no attempt to
connect the normal operating characteristics to its case
alleging that all
Affected Vehicles were defective due to the root causes of inadequate torsional
damping and inadequate heat management.
This is significant because as I
explain more fully below in Section XVI, the Applicant chose to particularise
its case based on
the evidence given by Dr Greiner. This choice meant that
the trial of the
question was conducted exclusively on the basis of
the four alleged Component Deficiencies and two alleged Architectural
Deficiencies.
As I am not satisfied that the Applicant has connected 3 of the 5
normal operating characteristics to its Architectural Deficiency
case (and the
Applicant did not submit they were connected to the Component Deficiencies), it
would be procedurally unfair to consider
these characteristics in assessing
whether the Respondent has complied with statutory guarantee where it was never
asked to meet
this case at trial.
673 I therefore conclude that all vehicles fitted with a DPS6 were supplied
in breach of
, as they are prone to slight shudder at low speeds and
gear rattling, being the two normal operating characteristics that have been
causally linked to the case run by the Applicant on inadequate torsional
damping. No attempt has been made to fix these two characteristics,
vehicles remain afflicted by this risk.
Ms Capic’s vehicle
674 I do not need to
spend much time on this. In light of the conclusions above it follows that
Ms Capic’s vehicle was supplied
to her in breach of
four reasons. It contains a DPS6 the normal operating characteristics of which
made it prone to a slight shudder and rattling,
it contained the original input
shaft seals, it contained a B8080 clutch and it contained a TCM fitted with an
original ATIC 91 chip.
As Mr Pike SC for the Applicant put it, it was
Summary of conclusions on acceptable quality
All Affected Vehicles
73,451 vehicles in the cohort were supplied in circumstances where the guarantee
of acceptable quality under
was not complied with. This was because
they were prone to display the following problems, being the two ‘normal
characteristics’ caused by inadequate torsional damping:
a slight shudder
at low speeds; and
676 The combination of these is sufficient to render the vehicles not of
acceptable quality. These problems have not been resolved.
Input shaft seals
677 The following Affected Vehicles were not of
acceptable quality when supplied because they contained input shaft seals with a
risk of leaking:
(1) Fiestas manufactured before 30 August 2013 (17,274
(2) Focuses manufactured at the Ford Thailand Manufacturing plant before 2
September 2013 (18,068 vehicles);
(3) Focuses manufactured at the Saarlouis plant before 28 June 2013 (11,537
(4) EcoSports manufactured before 1 October 2013 (170 vehicles).
This represents 64.1% of the Affected Vehicles.
678 Vehicles manufactured after those dates did not have this problem and did
not when supplied fail to comply with the guarantee
of acceptable quality by
reason of this matter.
679 Where vehicles on the road have had their input shaft seals replaced with
new input shaft seals containing both the new elastomer
and the steel outer
backing on the inner seal, it is not presently possible to say that any cause of
action for reduction in value
damages exists under ACL s 271(1). For
the reasons given below at [758]-[761] including in respect of the
‘reasonable time’
issue, this cannot be known until the individual
position of each group member is examined. Whether therefore a group member has
a claim for damages under s 272(1)(a) (reduction in value damages) is
unknown. However, a claim for damages under s 272(1)(b) for
damages other
than reduction in value damages is available.
680 Where vehicles on the road received replacement input shaft seals that
had the new elastomer but the original rubber outer backing
on the inner seal, I
have found that neither side proved the extent of the remaining risk in these
replacement seals. I discuss
the implications of this below.
681 Vehicles which have not had their input shaft seals replaced remain not
of acceptable quality by reason of that matter.
Clutch lining
682 Vehicles manufactured with B8080 clutches have
a propensity to develop a range of issues including self-excited shudder. As
they were not of acceptable quality.
683 93.7% of the Affected Vehicles were supplied with the original B8080
clutch lining:
(1) all Focuses (42,498 vehicles);
(2) Fiestas manufactured before 7 January 2015, excluding the 1.0L
‘Fox’ Fiesta (20,734 vehicles);
(3) EcoSports manufactured before 3 September 2016 (5,578
684 Fiestas manufactured from 7 January 2015 contained RCF1o
clutches which do not have this problem. EcoSports produced from
3 September
2016 were made with a half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch; in
relation to these vehicles, the Applicant did not discharge her onus of
that as supplied they were not of acceptable quality by reason of their being
manufactured with the half-hybrid clutch.
I have already explained that no
production change was introduced for the Focus vehicles because from
September 2015 Ford stopped
using the DPS6 altogether in production of
those vehicles.
685 Where vehicles manufactured with B8080 clutches have received replacement
RCF1o clutches it is not presently possible to say whether
a relevant group
member has a cause of action for reduction in value damages because, for reasons
given at [758]-[761] below, the
status of the Respondent’s reliance on
s 271(6) is presently indeterminate. However, such group members remain
entitled to
make a claim for damages under s 272(1)(b).
686 Where vehicles manufactured with B8080 clutches have received replacement
half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutches the Respondent cannot
Applicant’s s 271 claim by relying on s 271(6) (for reasons I
explain later) and the group members are entitled
to make a claim for reduction
in value damages as well as damages under s 272(1)(b).
687 All three model
lines of Affected Vehicles were initially manufactured with TCMs containing
ATIC 91 chips that had a real risk
of developing solder cracks. As
supplied, those vehicles were not of acceptable quality on account of that real
risk. These vehicles
(1) Fiestas manufactured before 23 June 2014 at the
AutoAlliance Thailand plant (20,235 vehicles);
(2) All other Fiestas (from the Ford Thailand Manufacturing plant), all Focuses
and all EcoSports that were manufactured before 10
November 2014 (44,349
vehicles in total).
This represents 87.9% of the Affected Vehicles.
688 New ATIC 91 chips which did not exhibit a real risk of developing
solder cracks were introduced into production at various times
depending on the
model line and place of manufacture. They were installed in Fiesta vehicles
manufactured from 23 June 2014 if produced
at one of the plants in
Rayong, Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand) but for all other Fiesta vehicles and
all Focus and EcoSport vehicles
from 10 November 2014. Vehicles
manufactured with the new chip were not supplied in breach of the
guarantee by reason of the characteristics of the TCM.
689 As I have explained, while there is no direct evidence as to the specific
date that TCMs with the new ATIC 91 chip were available
for installation in
service, it is clear that this happened progressively after 23 June 2014
and 10 November 2014 when those TCMs
were rolled out in production
across the three model lines. Vehicles on the road which have received a
replacement TCM containing
the new ATIC 91 chips have ceased to suffer from
a real risk of failure by reason of this matter from that time. This does not
that they were of acceptable quality when supplied, however. It will be
necessary to return to this issue when considering the legal
implications of the
690 Furthermore, the 15B22 software update was installed in vehicles on the
road from 27 October 2015. The effect of this update
was that the TCM
would detect solder cracking before the progressive symptoms associated with it
were perceptible to the driver and
would in this way cause the vehicle to be
brought in for service before those symptoms manifested. I therefore conclude
vehicles which contain the original ATIC 91 chip but have received
this update, they have also ceased to suffer from a real risk
of failure by
reason of this matter from the time when TCMs with the new ATIC 91 chip were
available to them in service after they
had received the update.
Reduction in value damages
691 For reasons explored
below at [743]ff the group members who are presently entitled to make a claim
for reduction in value damages
(a) all group members but only in relation to the slight
shudder at low speeds and gear rattling;
(b) group members in relation to vehicles supplied with any of the three
original components which have not had any one of these
components replaced but
only in relation to the relevant non-replaced component(s);
(c) group members in relation to a vehicle supplied with a B8080 clutch which
has since been replaced with the half-hybrid B8040/B8080
692 It is also clear that there may be other group members who, after a
consideration of their individual position may be able to
claim reduction in
value damages in relation to a proven Component Deficiency if it transpires that
the relevant component replacement
was not effected within a reasonable
Other damages under s 272(1)(b)
693 In principle, these
damages are available to all group members. The Applicant did not deal in
detail with damages of this kind
in her submissions although she did make a
claim for GST, stamp duty and interest on the alleged reduction in value and for
financing costs. The Respondent disputed that such damages were
available under s 272(1)(b) on the basis, inter alia, that they
foreseeable. I deal with this issue later. For present purposes, the point is
that while the Applicant relied upon Mr
Stockton’s analysis to assert an
entitlement on the part of group members to certain amounts in aggregate damages
finance and repair time costs (presumably, although this was not
entirely clear, under s 272(1)(b)), it would seem that such damages
need to be the subject of further determination having regard to the individual
position of each group member.
Section 271 of the ACL
694 The parties were at
odds about the operation of ACL s 271(6) and s 271(2).
695 A significant number of vehicles have had one or more problems fixed by
dealers under warranty. Where that has occurred, s 271(6)
impacts on the
ability of a person to recover damages for breach of the guarantee of acceptable
quality. It does so by operating
on the provision which confers the
person’s cause of action. In this case, the cause of action is conferred
by s 271(1).
Section 271(6) operates as some form of qualification to
s 271(1). Section 271(1) is itself linked to s 272 which specifies
damages which may be recovered. Also relevant is the right in s 271(5)
to sue a manufacturer for failure to comply with an express
(ie voluntary)
warranty and s 271(2) which perhaps operates as a proviso to s 271(1)
when goods are affected by the conduct of third
parties. All of these
provisions are relevant in this matter. They are as follows
damages against manufacturers of goods
(a) the guarantee under
applies to a supply of goods to a consumer; and
(b) the guarantee is not complied with;
an affected person in relation to the goods may, by action against the
manufacturer of the goods, recover damages from the
manufacturer.
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply
if the guarantee under
is not complied with only because
(a) an act, default or
omission of, or any representation made by, any person other than the
manufacturer or an employee or agent
of the manufacturer; or
(b) a cause independent of human control that occurred after the goods
left the control of the manufacturer; or
(c) the fact that the price charged by the supplier was higher than the
manufacturer’s recommended retail price, or the average
retail price, for
(a) the guarantee under
(1) applies to a supply of goods to a consumer; and
(b) the guarantee is not complied with;
an affected person in relation to the goods may, by action against the
manufacturer of the goods, recover damages from the
manufacturer.
(6) If an affected person in relation
to goods has, in accordance with an express warranty given or made by the
manufacturer of the
goods, required the manufacturer to remedy a failure to
comply with a guarantee referred to in subsection (1), (3) or
(a) by repairing the goods;
(b) by replacing the goods with goods of an identical type;
then, despite that subsection, the affected person is not entitled to commence
an action under that subsection to recover damages
of a kind referred to in
section 272(1)(a) unless the manufacturer has refused or failed to remedy
the failure, or has failed to
remedy the failure within a reasonable
Damages that
may be recovered by action against manufacturers of
(1) In an action for damages
under this Division, an affected person in relation to goods is entitled to
recover damages for:
(a) any reduction in the value of the goods, resulting from the failure to
comply with the guarantee to which the action relates,
below whichever of the
following prices is lower:
(i) the price paid or payable by
the consumer for the goods;
(ii) the average retail price of the goods at the time of supply;
(b) any loss or damage suffered by the
affected person because of the failure to comply with the guarantee to which the
action relates
if it was reasonably foreseeable that the affected person would
suffer such loss or damage as a result of such a failure.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1)(b), the cost of inspecting and returning the
goods to the manufacturer is taken to be a reasonably
foreseeable loss suffered
by the affected person as a result of the failure to comply with the
(3) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply to loss or damage suffered through a
reduction in the value of the goods.
696 There are other guarantees in the ACL but it is only the acceptable
quality guarantee created by
and made actionable by s 271(1)
that is directly relevant in this litigation. Section 271(5) may have had some
potential relevance
but appears to have escaped attention or been thought not to
be worth pursuing.
697 Four issues divide the parties. The first is whether s 271(6)
applies where the consumer has not required the manufacturer to
goods. The second is whether delay in effecting repairs prevents s 271(6)
operating. The third relates to who has to
prove what about s 271(6): does
the Applicant have to prove that it does not apply or must the Respondent prove
that it does? The
fourth relates to s 271(2) and concerns who bears the
onus of proving the acts of the third parties. Before tackling these questions
it is useful to begin with some background information which informs the
questions at hand.
Some background to the provision
Affected person
698 Section
271(1) confers a cause of action on an ‘affected person’. This is
to include a consumer who acquires the goods or someone who
acquires the goods from or derives title to the goods through or under
consumer (which might include, for example, a second-hand owner or a finance
company). In the interests of clarity I will generally
use the expression
‘consumer’ in this discussion but it should be remembered that the
statutory phrase is actually ‘affected
Express warranty in s 271(6)
699 Section 271(6)
refers to the consumer requiring the manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply
with the statutory guarantee ‘in
accordance with an express
warranty’. As most law students studying contract will appreciate, it has
always been a puzzle
how as a matter of contract law a consumer may enforce an
express warranty given by a manufacturer. Certainly this puzzled me at
school. The manufacturer and the consumer are rarely in privity of contract
and, as such, the latter cannot sue in contract
on the warranty.
Section 59(1)
provides the answer. It imposes another statutory guarantee on the
manufacturer, in this case, a statutory guarantee that the manufacturer
comply with any express warranty it has given.
Section 59(1)
Guarantee as to
express warranties
(a) a person supplies, in trade or commerce, goods to a consumer; and
(b) the supply does not occur by way of sale by
there is a guarantee that the manufacturer of the goods
will comply with any express warranty given or made by the manufacturer in
relation to the goods.
700 This guarantee is separate from the guarantee under
goods will be of acceptable quality. What it means, however, is that whatever
warranty a manufacturer gives in relation
to the goods it makes,
requires that the warranty be honoured:
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v Jayco Corporation Pty Ltd
[2020] FCA 1672
’) at [719], [722] per Wheelahan J. Although it is not directly
relevant to this case, for completeness, s 271(5) confers a
cause of action
on a consumer where the manufacturer in breach of the guarantee under
fails to comply with an express warranty. In this case, the
Respondent extended its express warranties on several occasions in relation
transmission repairs. Since the Applicant has not sued on this basis, this
largely does not matter although it has residual interpretative
significance.
701 This significance is that s 271(6) refers to a consumer requiring a
manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply with the guarantee
of acceptable
quality ‘in accordance with an express warranty given or made by the
manufacturer’. Where the manufacturer
has not given any express
warranties then it would appear to follow that the consumer could not require
the manufacturer to remedy
any failure to comply with the acceptable quality
guarantee pursuant to such an express warranty. This in turn suggests that
does not speak to that situation. Another way of saying this is
that the statute imposes no obligation by itself on a manufacturer
to repair or
replace goods which do not comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality. The
only direct statutory right is the
consumer’s right to claim damages under
s 271(1) for breach of the guarantee under
702 This may be contrasted with the situation in relation to the suppliers of
such goods. The immediately relevant provisions for
this case, ss 271-273,
comprise Division 2 of
which deals with the liability of
manufacturers. But Division 1 deals with the liability of suppliers. These
provisions are reasonably
complex but for present purposes it suffices to say in
a fairly loose way that they include a right in the consumer to require the
supplier of the goods to remedy a failure to comply with the acceptable quality
guarantee (s 259(2)) and, where the failure cannot
be remedied or is a
major failure, the consumer may return the goods or sue the supplier to recover
reduction in value damages (s
259(3)). Where this sort of event occurs and
provided certain conditions are met, Division
3 (‘Miscellaneous’) requires
by s 274 that the
manufacturer indemnify the supplier. The operation of Division 1 has been
examined in some detail by Wheelahan
ACCC v Jayco
and by Derrington
703 The point for present purposes is that it is the supplier who stands in
the firing line first and must under Division 1 repair
or replace the goods
unless the failure to comply with the
guarantee cannot be remedied or
is a major failure. No such
statutory obligation rests on the
manufacturer unless it has given an express warranty that it will repair or
replace the goods.
This it may do but is not required to do. But if it decides
to do so the express warranty so proffered is given statutory force
and by s 271(5) the consumer may sue the manufacturer for
failing to comply with its own express warranty. Although the remedial
provisions with respect to suppliers are complex, by contrast there is no
corresponding machinery in the case of manufacturers and
the repair/replacement
process happens under the auspices of whatever the express warranty provides for
(backed up by
and s 271(5)).
704 In a case where goods are not of acceptable quality and the manufacturer
has given an express warranty that it will repair the
goods with which it has
failed to comply, the situation therefore becomes governed by two distinct
regimes. First, the consumer
may sue directly on the failure to comply with the
guarantee of acceptable quality under s 271(1). Secondly, it may sue for
to comply with the express warranty under s 271(5). As I have
said, this second route was not explored in this case.
705 Section 271(6), which is the pivotal provision in the present context,
speaks to both situations as the references to s 271(1)
and s 271(5)
show (the reference to subsection (3) is irrelevant for present purposes and may
be disregarded). Section 271(6) is
a qualification on these two distinct
statutory causes of action. As will be seen, s 271(6) is
poorly drafted. However, standing back from its turbid mysteries, it is
reasonably clear that the drafter was stumbling towards
trying to say that if
the manufacturer repairs or replaces the goods under an express warranty then
the consumer cannot sue for reduction
in value damages either for any failure to
comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality (under s 271(1)) or for any
comply with an express warranty (under s 271(5)). The
consumer’s right to sue for other damages under s 272(1)(b) is not,
however, impaired by s 271(6).
706 The key point for present purposes is that the manufacturer is not
obliged to give an express warranty. Where no express warranty
has been given s
271(6) never becomes relevant. It is therefore entirely possible that
s 271(1) but not s 271(6) may operate in
any given case. In such a
case, the consumer is not left without a remedy for a failure by the
manufacturer to comply with the guarantee
of acceptable quality.
Unquestionably, in that situation the consumer may sue the manufacturer under
s 271(1). Where that happens,
s 271(6) simply never gets into the
The right to damages in s 272(1)
707 Section 272(1)
contemplates recovery of damages for reduction in value (s 272(1)(a)) and
other loss or damage which was reasonably
foreseeable (s 272(1)(b)).
708 More important is the fact that s 272 speaks in terms of ‘an
action for damages under this Division’. Section 271
confers such causes
of action in each of s 271(1), s 271(3) and s 271(5). As I have
already indicated only the causes of action
in s 271(1) and s 271(5)
are presently relevant. The Respondent submitted that the cause of action
conferred by s 271(1) had as
one of its constituent elements the suffering
of loss and damage. Neither s 271(1) nor s 271(5) actually says this
in terms. Both
may be contrasted with s 82 of the Act which relevantly
for damages
(1) A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that
was done in contravention of:
(a) a provision of Part IV, IVB or
(b) section 55B, 60C or 60K; or
(c) subsection 56BN(1), 56BO(1), 56BU(1) or 56CC(1) or section 56CD;
(d) a civil penalty provision of the consumer data rules;
may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person
or against any person involved in the
contravention.
(2) An action under subsection (1) may be
commenced at any time within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action
that relates
to the conduct accrued.
709 In s 82 it is clear that the suffering of loss and damage is a
precondition to the operation of the provision. This understanding
is orthodox:

710 By contrast, s 271(1) and s 271(5) do not precondition the
right to sue on the suffering of loss or damage. Against that it might
that the right they do confer is a right to recover damages. The nature of
those damages is set out in s 272(1)(a) and s
272(1)(b) and consists
of reduction in value damages and any other loss or damage suffered by reason of
the breach which it is reasonably
foreseeable would be suffered. A consumer who
has suffered no loss or damage of the kind recognised in s 272(1) will
certainly fail
to recover damages. But this does not necessarily mean they have
no cause of action. Causes of action in which damage is not a
necessary element
are common enough: actions in trespass and actions for breach of contract are
obvious examples.
711 It is relevant to consider s 273, which provides:
273 Time limit for actions against manufacturers of
An affected person may commence an action
for damages under this Division at any time within 3 years after the day on
which the affected
person first became aware, or ought reasonably to have become
aware, that the guarantee to which the action relates has not been
712 The fact that the relevant limitation period for any cause of action
established under this Division is not determined by reference
to the suffering
of damage further suggests that such damage does not form part of the cause of
713 If matters rested there, I do not think I would conclude that the loss
and damage set out in s 272(1) formed part of the cause
of action in
s 271(1) or s 271(5). However, the triumph of the drafter’s art
which is s 271(6) complicates the picture. It
uses the phrase
‘the affected person is not entitled to commence an action under that
subsection to recover damages of a kind
referred to in section 272(1)(a)
unless...’. Read literally neither s 271(1) nor s 271(5) (being
the subsection referred to)
actually establish an action ‘to recover
damages of a kind of referred to in s 272(1)(a)’ and so read it does
not literally
make sense. What those provisions actually create is a right to
claim unspecified damages with the nature of the damages only later
fleshed out
in s 272(1).
714 If one construes s 271(1) and s 271(5) as not including loss
and damage as part of the cause of action then one is faced with
an intractable
problem of coherence with s 271(6). One should, of course, strive to read
provisions of a statute in a harmonious
Project Blue Sky Inc v
Australian Broadcasting Authority
[1998] HCA 28
; 194 CLR 355 at 281-282
per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. No doubt this amiable fiction is useful
as an interpretative tool but it often requires
much by way of willing
suspension of disbelief. This is particularly so with this provision. In any
event, I conclude that each
of s 271(1) and s 271(5) creates a
separate cause of action in which loss and damage of the kind set out in
s 272(1)(a) and s 272(1)(b)
is respectively an element.
This is admittedly difficult to square with the text of s 271(1) and
s 271(5), however, it is the only
way that one can avoid incoherence in the
reference in s 271(6) to an entitlement to commence an action for damages
under s 272(1)(a).
715 The reference to s 272(1)(a) in s 271(6) also highlights
something which is easy to overlook. Whatever else the provision does,
does it to claims for damages under s 272(1)(a), ie, reduction in value
damages. The provision has no operation where other
damages are claimed under
s 272(1)(b). At this point, we are a long way down the rabbit hole, but an
example of what this could
possibly mean may be imagined and, indeed, may even
be relevant to this case. For example, consider a vehicle sold with the benefit
of a manufacturer’s express warranty that it would repair the
vehicle’s transmission should it suffer from an outbreak
of forced-excited
clutch shudder. The hapless owner presents the vehicle for repair over several
years but each time the vehicle
is not repaired and the problems persist.
Finally, after many years of frustration the manufacturer finally succeeds in
the vehicle. Because the repair was successful, subject to the effect
of the phrase ‘within a reasonable time’ (a matter
to which I will
return), s 271(6) would appear to block any claim the owner would have for
reduction in value damages. Nevertheless,
it would appear to leave alive any
claim for damages she might have under s 272(1)(b) for other damages.
These might include compensation
for having to hire another vehicle. They might
also include an element for frustration and the life-affliction which is several
years of living with a car which just will not behave. Although Mr Pike SC
did not integrate his suggestion that Ms Capic’s
vehicle was a
‘lemon’ into s 272(1)(b), it may be that damages for reasonably
foreseeable loss other than reduction in
value caused by being sold a lemon
might be available under it. And, if they are, I do not think that
s 271(6) would stand in the
way of such a claim.
716 Having cleared the underbrush, it is then useful to proceed to the four
issues which divide the parties.
Is s 271(6) enlivened if a person does not require the
goods to be repaired or replaced?
717 As to the first
issue, the Respondent submits that it is ‘untenable’ to suggest that
the consumer must first require
the manufacturer to repair or replace the goods
before the provision can apply. The reason for this was said to be that the
part of s 271(6) in terms referred specifically to the consumer
having required the manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply with
guarantee. The construction was said to be supported further by the
consideration that otherwise it would operate in an incongruous
fashion. What
was the incongruity? It was that a consumer who had not required the
manufacturer to repair or replace the goods
would nonetheless be able to sue the
manufacturer under s 271(1).
718 I do not accept this submission. Whilst it is true that the provision
does specifically refer to the consumer having required
the manufacturer to
remedy a failure to comply with the guarantee, it does so as a part of a
conditional statement in which the reference
forms the hypothesis to be
satisfied before its conclusion follows. The provision therefore refers to an
existing obligation in
the consumer to require a manufacturer to remedy the
failure to comply with the guarantee in the same way that the sentence ‘If
it is raining I will bring my umbrella’ refers to the existing state of
the weather; that is to say, not at all.
719 Nor do I detect any incongruity. The operation of s 271(6) (and
s 271(1)) is that one cannot get the benefit of repair or replacement
goods under an express warranty and then, having done so, sue for damages on the
very defect which has been remedied. It is one
or it is the other. But that
dichotomy is mute when there is no express warranty in the first place or, even
where there is, where
the consumer has not exercised his or her rights under it.
This conclusion springs from common sense but also from the fact that
provision begins with the word ‘if’ combined with the unavoidable
fact that one cannot extract from a statement in
the form ‘If A then
B’ the proposition A.
720 The Respondent also sought to buttress its construction by contextual
analysis which pointed to what it described as the ACL’s
preference for
‘flexible’ (which I took to mean non-litigious) remedies for
failures to comply with the acceptable quality
guarantee. This argument rested
on the fact that under Division 1 of Part 5-4 it is for the supplier to choose
which remedy to offer:
repair, replacement or refund. Only if the supplier
fails to effect one of these options within a reasonable time may the consumer
reject the goods or recover compensation from the supplier. There are two
problems with this argument. First, as the Respondent
acknowledged and I
described above, in fact Division 1 does expressly contemplate that the consumer
in some circumstances may reject
the goods or seek compensation from the
supplier without the anterior step of the supplier attempting a more
remedy: namely, where the failure cannot be remedied or
is a ‘major failure’. This is difficult to square with the
that the ACL in general abhors the consumer seeking compensation as a
first step.
721 Secondly, to the extent that ACL Part 5-4 provides different
remedial mechanisms in Division 1 (suppliers) and Division 2
(manufacturers)
this would not seem to be a sound basis for reading Division 2
as if it said the same thing as Division 1. Those differences would
suggest (as is obvious) that a different scheme was intended. Neither would
this be surprising – as I have explained,
the consumer does not stand in
the same legal (or indeed practical) relationship to the supplier of goods as it
does to the manufacturer.
I therefore cannot accept the Respondent’s
argument that s 271(6) should be read as if it formed part of a cascade of
steps functionally equivalent to that provided for in Division 1.
722 Consequently, the language of s 271(6) requires the conclusion that
it is not enlivened unless (a) the manufacturer has issued
an express warranty;
and (b) the consumer has in fact required the manufacturer to remedy any failure
to comply with the acceptable
quality guarantee under that express warranty.
723 To be fair, although the Respondent did not rely upon it, there is some
limited support for its position in the NSW Civil and
Administrative
Tribunal’s decision in
Boyer v FRP Pools and Spas Pty Ltd
NSWCATCD 52
where it was found the dissatisfied purchasers of a
swimming pool could not sue under s 271(1) whilst they had not taken up the
offer to repair the pool’s gel-based coating. The point
does not, however, appear to have been argued and, with respect, for
the reasons
I have given it cannot be reconciled with the text of s 271(6) and, in
particular, the first word of the section, ‘if’.
The significance of late repairs
724 As to the second
issue, the provision does not say anything about late repairs or replacements.
Rather, it removes a consumer’s
cause of action if, having required the
manufacturer under its express warranty to make the goods of acceptable quality,
the manufacturer
does so within a reasonable time. The Respondent referred to
this timing requirement as a species of constructive failure to repair
think is a sound description of its operation. If a manufacturer who has been
required to remedy non-compliance with the
guarantee of acceptable quality,
fails to do so within a reasonable time then it is treated as if it had not done
so at all: s 271(6)
will not be engaged. In that circumstance, the use of
the concept of a lately performed repair is not especially helpful and runs
risk of obscuring the statutory question.
725 The question of what a reasonable time is for the purposes of
s 271(6) will depend on the facts in each case. It will depend
at least on
the goods in question and the nature of the problem but other factors may enter
into the equation as well.
Who bears the onus of proof under s 271(6)
726 Section 271(6), even
by the lamentable standards of Commonwealth drafting, lurks near the bottom of
the barrel. Problems with
it include:
(a) it is expressed in terms which suggest that it goes
to the existence of the cause of action (‘is not entitled to commence
(b) it refers to a cause of action for the kind of damages referred to in
s 272(1)(a) when the cause of action conferred by s 271(1)
(c) it is in the form if A then B unless
C (ie the manufacturer has
not repaired or replaced the goods within a reasonable time);
(d) although it is centrally about what happens when goods
are actually
repaired or replaced it avoids referring to that occurrence; and
(e) it has several redundant expressions and
circumlocutions.
727 As to (a), it is difficult to read the expression ‘is not entitled
to commence an action’ other than as going to the
existence of the cause
of action. Because a plaintiff must plead and prove the constituent elements of
his or her cause of action,
this at first blush seems to mean that the plaintiff
must prove the ‘fact’ in s 271(6). Where the fact consists of
statement in the form ‘If A then B unless not C’ this is
problematic. It is also obscure about what happens when the
manufacturer has
not issued an express warranty.
728 As to (b), I have dealt with this issue above.
729 As to (c), in English the statement ‘I will wear a t-shirt unless
it is cold’ means ‘If it is cold I will
wear my t-shirt
which I would otherwise wear’ – more formally, A unless B is
formally equivalent to If B then ~A, otherwise
A (using ~ to represent
negation). The significance of this is that every ‘unless’ clause
conceals a negative. Consequently,
putting a clause after the word
‘unless’ which contains a ‘not’ is essentially
incomprehensible to most readers
not skilled in formal logic because it conceals
a double negative. For example, the statement ‘I will bring my umbrella
it is not raining’ sounds like gibberish to most people (because it
is), but if dissected carefully turns out only to mean
‘If it is raining I
will bring my umbrella which I would not otherwise bring’.
730 This vice appears in s 271(6) but with the added infelicity of
casting the negative concept it uses in terms which avoid the word
‘not’ making the double negative doubly concealed. What is said is
that ‘the manufacturer has refused or failed
to remedy the failure or has
failed to remedy the failure within a reasonable time’. What this means
in English is that ‘the
manufacturer has not remedied the failure within a
reasonable time’.
731 As to (d), it is striking that the critical fact which enlivens the
consequences of s 271(6) – the actual repair or replacement
manufacturer of the goods under warranty – is nowhere to be found in the
provision. This is because the drafter has
decided to capture this central
matter in the event which consists of the manufacturer not failing ‘to
remedy the failure’
to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality.
732 As to (e), it is otiose to speak, as s 271(6) does, of the situation
where ‘the manufacturer has
failed to remedy
failure, or has
failed to remedy
the failure within a reasonable
time’. If the manufacturer has
to remedy the failure then
to remedy the failure – refusal adds not a jot to
failure. It is of course merely an added touch that the clause uses the
‘fail’ to refer to what the manufacturer has not done under the
warranty but uses the noun ‘failure’
to refer to what the
manufacturer has not done under the acceptable quality guarantee, that is to
say, the two failures are not the
same. These combine in the nadir which is
surely the phrase ‘failed to remedy the failure’.
733 Further, it is likewise otiose to deal separately, on the one hand, with
the failure to remedy the failure and, on the other,
separately the failure to
do so within a reasonable time. A failure to remedy the failure is entirely
captured by the idea of failing
to remedy it within a reasonable time – a
fact one can confirm to oneself by asking what the conclusory words
to remedy the failure after a reasonable time’ add to the
734 In effect, the whole of the section after the word ‘unless’
just means ‘unless the manufacturer has failed to
non-compliance with the guarantee of acceptable quality within a reasonable
735 A similar problem appears in the opening part of s 271(6). What is
the difference between a warranty ‘given’ and
‘made’? In short: nothing at all. The provision would have
precisely the same content if it said ‘If
an affected person has, in
accordance with an express warranty given by a manufacturer, required the
manufacturer to remedy a failure
to comply with a guarantee...’
736 What then does this incomprehensible provision mean? The internal logic
of the provision is not affected by translating it into
English. This one can
do by removing the baffling ‘unless’ and replacing it with an
‘if’, suppressing the
concomitant double negatives, switching
‘non-compliance’ for ‘failure’, removing the unnecessary
(a) and (b) and expunging the other stylistic aberrations. When this is
done the provision reads:
‘If a manufacturer who has been required to repair or replace goods
under an express warranty it has given does so within a
reasonable time then the
affected person is not entitled to commence an action under subsection (1), (3)
or (5) to recover damages
of a kind referred to in section 272(1)(a).’
737 As I have said, there is no avoiding that this provision goes to the
existence of the cause of action. As such, it is to be read
s 271(1) in this case. (Similar reasoning would apply to s 271(3) and
s 271(5) but treatment of them may be omitted for
present purposes.) So
read, it is apparent that s 271(6) is just one large ‘unless’
statement appended to s 271(1).
Turning s 271(6) into such an
‘unless’ statement requires the removal of a double negative from
the provision but, as
I have explained, this does not affect its internal
operating mechanics. Reading the two provisions together in this way one sees
that s 271(1) and s 271(6) together mean (removing a few more
unnecessary ‘in relations to’, adjusting some other unfortunate
expressions and applying some commas):
‘If the guarantee under s 54 applies to a supply of goods to a
consumer and the guarantee is not complied with then an affected
person may, by
action against the manufacturer of the goods, recover damages unless the
affected person required the manufacturer
to replace or repair the goods under
an express warranty and the manufacturer did so within a reasonable time, in
which case the
affected person cannot commence an action to recover damages of
the kind referred to in s 272(1)(a).’
738 Viewed that way, it is apparent that s 271(6) is a proviso to a
s 271(1) action for reduction in value damages. The question
then becomes
whether the proviso is in the nature of a justification or excuse, in which case
the Respondent will bear the onus,
or whether it rather represents part of the
‘total statement’ of the cause of action, in which case the onus

McTiernan, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ. This is a question of construction
to be resolved as a matter
of substance rather than form:
Waters v Mercedes
Holdings Pty Ltd
[2012] FCAFC 80
203 FCR 218
per Jacobson, Flick
and Foster JJ. It therefore does not matter, for instance, that the
proviso appears in a different sub-section
(s 271(6)) than the right of
action (s 271(1)) or indeed the guarantee (s 54). Among other
matters, it may be relevant that the
proviso assumes or relies upon
‘additional facts of a special nature’ that are discrete from the
facts which must be
relied upon to make good the claim:
739 In substance, the proviso in s 271(6) is a defence, being in the
nature of a justification or exception which a manufacturer seeks
itself within and, accordingly, in respect of which it bears the onus. A
powerful substantive consideration in support
of this construction has already
been discussed: namely, s 271(1) operates where the manufacturer has not
given an express warranty
or, even if it has, where the consumer decides not to
exercise his or her rights under it. It also operates where the consumer
an action for the damages identified in s 272(1)(b) without
claiming the reduction in value under s 272(1)(a). In that circumstance,
cannot be said that the proviso in s 271(6) forms an essential element of
the right of action conferred by s 271(1). If the proviso
relevant at all, it can only be so as a matter agitated by the manufacturer by
way of answer to the claim. As such, it
is the Respondent who must prove that
it gave an express warranty, that it was required pursuant to that warranty to
remedy the non-compliance
with the guarantee by making a repair or issuing a
replacement and that it did so within a reasonable time: see
[278] per Derrington J with respect to s 262(1).
740 For completeness I note that I have considered the possibility that the
drafter’s choice of the near indecipherable ‘if-then-unless’
structure in s 271(6) was intended to convey implications as to the
distribution of the onus of proving the matters identified in
the provision. On
this view, perhaps what the drafter intended to convey is that the onus is split
within the subsection such that
the manufacturer bears the onus of proving
everything from the opening ‘if’ to the ‘unless’ and the
bears the onus of proving everything thereafter. To my mind however,
such a reading of s 271(6) strays dangerously into the territory
of allowing a
richness of meaning to statutory text which clearly struggles to support it.
One observes, for instance, that the
language could also conceivably support a
split in onus reciprocal to that postulated above (ie consumer first,
manufacturer second).
None of this overcomes the other difficulties discussed
above and, accordingly, I am not inclined to accept such a reading.
Who bears the onus under s 271(2)
741 Leaving aside the
observation that s 271(2)(c) appears to make no sense of any kind,
s 271(2)(a) and s 271(2)(b) are both concerned
with the effect of
third parties on the goods. As with s 271(6) I read it as a proviso to
s 271(1) which is in the nature of a defence,
being a justification or
exception. Consequently, it is the Respondent which bears the onus of proving
it applies. The Applicant
is not obliged to negative it. In any event, the
parties’ submissions render quite unclear the extent to which
s 271(2) is
at issue in the proceeding. Notably, the Respondent at [355]
says that it is ‘impossible to say whether claims of any group
members are
excluded by s 271(2)’. I am not satisfied that the way in which the trial
was run meant that there was any such
factual enquiry. As with the issue of the
‘reasonable time’ under s 271(6) and its application to group
members other
than Ms Capic, the parties just did not litigate this at a
factual level (as I explain shortly). I do not think therefore that one
that the Respondent failed to discharge an onus it bore. Rather, this was not
an issue which was tried in the first hearing.
The absence of a common question
addressed to s 271(2) confirms my impression of the trial’s dynamics. In
any future hearing
s 271(6), it will bear the onus. At this stage, all that has been
is the meaning of the provision.
The implications of s 271(6)
742 It is necessary to
address the position of the group members and Ms Capic separately.
Group members
743 I have concluded
that all the vehicles in the cohort are not of acceptable quality on account of
displaying a slight shudder
at low speeds and gear rattling, being two of the
so-called normal operating characteristics (in this Section I will refer to
as ‘the two normal operating characteristics’). Since the
Respondent has never attempted to remediate those problems
– either by
means of changes in production or by the application of fixes to vehicles
already on the road – no question
of whether those vehicles have been
repaired under warranty arises. The issues concerning the effect of
s 271(6) are irrelevant
to these problems.
744 The question which now arises concerns those vehicles in the cohort which
were manufactured with the original input shaft seals,
the B8080 clutch lining
material and the TCM containing the original ATIC 91 chips but where these
have been replaced by the Respondent
on-road (ie, in service) with new input
shaft seals, a new clutch lining material and a TCM containing the revised ATIC
the 15B22 software update where revised TCMs were available in
service. The question concerns the operation of s 271(6). The clutch
lining issue and the input shaft seals with rubber outer backing raise slightly
different problems and it is convenient to deal first
with the position of the
steel-backed input shaft seals and the TCM.
745 However, before that issue can be assessed it is necessary to confront a
problem which the parties’ submissions did not
address. This concerns the
question of whether s 271(1) confers a separate cause of action for each problem
sufficient to constitute
non-compliance with the guarantee (for convenience each
such problem is described below as a ‘fault’). For example,
particular vehicle suffers from the two normal operating characteristics and a
TCM with a real risk of developing solder cracks
(in this Section, a
‘faulty TCM’), does the group member have one cause of action under
s 271(1) or does he or she have
746 This question is of significance because of the defence afforded by s
271(6). If there is but one cause of action regardless
of the number of faults
then the repair defence under s 271(6) becomes conceptually problematic.
To stay with the example of the
vehicle which suffered on supply (the relevant
time these questions are to be addressed) from the two normal operating
characteristics
and a faulty TCM: what happens if the TCM is replaced within a
reasonable time but the two normal operating characteristics remain
unremediated?
747 If there is but one cause of action for a failure to comply with the
guarantee in s 54 then at the time of supply when the cause
of action accrued
the vehicle suffered from two faults: the two normal operating characteristics
and the faulty TCM. On the basis
of that single cause of action, damages would
be available for reduction in value under s 272(1)(a) and other damages under s
In effect, the single cause of action gives rise to two separate
heads of damages.
748 On this view, the fact that a faulty TCM was subsequently replaced within
a reasonable time would not give rise to a defence under
s 271(6). This
would be because the act of repair did not result in the vehicle being of
acceptable quality. Even after the replacement
of the faulty TCM it would
remain blighted by the two normal operating characteristics.
749 On the other hand, if each fault gives rise to a separate cause of action
then a different result follows. In that situation,
the group member has an
entitlement to sue for reduction in value damages under s 272(1)(a) and
other damages under s 272(1)(b) in
relation to the two normal operating
characteristics. However, he or she has a separate cause of action for the same
heads of damages
arising from the faulty TCM. However, where the TCM has been
replaced by the manufacturer within a reasonable time, then s 271(6)
operate to provide the manufacturer with a defence to a claim for reduction in
value damages under s 272(1)(a) in relation to
750 These then are the two competing interpretations of Division 2 of
Part 5-4 vying for the field. I prefer the second reading.
s 54 as establishing a single norm. That norm may be breached in more than
one way. A vehicle may have several things wrong
with it each of which is
sufficient to mean that it is not of acceptable quality. Each time the norm is
breached s 271(1) confers
a separate cause of action. In terms of
s 271(1) this is because each time the norm is breached ‘the
guarantee is not complied
with’. That expression is neutral on how many
factual matters underpin the failure, that is to say, it is consistent with
either of the interpretations I have outlined.
751 However, I prefer the second interpretation for two reasons. First, it
avoids the anomalous availability of reduction in value
damages in relation to a
fault that has been repaired within a reasonable time in a case where another
fault exists and has not been.
Secondly, s 271(6) refers to the failure of the
manufacturer ‘to remedy
failure to comply with the
guarantee’ (my emphasis) and therefore appears to recognise that there may
be more than one such
752 Consequently, I conclude that each fault constitutes a failure to comply
with the statutory guarantee and gives rise to a separate
cause of action. This
means that the issues which arise under s 271(6) are live in relation to the
input shaft seals, clutch lining
and TCM even though all of the Affected
Vehicles also fail to comply with the statutory guarantee because of the two
normal operating
characteristics.
Replacement of the input shaft seals and TCM under the
Respondent’s express warranty
753 There is no dispute
that where these components were replaced, this had been done by the Respondent
under its express warranty.
Neither party invited me to consider in detail the
terms of the express warranties. In particular, the Applicant did not mount
argument that the repairs had been done outside the scope of any particular
express warranty so that it was not a repair to which
s 271(6) could apply.
754 For the reasons I have given above, it is for the Respondent to make out
a case under s 271(6). To discharge the onus it bears
it is therefore
necessary for it prove in the case of each group member that:
(a) the group member required it to remedy the
non-compliance with the guarantee of acceptable quality by repairing or
replacing the
(b) it remedied the non-compliance with the guarantee of acceptable quality;
(c) it did so within a reasonable time.
755 Whilst s 271(6) stipulates that for it to apply the consumer must
‘require’ the manufacturer to remedy the non-compliance
guarantee it does not say that the act of requirement need be express. What the
provision necessitates is that the consumer
requires the non-compliance to be
remedied by the manufacturer repairing or replacing the vehicle in accordance
with an express warranty.
Where a consumer brings in for service a vehicle
which is not working properly and the manufacturer in fact repairs the vehicle,
I would infer that both understood that the vehicle was to be repaired and that
the moving party in the transaction was the owner
of the vehicle. Even if no
actual words were used it is clear what the parties were intending. If it were
otherwise, the actions
of the manufacturer would be inexplicable. I would infer
from this everyday situation that a requirement in terms of s 271(6)
even if the service had been preceded by a communication from the
Respondent instructing the owner to bring the vehicle in for service
circumstances. Accordingly, I conclude that the fact that each vehicle was in
fact repaired by the Respondent during
a service event by the replacement of the
input shaft seals and/or either the insertion of a new TCM or the installation
where the new TCMs were available in service allows one to infer that
the consumer had required the vehicle to be repaired. Although
one reading of
s 271(6) might be that the consumer had to refer in terms to the guarantee
under s 54, this would give it an operation
which is comical – most
consumers have no idea about s 54 and it would require language of the
clearest kind to arrive at such
an outlandish outcome. Section 271(6) does not
756 I therefore accept that the Respondent has proved the first element (a)
above in any case where it repaired a vehicle by replacing
the input shaft seals
or replacing or updating the TCM in accordance with an express warranty. In
relation to the second element
(b), on the evidence I have found that the
replacement of the input shaft seals with new input shaft seals containing both
elastomer and the steel outer backing on the inner seal and the TCM with
a new TCM containing the revised ATIC 91 chips or alternatively
installing the
15B22 software update where new TCMs were available in service was an effective
solution. Once this was done, to
the extent that the vehicle had not been of
acceptable quality under s 54 because of
problem it ceased to
be non-compliant with s 54 in relation to that problem.
757 I note here that a key factual question relating to the TCM has not been
resolved in relation to the group members. It is not
currently known for each
group member that received the 15B22 software update prior to receiving a
replacement TCM with the revised
ATIC 91 chips whether, in the event the
software had triggered an alert, a revised TCM in fact would have been available
in service. The effect of my conclusions in Section VIII is that if no
such TCMs were available in service to the vehicle, the installation
of 15B22 in
isolation was not an effective repair.
758 An even larger problem emerges at the level of (c), that is, that the
repair was effected within a reasonable time. The Respondent
did not endeavour
to prove that it had done so. On the face of it, therefore, it would appear
that (c) is not satisfied. However,
the picture is more complex than this. It
would, I think, be fair to say that neither party really wrestled with the
significance
of this aspect of s 271(6). The Applicant submitted that
s 271(6) conferred a defence which was for the Respondent to make good,
including on the issue of ‘reasonable time’. As it happens, I have
accepted that submission. She did at [676] specifically
address the obligation
of a manufacturer to remedy the non-compliance with s 54
reasonable time
which may speak for itself:
As to the second condition, the issue of principle is
what is meant by the “reasonable time” in which the manufacturer
must repair or replace the defective good. Although what constitutes a
reasonable time would vary having regard to the nature of
the goods and the
circumstances, it too should be beneficially construed. If the defect were
causing, or had a propensity to cause,
safety issues, the reasonable time would
probably be very short, possibly no more than one or two weeks. The reasonable
defects causing other defects might be longer. However, whatever the
period is, it would not be in the order of many months or years.
Accordingly, if
Ford Australia has failed to repair the defects, or replace the Affected
Vehicle, in a time shorter than months or
years, s 271(6) can have no
application.
759 What this submission did not turn its mind to is how this issue is to be
resolved in relation to group members. There is no doubt
the submission was
suggesting that the Court should determine something about ‘reasonable
time’ but it is obvious that
the question may well have different answers
for different group members. Many of the issues the parties litigated during
did not find expression in a common question. This was one of them.
760 The Respondent submitted that many group members’ claims would be
barred by s 271(6) and that ‘this necessarily involves
into the service history of each vehicle’. I accept that the full
position under s 271(6) cannot be known at this
761 I am satisfied that the issue of whether the repairs were effected within
a reasonable time for individual group members was not
an issue tried during the
first hearing. What this means is that the question of whether the Respondent
is entitled to rely on a
defence under s 271(6) in relation to these two
issues is not presently known either. Because the s 271(6) defence, if
successful,
deprives a group member of a cause of action under s 271(1) it
is therefore also not presently known whether group members whose
vehicles have
had their input shaft seals and/or TCMs replaced/updated have a claim under
s 271(1) for reduction in value damages
under s 272(1)(a) (recalling
that the s 271(6) defence only applies to those damages and not to other
damages under s 272(1)(b)).
762 In Section XIV, I turn to the issue of whether there should be an award
of aggregate damages. The parties seemed clear that this
was to be decided and
there was a common question which reflected the need to answer it. However, the
consequence of this conclusion
is that it cannot be known who has a cause of
action for reduction in value damages for replaced components and hence even to
such an act of aggregation might be applied with respect to those
The replacement of the B8080 clutch lining material and input
shaft seals with rubber-backed replacements under warranty
763 At this point, there
is a twist. In those cases where a B8080 clutch was replaced with an RCF1o
clutch I am satisfied that this
repair was effective. For the reasons just
given, however, it is not possible at this stage to assess the
Respondent’s s 271(6)
764 Where a B8080 clutch was replaced with a half-hybrid B8040/8080 clutch I
have concluded that neither party proved anything as
to its efficacy. Having
now determined that the Respondent bore the onus of proving that the repair was
effective, I conclude that
in the case of these vehicles, no repair has been
effected which might have been sufficient for the purposes of s 271(6).
765 The same is true for the input shaft seals which were made from the new
FKM elastomer but had the original rubber outer backing
on the inner seal.
While the Applicant has not proven the extent of the risk of failure posed by
these seals (meaning vehicles supplied
with them were not in breach of s 54 for
this reason), nor has the Respondent (meaning that when used as replacement
seals I cannot
conclude that a s 271(6) repair has been effectively
performed). As the Respondent bears the onus of making good its s 271(6)
it has not proven that a successful repair has been effected where it
used a seal with the original rubber outer backing.
766 On the findings I have made about Ms
Capic’s vehicle, the vehicle remains not of acceptable quality. Although
vehicle has been frequently repaired, only the replacement of
the TCM and the input shaft seals may be regarded as repairs sufficient
remove the real risk in relation to those components and therefore to remove
those faults as independently sufficient causes of
the vehicle being not of
acceptable quality. However, Ms Capic’s report of her vehicle’s
ongoing symptoms is consistent
with the continued presence of the two normal
operating characteristics and with the prospect (about which there can be no
conclusion) that the installation of a half-hybrid clutch was not an
effective fix. In summary, Ms Capic’s car was not of
acceptable quality
when it was sold to her. It is not of acceptable quality now. Her input shaft
seals were replaced on 30 May
2017, 4.5 years after they were installed and
well after the introduction of steel-backed inner seals. Considering that this
the 13th occasion on which her vehicle was serviced and my acceptance of her
evidence that on each previous occasion she had complained
performance, I do not consider that this was ‘within a reasonable
time’. The same is true for the replacement
of her TCM on
10 February 2016, over 3 years after she purchased the car.
767 In respect of the unsuccessful repairs the question of whether they were
effected within a reasonable time does not arise. However,
at the time of the
replacement of the clutch on 30 May 2017 the vehicle had not been of
acceptable quality for 4.5 years. If I had
found that the events of 30 May
2017 were sufficient to render the vehicle of acceptable quality in relation to
the clutch lining,
I would have concluded that 4.5 years lay outside a
reasonable time.
SECTION XIII: MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE CONDUCT
section deals with the Applicant’s misleading or deceptive conduct case on
behalf of the group before dealing with
her individual claim. It is convenient
to begin with the pleaded case.
The pleaded case
769 The pleaded case on
misleading or deceptive conduct is contained in Section D of the 4FASOC which is
entitled ‘Ford Australia’s
misleading or deceptive conduct’.
Section D has nine headed subsections which are unnumbered. It is useful to add
(1) Vehicle Representations –
(2) Transmission Representations – §§7F-7J
(3) PowerShift Representations – §§7-8AB
(4) Representations were misleading or deceptive: s 18 ACL –
(5) Representations were misleading or deceptive: s 33 ACL –
(6) Reliance – §8F
(7) Ford Australia’s knowledge and omissions –
(8) Omissions were misleading and deceptive: s 18 ACL – §25A
(9) Omissions were misleading and deceptive: s 33 ACL –
770 This outline is useful because it underscores that the Applicant has four
cases relating to misleading or deceptive conduct: the
Vehicle Representations,
the Transmission Representations, the PowerShift Representations and the
Vehicle Representations and Transmission
Representations
771 The implied
representations case alleges that the Respondent represented that the Affected
(a) were, or were part of model lines that were, of good
quality, of good driving experience, typically reliable, typically durable,
safe, without unusual or abnormal maintenance issues, and/or comfortable, or
alternatively were at least consistent with comparator
vehicles in these
respects aside from maintenance issues (‘Vehicle
Representations’);
(b) further or alternatively, contained or were part of model lines that
contained, a transmission system that was not typically
subject to unusual or
elevated risk of failure or early deterioration, typically provided comfortable
or acceptable driving or passenger
experience, typically was safe, not high
maintenance, responsive and/or advanced (‘Transmission
Representations’).
772 The Vehicle Representations and Transmission Representations are said to
arise from conduct which, amongst other matters, also
includes omissions. It
will be seen, therefore, that there are in fact two omissions cases. I will
expand on these two cases shortly.
The conduct (including the omissions) said
to give rise to the Vehicle Representations and Transmission Representations is
for both and attention may for present purposes be confined to the
conduct said to give rise to the Vehicle Representations which
is contained in
the unnumbered particulars to §7A:
The representations were implied. The Applicant relies
on the following:
Ford Australia made the Affected Vehicles
available for sale through its Dealers
Ford Australia marketed, advertised and promoted the Affected Vehicles to
consumers throughout Australia for use as everyday passenger
Ford Australia advertised the Affected Vehicles at a particular price and
offered the Affected Vehicles for sale through its Dealers
at a particular
The absence of any (or any adequate) correcting statement to Group Members
or the public at large by Ford Australia or its Dealers
prior to April or May
2018 disclosing the existence of the Vehicle Defects and/or the PowerShift
Transmission Defect, and the extent
of complaints received from Ford Australia
by customers;
The matters recorded at Ford Australia Admissions, [9], [10];
The price of the Affected Vehicles. During the relevant period, Ford
Australia's minimum manufacturer list prices for new Affected
Vehicles were
around: Fiesta ($17,825), Focus ($22,590), and the EcoSport ($22,790).
773 The matters adverted to in the fifth bullet point do not add anything of
substance to the rest of the list beyond identifying
the Respondent’s
concession that the s 54 guarantee of acceptable quality applied to the
vehicles at the time of supply. It
will be seen that the fourth bullet point
contains the allegation of conduct by omission. The omission particularised
(really, alleged)
is the failure to disclose the Vehicle Defects and/or the
PowerShift Transmission Defect together with a failure to disclose the
the complaints that had been received from customers. The Vehicle Defects and
the PowerShift Transmission Defect are defined
in §6AB and §6AC.
These paragraphs contain a catalogue of problems. However, the Applicant did
not pursue this case about
the Vehicle Defects or the PowerShift Transmission
Defect. Instead, she relied upon Dr Greiner’s evidence and advanced a
that the defects with the DPS6 were six:
Leaking input
shaft seals;
Inappropriate
clutch lining material;
The TCM solder
The rear main
oil seal issue;
damping of torsional vibrations; and
Inadequate heat
management.
774 The Respondent acquiesced in this approach and the abandonment of the
concepts of Vehicle Defects and the PowerShift Transmission
Defect as defined in
§6AB and §6AC. This was unsurprising as prior to trial the Applicant
had informed the Respondent
that further particulars about the defects were
unnecessary because the case would be conducted on the basis of the problems
by Dr Greiner in his report. He explained that each of these
underlying issues gave rise to a range of symptoms (which I have assayed
elsewhere in this judgment). The point for present purposes is that the way the
case was run meant that the defects were said to
be the mechanical deficiencies
identified by Dr Greiner and not the symptoms to which those deficiencies gave
rise. The need for
the class action to be structured in that way so as to
generate common issues is a matter I have noted several times:
Capic v Ford
Motor Company of Australia Limited (No 3)
[2017] FCA 771
Capic v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited (Form of Common
[2020] FCA 884
Capic v Ford Motor Company of Australia
Limited (Knowledge Common Questions)
[2020] FCA 885
and [7] and in
these reasons at Section III. In this Section, for convenience I refer to the
problems explored by Dr Greiner as
‘deficiencies’ in distinction to
what I will call ‘the Defects’ being the Vehicle Defects and the
Transmission Defect as defined in the pleadings.
775 So far as the deficiencies are concerned, earlier in this judgment I have
accepted only the leaking input shaft seals, the selection
of B8080 clutch
lining material, the TCM issue and that part of the torsional vibration case
which consists of the rattling of gears
and slight shudder. Despite the
pleading’s use of the defined terms Vehicle Defects and PowerShift
Transmission Defect, therefore,
the first omissions case rests primarily on a
failure by the Respondent to disclose these mechanical root causes combined with
failure to disclose the extent of customer complaints it had received. I
shall call this case the smaller omissions case.
776 The second omissions case was larger and distinct. It is referred to in
the headings I have numbered above at (7)-(9) and commences
at 4FASOC §20A.
The Respondent is alleged to have known 24 separate matters at §20B(a)-(x).
At §20C it is said that
by reason of those matters the Respondent knew of
the Vehicle Defects and the PowerShift
Transmission Defect’ (my emphasis). The concept of ‘the facts
’ the Defects is a vestige of a time when the case was
being run on the basis of symptoms rather than root causes. The deficiencies
identified by Dr Greiner, by contrast, were root causes and, as such, there
are no facts which may be said to underlie them in a
causative sense. I
disregard in making that statement Dr Greiner’s general observation that
the ultimate cause of all of the
problems with the DPS6 was Ford US’
decision to bring the DPS6 into production too quickly without adequate
pre-launch work.
I do so because, although interesting, that contention lies
beyond the scope of the issues in this case. When one adjusts the pleading
make it work in light of the way the case was run (on the basis of Dr
Greiner’s evidence) I incline to the view that it
should be read as if it
alleged that the Respondent knew of the deficiencies identified by Dr Greiner.
Another way of putting this
is that the Respondent knew of the existence of the
‘real risks’ which I have concluded existed in relation to the
input shaft seals, clutch lining, TCM and part of the inadequate
torsional damping issue.
777 Following certain presently immaterial allegations at §§20D-22,
the pleader alleges at §23 that the Respondent
failed to disclose: the
Defects; the fact that the Respondent had issued customer satisfaction program
notices and bulletins to customers
recalling vehicles for repair; and, the fact
that the Defects persisted even after they had purportedly been repaired.
the pleader alleges that the omissions were misleading or deceptive and
that the Group Members (and Ms Capic) relied upon them in
purchasing their
vehicles: §§25A-25C.
778 This more developed omissions case is not the same as the smaller
omissions case secreted within the case on Vehicle Representations
Transmission Representations found in the particulars to §7A extracted
779 It might have been natural to allege in the smaller omissions case that
the Respondent knew of the same matters as it was alleged
to know in the larger
omissions case, ie the §20B allegations. This has not, however, been done.
a link between the two cases but not the one that might be
expected. The pleader alleges that the Vehicle Representations and the
Transmission Representations (which are based on conduct which includes the
smaller omissions case) were made without reasonable
grounds to the extent they
were representations with respect to future matters: §7E and §7J. The
particulars to these
paragraphs include a reference to §§20B-24A.
§20B contains, of course, the allegations of knowledge.
780 So the smaller omissions case secreted within the cases on Vehicle
Representations and Transmission Representations is that the
Respondent knew of
the root causes of the problems with the vehicles and knew of the level of
consumer complaints and that by failing
to disclose those two matters (together
with some other conduct to which I refer below) it engaged in misleading or
deceptive conduct.
The conduct was misleading or deceptive, so it is alleged,
because the vehicles as supplied in fact contained the relevant defects
the extent the representations were ‘with respect to future matters’
for the purposes of ACL s 4, the Respondent
lacked reasonable grounds for
making them. The Respondent lacked reasonable grounds, so it is said, since it
knew the matters alleged
in §20B. It is
said that the Vehicle
Representations and Transmission Representations were made, however, because the
Respondent knew of the matters
in §20B. Rather, at [600] of her
submissions the Applicant advanced the case particularised at §7A extracted
above, that
is that the fact the representations were made may be implied from
the following alleged conduct of Ford Australia:
(a) making the Affected Vehicles available for sale
through its dealers;
(b) marketing, advertising and promoting the Affected Vehicles to consumers
throughout Australia for use as everyday passenger cars,
and at particular price
points ranging between $17,825 and $22,790;
(c) not making any corrective statement (or adequate statement) disclosing the
Defects or the complaints it had received from customers,
before April or May
(d) supplying the Affected Vehicles to customers with a guarantee of acceptable
quality under s 54 of the ACL.
781 On the other hand, the gist of the larger omissions case is that the
Respondent knew of the matters in §20B and failed to
disclose them thereby
engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct.
782 So viewed, it will be seen that §20B serves two distinct purposes in
the pleading. It alleges the knowledge underpinning
the larger omissions case
at §§20A-25C but is also one of the reasons why the Vehicle
Representations and Transmission
Representations are said to have been
misleading or deceptive – that is, to the extent those representations
respect to future matters’ for the purposes of ACL
s 4, the Respondent did not have reasonable grounds for making them. But,
again, the larger omissions case is not alleged to be one of the reasons why the
Court can conclude that the Vehicle Representations
and Transmission
Representations were made.
783 How did the parties deal with this? The Applicant made no submission
as it affected
group members other than herself (the topic of this section). The only
omissions case actually advanced on behalf
of group members was the smaller
omissions case contained within the case on Vehicle Representations and
Transmission Representations.
Her submissions about those therefore did not
address the case pleaded at §§20A-25C although it is true that she did
extensive submissions about the 24 matters alleged to be known to the
Respondent in §20B and that at §20D(a) at [552]-[583].
discussion appeared in a section of her submissions entitled ‘Ford’s
Knowledge of Alleged Defects’. This
section appears squarely to have been
directed at §20B. The submissions in this section, however, pulled up
short of advancing
the case to which §20B was primarily connected, namely,
the larger omissions case pleaded at §§20A-25C.
784 The problem thus on display is this. No submission has in fact been made
by the Applicant to advance the larger omissions case
§§20A-25C insofar as it relates to group members other than herself.
Submissions have been made about the case
on Vehicle Representations and
Transmission Representations which contains the smaller omissions case. But
here no sound basis was
proffered for a conclusion that the smaller omissions in
fact occurred. As I have explained there are only two elements to the smaller
omissions case: (a) knowledge of the Vehicle Defects and PowerShift Transmission
Defect and which, as the trial was run, means knowledge
of the root causes not
the symptoms; and, (b) the level of consumer complaints.
785 Before considering what to make of this, it is useful to touch briefly on
the Respondent’s position. Under the heading
Australia’s Knowledge of the Alleged Defects’ the Respondent assayed
the allegations of knowledge at 4FASOC
§20B and §20D(a). Like the
Applicant, the Respondent did not deal with the larger omissions case pleaded at
although it thoroughly probed the knowledge allegations
contained in §20B and §20D(a). In the following section of its
submissions, the Respondent then dealt with the misleading or deceptive conduct
case. However, in this section the Respondent confined
itself to dealing with
the Vehicle Representations, the Transmission Representations and the PowerShift
Representations (consisting
of the headings I have numbered (1)-(6) above). It
did not advert either to the smaller omissions case (in §7A) or the larger
omissions case (in §§20A-25C) insofar as they related to group members
other than Ms Capic.
786 When the Respondent came to deal with the case on Vehicle Representations
and Transmission Representations it in fact ignored
the smaller omissions case.
This is apparent from its submissions at [309]:
The Applicant alleges that the Respondent made
misleading or deceptive implied representations about the vehicles. The
Representations’ and the ‘Transmission
Representations’ are, in essence, alleged to be representations as to the
quality, driving experience and durability of the Affected Vehicles and the DPS6
transmission. The Applicant alleges that these representations
can be implied
from the fact that the Respondent:
(a) made the Affected Vehicles available for sale on the market;
(b) marketed, advertised and promoted the Affected Vehicles for use as every day
(c) advertised and offered the Affected Vehicles for sale through its Dealers at
a certain price point.
787 It will be seen that the submission does not refer to the smaller
omissions case. This is odd since the smaller omissions case
was referred to in
the bullet point particular at 4FASOC §7A and in the Applicant’s
submissions at [600], extracted above.
Of course, although the Applicant
referred to the smaller omissions case at [600] in the sense of setting out the
case based on
the Vehicle Representations and the Transmission Representations,
she did not go on to develop any submission about the smaller omissions
and, as I have explained, the allegations at §20B were invoked in this
context not to prove that the smaller omissions
in fact occurred but only to
assert that, should the Vehicle Representations and Transmission Representations
be regarded as future
representations, they were made without reasonable grounds
for the purposes of ACL s 4. However, the reason why the Respondent
the smaller omissions case was disclosed at [328] of its submissions,
namely that it understood that the only claim for determination
by the Court in
respect of omissions was the Applicant’s individual claim as distinct from
the claims of the other group members.
788 So the position the parties got themselves to at the trial on the topic
of misleading or deceptive conduct by omission is as follows.
(a) relied upon the knowledge allegations at §20B
for the proposition that the Vehicle Representations and Transmission
Representations
(of which the smaller omissions were a component) to the extent
they were future representations lacked reasonable grounds but simply
deal with the anterior question of whether the smaller omissions in fact
occurred; and
(b) made no submissions at all on the larger omissions case pleaded at
§§20A-25C insofar as it affected group members other
789 For its part the Respondent:
(a) made no submissions about a case that the Vehicle
Representations and Transmission Representations had been made by reason of
conduct which consisted of
kind of omission (whether the smaller or
larger variety);
(b) made no submissions about the larger omissions case at §§20A-25C;
(c) did make an extensive submission that the Applicant’s submissions
in §20B and
§20D(a) were wrong.
790 The threshold question I must deal with is whether the Vehicle
Representations and Transmission Representations were in fact made.
proffered basis for such a finding was the smaller omissions case, reflected in
[600(c)] of the Applicant’s submissions.
I have just explained that the
Applicant did not advance any reasons in her submissions for concluding that the
smaller omissions
in fact occurred and, as such, they do not assist on the
threshold question of whether the Vehicle Representations and Transmission
Representations were made. I have pondered whether I could myself seek to put
together the Applicant’s submissions about the
smaller omissions case by
picking over the wreckage of §20B and seeing what can be repurposed from
it. However, I do not think
that I should do that. It is not the Court’s
role to fill the gaps with what it thinks might have been but was not said,
particularly
in litigation of the present kind. Further, to give §20B a
second purpose different to the one the Applicant actually advanced
procedurally unfair. I will return to §20B shortly but there are other
more fundamental problems with it and its relationship
with the way the
Applicant ran her case which make it perilous to step foot into it.
791 Approaching the question, therefore, in a context in which the smaller
omissions are absent because the Applicant said nothing
Applicant is left with [600(a)-(b),(d)] of her submissions. In substance, the
Applicant invites the Court to conclude
that the Vehicle Representations and
Transmission Representations were implied by the Respondent’s conduct in
marketing the
cars as everyday passenger vehicles at particular price points and
supplying them through its dealers in circumstances where the
guarantee applied.
792 I do not accept that such conduct could give rise to the alleged
representations which, as the outline at the beginning of this
demonstrates, in substance are that the vehicles and the DPS6 provided a good
driving experience which was not subject to
an unusual or elevated risk of
failure. Without a case that the Respondent knew that there was something wrong
with the vehicles,
it is difficult to see how such an implied representation
could arise. As Giles J explained in
McWilliam’s Wines Pty Ltd v LS
Booth Wine Transport Pty Ltd
(1992) 25 NSWLR 723
at 729 where one party
knows something which is not revealed to the other, silence can in an
appropriate circumstance give rise to
an implied representation. But I know of
no case where silence has been held to give rise to an implied representation
where there
is no such information asymmetry. As this aspect of the case has
finally fallen out, it is not open to conclude that any relevant
793 It follows that the Applicant’s case on Vehicle Representations and
Transmission Representations fails at the threshold
and the question of whether
any such representations were misleading or deceptive does not arise. This also
means that there is
no need to deal with the curious but irrelevant dispute
between the parties about the knowledge allegations in §20B insofar
relate to the question of whether one should conclude that the representations
had been made (cf the different issue of whether,
if they were made they were
representations as to the future made without reasonable grounds because the
Respondent knew of the matters
in §20B) and as I have noted already, these
are the only matters advanced by the Applicant, as no submissions were made on
larger omissions case to the extent it affected group members other than
Ms Capic. There remains the possibility that a Full Court
on appeal may
find clarity and substance in the Applicant’s case on Vehicle
Representations and Transmission Representations
where I have found only chaos.
On this view, it would be useful for me to resolve the factual matters in
§20B to relieve the
Full Court of the need to do so if it takes the view
that those matters have dispositive significance on this aspect of the case.
794 I have concluded that I should not do this. This is because in addition
to its irrelevance, §20B also reflects a heresy
which was purged from the
rest of the case at a much earlier time but which appears to have lingered in
the purgatory which is the
misleading or deceptive conduct case. As I have
mentioned already, the Applicant’s case was originally about symptoms but
was changed to a case about root causes. The symptoms misconception, however,
has never been fully expunged from the pleading but
has lived on in little nooks
and crannies in the 4FASOC including in the definitions of the ‘Vehicle
Defects’ and ‘PowerShift
Transmission Defect’ (which proceed
largely by reference to symptoms). But the trial was run for 6 weeks on the
basis of the
root causes. That disjunct between how the Vehicle Defects and
PowerShift Transmission Defect were pleaded and how the Applicant
ran her case
on Dr Greiner’s evidence (with no demur from the Respondent) has
seismic consequences for the pockets of the pleading
where the symptoms case
still lurks. One of those places, unfortunately, is §20B. Its allegations
are largely about symptoms
(although there is the odd stray reference to an
underlying cause – nothing is tidy in this pleading). But unlike the
of the Defects, the caravan of the Applicant’s case about why
the representations were misleading has long moved on and is
now based on Dr
Greiner’s views about root cause problems. Indeed, the Applicant was
explicit in her submissions that the
alleged conduct in the case on the Vehicle
Representations and Transmission Representations (including the smaller
omissions case)
was misleading or deceptive precisely because the vehicles
suffered from the problems identified by Dr Greiner.
795 So even on a very generous interpretation of the pleading and the
relationship between the alleged symptoms and the root causes
function of the way the case was run, one is still left with the difficulty that
the failure to disclose the symptoms
which the Respondent is alleged to have
known about is said to be misleading or deceptive because of the
Respondent’s knowledge
of the root causes of those symptoms. But where
the same symptoms often proceed from
root causes this is
unworkable. For example, clutch shudder (in its various guises) may be caused
by the leaking input shaft seals,
the B8080 clutch lining material and the TCM
solder cracks. To allege that the Respondent knew of the symptom of clutch
and this was misleading or deceptive because it knew about the
mechanical deficiencies of the B8080 clutch lining material just leads
conceptual chaos where clutch shudder can also be caused by the TCM solder
cracks and the leaking input shaft seals.
796 In that circumstance, I conclude that not only is §20B divorced from
any viable issue in the context of the misleading or
deceptive conduct case
brought on behalf of group members other than Ms Capic but that its
‘architecture’, perhaps ironically,
is inherently deficient. For
completeness, the Applicant’s oral submissions on this were as follows at
T1603.4-14:
... Misleading and deceptive conduct, 29 through to 32.
In the interests of time I’m content to rely upon our written submissions
because I think they do set out our arguments and
I don’t think
there’s much need in there. There are a few document references but
they’re largely to the marketing
and promotional material that I took your
Honour to at the start of play yesterday, so I don’t feel the need to take
this afternoon in taking your Honour to that material. So what that
means for present purposes is that I’m content to rely
on what we’ve
said in writing in relation to misleading and deceptive conduct and so I can
then move through to 33...
797 I do not think this advanced matters. I decline to deal with the larger
omissions case insofar as it pertains to group members
other than Ms Capic.
798 I note the parties also joined issue on whether the Vehicle
Representations and Transmission Representations were with respect
matters for the purposes of ACL s 4. Had it been necessary to decide, I
would have concluded that they were not future
representations for the purposes
of that section because in substance they related only to the existence (or not)
of various risks
of failure which inhered in the vehicles at the time of supply.
That is to say, a representation that certain risks did not exist
in relation to
the vehicles was a representation about the quality of the vehicles at that
point in time; properly understood, it
was not a prediction that the failures in
respect of which the risks existed would not eventuate. It is not necessary
to determine the actual case advanced by the Applicant as to why there
were no reasonable grounds but, one may note as I already
have, that it was
based on §20B. For the reasons I have given, I do not propose to make
findings about §20B in the context
of the misleading or deceptive conduct
claim brought on behalf of group members other than Ms Capic.
The PowerShift Representations
799 It is not in dispute
that between November 2013 and 11 May 2016 the following appeared on the
Respondent’s website:
When it comes to transmissions, people are generally
either manual or automatic fans. But what if you could get the best of both
in the one gearbox? The sporty feel and efficiency of a manual, with the
ease of an automatic.
The transmission automatically engages the next gear in the sequence in
anticipation of the shift, so gear changes are quick and
power delivery is
seamless, whether accelerating or slowing down.
PowerShift transmissions are sealed for life and engineered to last 10 years or
240,000 kms, making them extremely low maintenance.
800 The Applicant pleaded at §8A that this conveyed to the public
(1) Gear shifts and acceleration would be smooth;
(2) Vehicles fitted with the PowerShift Transmission would be extremely low
maintenance; and
(3) Vehicles fitted with the PowerShift Transmission would thereby have the same
driving ease and convenience as a vehicle fitted
with an automatic transmission.
(collectively,
PowerShift Representations
801 Neither party took me to evidence about the website beyond a screenshot
of what appears to be a mobile version of a webpage containing
the PowerShift
Representations, apparently from 2016, that was referred to in closing
submissions. I was not shown any other examples
containing representations in
the same terms nor contextual information such as where the page was located
within the Respondent’s
website. All that is known of it, so far as I can
see, is the text admitted in the pleadings. The Respondent correctly said that
context was important but did not take me to any context. The cases are clear
that ‘context is critical’ in this area:
Chowder Bay Pty Ltd v
[2018] FCAFC 25
per Besanko, Markovic and Lee JJ,
Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd
[1982] FCA 136
(1982) 42 ALR
at 199 per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ and
Parkdale Custom Built Furniture
Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd
[1982] HCA 44
(1982) 149 CLR 191
at 198 per Gibbs CJ.
802 It is the Applicant which bears the onus of proving that the ordinary
reasonable consumer would have understood the webpage to
representations alleged. It is therefore the Applicant that bore the onus of
proving what the context was. She has not
proved a jot about the context. It
is not open to me to make a finding about this without the context having been
proved. For all
I know the webpage might have been reached after a disclaimer.
803 I reject the case based on the PowerShift Representations. There was a
dispute as to whether the webpage was available outside
the date range of
November 2013 to 11 May 2016. The Respondent has admitted that it was
available during that time but has not otherwise
admitted any further date
range. I do not accept that the Applicant came close to proving it was
available outside that range.
She obtained from Mr Karageorgiou during
cross-examination some very general statements about the availability of
brochures and the
Respondent’s key marketing messages. This was not
sufficient.
804 Ms Capic submitted that if the Court were
satisfied that the Vehicle Representations, Transmission Representations and
Representations had been made then it should be inferred that she was
misled by them. Since I am not satisfied that it has been
proved that those
representations were made, that issue does not arise. To be clear,
Ms Capic did not suggest that the forensic
mechanics of any of these three
cases differed in relation to her individual position from that of other group
805 Section 6.3.3 of Ms Capic’s submissions was entitled
‘The omissions case’. This submission appears to involve
invocation of the case at 4FASOC §§20A-25C which above I labelled the
‘larger omissions case’. The submission
is not explicit in this but
since it is treated separately from the submissions on the Vehicle
Representations, Transmission Representations
and PowerShift Representations
this appears a likely interpretation of it. It is, of course, this very
submission which is missing
from the submissions made on behalf of the other
group members dealt with in the preceding paragraphs.
806 However, the case advanced in relation to knowledge is much narrower in
scope than the allegations pleaded at 4FASOC §20B.
Ms Capic submits
at [634] that by December 2012 the Respondent knew that:
(a) Affected Vehicles were exhibiting shudder and that
this was a common issue;
(b) it had received 284 complaints about Affected Vehicles in relation to issues
including excessive clutch shudder, excess noisiness
from the transmission,
delayed acceleration and excessive shuddering and jerking when accelerating;
(c) TCM failures were an issue in Affected Vehicles.
807 The Respondent accepted that this was part of the larger omissions case.
Indeed, at [328] it made the submission that ‘the
only claim for
determination by the Court in respect of the Respondent’s Alleged
Omissions is the Applicant’s individual
claim’. The implication of
this – that the Applicant omitted to put the omissions case on behalf of
other group members
– is a proposition which I have upheld above. The
case at §20B therefore falls to be determined for the purposes of what
alleged at §§20A-25C. However, the Applicant did not advance all the
allegations contained within the 24 sub-paragraphs
of §20B. Instead, she
relied only on the 3 matters (a)-(c) set out at [634] of her submissions which
have been extracted above.
808 The Respondent did not suggest that this alleged knowledge lay outside
the scope of §20B and I proceed on the basis that
this case is open to the
Applicant. Dealing with each in turn:
The Affected Vehicles were exhibiting shudder and that this
was a common issue
809 The evidence for
this was an email from Andrew Puglia to Shriraj Makim and others. I accept that
Mr Puglia worked for Ford at
the relevant time. The email reads:
See attached 6-panel.
We have seen a number of these “shudder” cases in Aus (in fact we
were the first to raise the issue with TDE back in
Nov 2011, but we didn’t
get any traction until FNA started seeing warranty concerns for the same
In most cases, we’ve had success with older production vehicles by
changing the clutch pack for this issue. Cal re-flashing
rarely worked (contrary
to the claims in the 6-panel)
Recently we also saw a vehicle with this issue that also had some strange
grattle like symptoms (Adrian’s vehicle).
Martin/Adrian – can you confirm if/how the issue was fixed on that
810 This is the final email in a chain of many emails. Without setting those
emails out, it is apparent that they are referring to
a clutch shudder problem
in respect of which the end of line clutch sorting antidote was implemented by
Getrag. It is clear in my
view that this is a reference to the manual process
of clutch sorting which was instituted to overcome the problem of forced-excited
shudder caused by geometric misalignment (see Section VII). In fact the
topic being discussed in the chain is the possibility that
introduction of manual sorting of the clutch assemblies by Getrag to address the
issue of geometric variability, there
were still cases of shudder being
reported. Here the implication was that it was necessary to trace the vehicles
in which shudder
was present to identify if their production dates were before
or after that time (‘the break point’). If it had happened
the break point, so the idea ran, it implied that the clutch sorting was not
working or that there was some other problem.
811 Ms Capic also referred to a page in one of the attachments to this email
chain in which the following appears:
Tip in shudder appears dominated by engine
order vibration in vehicle line X direction (fore/aft)
Shudder lasts for approx. 1 sec after initial tip-in
Shudder coincides with flare in engine rpm, suggesting the clutch may be
slipping during the tip in shudder event
Recommendation
Swap transmission between good and bad vehicles
and confirm if issue follows transmission.
If so, send transmission back to GFT/TDE team for teardown analysis.
812 I am not sure what one gets from this. As is abundantly clear by this
point in the reasons, the use of the word ‘shudder’
without more
does not go far by way of explanation. Nor is much ascertained by the reference
order vibrations which may be found in a number of the
Respondent’s documents along with references to 2
vibrations. Some of this material related to the issue of geometric
misalignment in the clutch assemblies. It is possible
therefore that this
passage may be married up with the reference to the sorting problem in the body
of the email chain. But the
Applicant did not suggest this and to reason in
that way I would be really guessing at what the Applicant’s submissions
trying to say.
813 Nevertheless, I accept on the basis of this email chain that the
Respondent was aware in 2011 prior to the purchase by Ms Capic
vehicle that there had been a ‘number of shudder cases’ in
The Respondent had received 284 complaints about the
Affected Vehicles in relation to issues including excessive clutch shudder,
noisiness from the transmission, delayed acceleration and excessive
shuddering and jerking when accelerating
814 The basis for this
was said to be §§32, 33, 37 of the Statement of Agreed Facts and
Admissions tendered in the proceeding
brought by the ACCC against the Respondent
in this Court:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ford Motor
Company of Australia Limited
[2018] FCA 703
360 ALR 124.
Those paragraphs
are as follows:
32 By 2011, Ford Australia and its Dealers had started
receiving complaints from Customers about issues with, and the operation of,
their Vehicles (
). Each year between 2011 and 2016 these
complaints intensified in number and scale, such that by 2015 and 2016 Ford
Australia and
its Dealers were receiving complaints from Customers in the
several thousands.
33 The Complaints related to, amongst other things, excessive clutch shudder,
excessive noisiness from the transmission, delayed
acceleration, and excessive
shuddering and jerking when accelerating.
37 The total number of “cases” opened by the CRC relating to
Vehicles in each calendar year were approximately:
815 The Respondent submitted that at best this document was evidence of what
matters the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
and the Respondent
had agreed did not need to be proved in that proceeding. The statement was
tendered in that proceeding under
Evidence Act 1995
and is certainly evidence of that. However, it is also
evidence from which it could be inferred that statements in the paragraphs
correct. Here the thinking would be that the Respondent would be unlikely to
agree as a fact something which was not a fact.
Against that, it might be said
that the Respondent may have taken the course in the other proceeding of
agreeing facts for tactical
or pragmatic reasons. Both inferences are open on
the paragraphs. I think the former inference more likely than the latter. I
may more confidently draw that inference where the Respondent did not produce a
witness to suggest that it was the latter course
which was correct:
[1959] HCA 8
(1959) 101 CLR 298
at 308 per Kitto J, 312 per Menzies J
and 319 per Windeyer J;
Manly Council v Byrne
[2004] NSWCA 123
per Campbell JA, Beazley JA agreeing at [1] and Pearlman AJA
agreeing at [2]. However, I would draw the inference even without resort
Jones v Dunkel
. It merely makes me more confident in the correctness of
the inference.
816 So to hold is not to regard the representations in the statement as
‘previous representations’ for the purposes of
Evidence Act
(‘Hearsay’) which, as Ryan J explained in
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pratt (No 3)
175 FCR 558
, they are not. That is to say, while each
representation in the statement is ‘no more than a representation by each
to the proceeding that he, she or it will not dispute the asserted fact in
that proceeding’ nonetheless it is open to this
Court to infer from the
parties’ decision so to eschew such disputation that the asserted fact is
true. As I have said, I
draw that inference with greater confidence having
regard to the absence of contradictory evidence which it was peculiarly within
the Respondent’s power to lead.
817 While Ryan J also explained at [84] that the representations in such
a statement are not ‘admissions’ for the purposes
Evidence Act
, nonetheless it is noteworthy that in civil proceedings the
rule has long been that ‘formal admissions made by attorneys of
at a first trial could be relied on at the second trial after the first verdict
had been set aside’:
Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd
[2008] FCA 369
167 FCR 314
per Rares J, citing
Wetherell v Bird
[1834] EngR 1035
(1833) 111 ER 63
7 Car & P 6
at 7 per Lord
Denman CJ. In other words, it has never been thought that admitted facts
may have vitality only within the four corners
of the proceeding in connection
with which they were admitted.
818 I therefore accept the truth of the matters appearing at §§32,
33, 37 and I find that in 2011 there were 284 cases opened
by the Respondent
relating to complaints about vehicles with a DPS6 and that these related to a
variety of problems including clutch
shudder. On the basis of the paragraph I
am unable to determine how many of the 284 complaints related to which problem.
The Applicant
did not attempt to unscramble that egg.
The TCM failures were an issue in Affected
819 Ms Capic’s
submissions cited no evidence for this claim. Accordingly, I do not accept it.
Within the bowels of 4FASOC
§20B, at sub-paragraph (f), the pleader refers
to a Ford US document to which recourse might have been made in the context
the Applicant’s submissions on this claim at [634] and the matters
argued there. As I have already explained, I do not consider
it appropriate or
procedurally fair for me to comb through §20B and seek to repurpose
portions of it which were not invoked
or advanced by the Applicant in her
submissions on misleading or deceptive conduct. In any event, the Respondent
cavilled with the
Applicant’s reliance on this document in the context of
the submissions she made on Ford Australia’s knowledge. For
I outline below, I have concluded that the Applicant has not made good her claim
that there was a ‘free flow’
of information from Ford US to
Ford Australia which would have had the effect that any knowledge on the part of
the former evidenced
by this document, assuming it had been relied upon at
[634], could be attributed to the Respondent.
Some implications
820 I therefore find
that the Respondent knew that there had been a number of shudder cases in
Australia in 2011 and that there had
been 284 complaints in that year which it
had logged relating to a number of symptoms including shudder.
821 Ms Capic’s pleaded case at §20B and §20C is that the
knowledge of the Respondent gave it knowledge of the facts
underlying the
Vehicle Defects and the Transmission Defects. I have already explained the
difficulty with using those concepts given
the way the case was run based on Dr
Greiner’s evidence. As I have said, the coherent way to approach the
matter is on the
basis that it is being alleged that the Respondent knew about
the deficiencies identified by Dr Greiner. On the finding I have just
it is not open to infer that the Respondent was aware in 2011 of the problems
identified by Dr Greiner.
822 Ms Capic submitted instead that the matters which I have just found
the Respondent knew were matters which should have been disclosed
Ms Capic. This does not reflect any pleaded case but this does not matter
since the Respondent appeared content to meet the case
actually put in the
Applicant’s submissions. For completeness there is an allegation at
§23A which might be relevant
to such a case but it is not pitched at what
was known in 2011.
Was there misleading or deceptive conduct?
823 Given those
conclusions it follows that Ms Capic’s individual claim on the larger
omissions case cannot succeed. Knowing
that there had been a number of cases of
shudder in 2011 and 284 reports of a variety of issues cannot logically be
connected with
the idea that the Respondent was bound to draw to
Ms Capic’s attention the deficiencies described by Dr Greiner. Even
case is reimagined to be the unpleaded case that the Respondent should
have disclosed to Ms Capic that there had been a number of
cases of shudder in
2011 and 284 complaints relating to a variety of issues, I do not accept, given
the numbers of vehicles involved,
that these kind of numbers were sufficiently
material to enliven any obligation on the Respondent to say something. In any
such a case will not be found in Ms Capic’s pleading.
824 Further, the evidence does not establish that the Respondent knew prior
to 24 December 2012 (the date Ms Capic purchased her vehicle)
the matters described by Dr Greiner. The reasons for this are as follows. In
the section of her submissions entitled ‘Ford’s
Knowledge of Alleged
Defects’, Ms Capic developed a theory that there was a free flow of
information between the Respondent
and Ford US. On the assumption that
that theory is correct the next step in the argument is that Ford US was
aware prior to 24 December
2012 of the matters described by Dr
825 It is convenient to deal with the second step first. Ms Capic did
not develop any submissions as to why Ford US should be taken
knowledge prior to 24 December 2012 of the problems identified by Dr Greiner.
Such a case was pursued in relation to the
matters alleged at §20B.
However, the version of the §20B case which Ms Capic pursued in relation to
the larger omissions
case was that argued at [634] which relies only on the
three matters there set out. There are documents referred to in a separate
section of Ms Capic’s submissions which might suggest that Ford US
had knowledge of some aspects of the Greiner-framework issues
prior to 24
December 2012. However, it would be procedurally unfair to rely upon these
matters for two reasons. First, four of
the paragraphs involved ([562], [571],
[576] and [579]) rely on documents which I have concluded ought not to be
considered since
the Applicant did not adequately notify her reliance upon them
until the delivery of her closing written submissions. Secondly,
case is not directed to proving something about knowledge as at 24 December
2012. Simply now to transplant that aspect
of the §20B case into the form
in which Ms Capic ran her own version of the larger omissions case (ie the three
matters at [634])
would be procedurally unfair on the Respondent who has never
been required to meet such a case.
826 The question of whether that unproven knowledge should be attributed to
the Respondent therefore does not arise. Had it arisen
I would have rejected
827 Briefly, the reasons for this are as follows. The Applicant submits that
the Respondent should be taken to be aware of matters
of which Ford US was
aware because of the free flow of information between the two. The evidence for
this free flow was as follows:
(a) Mr Cruse gave evidence that the
Respondent’s quality organisation interacted with counterparts within
Ford US in relation
to DPS6 issues;
(b) Mr Karageorgiou’s team dealt with the Ford Asia-Pacific team who in
turn dealt with the lead engineering organisation within
(c) Mr Karageorgiou and Mr Cruse gave evidence of the free flow of
information concerning the DPS6 between personnel within the Respondent,
Ford’s Asia-Pacific team and Ford US. Mr Cruse gave evidence
that the lead engineering team within Ford US worked on the DPS6
shared their learning in a free flowing way with the teams in the Asia-Pacific
and within the Respondent;
(d) Mr Cruse gave evidence that the Respondent had access to documents
created by Ford US concerning the DPS6.
828 As to (a), I do not accept that Mr Cruse’s evidence
establishes this matter. At T682 he was being cross-examined about
to the RCF1o clutch lining. He was taken to a particular 6-Panel report and
asked some questions. The relevant portion
of the transcript is T682.10-22:
All right. So it’s your evidence, is it, that you
didn’t see this document in August 2013?---Correct.
All right. Now, you can’t give any reason why, can you, the North American
people would not have shared this document with
the Asia Pacific and Australian
counter parts at or about this time?---No specific reason, but the function of
the LEA is to investigate
and develop the rectification. At my end, Mr Pike, I
in the Australia role, receive TSBs and field service actions ready to implement
to dealer. So I would not expect to receive this to me ordinarily, or as a
matter of normal process from an LEA elsewhere in the
But you had the concern monitoring team that was dealing with the issue with the
Americans, correct?---Yes. They were based in our
building, Mr Pike, yes.
829 An LEA is a ‘lead engineering activity’. Mr Cruse
appears to say that he would not normally expect to receive the
‘from an LEA elsewhere in the world’. The Applicant relies on the
final question and answer. Mr Cruse appears
to say that the concern
monitoring team was in his building. It is possible that the answer he first
gave ‘yes’ implied
that the team were dealing with the Americans but
this is not clear to me. It is equally possible he was saying that the concern
monitoring team was dealing with the issue.
830 As to (b), the portion of Mr Karageorgiou’s evidence relied upon is
T568.14-19 and T568.32-38. It contains no evidence
to the suggested effect.
This may be because here too the Applicant was referring to the earlier version
of the transcript of this
day of the trial. It seems, therefore, that the
Applicant had in mind T567.14-19 and T567.32-38 of the reissued transcript which
contains this exchange:
What other channels are you referring to in giving that
answer?---Well, it could be either dealer reports or technical hotline calls
that we get; that’s the other channels.
All right. Then you were aware, weren’t you, that work was being done by
Ford elsewhere in the world to try and work out what
the root cause was?---At a
point in time I became aware. Yes.
All right. And did you speak to anybody at Ford in the US or anyone who was
actually doing that work?---I – I don’t recall
speaking to anybody,
because we don’t deal directly with the lead engineering organisation. We
work through our regional service
engineering who provides that information to
Okay. So it went up through Asia Pacific. That was the information line; is that
correct?---That is correct.
831 I do not think this exchange supports the proposition for which the
Applicant contends. Mr Karageorgiou’s evidence rises
only to demonstrate
(i) that he did not deal with Ford US and (ii) that he instead dealt with
Ford Asia-Pacific. The answers he
gave were not addressed to the existence or
nature of any information flow from Ford US to Ford Asia-Pacific, let alone
US to Ford Australia. I note for completeness that answers
given elsewhere in this section of the cross-examination suggest that
Mr Karageorgiou became aware of the fact that Ford US was undertaking
root cause analysis on shudder by speaking to the Asia-Pacific
team. However
there is no suggestion that the substance of the information
Mr Karageorgiou thereby received went beyond the mere
investigation was occurring. Even if such evidence existed it would not,
without more, ground an inference that this was
typical of the information flow
between the Asia-Pacific team and Mr Karageorgiou, let alone between that
Asia-Pacific team and Ford
US. Therefore this evidence does not support
the proposition that there was a ‘free flow’ of information from
to the Respondent.
832 As to (c), two portions of Mr Karageorgiou’s evidence were relied
upon. The first was T578.1-6. Mr Karageorgiou was being
cross-examined about
what information from Australia was conveyed elsewhere in the organisation. At
T577.42-T578.6 this exchange
All right. But what’s your best recollection now
– my recollection of around 2012 was we would have had our local team
still working with a regional team.
All right. And so what’s – is an aspect of what the local team is
doing is analysing warranty and complaint data, is
that an aspect of it?---That
is correct. That is correct.
All right. And is that then being fed up at the regional level – to the
regional level, sorry?---That’s correct.
And was it your expectation also that that would then be even fed up further up
the line to Ford in the US?---That – yes, if
there was – if it was a
global application, that’s correct, yes.
833 This establishes that information travelled up from Australia to the
‘regional level’, ie Ford Asia-Pacific, with
‘expectation’ that it would then travel up to Ford US. It does
not establish that information travelled in the opposite
direction. The second
passage was at T580.15-34:
All right. And this is all being driven out of –
in terms of trying to understand the root cause analysis or do the root cause
analysis in relation to the DPS6 transmission, it’s being driven by Ford
in the US, correct?---Well, Ford in the US was the
lead engineering organisation
for the DPS6 transmission, so they would be the lead entity investigating.
All right. Just with you knowledge of the Ford – the way Ford worked at
the time, there would have been, wouldn’t there,
a pretty free flow of
information both up the chain, by which I mean from Australia to Asia Pac to
Ford US, firstly, correct?---Well,
our – again, from an Australian
perspective, we put all of our data into a repository that could be accessed by,
people in the US, that’s correct.
All right. And it also worked the other way, didn’t it, in that the work
that was being done in the US as to what the root
cause of these problems were,
was also being shared down the line to, for example, the local level in
Australia?---So the normal
process was the lead engineering organisation would
investigate and then subsequently would disseminate information to the markets
that had that particular vehicle, and were – and had that particular
concern. But ultimately the markets would – would
be responsible for the
communication to the local dealers.
834 This suggests that Ford US would investigate and then disseminate
information. I do not accept that this evidence shows that
information held by
Ford US was transferred to the Respondent. Indeed, the examination
continued at T580.39-T581.4:
All right. So what I’m suggesting to you is there
would have been a relatively free flow of information down the chain from
in the US, which would have come down to Asia Pacific and then to Australia, in
relation to the work being done in the US to
diagnosis what was wrong with the
DPS6, that’s correct, isn’t it?
MR SCERRI: Your Honour, could that question be limited to a timeframe?
HIS HONOUR: Mr Pike, can you do that?
MR PIKE: Well, 2012, to start with?---Well, I – I – I can’t
comment on the free-flowing, because I – I’m
not aware of when a
communication may have been issued by the US and, subsequently, when we, at the
market level, received that communication.
835 Mr Karageorgiou’s evidence was that he could not comment on whether
the information was free flowing.
836 The Applicant relied on Mr Cruse’s evidence at T699.6-11, T701.3-4,
T702.3-5, T702.13-17 and T676.39-46. The passage at
T699.6-11 does not assist.
Mr Cruse was being examined about an email sent by a Ford US employee
in 2014 to several persons including
Mr Cruse. It contained an explanation
of the shudder problem. Senior counsel for the Applicant put to Mr Cruse
that this showed
a fairly free flow of information between Ford US and the
Respondent. Mr Cruse replied ‘yes’ but added that it
have been in response [to] my request for a TSB on the subject Mr
Pike’. The passage at T701.3-4 also does not assist. This
cross-examination on an email from the Asia-Pacific division of Ford to
Ford US. Mr Cruse agreed that it showed a free
flow of information
from the Asia-Pacific division and Ford US. That does not prove a free
flow of information from Ford US to the
Respondent. The passages at
T702.3-5 and T702.13-17 do not assist either. Here Mr Cruse was being
cross-examined about an email
sent by Mr Jacobs (a member of Ford Asia-Pacific)
to a number of people about the rear main oil seal issue. Assuming some of
people were at Ford US this does not establish a free flow of
information from Ford US to the Respondent.
837 The final passage was at T676.39-46:
All right. Now, a lot of – I think you’ve
already said, but a lot of work was being done, to your knowledge, by Ford,
lead engineering team in the US, in relation to this; correct?---I knew the lead
engineering activity were – or had been
working the wet issue. As I said,
I was not aware of the dry issue until some time later.
Right. But there was a fair degree of sharing of information, wasn’t
there, from Ford in the US, downstream, to Asia Pacific
and Australia?---Yes, I
would ask our Asia Pacific concern monitoring team as to how our rates of repair
were going.
838 The ‘yes’ does not quite fit with the rest of the answer.
However, I accept that it is some evidence that information
was shared by
Ford US with the Respondent.
839 As to (d), I accept that documents such as a 14D Report generated within
Ford US were available globally and cross-shared. Mr
evidence to this effect at T749.7. I also accept for the reasons I have given
above at Section V that Mr Cruse was probably
aware in April 2012 of a
Ford US document entitled ‘DPS6 Lessons Learned Paper – Summary
of Key Issues for the DPS6 Transmission
Project’. I accept that
Mr Cruse said that he could think of no reason why the relevant team within
Ford US would not share
a 6-Panel Report with the Asia-Pacific and
Australian counterpart teams (T682.13-15). However, he qualified this in the
same answer
to say that he would not ordinarily expect to receive it as part of
the Australian team. I also accept Mr Cruse’s evidence
Ford US provided training information to the Respondent: T635.4-5.
840 The picture then is a little complex. There is some basis for thinking
that once engineering problems and their solutions were
identified by
Ford US they were communicated to the Respondent by means of product
information letters and TSBs. But it also seems
reasonably clear that
information did move from Ford US to the Respondent before these formal
steps. One explanation for this is
likely to be that Ford US needed
information as to how vehicles in the field were actually behaving and that
information could be
obtained from its subsidiaries in the various jurisdictions
including Australia. Most of this happened by email and naturally emails
answered sometimes with further questions and answers. The evidence is replete
with long email chains with recipients from several
different divisions
communicating about particular problems.
841 I therefore do not accept that information about the problems the DPS6
posed were never communicated to the Respondent until a
formal step was taken
such as the issue of a product information letter or TSB. On the other hand, I
do not accept that the evidence
supports the Applicant’s submission at
[559] that once personnel within Ford US identified the root cause of a
problem with
the DPS6 the Respondent became aware of that matter shortly
afterwards. I do not consider that the Applicant has established the
‘free flow’ of information between Ford US and the Respondent
to the extent that the expression suggests that all information
in one found its
way to the other in a reasonably timely fashion. Rather, the evidence suggests
that sometimes information about
a particular problem would make its way to the
Respondent in advance of a formal communique like a product information letter
TSB. However, I do not accept that this was the result of any internal
administrative arrangement or mechanism. Rather, it was
a function of
discussions which from time to time took place. I do accept that the 14D
reports were available by means of a file
sharing arrangement.
842 This conclusion means that unless the material relied upon was a 14D
report or was the particular 6-Panel report to which Mr Cruse
was referring, I
cannot be satisfied that the material was known to the Respondent. I would not
be able to find the opposite either,
that is to say, I cannot find that
information known within Ford US was not known to the Respondent. However,
the Applicant bears
the onus and it is my former inability which determines the
843 Ms Capic’s
individual claim for misleading and deceptive conduct fails.
SECTION XIV: THE GROUP’S AGGREGATE DAMAGES CLAIM
844 Section 33Z(1)(f) of
the FCA Act provides that in determining a matter in a representative proceeding
the Court may, amongst other
things: ‘award damages in an aggregate amount
without specifying amounts awarded in respect of individual group
845 By s 33Z(3) of the FCA Act the Court is not to make such an order unless
‘a reasonably accurate assessment can be made of
the total amount to which
group members will be entitled under the judgment’. I am unpersuaded that
such an order should be
made in this case. The misleading or deceptive conduct
case has failed and may be disregarded (if indeed it had any relevance).
case in question is therefore the failure by the Respondent to comply with the
statutory guarantee under ACL s 54 that required
the vehicles to be of
acceptable quality when supplied. The cause of action is conferred by
ACL s 271(1) which I have dealt with
above at Section XII. As I have
explained there, it cannot yet be known in each case in which the Respondent
replaced the input
shaft seals, the TCM or a B8080 clutch with an RCF1o clutch
whether the repair was performed within a reasonable time. This was
because the
issue of whether repairs to vehicles other than Ms Capic’s were
effected within a reasonable time was not one which
was litigated at the trial.
Accordingly, there are a significant number of group members in respect of whom
it is not known at the
moment whether they in fact continue to have causes of
action for reduction in value damages under ACL s 272(1)(a). In relation
to those group members there could not even be an award of individual damages,
let alone aggregate damages because the continued
existence of their causes of
action for reduction in value damages has not been established in relation to
those proven Component
Deficiencies.
846 Of course, there are group members who do have causes of action under
s 271(1) for reduction in value. These include those whose
cars came with
one or more of the three proven Component Deficiencies and where those problems
have not yet been remedied. It also
includes all group members in relation to
the gear rattling and slight shudder at low speeds caused by the extent of
damping of torsional
vibrations in the DPS6.
847 The Applicant’s case on aggregate damages is based on the idea that
the Affected Vehicles depreciated more rapidly than
relevant comparator vehicles
by reason of the various problems which they had. As knowledge of the problems
permeated the marketplace
it was reflected in decreased resale prices. In a
nutshell, the argument is that the issues with the DPS6 became sufficiently
known that it impacted on the vehicles’ rate of depreciation. The
Applicant therefore seeks on behalf of the group an award
of aggregate damages
to reverse this effect of group-wide excess depreciation. Large numbers are
848 Except in relation to the gear rattling issue and slight shudder at low
speeds associated with inadequate torsional damping (ie
the intersection of what
is left of the Applicant’s architectural deficiencies case and the
‘normal operating characteristics’
asserted by the Respondent) this
assumption of a constant rate of excess depreciation across all Affected
Vehicles is not conceivably
possible because it is not even known for which of
the vehicles there exists which causes of action for reduction in value. In
to the issues of gear rattling and slight shudder at low speeds which
are common to every vehicle because the Respondent submitted
they were normal
operating characteristics, I do not think it would be rational to award the
entire group excess depreciation damages
when it is as plain as a pikestaff that
the depreciation relates to other much more significant issues. The real part
of the Applicant’s
case is not about rattling gears or a slight shudder at
low speeds – it is about the erratic and much more dramatic behaviour
caused by the TCM solder cracks and the problems generated by the leaking input
shaft seals and use of B8080 clutch lining material.
I am not in any way
persuaded that the group-wide excess depreciation now claimed can be sheeted
shudder. Thus whilst every group member
has a cause of action in relation to those issues under no circumstances would I
contemplate
awarding the excess depreciation damages now sought on the basis of
it. To do so would be indefensible.
849 Section 33Z(3) of the FCA Act conditions the exercise of the power
in s 33Z(1)(f) on the possibility of a reasonably accurate
assessment being
made of the ‘total amount’ to which group members will be entitled
under the judgment. As I have explained,
in relation to the input shaft seals,
the B8080 clutch lining and the TCM, the Court does not even know at this stage
which group
members have causes of action for reduction in value and which do
not. In relation to those issues, the question of aggregation
of claims posed
under s 33Z(1)(f) is not enlivened because it is not even known what the
claims are which might be aggregated.
The elaborate debate between the parties
as to whether aggregation was appropriate does not even arise.
850 I note for completeness that the group’s aggregate damages claim
also included amounts for excess finance and tax losses
and repair time costs.
The Applicant’s submissions did not say so expressly but, as in the case
of Ms Capic’s individual
damages claim which I turn to below in
Section XV, I understood these alleged heads of loss to be claimed under
ACL s 272(1)(b).
They therefore represent heads of loss the entitlement to
which is unaffected by ACL s 271(6) and the issue of which group members
continue to have causes of action for reduction in value damages for the three
proven Component Deficiencies. Nonetheless the Court
is not in a position to
award aggregate damages in respect of these alleged heads of loss. There are
two reasons for this:
851 First, FCA Act s 33Z(3) provides that the Court is not to award aggregate
damages ‘unless a reasonably accurate assessment
can be made of the
amount to which group members will be entitled under the
judgment’ (emphasis added). As I have explained, this is not at present
possible because the full picture under ACL s 271(1) and s 271(6) is
not yet known. Even assuming it be possible to arrive at an
assessment of group members’ entitlement to damages under s 272(1)(b) for
excess finance, tax and repair time costs,
this would not be an assessment of
the total amount to which group members are entitled under the judgment.
852 Secondly, even if that be wrong, a proper assessment of any damages for
excess tax and finance losses cannot be made until a group
quantum of reduction in value damages is known. The reasons for this are
explained in Section XV below in connection
with Ms Capic’s
individual claim for damages.
853 I decline to award aggregate damages under s 33Z(1)(f).
SECTION XV: MS CAPIC’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM FOR LOSS AND
The nature of the claims
854 Ms Capic
claims damages from the Respondent under ACL s 271 on the basis that the
vehicle did not comply at the time of its supply
with the guarantee of
acceptable quality. Simplifying her claims at the outset so that they can be
followed she claims these heads
of damages:
Reduction in value damages under
s 272(1)(a)
855 Ms Capic
alleges that she paid $22,736.36 for the vehicle on 24 December 2012 and on that
day the car was not worth that much
because it was afflicted with the Component
and Architectural Deficiencies. That amount is less than the purchase price
particularised
at 4FASOC §3 – I explain later in these reasons why
$22,736.36 is the figure upon which the Applicant now relies. Her
claim is put
in various ways but at its highest would see her receive $12,504 under this
head. I note at this stage that amounts
referred to in this Section of the
reasons do not include pre-judgment interest.
Consequential losses under s 272(1)(b)
856 Ms Capic
alleges that because she paid too much for the vehicle she also paid too much
GST and stamp duty and too much in the
way of finance lease expenses. She also
claims compensation for the time she spent having the vehicle serviced. At most
these claims
are $11,451 for excess financing costs, $378 for stamp duty,
$1,250.40 for GST and $345 for time spent having the car serviced.
Inconvenience, distress and vexation
857 Although
Ms Capic claimed damages for inconvenience, distress and vexation at 4FASOC
§32C she did not pursue this claim in
her closing written submissions.
The causes of action
Input Shaft Seals
858 Ms Capic
has a cause of action in relation to the input shaft seals under s 271(1).
Her vehicle was sold to her with a real risk
that its input shaft seals would
fail causing a range of symptoms including shudder. That risk came to pass. As
I have elsewhere
explained that problem was finally resolved on
30 May 2017 but that was far too late to constitute a repair within
the reasonable
time contemplated in ACL s 271(6). It is, therefore, clear
that Ms Capic continues to have a cause of action under s 271(1).
271(6) is prima facie engaged because repair works were undertaken on
the vehicle but the evidence does not permit the conclusion
that the Respondent
has discharged its burden of demonstrating that the repairs were effective and
implemented within a reasonable
time. Consequently, s 271(6) does not
operate to extinguish Ms Capic’s cause of action in s 271(1).
In any event, as I have
explained elsewhere, s 271(6) only bars a claim for
reduction in value damages under s 272(1)(a); had the proviso been engaged,
would not have precluded Ms Capic’s claim for consequential losses
other than reduction in value. I deal with this in greater
detail below.
859 The Respondent submitted that it was relevant that it resolved this
problem (four and a half years after the vehicle’s purchase)
even if the
repair did not in terms engage s 271(6). At a factual level one may accept
this in the sense that the vehicle no longer
suffers from this problem into the
future. On the other hand, as Ms Capic submits, the same factual palette
would also need to include
the proposition that the vehicle did suffer from the
problem for 4.5 years which is, I accept, a substantial part of its operating
life. For reasons to which I will later come, neither of these submissions
wrestles with the forensic implications which flow from
the fact that
Ms Capic’s case was pitched in terms of risks rather than manifest
symptoms. However, at a factual level I accept
The TCM issue
860 Ms Capic has a
cause of action in relation to the TCM where substantially the same analysis
applies as with the input shaft seals,
with the relevant event occurring on
10 February 2016 when she received a new TCM containing the revised
ATIC 91 chip. As I have
explained above in Section XI, where the
Respondent’s attempt to fix the TCM issue with the 15B22 update is
dependent on the
availability of new TCMs in service and where it has not led
any evidence to show that they were in fact available for Ms Capic’s
vehicle prior to February 2016, I cannot conclude that the installation of the
software update was an effective repair for the purposes
of s 271(6). However,
even if 15B22 had been an effective fix in Ms Capic’s case, it would
not affect the result because the
software update could not extinguish
Ms Capic’s cause of action in relation to this problem having
occurred nearly three years
after the date of purchase (and thus outside a
reasonable time).
The replacement of B8080
861 Ms Capic does
not need to confront the question of reasonable time under s 271(6) in the
case of the replacement of her clutch.
For the reasons I have given, the switch
from the B8080 clutch to the half-hybrid B8040/B8080 clutch has not been shown
been effective. Consistent therewith I have accepted
Ms Capic’s evidence that even after the clutch replacement on
2017 the vehicle has continued to misbehave. The repair not
being shown to be effective, s 271(6) is irrelevant. In the case of
deficiency, it was present when the vehicle was sold (with a B8080 clutch) and
the switch to a half-hybrid clutch has not resolved
the issue. For its entire
life the vehicle has not been of acceptable quality because of its clutch
The rattling gears and the slight shudder at low
862 I have accepted the
element of the Applicant’s architectural deficiencies case which consists
of these two issues (which
were also said by the Respondent to be normal
operating characteristics). The vehicle was not of acceptable quality for this
at the time of its acquisition and remains so. No issue as to
s 271(6) arises since no repair has been attempted.
863 It follows that Ms Capic is entitled to damages under both limbs of
s 272(1) for the input shaft seals, the clutch lining, the
TCM and the
rattling gears and slight shudder caused by the inadequate damping of torsional
vibrations.
Reduction in value damages
864 Although a case was initially advanced based on
the excess depreciation theory underpinning the aggregate damages case,
accepted that if aggregate damages were not awarded then resort
should not be had to the evidence of Mr Stockton for assessing any
reduction in value in her vehicle (although she did submit that
Mr Stockton’s formula for pre-judgment interest should be applied
the reduction in value as assessed by Mr Vasilakis, which is not presently
material). Mr Stockton’s evidence about excess
depreciation (and
Dr Strombom’s in response) may therefore be disregarded for present
purposes since no award of aggregate
damages is to be made. Mr Stockton
has some residual relevance to the claims made for some of the consequential
losses to which
I will return.
Mr Vasilakis
865 Ms Capic led
evidence from a car valuer, Mr Vasilakis as to the reduction in value her
car suffered. This was done on two bases.
The first was on the assumption that
the vehicle suffered from all four of the Component Deficiencies together with
the Architectural
Deficiencies, the second on the basis that it suffered only
from the four Component Deficiencies. Mr Vasilakis valued the vehicle
at the date of its acquisition, 24 December 2012.
866 I have not accepted the case based on the rear main oil seal, one of the
four alleged Component Deficiencies which Mr Vasilakis
was instructed to
assume existed. Further, although Mr Vasilakis assumed that the clutch
lining issue had eventually been resolved,
this is not what I have found. To
that extent both of Mr Vasilakis’ valuations have been done on a
basis which does not quite
match the facts. Further, insofar as the
Architectural Deficiencies case is concerned I have accepted very little of it.
not accepted that inadequate heat management adds anything to the issue
with the clutch lining material. Although I have accepted
a part of the
torsional vibration case, I have done so only in relation to gear rattling and a
slight shudder at low speeds. It
is apparent that Mr Vasilakis was asked
to assume a range of symptoms associated with the Architectural Deficiencies
case greater
than those which I have found, ie, erratic gear shifts and a lack
867 In his first report dated 18 December 2019 he assessed the reduction
in value by reference to both the Component and Architectural
Deficiencies as
the difference between the fair market value of the vehicle at the time of its
acquisition without the defects and
its fair market value with those defects.
Given my conclusions on the Architectural Deficiencies I do not think that the
assumptions
on which Mr Vasilakis’ opinion is based are sufficiently
close to reality to make it useful.
868 Mr Vasilakis also prepared a second report dated 8 April 2020
on the basis that the vehicle only suffered from the Component Deficiencies.
The assumptions included one Component Deficiency which I have not accepted as
having been proved (rear main oil seal) and excluded
as having been resolved one
Component Deficiency which the Respondent has not shown was resolved (clutch
869 On this basis he assessed the fair market value of the vehicle as at the
date of its acquisition on the assumption that it had
no defects as being the
same as the price paid for it, $22,736.36. He assessed its value with the
Component Deficiency as being
60%-70% of its fair market value without them, ie,
$13,641.82 to $15,915.45. Mr Vasilakis did not explain how he arrived at
view in any great detail. His reasoning was at §§31-34:
In my First Report, I explained that the most valuable
years of a car’s life occur at the beginning of its life. I noted in
paragraph 38 of my First Report my opinion that about 40% of the value of a car
like Ms Capic’s would usually expire within
the first 4 years of its life.
As I note above, fixes were not available for any of the Component Deficiencies
until at least about
3 years after Ms Capic bought the Car, and the problems
with the seals and the friction material were not fixed until about 4.5 years
after the date of purchase.
Based on my experience, consumers would insist on a very substantial discount on
account of the Component Deficiencies, considering
their potential and actual
impact on the Car’s performance, comfort, reliability, durability and
safety. That discount would
take into account that the Car is prone to shudder,
have erratic gear shifts, gear selection problems, lack of power or response,
and excessive noise. It would also take into account that the car might be hard
to sell, expensive to maintain and inconvenient compared
to other options on the
Based on my experience, I would estimate the fair market value of Ms
Capic’s car, at the Time of the Supply, with the Component
Deficiencies
(and not with the Architectural Deficiencies) to be about 60% to 70% of the fair
market value of that car without those
defects. That is, $13,641.82-$15,915.45
(excl GST). In reaching that conclusion, I have assumed that the cost of the
repairs required
to address the Component Deficiencies would be covered by
Accordingly, I assess the reduction in value to be between $6,820.91 and
$9,094.54 (ex GST), or $7,957.72 (ex GST) at its
870 The Respondent submitted that Mr Vasilakis’ opinion was not
useful because he did not explain his process of reasoning and
seems to have
engaged in an ‘intuitive’ valuation. There is some substance to
this contention although in valuation
cases it often loses much of its force.
In such cases, the final step usually involves the application of judgment
following a review
of relevant matters. However, I do accept that I would need
to adjust Mr Vasilakis’ opinion to take account of the disjunct
between his assumptions and the facts as found. Unfortunately, I do not see how
I can do this for inasmuch as I accept Mr Vasilakis’
capacity to
perform the necessary evaluative exercise I am not sure that I could simulate
that exercise on the facts as found. Regardless
of whether §§31-34
are sufficient from an evidentiary perspective they are not sufficient from the
practical perspective
of seeking to recalibrate them to reflect the different
factual situation which has been found.
871 Before turning to how Ms Capic’s damages might be assessed in
that circumstance, it is necessary to attend in some detail
to the purchase of
the vehicle.
The purchase of the vehicle
872 I have dealt with
this above at Section V but reproduce those conclusions in a more summary
form in this section. The evidence
includes an invoice addressed to her seeking
payment of $28,595.00. The finance lease she then entered into with BMW Finance
that she financed that purchase by means of a chattel lease under which
she agreed to pay $586.09 per month on the 24
day of the month for
four years and to pay a residual payment at the end of the lease of $12,839.20.
As I have previously noted,
the $664.73 gap between the amount due to BMW
Finance and the amount due to Sterling Ford is not explained on the evidence.
evidence shows that the lease payments were in fact met by her then employer
until August 2016 when it went into administration.
Her new employer then
took over the repayments including the arrears until the lease expired on 24
December 2016. Ms Capic did
not meet her obligation to pay the residual of
$12,839.20 until 29 May 2017 when she entered into a second finance lease for
amount of the residual. I have noted the possibility that there may have
been a third finance lease which replaced the second lease
but have not been
able to resolve that issue. The monthly payments under this lease (of which
there were 36) were $368.18. There
was an obligation to pay a residual of
$6,355.40 on 29 May 2020. Her then employer met the monthly rental payments
until 30 November
2017. After that she was obliged to meet them herself. She
appears to have fallen into arrears for a period but eventually to have
and paid the residual on 29 May 2020.
873 The invoice which was issued for the purchase of the car by Sterling Ford
is summarised above at Section V. It shows the purchase
price for the car
was $24,542.27 (excluding GST). However, it includes a charge for delivery by
the dealer of $1,540.91 which does
not in my opinion form part of the purchase
price. When that is deducted the figure becomes $23,001.36. Ms Capic says
in her submissions
that she paid $22,736.36 which differs by $265. That
difference is represented by a charge of $200 for window tinting and $65 for
carpet mats which she has excluded from her claim. For myself I would have
included them as part of the purchase price of the vehicle,
Ms Capic did not approach it that way and I will not do so either. Thus
the pre-GST purchase price was $22,736.36.
874 The dealer paid GST (as the supplier) and stamp duty and some other
charges which it sought to recover under the invoice. Together
purchase price (including dealer delivery) these added up to the $28,595.00 to
which I have referred.
875 It may be inferred that there was a contract of purchase between
Ms Capic and Sterling Ford under which she agreed to purchase
and it agreed
to sell her the vehicle together with some other items (including GST and stamp
duty) for the amount of the invoice.
Ms Capic discharged the monetary
obligation created by this agreement by procuring BMW Finance to pay the sum of
$28,595. It advanced
that sum in return for her promise to meet the monthly
repayments and pay the residual at the end of the lease.
876 It was not suggested by either party that the vehicle had not been
registered in Ms Capic’s name. The registration papers
which are in
evidence show that it was registered in her name. Indeed, the Respondent has
always treated her as the owner. It is
unclear whether the various finance
companies registered a security interest in the vehicle, although
Mr Cuthbert’s report
contained a screenshot of a PPSR search which
seemed to indicate this was at least done by Macquarie Leasing Pty Ltd. Indeed,
is unclear what the terms of the leases were (or at least the initial one)
and neither party took me to them.
How much did Ms Capic pay for the vehicle?
877 Although at one time
Ms Capic pursued a case that the amount she had paid for the vehicle was
the total of the amounts paid under
the first finance lease ($40,971.52) this
case was not pursued in final submissions. The amount she claimed as the
purchase price
was $22,736.36 and I accept this.
878 The Respondent submitted at [366] that because her employers had met the
rental payments under both leases until November 2017
Ms Capic had not paid
the total amount of the invoice. I do not accept this submission. The payment
of the invoice by BMW Australia
(no doubt at Ms Capic’s direction)
discharged Ms Capic’s monetary obligation to Sterling Ford and was
accordingly a payment
by her. This is well-established: see my own remarks in
Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Rozman
[2010] FCA 324
and those of Leeming JA in
Capital Securities XV Pty Ltd v
[2018] NSWCA 26
, Basten JA agreeing at [1] and
Gleeson JA agreeing at [2]. In any event, it is unclear whether in making this
submission the Respondent
was contending that Ms Capic had not purchased
the vehicle. If it was making such a submission I reject it. Ms Capic had
obligations under the leases to make the rental payments. The fact
that A is obliged to pay B but that obligation is acquitted by
a payment by C to
B does not mean, for the reasons I have just given, that A has not made the
payment. The fact that it is A’s
monetary obligation which is discharged
permits of no other answer. It is for this reason that a person who borrows the
price for a house from a bank still purchases the house even though, on
the day, the funds come from the bank.
879 A variant of this argument pursued by the Respondent at [403] was that
the finance costs under the leases were met by her employers
until November
2017. This submission is related to the question of whether Ms Capic can
recover excess finance costs on the basis
that she paid too much for the car. I
employers met
her lease payments has any impact unless it is shown that they did
so as a gift. However, I do not conclude that they did so gratuitously.
employment arrangements clearly included her employer making the lease payments
as part of an overall salary package. As such
these payments were not
gratuities.
Mr Cuthbert’s evidence as to the value of the
880 I also reject the
Respondent’s own valuation evidence. This came from Mr Cuthbert who
in his report dated 11 March 2020
assessed the current market value
(excluding exterior damage) of Ms Capic’s vehicle to be $11,000 in
January 2020. But that
is the wrong question. The correct question is what the
value was when she purchased it. No doubt, it is true to say as the Respondent
did at [372] that evidence of current market value is ‘of considerable
utility ... because any assessment of loss suffered
at the date of supply must
have regard to subsequent events’. But its considerable utility does not
extend to overcoming a
complete absence of any evidence as to what the value
actually was at the date of acquisition.
881 The use to which the Respondent put Mr Cuthbert’s evidence was
instead to apply that ‘considerable utility’
not to any valuation at
24 December 2012 which he had conducted, but as an instrument to criticise
Mr Vasilakis’ evidence.
This it did by pointing out that the value
Mr Vasilakis placed on the vehicle on 24 December 2012 on the assumption
that it had
both sets of the deficiencies alleged by Ms Capic was less than
the value Mr Cuthbert placed on the vehicle in January 2020. This
longer matters since I have not relied on this aspect of
Mr Vasilakis’ evidence but was, in any event, unpersuasive.
Cuthbert was not asked to assume that the vehicle suffered from any
defects. Instead he was asked to value the vehicle on the basis
inspection, documents evidencing the vehicle’s service history and
Mr Carter’s report that the vehicle was
mechanically sound and
operated normally. Through no fault of Mr Carter’s, however, I have
not accepted that to be so. Mr
Cuthbert’s evidence is irrelevant
because his assumptions do not match the facts and because he was asked the
wrong question.
882 Consequently, there is no useful evidence about the fair market value of
Ms Capic’s vehicle on 24 December 2012 on the assumption
suffered from the risks of failure I have found that it did.
883 Be that as it may, I am quite satisfied that Ms Capic’s
vehicle was worth less at the time of its acquisition than she paid
Mr Vasilakis gave evidence to this effect which was not contradicted but in
any event it is to my mind obvious. How should
the reduction in value damages
be assessed? It is trite that ‘mere difficulty in estimating damages does
not relieve a court
from the responsibility of estimating them’ and
‘[w]here precise evidence is not available the court must do the best

884 The process of assessing what the value of a chattel was 9 years in the
past when the defects it suffered from are risks not actualities
is inherently
impressionistic. That the risks came to pass is, so it seems to me, not to the
point. If it were otherwise the value
at the date of acquisition would be
conceptually tied to contingent future events and hence theoretically
unknowable. The fact that
the vehicle’s input shaft seals did fail does
not, therefore, matter. But for the same reason, the fact that the Respondent
replaced them does not matter either for neither bears upon the risk of failure
which existed at the date of the acquisition. The
risks of the three proven
component failures Ms Capic faced on 24 December 2012 were not altered in
their extent when they came to
pass just as a person who wins the lottery cannot
be said to have had a 100% chance of winning. They had the same chance as
else: the outcome of a probabilistic event does not affect the original
probability.
885 Identical remarks may be made about the TCM. In the case of the clutch
lining the same analysis flows albeit with a slight twist.
That the risk came
off that the clutch lining would behave erratically is irrelevant to the value
at the time of its acquisition
for the reasons just given. It is thus also
irrelevant that it was
successfully repaired (whereas in the case of
the TCM and input shafts seals what is irrelevant is that they
886 In a sense, the Applicant makes this very submission on behalf of group
members when she submits that group members with vehicles
which have never
displayed any symptoms are equally entitled to recover. The Applicant’s
position on this issue is an inevitable
corollary of running the case on the
basis of a risk of symptoms rather than actual symptoms.
887 Ms Capic’s vehicle came with a real risk that:
(a) the input shaft seals would fail resulting in oil
contamination of the clutch plate surface in turn causing wet clutch
(b) the solder connecting the ATIC 91 chip to the PCB in the TCM would
progressively crack giving rise to an increasing array of
problems starting with
loss of power for a few milliseconds (which might be imperceptible or
experienced as a brief shuddering sensation)
and ending with a total loss of
motive power for a period of seconds;
(c) the clutch lining material would exhibit negative damping causing it to
behave unpredictably resulting in self-excited shudder
and geometric
misalignment in the clutch components would cause forced-excited shudder; and
(d) torsional vibrations would be transmitted from the crankshaft through the
drivetrain resulting in gear rattling and a slight
shudder at low
888 I assess the risk of (d) as high since the Respondent described it as a
normal operating characteristic but I would also describe
the occurrence of the
risk as not as dramatic as (a) to (c).
889 I disregard the offer made by Jefferson Ford on 10 February 2016 to
purchase the vehicle for $10,000. Whilst it appears that
Ms Capic told the
dealer the problems she had with the vehicle, again, this invites the wrong
question which is about the value of
a chattel attended by risks of failure at
the date of purchase rather than the value of the chattel given the occurrence
of the risks
or some of them.
890 Taking these matters into account, I have concluded that
Ms Capic’s vehicle was worth 30% less than its fair market value
without any defect on the day that she purchased it. I accept that its fair
market value on 24 December 2012 without defects was
the amount she
paid for it, $22,736.36 and I assess her reduction in value damages at
$6,820.91. This is the amount which, if tendered
to her on 24 December 2012,
would have put her in the position she would have been in if the guarantee of
acceptable quality had
been complied with at least in a balance sheet sense (ie
expectation damages). I will order pursuant to s 51A(1)(a) of the FCA Act
that there be interest up to judgment on that sum from
24 December 2012 at 4% above the official cash rate published by the
Bank of Australia, calculated monthly but without compounding.
Consequential losses
GST, stamp duty and financing costs
891 Ms Capic
claimed to be entitled to be put in the position she would have been in if she
had in fact paid only for what the car
was worth having regard to its defects
– as it has fallen out, that is 70% of the price she did pay or
$15,915.45. In that
counterfactual, so she argues, she would have paid 30% less
GST, stamp duty and financing costs. She claims these losses under
272(1)(b). As Edelman J has observed in relation to the similar
provisions of the ACL (s 267(3) and s 267(4)), s 272(1)(a) and
272(1)(b) resemble the two components of compensatory damages available
at common law for breach of contract:
Moore v Scenic Tours Pty Ltd
94 ALJR 481
. These two components are (1) compensation
directly for the performance interest and (2) compensation for consequential
which is bounded in the same manner as at common law by the second limb
of the rule in
Hadley v Baxendale
(1854) 156 ER 145: see also
Nominees Pty Ltd v LeRoi International Inc (No 2)
[2015] WASCA 35
per Buss JA in relation to the
Sale of Goods Act 1895
This might suggest that the point of the award was to put
Ms Capic in the position she would have been in if the vehicle had been
acceptable quality. That view of s 272(1) would suggest that although it is a
statutory cause of action it takes its cue from
familiar provisions in sale of
goods legislation dating back to the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (UK) elegantly
drafted by Sir Mackenzie
Chalmers, remnants of which even now may be perceived,
fresco-like, under the crude graffiti of the ACL. The implied term that goods
will be of merchantable quality was imposed by Chalmers’ statute and the
measure of damages was the contractual one, namely,
expectation damages –
the plaintiff was to be put in the position she would have been if the term had
been complied with.
892 If the point of an award of reduction in value damages is to put
Ms Capic in the position she would have been if she had paid
$15,915.45 for
a vehicle worth that much then one may readily accept that she has paid too much
for these various charges and they
should, on a pro rata basis, be reimbursed to
her by the Respondent. On the other hand, if the point of the award of
reduction in
value damages is to place her in the position she would have been
if the vehicle had been worth $22,736.36 then the opposite result
because, on that view, she has paid the correct amounts of GST, stamp duty and
financing costs. The difference between these
two approaches is the difference
between awarding reduction in value damages, on the one hand, for paying too
much for what was actually
obtained and, on the other, obtaining too little for
what was actually paid. In both cases the primary figure is clear –
– but in one case this amount represents the extent of an
overpayment (to be refunded) and in the other the extent of an under-delivery
(to be compensated for with an award of expectation damages).
893 In my view the identification of the purpose served by an award of
reduction in value damages potentially impacts upon the kinds
of losses which
may be recovered as consequential losses under s 272(1)(b). What is
causally connected to an overpayment which is
to be refunded is not necessarily
the same as that which is causally connected to an under-delivery which is to be
compensated for.
The expression ‘reduction in value’ damages
suggests to me that it is the latter which may be the correct approach
894 However, so characterising the issue only generates further questions.
If, as I apprehend, the question of consequential loss
is to be approached on an
expectation basis then this requires the identification of a state of affairs to
which the plaintiff is
to be restored. It is natural to think that there is
only one of these but theoretically there may be more. In this case, it would
be possible to acquit Ms Capic’s entitlement to be put in the position she
would have been if the vehicle had been of acceptable
quality in at least three
(a) she could hand back her vehicle and be given a 2012
Ford Focus which has done the same mileage as her vehicle (with the Respondent
meeting any transfer costs) but which is defect-free;
(b) she could retain her current vehicle but be given $6,820.91 worth of a
defect-free 2012 Ford Focus with similar mileage –
perhaps from the boot
to somewhere in the back seats (obviously this is practically impossible but it
serves a useful illustrative
purpose); and
(c) she could retain her vehicle and be awarded $6,820.91 cash as at 24 December
2012 together with an award of interest up to
895 These three scenarios lead to different outcomes on the question of
consequential loss. It is clear that in (a), it would lead
to overcompensation
if she were awarded the GST, stamp duty and financing costs she has incurred.
On this hypothesis, she will have
been placed in precisely the position she
would have occupied if the Respondent had originally met its obligations under
that position always entailed payment of the amounts of GST, stamp
duty and financing costs in fact paid.
896 The approach in (b) most likely leads to the same outcome.
897 The approach in (c) is in fact the consequence of the award of reduction
in value damages to which I have concluded Ms Capic is
entitled. This is a less
than perfect version of what her position would have been if s 54 had been
complied with and is mired with
real world difficulties. In this imperfect
world Ms Capic has received a car worth $15,915.45 and received $6,820.91 in
reduction in value damages. Yet she has paid GST, stamp duty and excess
financing costs on the basis that the vehicle was worth
$22,736.36. The award
of reduction in value damages is incapable of putting her in the precise
position she would have been if the
guarantee had been complied with because the
award of reduction in value damages is not a perfect tool for achieving that
Not to award her as consequential damages the excess GST, stamp duty
and financing costs would leave her out of pocket because the
vehicle she has
was not worth the purchase price and because the award of $6,820.91 in cash does
not generate a liability in her
hands to pay GST, stamp duty or finance costs.
Consequently, on this view, the excess GST, stamp duty and finance costs are
recoverable.
898 The question then becomes which of these scenarios should be selected as
the state of affairs upon which a calculation of expectation
damages is to be
based. Common sense suggests that it should be scenario (c) which is, in fact,
the fruits of the Court’s
imperfect efforts to achieve compliance with s
54. To choose (a) and (b) would be theoretically pure but also unreal when it
known that is not how the expectation generated by s 54 has been met.
Whether s 272(1) is to be approached on such a basis and whether,
these excess imposts and financing costs are recoverable is, to my mind, the
most interesting question in this case. Neither
party made any submissions
unfair to act on that conclusion
without hearing from Ms Capic. However, in
circumstances where I have rejected an argument which could have been put by the
(but was not) I do not think the same problem arises.
899 The Respondent, while not framing the question in the way I have just
done, submitted that these charges could not be recovered
for three, maybe four
reasons. As will be shortly seen, the identification of the purpose of an award
of damages under s 272(1)
cannot really be disaggregated from the submissions
the Respondent does actually make.
900 The first related to a suggestion that the claims were not pleaded. This
was certainly said at [398]-[399] of the Respondent’s
submissions. At
[400] the Respondent then said ‘Leaving to one side the fact that the
Applicant’s excess finance and
tax costs loss is not pleaded ... it is
submitted that such loss is not recoverable in any event, because...’ and
follow the other three reasons for resisting the claim.
901 One begins therefore with the task of construing what the Respondent
meant by the words ‘Leaving to one side’. I
do not read that as a
waiver of the objection. To make one point leaving another point to one side is
to make an alternative argument
on the assumption, contrary to the argument,
that the first point is not accepted. Thus it seems to me the pleading issue is
902 At 4FASOC §31 the Applicant claimed on her own behalf and on behalf
of group members damages under s 271 for the Respondent’s
comply with the guarantee in s 54. It is in these terms:
By reason of the failure to comply with the guarantee
imposed by s 54 of the ACL, the Applicant and Guarantee Subgroup Members
entitled under s 271 of the ACL to recover damages from Ford
903 At §31AA she alleged certain losses were reasonably foreseeable:
(a) costs of acquiring Affected Vehicles;
(b) devaluation of Affected Vehicles;
(c) costs of inspecting Affected Vehicles;
(d) costs of returning the Affected Vehicles for servicing, repair or
replacement;
(e) costs of servicing of, or repairs to, the Affected Vehicles;
(f) costs of replacement car hire (including taxi fares) incurred in respect of
periods during which the Affected Vehicles were not
able to be used;
(g) wages and income lost in respect of periods during which the Affected
Vehicles were not able to be used;
(h) additional financing costs in respect of the Affected Vehicles;
(i) additional stamp duty and dealer delivery charges in respect of the Affected
Vehicles; and
(j) damages for inconvenience, distress and vexation.
904 It seems to me that the Applicant claimed damages under s 271 and
s 272 and alleged that the stamp duty cost was reasonably foreseeable.
would read §31 and §31AA(i) as sufficient to raise the claim for stamp
duty. The Respondent did not draw §31AA
to my attention. Instead it
pointed to §36:
The Applicant claims, in her own right and on behalf of
the Group Members, the relief specified in the application, namely:
(i) declaratory relief as to the conduct of Ford Australia in contravention of
(ii) damages pursuant to s 236 of the ACL;
(iii) damages pursuant to s 271 and 272 of the ACL;
(iv) damages, including, but not limited to, diminution in value of the Affected
Vehicle(s), any amounts paid for repairs, car hire,
taxi fares, additional
finance costs and any additional expenses and costs incurred as a result of the
necessity to replace the Affected
Vehicle and obtain a different vehicle;
(v) in the alternative to (i) to (iv) above, pursuant to s 33Z(1)(f), an award
of damages in an aggregate amount;
(vii) interest;
(vii) Costs ; and
(viii) such other orders as the Court thinks fit.
905 That puts the matter beyond doubt in the case of stamp duty – the
only residual doubt I had about this was whether it could
truly be said that the
Applicant had claimed damages in §31 but §36 is certainly such a
claim. Further, it is clear that
§36(iv) involves a claim for additional
finance costs. It is true that it is separate from the claim for damages under
and s 272 but I do not read the sub-paragraphs as exclusive of
each other (except (v) which is expressed to be in the alternative).
906 That leaves the GST. By a letter providing further particulars dated 1
July 2020 the Applicant provided particulars of a claim
for GST. This was said
to be by way of further particulars to §36(ii)-(iv). In my opinion, that
was sufficient to include
the claim for GST. The particulars make clear what
the submissions do not, that there are two claims for GST – one on the
vehicle and one on the rental payments.
907 I am satisfied that the two claims for GST, stamp duty and finance costs
are within the pleaded case.
908 Turning then to the other reasons the Respondent resisted the claims,
these were three.
909 The first was that the asserted losses were not reasonably foreseeable
and hence did not satisfy the requirements of s 272(1)(b).
The second was
that they did not satisfy s 272(3). The third was that they had not been
suffered by Ms Capic but represented costs
paid by her employers.
910 The first argument presents an interesting conundrum. It seems obvious
that it is reasonably foreseeable that if one supplies
a vehicle which has
inherent risks of failure such that it is worth less than the amount it is sold
for, the person to whom it is
sold will end up paying more GST and stamp duty
than they would have if the vehicle had been sold at its true value. The GST
stamp duty are unavoidable transaction costs which makes their
foreseeability that much easier to appreciate. Car finance is not
but it is such a common incident of the purchase of vehicles that it can, I
think, be put in the same category and, along
with it, any GST paid in respect
of such a finance lease.
911 But this superficially straightforward analysis conceals a difficulty.
As I have explained, Ms Capic’s claim may be characterised
a claim that she paid too much for what she received (the overpayment
characterisation) or that she received less than
what the Respondent promised to
deliver (the under-delivery characterisation). Thus, the effect of the award of
damages under s
272(1)(a) may be characterised either as a reimbursement
for an overpayment or the belated delivery of that which ought to have been
was not delivered at the time of supply (to put it crudely, $6,820.91 worth of
car). If one takes the second characterisation,
Ms Capic will end up in
the position where she received exactly what she bargained for. How then can
the amounts paid for GST, stamp
duty and finance costs represent a loss, where
the bargained-for position always entailed payment of precisely those amounts?
an additional award to cover those sums not represent double recovery?
912 The answer is that the overpayment characterisation and not the
under-delivery characterisation is that which best accords with
principle. Once Ms Capic recovers $6,820.91, her position will be that of
someone who paid $15,915.45 for a car which,
including its defects, was worth
exactly that. But that was not the car on which she paid GST, stamp duty and
financing costs.
Those amounts were paid on and by reference to a car which,
defect free, was worth $22,736.36. And, the $6,820.91 she will now receive
not exigible to GST or stamp duty and has no impact on what her financing costs
actually were. The proper characterisation is
that the excess amounts of tax
and finance were reasonably foreseeable and, subject to the Respondent’s
second and third arguments
to which I will shortly turn, are recoverable under
s 272(1)(b).
913 I do not accept the second argument. Section 272(3) provides:
Subsection (1)(b) does not apply to loss or damage
suffered through a reduction in the value of the goods.
914 The Respondent submitted that Ms Capic’s claims were
‘tied to the (allegedly overpriced) value of the vehicle’.
can catch just a glimpse of the problem I have adverted to above about
expectation damages. The Respondent’s submissions
may refer to
Ms Capic’s damages claim as being one of having paid an overprice but
that is not the language of s 272(3). To
fall within it the losses must be
‘suffered through’ the reduction in the value of the goods. The
fact that the imposts
and financing costs were paid on the purchase price rather
than on the true value of the vehicle makes it difficult to see how they
‘suffered through’ the reduction in value. ‘Suffered
through’ is an expression which connotes a relationship
of causation. In
most contexts, there is more to causation than satisfaction of the ‘but
for’ test. And, as has often
been pointed out, where there are two
sufficient causes (A and B) for an event C, the application of the but for test
leads to the
anomalous result that neither A nor B is causative of C. Even so,
I think it is instructive in this case that the excess GST, stamp
financing costs would still have been incurred if there had not been a reduction
in the value of Ms Capic’s vehicle.
That is a further reason for
concluding that they have not been ‘suffered through’ the reduction
in value for the purposes
of s 272(3).
915 The third argument was that Ms Capic had not suffered these losses
herself because they had been paid by her employer. I have
dealt with this
argument above at [878] by rejecting it.
916 In that circumstance, I accept that the Applicant has demonstrated that
she is entitled to recover from the Respondent excess
amounts of GST, stamp duty
and financing costs having regard to the position she now finds herself in: (a)
owning a vehicle for which
she paid $22,736.36 on 24 December 2012 which was
worth at that time $15,915.45; (b) being awarded $6,820.91 in reduction in value
damages; and (c) being awarded interest between 24 December 2012 and the date of
judgment. In that situation, Ms Capic is out of
pocket if she is not awarded
these excess amounts. The excess finance costs carry with them excess GST paid
by Ms Capic on her rental
payments which, for completeness, I also accept were
reasonably foreseeable
917 Ms Capic relied upon the evidence of Mr Stockton to calculate
these amounts. However, the reduction in value amounts upon which
calculated are not the same as the one upon which I have proceeded ($6,820.91)
so they are of no use for present purposes.
Working out what the figures are as
a result of these conclusions involves minor numerical work and no further
evidence. For example,
the excess amount of GST is $682.09. It seems that
excess amount of stamp duty would be $204.63. The reworking of the finance
on the assumption that the initial purchase price was $15,915.45 is a
more involved exercise but does not involve anything more difficult
calculation under a hire purchase agreement using the same rates as under the
leases which were in fact in place. Of course,
this will impact on the
residuals and these will need to be adjusted too.
918 For completeness, I reject the Respondent’s submission at [404]
that damages for excess financing costs should not be awarded
in relation to the
second finance lease. Here the argument was that by the time this lease had
been entered into Ms Capic had already
commenced this proceeding and
therefore knew what the problems with the car were. The Respondent submitted
that it was well-established
that a buyer of defective goods cannot obtain
damages for consequential losses after the defect has been discovered because to
so would be to incur costs at the risk of the seller. I accept that this
principle exists but not that it has anything to do with
this case. The issue
here is whether the loss under the second finance lease is of a reasonably
foreseeable kind. In my view, and
subject to my general criticism of this
approach to damages, it plainly is. Ms Capic only entered the second lease
because of the
Repair time
919 Ms Capic claims
$345 for time spent obtaining repairs. To obtain this figure Mr Stockton
used Google Maps to derive the route
between Ms Capic’s home and the
Ford dealer to whom she took the vehicle for servicing. From this he derived
the round-trip
drive time to which he added 10 minutes spent waiting for
alternative transportation to be arranged and 6 minutes of total transaction
time with the service department. He applied a 50% time discount in instances
where non-DPS6 related repairs also occurred on the
visit on the basis that only
half of the work done related to the DPS6. He then applied to that time
estimate the average hourly
wage rate for Ms Capic’s postal code to
obtain the figure of $345.
920 I am not satisfied that there is any basis for Mr Stockton’s
decision to apply a 50% discount to reflect the fact that not
all issues related
to the DPS6 on visits where there were other repairs. I am not satisfied that
Ms Capic is entitled to any compensation
for an ordinary scheduled service,
even if there ended up being DPS6 related repairs performed. For example, I was
not taken to
any evidence to the effect that this DPS6 related work meant that
these ordinary scheduled services took longer than they otherwise
921 Whilst I accept that Ms Capic lost at least some time when taking
her vehicle in for unscheduled services, she has not led any
evidence to
establish that this caused her to suffer a loss that equates to the average wage
earnt across that time period. There
was no evidence of whether these services
necessitated her taking time off from work or whether she would have spent this
time otherwise
earning income.
922 I am not satisfied of the sense of using wages derived from postcodes
when Ms Capic’s actual salary is known (noting that
Mr Stockton did
calculate what the figure would be on such a basis but that this was not the
figure sought by Ms Capic in her written
submissions). This approach may have
more credence when looking at aggregate damages across the group but in
Ms Capic’s case
it asks me to ignore known facts. In those
circumstances, I do not think it appropriate to award this element.
Damages for inconvenience, distress and vexation
923 Although claimed in
the 4FASOC at §32C particular 2, Ms Capic did not develop any
submissions about this matter. I make

Respondent submits that the Applicant should not be permitted to rely on 84

Case No.2:12-cv-08388-AB (FFMx) (‘
was filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California. I
shall refer to the documents produced by Ford US to
the District Court as the
‘§1782 documents’. The Respondent submitted that there are
approximately 330,000 of these
927 It is useful first to deal with the position of the Schedule 1 documents
which are drawn from the §1782 documents.
Schedule 1 documents drawn from the §1782
928 The Applicant seeks
to rely upon these documents to prove one or more of the defects she alleges in
§6AB of the 4FASOC.
The demonstration of those defects is an important
step towards the allegation she makes at §29(1) and §29(2) that the
class vehicles were not of acceptable quality within the meaning of s 54 of the
929 The Respondent submits that it would be procedurally unfair for the Court
to permit the Applicant to rely upon these documents
to prove those defects. An
assessment of that proposition calls for an examination of the way in which the
case has been pleaded
and run by the Applicant. For each of the defects alleged
in §6AB the Applicant has provided particulars in the pleading.
cases the pleading indicates that the Applicant will rely on admissions made by
the Respondent in other proceedings, in others
reliance is placed upon an
affidavit sworn by a Ford US employee in the US proceedings. Other particulars
are provided also.
930 However, the subscribed particulars to §6AB make no reference to the
expert evidence of Dr Greiner. It is clear nevertheless
that the Applicant
ran her case on the basis that the way in which she sought to make good the
defects allegations in §6AB was
on the basis of Dr Greiner’s
evidence. This is so for two reasons: (a) a letter dated 30 August 2019 from
the Applicant’s
solicitors to the Respondent’s solicitors explained
that the way she would prove at least some of the alleged defects would
means of the expert testimony of Dr Greiner (this is in the electronic Court
Book under ‘particulars’); and, (b)
the way the trial was conducted
centred on the evidence of Dr Greiner. In terms, the case put and met was that
the vehicles suffered
from the four Component Deficiencies and the two
Architectural Deficiencies.
931 As a matter of procedure, therefore, it is apparent that Dr
Greiner’s reports served the purpose both of providing the Respondent
the particulars of how §6AB would be proved and also the evidence to make
good that proof. Consequently, Dr Greiner’s
evidence provides the metes
and bounds of the dispute between the parties.
932 The result is this case is an example of the principle that parties may
jointly choose to conduct their case on a basis other
than that formally alleged
in the pleadings:
Gould v Mount Oxide Mines Ltd (in liq)
[1916] HCA 81
(1916) 22 CLR
at 517 per Isaacs and Rich JJ;
Banque Commerciale SA, En Liquidation v
Akhil Holdings Ltd
(1990) 169 CLR 279
at 287 per Mason CJ and Gaudron J, 293
per Dawson J.
933 The documents now in question, viz those of the Schedule 1 documents
consisting of §1782 documents, are agreed between the
parties not to be
referred to in Dr Greiner’s reports. Some of them were provided to Dr
Greiner but he did not include them
in his report. I do not regard the fact
that the Respondent knew some of these documents had been provided to Dr Greiner
not relied upon by him is of any legal significance.
934 It is apparent that the documents currently under consideration are
relevant to the allegations in §6AB. For example, one
of the documents is
evidence which tends to suggest that Ford US decided in 2011 to discontinue the
DPS6 and return to a conventional
automatic transmission. This is rationally
capable of supporting a finding that the DPS6 suffered from clutch shudder (when
with other evidence).
935 However, the way in which the Applicant conducted her case on clutch
shudder is that she would prove its existence on the basis
of Dr Greiner’s
evidence. This is a consequence of having elected to nominate Dr
Greiner’s evidence as the particulars
to §6AB. Since these documents
are not in Dr Greiner’s reports it follows that they are outside the
particularised case.
936 The Applicant submitted that this was not so. Here the argument was that
the documents tended to prove the matters identified
by Dr Greiner. However,
that submission impermissibly elides the allegations of material fact in
§6AB (which delimit and define
what is relevant in the proceeding) with the
particulars provided for that allegation by means of Dr Greiner’s reports
give notice to the Respondent of how that case is to be proved). That
the parties have acquiesced in the Applicant proving the allegations
§6AB by means of Dr Greiner’s reports does not entail that the
Applicant is therefore entitled to lead additional evidence
to support Dr
Greiner’s conclusions. I note for completeness that the particulars in
the 4FASOC do contain Document ID’s
of certain documents produced by Ford
US. None of these however are the documents which are the subject of the
current debate.
937 Consequently, I accept the Respondent’s submission that it is
procedurally unfair for the Applicant to rely upon the documents
in question to
prove the allegations in §6AB. Until the delivery of her closing written
submissions the Applicant has never
given the Respondent any meaningful
indication that she would seek to prove the allegations in §6AB by means of
these documents.
938 To this the Applicant rejoined that she had, in a large number of cases,
given the Respondent notice of her intention to tender
some of these documents
and had done so in advance of the trial. So much may be accepted but it does
not alter the fact that the
Applicant has not given the Respondent notice of an
intention to prove the allegations in §6AB other than by means of the
particulars to that allegation or by means of Dr Greiner’s
939 There is force therefore in the Respondent’s submission that it has
been deprived of the opportunity of considering whether
it should: (a) tender
some of the other §1782 documents perhaps to contradict the documents upon
which the Applicant now seeks
to rely; (b) ask its own witnesses about the
documents; and, (c) perhaps call other witnesses. The Applicant says that the
has not led any evidence about these matters. However, I do not
think that matters. Parties are often confined to the way in which
run their case (often by being tied to their particulars) and this is not
usually thought to require evidence from the
other party that they would be
prejudiced if some other course were taken. In any event, the prejudice pointed
to by the Respondent
– especially the possibility of considering whether
to tender additional documents – is to my mind reasonably obvious.
940 The Applicant submitted that if I thought there was something in the
Respondent’s position the more desirable course would
be to permit it to
take the steps it says it has been denied. Assessment of that submission occurs
in a context where the present
arose in the
last week of a six week trial;
required two
rounds of written submissions some weeks after the trial had concluded; and
will necessarily
be resolved after judgment had been reserved.
941 I do not accept in that context that it would be consistent with orderly
trial management to give the Respondent an opportunity
to reopen its case
several months after the trial has concluded so that it can be given an
opportunity to meet a case not foreshadowed
942 For completeness, I reject the Applicant’s submission that the
Respondent had consented to her use of these documents because
it had consented
to the final form of the tender list (which included the documents). As a
matter of formality, at the time the
Respondent objected to the use of Schedule
1 documents on the basis that they were not yet formally in evidence. They
find their way into evidence until 10.22 am on 29 July 2020 when
my Associate informed the parties that the documents identified
in document
TDL.010.006.0001 would be received into evidence. By this time, the trial had
been completed subject to the cleaning
up of some loose ends (such as the tender
of documents).
943 When the Schedule 1 documents were received into evidence on 29 July 2020
it is true that this occurred with the agreement of
the Respondent. However,
that agreement must be seen in context. On the last day of the trial,
24 July 2020, the Respondent had
indicated that there were a number of
documents in the draft list then provided to it which were not referred to
anywhere in the
evidence or in the submissions (by contrast the Schedule 1
documents were referred to in the Applicant’s closing written submissions
if not anywhere else). It was the Respondent’s position that these
never-referred-to documents should not be tendered. The
Applicant appears to
have agreed with this and removed documents of that kind from the final form of
list. The Respondent then agreed
to the tender of the balance. However, it is
quite clear that this took place against a backdrop which included the
Respondent’s
continuing objection to the Schedule 1 documents. I do
not think that its entitlement to make that objection was thereby lost.
continued to assert that reliance could not be placed upon the documents. Where
the Respondent makes good its objection, the
course I will take is to revoke to
the extent necessary the interlocutory order by which the documents were
944 In that circumstance, I conclude that it would be procedurally unfair for
the Applicant to be permitted to prove the allegations
in §6AB by relying
on those of the Schedule 1 documents which are drawn from the §1782
945 Despite the assertion in the Applicant’s written submissions that
all the documents relate to pleaded issues and many relate
to issues addressed
in Mr Kuhn’s evidence, the Applicant fell short of submitting that any of
the Schedule 1 documents were
properly to be seen as being in reply to Mr
Kuhn’s evidence and therefore admissible even if not mentioned in Dr
report. For example, part of the Respondent’s defence as
advanced by Mr Kuhn was that shudder was a normal operating characteristic
the DPS6 and did not constitute a defect. Legitimate evidence in reply to that
evidence would have included the tender of documents
proving that shudder was
not a normal operating characteristic of the DPS6. This may well have included
evidence which showed that
Ford US decided in 2011 to discontinue use of the
DPS6 in favour of a conventional automatic transmission. However, the Applicant
did not put the matter that way and I need not form a view about it. Had such a
submission been made, it would then have been necessary
to assess the procedural
consequences of the failure of the Applicant to cross-examine Mr Kuhn on this
material. The outcome of
that debate is not self-evident.
946 The parties were asked to prepare a table explaining their respective
views on each of the Schedule 1 documents. The Respondent
treated the table as
an invitation to formulate further objections lying beyond its procedural
fairness objection. I gave no leave
for such objections to be made and I do not
propose to entertain them.
Schedule 1 documents not being §1782
947 These documents were
not the subject of direct submission and their significance emerged only in the
table prepared by the parties.
948 The first document in this category is DIRD.001.001.0236 which is a
minute of a decision made within DIRD. The Applicant submitted
that the point
of this document was to rebut any assertion that DIRD’s position provided
evidence that there was no problem
with the input shaft seals. The point was to
show that the information which DIRD acted upon was not the same as the
information
before the Court. So viewed, the relevance of this evidence is as
reply evidence to the Respondent’s evidence concerning the
position of
DIRD. For example, Mr Cruse gave evidence at §52 of his affidavit
that DIRD had written to the Respondent on 17
October 2017 saying that its
concerns ‘were clarified satisfactorily’. I propose to permit this
document to remain in
949 The second document in this category is FOR.712.002.8367, an email
forwarding a 6 Panel report that was referred to by Dr Greiner.
The Applicant
wishes to rely on this document to show the existence of knowledge within the
Respondent of the input shaft seal issues
discussed in the report, an allegation
that appears at §20B(e). As with the §1782 documents, it would be
procedurally
unfair to allow this to occur when this document has never formed a
part of the particularised case.
950 The third document is a spreadsheet FOR.713.001.0347. This was said to
prove that the Respondent was aware of the TCM solder
issue. That allegation
appears at §20B(f). The particulars to that allegation indicate that this
will be proved by means of
FOR.713.001.0348 which is an agenda. I note that
while the agenda and spreadsheet appear to have been attached to the same email,
the contents of the spreadsheet could not be said to be reproduced or summarised
in the agenda. No application was made to amend
the particulars. The present
document therefore falls outside the particularised case and will be removed
from the evidence.
951 The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh documents are FOR.729.004.7466,
FOR.729.005.4035, FOR.729.005.4055 and FOR.729.005.4064.
Each is an email in
the same chain discussing the rear main oil seals and is said to prove the
allegation at §6AB(a)(iii).
None of these documents have ever formed part
of the particularised case and the Applicant first signalled her intention to
them on 16 July 2020. This was near the end of the fifth week of the
trial, when the only remaining evidence was that of Mr Stockton
Dr Strombom on aggregate loss and damage. These documents will be removed
from the evidence.
952 The eighth document is FOR.758.001.3126, the unsworn affidavit of Matthew
Fyie, of Ford US, dated 3 July 2020. This affidavit
was produced in
the context of an application made by the Applicant to discharge suppression
orders that applied to the §1782
documents. The Applicant wishes to rely
on the affidavit to support its submission that a
Jones v Dunkel
inference should be drawn against the Respondent in relation to its failure
to call witnesses who had detailed knowledge of the alleged
deficiencies.
Mr Fyie was not called to give evidence regarding the DPS6 and the
Applicant submits that the existence of his unsworn
affidavit evidences his
availability to do so. Having being produced during the third week of the
trial, this document clearly could
not have formed part of the particularised
case. However, given that it was filed and served by the Respondent (despite
to have been prepared by the solicitors acting for Ford US) there does
not seem to be any procedural unfairness flowing from the
Applicant relying on
it. I will therefore allow it to remain in evidence.
953 The ninth document is FOR.700.005.0013, a spreadsheet said to be relevant
to the allegations concerning the friction material
that appear at
§6AB(a)(i)(A), §6AB(a)(v) and §6AB(a)(ci). Despite being
attached to a 14D report which is in evidence,
this spreadsheet has not been
particularised. It will be removed from the evidence.
954 The final two documents are FOR.725.026.6816 and FOR.725.026.6819. Both
were attached to an email referred to by Dr Greiner and
are said to prove the
allegation at §6AB(a)(iii) relating to the rear main oil seal deficiency.
However Dr Greiner’s
reference to the covering email does not extend to
how the Applicant seeks to use the attachments in question at [382] of her
submissions. They do not form part of the particularised case and will
be removed from the evidence.
955 I will therefore
remove from the evidence all of the objected to Schedule 1 documents save for
the DIRD minute and the unsworn
affidavit of Matthew Fyie. The appropriate way
for this to occur is for me to revoke the order admitting the Schedule 1
into evidence, save for those where the Respondent does not press its
objection and the two documents I have determined should remain
in evidence.
Judicial notice
956 I propose to take
judicial notice of the fact that driving a car inevitably has some degree of
risk. In particular, I note that
the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(‘ABS’) has recorded that 739 people died in 2019 as a ‘Car
occupant injured
in transport accident’. To take notice of the fact that
people die driving cars each year in Australia I must consider whether
requirements of
Evidence Act 1995
(Cth) have been satisfied.
144 Matters of common knowledge
(1) Proof is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to
question and is:
(a) common knowledge in the locality in
which the proceeding is being held or generally; or
(b) capable of verification by reference to a document the authority of which
cannot reasonably be questioned.
(2) The judge may acquire knowledge of that kind in any
way the judge thinks fit.
(3) The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is to take knowledge of
that kind into account.
(4) The judge is to give a party such opportunity to make submissions, and to
refer to relevant information, relating to the acquiring
or taking into account
of knowledge of that kind as is necessary to ensure that the party is not
unfairly prejudiced.
957 Considering then
s 144(1)(b)
, it is relevant to
note the effect of
Evidence Act
. It states:
159 Official statistics
A document that purports:
(a) to be published by the Australian
Statistician; and
(b) to contain statistics or abstracts compiled and analysed by the Australian
Statistician under the
Census and Statistics Act 1905
is evidence that those statistics or abstracts were compiled and analysed by the
Australian Statistician under that Act.
958 In light of the definition of ‘Australian Statistician’ in
Evidence Act
’s Dictionary and the deeming effect of
Census and Statistics Act 1905
(Cth), s 159 encompasses
documents published by the ABS such as
3303.0 Causes of Death, Australia,
(Australian Bureau of Statistics, Canberra, 23 October 2020).
The effect of s 159 means that I am to take this document as evidence
the statistics it contains were compiled and analysed by the Australian
Statistician. I therefore can conclude that for the
purposes of
s 144(1)(b) it is a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be
questioned.
959 While this satisfies the 2nd limb of s 144(1), the knowledge that
people die driving cars each year must also be ‘not reasonably
question’. I am satisfied that this is the case as the knowledge falls
within the same category of information such
as ‘asbestos is dangerous and
can be deadly’: see
Kent v Wotton & Byrne Pty Ltd
[2006] TASSC
15 Tas R 264
per Blow J, cited in Odgers S,
Uniform Evidence
ed, Thomson Reuters, 2019) p 1351 [144.60]. This is
not the kind of knowledge that I considered in
Parmar v Minister for
Immigration and Citizenship
[2011] FCA 760
, which was the
intricacies of a language test. It is more akin to the information found in a
meteorological document or a map: see
Wentworth District Capital Ltd v
Commissioner of Taxation
[2010] FCA 862
. Finally s 144(4)
requires me to give parties the opportunity to make submissions as is necessary
to ensure that they are not unfairly
prejudiced. I do not see how any
submissions are necessary to avoid prejudice here as neither party could be
disadvantaged if I
take this knowledge into account, nor could the fact that
‘people die driving cars each year in Australia’ be meaningfully
contradicted. Section 144(2) therefore allows me to acquire the knowledge
in any way I see fit and I do so by reference to the document
published by the
ABS. I then rely on s 144(3) to take this knowledge into account.
SECTION XVII: CONCLUSION AND ANSWERS TO COMMON

paragraph 20B of the 4FASOC?
10 Did the Respondent know, and if so, from when, the matters pleaded at
paragraph 20D(a) of the 4FASOC?
Guarantee Subgroup
11 When the Affected Vehicles were supplied as new, did they fail to comply with
the guarantee of acceptable quality within the meaning
of s 54 of the ACL?
Ford Customer Subgroup
12 Did Ford Australia make, to the Applicant and Ford Customer Subgroup Members
(as defined in paragraph 7B(b) of 4FASOC):
(a) the Vehicle Representations (as defined
in paragraph 7A of the 4FASOC), and if so, were those representations false and
in contravention of
of the ACL and/or liable to mislead the
public as to the nature, the characteristics of the suitability for purpose of
Affected Vehicles
in contravention of s 33 of the ACL;
(b) the Transmission Representations (as defined in paragraph 7F of the 4FASOC),
and if so, were those representations false and
misleading in contravention of
of the ACL and/or liable to mislead the public as to the nature, the
characteristics of the suitability for purpose of Affected Vehicles
contravention of s 33 of the ACL.
13 Did Ford Australia make, to the Applicant and Ford
Customer Subgroup Members, the PowerShift Representations (as defined in
8A of the 4FASOC), and, if so, were the PowerShift Representations
misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention
of the ACL.
14 Were the PowerShift Representations liable to mislead the public as to the
nature, the characteristics, or the suitability for
purpose of the Affected
Vehicles, in contravention of s 33 of the ACL.
961 Some of these may be answered as they stand. For example for Question 1
and Question 2:
(1) Which Affected Vehicles, when supplied as new,
contained or were part of model lines containing a PowerShift Transmission that
(a) Component Deficiency – Friction
All Focuses; Fiestas manufactured before
7 January 2015 (excluding the 1.0L ‘Fox’ Fiesta); and
EcoSports manufactured
3 September 2016.
(b) Component Deficiency – Input Shaft
Fiestas manufactured before 30 August 2013; Focuses
manufactured at the Ford Thailand Manufacturing plant before 2 September 2013;
Focuses manufactured at the Saarlouis plant before 28 June 2013; and EcoSports
manufactured before 1 October 2013.
(c) Component Deficiency – Rear Main
(d) Component Deficiency – TCM Solder Cracks?
Fiestas manufactured at the AutoAlliance Thailand
plant before 23 June 2014; Fiestas manufactured at the Ford Thailand
Manufacturing
plant before 10 November 2014; Focuses manufactured before 10
November 2014; and EcoSports manufactured before 10 November 2014
(2) Which Affected Vehicles, when supplied as new, contained or were part of
model lines containing a PowerShift Transmission that
(a) Architecture Deficiency – Damping?
All Affected Vehicles to the extent it led to a slight shudder at low speeds
and gear rattling.
(b) Architecture Deficiency – Heat?
962 It is also clear that the answers to Question 5(a)-(d) and
Question 8(a)-(e) are all ‘no’.
963 So far as Questions 3, 4, 6 and 7 are concerned, the decision to use the
concept of performance, reliability, durability, safety
and comfort issues is
liable to mask a great deal of detail. Although I will hear the parties on
this, it would be better if the
questions were restated to reflect the precise
Component Deficiencies and risks associated with them. For example, the
of B8080 clutch lining material carried with it risks of a number of
symptoms only one of which was self-excited shudder. The risks
and symptoms
should be precisely identified in the questions.
964 Question 9 relates to the misadventure which is 4FASOC §20B and
should not be answered. Question 10 relates to the barely
§20D(a). The Applicant refers to §20D(a) in her submissions just
twice at [552] and [558]. As far as I can
see its only purpose is as part of
the same misadventure of §20B, being the inchoate larger omissions case.
The actual allegation
in §20D(a) is:
By reason of the matters alleged in paragraphs 6AB-6AC,
6Al, 6AK, 6AM, 20B, and further or alternatively, paragraph 20C, during the
relevant period, Ford Australia knew that:
(a) it had advised on, and Dealers had implemented, certain repairs and
replacement works to be carried out on certain Affected Vehicles
to attempt to
address the Vehicle Defects and PowerShift Transmission Defect (or one, some or
all of them);
965 Holding this up to the light and squinting, I take this to be a reference
to the fact that the Respondent implemented the three
fixes for vehicles which
were already in service and consequently, in relation to each implementation,
must be taken to have known
the nature of the problem which was being fixed.
Thus, for example, the replacement of the input shaft seals from August 2013
rise to an implication that the Respondent knew that the input shaft seals
were being replaced because there was something wrong
with them and that the
something was likely to be that they had leaked. Similar observations may be
made about the B8080 clutch
lining material, software update 15B22 and the
revised TCM. In principle, I accept this. However, rather than push the actual
I have made through the definition of the Vehicle Defects and
PowerShift Transmission Defect in the 4FASOC, it would be better if
the question
actually reflects what the factual debate was – that is, the debate within
the framework of issues assayed by
Dr Greiner.
966 As for Question 11, while the answer to the Question as it stands is
‘yes’, this will need to be adjusted to reflect
at least two
matters. The first is the fact that each deficiency (constituted by a risk)
gives rise to a separate cause of action
under s 271(1). The second is
that the particular deficiency (risks) will need to be identified with
precision. Some attention
may eventually need to be given to the fact that some
of the vehicles were supplied before the commencement of the ACL.
967 Questions 12(a), 12(b) and 13 should be answered ‘no’.
Question 14 does not arise.
968 In addition to the existing questions it is apparent that the parties in
fact litigated a number of issues which they omitted
to state as common
questions. That will now need to be rectified. They include (at least):
(a) the proper construction of s 271(1),
s 271(6) and s 272;
(b) the problems which were successfully repaired by the Respondent;
(c) the problems which were not;
(d) whether, in relation to the successful repairs, the relevant group members
