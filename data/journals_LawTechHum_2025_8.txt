1. Introduction
On 27 November 2023, the Beijing Internet Court
issued its judgment in
Li Yunkai v Liu Yuanchun
marking the first
judicial decision in China to address copyrightability and authorship of
AI-generated images. The case centred
on text-to-image generation, where the
plaintiff used Stable Diffusion by entering tailored prompts to produce an image
later appropriated
by the defendant. The court held that the AI-generated image
constituted a work of fine art under Chinese copyright law, with authorship
attributed to the user for their original textual input. This ruling diverges
from prevailing academic narratives, which often reject
AI-generated content (AIGC)
its perceived lack of human creativity. By framing generative AI as a mere tool
akin to a paintbrush or camera, the judiciary
sidestepped debates about AI
autonomy, instead focusing on user agency in shaping outputs.
This article presents the split between the academic and judicial narratives
under the background of
. Based on the judicial narrative, it
further investigates the legal bases for protecting AI-generated images as works
of fine art
in the Chinese copyright system, chiefly the Chinese Copyright
and its Implementation
Regulations.
The investigation found that protecting AI-generated images as works of fine
art requires copyright to keep up with the development
of artistic narratives.
The legal bases in the Chinese copyright system come from a
lex specialis
that admits aesthetic effects as originality. The reference to aesthetic effect
adopts a zero-originality threshold. Additionally,
in the context of fine art,
the Chinese copyright system should accept that creating a work of fine art with
generative AIs begins
with tweaking the AIs’ initial outputs.
After this introduction, this article presents an overview of
and the general narrative about the protectability of AIGC and the assignment of
their rights. It then examines the validity of its
holding by first looking into
the originality requirement to recognise works of fine art. It continues the
examination by probing
whether and how directing generative AIs with prompts
could amount to human creation. Eventually, the article concludes by presenting
its findings and implications.

dispute centred exclusively on AI-generated images. The plaintiff utilised
Stable Diffusion, an open-source generative AI model,
to produce images through
text-based prompts. After implementing a third-party fine-tuned model within the
Stable Diffusion framework,
the plaintiff input a series of keywords as prompts
as shown in
. Prompts used to generate the image in
The plaintiff devised and entered 20 terms as the initial positive prompt.
For the negative prompt, he input 120 terms, of which only
the first was
original; the remaining 119 were copied from third-party sources. After removing
duplications, the negative prompt
contained 75 unique terms. The plaintiff
generated an initial image using these prompts, then added more keywords to the
prompt to achieve various effects. He produced the image in dispute,
after including ten more additional terms in the positive prompt. This image,
along with others, was uploaded to his social media
account and labelled with
tags such as ‘AI’ and ‘AI illustration’.
. Image in dispute in
The defendant saw those tags, downloaded the disputed image from the
plaintiff’s social media account, removed the identifying
watermark and
repurposed it as an illustration of his own poem on another platform. The
plaintiff subsequently filed a lawsuit, alleging
infringement of his right of
authorship and right of communication through information network.
The plaintiff clearly assumed that the image should be a work of fine art
within the meaning of copyright and that he had created
the image by entering
the prompt. The Beijing Internet Court fully supported these assumptions. It
held that the AI-generated image
should be a work of fine art within the meaning
of copyright because the plaintiff created it by entering an original prompt.
judgment has taken effect in the absence of appeal.
AIGC in the Academic Narrative of Copyright
The ruling in
appears to conflict with prevailing academic
discourse on copyright protection for AIGC, which generally opposes classifying
as protectable works or vesting exclusive rights in users. Central to this
discourse is the principle that copyright law remains
anthropocentric. If AIGC is produced through autonomous machine processes devoid
of direct human agency, it should fall
outside the scope of copyright
protection, which requires human authorship.
A work eligible for copyright protection must originate from a human creator.
This requirement is rooted in anthropocentric philosophical
foundations, such as
personality theory. Hegelian philosophy posits that creative works embody the
externalisation of an author’s
personality,

granting moral and economic rights. Early copyright advocacy, exemplified by

of copyright. A realistic evaluation of the level of

feasible, but not without a problem. AIGC can be the subject matter of a
right because such right aims to incentivise investments rather than

it should be awarded

2.3 AIGC in the
Judicial Narrative in China
On the map of the academic narrative of AIGC, Chinese judges adopt the
narrative that generative AIs are their users’ tools
for creation. This
narrative differs from the prevailing academic viewpoint by treating generative
AI as a tool assisting human creation
without distinguishing between the
intellectual contributions of developers and users. Under this approach, AI
functions as a mere
tool, akin to a pen or Photoshop, and AIGC should not be
treated differently from content created with conventional tools.
The Chinese judicial authority officially announced this narrative at the
WIPO Conversation on Intellectual Property (IP) and AI in

plaintiffs in this case set off a balloon with a camera attached at a time and
place of their choice. The camera recorded video
according to a pre-installed
program. The dispute concerned whether some frames taken from the recording
could be protected as works
of photography. The photos in dispute were slightly
edited before they were made publicly accessible on the internet. The publicly
accessible photos were then appropriated by the defendants as they were.
The significance of
Gao v Youku
lies in both its legal rationale and
its role in shaping regulations concerning generative AI. The trial court and
appellate court
differed in their interpretation of the minimal originality
threshold required for copyright protection. The trial court applied
‘personal touch’ standard, which requires a work to bear the
author’s personality or
individuality.
It ruled that the
photographs lacked originality because they were automatically recorded and did
not reflect the plaintiffs’
personality over the captured images.
In contrast, the appellate court adopted a threshold higher than the
‘sweat of the brow’ doctrine but lower than the ‘personal
touch’ standard.
‘sweat of the brow’ doctrine grants copyright based on labour alone,
without necessitating a distinct personal
The appellate court
determined that the photographs met the minimal originality requirement. The
originality was demonstrated by
the intellectual labour devoted to their
creation, which consisted of choosing the time and place, setting the parameters
camera, and selecting and editing the photos. The reversal thus suggests
that the minimal originality threshold in Mainland China
aligns closely with the
modicum of originality threshold.
Referring to
Gao v Youku
in the context of regulating generative AI,
however, denotes another significance: the constitution of creation. Creators
must exercise
control in the process of creation. The court of appeal rebutted
the trial court in this regard when commenting on the originality
of the photos.
It held that the photos were original instead of random because the plaintiffs
could repeat the process of setting
off a balloon and recover the camera until
they were satisfied with the results. Under this background, the
plaintiff’s choice
of time and place, as well as the selection and editing
of frames, must be interpreted as exercising control. Such control was not
affected by using an automated tool. Thus, the process of creation extends
beyond the initial fixation of results; creators make
choices not only through
action but also through inaction, such as discontinuing the creative

compatible with this academic narrative.
Chinese judges changed their stance on the output of partially generative AI.
Before the policy of treating AIGC as AI users’
creation was officially
announced, they adhered to the academic narrative. In
the Beijing Internet
Court held that the output should not be a human creation. In this case, the
plaintiff generated a report using
a database and a generative AI service
provided by Wolters Kluwer. The plaintiff set search and filter terms, then
verified and corrected
the statistics before publishing the report online. The
defendant reuploaded the report, arguing that it was not a human creation,
denying secondary liability. The court agreed, despite recognising that both the
plaintiff and Wolters Kluwer had made intellectual
contributions to the report.
The same court later rendered

narrative. If the rationale of

The judicial narrative that generative AI should be its user’s tool for
creation is maintained in subsequent disputes. Almost
a year after

, the second judgment protecting an AI-generated image as a work
of fine art.
The plaintiff
entered textual prompts to generate an initial image with Midjourney, an AI that
generates images based on text or
imagery inputs. Finding the AI’s
adjustments unsatisfactory, he refined the image with Photoshop before using the
refined image
as the input to Midjourney to develop the final image, which was
allegedly infringed.
The process of creation in
Lin v Gauss Inflatable
revealed that
Midjourney was not a Photoshop-like tool. However, the court held that the AI
user’s action amounted to creation
and did not find it necessary to
distinguish generating output with Midjourney from editing images with
Photoshop. Even though the
AI alone could not execute the plaintiff’s
creative plan, the plaintiff still had other means – that is, Photoshop
to reinforce the AI’s operation to get the desired result.
Essentially, the court perceived generative AI as a tool, albeit
one requiring
greater efforts to control than Photoshop.
There is no official explanation for why Chinese judges decided to hold
generative AI users as the creators of the output. Some factors
indicative. First, protecting AIGC as work is compatible with social perception.
A survey has revealed that the reception
of AIGC is much more positive among
Chinese subjects than American subjects, both implicitly and
explicitly.
Due to the positive
reception, the public may not feel the need to distinguish AIGC from
conventional creation. It is possible that
judges share this sentiment.
Second, when an AI is partially generative, appointing its users as the
creators of its output can integrate AIGC into the regulation
of user-generated
content (UGC). UGC is the digital content made by internet users, characterised
by amateurism.
The feature of
amateurism distinguishes UGC from professionally generated content (PGC). PGC is
the digital content made by individuals
or organisations with professional
skills, knowledge and expertise in a particular field, such as advertisements
Compared with UGC, PGC
is high in quality but costly to produce. In this regard, AIGC combines the

Feilin v Baidu
, there is always a human
content user responsible for creating AIGC, and the partially generative tool
should be treated as if it
were an ordinary tool. Accordingly, AIGC can be
regulated as UGC.
Lastly, protecting AIGC may suit future policies. China is still on the path
of raising the awareness that IP rights should be protected.
Denying copyright
protection to AIGC, especially when they are indistinguishable from
human-created works, could send a conflicting
message. If AIGC were deemed
ineligible for protection, users might withhold information about their reliance
on AI, leading to uncertainty
Moreover, as generative AIs develop, users may take on some of the
developers’ roles in training the corresponding algorithms.
For example,
AI personal computers allow users to train and run AIs on local data instead of
transmitting the request and data to
Hence, in an optimistic
light, generative AI may indeed become an ordinary tool for creation in the
future, just as many ordinary
tools for creation by contemporary standards, such
as the camera, were regarded as highly autonomous centuries ago.

3.1 Work in General
As a general observation, the Chinese Copyright Law is a product of legal
transplant. Mainland China transplanted established copyright
rules without much
commitment to the underlying philosophies. The transplanted rules and their
application in China exhibit a postmodern
character compared with their source

than Western legal
traditions. On the other hand, from a Western perspective, Oriental philosophies
were incorporated into postmodernism
as a means of critiquing modernity,
including the philosophies underlying copyright law.
The definition of a ‘work’ exemplifies this phenomenon. Following
the 2020 revision, Chinese copyright law defines a work
‘intellectual achievement with
duchuang xing
in the literary,
artistic, and scientific domains’ that ‘can be presented in a
certain form’.
duchuang xing
encompasses both the originality requirement and the need
for human creation. While often translated as ‘originality’,
literally means ‘the nature of being independently created’. This
concept aligns with the originality standard in
US copyright law, which
recognises works based on independent creation combined with a modicum of
originality. Therefore, for an
object to be considered a work under Chinese
presented in a tangible form.
Understanding the originality requirement needs to contextualise it with the
other two requirements. The requirement of human creation
relates to originality
because creation is a process, but it does not always lead to originality. It is
generally accepted that human
creation imparts originality, but there may also
be other conditions to admit originality, such as the form of presentation

meaning that a work does not need to be permanently

of being fixed to delineate its scope of copyright protection.
More importantly, the Implementation Regulations define works based
forms of presentation, particularly in the case of fine art. Consequently, the
form of presentation can serve as an additional
source of originality beyond
human creation.
The postmodern nature of the Chinese understanding of originality comes from
weighing between human creation and forms of presentation
as its source. The
CJEU clearly revealed that human creation is the only source of originality. It

and creative choices – that is,

, it further held that aesthetic effect is not necessarily original
because it may also arise from technical function rather than
the author’s
free and creative choices.
emphasis that originality must come from the creator’s free and creative
choices is based on legal traditions established
before modernity.
Limiting originality to human creation induces a dilemma between the uniform
protection of art and the protection of art with established
and new aesthetic
tastes. Only admitting the author’s own intellectual creation as
originality reflects the
unité de l’art
theory. In the
context of copyright, the theory advocates applying the same originality
threshold to works of applied art and works
of fine art
treating them as
indivisible. However, the
unité de l’art
principally a theory of art, which was proposed to advocate that all arts should
be indivisible in their aesthetic merits,
but only insofar as they conform to a
certain taste. Equally importantly, it was advanced as a theory to exclude new
art and aesthetics
from the scope of art and denounce such things as
‘false art’.
Therefore, limiting the source of originality to human creation could entail an
exclusion of art based on aesthetic taste.
Chinese legislators took an aesthetic stance to list the form of presentation
as a plausible source of originality. Ideally, copyright
should refrain from
judging creations based on their artistic

is a factor for granting copyright among
member states.
The reason is
that aesthetic merit demonstrates the uniqueness of creation – the
creator’s individuated choice –
which separates the creation from
the generic or commonplace
arrangement.
Recognising the form of presentation as a parallel source of originality has
its basis in postmodern art and philosophy. The role
of presentation in defining
artistic importance is evident in the theories of Jacques Lacan, the French
psychologist and psychoanalyst
known for critiquing premodern and modern
philosophical frameworks, including those underlying copyright law.
Lacan’s engagement
with artists led him to conceptualise presentation as
an act of framing – that is, an effort to impose aesthetic order, commonly
referred to as
Conventionally, gazing does not constitute creation as it does not generate
something new. By acknowledging the form of presentation
as an alternative
source of originality, the legal framework becomes more inclusive in its
recognition of creative works.
3.2 Works of
Fine Art in Specific: A Legacy of Artistic Narratives
The admission of works of fine art is special within the Chinese copyright
system. The Implementation Regulations define works of
fine art as:
two- or three-dimensional works of the plastic arts comprising lines, colors
or other media which impart aesthetic effect, such as
paintings, works of
calligraphy and sculptures.
This definition is a
lex specialis
because it conditions the
recognition of works of fine art upon aesthetic effect. If we subsume this
definition into a definition
of works that states works of fine art are works,
the aesthetic effects in lines, colours and other media in two or three
must be taken as the contextualised originality requirement. Such
reference is a
lex specialis
, as it only happens to works of fine art and
architecture.
Hence, protecting
AI-generated images as works of fine art should be distinguished from protecting
other forms of AIGC in the Chinese
The reference to aesthetic effect is specific to works of fine art due to the
development of art theories from modernism to postmodernism.
Dada and its legacy
in Lacanian theory opened a gateway to approaching the Chinese view of fine art
and aesthetics from a Western
background. Dada, or Dadaism, refers to ‘a
movement of art and literature based on deliberate irrationality and negation of
traditional artistic values’ that emerged after the outbreak of World War
I or ‘the art and literature produced by this
It is a bridge
between Eastern and Western art theories because Dada, in its infancy, drew from
the Daoist concept of change and
the Buddhist idea of impermanence to criticise
the pre-modern and modern paradigms of Western art and
aesthetics.
Among other things, Dada challenged the Kantian theory of art and aesthetics.
Immanuel Kant used the term ‘interest’ to
mean the delight connected
with the representation of an object’s existence and defined beauty
– or pure aesthetics –
as pure disinterested
Fine art is a scheme in
the empirical judgement of taste as it evokes charm in addition to the delight
Therefore, Kantian
fine art is always an aesthetic order made of symbols representing pleasure.
Dada rejected the Kantian theory by making or calling pieces that do not
represent anything ‘art’. A notable example is

In this sense,
aesthetics is the result of framing a symbolic order. Duchamp established the
aesthetic effect with
The Fountain
by presenting the urinal as a symbol
that does not represent anything else.
Since all effects framed in a piece are aesthetic, referring to aesthetic
effect as originality denotes that Mainland China operates
zero-originality threshold to admit works of fine art. The minimal originality
threshold is generally considered a gatekeeper preventing
protecting trivial objects. Dropping the minimal originality threshold to zero
does not risk excessive protection.
The real issue delineating the scope of
admission of
litigation, copyright is usually asserted and presumed because formality is not
a prerequisite for protection. During litigation,
judges compare two works to
see whether they are substantially similar to establish infringement.
Infringement can be dismissed when
the similarity arises from the same
commission requirement, public domain, commonplace arrangement or
functionality.
4. Requirement of Human Creation
This section examines the requirement of human creation in relation to
protecting AI-generated images as works of fine art. The Chinese
system includes a
lex specialis
that recognises aesthetic effects as a
criterion for originality in works of fine art. Accordingly, assessing the
validity of the
above argument necessitates evaluating whether this
exempts works of fine art from the human creation requirement
before examining whether and how text-to-image generation can constitute

to all works. In comparison, the
reference to aesthetic effects as the originality is provided in the
Implementation Regulations
subordinate to the Chinese Copyright Law, and it
applies specifically to works of fine art. Therefore, the reference to aesthetic
effects only means the originality of a work of fine art may arise from
aesthetics subsisting in the form of presentation. It does
not, however,
eliminate the fundamental requirement of human creation as part of
Having affirmed that works of fine art must be human creations, the
investigation should focus on what constitutes human creation.
In this regard,
article 2 of the Implementation Regulations defines ‘creation’
as ‘the intellectual action that
directly leads to the production of
literary, artistic and scientific works’. The requirement of directness
may be satisfied
by directly conceiving and executing the creative plan because
they are the two stages comprising of
Some scholars propose that redaction may be a third stage of creation for
being a stage to finalise a work as one may change the creative
subsequently execute the change
Nevertheless, since the
formula of conception and execution accommodates revising the creative plan and
executing the revised creative
plan, the role of redaction should be understood
as revising the creative plan and executing the revised plan, rather than
the process of creation. The decision
Gao v Youku
supports this
interpretation, as the Chinese judiciary recognised redaction as evidence of
creation on the grounds that finalisation
demonstrated the existence of a
conceived and executed creative plan.
Other scholars postulated authorial intention as a condition for
In the Chinese
of works. For example, people with
severe mental illness can still be the
authors of their creations, despite being physically and legally incapable of
forming intentions.
The relevance of intention is thus limited to creating
inseparable joint work, which requires creators to communicate and jointly
develop a specific result.
Two aspects must be examined to assess the validity of recognising the
AI-generated image in
as a human creation: (1) whether the
rationale presented in the judgment convincingly establishes that the AI
user’s prompt
sufficiently defined the expressive elements of the image;
and (2) how the use of generative AI may satisfy the definition of creation.
following sections explore these issues in detail.
Sufficiency by Humans
, the key argument for protecting the AI-generated image as
a work of fine art was that the originality in the image came from the
Therefore, the validity of this holding hinges on whether the prompt adequately
defined the expressive elements of the image.

featured text-to-image generation, a technology that takes in the user’s
textual command and delivers imagery results. In this
content-generation
mechanism, users directly provide a textual prompt rather than an image. If the
aesthetic effects in lines, colours
or other media in two or three dimensions
hold the originality of works of fine art, then to create a work of fine art,
directly define such effects.
In text-to-image generation, the crux of admitting the users’ operation
of generative AI as creation lies in the sufficiency
of their prompt
formulation. It is questionable whether language – written or spoken
– can formulate expressive visual
elements because it is more abstract
than images as a means of expression. The abstract nature of language is
reflected by the faculty
enabling linguistic communication. Animals can process
but processing language
needs much greater cognitive faculty, which remains exclusively a human
The abstract nature of language in spoken and written forms makes it
difficult to define the expressive elements of images with text.
The challenge
comes from the idea–expression dichotomy, which limits copyright to
expressions and forbids it to extend to ‘ideas,
procedures, methods of
operation or mathematical concepts as
The term ‘as
such’ reveals that ideas become expressions through concrete
formulation.
formulation can rarely define imagery expressive elements. The protection of
fictional characters in the United States provides
ample examples in this regard
as they migrate in forms.
For example, in
on behalf of the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in the United States, Judge Posner
elaborated on why copyright should differentiate
the protection of literary and
graphic characters as follows:
A reader of unillustrated fiction completes the work in his mind; the reader
of a comic book or the viewer of a movie is passive.
That is why kids lose a lot
when they don’t read fiction, even when the movies and television that
they watch are aesthetically
If the prompts in
defined all expressive elements, they
should have produced a result with a reasonable degree of certainty regarding
the image’s
appearance. In this regard, AI users are not required to
define the exact result. For example, creation should be recognised in cases
making photographs of the views of a
kaleidoscope
or setting, and
placing a camera in the wild that is to be triggered by passing
Nevertheless, the
same verbal instruction may correspond to various expressions; settling on a
particular expression calls for making
choices, thereby evidencing the existence
of creation. Subsequently, in a text-to-image generation, an AI user should
formulate the
prompt in a sufficiently concrete manner to create a work of fine
Chinese judges have identified the volume of literary formulation as an
indicator of concreteness in defining visual expressive elements.
Jikang v Qujing Cigarette Factory
, the Yunan High People’s Court had
to decide whether ‘
wuduo jinhua
’ contained
originality.
literally means ‘five pieces of golden flowers’, and it figuratively
means ‘five women with honorable
characters’. It carries three
significances in the dispute: the play co-authored by the plaintiff, the title
of the play and
the five figures in the play. The plaintiff sought protection of
the term to exclude the defendant from using the term as a trademark.
The Yunan High People’s Court held that the play and the characters in
the context of the play were original because they conveyed
the authors’
ideas, emotions, personalities and styles. However, a viewer could not perceive
originality by reading the short
title alone. The literary formulation of the
title did not accumulate to a degree that was sufficiently concrete to admit
originality.
Although the Chinese courts have not explicitly outlined how to determine
whether literary formulation is sufficient to establish
originality in works of
fine art, insights can be drawn from jurisprudence in other jurisdictions. For
example, the German Federal
Court recognised the literary character Pippi
Longstocking as a protected work under copyright
Pippi Longstocking is
the central character of a series of novels by Astrid Lindgren, which have been
adapted into graphic and cinematic
works. The court held that the character
should be protected as a work independent of the novels because she was
‘an unmistakable
combination of external features, characteristics,
abilities, and typical behaviours, thus being shaped into particularly distinct
personalities and occurring in the story in a particular characteristic
court’s reasoning suggests that the literary formulation of a character
must be extensive to yield graphic expressions,
as Lindgren devoted a series of
novels to characterise her.
By analogy, the formulation of the prompt in
should not have
justified holding the AI user as the creator of the AI-generated image. The
were simply too
short and too abstract to define the expressive elements of an image.
Furthermore, most terms were allocated to the
negative prompt to define what the
output should not contain. The fact that such terms were mostly copied from
third parties shows
that they do not directly cause the expressive elements of a
particular image. Subsequently, the rationale given in
not justify holding the generative AI user as the creator of the AI-generated
4.3 Prompt Sufficiency by Machines: Another
Legacy of Artistic Narratives
While prompts alone may not define all expressive elements of an AI-generated
image, their implementation in the circumstances may
constitute creation. The
application of new technology may require reevaluating the process of creation.
Just as art helps to interpret
the Chinese originality threshold for works of
fine art, it may also systematically reveal the meaning of direct causality to
creation according to the Chinese Copyright Law.
The major obstacle to recognising that generative AI users directly caused
the originality of the generated images comes from the
randomness in the
AI’s functioning. Randomness implies that a person has diminished control
in creation, and therefore weakens
the claim that a user has defined all
expressive elements.
unpredictability also contributes to the perception of AI as possessing
intelligence. For example, AlphaGo Zero randomly predicts
the next few moves
based on the existing moves rather than exhaustively predicting all scenarios
because that is beyond the current
computational
Each modal of
generative AI has its own mechanism to introduce randomness. The following gives
a very streamlined illustration of
the mechanism of Stable Diffusion, as it was
the AI involved in
Stable Diffusion generates images based on the diffusion model, which
conceptually reverses the random Brownian motion when drops
of colour diffuse in
Stable Diffusion
starts image generation with a random
like the diffused
solution. The tensor is a collection of data noise in latent space, which a user
cannot see or decipher information
The user’s prompt
instructs the modal to predict what the noise should
The noise predicted is
subtracted layer-by-layer from the
The cycle of
predicting and removing noise from the tensor stops when the schedule reaches
the user’s request.
Eventually, the decoder translates the remaining data of the tensor from the
latent space to an image in the foreground the user
In the artistic practice, methodological randomness does not prejudice an
artist’s conception and execution of a creative plan.
A touchstone in this
regard is Jackson Pollock’s painting
One: Number 31
Pollock was an
American painter in the school of Abstract Expressionism. He was known for his
‘action painting’, dripping
and splattering paint onto the canvas,
as embodied in
One: Number
The random quality is
the very reason why it is a masterpiece and a recurring theme in copyright.
One: Number
Randomness is a part of Pollock’s painting methodology. According to
Pollock, when he started creation, he only had a general
idea of how the result
would turn out.
He could not
envision where exactly a drop of paint would land on the canvas, although he
chose paints in certain colors and of particular
consistency. Furthermore, it is
also questionable whether he could repeat the moves he made to create
The randomness was inherent in his creative plan because, to him, the canvas
is an arena where actions happen, and the paintings are
only the records of
those events.
Accordingly, by
planning how to act, Pollock defined the expressive elements of
One: Number
. The randomness that should prevent him from being recognised as the
creator should rather be accidents such as unexpected forces
If those events
should happen, Pollock could reclaim the creative plan by undoing the traces of
those events.
The randomness in Pollock’s methodology is comparable to the
functioning of generative AI. Using generative AI to derive images
essentially
uses Pollock’s methodology of action painting to produce a less
avant-garde result. When users choose a generative
AI or a model to generate
images, they settle on the methodology to incorporate unknown randomness into
creation, like Pollock. The
correlation between text and image integrated into
the automation of generative AI is a symbolic order. In Lacan’s cognitive
theory, the symbolic order is the unconscious beyond
individuals.
randomness is an external factor to each individual self, the automation should
not prejudice the conception of a creative
The conception and execution of the user’s creative plan begins by
tweaking the AI’s initial outputs. When users enter
the initial prompts,
they put forward a general idea of what to present and how to present that is
not concrete enough to conceive
a creative plan because the initial prompts
could not define all expressive elements. Since the users cannot conceive a
plan with the initial prompts, the initial output cannot be the
execution of a creative plan.
Regarding Stable Diffusion, the generative AI in
initial prompt could give rise to multiple results depending on the random
tensors in the latent space. Accordingly, the
initial prompt particularises the
latent space. Analogous to action painting, the AI’s response to the
initial prompts helps
the user discover a canvas to record creative actions that
are about to happen. The conception and execution of the user’s
plan should commence from the tweaking of the initial output. The tweaking of
the initial output should justify the creation
of the entire outcome, just as
redaction justifies recognising the creation of the
Users must document the effectiveness of tweaking. Documenting the tweaking
ensures that users are directly responsible for all expressive
elements in the
output. Analogous to Pollock’s creation of
One: Number 31
redaction should be comparable to Pollock determining whether the effect of an
accident or his movement should be undone or
kept due to improving the creative
plan he conceived. Nevertheless, if the documentation shows too much tweaking,
it may well indicate
that the user did not know how to control the AI to execute
the creative plan, so had to make up with chances.
5. Conclusion
in Mainland China is a case where new technology magnifies
the artistic legacies to copyright. It held, among other things, that
of a partially generative AI should be the creator of the image arising from the
generative AI’s operation due to
the originality of the prompt. This
holding marked that the judicial narrative diverges from the academic narratives
in Mainland
China that AIGC should not be works because they do not contain
originality or they are not human creations.
The Chinese judiciary adopts the policy that generative AIs are ordinary
tools for creation. Without challenging this policy, this
article demonstrates
that the Chinese copyright system provides a legal foundation for recognising
AI-generated images as works of
fine art, although on different grounds than
those presented
in Li v Liu.
Regarding the originality requirement, the definitions of works and works of
fine art point to the holding that the originality of
works of fine art includes
aesthetic effects. The
lex specialis
referring to aesthetic effects as
originality maintains a zero-originality threshold in view of the influence of
Dadaism. Regarding
the human creation requirement, the randomness in the process
of image generation is analogous to the creation of Abstract Expressionist
artwork. Subsequently, users’ operation of generative AI can amount to
creation by effectively tweaking the initial output
The connection between artistic theories and the legal justification for
protecting AI-generated images as works of fine art should
preclude the blanket
extension of copyright protection to all forms of AIGC. The assessment of
originality and authorship should
be made according to the specific
characteristics of each category of AIGC. Consequently, China’s approach
to copyright protection
for AIGC is likely to evolve into a framework that
applies differentiated treatment based on the distinct nature of various types

Mainland China maintains a
unitary judicial system. The SPC is the highest judicial authority. It oversees
the practices of people’s
courts and the specialised courts. The
people’s courts exercise territorial jurisdiction. They are further
divided into high
people’s courts, intermediate people’s courts and
basic people’s courts from high to low in the judicial hierarchy.
specialised courts have jurisdiction over subject matter such as intellectual
property rights, maritime disputes, finance, railway
transport and martial law.
Relevant to intellectual property rights, the Beijing Internet Court that
belongs to the basic people’s courts in the
branch of people’s courts. Intellectual property courts in the branch of
specialised courts are on par with intermediate people’s courts in the
judicial hierarchy.
