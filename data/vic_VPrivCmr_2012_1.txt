Complainant AW v Statutory Authority
[2012] VPrivCmr 1
– Allegation that Statutory Authority (a
regulator accepting complaints from individuals) failed to provide option of

_____________________________________________________________________
The Complainant had a problem with alleged delays and
long waiting times at a particular service provider. The Complainant then
the Statutory Authority (whose role was to regulate service providers
in the industry) to make a complaint.
The Statutory Authority requested the Complainant fill out a complaint form
which requested the personal details of the complainant.
The Complainant explained to the Statutory Authority that he wanted to remain
anonymous in making his complaint. The Statutory Authority
explained to the
Complainant that they could not accept anonymous complaints, as the Statutory
Authority needed to know his details
so they could raise his matter with the
service provider in order to investigate the circumstances of what had allegedly
Information Privacy Principle (IPP) 8
(Anonymity) requires that wherever it is lawful and practicable individuals must
have the option
of not identifying themselves when entering into a transaction
with an organisation.
The Privacy Commissioner
noted that organisations should endeavour, where possible, to permit individuals
to remain anonymous where
it is lawful and practicable. An example could be
where a person reports a public facility in need of repair.
However in the circumstances of this matter, it was not practicable for the
Statutory Authority to provide the Complainant with the
option of remaining
anonymous for the purpose of its complaints process. This is because the
complaint (to the Statutory Authority)
specifically concerned how the
Complainant had been treated by the service provid
As a result,
the Statutory Authority needed to provide the Complainant’s name and
allegations to the service provider so that
the service provider could provide a
proper response to the allegations the Complainant had made.
The Privacy Commissioner stated:
‘Unless the [service provider] knew you were
the Complainant, it could not be expected to provide an informed and accurate
as to why there were delays in relation to [the Complainant’s
individual case].”
The Privacy Commissioner declined the complaint under section 29(1)(a) of the
Act – that the act or practice was not an interference
with the privacy of
the Complainant –as the Commissioner considered it was not practicable to
offer an option of anonymity
in the circumstances (IPP 8).
The Complainant did not refer the complaint to the Victorian Civil and
Administrative Tribunal. The Privacy Commissioner subsequently
dismissed the
complaint under section 29(8) of the Act.
