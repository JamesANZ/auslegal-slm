HIS HONOUR:
1 On 23 October 2025, I published reasons
for judgment in respect of the first defendant’s application by amended
summons dated
2 June 2025 (‘
2 On that occasion, I indicated that it should be
ordered that the application be dismissed, although no such order was then made.
The hearing was adjourned to 28 October 2025 in order that the parties
might propose orders, particularly in respect of
3 As will be apparent from the Primary
reasons, there were two aspects to the first defendant’s application,
namely that –
(a) pursuant to
(Vic), the proceeding
should be transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland (‘
(b) by reference to
Judiciary Act 1903
Judiciary Act
the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction (‘
4 It will also be apparent from the
Primary reasons that –
(a) on 30 May 2025, the
hearing of the application had been adjourned in order that an amended summons
might be filed,
notices served and written submissions
(b) after those steps were taken, the
matter came back on for argument on 28 July
(c) the two issues in the application were
substantial and discrete;
(d) the first defendant and
fourth defendant had carriage of all substantial aspects of the argument in
respect of the transfer issue;
(e) the jurisdictional
issue was only pursued by the first defendant (and that issue included an
argument concerning submission to
(f) the second and third defendants did not file
written submissions or advance any substantial argument in respect of either
5 On 25 October 2025, the parties served
proposed orders. In substance –
(a) the plaintiff sought that
the first defendant pay her costs of the
application;
(b) the first defendant sought that
(i) the first,
second and fourth defendants pay the plaintiff’s costs of the application;
(ii) the third defendant bear its own costs of the
application;
(iii) all parties bear their own costs
of the hearing on 30 May 2025;
(c) the second and third
defendants each sought that their costs of the application be in the proceeding;
(d) the fourth defendant sought that
first defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of the application;
(ii) the ‘plaintiff/first defendant’
pay the fourth defendant’s costs of and occasioned by the adjournment of
hearing on 30 May 2025.
6 At the resumed hearing on 28 October
2025, the parties’ representatives addressed the rationales for the
various orders sought.
7 Counsel for the plaintiff
relevantly submitted that –
(a) the main issue was the
costs of the adjournment on 30 May 2025;
fundamental cause of the adjournment was that the first defendant had raised the
to amend its
(c) the reaction of the plaintiff’s
solicitors had not been perfect, but was understandable;
(d) there had later been a ‘clear
inflection point’ at which ‘the importance of the ...
[jurisdictional issue] was
evidently appreciated and a request for an
adjournment was made [however] ... the response of the first defendant ... was
an accommodating or reasonable [one]
8 Counsel for the plaintiff also applied
to expand the primary order sought such that all defendants would pay the
plaintiff’s
costs in respect of the transfer issue, but the first
defendant would pay the plaintiff’s costs in respect of the jurisdictional
response, senior counsel for the first defendant submitted, relevantly, that
(a) the orders proposed by
the first defendant ‘do justice to both the involvement of the parties and
the outcome’;
(b) more particularly, the
first, second and fourth defendants should have a costs liability in respect of
the transfer issue, although
the third defendant is in a different position
because it did not ‘enter the fray’;
(c) the hearing on 30 May 2025 was not adjourned
because the first defendant was required to amend its summons – rather,
plaintiff was not ready to deal with the
10 The solicitor for the second defendant
submitted that –
(a) the first defendant had
been the ‘moving party’ and should pay the plaintiff’s costs
of the application;
(b) the affidavit of the
solicitor for the second defendant had been prepared in response to an affidavit
of the solicitor for the
first defendant;
second defendant had otherwise ‘provided no written or oral submissions on
the transfer application [and] made absolutely
no comment whatsoever on the
constitutional point’; and
circumstances, the second defendant’s position was akin to that of the
third defendant, which had not entered the
11 The solicitor for the third defendant
said that its position was similar to that of the second defendant and that no
costs should be made against the third
for the fourth defendant relevantly submitted that –
(a) the fourth defendant
accepted that costs ought follow the event;
that regard, the first defendant should pay the plaintiff’s costs as the
fourth defendant, in particular, had not brought
application;
(c) that said, if the Court were to
consider that the fourth defendant should share a portion of the costs, any such
order should
differentiate between the transfer and jurisdictional issues and,
if the Court were so minded, the fourth defendant should share
a liability with
the first defendant in respect of the transfer issue only, which, it was said,
should account for ’50 per
cent of the overall
(d) the ‘late
adjournment’ on 30 May 2025 had been entirely
13 In respect of the latter point,
counsel clarified that the costs thrown away essentially amounted to the brief
fees for the appearances
of both senior and junior counsel on 30 May 2025
as well as the costs of the instructing solicitor travelling to attend that

to the suggestion that any substantive costs
orders made should be stayed
pending the final determination or resolution of the
proceeding.
submissions to which I have referred were advanced against the background of the
affidavits filed in respect of the hearing
on 30 May 2025, in particular, as
well as the accepted principles relating to the making of orders for

Pursuant to
Supreme Court Act
, the Court has a broad
costs discretion. In exercising its discretion, the Court is entitled to look
to the realities of the litigation
and it will attempt to do ‘substantial
justice’ between the parties. Accordingly, while the general position is
costs should follow the event, such an order may not be appropriate in
every case. In particular, where there is a multiplicity
of issues, and mixed
success has been enjoyed by the parties, the Court may take a pragmatic approach
in framing the order for costs,

of success) of the parties on an issues

from the first defendant’s solicitor highlighted that the reply

consented to an email being sent to the Court to confirm the availability

instructions would be sought concerning the ‘viability
of the proposed 30
May 2025 date noting the significant and substantive new points of law
raised’. The email reserved the
‘right’ to ‘take up the
First Defendant’s invitation to make submissions in
on the same day, the plaintiff’s solicitor forwarded the email from the
first defendant’s solicitor together with
the reply submissions to senior
and junior counsel then briefed on behalf of the plaintiff. Senior counsel
seems to have responded
suggesting that the solicitor ‘seek the advice of
a junior barrister specialising ... [in constitutional law]’. Senior
counsel also said, in substance, that she would ‘make enquiries and
suggest an appropriate
barrister’.
24 April 2025, the plaintiff’s solicitor emailed the solicitors for the
other parties to confirm agreement with the proposed
email being sent to the
Court confirming the availability of the parties for a hearing on 30 May
23 That said, another of the plaintiff’s
solicitors subsequently deposed that –
At this stage, ATB [the plaintiff’s solicitors] had not received any
advice on the
issue, was unfamiliar with it, and did not realise the
effect it might have on the viability of a 30 May 2025 hearing

first defendant thereafter sent the agreed email to the

solicitor that same
Monday, 19 May 2025, the solicitor for the plaintiff emailed the solicitors for
the other parties as follows –
We have briefed counsel to prepare submissions and will be in a position to file
and serve same prior to the hearing listed for 30
27 At that point, the plaintiff’s
solicitor had not yet received the advice of junior counsel, although
‘preliminary advice’
was received later the same day. In that
connection, it is deposed that –
... after receiving that advice ATB formed the view that we needed to seek an
adjournment of the current proceeding, if the
issue was pressed, on the
basis that:

consideration, research and the preparation of detailed submissions

28 Notwithstanding that position, it
seems that the solicitors for the plaintiff did not send any relevant letter to
the solicitors
for the first defendant and other parties until Thursday, 22 May
2025 at 3.30pm. In that letter, in substance, the plaintiff’s
stated that ‘constitutional issues’ were raised,
Judiciary Act
was engaged and, accordingly, the hearing would need to be
adjourned. The letter also proposed that the plaintiff file further written
submissions in response to the first defendant’s new

order to enliven the requirement to deliver a notice pursuant to

Constitution
” or “involving its interpretation”. In our view,
although the arguments put by our client in reliance on
refer to matters in which the High Court has original jurisdiction which
indirectly incorporates
Constitution
, the issue raised by our client
is not one arising under the
Constitution
or involving its interpretation. It
is a question of the effect of
Judiciary Act
and the interpretation
of that provision. On that basis, a
notice is not required and there can
be no basis to adjourn the hearing of the Summons.

the solicitors for the plaintiff and first
defendant. It is sufficient to note
(a) on Monday, 26 May 2025 at
10:40am, the plaintiff’s solicitor stated that the first defendant’s
new point was a complex
one, the plaintiff intended to defend it for
‘reasons which include constitutional reasons’ and, accordingly, the
were of the view that ‘

and tone more likely to provoke confrontation
than co-operation. Among other
things, it was contended that a party may not ‘simply assert’ that
there is a constitutional
matter for the purposes of
Tuesday, 27 May 2025 at 8:44am, the plaintiff’s solicitor replied in terms
that were generally measured and included
reference to the preliminary advice of
counsel to the effect that
notices would need to be prepared
‘because the proceeding involves a constitutional point, being whether
Judiciary Act
] can have the operation contended for by the
first defendant, consistently with the right to proceed which is conferred by
the Australian
Constitution
’. That said, the solicitor’s letter
included a suggestion that the first defendant could withdraw the argument
– which was plainly not going to
afternoon at 1:29pm, the first defendant’s solicitor responded in terms
that continued the tone to which I have earlier
referred and included assertions
(i) the basis
upon which a s 78B notice was required had not been
‘articulated’;
(ii) a s 78B notice was
‘not required’; and
(iii) the plaintiff
was required to articulate ‘compelling reasons’ why s 78B was
(e) that evening at 6:42pm,
the plaintiff’s solicitor responded with a range of argumentative gambits,
including that –
(i) the first
defendant’s new point had not been
(ii) the first defendant had not explained
its delay in raising the new point;
plaintiff had been ‘taken entirely by
(iv) in light of the unreasonable
attitude displayed by the first defendant in correspondence, the plaintiff would
‘oppose the
late attempt by the First Defendant to introduce the
issue’ or any application to amend its defence;
(v) if the first defendant were permitted to
amend its defence, the plaintiff would be ‘forced to seek an
adjournment’;
(f) in that context, the
plaintiff’s solicitor also explained further that –
We foreshadow that, if the First Defendant is ultimately permitted to raise the
Judiciary Act
issue, we intend to argue in response that:
As a matter of
statutory construction,
Judiciary Act
does not have the effect
contented for by the First Defendant; and
Further and in
the alternative,
Judiciary Act
does not have the operation
contended for by the First defendant, in light of the right to proceed which is
conferred by the Australian
Constitution
. That is, because the
Constitution
itself confers federal jurisdiction on a Court (here, the Supreme Court of
does not prevent a plaintiff from bringing a contract or tort
claim against a state in any court with subject matter jurisdiction

Constitution

constitutional point is genuinely

outlined in the Primary reasons, essential steps were subsequently taken prior
to the application coming back on for hearing
I have earlier noted, in respect of the costs of the adjournment on 30 May 2025
(a) the plaintiff essentially
sought her costs with particular reference to the stance adopted by the first
defendant in correspondence
on and after 23 May
(b) the first defendant appeared to maintain
its contention that each party should bear their own costs and otherwise sought
to apportion
blame to the plaintiff;
(c) the second
and third defendants sought no specific order other than that their costs of the
application should be in the proceeding;
fourth defendant sought that the ‘plaintiff/first defendant’ pay its
costs thrown away, particularly the costs
of retaining senior and junior counsel
to appear on that occasion together with the travel and associated costs of the
38 In my view –
(a) neither the second nor
third defendant contributed to the situation to which I have
(b) the plaintiff bears a palpable
responsibility as –
(i) on 16 April
2025, her solicitors appear to have been informed and therefore must have
appreciated that it was necessary to obtain
advice from a barrister practising
in ‘constitutional
such barrister appears to have been briefed until 9 May
(iii) nonetheless, on 24 April 2025, the
plaintiff’s solicitors confirmed that the hearing could go ahead on 30 May
on 19 May 2025, indicated that relevant written submissions would be
filed prior to that hearing;
(iv) realistically, the
plaintiff had time between 16 April and 30 May 2025 in order that any necessary
steps might be taken, including
the taking of advice, the service of
notices and the preparation of relevant written
submissions;
(v) however, significant time was
allowed to pass until the plaintiff’s solicitors emailed the other parties
on 22 May 2025
advising, in effect, of a significant change in position shortly
prior to the listed hearing date that then provoked the suspicions
solicitors for the first defendant; and
correspondence, the plaintiff’s solicitors initially adopted a measured
and reasonable approach only to later descend
into a range of points that,
realistically, could only inflame the situation and further distract the
practitioners from the real
issues presented;
(c) on the other hand, the
first defendant must also bear a significant responsibility as its response was
unduly rigid, suspicious,
aggressive and unrealistic; in particular
(i) the implicit
insinuation that the solicitor for the plaintiff was doing no more than simply
(and impermissibly) asserting that
there was a ‘constitutional
(ii) the absolute contention that a
notice was ‘not required’;
associated assertion there could be ‘no basis’ for an
adjournment;
(iv) the later assertion that it was necessary
for the plaintiff to articulate ‘compelling reasons’ why the
point involved a ‘matter arising under the
Constitution
involving its
interpretation’;
(d) more broadly, neither the
solicitors for the plaintiff nor the first defendant should have ignored the
perfectly reasonable correspondence
of the solicitor for the fourth
39 In the circumstances –
(a) there should be no order
as to the costs of the plaintiff and first defendant of and relating to the
hearing on 30 May 2025;
(b) the relevant costs of
the second and third defendants should be dealt with generally in respect of the
costs of the overall application;
plaintiff and first defendant should each bear 50% of an overall liability for
the fourth defendant’s costs thrown away
in respect of the hearing on 30
May 2025, specifically limited to –
(i) the brief
fees for the appearances of senior and junior counsel on 30 May 2025;
(ii) the travel costs for the attendance by the
solicitor of the fourth defendant at the hearing on 30 May 2025 together with
costs of him instructing on that occasion.
40 That brings me to the costs of the
application more broadly.
41 In that regard, subject
to what I have already said about the costs of the hearing on 30 May 2025,
the costs should follow the
event and, accordingly, the plaintiff should have
her standard costs of the application.
42 That said,
as I have noted –
(a) the application
ultimately involved the determination of the discrete issues of transfer and
(b) the fourth defendant submitted
that if the Court were to consider that it should share a portion of the costs
of the application,
that should relate only to the transfer issue which, it was
submitted, should amount to no more than 50% of the overall costs of
the amended
(c) the first defendant acknowledged that
the third defendant had not ‘entered the
(d) the solicitor for the second
defendant sought to explain its actions and submitted that its position should
be considered to be
akin to that of the third defendant;
(e) all parties acknowledged, either expressly
or by silence, that it would be appropriate to stay any substantive costs orders
the final determination or resolution of the proceeding.
43 In the Primary reasons, I described
the transfer issue as having been in issue between the plaintiff and all four
and later noted that
the legal representatives of the second and third defendants had adopted the
relevant submissions of the first
since heard and considered the submissions of senior counsel for the first
defendant as well as the solicitors for the second
and third defendants, I
accept that –
(a) the preparation of the
affidavit of the second defendant’s solicitor is
explicable;
(b) neither that step nor the
indications of the solicitors for the second and third defendant in oral
argument amounted to either
party entering the fray in any material way in
respect of either issue in the application.
45 In the circumstances, it seems
appropriate for those parties who actively agitated each of the issues against
the plaintiff to
bear the costs of all relevant elements of that
46 It follows that –
(a) the liability for the
plaintiff’s costs of the determination of the jurisdictional issue
(including the issue of submission
to jurisdiction, or waiver) should be borne
by the first defendant;
(b) the liability for the
plaintiff’s costs of the determination of the transfer issue should be
borne by the first and fourth
defendants and not by either the second or third
defendants; and
(c) the second and third
defendants’ costs of the amended summons, including their costs in
relation to the hearing on 30 May
2025, should be their costs in the
proceeding.
47 From that point, I accept that there
is utility in identifying appropriate apportionments of the various areas of
liability for
the plaintiff’s costs of the amended summons (excluding, of
course, the plaintiff’s costs of and relating to the hearing
2025 – in respect of which there will be no order).
48 Accordingly, doing the best I can –
(a) the liability for the
plaintiff’s costs of the determination of the jurisdictional issue is
likely to amount to 40% of the
plaintiff’s relevant costs incurred in
defence of the application (excluding the plaintiff’s costs of and
relating to
the hearing on 30 May 2025);
liability for the plaintiff’s costs of the determination of the transfer
issue is likely to amount to 60% of the plaintiff’s
relevant costs of the
defence of the application (similarly excluding the plaintiff’s costs of
and relating to the hearing
on 30 May 2025);
first and fourth defendants contributed equally to the prosecution of the
transfer issue;
(d) accordingly
(i) the first
defendant should bear 70% of the plaintiff’s relevant costs incurred in
defence of the application (that is, 40%
relating to the jurisdictional issue
and half of 60% relating to the transfer issue);
(ii) the fourth defendant should bear 30% of the
plaintiff’s relevant costs incurred in defence of the application (that
half of 60% relating to the transfer
49 More broadly, I accept that it is
appropriate to stay the effect of all substantive costs orders made in respect
of the application
until the final determination or resolution of the
proceeding.
50 Orders giving effect to the above
will accompany these reasons when both are emailed to the parties.
