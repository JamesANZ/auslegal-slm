Presiding Member
DECISION: The Tribunal affirms the decision under review not to grant the
Applicant an entry permit to enable him to remain in Australia.
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
On 18 December 1995, SLR applied to this Tribunal for a review of a decision
made by a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration
and Ethnic Affairs (the
Minister) at the then Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (the
Department) on 20 September 1994
to refuse his application for a Class 816
(Special (Permanent)) entry permit to enable him to remain in Australia. This
was affirmed by the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) on
20 October 1995. SLR has standing to bring this application to the
Tribunal for determination, pursuant to
Section 347
Migration Act
The Tribunal affirmed the decision on 28 November 1996 to refuse SLR the permit
applied for (see
IRT Decision 28 November 1996). This decision
was appealed to the Federal Court of Australia. The appeal was successful and
matter was remitted back to the Tribunal with the consent of the parties on
10 July 1997 for reconsideration. Reconsideration by
this Tribunal is
therefore a de novo reconsideration of the original application for a Class
816/818 entry permit.
SLR (the Applicant) was born in Poland in 1949 and is a citizen of that
country. He is divorced. The Applicant came to Australia
on 24 September 1988
as a visitor and was granted a temporary entry permit valid for 6 months. His
entry permit was extended to
allow him to remain in Australia until 24 June
On 14 July 1994 the Applicant applied to remain in Australia under the
1 November 1993 concessions announced by the Minister by lodging
completed application Form 1816/1818 with the Department. At the time of the
application he was 44 years of age. He stated in
the application form that he
had completed his schooling in 1966 in Poland and had obtained qualifications
"electrical mechanic"
"specialised school"
The Applicant noted in the application form that he was
"unemployed"
the time. In the form he referred to his parents in Poland and his brother and
sister in Australia as his
"other family members"
Other material relating to the Applicant's application was made available to
the Department.
A letter from the Department dated 4 August 1995 to the Applicant's advisers
referred in part to his having failed the STEP test
in English on 2 occasions
"firstly in November 1994 and then in May 1995. Subclause 816.732(3) of the
Migration Regulations states that applicants must pass
the English proficiency
tests nominated by the Minister on the first or second attempt"
The application form completed by the Applicant is the approved form for both a
Class 816 (special (permanent)) entry permit and
a Class 818 (Highly Qualified
On-Shore (permanent)) entry permit. The primary decision maker and the MIRO
review officer treated
the application as one by the Applicant for both a Class
816 and a Class 818 entry permit.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
On 20 September 1995 a delegate of the Minister rejected the Applicant's
application for an entry permit to enable him to remain
in Australia. The
delegate found that the Applicant was unable to satisfy clauses 816.732(2) and
(3) of the Migration (1993) Regulations.
As well the delegate found that the
Applicant did not meet the criteria for a Class 818 entry permit either.
The Applicant was notified of the decision by certified mail on 20 September
The Applicant applied for review of that decision to MIRO on 24 October 1995,
the fee being paid on the same day.
The MIRO review officer affirmed the earlier decision not to grant the
Applicant a Class 816 or a Class 818 entry permit on 22 November
The review officer found in part that the Applicant was unable to satisfy
subclauses 816.732(2) and (3) of the Regulations.
As well the review officer did not find that the Applicant satisfied the
requirements for a Class 818 entry permit. The review officer
I determine that the applicant fails to meet the prescribed criteria set out in
Parts 816 and 818 of Schedule 2 in the Migration
(1993) Regulations. As the
grant of a transitional visa based on the requirement for a Class 830 entry
permit and Class 154 visa
are dependent on the applicant remaining an
applicant, or satisfying the criteria, for Parts 816 or 818 I have also
determined that
the applicant does not meet the criteria for either an (sic)
Class 830 entry permit or a Class 154 visa. I therefore affirm the
decision to refuse the application. This means that the application for review
has not been successful.
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
As a result of the coming into force of the
Migration Reform Act 1992
1 September 1994 Australian migration law has undergone significant
changes. In accordance with
regulation 23
Migration Reform
(Transitional Provisions) Regulations
, the Applicant's application in this
case, if successful, will now result in the grant of a transitional (permanent)
visa under the
new law. For most purposes this will resemble the entry permit
that would have been granted under the law in force before 1 September
However, the application is still to be decided according to the criteria that
applied to the entry permit for which the application
was originally made. The
Regulations which are applicable in this case are therefore the Migration
(1993) Regulations (the Regulations).
The criteria for a Class 816 entry permit are set out in Schedule 2 of the
Regulations.
In short this entry permit was available to certain people under the age of 45
at 1 November 1993 who were granted a visa on or before
12 March 1992 and who
had used that visa to travel to and enter Australia on or before 1 November
1993, had applied for refugee status,
or had applied for and apparently met, or
had been granted, the humanitarian concessions available to nationals of Sri
the former Yugoslavia. In order to qualify under this class
applicants must meet requirements in respect of certain qualifications
involvement in a business. Applicants relying on qualifications must, on 1
November 1993:
* have obtained, or completed the requirements of, a post-secondary educational
qualification in Australia following an accredited
course leading to a trade
certificate, advanced certificate, associate diploma, diploma, degree or higher
* have held an overseas technical qualification or general academic
qualification assessed by the National Office of Overseas Skills
Recognition
(NOOSR) as comparable to an Australian associate diploma, diploma, degree or
higher degree; or
* have held an overseas trade qualification, or have work experience, assessed
as meeting Australian education or training standards
for that trade by the
Department of Industrial Relations (DIR), or, if DIR is unable to make an
assessment, by the State or Territory
authority that the Minister decides is
appropriate or if neither that Department or State/Territory authority is able
assessment, by the Minister; or
* have been enrolled during the 1993 academic year in an accredited course
leading to a trade certificate, advanced certificate,
associate diploma,
diploma, degree or higher degree and have met academic progress requirements of
the institution at which they
were enrolled.
Applicants relying on participation in a business must, throughout the period
from 2 November 1992 to 1 November 1993 (inclusive)
have had an interest,
whether as a sole proprietor, a partner or a shareholder of at least 25% of the
issued capital of a corporation,
in a business which operated regularly and
continuously throughout that period, complied with all relevant laws and
provided employment
equivalent to 2886 person-hours of work for persons other
than the applicant, the applicant's spouse or a child or parent of the
At the time of decision applicants must demonstrate an ability to communicate
in English in a mix of social and work situations,
either on the basis of
studies undertaken in English or on the basis of one of a number of tests of
proficiency in English.
The criteria for a Class 818 entry permit are also set out in Schedule 2 of the
Regulations.
* In short this entry permit was available to people under the age of 45 at 1
November 1993 who were granted a visa before 12 March
1992 and who:
* were undertaking postgraduate studies at an Australian post secondary
educational institution on 1 November 1993 and had satisfied
academic progress
requirements of that educational institution; or
* in the case of people who held Australian Bachelor degrees or overseas
qualifications assessed by NOOSR as comparable to such degrees
undertaking studies at an Australian post secondary educational institution in
an accredited course for a Bachelor degree
on 1 November 1993 and had satisfied
academic progress requirements of that educational institution; or
* in the case of people who had previously completed a Bachelor degree or a
higher degree in Australia - were undertaking, on 1 November
1993, or had
completed during the 1993 academic year, further study, practical training or
work experience required to obtain professional
registration, licensing or
admission; or
* were the holders of postgraduate or post-doctoral research positions in
Australian academic or research institutions on 1 November
1993, having been
appointed to those positions on the basis of a postgraduate or post-doctoral
qualification awarded to the applicant
in Australia.
It is a criterion in this class that the applicant must not have been
financially assisted in his or her studies in Australia by
the Commonwealth or
the government of another country.
EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS
The file of the Department has been made available to the Tribunal. It
contains in part the Applicant's application and supporting
material. As well
the Tribunal had the Tribunal's file A98/00059.
A hearing of this matter was held in Sydney on 17 December 1998. The Applicant
attended and gave evidence on oath.
In summary the Applicant stated:
* He came to Australia to visit his family here and have a holiday

applications to remain here including a refugee application.

* On 1 November 1993 he was not working or studying. He was reporting to the
Department's Parramatta office.
* He is self taught in English and although he sat for the STEP test twice he

* He has not formally studied in Australia.
* He is not in a close relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent
* He is aware that Trade Recognition Australia (TRA) have determined that
neither his overseas trade qualification or work experience
Australian education or training standards for this trade.
* He did not attend a further trade test arranged with TRA as he was
frightened"
* He does not want to undergo another assessment with TRA. He does not wish to
sit a trade test or be involved in an examination.
He has not worked in his
trade in Australia and the requirements here are different from Poland.
* He reiterated and confirmed he did not wish to sit a trade test or do an
examination as it was
"apprehensive"
not succeed. It was his final word that he did not want to sit another test
* He was born in Poland in 1949.
* He has not left Australia since coming to Australia in 1988.
The Tribunal notes that by letter dated 16 September 1996 TRA advised the
Applicant that he was
"not eligible for recognition as a tradesperson in
. On 14 April 1998 TRA notified the Tribunal that the Applicant
did not satisfy the Australian requirement for his trade
"as at 1 November
. On 22 April 1998 TRA advised the Tribunal in part as follows:
"... under clause 816.721(2)(ii) of the Migration Regulations Mr Rainin would
not have held qualifications and experience meeting
the Australian education or
training standards for his trade at that time nor as at 1 November 1993."
The Applicant was advised of this finding of TRA by letter dated 11 May 1998.
The Tribunal again contacted TRA regarding this matter
on 17 August 1998. TRA
indicated that the Applicant would need to sit a test to have his skills
reassessed again. Further contact
was made with the Applicant in this matter.
On 22 December 1998 the Tribunal returned the Applicant's cheque for TRA
indicating in
part that as the Applicant did not wish to be re-examined by TRA
it would proceed to a decision in this matter.
Class 816 Entry Permit
From the evidence and material before it, the Tribunal finds:
* The Applicant lodged his application for a Class 816 entry permit on 14 July
1994 on approved Form 1816. He satisfies clause 816.512
and 816.711(1) of the
Regulations;
* He was born in October 1949, and had not turned 45 before 1 November 1993.
He satisfies clause 816.721(1)(a)(i) of the Regulations;
* The Applicant's application for refugee status was recorded by the Department
as having been received on or before 1 November 1993.
He satisfies clause
816.721(4) of the Regulations.
Clause 816.131 of the Regulations provides that:
816.131 In this Part:
"accredited course" means a tertiary course that is:
(a) accredited as a tertiary course by a Commonwealth, State or Territory
authority; or
(b) offered and accredited by a tertiary institution that is authorised to
accredit its own courses by a Commonwealth, State or Territory
The Applicant had not completed an "
accredited course"
in Australia by 1
November 1993. The Applicant completed his schooling in Poland.
It was submitted that the Applicant had qualifications and work experience as
"electro mechanic"
and that this should be accepted as meeting the
requirements of paragraph 816.721(2)(b)(ii) of the Regulations.
The Tribunal accepts on the evidence and material before it that the
Applicant's occupation as an
"electro mechanic"
is considered a
in Australia. The Tribunal notes that TRA (the Department of
Industrial Relations) has on a number of occasions indicated that as
November 1993 the Applicant's overseas technical qualifications and/or work
experience did not meet the Australian education
or training standards for that
trade. This was so even after TRA was requested by the Tribunal to apply the
specific test set out
in the Regulations. As the Department of Industrial
Relations is the assessing body referred to in clause 816.721(2)(b)(ii) of the
Regulations, the Tribunal is bound by its assessment. Furthermore, the
Tribunal endeavoured to have the Applicant re-examined in
relation to the TRA
assessment however the Applicant refused to be reassessed by it.
In the circumstances the Tribunal finds that the Applicant does not satisfy
subclauses 816.721(2)(a), (b) or (c) of the Regulations.
The Applicant has
worked as an
in Australia. He has not been involved in his
own business here. He therefore does not satisfy subclause 816.721(3) of the
Regulations.
Given these findings, it is not necessary to consider the application for the
Class 816 entry permit further. However the Tribunal
notes that the Applicant
had failed the STEP tests on 2 occasions and may not satisfy regulation 816.732
of the Regulations.
In the circumstances the Tribunal finds that the Applicant is unable to meet
the requirements or criteria for a Class 816 entry permit.
Class 818 Entry Permit
The Applicant is to be also considered for a Class 818 entry permit.
The Applicant has no degree, diploma or the like from an Australian educational
institution. He has not undertaken any postgraduate
course or studies in
Australia as defined in clause 818.131 of the Regulations, nor was it submitted
that he had.
As the Applicant is unable to satisfy the criteria in regulation 818.721(2)(a)
or the other clauses of that regulation he is accordingly
not entitled to the
Class 818 entry permit for which he has applied.
Pursuant to regulation 2.29(1C) of the Regulations an application for the entry
permits applied for by the Applicant is deemed to
also be an application for a
Class 830 (1 November 1993 (processing)) entry permit. The requirements for
this permit are contained
in Part 830 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations.
However, the Applicant is not entitled to a Class 830 entry permit as he is
unable to satisfy one of the requirements set out in
regulations 830.734 or
The Tribunal affirms the decision under review not to grant the Applicant an
entry permit to enable him to remain in Australia.
