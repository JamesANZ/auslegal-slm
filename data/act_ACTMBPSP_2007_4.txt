Dr PD [2007] ACTMBPSP 4 (1 January 2007)
Medical Board of the Australian Capital Territory
Professional Standards Panel Outcomes
The subject matter of the Inquiry consists of allegations that Dr PD:
failed to take an adequate patient history;
failed to adequately communication with multiple patients;
completed prescriptions
without taking an adequate history and undertaking a physical
examination; and
failed to maintain adequate clinical records.
In relation to the first patient, Dr PD expressed his view to the
panel that he maintained adequate records of the history and
consultation
he had with the patient given that he had not been required
to make an initial diagnosis or determine appropriate treatment for
this patient as she had been previously diagnosed and prescribed the
drug and the dose by another medical practitioner. He was
view that all this patient came to see him for was
�...purely for continuation of a medication that was adequately managing a known condition that she suffered from.�
The panel noted that Dr PD did in fact record that the dose was in his
view �excessive� but nothing more is noted in the patient
relation to his consultation, assessment or conversation with this
patient which should have taken place in order to
determine whether or
not he should in fact prescribe what she was asking for.
For Dr PD to satisfy the panel that he took an adequate patient
history he should be able to rely on the contemporaneous notes he
when he saw the patient. The notes in this case do not support his
argument that an adequate history was taken as they do
not contain the
examination and assessment of the patient in support
of him prescribing a
drug in a dose that he himself notes is �excessive�. It is not
enough to say that
�I knew everything I needed to know�
patient was not coming to me for an initial diagnosis of depression
therefore I am not required to undertake an examination
The one observation made by Dr PD recorded in the notes is that it was an
�excessive dose�
was being sought
it is because of this that the panel is of the view that he might
preferably have contacted the doctor who initially prescribed
at that dosage and gained further information on the patient�s medical
In relation to the allegation regarding poor communication with
patients, Dr PD conceded that in this instance he raised his voice
her but did not shout at her. The panel formed the view that
whether or not someone is shouting can be a subjective assessment
any event the Code of Conduct requires a doctor to
treat every patient politely and considerately.
In relation to a second patient, a prescription was sought by the
patient who was from interstate. The patient presented in Dr PD�s
the waiting room requesting a prescription because her current supply
would not last until her return home. Dr PD being unfamiliar
this brand name went to his consulting room to check what it was.
He then returned to the waiting room and declined to prescribe
for this patient.
The patient was persistent in her request for the medication and
�made a big fuss� and Dr PD felt pressured into giving the patient
she wanted. While the quantity of the prescribed drug was not
large, the panel considers that it should not have been prescribed
all without a full consultation involving an adequate history and
examination and a check by telephone with the patient�s physician
general practitioner. Based on the
Standards Statement on the Prescribing of Benzodiazepines
Board would be concerned if a medical practitioner prescribed such a
drug which is not required for the medical treatment of
the patient and
Dr PD should have verified this by a combination of history, examination
and verification with her medical practitioner.
Dr PD started this consultation in his waiting room. He
told the panel that it is his practice to see patients without an
appointment
if they simply want a new prescription for a drug that they
are already taking and that he tries to see these patients in between
his scheduled appointments. This usually occurs in the waiting
room and he sees it as a service he provides to patients. The
was of the view that this practice may contravene the Code of
Conduct requirements in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6.
In this situation the patient alleges that Dr PD discussed her
private details in front of others in the waiting room and did not
her into a consulting room to discuss why he would not prescribe this
drug for her. From the transcript Dr PD acknowledges
this is the
case. There were four other people in the waiting room at the time
the conversation took place regarding the patient�s
request and his
refusal to prescribe the drug initially. The panel was of the view
that the patient�s personal health information
was disclosed by Dr PD
to the extent that he referred to the drug she was seeking by name,
referring to �addiction� and after initially
saying he never prescribed
that drug to then saying he would only prescribe 10 tablets for
her. None of this information should
have been disclosed in front
of other patients in the waiting room. It would have been
appropriate for Dr PD to take the patient
into a consulting room and
explain this to her in private and in a courteous manner.
The Panel concluded that the allegations made by each patient are substantiated to the extent recorded above.
The Panel found that Dr PD:
had breached the required standard of practice by engaging in
inappropriate behaviour in contravention of the Code of Conduct in
relation to both patients;
had breached the required
standard of practice by disclosing personal health information in
relation to a patient in contravention
Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997
thereby contravening the
Health Professionals Regulation 2004
had breached the required
standard of practice by failing to maintain adequate clinical records;
The panel cautioned Dr PD and required that he complete a
professional development course acceptable to the Board relating to the
maintenance of medical records by general practitioners. The panel
further required that Dr PD meet monthly for a period of 12
months with
a general practitioner mentor nominated by the Board so that he may
discuss his practice and the changes he is making
in it and in the
course of this the matters that have given rise to this Inquiry should
be made known to the mentor.
