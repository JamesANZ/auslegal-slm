STATEMENT OF DECISION AND REASONS
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
is an application for review of a decision made by a delegate of the Minister
for Immigration to refuse to grant the applicant
a Protection visa under
Migration Act 1958
applicant, who claims to be a citizen of China, arrived in Australia [in]
January 2008 on a Chinese passport in the name of [Mr
A] and as the holder of a
subclass 771 Transit visa issued to [Mr A]. This visa expired [in] January 2008.
applicant thereafter remained in Australia as an unlawful non-citizen until he
was granted a Bridging visa [in] February 2008
in association with his first
application for a Protection visa. He was granted a further Bridging visa [in]
August 2008 which expired
[in] November 2008. He thereafter remained in
Australia as an unlawful non-citizen until he was granted a Bridging visa [in]
2013 in association with his second application for a Protection visa.
He is currently the holder of a Bridging visa issued [in]
January 2014.
applicant lodged his first application for a Protection visa with the Department
of Immigration and Citizenship (the Department)
[in] February 2008. He was
interviewed by the Department [in] April 2008. The delegate refused to grant the
visa [in] May 2008. The
applicant applied to the Tribunal on 23 May 2008 for
review of that decision. He attended a hearing before the Tribunal (differently
constituted) on 15 July 2008. On 17 July 2008, the Tribunal affirmed the
Department’s decision. [In] August 2008, the applicant
applied to the
Federal Magistrates Court (as it was then called) for judicial review of the
Tribunal’s decision. [In] October
2008, the Federal Magistrates Court
dismissed the application for judicial review.

present arguments. The Tribunal hearing was conducted with

issue that arises on review is whether Australia has protection obligations to
the applicant under the complementary protection
RELEVANT LAW
criteria for a Protection visa are set out in
of the Act and Schedule 2 to
Migration Regulations 1994
(the Regulations). An applicant for the visa must
meet one of the alternative criteria in s.36(2)(a), (aa), (b), or (c). That is,
the applicant is either a person in respect of whom Australia has protection
obligations under the ‘refugee’ criterion,
or on other
‘complementary protection’ grounds, or is a member of the same
family unit as such a person and that person
holds a Protection visa of the same
Refugee criterion
36(2)(a) provides that a criterion for a Protection visa is that the applicant
for the visa is a non-citizen in Australia
in respect of whom the Minister is
satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the 1951 Convention
relating to the Status
of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to
the Status of Refugees (together, the Refugees Convention, or the Convention).
Complementary protection criterion
a person is found not to meet the refugee criterion in s.36(2)(a), he or she may
nevertheless meet the criteria for the grant of
a Protection visa if he or she
is a non-citizen in Australia in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied
Australia has protection
obligations because the Minister has substantial
grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the
being removed from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real
risk that he or she will suffer significant harm: s.36(2)(aa)
complementary protection criterion’).
Section 499 Ministerial Direction
accordance with Ministerial Direction No.56, made under s.499 of the Act, the
Tribunal is required to take account of policy guidelines
prepared by the
Department of Immigration –PAM3 Refugee and humanitarian - Complementary
Protection Guidelines and PAM3 Refugee
and humanitarian - Refugee Law Guidelines
– and any country information assessment prepared by the Department of
Foreign Affairs
and Trade expressly for protection status determination
purposes, to the extent that they are relevant to the decision under
consideration.
Further application for a Protection visa made
before 28 May 2014
48A imposes a bar on a non-citizen making a further application for a Protection
visa while in the migration zone in circumstances
where the non-citizen has made
an application for a Protection visa which has been refused. The Full Federal
has held at [38] that the operation of s.48A, as it stood
at the time of this visa application, is confined to the making of a further
application for a Protection visa which duplicates an earlier unsuccessful
application for a Protection visa, in the sense that both
applications raise the
same essential criterion for the grant of a Protection
CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS
applicant’s claims in his first application for a Protection visa are
summarised as follows:
He is from China
and his “genuine name” is [as stated]. He arrived in Australia [in]
January 2008 on a passport in the
name of [Mr A].
Fujian Province. He got married in 1981 and has [children]. He was fined 10,000
RMB for breaching China’s birth control
laws. He had difficulty supporting
his family whilst working as a [occupation] and was in debt.
In 1992, he got
to know [Mr B] who ran [a] farm. He arranged for him to work in the [farm] and
assisted him to repay his debt. He
taught him how to run the farm and conduct
business in the [industry].
In October 1994,
he, [Mr B] and some friends established a new [farm] called “[name
deleted]”. The capital required was
1,000,000 RMB. He was appointed as the
legal representative.
Around the same
time in 1994, [Mr B] started practising Falun Gong. [Mr B] was not in good
health and suffered from several [illnesses].
His health improved after he
practised Falun Gong and he became a devoted Falun Gong practitioner.
He is not a
Falun Gong practitioner. He tried to help [Mr B] so that he could have more time
to practise Falun Gong. [Mr B] established
a Falun Gong training centre in his
village and organised for some Falun Gong practitioners to practice on the
In 1999, Falun
Gong was made illegal. On 20 July 1999, the Fuqing Public Security Bureau (PSB)
started action against Falun Gong practitioners
including [Mr B]. He had a close
[friend] who worked at the PSB and tipped him off. He passed on the information
to [Mr B] and he
managed to escape to a small village in Hunan Proving before
the Police could arrest him.
From July to
October 1999, the Police from the PSB questioned him many times to ascertain [Mr
B]’s whereabouts. After that,
the Police rarely went to see him. He kept
in touch with [Mr B] secretly after he went into hiding in a village in [Town
County in Hunan Province. He visited [Mr B] several times to give him
money, clothes, food and other necessities. There were about
10 Falun Gong
practitioners from Fujian Province living in Hunan Province and had many
difficulties as they had no source of income.
In order to help them, he and [Mr
B] decided to open [a] farm in Hunan Province.
In March 2000,
an ell farm was established in the village in [Town 1] and he was the legal
representative. [Mr B], who pretended to
be his cousin, was in charge of the
daily operation of the [farm] and he recruited Falun Gong practitioners as
workers on the farm.
He supplied [livestock], feed, financial support and
“pushed” the sale of [the livestock] in the market.
On 23 January
2001, some Falun Gong practitioners were reported to have set themselves on fire
at Tiananmen Square in Beijing but
it was obviously a “con game”
done by the Chinese government. [Mr B] and the other Falun Gong practitioners on
were angry. [Mr B] organised to have an open letter written by him to
be distributed in the Hunan area. Although the letter was anonymous,
discovered by the PSB.
[In] February
2001, the [farm] in the village in [Town 1] was sealed by the PSB. He, [Mr B]
and the other Falun Gong practitioners
were arrested. During the first week,
they were detained at the same detention centre in different cells. Thereafter,
were transferred to an unknown labour camp.
any Falun Gong activities. When he was interrogated
by the Police he denied all
allegations. He was tortured by the Police to make him confess his crimes. He
firmly denied all allegations.
The Police had no evidence against him. [In]
April 2001, the Police sent him to a labour [camp] as his brain “needed to
cleaned completely”. He was subject to hard labour in the labour camp
for more than 7 years. During that period he was tortured,
mistreated,
humiliated, persecuted, denied legal assistance and legal process and any
communication with his family was strictly
Earlier in this
period of 7 years, the Police told him that if he confessed that he was a Falun
Gong practitioner and promised not
to practise Falun Gong again he would be
released immediately but he refused to do so. He did not trust the Police and
would be subjected to more severe punishment. During this period he
wrote many letters to the People’s Court, People’s
Procurators and
the Letters and Visiting Bureau but never received a reply. He believed the
letters were confiscated by the Police.
despair and had to commit suicide. He almost died but was saved and was in
hospital for a long time. During this time, his
wife went to Hunan Province with
a lot of money collected from his siblings and relatives to bribe the Police.
[In] July 2007, he
was allowed to return home. However, before his release he
had to sign a confession in relation to his involvement in the Falun Gong
movement and had to promise not to practise Falun Gong in the future.
His name was put
on the ‘blacklist’ with the PSB. He had to report to the local
Police Station regularly and had to be
available for further investigations. He
had to attend political studies on every sensitive day such as National Day and
Office often sent someone to his home.
In order to have
a normal life and permanently escape from persecution by the Chinese
authorities, he had to leave China on a Chinese
passport that was not in his
name. It was impossible for him to get a passport in his own name because his
name was on the PSB “blacklist”.

other passport or travel document and had never travelled
outside his home

relation to his family, he stated that
he has a wife, [children], father, [and
siblings] in China.

name], a Marriage Certificate in [his name and another
name] and a passport in
the name of [Mr A].
applicant was interviewed by the Department [in] April 2008. During the
interview, he re-iterated and expanded on his claims.
applicant’s passport in the name of [Mr A] was examined by the
Department’s Document Examination Unit. In a Report
dated [in] May 2008,
the examiner concluded that the passport in the name of [Mr A] was a genuine
Chinese passport which contains
counterfeit biographical and rear end pages, two
other counterfeit pages and the passport had been re-stitched.
applicant attended a hearing before the Tribunal (differently constituted) on 15
July 2008. During the hearing, he re-iterated
and expanded on his claims.
applicant’s claims in his second application for a Protection visa are
summarised as follows:
He re-iterated
the claims made in his first application for a Protection visa.
He made new
claims as follows. Recently, the PSB has strengthened the crackdown on Falun
Gong practitioners and many practitioners
were arrested again. [In] July 2013,
the Police issued a warrant. [In] July 2013, the Police searched his home. They
took 7,500 RMB.
They detained his wife and took her to a detention centre. The
Police claimed that they had evidence he was a Falun Gong practitioner
tortured his wife and forced her to give evidence to prove that he is a Falun
Gong practitioner. His wife was released
[in] October 2013 and fined 5,000 RMB.
The Police warned his wife, asked her to contact him and ask him to return to
China and report
in person. The Police will go back to check his wife. If he
does not return to China they will arrest her again.

interview he re-iterated and expanded on his claims.

Record dated [in] June 2014.
Applicant’s identity and nationality
records of the Department indicate that the applicant entered Australia [in]
January 2008 on a Chinese passport in the name of

applicant claimed that his real name was [as stated]
and that he came to
Australia [in] January 2008 under a false name using a false passport. He
re-iterated this claim in his second
application for a Protection visa filed
[in] November 2013.

the evidence before it, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the
Tribunal accepts the applicant is who he claims
to be and that he is a national
of China for the purpose of this application. The Tribunal will access his
claims against China.
Tribunal finds that the applicant is a citizen of China and that he is outside
his country of nationality. There is no evidence
before the Tribunal to suggest
that the applicant has a right to enter and reside in any country other than his
country of nationality.

the basis of one of the criteria was enabled to
make a further application for a
Protection visa on the basis of one of the other criteria. Thus an applicant who

applicant gave evidence to the Tribunal on 22 May 2015 in relation to his
claims. He gave evidence that he provided the information
in both his
applications for Protection visas lodged [in] February 2008 and [in] November
2013 respectively. He stated that the information
he provided was true and
correct and he was satisfied that both applications are accurate. He confirmed
that he is not making any
claims in relation to his breach of family planning
laws in China.
Tribunal found the applicant’s evidence to be evasive, contradictory,
implausible and unconvincing. He appeared to have
forgotten some of the claims
he had made previously and gave contradictory evidence. The Tribunal formed the
view that he was fabricating
some of his evidence as he was giving it. The
Tribunal has serious concerns in relation to his credibility and the veracity of
claims for the reasons that follow.
his first application for a Protection visa filed [in] February 2008, the
applicant claimed that in March 2000 he and [Mr B] established
[a] farm in [Town
1] in Hunan Province. He stated that he was the legal representative and [Mr B]
was in charge of the daily operation
of the [farm]. During the hearing on 22 May
2015, he gave evidence that he and [Mr B] established the [farm] in 2001, he
the [farm] and [Mr B] sometimes went to the farm to have a look. He
stated that [Mr B] just practised Falun Gong. These inconsistencies
evidence in relation to when the [farm] was established and who operated the
[farm] raise concerns in relation to the credibility
of the applicant’s
his first application for a Protection visa filed [in] February 2008, the
applicant claimed that [in] February 2001, he, [Mr B]
and other Falun Gong
practitioners were arrested and detained. He claimed that the [farm] was sealed
by the PSB [in] February 2001.
During the hearing on 22 May 2015, he initially
gave evidence that he had no idea what happened to the [farm]. He subsequently
that after his arrest there was no one to operate the factory so it
stopped operating. This inconsistency in the evidence in relation
[farm] ceased operation raises concerns in relation to the credibility of the
applicant’s claims.
his first application for a Protection visa filed [in] February 2008, the
applicant claimed that after his release from detention
he was required to
report to the local Police Station regularly and had to be available for further
investigations. During the hearing
on 22 May 2015, he gave evidence that after
his release from detention he returned to his home [in] Fujian Province. He
stated that
he was required to report once a month to the [PSB]. These
inconsistencies in the evidence in relation to whom and where he was required
report raise concerns in relation to the credibility of the applicant’s
his first application for a Protection visa filed [in] February 2008, the
applicant claimed that his name was put on the ‘blacklist’
PSB. He claimed that it was impossible for him to get a passport in his own name
because his name was on the PSB ‘blacklist’.
He claimed that he had
to leave China on a passport in someone else’s name. During the hearing on
22 May 2015, the Tribunal
asked him about his claim in relation to being on the
‘blacklist’. He appeared to be surprised and did not know what
Tribunal was speaking about. When asked whether his name was on a
‘blacklist’, he responded that he did not know.
He stated that if
the Chinese government put his name of a ‘blacklist’ they did not
tell him. When asked why he claimed
his visa application lodged [in] February
2008 that his name was on a ‘blacklist’, he responded that he
guessed that
it must be on a ‘blacklist’.
applicant’s evidence to the Tribunal on 22 May 2015 that he was unaware if
his name was on a ‘blacklist’ and
he guessed that it might,
contradicts his previous claims that he was unable to obtain a passport in his
own name because his name
was on a ‘blacklist’ and he had to obtain
a passport in someone else’s name to be able to leave China. This
contradiction
in the evidence raises concerns in relation to the credibility of
the applicant’s claims.
applicant provided to the Department a copy of the bio data page of a passport
in his name, [issued] in Fujian Province [in] 2005.
The applicant claims to have
been detained in Hunan Province between [February] 2001 and [July] 2007. The
Tribunal finds it implausible
that he could have applied for a passport in 2005
whilst detained in relation to Falun Gong. The Tribunal finds it even more
implausible
that the Chinese government would have issued a passport in his name
whilst he was in detention in relation to Falun Gong and his
name was on a
‘blacklist’ as claimed in his first application for a Protection
visa filed [in] February 2008.
the hearing on 22 May 2015, the applicant stated that his [brother] applied for
a passport in his name whilst he was detained.
When asked why his [brother]
would apply for a passport in his name rather than his own name, he responded
that he did not know.
He stated that a relative helped his brother to obtain a
passport in his name whilst he was detained. When asked again why his brother
would do that, he responded that his brother did not tell him. The Tribunal
finds this evidence to be implausible. Further, in his
application for a
Protection visa filed [in] November 2013, the applicant did not disclose that he
had a brother. In his application
for a Protection visa filed [in] November
2008, he stated that he had [siblings] but did not disclose that either of them
particular] brother. In his evidence to the Tribunal on 22 May 2015,
he claimed that the information in both applications was true
and correct and he
was satisfied that they were accurate.
the hearing on 22 May 2015, the applicant provided to the Tribunal his current
passport. It was renewed at the Chinese Consulate
in [Australia in] 2014 and is
valid until [2024]. When the Tribunal asked him about the renewal of his
passport, he stated that he
was worried to go inside the Chinese Consulate to
get his passport so he went next door and they said they would help him. He
that he had to pay $800.00 to renew his passport but other people pay
$100.00 or $200.00. The Tribunal finds this evidence to be
implausible. The
Tribunal raised as an issue with the applicant the fact that he claimed in his
first application for a Protection
visa lodged [in] February 2008 that his name
was on a ‘blacklist’ and yet was able to renew his passport in his
[in] 2014. The Tribunal noted that this would tend to indicate that he
was not of adverse interest to the Chinese authorities. He
responded that when
he was released from detention he was issued with a Release Certificate.
applicant’s response does not address the issue raised by the Tribunal.
The Tribunal is of the view that the issue of a
passport in the
applicant’s name [in] 2005 and the issue of a further passport in the
applicant’s name [in] 2014 tends
to indicate that the applicant is not of
adverse interest to the Chinese authorities.
his second application for a Protection visa filed [in] November 2013, the
applicant claimed that the Police issued a warrant [in]
July 2013 and searched
his house [in] July 2013. He claimed that they took 7,500 RMB and detained his
wife at a detention centre.
He claimed that the Police stated that they had
evidence he was a Falun Gong practitioner in Australia. During the hearing on 22
May 2015, the applicant gave evidence that he is not a Falun Gong practitioner
and has never practised Falun Gong in Australia. He
claimed that the police went
to his house in 2013 to look for him because he did not report to them. He gave
evidence that he last
reported to the [PSB] in either October 2008 or December
2008. He previously gave evidence to the Tribunal that he arrived in Australia
[in] January 2008.
the Tribunal asked the applicant whether the Chinese government waited from when
he last reported to them in 2008 until 2013
before they went to his house to
look for him, he responded yes. When the Tribunal stated that it found that hard
to believe, he
responded that they had always been going to his family. When
asked why he had not mentioned that previously, he responded that he
the question and responded he had to report every month. He stated that the
Chinese government cracked down on Falun Gong
in the first half of 2013 and that
is why they went to his house looking for him. He stated that when they went to
his home the police
took between 6,000 and 7,000 RMB.
Tribunal finds it implausible that if the applicant stopped reporting monthly as
required to the local Police Station, or alternatively
to the [PSB], the Chinese
authorities would have waited approximately 5 years until [July] 2013 to go to
the applicant’s home
to look for him. The inconsistency in his evidence in
relation to how much money the Police took from his house also raises concerns
in relation to the credibility of the applicant’s claims.
his second application for a Protection visa filed [in] November 2013, the
applicant claimed that the Police detained his wife
and tortured her to force
her to give evidence to prove that he is a Falun Gong practitioner. He claimed
that his wife was released
[in] October 2013. The Tribunal finds it implausible
that the Police would have tortured the applicant’s wife to obtain
to prove that he is a Falun Gong practitioner when his evidence is that
prior to his release from detention [in] July 2007 he signed
a confession in
relation to his involvement with Falun Gong. During the hearing on 22 May 2015,
the applicant gave evidence that
his wife was arrested [in] July 2013 and
released after about 2 days. The implausibility of this claim and the
inconsistency in relation
to how long his wife was detained raise concerns in
relation to the credibility of the applicant’s claims.
his second application for a Protection visa filed [in] November 2013, the
applicant claimed that if he does not return to China
his wife will be arrested
again. During the hearing on 22 May 2015, the applicant initially gave evidence
that nothing has happened
since he filed his second application for a Protection
visa [in] November 2013. He subsequently gave evidence that the Police make
telephone calls and sometimes go to his house asking about his whereabouts. If
the Chinese government issued the applicant with a
new passport in Sydney [in]
2014 they would be aware that he is in Australia and would not need to telephone
his family or go to
his house to ask about his whereabouts since at least April
2014. These inconsistencies in his evidence raise further concerns in
to the credibility of the applicant’s claims.
Tribunal asked the applicant what he thought would happen to him if he returned
to China. He responded that the Chinese authorities
would control him and he
would not have freedom. When asked if there was anything else he wished to say,
he responded that it would
be great if he had his human rights and freedom and
the Chinese authorities could not control him.
considered all the applicant’s claims and the evidence, the Tribunal is of
the view that the applicant is not a witness
of truth. The Tribunal formed the
view that he had fabricated his claims and was manufacturing some of his
evidence as he was giving
it. The Tribunal formed the view that he was prepared
to say anything to obtain a Protection visa without any regard for the truth.
The Tribunal finds that the applicant is not a credible witness.
Tribunal does not accept that the applicant knew a man named [Mr B] or that he
established and operated [farms] with him. It follows
that the Tribunal does not
accept any of the applicant’s claims that flow from that.
Tribunal does not accept that the applicant’s [brother] applied for a
passport in his name in 2005. The Tribunal does not
accept that the
applicant’s name is, or ever was, on a ‘blacklist’. The
Tribunal does not accept that the Police
issued a warrant [in] July 2013,
6,000 RMB and 7,000
RMB, from his home. The Tribunal does not accept that the
Police detained and tortured his wife and released her [in] October 2013,
alternatively, 2 days later. The Tribunal does not accept that the Police
continue to telephone his family or go to his house
to enquire about his
whereabouts. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is of adverse
interest to the Chinese authorities.
view of the Tribunal’s findings in relation to the applicant’s
credibility, and for the reasons given above, the Tribunal
rejects the entirety
of the applicant’s material claims. The Tribunal is not satisfied that
there is a real risk that the applicant
will suffer significant harm for any of
the reasons put forward by him.
considered all of the applicant’s claims, individually and cumulatively,
the Tribunal is not satisfied, for the reasons
given above, that the applicant
will be arbitrarily deprived of life, the death penalty will be carried out on
him, he will be subjected
to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment or he will
be subjected to degrading treatment or punishment if he returns to China now
in the reasonably foreseeable future.
Accordingly,
the Tribunal is not satisfied that that there are substantial grounds for
believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable
consequence of the applicant
being removed from Australia to China there is a real risk that he will suffer
significant harm as defined.
Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the applicant
does not satisfy the criterion in s.36(2)(aa).
Tribunal finds that the applicant does not satisfy the criterion in s.36(2)(aa).
is no suggestion that the applicant satisfies s.36(2) on the basis of being a
member of the same family unit as a person who
satisfies s.36(2)(a) or
s.36(2)(aa) and who holds a Protection visa. Accordingly, the applicant does not
satisfy the criterion in
Tribunal affirms the decision not to grant the applicant a Protection visa.
