CORAM: THE COURT
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 6 November 2025)
[1] This is an
appeal against the appellant’s conviction by jury, in August 2023, on
three counts of gross indecency with a
person under the age of 14 and one count
of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14. The sole ground of the
invokes the third limb of s 411(1) of the
Criminal Code 1983
Criminal Code”
), namely that there was a miscarriage of
justice, which is argued to have resulted from the failure of the trial Judge to
jury a warning required under
Evidence Act 1939
Evidence Act
”). The appeal involves a question of
law alone and is brought by right pursuant to s 410(a) of the
The mandatory warning
Evidence Act
Where a vulnerable
witness is to give evidence using an arrangement under subsection (2) or (2AB),
the judge must issue a warning
to the jury (if any) to the effect that:
(a) the procedure is a routine practice of the court; and
(b) no adverse inference is to be drawn against the accused as a result of the
use of the arrangement; and
(c) the evidence of the witness is not to be given any greater or lesser weight
because of the use of the arrangement.
well-established that compliance with this section is mandatory and failure to
issue the prescribed warning is an error
[4] There is no
dispute that the trial Judge did not issue any such warning in relation to the
evidence of the two complainants who
were vulnerable witnesses within the
Evidence Act
(alleged victims of a
sexual offence to which the proceedings relate) and who gave evidence in the
case via audio-visual link from
a place outside the courtroom pursuant to
Evidence Act
Miscarriage of justice – material irregularity
[5] The third
limb of s 411(1) of the
Criminal Code
encompasses errors or
irregularities affecting an appellant’s trial which are either
fundamental, in which case there will be
a substantial miscarriage of justice,
and other errors or irregularities.
The appellant did not raise any fundamental error or irregularity in the
[6] For other
errors or irregularities to constitute a miscarriage of justice, they must be
material in the sense that the error or
irregularity could realistically have
affected the reasoning of the jury to a verdict of guilty that was returned by
the jury in
the criminal trial that occurred, where ‘could’ means
‘having the capacity to’ and ‘realistically’
distinguishes assessment of the possibility of a different outcome from a
possibility that is fanciful or
improbable.
This threshold of
materiality is for the appellant to establish, but the burden is not onerous,
and it does not invite an analysis
of whether, but for the error, the accused
might or might not have been found
This assessment is
qualitatively different from the assessment to be made in applying the proviso,
namely whether the evidence properly
admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable
doubt, the accused’s guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its
The issue in
hearing of the appeal, the issues had been refined during the course of the
exchange of written submissions. In particular:
(a) The parties were agreed that the failure to issue the warning required by
Evidence Act
was a procedural irregularity.
(b) The appellant did not contend that the error was of such a category to
constitute a fundamental error such that a substantial
miscarriage of justice
will necessarily be established and there is no need to separately consider the
materiality of the error.
The parties were agreed that, consequently, the
appellant must establish that the error was material in order to constitute a
miscarriage
of justice.
(c) The respondent accepted that if the Court finds that there has been a
miscarriage of justice, the proviso in s 411(2) of the
Criminal Code
should not be applied given the natural limitations of an appeal court seeking
to determine whether the appellant was guilty beyond
reasonable doubt where the
verdicts depend on acceptance of the contested credibility of the
complainants.
(d) The only issue between the parties was whether the appellant had established
that the procedural irregularity was material so
as to constitute a miscarriage
of justice.
[8] So the issue
for this Court to determine is whether the appellant has established that the
failure of the trial Judge to issue
the warning in s 21A(3) could
realistically have affected the reasoning of the jury to a verdict of guilty
that was returned by the
jury in the criminal trial that occurred, that is to
say whether the appellant has shown that the error had the capacity to affect
the reasoning of the jury in such a way that the possibility of a different
outcome was a realistic, as distinct from a fanciful
or improbable
The irregularity was not material
appellant argued that in the absence of such a warning from the trial Judge
there was a risk that the jury might infer that
the complainants were giving
their evidence via audio-visual link from a place outside the courtroom because
they were afraid of
the appellant and, moreover, that they needed protecting
from him. It was argued that in a case such as the present, which depended
heavily on the jury’s assessment of the credibility of the complainants,
this may have affected the jury’s assessment
of their credit in a manner
prejudicial to the appellant.
[10] For the
reasons that follow, there was no realistic possibility that the failure to
issue the prescribed warning was material
in the relevant sense, and there was
no realistic possibility that the giving of such a warning by the trial Judge
could have resulted
in a different verdict on any of the four counts.
offending had allegedly occurred when the complainants were eight or nine years
old. At the time of giving evidence, the
complainants were 33 and 34 years of
age and had had little or no contact with the appellant in the intervening
years. Given the
historical nature of the allegations, with the complainants
well into their adulthood at the time of giving their evidence, the jury
unlikely to have the impression that the complainants were giving their evidence
by audio-visual link because they needed to
be protected from the
[12] Nothing was
said by the prosecutor, defence counsel, or the trial Judge that could have
given the impression to the jury that
the medium by which the complainants gave
their evidence was anything other than regular. Indeed, submissions were made by
the prosecutor,
and instructions were given by the trial Judge which must have
conveyed the impression to the jury that the giving of evidence by
audio-visual link was entirely orthodox.
[13] In his
opening address, when telling the jury about the evidence that would be put
before them in the trial, the prosecutor said:
In this case, you
will see some diagrams, and you will hear some oral evidence. And when I say
oral evidence, you will see some people
come in person to give evidence in that
witness box.
And you will also see some people up on the screen by
what’s called AVL or audio-visual link. This is simply a matter of
convenience,
a standard method of
giving evidence in a criminal trial.
And in addition to those documents and diagrams that I referred to. You will
also see a recorded statutory declaration of [SC] played.
So, she is one of the
two complainants.
She gave part of her evidence by way of an interview with
the police. And again, this is a very normal thing in a criminal tria1.
Now in this trial, the direct evidence about the sexual offending comes from
[TC] and [SC] themselves. As I said, [SC] has given part
of her evidence in that
police video statement.
And she will give evidence via audio-visual link in a
remote witness room. Again, it’s an ordinary method of giving evidence.
And [TC] hasn’t participated in an interview, so all of her evidence
will be given via AVL. And of course, both complainants
will be cross-examined
appellant contended that opening remarks by the prosecutor are no substitute for
a warning given with the imprimatur of the
trial Judge. So much may be accepted.
That is why the failure to give the warning by the trial Judge constituted a
procedural irregularity.
Even so, the submissions of the parties to the jury are
relevant to an assessment of the likely impression made upon the jury of
complainants giving their evidence in the manner that they did.
[15] Three other
civilian witnesses also gave evidence by way of audio-visual link.
Consequently, the jury was highly unlikely to
infer that the complainants gave
their evidence by audio-visual link because they needed to be protected from the
appellant. This
was entirely consistent with the prosecutor’s comments
that giving evidence in that manner is
“ordinary method of giving evidence” and a “very normal thing
in a criminal trial”.
[16] At the time
of giving their evidence, the complainants lived together in Tennant Creek, some
500 kilometres from Alice Springs
where the trial was conducted, and this was
made known to the jury. Again, this would have reinforced the natural inference,
the prosecutor’s opening remarks, that the complainants were
giving their evidence via audio-visual link due to their remoteness,
the other civilian witnesses who gave evidence by that means.
[17] After those
three witnesses gave evidence and there were some technical difficulties, the
trial Judge said to the jury:
Thank you, members of the jury, for
your patience today. Sometimes the technology can be irritating, but just bear
in mind that by
having audio-visual links, we save thousands of dollars in
airfares and accommodation and so on. So in spite of the technical difficulties
from time to time. It’s still very, very useful for court
proceedings.
so try and understand that things
don’t always go as one would
[18] Shortly
before the jury were played the recorded statutory declaration of one of the
complainants, the trial Judge directed the
jury as follows (emphasis
... You should still take the time to observe the
witness’ behaviour or demeanour, her body language, her reactions, the
taken to respond to questions, and, indeed, even the tone and volume of her
all of the same things that you would take notice of if the
witness were actually sitting in at court.
specific remarks to the jury by the trial Judge effectively mitigated any risk
that the jury would treat the evidence given
by the complainants any differently
because it was given by audio-visual link.
[20] The failure
of Defence counsel to raise the absence of the warning with the trial Judge at
any stage tends against a finding
that there was a perceptible risk of the
miscarriage of justice. As the Court observed in
De Silva v The
failure of counsel to seek a direction is not determinative against successful
challenge in a case in which the direction
was required to avoid a perceptible
risk of the miscarriage of justice. The absence of an application for a
direction may, however,
tend against finding that that risk was present.
[21] Various
decisions of the intermediate courts of appeal in other jurisdictions have
concluded that the failure to give a similar
direction prescribed and mandated
by statute constitutes an error of law and a miscarriage of
Correctly, in our view,
the appellant did not press reliance upon those decisions, essentially because
all of those decisions were
delivered prior to the decision of the High Court in
and they did not expressly address the test of materiality laid
down by the High Court in that case. Of itself, that is a basis
upon which to
distinguish them. Nor, in our view, did the decisions implicitly consider
whether the failure was material in the
sense that the error or irregularity
could realistically have affected the reasoning of the jury to a verdict of
guilty that was
returned by the jury in the criminal trial that
In effect, those
decisions held that the error of law in not giving a mandated direction was,
, a miscarriage of justice. Consequently, the decisions
provide no assistance in the determination of the only issue in this
substance of the mandatory warning under
is that: (a) the procedure of a witness giving evidence from a location
outside of the courtroom via audio-visual link is a routine
practice of the
court; (b) no adverse inference should be drawn against the accused as a result
of the use of that arrangement; and
(c) the evidence of the witness is not to be
given any greater or lesser weight because of its use.
[23] Because
other witnesses gave evidence by audio-visual link as the complainants had done,
the complainants were adults and the
alleged offending occurred many years
previously, and because of what was said by the Crown prosecutor and the trial
Judge during
the trial (as set out above), there is no realistic possibility
that the jury could have: (a) considered that the way the complainants’
evidence was given was anything other than a routine practice of the Court; (b)
drawn an adverse inference against the appellant
as a result of the
complainants’ evidence being given by this means; or (c) given the
complainants’ evidence any greater
or lesser weight because of the use of
the arrangement.
appellant argued that the remarks by the trial Judge about the purpose of using
audio-visual technology to take evidence
would have suggested to the jury only
reason for the complainants to give evidence by that
means may have been to save cost and inconvenience. The appellant identified
complainants’ evidence as central to the issues in the trial, as compared
with the other witnesses whose evidence was more
peripheral. The appellant
argued that the jury would have an expectation that the complainants would give
their evidence in person,
and would thereby assume that there was some reason
other than that identified by the trial Judge as the purpose for such evidence.
complainants were supported by a witness assistance officer when giving
evidence, as is permitted by
s 21A(2D)(a)
Evidence Act
other witnesses who gave evidence by audio-visual link did not have support of
that nature. The appellant argued that that
distinction between the
complainants and those other witnesses would have suggested to the jury that
there was something different
the complainants and would have given rise to the risk of prejudicial reasoning.
presence of a support person for the complainants’ evidence does not alter
our assessment. In essence, the appellant
argued that the presence of a support
person sitting next to each complainant as they gave their evidence served to
distinguish the
manner in which the complainants gave their evidence from the
manner in which the other witnesses gave evidence by audio-visual link.
difficulty with the submission is that the presence of the support person had
nothing to do with the complainants giving their
evidence via audio-visual link
rather than in the court room directly. If they had done so, they would have
been entitled to have
a support person present. As the respondent submitted,
the presence of a support person as the complainants gave their evidence
entirely neutral in the present context.
Queen v Hellwig
and Mullins JJ (McPherson JA agreeing) referred to the other decisions cited
above and held (at [21]-[22]) that the playing
of pre-recorded evidence or
giving evidence via audio-visual link was a ‘marked departure’ from
the conventional manner
in which evidence is given before a jury and the
difference ‘is likely to surprise jurors’ who have some knowledge of
ordinary court proceedings. Without the benefit of the directions, that
surprise ‘may well turn into conjecture adverse to
an accused’ and
the directions are intended to dispel the surprise and to prevent the
conjecture. Furthermore, (at [23]) excluding
an accused from the complainant
child’s presence is likely to give rise to speculation that the measure
has been undertaken
because of some particular characteristic of the accused
which is likely to be associated with his guilt. Their Honours held (at
that it is essential that that speculation be quashed.
noteworthy that this case focused on the change to the practice of receiving
evidence and the surprise to which that may
give rise, with the direction being
necessary to dispel that surprise and the conjecture which would flow from it.
That case was
heard almost 20 years ago when the manner of giving evidence was
new and unusual. Today, particularly after the period of the Covid-19
electronic audio-visual communications are a day-to-day feature of the lives of
ordinary people and, consistently with
that, it is far more common and usual for
witnesses to give evidence via audio-visual link to the Court. We do not
consider there
to be any realistic possibility that any member of a jury would
be, to any significant extent, surprised by the fact that any witness,
a complainant, gave evidence by way of an audio-visual link.
[29] There is no
realistic possibility that the explanation of the trial Judge for the use of the
technology would not have been accepted
by the jury as
explanation
for doing so which excluded all other reasons for doing so, rather than
explanation which left open that there were other reasons for doing
so, particularly, a reason which would permit them to draw an
adverse inference
against the appellant. Given that the complainants were adults and the alleged
offending occurred many years previously
with no suggestion of contact since
that time, and there was evidence that the complainants lived in Tennant Creek,
a long way from
Alice Springs where the trial was
there was nothing to
suggest to the jury that the explanation given by the trial Judge was not
reason why they gave their evidence in the way that they did. There
was nothing said during the trial to suggest that the complainants
evidence in the way they did because they were vulnerable or had some justified
fear of the appellant.
[30] The above
conclusions are not borne of an assumption that there was no need for the
direction in this particular
They are founded on what
actually occurred in the trial considered as a whole.
Disposition

is dismissed.
