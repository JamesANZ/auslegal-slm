EX TEMPORE REVISED JUDGMENT
this point in the hearing counsel for the plaintiff wishes to read or tender
affidavits by the plaintiff which go to issues of
exposure to dust and which
also go to issues of quantum of damages. Mr Talintyre has objected to the
plaintiff's evidence in chief
being given by means of affidavit, pointing to r
31.1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules and taking me to a decision of
Pembroke J in Thomas v SMP (International) Pty Ltd
[2010] NSWSC 822.
Pembroke J spoke of the limitations of affidavit evidence, particularly where
there are issues of fact involving oral representations
and conversations. I
take it that his Honour was hearing a commercial type of case. Of course, there
could be very valid reasons
why other issues should not be covered by affidavit
but should be covered by oral evidence only.
this Tribunal, since 1989, when it was established, a practice has grown up of
allowing a plaintiff to give evidence in chief by
way of affidavit. That
practice has largely come about in cases involving asbestos-related diseases and
in cases particularly where
a sufferer from such a disease is terminally ill, or
of advanced years, or both. In this case we have a plaintiff who is relatively
young but a plaintiff who has significant emotional and psychiatric issues, at
least so far as I can discern from the opening of
my view, it would be an unfair burden on this plaintiff to require him to give
oral evidence of his work at the various mines and
his exposure at the various
mines when, as I understand the plaintiff's case, he is a person who is, can I
say, fragile psychiatrically.
I am of the view that if I allow the plaintiff's
evidence to be given by affidavit, given the detail in the two affidavits, which
I have pre-read, and given the opportunity which each defendant has had to take
instructions on the detailed matters covered by the
two affidavits, I would not
be doing any injustice to a defendant, and that each defendant would be able to
appropriately cross examine
upon the evidence in chief contained in the
affidavits. I propose to follow the usual and almost invariable practice in this
of allowing a plaintiff who is unwell to give evidence in chief by
affidavit. I therefore reject the submission by Mr Talintyre that
require the plaintiff to give his evidence in chief orally.
will then deal with each affidavit in turn and see if there are any objections
to the affidavits. I will say as part of this judgment
that I have indicated to
Mr Talintyre that he is free to renew this objection to evidence in chief being
given by affidavit in relation
to the three lay witnesses. In relation to those
three witnesses, I can see, at present, no real reason why they could not give
evidence orally rather than by affidavit. They, so far as I am aware, are
not unwell, and could give evidence orally in the usual
fashion. That is simply
a preliminary view; I say I have not read their affidavits yet and I will hear
submissions in due course
