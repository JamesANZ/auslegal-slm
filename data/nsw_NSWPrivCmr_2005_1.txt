Use of personal information for advertising material [2005] NSWPrivCmr 1 (1 January 2005)
Use of personal information for advertising material
Mr H applied to a private college for employment as a teacher. Among
other credentials, he provided to the college his resume, which
included his
overseas study and teaching experience. Mr H was accepted and was told that the
college’s advertising material
for his future classes would contain his
brief profile. He did not object to that.
Some time later, according to
Mr H, he came across advertising material for his classes distributed in public
places in order to attract
students. To his dismay the advertisements contained
all the details of his studying and teaching experience taken from his resume.
Mr H was quite upset and regarded this as a breach of his privacy.
complaints to the college management were met with scepticism. He demanded the
brochures be withdrawn from circulation but this
was refused. He then complained
to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (Cth), however his complaint was
declined because the information
disclosed was deemed to be part of his employee
record. Employee records are exempt from the operation of the Federal
(the PPIP Act). Part 4 of the PPIP Act gives the Privacy Commissioner powers to
investigate and conciliate privacy related complaints.
to the college raising concerns about Mr H’s circumstances and questioning
their practices. The college replied
outlining their version of events.
According to the college, Mr H was shown the advertising material prior to it
being distributed
and had verbally approved the context. When he initially
complained, he was told that it was not possible to withdraw the material
immediately but it would be revised, when re-printed.
Mr H emphatically
denied that his consent was obtained prior to the material being distributed and
regarded the college’s actions
at the time as not being sufficient to
remedy the damage caused to him.
At one stage Mr H engaged legal
representation to defend himself and later the college retained the services of
a solicitor. It was
quite clear to Privacy NSW that the parties were unwilling
to change their respective positions and that any further attempt to conciliate
the matter would not be successful.
The positive outcome, however, was a
change of practice by the college, whereby written consent is now requested from
all teaching
staff prior to the distribution of any advertising material. In the
end, the Commissioner decided to take no further action on the
matter based on
his view that it was resolved to his satisfaction.
This case study
represents a good example of the difficulties the Commissioner faces when
parties are unwilling to conciliate. This
is even more of a problem when it is
hard to establish what actually happened in the absence of hard evidence and
when both parties
continue to defend their conflicting versions of
