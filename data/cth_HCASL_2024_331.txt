applicant seeks an extension of time within which to apply for special leave to
appeal from the whole of the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of the Supreme
Court of New South Wales (Bell CJ, Meagher JA and Harrison CJ at CL).
the issue of interpretation raised in this application is of public importance,
there is no reason to doubt the reasoning
of the Court of Appeal. It follows
that this application does not have sufficient prospects of success to warrant a
grant of special
leave and it would therefore be futile to grant an extension of
leave to appeal is refused with costs.
