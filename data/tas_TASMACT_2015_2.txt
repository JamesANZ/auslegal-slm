INTRODUCTION
1 Mr Troy Lee Dolbey died as a result of a motor vehicle
accident on 5 February 2012. Following this a number of claims for benefits
were made, or notice of an intention to make such a claim was given indicating
multiple persons might seek an award of death benefits
as a result of asserted
dependency upon Mr Dolbey. After an extensive period of time and also following
factual investigation conducted
at the request of the applicant the claims
before the Board are:
(a) Application brought by Julie Dolbey on behalf of her son,
Jayden Lee Dolbey, born 26 July 2000.
(b) Application brought by Shelly
Winter on behalf of her daughter Nikiesha Skye Dolbey born 3 March
(c) Application for scheduled benefits signed by Racheal Kay
(d) Letter outlining details of a claim for benefits from Nicole
Louise Weldon on her behalf and also on behalf of her son, Shaun
2 There was a dispute between the detailed claimants as to
entitlement with challenges concerning dependency. Following a number
directions hearings this matter was set for hearing before the Tribunal. All of
the claimants were not legally represented and
were provided with detailed
information from the Tribunal as to their obligations concerning the
establishment of an entitlement
in respect of the claims each had made and also
challenging claims made by any of the other respondents. When this matter came
hearing there was no appearance by or on behalf of any of the respondents
and given the delays to date and the detailed information
provided to the
respondents the matter proceeded ex parte in order that those claims that had
been established could be finalised.
DETERMINATION
3 The Tribunal heard submissions on behalf of the Board and
also noted the information that had been gathered in an endeavour to allow
Board to conclude as to appropriate entitlement of each of the respondents. I
was satisfied, having regard to that material,
that both Jayden Lee Dolbey and
Nikiesha Skye Dolbey were dependents of Mr Dolbey as at the date of his death.
In particular a birth
certificate evidences that Mr Dolbey was the father of
Nikiesha and there is also documentary evidence showing the obligation upon
Dolbey to pay child support for both Nikiesha and Jayden Dolbey.
4 Insofar as
the application for scheduled benefits signed by Racheal Barker, this contains
no detail in the form itself and has apparently
there has been no further action
taken by Ms Barker to prosecute any claim that she might believe existed. There
is no basis upon
the material before the Tribunal to determine any entitlement
for Racheal Kay Barker.
5 A letter setting out details of a claim was
received from Nicole Louise Weldon on 17 April 2013. This letter asserts a
on behalf of Ms Weldon and also her son, Shaun Jacob Smith. Ms
Weldon asserts that she was in a relationship with Mr Dolbey in the
preceding his death and that her son, Shaun Smith, was residing with them and
was dependent upon both adults. Ms Weldon has
not made an application in the
prescribed from nor has she provided detail requested by the applicant to
support her assertion as
to the nature of the relationship between her and Mr
Dolbey. The only evidence provided was some correspondence addressed to Mr
Dolbey at an address that Ms Weldon asserts was the residence of her mother and
that she and Mr Dolbey resided at that residence
together. I accept the
submission made on behalf of the applicant that this material does not establish
that the parties were in
a relationship, it merely indicates a postal address
that may have been used at one time by Mr Dolbey. I was satisfied based upon
submissions made on behalf of the applicant and also in the absence of evidence
substantiating the necessary personal relationship
that I cannot be satisfied
that Ms Weldon and Ms Dolbey were in a significant relationship in the period
before his death nor that
she was accordingly dependent in any degree upon him.
Given this finding it follows that I cannot be satisfied that Ms Weldon’s
son, Shaun Smith, was dependent upon Mr Dolbey.
6 The factual material before
the Tribunal at this time is not detailed, but this is due to the failure of the
respondents to pursue
any claim which they believed they may have had and in the
manner that has been explained to them both by the applicant and the Tribunal.
The Tribunal therefore makes its determination as to the statutory entitlements
based upon there being only two dependents of Mr
Dolbey established to the
Tribunal’s satisfaction at this time.
7 Applying the calculation
provided by
Regulation 1
Motor Accidents (Liabilities and
Compensation) Regulations 2010
there shall be an order that there be a payment
of $53,750.00 to the Public Trustee as provided by s25 of the Act on behalf of
Skye Dolbey and a further order that there shall be a payment of
$44,375.00 to the Public Trustee as provided by s25 of the Act on
Jayden Lee Dolbey.
