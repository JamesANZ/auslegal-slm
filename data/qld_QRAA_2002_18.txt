29 September 2002
Mr Darryl Griffiths, Chairman of Stewards, North Queensland Racing
Association
APPEAL FROM:
A decision of the North Queensland Racing Association Appeals Committee
involving Jockey, Michael Cullen
APPEARANCES:
Griffiths, Darryl v North Queensland Racing Association Appeals Committee
[2002] QRAA 18
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr L Williams AO – Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen – Deputy Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield
This is an appeal by the Stewards from a decision of the North Queensland
Racing Association Appeals Committee. The NQRA Appeals Committee
had reduced a
fine imposed by the Stewards on jockey, Michael Cullen, from $500 to $100.
Cullen was charged with and convicted of a breach of AR. 137 which
“AR.137 Any rider may be punished if, in the opinion of the
(a) He is guilty of careless, improper, incompetent, or foul
The specification against Cullen was that he was guilty of improper riding in
that he struck another jockey, D. Bradbery, with his
whip near the winning post
in a race in Townsville.
The video disclosed that Cullen had changed his action with the whip and
appeared to make one stroke at Bradbery who was tightening
on his mount during
the finishing stages of the race.
The Stewards convicted Cullen and the Appeals Committee upheld the
conviction. The only issue is what is the proper penalty. The Appeals
considered the matter in some detail and reduced the penalty from $500 to
The NQRA Appeals Committee carefully distinguished penalties for other
similar offences and their response was sound.
Having read the transcript and viewed the video of the incident this
Authority takes the view that while the penalty decided on by
the Appeals
Committee is low it is not such as requires the Authority to interfere with the
decision of the NQRA Appeals Committee.
The appeal is dismissed.
