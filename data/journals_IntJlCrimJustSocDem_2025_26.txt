Introduction
Criminology
content addresses sensitive topics associated with offending, victimisation, and
criminal justice processes. This means
tertiary educators are exposed to the
probability of student disclosures of crime, harm, and violence in direct and
indirect ways
(Branch et al., 2011). There has been little empirical research
examining the rate of student disclosures of crime, violence, and
trauma (see
Branch et al., 2011). However, some criminologists, such as Keene and Jordan
(2021, p. 67), have recounted anecdotes
disclosures in their classes:
Student disclosures of trauma have been common in our experience, as others
teaching similar content have also observed. ... Students
feeling able to make
disclosures of trauma to their teachers requires a high level of rapport and
trust to have been built between
the student and teaching staff. Disclosures of
this nature are unlikely if students do not feel such safeguards exist.
In recent years, there has been a strong focus on the prevalence of student
experiences of sexual violence and harassment, including
on university campuses
in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, and the failure of universities to
respond (see Australian Human Rights
Commission, 2017; Beres et al., 2020;
Funnell, 2016; Heywood et al., 2022). More broadly, there has been a strong
focus at a federal
and state level. This has included key commissions of inquiry
and national action plans to address gender-based violence in Australia
Aotearoa New Zealand (see
National plan to end violence against women and
children 2022–2032
(Department of Social Services [DSS], 2022);
Aorerekura: The national strategy to eliminate family violence and sexual
violence 2021–2046
(New Zealand Government, 2021)). The increased
emphasis on these harms in social, political, and legal discourse might, in
also influenced the increase in student disclosures to criminology
educators in recent years, particularly since the emergence of
the digital
hashtag #MeToo in 2017.
Branch et al. (2011) found educators teaching in disciplines centring on
violence-related subjects may be more likely to receive student
disclosures of
crime, violence, and trauma, compared to educators in other disciplines.
However, there remains a paucity of research
examining the extent to which
criminologists specifically receive student disclosures of crime, violence, and
trauma. To address
this gap, our study draws on a survey of 176 ongoing,
contract, and sessional educators
across Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. The research explores the prevalence
and predictors of student disclosures of crime, violence,
and trauma at
universities in these countries. Findings show 66.9% of the educators reported
at least one experience of a student
disclosure of crime, violence, or trauma in
the preceding two years (from May 2021–May 2023). On average, study
participants
reported three to four instances of student disclosures. These
disclosures involved robbery, assault, terrorism, and witnessing or
affiliated with people who have been involved in homicides. Notably, the most
common harms students disclosed to criminology
educators were sexual violence
and domestic and family/whānau
The high number of disclosures of gender-based violence identified in our
study indicate a crucial need to bolster the type, and level
of, training and
support offered to criminology educators who have, or are likely to, receive
student disclosures. This would improve
referral pathways and targeted
interventions for students, and help ensure educators’ emotional and
psychological well-being.
These measures could create safer and more supportive
learning environments for students and criminology educators. Gender was not
found to be a significant predictor of the number of disclosures educators
received (cf. Richards et al., 2013). The likelihood of
educators receiving a
higher number of student disclosures increased if they shared support services
on learning management portals;
utilised content or trigger warnings in
lectures, tutorials, and other classes; and/or taught subjects related to
domestic and family/whānau
violence and sexual violence. Below, we provide
an overview of findings from the existing literature relating to student
disclosures
of crime, violence, and trauma. We then present our research design,
method, and key findings.
Understanding Student Disclosures of Crime, Violence, and Trauma to
University Educators
University students have been extensively studied for their views on the
prevalence of, fears about, and experiences of crime, violence,
and trauma. A
United Kingdom (UK) study found university students perceived crime as an
underlying feature of undergraduate life
(Selwyn, 2009). Additionally,
Grinshteyn et al. (2020) noted minority students had a higher level of fear of
crime than their peers.
Student perceptions have also been sought regarding
fears about credit and debit card fraud (Abdulai, 2020), the motivations driving
hate crimes (Andersson et al., 2018), and deliberate drugging (Butler et al.,
Although university students may be victim-survivors of diverse crime types,
research investigating the prevalence of crime, violence,
and trauma amongst
this cohort has heavily focused on gender-based violence. For example, Fedina et
al. (2020) found 17.4% of students
reported experiencing stalking while at
college in the United States (US). This research showed cisgender women,
transgender/gender-nonconforming,
and sexual minority students were more likely
to be victim-survivors of stalking than cisgender men. While studies have found
transgender
people more likely to be victim-survivors of sexual assault than
cisgender men and women, Coulter et al. (2017) documented a higher
likelihood of
sexual assault for cisgender women than cisgender men. Notably, university
students with disabilities were approximately
twice as likely to experience
intimate partner violence (IPV) than their counterparts without disabilities. In
this respect, students
with mental illness and multiple disability types were
found to have the greatest likelihood of experiencing IPV (Scherer et al.,
2016). In Germany, a study examining sexual aggression perpetration at four
universities found a prevalence rate of 62.1% for women
and 37.5% for men
(Kráhe et al., 2021). Another Canadian study of 977 university students
found 23.2% of women, 9.6% of men,
and 16.7% of non-binary students reported
experiencing sexual violence at least once in the preceding 12 months (Jeffrey
2023). A UK study by Hales and Gannon (2022) also found one in nine of
the 554 male university students surveyed self-reported recent
aggression.
Australian research has shown university students have experienced
gender-based violence at alarming rates. A study by Zark et al.
(2022) found
women tertiary students in Australia reported prevalence estimates of 56% for
physical violence, 53% for sexual violence,
81% for psychological violence, and
48% for financial violence by an intimate partner or family member since the age
of 18 years.
In Aotearoa New Zealand, a report was released in 2017 by the
collective,
Thursdays in Black
, about sexual harassment and assault on
university campuses. The report revealed 52% of cis-gender heterosexual women,
53% of cis-gender
lesbian women, and 63% of bi-sexual cis-gender women reported
experiencing sexual assault while undertaking their degrees. Fifty-seven
cent of Māori women and 77% of takatāpui (LGBTQ+) gender-identifying
Māori students disclosed being subjected
to sexual assault during their
time at university (Thursdays in Black, 2017). The study found a further 90% of
students with disabilities
experienced sexual harassment during their time in
tertiary education in Aotearoa New Zealand.
In broad terms, disclosure involves sharing one’s experience of crime,
violence, and/or trauma with another person (see Mennicke
et al., 2022).
However, this does not necessarily mean students want to seek help for their
experience or make a formal report to
their university or the police (Zark et
al., 2022). International examples found students were more likely to disclose
experiences
of crime, violence, and trauma to their roommates and friends rather
than reporting to law enforcement (Arney, 2020). Students have
also expressed a
lack of trust in their university to position their needs and interests at the
forefront (Marques et al., 2020).
The rate of student disclosures to university
educators has been less extensively researched. Similarly, few studies have
investigated
the factors shaping the rate at which—and reasons
why—students disclose crime, violence, and trauma to their educators.
To our knowledge, only one empirical study in the US has examined the rate at
which university educators receive student disclosures
of victimisation
(Richards et al., 2013). Richards and colleagues (2013) randomly sampled 261
professors at two US colleges to examine
whether student disclosures of crime,
violence, and trauma were a common occurrence for college professors. The
research also examined
whether staff characteristics—namely, gender and
the nature of the topics they teach—predict higher levels of student
disclosures. The authors hypothesised that female university educators who
taught on sensitive topics would be more likely to receive
at least one
disclosure of crime, violence, or trauma, compared to men or those who did not
teach sensitive topics. Richards and
colleagues (2013) attributed this
hypothesis to expectations about women’s teaching styles, often influenced
by gendered assumptions
assumed to be more compassionate and emotionally available to students (see Bem,
1983). Their research was also influenced by Lindholm et al.’s (2005)
national survey of college teachers. The study found
approximately 46% of women
university educators reported actively attempting to assist in the emotional
development of their students,
compared to 33% of men university educators.
The disparity between men and women educators receiving disclosures of crime,
violence, and trauma may also reflect the different
and uneven emotional and
invisible labour performed by women in academia to support students. Minoritised
women and trans and gender-diverse
academics have been shown to perform even
higher levels of such labour (Rickett & Morris, 2020; Wallace et al., 2017).
disparities have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (Górska
et al., 2021). Branch et al. (2011) further noted that
an educator’s
gender may shape the nature of the subjects they teach, which, in turn, may lead
to disclosures of crime, violence,
and trauma. Women in higher education are
more likely to teach liberal arts subjects, including women’s studies,
that concern
topics such as domestic and family/whānau and sexual violence.
As Hayes-Smith et al. (2010, p. 56) stated, “professors,
especially in
fields like criminal justice and sociology, teaching classes on family violence,
may be viewed as especially attractive
support systems for students because of
their expertise and/or their perceived proclivity for withholding
judgement”. Branch
et al. (2011) found educators in disciplines with
violence-related subjects—including criminology and criminal
justice—may
be more likely to encounter student disclosures related to
crime, violence, and trauma than educators in other disciplines.
Richards et al. (2013) found 42% of their study participants reported
receiving a student disclosure of crime, violence, or trauma
over their teaching
career. The research also revealed 29% of those individuals who received student
disclosures taught courses on
crime, victims, and/or gender/sexuality. The most
disclosed incidents included rape and sexual assault (42%), assault (18%), theft
(15%), domestic violence (6%), and sexual harassment and stalking (both 3%).
Richards et al.’s logistic regression identified
two statistically
significant predictors of educators receiving a disclosure of crime, violence,
or trauma. Professors who taught
sensitive topics were 2.63 times more likely to
receive student disclosures than those who did not cover such subjects. This
the nature of the material being taught can influence students'
decisions to disclose their experiences to their educators. Furthermore,
study found a correlation between professors’ age and the likelihood of
receiving student disclosures. As professors’
age increased, the odds of
receiving a student disclosure decreased by a factor of 0.97. This suggests
younger educators may be more
likely to receive disclosures, compared to their
older counterparts. However, Richards et al.’s (2013) study did not find
significant
associations between professors’ gender and receiving student
disclosures.
The Current Study
As Richards et al.’s important study was conducted over 10 years ago,
there is a need for further research to provide a more
contemporary
understanding of student disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma to
university educators. To our knowledge, no study
to date has explored the extent
to which criminology educators receive such disclosures. Richards et al.’s
(2013) study examined
whether gender predicted educators receiving at least one
student disclosure of crime, violence, or trauma. However, no study has
whether gender predicts higher student disclosures while also controlling for
demographic, pedagogical views, teaching strategies,
and subject matter
variables. This research is important given recent evidence suggesting women
educators receive notably high numbers
of student disclosures (Bedera, 2021;
Growette Bostaph et al., 2021; Keene & Jordan, 2021).
It is also beneficial to consider factors shaping the likelihood of student
disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma alongside what
is taught and how it
is taught. University educators have developed a range of techniques promoting a
violence- and trauma-informed,
and survivor-centred pedagogy. These measures
create learning environments that prioritise the needs and experiences of
victim-survivors.
Specific techniques can create spaces where victim-survivors
feel safe, validated, and understood, acknowledging the impact of trauma
their lives. These include encouraging students to express their additional
thoughts or concerns via email (Bedera, 2021), sharing
support services in
lectures and tutorials (Keene & Jordan, 2021), and considering the intensity
of the material an educator
intends to cover in their teaching (see Harding,
2022; Zurbriggen, 2011). The selection and use of these strategies can be
patterned by course subject matter. As these techniques seek to foster
an environment of psychological safety, their use may mediate
the number of
disclosures students make to educators. However, relatively little research has
empirically verified whether educators
using particular strategies to teach
sensitive topics are more likely to receive disclosures.
This study focused on the following research questions to address these
hitherto under-researched factors that may shape how students
experiences of crime, violence, and trauma to staff. Questions 1 and 2 are
adapted from Richards et al.’s (2013) exploratory
student-to-professor disclosures of crime victimisation. To our knowledge, this
represents the only other study that has
quantitatively examined the rate and
predictors of student-to-educator disclosures in higher education.
Research Question 1
Are student disclosures of crime,
violence, and trauma common for criminology educators at universities in
Australia and Aotearoa
New Zealand?
● Hypothesis 1: Student disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma are
a very common occurrence for criminology educators at
universities in Australia
and Aotearoa New Zealand.
Research Question 2
Do educators’ gender; age;
ethnicity; sharing of support services on unit learning management systems; use
of content or trigger
warnings in lectures, tutorials, and other classes; and
teaching of subjects discussing domestic and family/whānau violence
sexual violence predict the number of student disclosures of crime, violence,
and trauma they receive?
● Hypothesis 2: Educators who are women, non-binary, genderqueer/fluid
or use another term will receive significantly more student
disclosures of
crime, violence, and trauma, compared with educators who are men.
● Hypothesis 3: Educators who teach subjects discussing domestic and
family/whānau violence and/or sexual violence will
receive significantly
more student disclosures than educators who do not teach subjects discussing
domestic and family/whānau
violence and sexual violence.
Research Question 3
Do educators’ gender; age;
ethnicity; sharing of support services on unit learning management systems; or
use of content or
trigger warnings in lectures, tutorials, and other classes
predict the types of student disclosures educators receive?
● Hypothesis 4: Educators who are men will be significantly less likely
to receive at least one disclosure of sexual violence
and significantly less
likely to receive at least one disclosure of intimate partner violence, compared
with educators who are women,
non-binary or another gender.
Study Design
Sampling Method and Recruitment
To address our research questions, we employed an online survey
questionnaire. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Deakin
University’s Human Research Ethics Committee (DUHREC, project number
2022-293). To generate a potentially representative sample,
we created a
sampling frame using contact details obtained from university websites. We
compiled a list of all universities in Australia
and Aotearoa New Zealand with
criminology and/or criminal justice programs using official government lists and
information on individual
university websites. Thirty-six criminology and/or
criminal justice programs were identified (
= 30 Australia,
Aotearoa New Zealand). These included criminology, criminal justice, legal
studies, or justice undergraduate degrees, or generalist
degrees (e.g., Bachelor
of Arts or Social Sciences) where criminology, criminal justice, or justice
majors and minors were offered.
Subsequently, we collected contact and
demographic information for ongoing and contracted university educators teaching
programs. We emailed the survey to 588 ongoing, contract, and sessional
academics that we identified as teaching criminology and/or
criminal justice
programs in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. We also advertised the survey on
our professional social media accounts,
such as LinkedIn. To mitigate potential
biases associated with self-selection, the advertisements for participant
recruitment deliberately
avoided mentioning the study’s focus on student
disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma, as the study encompassed various
aspects of criminologists’ teaching and learning activities. Data
collection took place between May and June 2023.
Survey Instrument
Our survey comprised four thematic areas, relating to: 1) participants’
recent teaching load, teaching practices, and their
universities’ teaching
practices; 2) participants’ teaching practices, curriculum, and the extent
to which work-integrated
learning, sensitive subjects, and Indigenous knowledges
were embedded in their teaching; 3) the challenges associated with teaching
criminology; and 4) demographic information, including age, gender, academic
role, and career stage. Several survey items were adapted
from the Higher
Education Research Institute's 2016–2017 faculty survey (Stolzenberg et
al., 2019) and Jaggars et al.’s
(2020) COVID-19 teaching and learning
survey. This paper focuses solely on data related to student disclosures of
crime, violence,
and trauma.
Our sample consisted of 176 criminology educators teaching at one or more
universities in Australia or Aotearoa New Zealand (see Table
1). This included
76 sessional educators and 100 ongoing or contracted academics. The response
rate of 30% aligns with expectations
for a list-based email survey on a salient
topic (Callegaro et al., 2015, p. 137). A survey completeness benchmark of 60%
resulting in 94.3% of participants returning completed survey
questionnaires, 1.7% returning surveys that were 96% complete, and
the remaining
participants (
= 6) providing partially completed surveys that responded
to between 60% and 78% of the survey items.

To assess sample representativeness, we conducted chi-square tests examining
the distribution of gender, country, and academic level
among criminology
educators in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. The test results revealed that
the sample was representative in
terms of the countries (χ2 (
= .200), with no significant deviations between the observed
and expected frequencies of participants from Aotearoa New Zealand and
Australia. Similarly, the sample exhibited representativeness regarding gender
= 2) = 0.096,
= .953), as the observed deviations
in gender distribution were not statistically significant. Additionally, the
sample was representative
regarding academic level (χ2 (
= .763), with no significant deviations between the observed and
expected frequencies across various academic positions. These non-significant
p-values indicate that the observed deviations in all three tests are likely due
to random chance, rather than systematic biases
in the sample's
representativeness.
Data Analysis
To address RQ1, descriptive statistics on student disclosures to staff were
generated, including the mean number of disclosures received
by participants. As
our RQ2 dependent variable was a count variable with a negative binomial
distribution, a negative binomial regression
was used to address it. To address
RQ3, logistic regression was used to provide insights into whether educator
characteristics predicted
receiving at least one disclosure of a particular type
of crime, such as domestic, family, or sexual/whānau violence. All data
analyses were performed in SPSS.
Dependent Variables
The dependent variables were derived from two survey questions that
respectively measured the number of student disclosures participants
and the nature of these disclosures. Participants were asked, “In the
previous two years, have you had a student disclose
to you that they have been a
crime victim?” and had the option of selecting 1) no; 2) yes, one student;
or 3) yes, more than
one student. Participants who selected “yes, more
than one student” were prompted to indicate the number of disclosures
had received. If a participant indicated that they had received one or more
disclosures from students, they were asked, if they
felt comfortable to do so,
to “please briefly outline the nature of those disclosures”. Types
of crime, violence, and
trauma disclosed to participants were quantised into
categorical variables.
Predictor Variables
Gender; ethnicity; sharing/not sharing support services on unit learning
management systems; and use/non-use of content warnings in
seminars, lectures,
or other classes when teaching sensitive subjects were coded as dummy variables.
Similarly, teaching a unit addressing
sexual violence and teaching a unit
addressing intimate partner and family/whānau violence were also coded as
dummy variables.
The age variable was coded as an ordinal variable, dividing the
respondents into different age groups: 18–24, 25–34,
45–54, 55–64, and 75 or older. Recognising the potential problems
associated with multicollinearity in regression
analyses, we conducted
diagnostic assessments using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) in SPSS. The
highest VIF value we found was
1.18, and the lowest tolerance value was 0.84.
These results suggest multicollinearity was not an issue in our data (Freedman
Furthermore, having at least 10 outcomes for each predictor variable in
the regression equation is advisable to avoid affecting Type
I error, relative
bias, or other model performance metrics (Vittinghoff & McCulloch, 2007).
All our models met this condition.
The Occurrence of Student Disclosures of Crime, Violence, and Trauma
Of those who participated in our survey, 66.9% reported receiving one or more
student disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma in
the two years prior to
taking the survey. These findings indicate most criminology educators at
universities in Australia and Aotearoa
New Zealand have encountered student
disclosures. A substantial proportion of those educators who had received
disclosures had experienced
multiple instances of students sharing their
experiences in the last two years. Indeed, the mean number of student
disclosures reported
by educators was calculated to be 3.71. This figure
indicates, on average, criminology educators in Australia and Aotearoa New
had encountered approximately 3 to 4 instances of student disclosures in
the previous two years.
A notable proportion of our participants experienced a higher frequency of
student disclosures (see Table 2). Frequencies of 3 to
8 disclosures were
reported by a considerable percentage of educators, ranging from 6.7% to 14%.
Additionally, 12.4% reported receiving
10 or more student disclosures in the two
years prior to the survey. These findings demonstrate multiple student
disclosures are
not uncommon among criminology educators.

student disclosure of sexual violence in the two years preceding the survey.
Domestic and family/whānau
violence follows closely, with 35.2% of
educators (
= 62) reporting that at least one student had disclosed
experiences of domestic and family/whānau violence to them in the preceding
two years. The table highlights that sexual violence and intimate partner
violence were prominently disclosed to educators at a significantly
higher rate,
compared to other crimes. This included assault, disclosed at least once to 8.5%
of educators (
= 15), and police misconduct and brutality, disclosed at
least once by students to 5.5% of educators (

These findings provide strong empirical support for Hypothesis 1, indicating
student disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma are
common for criminology
educators at universities in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. The results
emphasise the need for educators
to be equipped with the necessary knowledge,
skills, and resources to address and respond to student disclosures effectively.
Predictors of Criminology Educators Receiving Student Disclosures of
Crime, Violence, and Trauma
Among educators aged 18 to 24, the mean number of student disclosures was
4.60. The mean number of student disclosures in the next
age bracket of 25 to 34
slightly decreased to 4.15. As the age bracket increased from 35 to 44, the mean
number of student disclosures
decreased to 3.64. Educators aged 45 to 54
reported a mean number of student disclosures of 3.53—a slight decline,
to the previous age bracket. The trend continued with educators aged 55
to 64, where the mean number of student disclosures dropped
to 2.84. Finally,
educators aged 65 to 74 had the lowest mean number of student disclosures,
recording an average of 1.20. These
findings suggest a potential relationship
between criminology educators’ age and student disclosure frequency, with
educators receiving more student disclosures than older educators.
The mean number of student disclosures for women educators was 4.75 in
comparison to male criminology educators, who had a lower mean
number of student
disclosures, with an average of 2.82. Individuals identifying as non-binary,
genderqueer, or gender-fluid reported
a mean number of student disclosures of
4.75, on par with the average reported by women. Furthermore, criminology
educators who used
a different term to describe their gender exhibited a
significantly higher mean number of student disclosures, averaging 7.50.
Building on these findings, a negative binomial regression analysis was
undertaken to examine if age or gender were statistically
significant predictors
of criminology educators receiving student disclosures. As Table 4 demonstrates,
teaching about domestic and
family/whānau violence (Exp(B)= 1.996,
= <.001) and teaching about sexual violence (Exp(B) = 1.552,
0.037) were found to be statistically significant predictors of receiving higher
numbers of disclosures from students. Criminology
educators who covered the
topic of domestic and family/whānau violence in their teaching were around
2 times more likely to
receive a higher number of student disclosures from their
students than those who did not teach this topic. Similarly, criminology
educators who taught about sexual violence were approximately 1.5 times more
likely to receive a higher number of disclosures from
their students than those
who did not. Additionally, sharing support services on online learning portals
(Exp(B) = 1.692,
= 0.018) and utilising content or trigger warnings in
lectures, tutorials, workshops, or other classes (Exp(B) = 2.092,
0.026) were found to be statistically significant predictors of receiving higher
numbers of disclosures from students. Educators
who shared support services on
their unit’s online learning portal were around 1.7 times more likely to
receive a higher number
of student disclosures than those who did not. Educators
using content or trigger warnings were around 2 times more likely to receive
student disclosures than those who did not do so.

Violence and One or More Disclosures of Domestic and Family/Whānau
Logistic regression analyses were also conducted to examine the relationship
between educator characteristics (gender, sexuality,
age, and ethnicity) and the
likelihood of receiving at least one student disclosure of sexual violence, or
at least one disclosure
of intimate partner violence. The analyses controlled
for factors including strategies for teaching sensitive topics and teaching
unit concerning the type of crime, violence, or trauma disclosed (i.e., teaching
a unit on sexual violence was included as a predictor
variable in the regression
analysis examining the relationship between educator characteristics and the
likelihood of receiving at
least one student disclosure of sexual violence).
Unsurprisingly, teaching a subject that discusses sexual violence emerged as
a statistically significant predictor of educators receiving
at least one
disclosure of sexual violence (Exp(B) = 2.978,
= 0.002). As illustrated
in Table 5, educators who taught a unit discussing sexual violence were 2.978
times more likely to receive
such disclosures, compared to those who did not
cover this topic. However, even after accounting for this variable, several
demographic
and teaching practice-related factors remained significant
predictors of educators receiving disclosures of sexual violence. Notably,
educators who identified as men (Exp(B) = 0.434,
= 0.041) were
approximately 0.434 times less likely to receive at least one disclosure of
sexual violence, compared to educators
who identified as women, non-binary, or
another gender.

Additionally, sharing support services on a subject’s online learning

Educators who engaged in sharing support services on the subject’s online
learning management system were approximately
3.115 times more likely to receive
such disclosures. The model summary statistics revealed that the included
variables accounted
for approximately 18.6% of the variance in the likelihood of
receiving student disclosures of sexual violence (Cox & Snell R
0.186, Nagelkerke R Square = 0.251).
Teaching a subject that discussed domestic and family/whānau violence
emerged as a statistically significant predictor of participants
receiving at
least one disclosure of domestic and family/whānau violence (Exp(B) =
= < 0.000). Participants teaching domestic and
family/whānau violence were approximately 5.281 times more likely to
such disclosures than educators who did not address this subject (see
table 6). Of the teaching practice-related variables, using
content or trigger
warnings in lectures, tutorials, and other classes emerged as a significant
predictor (Exp(B) = 6.674,
= 0.020). Educators who used such warnings
were approximately 6.674 times more likely to receive a disclosure of domestic
and family/whānau
violence than educators who did not. Finally, educators
who had European ancestry were 3.331 times more likely to receive at least
student disclosure of domestic and family/whānau violence than educators
who did not identify as having European ancestry
(Exp(B) = 3.331,
The domestic and family/whānau violence model showed a significant fit
to the data, as indicated by the Omnibus Tests of Model
Coefficients
(χ² = 39.065,
< 0.000). The Cox & Snell
R Square was 0.207, suggesting that the included predictor variables can explain
approximately 20.7%
of the variance in receiving disclosure of domestic and
family/whānau violence.

The findings from this study show the prevalence of crime, violence, and
trauma disclosure by students to criminology educators is
high. Notable
characteristics informing to whom students are disclosing their experiences are
identified. The study’s findings
partially support Hypothesis 2, which
suggested women educators would receive significantly more student disclosures
of crime, violence,
and trauma than men. The study found women educators had a
higher mean number of student disclosures, compared to men educators.
this difference did not reach statistical significance.
The study’s findings support Hypothesis 3, which proposed educators who
teach subjects about gender-based violence would receive
significantly more
student disclosures, compared to educators who do not teach these subjects. The
study revealed that teaching about
sexual violence and domestic and
family/whānau violence were both statistically significant predictors of
receiving disclosures
of crime, violence, and trauma from students. Educators
who covered these topics in their teaching received more student disclosures,
compared to those who did not teach about them. By examining our data further,
this finding supports Branch et al.’s (2014)
theory that women receive
higher rates of student disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma due to the
nature of the content they
teach. Women in our sample were more than twice as
likely to teach subjects discussing domestic and family/whānau violence
= 37), compared to the men who participated in our survey
= 7). Moreover, women (47.2%,
= 51) were slightly more
likely than men (40.8%,
= 20) to teach subjects that discussed sexual
In the last five years, there has been a significant focus on the prevalence
and rates of sexual violence victimisation among university
students in
Australia and in Aotearoa New Zealand (Beres et al., 2020; Tarzia et al., 2023).
Drawing on a sample of 43,819 students
at Australian universities, Heywood and
colleagues (2022) studied the prevalence of sexual violence and sexual
harassment among university
students. The research found 16% of students had
experienced sexual harassment in a university setting since beginning their
and 4.5% had experienced sexual assault in a university setting since
starting their studies. Further, 43.5% of students indicated
that they knew
nothing or very little about where to seek university support or assistance for
sexual assault, and only 25.5% sought
support from the university (Heywood et
al., 2022). Sanci et al.’s (2022) study of 14,880 undergraduate and
graduate students
in Australia found that, over the course of their lives, 8.5%
of students had experienced unwanted sexual contact, 7.3% were victim-survivors
of rape, and 7.0% were victim-survivors of an attempted rape. In a study of
1,540 university students in Aotearoa New Zealand, Beres
et al. (2020) found 28%
of students had experienced one or more forms of sexual assault, with 15% of
students experiencing rape over
the course of their lives. Of these students,
45.3% disclosed the incident to a friend or family, and 7.6% disclosed to a
professional. Only 1.6% disclosed to a university sexual violence support
service, whilst 7% disclosed to another university service
and 6.5% disclosed to
an off-campus service. Thirty-two per cent did not disclose the violence to
anybody (Beres et al., 2020, p.
61). While less is known about the prevalence of
domestic and family/whānau violence experienced by university student
populations
in Australia and Aotearoa—either non-recent, recent, or
current—the political landscape over the past decade has drawn
attention to its commonality by way of national action plans in both Australia
and Aotearoa New Zealand. This indicates the
likelihood that many students
studying at university have experienced, or are currently experiencing, domestic
and family/whānau
violence (see
National plan to end violence against
women and children 2022–2032
(DSS, 2022)).
Given the high prevalence of sexual violence experienced by university
students and the general prevalence of domestic and family/whānau
in the community (DSS, 2022; New Zealand Government, 2021), coupled with the
high levels of student disclosures of crime,
violence, and trauma of this
nature, the findings from our study are significant. They illustrate the
critical role university educators
play in supporting students. For example,
universities can attempt to lower rape myth acceptance through educational
programs. Several
evaluations of such programs have found they can decrease rape
myth acceptance (Currier & Carlson,
and increase empathy and
support for victim-survivors of sexual violence (Zapp et al., 2021). Such
programs may also increase reporting
of sexual violence on campuses. Qualitative
responses to Lindquist et al.’s (2016) survey of 3,951 undergraduate women
historically black colleges found many students believed increasing
education and/or awareness raising about sexual assault (
=346) would
increase reporting of sexual assault to police. University educators can also
play an important role in connecting victim-survivors
of violence, crime, and
trauma to appropriate internal support and criminal justice agencies (Sheffield,
Carello and Thompson (2022, p. 1) argued trauma must be reframed as
“experiences that individuals, families, and communities
must cope with
and recover from rather than as individual pathology or character flaws that
must be cured or fixed”. While
there is much debate about the utility of
trigger or content warnings (see for example, Bryce et al., 2023; Cares et al.,
these warnings are not enough for a “conscious”
trauma-informed classroom (Gubele, 2023). Trauma-informed pedagogy requires
educators to adopt measures in the classroom that “do not exacerbate and
may even mitigate trauma in the course of learning”
(Le Pichon &
Lundy, 2023, p. 30). It is not “ticking the box” at the start of a
lesson, but rather ensuring that
trauma-informed practices are weaved throughout
the curricula. This encourages educators to prioritise “connection,
reciprocity,
support, and safety” in their teaching (Concannon &
Dvorak, 2023, p. 69).
Through adopting trauma-centred practices and approaches to teaching that are
student-centred and solutions-focused, educators can
remove barriers to
2017). Such practices might include
a statement in the course syllabus that
guides students to appropriate resources for processing reactions to course
material informed
by personal experiences of crime, violence, and trauma
(Bedera, 2021; Keene & Jordan, 2021). Additionally, educators can implement
practices that allow space for students to disclose, as well as responding
sensitively and appropriately to these disclosures when
they arise, to avoid
secondary victimisation (Bedera, 2021). Educators can affirm the student’s
decision to disclose their
experience to them, validate the
victim-survivor’s experience, and emphasise that they were not to blame
for what happened
(Cares et al., 2014; Valanzola, 2021). Educators receiving
disclosures should be cognisant of victim-survivors’ need to retain
sense of agency about what they choose to do following a disclosure (McLean,
2023). Educators should avoid the use of directive
phrases such as “you
should ...,” which may be disempowering for victim-survivors (Cares et
al., 2014). Discussing the
students’ disclosure in the context of other
similar cases should also be avoided so as not to unduly influence the next
a victim-survivor should take (Valanzola, 2021). Instead, educators can
empower victim-survivors by clearly discussing available
supports and
communicating that the victim-survivor has control over what happens next,
including whether they choose to navigate
the various resources and supports
available to them (Holland & Bedera, 2020).
Limitations of the Study
Our study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting
the results and implications. Firstly, while the response
rate of 30% aligns
with expectations for list-based email surveys on salient topics, it is
important to acknowledge that most potential
participants did not respond to our
survey. This could lead to non-response bias, as the characteristics of
non-respondents may differ
from those who participated, potentially affecting
the generalisability of our findings. Further, as our study focused on
criminology
educators in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, our findings may
not be generalisable to educators in other countries with different
contexts and academic practices. Finally, while our study acknowledged the
importance of pedagogical practices, it did not
extensively explore a range of
specific teaching methods and strategies educators employ. For instance, our
survey instrument did
not thoroughly examine teaching practices such as
trauma-informed pedagogy, which emphasises creating safe and supportive learning
environments for students who may have experienced trauma (Bedera, 2021;
Zurbriggen, 2011). It is also acknowledged that follow-up
interviews could have
added further depth and nuance to the data. To address this limitation,
follow-up interviews are currently
being conducted as part of the broader
project, with the results slated for publication in a separate article. These
interviews will
provide additional context and understanding, complementing
quantitative findings reported here.
This article has explored findings from a survey about the prevalence and
predictors of disclosure of crime, violence, and trauma
to criminology educators
teaching at universities across Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. Responses
illustrated such student disclosures
are prevalent, with educators receiving an
average of 3–4 disclosures in the past two years. While gender did not
predict the
number of disclosures received, teaching subjects discussing
domestic and family/whānau and/or sexual violence increased the
of disclosures. The study’s findings raise questions about whether or how
educators are supported by their institutions
to respond appropriately to
students, and whether universities in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand have
appropriate systems and
services to support students who have disclosed crime,
violence, and trauma. Secondary traumatic stress and vicarious trauma are
uncommon among researchers studying gender-based violence and sexual abuse
(Coles et al., 2014; Cullen et al., 2021; Gleeson,
2022; Stoler, 2002). As
several scholars have noted, these can also be experienced by educators teaching
et al., 2011; Nikischer, 2019; Sheffield, 2011).
Teaching staff may also be survivors themselves (Bedera, 2021; Moore, 2023).
to vicarious trauma triggered by student disclosures requires us to
interrogate whether (and to what extent) institutional support
is provided to
university educators. As Shulz et al. (2023) emphasised, many of the self-care
strategies proposed for scholars researching
and teaching sensitive topics do
not account for the structural dimensions of researchers’ experiences and
challenges but instead
amount to neoliberalised self-care practices. As such,
future research ought to investigate whether and how university educators
supported to respond to student disclosures of crime, violence, and trauma and
the strategies employed by educators to ensure
safety in the classroom.

Terminology for academic
positions varies by jurisdiction. In this study, ongoing educators typically
hold permanent positions with
tenure; contract educators are individuals on
fixed-term contracts, such as post-doctoral positions lasting two years or
appointments; and sessional educators are adjunct or contingent faculty
hired each semester for individual units.
Australia uses the term
“domestic and family violence” while Aotearoa New Zealand uses the
term “whānau violence”—whānau
translates to family
in te reo Māori language.

that the victim is lying about the assault (Payne, Lonsway and Fitzgerald
