Workers’ Compensation Review
PIVOVAROFF AND WORKCOVER CORPORATION (ADELAIDE POWDER
(04710566/04/01)
Determination of Review Officer
made on 15th September, 1994
(Hearings 5th September,
Review Officer Russell
This is the determination of an application by Mr. James Pivovaroff as
worker under a contract of service with Adelaide Powder Coating
as employer, for
a review of a decision purportedly made on 7th July, 1994 not to make a further
appointment for the worker for a
medical assessment of the extent of his
permanent disabilities.
At the hearing Mr Pivovaroff represented himself,
and WorkCover was represented by Ms Sue Campbell, Case Manager.
"decision" of which Mr Pivovaroff seeks a review is contained in a letter to him
dated 7th July, 1994 which stated, amongst other
"With regards to your second letter, we advise that we will not be making a
further appointment for you with AGHS, and we will not
be assigning you a new
claim number. If you are dissatisfied with this decision, feel free to lodge a
review application, however,
the Review Officer may not have jurisdiction to
hear your grievance."
On the day of the hearing, at which a number of
other review applications by Mr. Pivovaroff were considered, I indicated to him
in my view, no reviewable decision had been made, and therefore I have no
my reasons in writing,
and I now provide those reasons.
The background to the application is
that the worker suffered disabilities to his right knee and his lower back on
31st August, 1989.
These disabilities have been accepted as compensable, but as
yet no decision has been made by WorkCover as to whether those disabilities
permanent, thereby entitling him to a lump sum for non-economic loss pursuant to
s.43 of the Act. Earlier this year, WorkCover
referred the worker to the
Australian Government Health Service (AGHS) for an assessment of any permanent
disability of the lower
back and the right knee. In a report dated 1st April,
1994, Dr. Richards, AGHS Medical Adviser, prepared a report for WorkCover
which he gives an assessment of permanent disabilities of the right leg and the
lumbar spine. I understand from the worker that,
subsequent to that assessment,
he had several falls at home, which he believes may have worsened his
disabilities. He is of the
view that the AGHS assessment may therefore be out
of date. In a letter to WorkCover dated 27th June, 1994 he stated:-
"Than (sic) you for your letter dated 21 June 1994. I do not understand your
reluctant position regarding my request for re-assessment.
I insist on a
re-assessment of my physical disabilities, in my present state. You say no.
You say 'Non compensable incidents (ie.
falls at home)' is not true. These
falls at home and my present condition relate directly to my injuries that are
documented with
Workcover, which form part of my claim with Workcover. This
deterioration does have an 'Impact upon the entitlements'.
I appeal to Workcover against your refusal for re-assessment."
this letter which WorkCover responded to on 7th July, 1994.
Section 94(2)
of the Act sets out those decisions which may be reviewed by a Review Officer.
It states as follows:-
"(2) The following decisions are reviewable:-
(a) a decision made on a claim for compensation (including a decision in the
nature of redetermination of a claim);
(b) a decision in relation to the nature of rehabilitation services provided,
or to be provided, for a worker;
(c) a decision to vary, suspend or discontinue weekly payments;
(d) a decision on an application by an employer under Section 36 to have
weekly payments payable to a worker employed by, or formerly
employed by, that
employer reviewed;
(da) a decision by the Corporation to disallow a charge for a service under
section 32;"
The last category refers to costs of medical services and
The jurisdiction of a Review Officer is limited by this section
to decisions of the type set out in subparagraphs (a) to (da). The
contained in WorkCover's letter of 7th July, 1994 clearly does not fall in the
categories (b), (c), (d) or (da). The
only possible category it might come
under is (a), that is "a decision made on a claim for compensation". However,
it is plain to
me that WorkCover has made no decision on Mr. Pivovaroff's claim.
In my view, a "decision" is something that says that a worker is
entitled, or
not entitled, to certain benefits resulting from a claim. In Mr. Pivovaroff's
case, the particular entitlement which
the AGHS assessment refers to is the
entitlement to a lump sum for non-economic loss resulting from a compensable
disability. However,
WorkCover have made no decision as yet about the
entitlement. It has simply said to the worker that it will not seek any further
medical assessment for the purposes of determining that entitlement.
my view, if WorkCover does not believe any further medical assessments are
required, then it ought to proceed to make a determination
of the worker's
entitlement. Then, if Mr. Pivovaroff is not satisfied with that determination,
he may seek a review of it under
s.95(2)(a) of the Act. Ms. Campbell indicated
at the hearing that she would proceed to make such a determination. If that
not occur, and Mr. Pivovaroff believes that such determination can and
should be made, then he may lodge an application under s.102
of the Act, seeking
the assistance of a Review Officer in having that determination made on the
basis that there has been undue delay
in making it. However, I understand that
is not Mr. Pivovaroff's concern. Rather, it is his view that, having suffered
some further
incidents allegedly affecting the extent of his disability, he is
entitled to a more recent medical assessment for the purposes of
determining his
entitlement. It is clear to me that he would only be entitled to a greater
assessment than that already made by
the AGHS if those further incidents are
themselves accepted as compensable, and did indeed permanently worsen his
condition. If
the falls had occurred while he was working, then undoubtedly a
claim in relation to such incidents would be accepted as compensable.
circumstances of the falls, namely that they occurred at home, then there must
be a question mark over whether any worsening
of this condition due to those
falls should be accepted as related to the compensable disabilities. In order
to establish any entitlement
to benefits for any worsening of his condition, Mr.
Pivovaroff would need to lodge a claim for compensation in relation to those
incidents, and have that claim accepted. Only then would it be appropriate to
have a more recent medical assessment done, for the
purposes of assessing the
permanence and extent of his current disabilities.
For these reasons, I
consider that there has not been a reviewable decision made, to which the
application for review relates, and
therefore I am unable to exercise my
Any appeal against this
determination must be lodged with the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal
within one month of the receipt
of this determination. Enquiries about appeals
may be directed to the Registrar of the Tribunal, Riverside Centre, North
Adelaide (Phone: 207 0960), and forms for appeal are available from the
same address.
