CASE NOTE F
In the matter of an application under
section 153
Liquor Control
Reform Act 1998
for the internal review of a decision to refuse to transfer
a liquor licence.
Commission:
Ms Deirdre O’Donnell, Deputy Chair
Ms Danielle Huntersmith, Commissioner
Mr Andrew Scott, Commissioner
Date of Hearing
17 November 2021
Date of Decision:
7 December 2021
Date of Publication:
8 December 2021
The Commission has determined to set aside the decision of
the Delegate and, in substitution, grant the application to transfer the
1. During 2020, the Victorian Commission for Gambling
and Liquor Regulation (
received an
application under the
Liquor Control Reform Act
) for the transfer of a general liquor licence (
the Original
Application
2. In accordance with section 33(1) of the LCR Act, a copy of the Original
Application was served on a Victoria Police licensing inspector
) and Victoria Police objected to the transfer on grounds that the
applicant was not a suitable person to hold the liquor licence,
(a) the applicant had previously been charged with criminal offences relating to
their cultivation, use and possession of cannabis;
(b) the applicant made incorrect statements within the Original Application,
relating to their suitability and criminal history.
3. During 2021, a delegate of the Commission
determined to refuse to grant the transfer of the liquor licence, pursuant to
44(2)(a) of the LCR Act, on grounds that the applicant was not a
suitable person to hold the Licence (
Original Decision
being charged with criminal offences relating to the possession, use and
cultivation of cannabis.
4. The applicant then applied for the internal review of the Original
Review Application
) and provided material as
evidence that:
(a) their incorrect statement with respect to their criminal history was made
because they incorrectly believed that the criminal
charges had been discharged
when the Original Application was submitted; and
(b) the behaviour relating to the criminal charges occurred because the
applicant was seeking relief from symptoms of a medical condition,
which was now
treated through medically prescribed cannabis.
5. The Commission accepted the Applicant’s submissions that they had
suffered from mental health issues and chronic debilitating
pain at the time of
their offending, which was not being appropriately treated and would not occur
again. The Commission was also
satisfied that the applicant’s failure to
accurately describe the status of their criminal charges was a mistake rather
an attempt to deliberately mislead the Commission.
6. The Commission therefore determined to set aside the decision of the
delegate and grant the application to transfer the licence.
7. The Commission has decided not to public its reasons for decision in this
instance due to considerations relating to the applicant’s
criminal and
medical history.
