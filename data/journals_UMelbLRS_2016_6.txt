Constitutions, Gender and Freedom of Expression: The Legal Regulation of
Pornography
Katharine Gelber and Adrienne Stone
The constitutions of democratic states universally contain protection for
freedom of expression or a closely related right, such as
‘speech’ or ‘opinion’ (Stone 2011). Feminist thought has
much to offer the study of this right.
For instance, the ‘social
constructivist’ commitments of some feminists, which hold that knowledge
is constructed through
interactions with others in particular social contexts,
offer a lens through which to critique and reconstruct notions of truth and
autonomy that underscore traditional rationales for freedom of expression
(Williams 2009). However, with some notable exceptions
(Williams 2005, 2009;
Brison 1998, 2000), feminist thought has not focused as much on freedom of
expression as it has on some other
constitutional questions, such as rights to
equality, privacy and reproductive freedom, and legal regulation of the family
and Rubio-Marin 2005).
A glaring exception to this ‘gap’ between feminist legal thought
and freedom of expression arises in relation to the legal
regulation of
‘pornography’ The question of whether freedom of expression protects
pornography from regulation has been
among the most important — and
certainly high profile — forums for the engagement of constitutional law
with feminist
ideas. There is, on the one hand, a strongly defended view that
the regulation of pornography collides with the protection of freedom
expression as a matter of both theory (Ronald Dworkin 1996) and law (Weinstein
1999). That view is subject to a significant challenge
from feminist scholars
discussed in this chapter (though as we note that other feminists defend it).
This debate has also played
out in constitutional law in a number of countries
and has been discussed in the comparative literature on freedom of expression.
The variety and depth of constitutional thought around the regulation of
pornography make it an especially revealing study of the
intersection of gender
and constitutionalism.
Before proceeding, further, we should acknowledge that the concept of
‘pornography’ is controversial. We explore its complexities
and in particular the feminist conception of pornography – in this
chapter. We begin with a review of traditional approaches
to the regulation of
sexually explicit material, usually framed as the regulation of
‘obscenity’, a concept that focus
on the capacity of sexually
explicit depictions to corrupt morals . We then turn to the ground-breaking work
of Andrea Dworkin and
Catharine MacKinnon, which reframed the constitutional
question posed by the phenomenon of ‘pornography’ which cast erotic
sexual depictions as necessarily involving the subordination of women.
We then examine the debate that ensued through three lenses. First we turn to
the philosophical foundations of the arguments, which
have been elaborated and
further defended by Rae Langton and others. Next we turn to the influence on law
(specifically the
constitutional law of Canada) of the feminist argument for the regulation of
pornography. The Canadian case law on this question provided
a sharp contrast
with the constitutional law of the United States. We trace the sources and
nature of this difference, showing in
particular the force of the feminist
critique of pornography in Canadian constitutional law and reflecting on the
differences between
American and Canadian law on this question. Lastly, we
broaden our comparative lens to consider other jurisdictions noting that the
feminist critique of pornography has had little effect beyond the constitutional
law of Canada (though some analogous ideas are evident
in German law) and
conclude by noting some fruitful avenues for future research.
1. Preliminaries: Framing the Constitutional Question
A. Pornography and the Concept of “Speech”’
The debates about the legal regulation of pornography examined in this
chapter assume the truth of two propositions. The first, which
accepted, is that constitutional rights of freedom of expression typically
expressive conduct
as well as to the written and spoken word.
This is true even where constitutions use other terms like
’. Thus despite the use of the term ‘the freedom
in the text of the First Amendment to the
Constitution
of the United States
, that right has long been understood as
extending to expressive conduct like the display of flags or wearing of armbands
Stromberg v California
Tinker v Des Moines Independent School District
). Indeed, despite the
variation in the terminology of these rights, there is a great deal of overlap
in the phenomena to which they
apply. (For this reason this chapter will
generally refer to ‘expression’ unless it is necessary to
distinguish between
‘expression’ and ‘speech’ or some
other related concept).
The second proposition assumed here is that is that pornography is
‘expressive’ and thus comes within the scope of a constitutional
right of freedom of expression. This position is widely accepted but not
entirely uncontroversial. Frederick Schauer, for instance,
maintains that
pornography – at least in many of its typical forms – is essentially
an aide to sexual activity and therefore
has more in common with sex (which is
not within the scope of any principle of freedom of expression) than it does
with ‘expression’
or ‘speech’ (Schauer 1982, 181).
Despite these views, pornography is typically regarded as expressive and
therefore within
the scope of constitutional protection. This chapter proceeds
on that basis and pursues the question of whether the regulation of
pornography
is a permissible
on rights of freedom of expression.
B. From Obscenity to Pornography
The use of the word ‘pornography’ to describe the kind of
expression that is the subject of this chapter immediately locates
our analysis
in feminist approaches. In the more traditional
