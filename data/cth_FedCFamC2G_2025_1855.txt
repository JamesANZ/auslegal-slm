REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
JUDGE RILEY:
INTRODUCTION
is an application in relation to alleged trade mark infringement and defamation.
applicant is Raymond Hoser. He has been involved in many legal proceedings in
various courts relating to alleged trade mark infringement
and defamation.
Following an unsuccessful action, Mr Hoser has also been issued with a
bankruptcy notice, which he is in the process
of challenging.
respondent in the present matter is Stelios Eleftheriou. He did not file any
documents in this proceeding or appear at any of
the hearings in this
proceeding. However, for the reasons discussed below, I am satisfied that he was
personally served with the
initiating documents and numerous other documents
relating to the proceeding. I am also satisfied that he was given adequate
of the final hearing.
SERVICE ON MR ELEFTHERIOU
relation to the initiating documents, Matthew John Stephens swore an affidavit
on 18 October 2024 in which he said that:
(a) he handed to Mr Eleftheriou on 8 October 2024:
(i) the application;
(ii) the statement of claim;
(iii) the affidavits sworn by Mr Hoser on 31 July 2024 and 23 September 2024;
(iv) the genuine steps statement; and
(b) he identified Mr Eleftheriou based on the following conversation:
(i) “Are you Stelios Eleftheriou the person named as the first respondent
in this matter involving Raymond Hoser?”
(ii) “Yes, I know what this is about, this guy is harassing me.”
application served on Mr Eleftheriou showed that the matter was listed for
directions on 5 September 2024. Mr Hoser appeared in
person. Mr Eleftheriou did
not appear. It seems that, at that stage, he had not been served. The second
respondent, JC Decaux International
Pty Ltd, did not appear either. Orders were
(a) adjourning the matter to 15 October 2024 for directions;
(b) requiring Mr Hoser to file and serve an amended application, an amended
statement of claim, and a further affidavit in support;
(c) requiring Mr Hoser to serve a copy of the order made on 5 September 2024 on
the respondents.
15 October 2024, Mr Hoser again appeared on his own behalf. Neither of the
respondents appeared. It seems that, by this time, Mr
Eleftheriou had been
personally served with the initiating documents listed above, but not with the
order made on 5 September 2024
which adjourned the matter to 15 October 2024. On
that date, orders were made:
(a) removing the second respondent as a party;
(b) requiring Mr Hoser to ensure that a copy of the order made on 15 October
2024 was personally served on Mr Eleftheriou; and
(c) adjourning the matter to 15 November 2024 for directions.
Stephens swore a second affidavit on 18 October 2024 in which he said that he
had handed to Mr Eleftheriou on 16 October 2024 the
order made on 15 October
2024. On that occasion, the following conversation occurred:
(a) “Hi Stelios, I have some more documents for you in regards to that
last matter I spoke to you about regarding Raymond Hoser.”
(b) “OK, no worries.”
15 November 2024, Mr Hoser again appeared on his own behalf and Mr Eleftheriou
did not appear. Mr Hoser was ordered to file and
serve a further amended
statement of claim and serve a copy of the order on Mr Eleftheriou. Mr
Eleftheriou was ordered to file and
serve a defence. He did not do so. The
matter was adjourned to 17 March 2025 for directions.
28 January 2025, Mr Stephens swore a further affidavit in which he said that he
had personally handed to Mr Eleftheriou on 25 January
2025 a copy of the further
amended statement of claim dated 22 January 2025. On that occasion, the
following conversation occurred:
(a) “Hi Stelios, I have some more documents for you in regards to the
matter I spoke to you about on previous occasions regarding
(b) “OK thanks.”
2 March 2025, Mr Hoser filed an application for default judgment against Mr
Eleftheriou and an affidavit in support. The application
was made returnable on
17 March 2025. Mr Stephens swore an affidavit on 11 March 2025 in which he said
that he personally handed
to Mr Eleftheriou on 7 March 2025 a copy of the
application filed on 2 March 2025 and the affidavit in support. On that
the following conversation occurred:
(a) “Hi Stelios, I have some more documents for you in regards to the
matter I have spoken to you about previously regarding
Raymond Hoser.”
(b) “OK thanks.”
Eleftheriou did not attend the hearing of the default judgment application on 17
March 2025. The court heard Mr Hoser’s application
for default judgment,
but dismissed it for the reasons given in
Hoser v Eleftheriou
FedCFamC2G 392.
In brief terms, the application for default judgment was
dismissed on the basis that:
(a) Mr Hoser’s alleged trade marks of “Snakeman” or
“Snake man” were descriptive terms; and
(b) the defamation claim did not arise from substantially the same or closely
related facts to those in the trade mark claim, so
the court did not have
associated jurisdiction.
17 March 2024, as well as dismissing the application for default judgment, the
court listed the matter for final hearing on 30
May 2025, and required Mr Hoser
to file and serve any further affidavit.
Hoser did not personally serve on Mr Eleftheriou the orders made on 17 March
2025. However, Mr Hoser did file an affidavit of service
on 27 May 2025 in which
he said that he had served on Mr Eleftheriou, by email, the orders made on 17
March 2025 and his affidavit
sworn on 30 April 2025. Mr Hoser said he sent the
email on 25 May 2025 to
Stelios.eleftheriou05@gmail.com
another affidavit sworn by Mr Hoser on 27 May 2025, he said that he had used an
email checker to confirm that the email had been
received by Mr Eleftheriou. Mr
Hoser also said in his affidavit that he had heard Mr Eleftheriou say on a
TikTok channel that he
had received emails from Mr Hoser at
Stelios.eleftheriou05@gmail.com
Mr Hoser also noted at the final hearing that the court had sent emails to Mr
Eleftheriou at the
Stelios.eleftheriou05@gmail.com
address, and they had not bounced back. That is true.
in all, I accept that Mr Eleftheriou was given adequate notice of the final
hearing on 30 May 2025. He did not attend the final
hearing. Therefore, Mr
Hoser’s evidence is unchallenged. I accept it, except where otherwise

can be seen, the owner of the trade marks relied on by Mr Hoser is Adelyn
Kimberley Hoser. Ms Hoser is Mr Hoser’s daughter.
She attended the final
hearing with him.
Hoser said that he was licenced by Ms Hoser to use both trade marks. Mr Hoser
evidenced that claim with the last page of appendix

23 September 2024, which is as follows:

Date: 1/10/21
Trade Marks Act 1995
(“the TMA”), a licensee of a trade
mark is known as an authorised user. Section 26 of the TMA provides that:
(1) Subject to any agreement between the registered owner of a registered trade
mark and an authorised user of the trade mark, the
authorised user may do any of
the following:
(b) the authorised user may (subject to subsection (2)) bring an action for
infringement of the trade mark:
(i) at any time, with the
consent of the registered owner; or
(ii) during the prescribed period, if the registered owner refuses to bring such
an action on a particular occasion during the prescribed
(iii) after the end of the prescribed period, if the registered owner has failed
to bring such an action during the prescribed period;
(2) If the authorised user brings an action for infringement of the trade mark,
the authorised user must make the registered owner
of the trade mark a defendant
in the action. However, the registered owner is not liable for costs if he or
she does not take part
in the proceedings.
means that an authorised user may bring an action for infringement of a trade
mark if the authorised user makes the owner of
the trade mark a defendant in the
action. In the present case, that would mean that Mr Hoser was entitled to bring
an action for
trade mark infringement but only if he joined Ms Hoser as a
defendant. He did not do so. That means that Mr Hoser’s claim for
infringement of registered trade marks is fatally flawed.
Additionally,
Mr Hoser did not plead or give evidence that Ms Hoser consented to him bringing
this infringement action, or, alternatively,
had refused or failed to bring a
relevant infringement action. For this reason also, Mr Hoser’s claim for
infringement of registered
trade marks is fatally flawed.
Hoser faces another difficulty in the trade marks claim. The term,
“authorised user”, is defined in s.8 of the TMA.
That section
provides that:
(1) A person is an authorised user of a trade mark if the person uses the trade
mark in relation to goods or services under the control
of the owner of the
trade mark.
(2) The use of a trade mark by an authorised user of the trade mark is an
authorised use of the trade mark to the extent only that
the user uses the trade
mark under the control of the owner of the trade mark.
(3) If the owner of a trade mark exercises quality control over goods or
(a) dealt with or provided in the course of trade by another person; and
(b) in relation to which the trade mark is used;
the other person is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to use the trade
mark in relation to the goods or services under the
control of the owner.
(a) a person deals with or provides, in the course of trade, goods or services
in relation to which a trade mark is used; and
(b) the owner of the trade mark exercises financial control over the other
person's relevant trading activities;
the other person is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to use the trade
mark in relation to the goods or services under the
control of the owner.
(5) Subsections (3) and (4) do not limit the meaning of the expression
under the control of
in subsections (1) and (2).
is nothing in the agreement set out above between Mr Hoser and Ms Hoser that
indicates that Ms Hoser has any right to control
Mr Hoser’s use of her
trade marks.
does the further amended statement of claim (“FASOC”) plead that Ms
Hoser has any right to control Mr Hoser’s
use of the trade marks. On the
contrary, paragraph 12 of the FASOC pleads that Mr Hoser was licensed to use the
trade marks “as
if owned by him”.
the affidavit evidence filed by Mr Hoser does not disclose any control by Ms
Hoser over the use of her trade marks. On
the contrary, in paragraph 12 of his
affidavit sworn on 23 September 2024, Mr Hoser said that Ms Hoser assigned to
him by deed (which
the document set out above is not) the right to use her trade
marks “as if owned by myself”.
follows that Mr Hoser does not have a licence to bring this action for
infringement of his daughter’s trade marks.
COMMON LAW TRADE MARKS
Mt Hoser claimed at paragraph 13 of his FASOC that he owned all the common law
rights to the trade marks, “snakeman”
and “snake man”.
He said that he had been widely known as the “snake man” since the
1970s. As can be seen
from the registrations set out above, the trade marks,
“snakeman” and “snake man”, were registered in 2007.
Hoser said at paragraph 15 of his affidavit sworn on 31 July 2024 that he
transferred the trade marks to Ms Hoser on 1 October
2021, who then licensed Mr
Hoser to use them. It is implicit in that evidence that Mr Hoser was the owner
of the trade marks, “snake
man” and “snakeman”, at the
time of their initial registration in 2007.
that as it may, Mr Hoser’s common law rights have now been overtaken by
the registration of the trade marks, “snakeman”
DESCRIPTIVE TERMS
any event, under s.122(1) of the TMA:
In spite of section 120, a person does not infringe a registered trade mark
(b) the person uses a sign in good faith to indicate:
(i) the kind ... of ... services;
is generally understood as meaning that, if a supposed trade mark is a
descriptive term, it is not infringed by another person
using the same
descriptive term.
Hoser said that “snakeman” and “snake man” were not
descriptive terms for what he does, which is catching
snakes, and displaying
snakes. He said that “snakeman” and “snake man” were
descriptive terms for a man who
dresses up as a snake. That might be one
understanding of the terms “snakeman” and “snake man”.
words can have multiple meanings and describe multiple different
a scientific environment, a snake man might be a man who studies snakes, just as
Jane Goodall was known as the chimpanzee lady
and Dian Fossey was known as the
gorilla lady.
an occupational sense, the term, fireman, is descriptive of a man who puts out
fires. The term, garbageman, is descriptive of a
man who collects garbage. The
term, postman, is descriptive of a man who delivers the post.
Hoser said that the terms, “snakeman” and “snake man”,
were not descriptive of what he does, because he
is called a snake catcher or a
snake displayer. That might be technically correct. However, just because there
is a technically
correct descriptive term for a particular occupation does not
mean that other terms are not also descriptive of that occupation.
For example,
it is technically correct to describe a person who forecasts the weather as a
meteorologist. However, that person might
also be known in common parlance, and
be accurately described, as a weatherman.
if someone found a snake in their backyard, they could quite properly shout out,
“Quick, call a snake man!”
Everyone would know that what was
required was a snake catcher. Hence, “snakeman” and “snake
man” are perfectly
adequate descriptions for a snake catcher.
someone wanted to host a snake display or exhibition, perhaps for a
children’s birthday party, they might say, “We
should call that
snake man”. While “snake displayer” or “snake
exhibiter” might be more technically
correct, “snake man”, in
context, is a perfectly clear description of the relevant occupation.

respondent’s trade mark registration extract dated 30
May 2025 for

STELTHESNAKEMAN
STEL_THESNAKEMAN
this extract, it can be seen that Mr Eleftheriou added “Stel_the”
before the words, “snakeman” and added
“Stel” before the
words “thesnakeman”. I infer that the addition of
“Stel_the” and “Stel”
was an effort by Mr Eleftheriou to
distinguish his services from Mr Hoser’s. The various alleged
infringements nominated by
Mr Hoser all show that Mr Eleftheriou used the term,
“Stel the snake man”, or equivalent. I consider that the addition
“Stel_the” is indicative of good faith on Mr Eleftheriou’s
follows that the trade marks, “snakeman” and “snake
man”, were not infringed by Mr Eleftheriou because
they are descriptive
terms that he used in good faith to indicate the type of services he provided.
SUBSTANTIAL IDENTITY AND DECEPTIVE SIMILARITY
are further reasons that Mr Hoser cannot succeed in his infringements claim.
Subsection 120(1) of the TMA provides that:
A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a
sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively
similar to, the trade
mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is
registered.
10 of the TMA provides that:
For the purposes of this Act, a trade mark is taken to be deceptively similar to
another trade mark if it so nearly resembles that
other trade mark that it is
likely to deceive or cause confusion.
Hoser argued that “Stel_thesnakeman” was substantially identical
with “snakeman” and “snake man”.
This is obviously a
question of degree and perception. However, the test is objective, as explained
by the High Court in
Self Care IP Holdings Pty Ltd v Allergan Australia Pty
(2023) 277 CLR 186
(2023) 408 ALR 195
(2023) 97 ALJR 388
[2023] HCA 8
The question to be asked under s 120(1) is artificial — it is an objective
question based on a construct. The focus is upon
the effect or impression
produced on the mind of potential customers. The buyer posited by the test is
notional (or hypothetical),
although having characteristics of an actual group
of people. The notional buyer is understood by reference to the nature and kind
of customer who would be likely to buy the goods [or services] covered by the

test for deceptive similarity was expressed in
at 109 CLR 415-6 as
The marks are not now to be looked at side by side [as for substantial
identity]. The issue is not abstract similarity, but deceptive
similarity ...
the comparison ... is between, on the one hand, the impression based on
recollection of the plaintiff's mark that
persons of ordinary intelligence and
memory would have; and, on the other hand, the impression that such persons
would get from the
defendant's [alleged trade mark]...
[The] deceptiveness that is contemplated must result from similarity; but the
likelihood of deception must be judged not by the degree
of similarity alone,
but by the effect of that similarity in all the circumstances.

my view, the present case is more like the first two cases than the second two
cases. As in the first two cases, the addition of

That is different from the Crazy John’s case,
because “Crazy John’s” sounds a lot like “Crazy

, Gaudron J explained three ways in which the jurisdiction of the Federal
Court, and, by extension, this court, may be expanded.
Her Honour said at
The first is specific statutory provision, such as that which confers
and contravention of
Workplace Relations Act
[1]. It is well settled that that jurisdiction
may extend to the determination of the entire matter or controversy and, thus,
non-federal claims which involve the same transactions and facts[2].
However, it does not extend to "a 'completely disparate claim
constituting in
substance a separate proceeding' ..., a non-federal matter which is 'completely
separate and distinct from the matter
which attracted federal jurisdiction' ...
or 'some distinct and unrelated non-federal claim'"[3].

follows also that, though the facts upon which a non-federal claim arises do not
wholly coincide with the facts upon which a federal
claim arises, it is
nevertheless possible that both may be aspects of a single matter arising under
a federal law. Mason J.
in Philip Morris
(1981) 148 CLR, at 512,
following what was said in
Moorgate Tobacco
[1980] HCA 32
(1980) 145 CLR 457
indication of a non-federal claim which would not be
Likewise, it may appear that the attached claim and the federal claim so depend
on common transactions and facts that they arise
out of a common substratum of
facts. In instances of this kind a court which exercises federal jurisdiction
will have jurisdiction
to determine the attached claim as an element in the
exercise of its federal jurisdiction.
His Honour's reference to a dependence of federal and non-federal claims upon
common transactions and facts approximates the test
United Mine Workers of
America v. Gibbs
(1966) 383 US, at p 725 (16 Law Ed (2d), at p 228) that the
claims "must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact". ...
it is not possible to devise so precise a formula that its application to the
facts of any controversy would determine accurately
what claims are disparate
and what claims are not. Whatever formula be adopted as a guide - and the
formula of "common transactions
and facts" is a sound guide for the purpose - it
must result in leaving outside the ambit of a matter a "completely disparate
constituting in substance a separate proceeding" (per Barwick C.J. in
Felton v. Mulligan
(1971) 124 CLR, at p 373), a non-federal matter which
is "completely separate and distinct from the matter which attracted federal
Philip Morris
(1981) 148 CLR, at p 521)
or "some distinct and unrelated non-federal claim" (per Stephen, Mason, Aickin
and Wilson JJ. in
Moorgate Tobacco
(1980) 145 CLR, at p 482).
But in the end, it is a matter of impression and of practical judgment whether a
non-federal claim and a federal claim joined
in a proceeding are within the
scope of one controversy and thus within the ambit of a matter.

, Mason J (as his Honour then was) said in
(1981) 148 CLR 457
The classification of a claim as "non-severable" does not necessarily mean that
it is, or must be, united to the federal claim by
a single claim for relief,
though this is a common illustration of a non-severable claim. The non-severable
character of the attached
claim may emerge from other aspects of the
relationship between the federal and the attached claim. For example, it may
appear that
the resolution of the attached claim is essential to a determination
of the federal question. Likewise, it may appear that the attached
claim and the
federal claim so depend on common transactions and facts that they arise out of
a common substratum of facts. In instances
of this kind a court which exercises
federal jurisdiction will have jurisdiction to determine the attached claim as
an element in
the exercise of its federal jurisdiction.
the present case, Mr Hoser said this court had jurisdiction in relation to his
defamation claim because Mr Eleftheriou defamed
him after Mr Hoser sent him a
cease and desist letter in relation to the alleged trade mark infringement, and
used the name, “Stel_thesnakeman”,
in subsequent defamatory posts.
However, the alleged trade mark infringement was simply the background to the
defamation claim, or
the context in which it occurred. The determination of the
defamation claim is not essential to the determination of the trade mark
The trade mark claim, and the defamation claim do not share a “common
substratum of facts”, or at least, of material
facts. Mr Hoser’s
argument is like saying that the trade mark claim and the defamation claim are
non-severable because Mr
Eleftheriou was wearing the same jacket when he
allegedly infringed the trade marks and when he allegedly defamed Mr Hoser. The
(being the alleged trade mark infringement) in which the defamation
claims arose does not impact on the matters that need to be determined
defamation claim (being what words Mr Eleftheriou used and what the imputations
of those words might be).
J continued in
The second source of jurisdiction is
Federal Court of
Australia Act
(Cth) ("the
Federal Court Act
"). That sub-section confers
additional jurisdiction in these terms:
To the extent that the
Constitution
permits, jurisdiction is conferred on the
court in respect of matters not otherwise within its jurisdiction that are
associated with
matters in which the jurisdiction of the court is invoked.
Philip Morris Inc v Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd

embraces matters which
may be disparate from each other"[4], a view which is implicit in other
judgments in that case[5].

... Accordingly, the question whether, if the conspiracy claims are not part of
the one controversy, they fall within

no more than a question of practical judgment as to whether they are associated
with the claims alleging the breaches and
contraventions earlier referred to.

, Gibbs J, as his Honour then was, said in
(1981) 148 CLR 457
... Speaking generally it may be said that, given identity of parties, one
matter is associated with another if the two matters arise
out of substantially
the same, or closely connected, facts ...
would appear to be no constitutional impediment to the court exercising
Mr Eleftheriou and
there is also an identity of parties in the trade mark matter and the defamation
matter. The remaining issue is
whether the trade mark matter and the defamation
matter “arise out of substantially the same or closely connected
I do not consider that they do.
trade mark matter arises out of the alleged fact that Mr Eleftheriou infringed
Mr Hoser’s supposed trade marks. The defamation
matter arises out of the
alleged fact that Mr Eleftheriou defamed Mr Hoser.
trade mark matter had subsidiary facts such as that the trade mark was
registered, that Mr Hoser was licensed to use the trade
mark, and that Mr
Eleftheriou allegedly used the trade mark without permission. The defamation
matter had subsidiary facts such as
that Mr Eleftheriou published certain
statements about Mr Hoser, and those statements carried certain imputations.
trade mark matter cannot, on any view, be regarded as “arising out of
substantially the same or closely connected facts”
as the defamation
matter. It is immaterial that the defamation matter coincided with the trade
mark matter at their inception. That
was just background and context, that
played no operative part in either matter. The trade mark matter arose out of
the alleged trade
mark infringement by Mr Eleftheriou. The defamation matter
arose out allegedly defamatory statements published by Mr Eleftheriou.
J noted in paragraph 7 of
that the third source of jurisdiction is
the cross-vesting scheme. Mr Hoser did not seek to rely on the cross-vesting
in all, I consider that this court does not have jurisdiction in the present
case in relation to Mr Hoser’s defamation claim.
the reasons stated above, the application must be dismissed.
