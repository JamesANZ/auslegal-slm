applicants seek special leave to appeal from the whole of the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales (Ward P,
Payne and Adamson JJA), which dismissed an appeal from the Supreme
Court of New South Wales (Ball J).
proposed appeal does not have sufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant
of special leave, nor would it otherwise be
a suitable vehicle to consider the
application of the principle of reflective loss.
leave to appeal is refused with costs.
