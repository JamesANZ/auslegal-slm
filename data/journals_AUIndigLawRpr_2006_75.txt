Amendment Act 2006 (Cth)
Act No 93 of 2006
Assented to 5 September 2006
Introduction
Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act 2006
(Cth) represents a number of distinct changes to Australian land rights
legislation. Most notably, in amending the
Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern
Territory) Act 1976
(Cth), the new legislation potentially makes the powers
of Land Councils delegable to other authorities, and facilitates the granting
99-year leases over Aboriginal townships.
19A Land Trust may grant headlease over township
Grant of lease
(1) A Land Trust may grant a lease of a township to an approved entity if:
(a) the Minister consents, in writing, to the grant of the lease; and
(b) the Land Council for the area in which the land is situated directs, in
writing, the Land Trust to grant the lease.
Term of lease
(4) Subject to subsection (5), the term of a lease granted under this
section is 99 years.
Transfer of lease
(8) A lease granted under this section must not be transferred, except to
another approved entity with the written approval of the
Minister. An approval
is not a legislative instrument.
(13) This section does not prevent a sublease of a lease granted under this
(14) A lease granted under this section must not contain any provision
requiring the consent of any person to the grant of a sublease
of the lease.
(15) A lease granted under this section must not contain any provision
relating to the payment of rent, or the non-payment of rent,
in relation to a
sublease of the lease.
65 After section 28
28A Delegation of a Land Council’s functions or
powers to body corporate
Application
(1) A body corporate incorporated under the
Aboriginal Councils and
Associations Act 1976
may, in writing, apply to a Land Council to have the
Council delegate to the body some or all of the Council’s functions or
powers that are delegable to the body if a majority of the members of the body
are either:
(a) the traditional Aboriginal owners of land in the part of the area of the
Council mentioned in paragraph (2)(b); or
(b) Aboriginals who live in that part.
out which of the Council’s functions or powers are delegable to the body.
28B Variation or revocation of a delegation to body
(1) If a Land Council delegates some or all of its functions or powers under
to a body corporate, the Council must not vary or revoke the
delegation except as set out in this section.
28C Minister may agree to delegation or variation if
Land Council refuses to do so
(a) a Land Council refuses, or is taken to have refused, under section 28A to
make a delegation to a body corporate; or
(b) a Land Council refuses under subsection 28B(4), or is taken to have refused
under subsection 28B(6), to vary a delegation to
a body corporate;
the body may:
(c) send a copy of the application concerned to the Minister; and
(d) request the Minister, in writing, to decide it is appropriate for the
Council to make the delegation, or the variation to the
delegation, sought by
the body (as the case requires).
(2) The Minister must, by
notice in writing, approve or refuse the request.
(3) The Minister must not approve the request unless he or she is satisfied
that the body will be able to satisfactorily perform the
functions and exercise
the powers sought by the body.
Minister may seek Council’s assistance
(4) In deciding whether to approve or refuse the request, the Minister may,
by notice in writing, require the Council to:
(a) give specified information to the Minister; or
(b) make specified reports available to the Minister; or
(c) provide specified assistance to the Minister.
The Council
must comply with any such requirement.
Consultation
(5) In deciding whether to approve or refuse the request, the Minister must
consult the Council. The Minister may also consult such
other persons or bodies
as the Minister thinks appropriate.
