City of Melville Residents and Ratepayers Association Inc and Department of
Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries
[2024] WAICmr
Date of Decision: 27 June 2024
Information Act 1992
December 2022, the City of Melville Residents and Ratepayers Association
the complainant
applied to the Department of
Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries (
) under the
Freedom of Information Act 1992
the FOI Act
access to two categories of documents. By Part 1 of the access application, the
complainant sought all records associated with
a particular meeting in September
2022 between the agency and the City of Melville (
). By Part 2
of the access application, the complainant sought records between the agency,
the City, the Minister for Local Government
the Minister
) and other
State Government agencies relating to the complainant’s communications
with the agency and the Minister about various
matters associated with the City
since January 2021 ‘or any other related matter mentioned in the
communications be they current
or past matters’.
By notice of
decision dated 14 February 2023, the agency decided to refuse to deal with the
complainant’s access application
under section 20 of the FOI Act
On 16 March 2023, the complainant sought internal
review of the agency’s decision. In its internal review decision, the
referred to the two parts of the complainant’s access application.
In relation to Part 1, the agency decided to give access
to edited copies of
three documents. In relation to Part 2, the agency confirmed its decision under
section 20 to refuse to deal
with that part of the access application.
On 13 April 2023, the complainant applied to the Information
Commissioner (
the Commissioner
) for external review of the agency’s
decision to refuse to deal with Part 2 of the complainant’s access
application.
The complainant also claimed that there were further documents
within the scope of Part 1 of its access application. That was,
in effect, a
claim that the agency had refused the complainant access to documents under
section 26 of the FOI Act (
The Commissioner
obtained the agency’s FOI file maintained in respect of the access
application.
After considering the material then before the Commissioner,
one of the Commissioner’s officers advised the complainant of her
assessment of the agency’s decisions. It was the officer’s
assessment that the agency’s decisions under sections
20 and 26 were
justified. The complainant did not accept the officer’s assessments and
made further submissions.
The Commissioner reviewed all of the material
before her and agreed with her officer’s assessment.
The agency identified approximately 900 documents,
comprising 3500 pages, as potentially coming within the scope of Part 2 of the
access application.
The Commissioner noted that Part 2 of the access
application was very broad and that, based on its wording, it was not surprising
that an extensive amount of documents would come within its scope.
Commissioner was satisfied that the agency had taken reasonable steps to assist
the complainant to change its access application
to reduce the amount of work
needed to deal with it, as required by section 20(1). The agency had provided
suggestions on at least
seven occasions on how the scope of the application
could be reduced to a manageable level. Those suggestions included limiting
requested documents to specific document types, such as meeting or file notes;
limiting the specific parties named in the documents;
and identifying a certain
event, occurrence or project.
Having regard to the substantial number of
documents identified by the agency as potentially coming within the scope of the
application,
the Commissioner accepted that it would be a significant task for
the agency to examine 3500 pages to assess whether each document
comes within
the scope of the application, in the first instance, and then to examine each
document to determine whether any of the
exemptions in Schedule 1 to the FOI Act
apply to any or all of the documents.
As the complainant excluded
personal information from the scope of its application, the agency was not
required to consult with third
parties under section 32 of the FOI Act about the
disclosure of their personal information in the requested documents. However,
as the requested documents were likely to contain an extensive amount of
personal information (including personal information about
officers of the
agency and officers of other agencies), there would still be a significant
amount of work involved in editing the
documents to delete personal information.
Accordingly, based on all of the material before her, the Commissioner
was satisfied that the work involved in dealing with the complainant’s
access application would divert a substantial and unreasonable portion of the
agency’s resources away from its other operations,
pursuant to section
Section 26 provides that an agency may
refuse access to a document if all reasonable steps have been taken to locate
the document,
and it is satisfied that the document is either in the
agency’s possession but cannot be found, or does not exist.
Commissioner considers that, in dealing with section 26, the following questions
must be answered. First, whether there are reasonable
grounds to believe that
the requested documents exist or should exist and are, or should be, held by the
agency. Where those questions
are answered in the affirmative, the next
question is whether the agency has taken all reasonable steps to find those
The Commissioner observed that an agency’s decision to
refuse access to documents under section 26 will be justified, even where
are reasonable grounds to believe further documents exist or should exist, if
the agency has taken all reasonable steps to
find the documents.
agency advised that the officers who attended the meeting in question confirmed
that the meeting was an informal discussion and
that an agenda for the meeting
was not created and no minutes or notes of the meeting were created.
The Commissioner accepted that there were reasonable grounds to believe
that further documents within the scope of Part 1 of the complainant’s
access application should exist. Even if the purpose of the meeting in question
between the agency and the City was an informal
discussion, the Commissioner
considered it was reasonable to expect that, at the very least, a basic record
would have been created
to capture the outcome of the meeting and the key points
discussed, in accordance with the agency’s obligations under the
Records Act 2000
). The Commissioner noted that good
record-keeping underpins the right of access to documents under the FOI Act.
Having regard to the searches and inquiries undertaken by the agency in
this matter, the Commissioner was satisfied that the agency
had taken all
reasonable steps in the circumstances to find the documents within the scope of
Part 1 of the complainant’s access
application and that further documents
either cannot be found or do not exist.
Accordingly, the Commissioner
confirmed the agency’s decision to refuse the complainant access to
documents under section 26
of the FOI Act.
In addition, the Commissioner
confirmed the agency’s decision to refuse to deal with Part 2 of the
complainant’s access
application under section 20 of the FOI
