Chairperson Clues
REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
1. An application has been filed on behalf of the
applicant (Baden Campbell, by his legal guardian Bernice Campbell) pursuant to
Motor Accidents (Liabilities and Compensation) Act 1973
The applicant alleges he is a person aggrieved by a determination of the Motor
Accidents Insurance Board (the Board) not
to make payments by way of scheduled
benefits to him.
2. The reason for the refusal or failure of the Board to
make payments of scheduled benefits to the applicant is that in breach of
r10(2)(a) of the Motor Accidents (Liabilities and Compensation) Regulations 2020
(the Regulations) the applicant did not, within
one year after the date of the
subject motor vehicle accident that occurred on 6 January 2020, give to the
Board notice of personal
injury giving rise to a claim for scheduled benefits.
Therefore it was necessary for the applicant to make an application to the
Tribunal to extend the period of time to give to the Board written notice of
personal injury giving rise to a claim for scheduled
benefits (see
Consideration
3. The principles to be applied in the exercise of the
discretion whether or not to extend time under this regulation are whether
is an acceptable explanation for the delay, whether the applicant has an
arguable case and whether the Board has suffered prejudice
as a result of the
4. In this application the Board concedes that none of these criteria
are in issue.
5. In support of the application the parties have filed signed
joint submissions together with the applicant’s claim for scheduled
benefits and the Tasmania Police crash report.
6. In relation to the issue of
whether the applicant has an acceptable explanation for the delay I take into
account the following
submissions:
• The applicant sustained psychological injuries as a
result of the motor vehicle accident.
• The applicant’s father
died in the motor vehicle accident.
• The applicant remains in the care
of his mother (his legal guardian) who as a result of her own injuries suffered
in the motor
vehicle accident as well as intense grief, overlooked providing
written notice of the applicant’s personal injury within one
year of the
date of the motor vehicle accident.
• The Board accepts that the
applicant has a reasonable explanation for delay.
7. In relation to whether the applicant has a reasonably
arguable case, I take into account the Board’s admission that the
sustained psychological injuries arising directly from the motor
vehicle accident.
8. In relation to prejudice, I take into account the fact
that the Board agrees it has suffered no prejudice as a result of the failure
give notice within the prescribed time.
Determination
9. For the reasons outlined above and having considered the
signed joint submissions and the documents filed in support, I am satisfied
it would be just to extend the time for the applicant to give to the Board
written notice of the personal injury giving rise
to the claim for scheduled
benefits to 18 March 2021 being the date that the claim for scheduled benefits
was received by the Board
(according to the date stamp on that
application).
