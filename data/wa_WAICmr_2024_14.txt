Wong and Department of Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries, Re [2024] WAICmr 14 (30 October 2024)
Decision D0142024 – Published in note form only
Wong and Department of Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries
Date of Decision: 30 October
Freedom of Information Act 1992
1, clause 8(2)
On 1 September 2022, Mr
Stephen Wong (
the complainant
applied to the Department of Local
Government, Sport and Cultural Industries (
) under the
Freedom of Information Act 1992
the FOI Act
access to documents relating to the data for the weigh-in weights for
competitors in combat sports, including the secondary
By notice of decision dated 13 October 2022, the agency decided
to give the complainant access to edited copies of two documents (
disputed documents)
deleting information under clauses 3(1) and 5(1)(e) of
Schedule 1 to the FOI Act. The agency claimed the deleted information was
exempt under clause 3(1) because it was personal information about people other
than the complainant; and under clause 5(1)(e), because
the agency considered
that disclosure of the deleted information could reasonably be expected to
endanger the life or physical safety
of any person.
The complainant
sought internal review of the agency’s decision to delete the secondary
weigh-in weights of each individual
competitor (
the disputed information
on the ground that information was exempt under clause 5(1)(e). By internal
review decision dated 7 November 2022, the agency confirmed
its initial
On 15 November 2022, the complainant applied to the Information
Commissioner (
the Commissioner
) for external review of the
agency’s decision. The Commissioner obtained the disputed documents from
the agency, together
with the FOI file maintained by the agency in respect of
the access application.
The Commissioner’s office made inquiries
with the agency, obtaining further information. As a result of those inquiries,
agency withdrew its claim for exemption under clause 5(1)(e). However, the
agency instead claimed that the disputed information
is exempt under clauses
3(1), 8(1), 8(2) and 10(4) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act.
On 20 June 2024,
one of the Commissioner’s officers provided the parties with their
assessment of the matter. It was the officer’s
assessment that the
Commissioner was likely to be of the view, based on the information before her,
that the disputed information
is exempt under clause 8(2) of Schedule 1 to the
clause 8(2)
complainant did not accept the officer’s assessment and provided further
submissions. The Commissioner reviewed all the
material before her and agreed
with her officer’s assessment.
The complainant submitted that it
was not possible to identify individual competitors by the disclosure of the
disputed information,
being the second weigh-in weight of an individual
competitor. The complainant also submitted that, as individual competitors
disclose their official weigh-in weights to the ‘world at
large’, disclosure of the disputed information would not impact
ability to obtain such information in the future.
In summary, the agency
submitted the disputed information was obtained in confidence, pursuant to an
assurance it would be kept in
confidence, and disclosing the disputed
information would have a chilling effect on information of that kind being able
to be collected
in the future. The agency also submitted, in effect, that given
the disputed information was collected for the purpose of understanding
deterring the dangerous practice of ‘weight cutting’ in combat
sports, it was not in the public interest for people
to be deterred from
providing information of that kind to an agency.
Clause 8, insofar as it
is relevant, provides as follows:
(2) Matter is exempt matter if its disclosure –
(a) would reveal information of a confidential nature obtained in confidence;
(b) could reasonably be expected to prejudice the future supply of information
of that kind to the Government or to an agency.
(4) Matter is not exempt matter under subclause (2) if its disclosure would,
on balance, be in the public interest.
Clause 8(2)(a)
Information is inherently confidential if it
is not in the public domain:
Re Read and Public Service Commission
. To have been ‘obtained in confidence’, the
disputed information must have been both given and received on the basis
either an express or implied understanding of confidence:
Re Kimberley
Diamond Company NL and Department for Resources Development and Another
[2000] WAICmr 51.
From her examination of the disputed documents,
the Commissioner was satisfied the disputed information comprised the weights of
competitors
prior to combat sports competitions and that this information was
inherently confidential. The Commissioner also accepted the agency’s
submissions that competitors were given an assurance of confidence prior to
agreeing to provide the disputed information. The Commissioner
was therefore
satisfied that disclosure of the disputed information would reveal confidential
information obtained in confidence.
Clause 8(2)(b)
Commissioner then considered whether disclosure of the disputed information
could reasonably be expected to prejudice the future
supply of information of
that kind to the Government or the agency.
The Commissioner observed
that the phrase ‘could reasonably be expected to prejudice the future
supply of information of that
kind to the Government or to an agency’
applies not to whether, in this case, competitors could reasonably be expected
to supply secondary weigh-in weights in the future but to whether
disclosure could reasonably be expected generally to prejudice
the future supply
of such information to the Government or to an agency:
Re Apache Northwest
Pty Ltd and Department of Mines and Petroleum and Anor
[2010] WAICmr 35
Gahan v City of Stirling, Re
[1994] WAICmr 19
Commissioner accepted that the collection of the disputed information is
inherently sensitive and that contestants may be reluctant
to provide secondary
weigh-in data if they were not confident it would be kept confidential. After
examining all of the information
before her, the Commissioner accepted that the
future supply of similarly sensitive information, particularly where the
information
can only be obtained by voluntary supply, would be compromised by
the disclosure of the disputed information. The Commissioner was
satisfied that disclosure of the disputed information could reasonably be
expected generally to prejudice the future supply
of such information to the
Government or to an agency.
Clause 8(4)
The Commissioner
then considered the limit on the exemption in clause 8(4), which provides matter
is not exempt under clause 8(2)
if its disclosure would, on balance, be in the
public interest. Under section 102(3) of the FOI Act, the onus was on the
complainant,
as the access applicant, to establish that disclosure of the
disputed information would, on balance, be in the public
well established that disclosure of information under the FOI Act is disclosure
to the world at large as no restrictions or
conditions can be placed upon the
release of documents under the FOI Act: see
Public Transport Authority
[2018] WASC 47
. Accordingly, when considering whether or not to
disclose documents under the FOI Act, the effects of disclosure are generally
as though disclosure were to the world at large, rather than only to
the particular access applicant.
In favour of disclosure, the Commissioner recognised
the public interest in the accountability of agencies for the manner in which
they discharge their functions and obligations. The Commissioner also
recognised public interests in the actions and decisions of
agencies being as
transparent as possible and in the public having confidence that agencies
properly perform their functions including,
in this case, regulatory functions.
Weighing against disclosure, the Commissioner recognised there is a
public interest in upholding agencies’ assurances of confidentiality,
they are reasonably and properly made. The Commissioner also considered there
is a public interest in agencies being able to
collect sensitive information in
a confidential manner, including where that may only be done voluntarily and
particularly where
the purpose of collection is to use that information to
address issues of health and safety.
In balancing the competing public
interests for and against disclosure, the Commissioner was not persuaded that
disclosure of the
disputed information would, on balance, be in the public
interest and found that the limit on the exemption in clause 8(4) did not
Accordingly, the Commissioner found that the disputed information is
exempt under clause 8(2) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act and varied
agency’s decision. In light of that finding, it was not necessary for the
Commissioner to consider whether the disputed
information is also exempt under
any of the other exemption clauses claimed by the agency and she did not do
