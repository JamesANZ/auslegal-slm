APPLICATION FOR A HOTEL LICENCE
Section 51(1)
The applicant
CRYSTALCORP DEVELOPMENTS PTY LTD
applied for a
for premises at the
COPPER COVE MARINA RESORT
WALLAROO 5556
on 28 September 2000. The application was accompanied by
attachment 1
This application has had a chequered history which is well documented in
exhibit 1, provided by Mr Firth for the applicant. Mr Costello
objectors did not dispute this historical record.
On 20 March 2002 the applicant’s solicitor advised that the applicant
sought to amend the application by substituting new plans,
exhibit 2. On 10 May
2002 I directed the applicant to lodge new plans and to provide a copy to
Wallmans, solicitors for the objectors.
I adjourned the matter to 31 May 2002
to give the parties the opportunity to argue whether further planning consent
was required.
On 31 May 2002 I directed readvertising because of the time which had elapsed
between the lodgement of the application with the original
plans and the
lodgement of the substituted plans. My reason for doing so was to give people
who may not have lived in the area or
who may not have had an interest in the
matter in September 2000 an opportunity to be heard on the amended proposal. In
I tacitly allowed the applicant to vary the application by
substituting new plans but unfortunately I omitted to make a formal order
allowing the substitution. Neither party objected to my direction.
I and the applicant (as submitted at this hearing) proceeded on the basis
that I had admitted the substituted plans. The objectors
did not oppose
readvertising and did not argue that I was in error in directing readvertising.
I proceeded on the understanding
that the parties agreed that this was an
approved variation to the application. This now proves not to be the case.
Mr Costello submits that I must either allow or disallow the application to
vary the original application by substituting new plans.
I agree. Mr Firth
concedes that while he believes the parties accepted that I had done so by
directing readvertising, I did not
formally allow the application. Mr Firth now
makes that application for substitution of plans.
Mr Costello submits that I should not allow the substitution because the new
plans represent a totally new concept and constitute
a new application. In
making this submission Mr Costello argues that the principals set in Grand
Hotels (SA) Pty Ltd
[2002] SASC 51
decision of Doyle C J apply in this
In particular, Mr Costello points to
“the only potential limit I can
see is that the variation cannot be one which would fundamentally alter or
perhaps one could
say radically change, the nature of the proposal.”
Mr Costello submits that this is so in this case, that is the substituted plans
reflect such a departure from the original proposal
that I must disallow the
application.
Is Grand Hotels (SA) Pty Ltd & Anor v Holdfast Shores Hotel Services Pty
Ltd relevant to this matter? That involved an application
to vary the plans
which had been approved by the Licensing Court on the grant of a certificate.
That is the application for the
grant of a hotel licence had been granted on the
basis of the plans lodged with the application and the applicant then sought to
vary them after the certificate had been granted. In those circumstances,
persons who did not object to the original application,
based on the original
plans, were not party to the proceedings and therefore had no opportunity to be
heard on what may have constituted
a radical departure form the original
application. Those persons may well have objected to the original application
if the substituted
plans were known at that time.
Mr Firth argues that Holdfast Shores dealt with a totally different set of
circumstances, Holdfast Shores dealt with
section 59(3)(b)(ii)
of the Act which
provides that:
(b) the holder of the certificate satisfies the licensing
(ii) that the premises have been completed in accordance with plans
approved by the licensing authority on the grant of the certificate
variation of those plans later approved by the licensing authority,
a licence conferring the trading rights, and subject to the conditions,
specified in the certificate must be granted to the holder
of the certificate in
respect of the premises.”
whereas here we have an application under
section 51(3)
of the Act which
provides that
“a licensing authority may allow an applicant to vary the
application at any time before the application is decided.”
I agree with Mr Firth’s argument that Holdfast Shores is not a relevant
precedent. It dealt with a post decision substitution
whereas here we have a
pre decision substitution. It has been common practice in this jurisdiction to
allow the substitution of
plans prior to a matter being determined and I do not
see Holdfast Shores as preventing this.
In this case I have ensured that no-one is disadvantaged by directing
readvertising. The only party which could be disadvantaged
would be the
applicant if I disallowed the substitution because the applicant would then have
to lodge a fresh application but in
doing so could not lodge a new application
for a gaming machine licence because of the gaming machine freeze provision of
Machines Act 1997, section 14A.
Mr Costello also referred to two planning decisions: the decision of Jacobs J
- Hancock Development Corporation Pty Ltd v Corporation
of the City of Tea Tree
Gully and Others and to the decision of Wells J - The Corporation of the City of
Marion v Lady Becker, Director
of Planning and State Planning Authority. Both
cases deal with the substitution of plans after the initial decision had been
that is during the appeal process and to that extent differ to this
matter. They are more akin to the Holdfast Shores decision in
that the original
decision had already been made on the basis of other plans. That is not the
In my opinion there is no reason to disallow this application. To do so
would substantially prejudice the applicant but to allow
it does not
disadvantage any party.
If I am wrong in discounting Holdfast Shores I have also considered whether
the substituted plans constitute “
fundamentally alter
radically change, the nature of the proposal
”. In doing so
I have examined both sets of plans. There is no doubt that there has been a
significant reduction in area and
the proposed premises have been relocated on
the subject land.
The proposed premises have gone from a resort style facility with a capacity
of 2435 persons, with 50 accommodation units to a marina
tavern with a capacity
of 730 and 20 accommodation units. The most significant changes being the
removal of the swimming pool facility,
floating pontoon and function area. In
capacity terms these functions alone account for a reduction of 1225 persons.
change of note is the introduction in the substituted plans of a drive
through facility.
The new facility is one level with accommodation units in a separate 3 story
building whereas the original plan was for a single two
story building.
The substituted plans represent a significant scaling down. With the
exemption of the pontoon, swimming pool and function facility,
the proposed
premise will provide all the facilities of the original but on a lesser scale.
This is reflected in Mr Firth’s
advice that the original proposal would
cost $2 to $3 million more than the scaled down tavern.
If I am wrong in discounting Holdfast Shores I would find that the charges
represent a radical change to the nature of the proposal.
However, for the reasons already given I allow the applicant to vary the
application by substituting the new plans, exhibit 2.
