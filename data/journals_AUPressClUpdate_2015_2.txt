Professor Weisbrot

five years in the position.
“I am very excited to be joining the Press Council as its Chair, and
look forward to working closely with the publishers of
print and online media as
well as with the public members,” Prof Weisbrot said. “In recent
years, the Council has taken
great steps to modernise its principles, standards
and procedures; expand its reach to cover the leading digital-only publishers;
and recruit outstanding members and staff.”
“Nevertheless, there will be no shortage of challenges facing the
Council and the industry in coming years. These include preserving

Social Sciences at the University of Sydney, responsible
for the faculties of

“We will continually need to monitor the Council’s standards and
processes to ensure that they are well-adapted for emerging
and converging
information and communications technology,” Prof Weisbrot said. “And
we will need to ensure the community’s
continued confidence in the
Council, as this is a key factor in upholding high standards and accountability
in the media, which critically
underpin the current system of
self-regulation.”
Prof Weisbrot grew up in the United States and moved to Australia in 1979,
after nearly five years working in the Pacific Islands,

the law in the areas of law reform, education and access
