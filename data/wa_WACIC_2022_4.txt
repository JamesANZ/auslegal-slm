for Decision
17 January 2019 the applicant, "H", a police officer, lodged an application
in relation to an incident which took place at Queen
Victoria Street, Fremantle
on 10 February 2016. As a consequence of that incident the offender, "I",
was charged and convicted in
the Magistrates Court at Fremantle on 19 July
2016 with obstructing a public officer and disorderly behaviour in public (the
As the offender was convicted of those offences the application was
made pursuant to
Criminal Injuries Compensation Act
applicant provided a detailed victim impact statement which in addition to
describing the impact of the incident upon the applicant,
set out the
circumstances of the offences. He also provided photographs of the scene of the
offences. I will return to a description
of those photographs below as they are
critical to the circumstances of this incident.
obtained the police brief which contained a copy of the statement of material
facts in relation to the prosecution of the offender.
I summarise the events
leading to the offences as follows. At about 8:52 pm on Saturday,
10 February 2016, the offender was at
a unit in a block of apartments in
Queen Victoria Street, Fremantle. Police attended the Queen Victoria Street
address because they
had been alerted to a dispute between the offender and his
neighbours. Upon arrival police noted the offender yelling obscenities
balcony of his apartment at such a volume he could clearly be heard outside the
building in the courtyard area of the apartment
block. Because of the noise,
several tenants from other apartments were present to observe what was taking
place. Police warned
the offender to stop his behaviour, however the offender
continued shouting obscenities in a loud clear voice. Whilst shouting
obscenities
the offender threw several objects from his balcony including a
mobile phone, a pot plant and drink cans. One of these objects and
applicant in the head, although he suffered no apparent physical injuries at
that time. The offender's behaviour continued
until approximately 10:00 pm
when police gained entry to the offender's property and were able to arrest him.
He was then conveyed
to Fiona Stanley Hospital for a mental health assessment
and was released the following day. The offender was initially charged
disorderly behaviour in a public place and assaulting a public officer.
However, after the offender's solicitor negotiated
with police the charge of
assaulting a public officer was amended to obstructing a police officer.
Following the amendment to the
charges the offender pleaded guilty to both
charges and was convicted in the Magistrates Court of disorderly behaviour in
and obstruct public officer receiving a spent conviction. Given the
offenders plea of guilty the above facts were not put in issue.
police brief provided did not include any statements from the police officers
present at the time of the offences, however, the
applicant's victim impact
statement set out in detail the circumstances of his involvement with the
offender. In the applicant's
victim impact statement, he recites he was a
First-Class Constable attached to the Family Violence Unit. On Saturday,
10 February
2016 he was on duty together with Senior Constable "D". In
response to information received they attended at the premises of the
in Queen Victoria Street in Fremantle and conducted enquiries with neighbouring
units. Whilst talking to neighbours the
officers were disturbed by the offender
who was shouting profanities in a loud clear voice. The applicant and
Senior Constable "D"
exited the neighbouring units and approached the
offender's dwelling. As they attempted to engage verbally with the offender, he
began throwing missiles at them. A pot plant smashed narrowly missing the
applicant's head. A phone and drink cans were also thrown
at the applicant, who
had no cover or protection and feared for his safety. He attempted to back away
to avoid being hit by these
missiles which continued to be thrown at him. One
of the objects struck him on the head. It was unclear which object had struck
him from this barrage of items as the area was poorly lit. When struck by the
object he staggered backwards attempting to regain
his composure and seek cover.
Having been struck on the head by an object the applicant felt immediate pain
and discomfort but continued
in his engagement with the offender. He called for
immediate back-up and an additional five police officers and a police dog
shortly thereafter. Those officers brought with them riot shields.
Under orders from the applicant's sergeant, he and other officers
entered the
offender's property with riot shields in hand. At this point the applicant
noticed his head was pounding and he was
uncertain as to what would take place
when inside the offender's premises. The officers burst through the offender's
door and pushed
the offender over with riot shields. He was then placed in
handcuffs and taken to Fiona Stanley Hospital for a mental health
assessment.
a result of the offences the applicant felt he was affected 'both professionally
and in a personal capacity'. He noticed he was
cautious when speaking to people
who were physically positioned above him for fear of being struck by
projectiles. He maintained
larger distances between himself and others. In his
private life he was reclusive. The incident led to a change in his role at
work. He was no longer in a frontline position, having transferred to a largely
administrative role because of the offences. He
lost some shift penalties
because of moving to an administrative role. He did not quantify those losses.
applicant did not provide any medical evidence to support his claim for
compensation. This was unsurprising given the nature
of the injuries described
by the applicant, namely being struck by an object which did not cause any
apparent physical injury. There
is no statutory requirement for an applicant to
provide medical evidence in order for a claim for compensation to be assessed.
sections 18
of the Act) An assessor is empowered to inform
himself or herself as they see fit and must ultimately determine on the evidence
whether an injury has been sustained. In this case I took into account all of
the material on the police brief, together with the
applicant's victim impact
statement and all the material submitted by the applicant.
photographs of the scene provided by the applicant showed a block of apartments
with parking spaces attached. There are several
vehicles parked in allocated
bays and around those vehicles there is detritus, in particular drink cans, a
mobile phone and a plastic
flowerpot which I infer were the items thrown by the
offender at the officers. There appears to be soil from the flowerpot scattered
on the ground. Taking all of this material into account I was satisfied the
applicant had been struck by at least one object and
suffered immediate pain
which he endured through the period of the incident and for some time
thereafter. I was also satisfied he
suffered a form of acute stress reaction to
the incident, both by reason of being struck by the object and by the intensity
circumstances arising from the offender's behaviour.
was some discrepancy between the statement of material facts in the police brief
which asserted the applicant had been struck
by a flowerpot whereas from the
applicant's victim impact statement I discerned there was some uncertainty as to
which item thrown
by the offender had struck the applicant. Again, given the
circumstances of the offence I did not regard this as surprising or consider
much turned on this point. I was satisfied the applicant had been struck by at
least one item which caused him immediate pain and
headache. In addition,
having been struck by an unknown object the applicant understandably considered
he was at further risk of
harm from the offender if more objects were thrown.
was satisfied the applicant's description of the offences and the impact upon
him was enduring for some period beyond the date
of the offences and resulted in
him removing himself from front line police work. There was no evidence the
applicant was medically
unfit to continue in front line police work and this was
therefore not the subject of a claim for loss of earning capacity. However,
his victim impact statement the applicant described the effect of the offences
convinced him to “get off the front line”
as he no longer wished to
put himself in danger. I accept the offences resulted in the applicant making a
rational and reasonable
choice to avoid frontline duties. I considered the
appropriate method of assessment was to take this into account in the assessment
of injury as a global sum. Taking all these matters into account, I awarded the
applicant $7,500 as a global amount. . (

offender was convicted of the offences and a spent conviction was imposed at
sentencing. From the police brief I was satisfied
the offender's behaviour was
aberrant and, in all probability, related to a florid mental health incident. I
did not consider it
was just to impose any recovery order against the offender
of the Act and barred recovery against the offender.
