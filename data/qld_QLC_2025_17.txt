that the true values are $35,000,000 and $39,000,000.

appeals were heard together. Each side called a valuer. The valuers adopt
different methodologies, but as a base, rely
on sales evidence.

few useful comparable sales.

of precise comparisons is one of the reasons why valuation is a matter of

central issue in each appeal is the value of the subject parcels. There are
contests about:
(a) the highest and best use of the subject parcels;
(b) the competing valuation methodologies;
(c) whether a key sale identified by both valuers can be utilised; and
(d) the usefulness of the other sales identified by the valuers.

Kingham P said:
Valuation Act 2010
governs the valuation process, an artificial exercise for
rating and taxation purposes. The site value of improved land is the capital
it might be expected to realise for its unencumbered estate under a bona fide
sale assuming all non-site improvements for the
land had not been made. A bona
fide sale is one on reasonable terms and conditions assuming willing, but not
anxious, buyer and seller;
a reasonable period within which to negotiate the
sale; and reasonable exposure of the property to the market. In considering
terms and conditions, regard must be had to the location and nature
of the land and the state of the market for land of the same
provisions give statutory expression to the test propounded by the High Court in
Spencer v The Commonwealth

prudent purchaser would entertain in purchasing it for the most advantageous
for which it was adapted. That is synonymous with the market value of

appeals of this kind involve a two step process:

grounds against the valuation in the

[20] There is a
risk in supporting the notion of a range of tolerance when considering whether
there is an error in the issued valuation.
The risk is that it creates a higher
hurdle to appealing a valuation issued by the VG. Error becomes more and more
difficult to establish.
Support for the range of tolerance not leading to error
is difficult to find in the terms of the legislation. I prefer the view that
whether there is an error or not depends on the circumstances of each case

quirk of these appeals is that:
(a) each parcel is to be valued separately;
(b) each parcel is to be valued as though it is unimproved;
(c) the neighbouring sites do not have to be imagined to be unimproved;
(d) the existing shopping centre is spread over both parcels, without reference
to lot boundaries (i.e., the supermarket is partly
in 66 Marine Parade and
partly in 80 Marine Parade); and

disagrees in principle that a reduction is required, but says that if the Court
determines that it is required, a 5%
reduction is a satisfactory figure.

colourfully submits that Mr Crawford applying the risk reduction amount is a
point of material distraction and inaccuracy
in his thinking. It says that Mr
Crawford’s approach is not authorised by

of any structural issue preventing
either parcel of land from being developed in and of itself. It says that if it

Corporate submit that the focus ought to be on

side refers to any cases where this situation has been resolved.
Crawford’s approach does, perhaps, import too much negative sentiment. The
risks of cost blowouts and litigation etc
are possible on any site in a built
up, beachfront area. It can be expected that a prospective purchaser would seek
to maximise the
development potential of either of the subject parcels. That is
a situation commonly confronted. It is not such a negative as to
warrant a risk
reduction as Mr Crawford suggests.

problem for the neighbours, not a problem for the parcel of land being valued. A
5% risk reduction
is not required.
Highest and best use

difference is important because it reflects the way in which each side
approaches the development potential of the land.
Pty Ltd v Melbourne City Council
the Victorian Court of Appeal considered the level of precision required in
identifying the highest and best use. The answer is
that it depends on the
[43] Ms Wadley
identifies the highest and best use to be “mixed use sites consisting of
multi-unit residential over a retail/commercial
podium in accordance with the
planning scheme”
[44] Mr Crawford
disagrees sharply. He thinks it “insufficient to merely state” what
Ms Wadley has stated. He says that
“[t]here must be analysis to form an
opinion on the specific highest and best use”. That is slightly ironic for
I will return to.
Crawford’s view of the highest and best use is:
(a) for 66 Marine Parade –
(i) four basement levels of car parking providing a total of 940 car parks being
404 for the retail component and 536 for the residential
(ii) ground floor and first floor similar to the current site improvements;
(iii) two residential towers with a total unit area of 41,875 square metres in
(b) for 80 Marine Parade –
(i) four basement levels of car parking, providing 1,016 car parks being 522
parks for the retail and 494 for the residential;
(ii) ground floor and first floor similar to the current site improvements;
(iii) two residential towers with a total lot area of 48,250 square metres in
[46] Except for
the retail/commercial podium, that is effectively a doubling of the current site
improvements for each parcel. Mr
Crawford considers a third tower on each of the
subject parcels to involve “excessive development risk”

Transcript 3-94, lines 14-46.
Crawford’s highest and best use imagines the current retail on the ground
floor and first floor being replicated. He
thinks that the two levels that
currently sit above that (office and cinema) do not constitute the highest and
[48] Ms Wadley
thinks that the third and fourth levels of the current podium would be part of
the highest and best use – on
the basis that a prudent purchaser would
maximise the potential of the site for retail/commercial.
[49] Each side
forcefully submitted that the approach of the other expert was wrong.
[50] The Bodies
Corporate say Ms Wadley erred by adopting a highest and best use which prevented
her from forming even a tentative
view of the likely development on the subject
[51] The VG says
that Mr Crawford erred by adopting a highest and best use that was so specific
that it could only have been justified
if it had been founded on detailed expert
evidence from a town planner, an architect, a civil engineer, and an urban
economic demand
specialist – none of which is in evidence
. It says that Mr Crawford fills the gaps
in the evidence himself without the relevant expertise to do so. It says the
specificity
created, on Mr Crawford’s evidence, an artificial constraint
on the development potential on the subject properties.
[52] Mr Crawford
was cross-examined about the tests or workings that underpin his view. The
details are not in the JER, as they should
[53] Taking the
upper two levels of the existing podium as an example, paragraph 206 of the JER
records Mr Crawford’s position

tested this but concluded that development does not

unexplained inputs. Mr Crawford’s approach of adopting a demand rate of
1.6 car parks per unit and using that as a
multiplier to work out how many units
could be achieved was opaque. It is not possible to be confident on the evidence
that the figure
ought to be 1.6, rather than 1.4 or some other figure.
[57] There is no
evidence from other relevant experts
In the absence of town planning evidence or evidence about acceptable car
parking rates per developed unit, Mr Crawford gives his
own opinion of that. He
is an experienced witness and may be capable of that. He speaks, though, of
financial feasibility studies,
expected numbers of residential units or expected
gross lettable area of retail. It ranges broadly and without serious explanation
of what underpins it. It makes his evidence of far lesser assistance in this
Crawford’s view is unambitious for the subject land, in two key
(a) it is improbable that each parcel would be limited to two towers apiece.
These are large pieces of land. Mr Crawford dismissed
the idea of a third tower
on the basis that it would not have ocean views (being stuck behind the two
towers and so, blocked). That
too readily gives up on the idea that a third
tower at the rear of each site might have appealing views to the south. It also
readily gives up on the possibility of a design for the front two towers
that are not monolithic rectangular blocks, but rather some
other shape that
might permit ocean views to be obtained through or around them.
(b) the opinion that the development potential is limited by it being
uneconomical to have more than four levels of basement car
parking is difficult
to accept. It is elusively said to be based on experience, rather than a
tangible estimate or calculations.
Mr Crawford offers no cost/benefit analysis
of having more (or fewer) basement levels. In a general sense, it is

to give evidence: Exhibit 1B, Court Book, Tabs
15-16, pp 661-865. The quantity
surveying experts agreed in large part and their evidence is not determinative
understandable to say that digging more basement levels in this location would
be expensive. There is no evidence, however, of what
that expense would be. Or
whether that expense might be offset by, for example, having three rather than
two residential towers above.
To limit the subject land to four storeys of
basement only is to understate the potential of the subject parcels.
Wadley’s highest and best use is very general. The Bodies Corporate submit
that it was so general as to be obtuse. Ms
Wadley suggests that for each subject
parcel the highest and best use could be between one and four towers
[60] The end
conclusion is that Mr Crawford understates the development potential of the
land. It can very likely do better than two
towers per subject parcel. I agree
with Ms Wadley’s opinion that the figure could be as high as four towers
per subject parcel.
It may involve a three or four storey podium. To be as
conservative as Mr Crawford has, is to understate a circumstance that would
affect the land value advantageously – that is, that the subject parcels
are prime development sites with significant town
planning possibility.
[61] It is not
obvious that the vigorous debate about the highest and best use is essential to
resolving the central issue. The debate
matters in a general sense of viewing
the comparable sales in their proper context. It matters when considering the
valuation methodologies
and approaches of the valuers. That said, preferring Ms
Wadley’s approach to the highest and best use does not lead to a
The competing valuation methodologies
valuers utilise different valuation methodologies. There is no one correct
method to use in valuing land
[63] Mr Crawford
uses three methods:
(a) a direct comparison by component method, with the components being:
(i) dollar rate per square metre
residential area, where the rates reached are by way of comparison with sales;
Transcript 3-17, lines 17-18.
Boland v Yates Property
Corporation Pty Ltd
[1999] HCA 64
(1999) 74 ALJR 209
(ii) $rate/m2 of gross floor area/net lettable area
for the non-residential component, where
the rates reached are by way of comparison with comparable sales;
(b) a direct comparison by component with the components being:
(i) value per unit, where the rates reached are by way of comparison with
comparable sales;
(ii) $rate/m2 of GFA/NLA for the non-residential component, where the rates
reached are by way of comparison with comparable sales;
(c) a direct comparison method having regard to sales evidence analysed to
$rate/m2 of site area. This method was reached independently of the direct
comparison by component methods and did not rely on Mr
Crawford’s specific
highest and best use.
[64] Ms Wadley
uses two methods:
(a) a direct comparison with comparable sales on a $rate/m2;
(b) a check method comparing gross sale prices.
[65] The Bodies
Corporate suggest that Ms Wadley ought to use more than one method. They say
that Ms Wadley’s “check method”
is no proper method at all.
They say that method does not recognise all the differences between the
properties and is far too general.
[66] There is no
criticism of Ms Wadley’s use of the direct comparison method.
[67] The VG
suggests that Mr Crawford’s direct comparison by component method is
flawed because it introduces a range of judgments
and assumptions outside of
legitimate valuation judgment, which cannot be proved and which introduce
uncertainty and false precision.
[68] There is
debate about the International Valuation Standards and whether each valuer
approached their task consistent with those
Standards. It would have been
corroborate her main approach.
It is not surprising, though, that she does not
– given the limited information that is available. Consistency (or
with the International
Valuation Standards is not a determinative factor in the assessment of either
valuer’s evidence.
[69] Identifying
the appropriate valuation method will depend on the available evidence
[70] The direct
comparison by component method risks giving the unwarranted appearance of
mathematical precision to the exercise.
Mr Crawford sets out his use of those
methods carefully at paragraphs 691 and 692 of the JER. In this case, the inputs
methods are too opaque to allow confidence in them.
[71] The Bodies
Corporate are correct that Ms Wadley’s check method is so general as to be
of limited assistance.
[72] On the
evidence, the direct comparison with comparable sales method using dollar per
square metre, is the most helpful. There
are sales to use – albeit with
some limitations outlined below.
Assessment of the evidence of the valuers
side submits that the Court should prefer the evidence of their valuer because
of some error in approach of the other valuer.
Those submissions refer to the
demeanour of the witnesses or the way in which each responded to
cross-examination.
[74] Both Mr
Crawford and Ms Wadley genuinely attempted to assist the Court. Each
demonstrated independence. It is unnecessary to
resort to assessments of
demeanour. Here, the appeals can be resolved by the intrinsic merit (or
otherwise) of the evidence
[75] The Bodies
Corporate submit that Mr Crawford’s valuation methodology does not
collapse entirely if he is wrong about the
highest and best use. I agree. His
dollars per square metre rate method does not rely on his view about the highest
and best use.
That dollars per square metre rate method is a helpful input into
the valuation exercise.
[76] This is not
a case where one of the valuers has made an error or taken an approach which
makes their evidence inutile. Each of
them make helpful contributions when
analysing the comparable sales. Each of them produce figures which can be
brought together to
analyse the value of the subject parcels.

[79] It is quite
nearby to the subject parcels. It is on an elevated headland. A road and a park
separates it from the ocean. There
is no beach at the elevated level of the
land. The parties disagree about the views it has and the advantages it
different to the subject parcels because while it is also
“oceanfront”, that occurs in a quite different context
outside of the commercial hub of Coolangatta and, instead, in a residential
context. The parties disagree about whether that
makes it inferior or superior

cinema and supermarket nearby is a positive or a

parcels offer double the building height and double the development density to
what is available on the Sale 1 land
– and the capacity for retail and
commercial uses.
The question of whether Sale 1 should be
[82] Sitting
above questions of how comparable it is, is the bigger question of whether it
ought to be disregarded.
[83] Mr Crawford
says that no reliance should be placed on it. Ms Wadley rejects the idea that it
is tainted and continues to rely
on it as a primary sale.
[84] The base
legal principle is that for a sale to be useful, it ought to be at arm’s
length, unaffected by special circumstances
. The disagreement here is whether the 14
January 2022 transaction was at arm’s length.

with the issue.
[86] The vendor
was Sunland Greenmount Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Sunland Ltd. The purchaser was
Arium Group Pty Ltd – a company
owned by a group of people, some of whom
were directors of Sunland Ltd
went to great lengths to examine whether the sale was fair or reasonable (or
represented market value). It commissioned
an independent expert report from an
accounting/audit firm (Grant Thornton) to determine whether the sale was fair or
(or represented market value)
. Grant Thornton commissioned an
independent valuation by Herron Todd White (“HTW”). Those
independent reports were commissioned
to satisfy ASIC Regulatory guidelines
[87] Of the HTW
valuation, only the abstract is available – not the whole document. The
abstract shows the “market value”
assessed as $40,000,000
[88] The Grant
Thornton report gives details of the sale process. Arium initially
$41,500,000. It later increased that bid to $42,300,000. Of particular interest
is the detail given about the other bids. There were
recorded to be four
shortlisted bidders, at various amounts (ranging from $37 million to $42
million) and subject to various conditions.
Arium’s offer was higher than
the other offers.
Thornton sets out details of Sunland’s evaluation of the other bids.
Amidst a number of observations about that is
the statement: “... [a]
number of bidders were unknown to both Sunland and the Agent and were assessed
to carry significant
execution and settlement risks”

have no additional detail of the competing bids. They rely on what is in the
Grant Thornton report.

argument here is not whether the purchasers obtained the land cheaply. It is
whether it was truly a competitive process.
[94] The Bodies
Corporate submit that while the independent report process may have ensured that
the sale transacted at a price which
market value, it did
not ensure that the sale transacted
market value. They say
Thornton and HTW had far more information about the sale than is before the
Court, including the Put and Call Option Agreement
and (likely) the underbids,
and they did not consider $42.3M to be market value. Grant Thornton determined
that the market value
of the sale property was $40m, not the sale price of
$42.3m. This was based on an “Abstract of Valuation Report” by HTW.
A complete valuation report is not available. Neither valuer places weight on a
HTW report as evidence of value. HTW itself said
that its valuation should be
regarded with a higher degree of caution than would normally be the case, given
the absence of market
although having regard to the Put and Call Option, did not adopt the contract
price as market value.
Crawford considered the fact that the underbids were from arm’s length

was evidence that
$42.3M was not market value.
information is not before the Court including the Put and Call Option Agreement
and the underbids, which might allow the
Court and valuers to test the sale.
(citations omitted)
[95] The VG
submits that the independent report process demonstrates that the sale was,
effectively, at arm’s length. It says:
(a) there was an extensive marketing campaign which yielded seven bids –
four of which were shortlisted – ranging from
$29 million to $50 million
(those bids being subject to various conditions);
(b) Sunland established an Independent Board Committee and obtained the Grant
Thornton report;
(c) the Independent Board Committee and Grant Thornton both concluded the
transaction was fair and recommended to shareholders that
they vote in favour of
Exhibit 17, Appellants’ Closing
Submissions filed 1 April 2025 (“Exhibit 17”) at [63].
(d) Grant Thornton relied on the idea that Arium had offered a 5.7% premium over
the market value as assessed by HTW;
(e) the Grant Thornton report was brought about because of ASIC Regulatory Guide
111 which provides that a transaction is fair when
the value of the financial
benefit being offered by the company to the related party is equal to or less
than the value of the assets
being acquired.
[96] The VG
cites texts and cases as examples of instances where sales have been challenged
but brought to account in the Court’s
. Those cases turn on their own facts. The
context is essential.
[97] Here, the
context is not fully known. The Sunland process looks rigorous and was, no
doubt, conducted in good faith and with
proper purpose. The gap is between what
Sunland, Grant Thornton and Herron Todd White knew and what the Court knows. It
subjective judgments and unknowns that do not demonstrate that the sale
was a truly competitive process.
[98] I agree
with the Bodies Corporate that the extensive process of obtaining independent
reports did not remove the advantage enjoyed
by the related party purchaser
. It is, therefore, not a sale that should
be relied on to derive the value of the subject
Conclusion about Sale 1
[99] The sale 1
situation is complex and finely balanced. Each of the competing arguments is
clearly arguable. In my view, the evidence
supports the conclusion that the sale
was not at arm’s length.
[100] The Bodies
Corporate submit that Ms Wadley misunderstands the situation with sale 1 and by
relying on it, undermines the reliability
of her valuation more generally. I
disagree. Ms Wadley did not make a glaring or obvious error that reflects
negatively on her overall
Summary of the analysed rates for the sales
Wadley has analysed rates for sales 2 to 9 as follows (along with her
characterisation of the sale):
(a) Sale 2 - $3,026/m2 (secondary);
Exhibit 18, at [32]-[34].
Exhibit 17, at [59].
(b) Sale 3 - $3,427/m2 (not comparable);
(c) Sale 4 - $16,625/m2 (primary);
(d) Sale 5 - $7,294/m2 (primary);
(e) Sale 6 - $7,764/m2 (secondary);
(f) Sale 7 – does not recognise it as being comparable;
(g) Sale 8 - $9,807/m2 (secondary);
(h) Sale 9 - $13,122/m2 (secondary)
Crawford’s version of those figures
(a) Sale 2 - $2,334/m2 (primary);
(b) Sale 3 - $3,331/m2 (primary);
(c) Sale 4 - $15,749/m2 (primary);
(d) Sale 5 - $7,031/m2 (primary);
(e) Sale 6 - $6,396/m2 (primary);
(f) Sale 7 - $391/m2 (primary);
(g) Sale 8 – $9,571/m2
(h) Sale 9 – $13,122/m2
differences are not significant, given that those analysed rates still need to
be scrutinised to work out how comparable
each of those sites is to the each of
the subject parcels. The only sales where it has been necessary to make a
finding as to the
dollar rate per square metre have been Sale 2
) and Sale 6 ($7,000/m
). These are discussed
further below.
[104] Ms Wadley
uses her figures, having regard to the attributes, location and situation of the
subject parcels to adopt a rate of
$5,000 for the subject properties
. For 66 Marine Parade, Ms Wadley adopts
$49,500,000
. For 80 Marine Parade, it
is $55,600,000.

That takes 9,653m2 as being

Crawford utilises his three methods

The nine sales identified by the valuers
Sale 1 is excluded, eight sales remain for consideration. Each valuer has views
they are primary, secondary or of
limited use. The valuers analyse the sales to adjust for improvements or unusual
circumstances.
There is some disagreement about that analysis, but not
valuers agree that no single sale is directly comparable
[108] The modest
adjustments made in the analysis of each sale gives the appearance of scientific
or mathematic rigour to a process
that instead involves matters of judgement and
opinion. The adjustments, for easements or access or something else, play very
(if any) determinative role in reaching a concluded value for the subject
[109] At best,
the adjustments feed into the comparable sales at a point before those sales are
then, effectively, adjusted again
when working out how comparable they are to
the subjects. It is all necessarily imprecise.
[110] The eight
remaining sales show a wide variation in dollar per square metre
[111] Sale 2 is
103 Ferny Avenue, Surfers Paradise. On 12 March 2021 it sold for
$28,000,000. It is 11,480 square metres.

block back from the beach and west of the Surfers Paradise esplanade. It is
several blocks north of the Surfers Paradise
central business district. There is
a light rail stop nearby.

[116] There are
two disagreements about the analysis of the sale – (1) whether the sale
should be adjusted to account for an
alleged payment of rates and land tax by
the purchaser and (2) what to make of the easement.
[117] As to the
first issue, Ms Wadley adjusts the sale price by $1,500,000 to account for an
alleged payment of outstanding rates
and land tax owing on the property. Mr
Crawford makes no adjustment. The evidence about the payment comes from a column
in the Gold
Coast Bulletin that says that “apparently” the payment
was made. It appears to be something like a real estate related
gossip column
. The Bodies Corporate say that there is
no reliable evidence that the payment was made.
[118] Valuers
rely on conversations with agents, conversations with purchasers and an array of
informal information to analyse a sale.
There have been many contests before the
Court about whether particular information should have been relied on. Here, the
Corporate are right – the information supporting the adjustment for
outstanding rates and land tax is too flimsy to support
an adjustment of
$1,500,000.
[119] As to the
second issue, Ms Wadley adjusts the sale by diminishing the size of the land to
account for an easement. Mr Crawford
makes no adjustment for the easement
because he thinks it can be used as a setback or for access. He says if valuing
the land on
a rate per square metre basis, he would apply a 30-40% discount on
the easement area.
[120] There was
evidence of what the purchaser thought of the easement (whether it was a
positive or a negative). That evidence was
insubstantial. The better point is
that the easement could be used for something – whether as a setback or as
an access. Mr
Crawford’s approach of applying a 30-40% discount to the
easement area is preferred.
[121] Sale 2 is
most similar in land size, but much lower in per square metre value.
valuers think the sale is in a superior
to the subject parcels,
but an inferior
being one block back from the beach. That
inferior situation overwhelms any advantage of the sale land being in a superior
The context of the Sale 2 land is substantially less attractive than the
subject site – being located between two substantial
north-south roads and
a significant distance from the beach. There are some views from the sale land
, but it is - across roads - surrounded by
development.
JER, p 317.
Exhibit 12, Paradiso Place Image
Screenshot.
The subject parcels have the advantage of openness across Marine Parade, where
there is no high rise development but simply a park.
[123] Sale 2 is
also not right in the heart of Surfers Paradise, but slightly removed to the
[124] The Bodies
Corporate say that Sale 2 is particularly comparable because it is a similar
size, the restricted views are offset
by an unlimited building height potential
and it is in a superior location. It is difficult to balance the restricted
the building height opportunity, but the Sale 2 land seems
substantially inferior all around compared to the subject parcels.
[125] It is
difficult to reconcile why the Sale 2 land sold at a low dollar per square metre
rate. That may be, in part, because it
is a large piece of land. More
influential than that, though, is its disadvantages. While Sale 2 supports the
view of $4,000 per
square metre for the subject parcels, it is not so comparable
as to be a powerful indicator of that view.
[126] From the
options helpfully set out in the Appellants’ closing submissions filed 1
at paragraph 85, the sale
should be analysed at $2,548 per square metre.
[127] Sale 3 is
31-35 McLean Street, Coolangatta. On 5 May 2021 it sold for $7,900,000. It is
2,355 square metres.
[128] Of all the
sales, it is the nearest in location to the subject parcels. It is a small,
unusual shape. It is constrained by a
heritage building. It is in a Centre
[129] There is
no meaningful difference between the valuers’ analysis of the sale.
[130] Paradoxically,
this land is subject to a 39 metre “limit” in the Building Height
– but has a development approval
for a tower of 18 storeys (58.75 metres).
An application to increase that to 21 storeys (67.7 metres) is on appeal before
the Planning
and Environment Court.
[131] The 18
storey development approval was obtained after the relevant date of valuation
here. The parties say to disregard the
approval. That is right. It ought not
have any role in the valuation analysis. That said, it is quite odd that the
Court is to assume
that the subject parcels would be developed no more
intensively than the Building Height
Exhibit 17.
Overlay map figure, when there is evidence that applicants nearby are achieving
greater heights than the map specifies. Nevertheless,
the approval is no part of
the analysis occurring here.
[132] There is
no meaningful difference between the valuers’ views of the dollars per
square metre rate.
[133] Sale 3 is
difficult to apply. Mr Crawford says that it is a primary sale. It is likely to
be built out on all sides
. That, and
the combination of its smaller size, non- beachfront location and heritage
constraint mean that its comparability to the
subject parcels is negligible. Ms
Wadley considered Sale 3 to be of no assistance. That is
[134] Sale 4 is
3343 Gold Coast Highway, Surfers Paradise. On 12 August 2021 it sold
$75,855,603. It is 4,413 square metres.
[135] It has
unimpeded ocean views (there is a two lane road, but no park, between the land
and the beach). It has two lengthy street
frontages on the east and the
[136] It is in
the High Density Residential zone. It has no building height restrictions.
[137] It is
being developed very intensively. That development will involve nine basement
car parking levels.
valuers consider it a primary sale. It is one of only two properties that they
agree is primary.
[139] Sale 4
involves the valuers reaching similar analysed figures on a dollars per square
metre basis, but differing substantially
[140] While it
is difficult to work out why Sale 2 sold at a low dollar per square metre rate,
it is similarly difficult to account
for why Sale 4 sold at such a high rate. It
must be because it has an excellent location and an excellent aspect.
Crawford thinks Sale 4 to be superior to the subject parcels on the basis of
there being no park between the land and the
ocean, it being in Surfers Paradise
(superior location) and it being close to a light rail station. Ms Wadley thinks
it is slightly
Exhibit 18 at [56].
[142] It is only
zoned for residential but has no building height limit.
[143] It is of
interest that Sale 4 transacted at approximately double the dollar rate per
square metre of Sale 5. As the Bodies Corporate
accept, that demonstrates a
significant premium was paid for esplanade land
[144] It is
markedly superior to the subject parcels. But it reflects the premium paid for
oceanfront land. It supports the $5,000
per square metre view of the subject
parcels, not the $4,000 per square metre view.
[145] Sale 5 is
1 Albert & Victoria Avenue, Broadbeach. On 9 July 2021 it sold for
$58,500,000. It is 4,856 square metres.
[146] It is 250
metres from the ocean, with restricted ocean views. It is in the Centre zone
. It is in an area of unrestricted
building height.
[147] It is
being developed for a mix of residential towers and retail/commercial uses. The
development will involve six basement
car parking levels.
valuation experts both consider it is a primary sale. It is the second and only
other sale they agree is primary.
[149] There is
no meaningful difference between the valuers’ views of the dollars per
square metre rate.
[150] Sale 5 is
in what the valuers say is a slightly more desirable location (Broadbeach versus
Coolangatta), but a materially inferior
location to the subject parcels. It is
comparable in terms of retail potential and other amenity. It has an awkward
shape and internal
position. All of that said, it has an unlimited building
height. It is difficult to weigh those factors for and against. Ms Wadley
suggests that Sale 5 is inferior to the subject parcels principally because of
the oceanfront location and ocean views enjoyed at
the latter. That is
Exhibit 17 at [129].
that it occupies a different position in the Centre Zone code hierarchy –
Broadbeach is a ‘principal centre’
whereas Coolangatta is a
‘major centre’; City of Gold Coast’s Centre Zone code. See
Exhibit 8B, pp 2-3.
Crawford says there is a distinct similarity between Broadbeach and the subject
properties in that they are both zoned Centre
and both incorporate multi-level
retail and commercial below residential towers
[152] Sale 5 is
interesting, though, because at about $7,000 per square metre for inferior land,
it supports a higher value for the
subject parcels. Even noting that Sale 5
could be expected to be at a higher dollar figure per square metre because of
its smaller
size, it is not that small. The sale is helpful in determining the
value of the subject parcels.
[153] Sale 6 is
1293 Gold Coast Highway, Palm Beach. On 11 August 2020 it sold for
$21,000,000. It is 3,234 square metres.
[154] It is
beachfront. It is in a Medium Density Residential zone and has a mapped building
height of 29 metres.
valuers differ about whether adjustment should be made for a seawall setback. Ms
Wadley adjusts the developable area to
2,707 square metres to account for the
setback. She says the seawall setback area has no value because it cannot be
developed. Mr
Crawford disagrees and says it could be landscaped and beautified
to add value.
[156] Really,
the position is somewhere between the two. The easement area is not valueless,
but nor is it making a very valuable
contribution by being a place for
landscaping. The difference between the valuers’ analysis of this sale is
not significant
even with their differences about the easement.
conclusion is that this sale ought to be treated as being approximately $7,000
per square metre.
[158] Sale 6 is
only one third the size of the subject parcels. The Bodies Corporate say that
its location is far superior to the
subject parcels.
[159] The VG
says that Sale 6 is difficult to use to derive the value of the subject parcels
because Sale 6 has absolute beachfront
location, significantly inferior
residential potential and an absence of any retail or commercial
JER, p 368 at [534].
parties agree that it contributes little to the exercise. The VG says it has no
utility at all. Despite that, the Court
is equipped with evidence about it. The
sale gives a broad indication of the premium price commanded by oceanfront
[161] It is more
“oceanfront” than the subject parcels. But it has lesser development
opportunity (residential only; height
limited). The $7,000 per square metre
figure for Sale 6 supports the $5,000 per square metre view of the subject
parcels, not the
$4,000 per square metre view.
[162] Sale 7 is
1 Marina Quays Boulevard, Hope Island. On 28 March 2017 it sold for
$14,300,000. It is 24,810 square metres.
[163] It is in
the Centre zone. Ms Wadley says it has a 33 metre height designation
[164] It is
thoroughly incomparable. It is a great distance from the subject parcels. It is
nowhere near the beach. It sold years
Crawford includes it in the list of sales as his primary evidence for assessing
the site value of the two retail levels of
the subject parcels
. Ms Wadley does not rely on it at all
because she considers that it is not comparable.
[166] The sale
was analysed in a judgment of the Land Appeal Court.
Mr Crawford includes it here partly
because it was analysed by that Court. That is a helpful but futile endeavour,
though, because
the sale is too distant, too long ago and too unlike the subject
parcels to be of any assistance here.
Sales 8 and 9
valuers identified sales at 154-156 Marine Parade, Coolangatta
and 146 Marine Parade, Coolangatta.
The sales were included to complete the
picture of market activity in Coolangatta. Neither side pressed Sales 8 or 9 as
serious role to play in determining the value of the subject
[168] There is
no meaningful difference between the valuers’ views of the dollars per
square metre rate, for either sale.

Eumundi Group Hotels Pty Ltd v
Valuer General
[2021] QLAC 2.
Sold on 30 August 2021 for
$11,886,364. It is 1,194 square metres.
Sold on 18 January 2021 for
$11,500,000. It is 862 square metres.
[169] Sales 8
and 9 are small. There is no dispute that a smaller property will transact at a
higher dollar rate per square metre
than a larger property, all other things
being equal
[170] Sale 9,
while not very comparable, provides an interesting exercise in relativity. The
VG points out that it is one twelfth
the size of the subject parcels but
nonetheless sold for $11.74 million – despite the subject parcels having
double the height
and density potential. That does support the advantage of
esplanade front land in the mind of a prospective purchaser.
[171] Otherwise,
neither of these sales contributes meaningfully to the valuation task.
Using the sales to determine the values
informally, the question is whether the figures at paragraphs
above properly lead to a value of
$4,000 per square metre of land, or $5,000 per square metre.
[173] Numerous
approaches can be used to find the figure. In
YFG Shopping Centres Pty Ltd v
Valuer-General
the Court suggested
(about approaching the valuers evidence):
The correct approach to
valuation is to assign the subject land, by comparison, to its proper place in
the scale of values disclosed
by sales proved. Using the market continuum method
of valuation, the analysed sale rate for the subject site must be somewhere
the worst of the superior sites and the best of the inferior sites.
[174] By analogy
here, the factors that support $5,000 per square metre and the factors that
support $4,000 per square metre is an
exercise in locating the correct value
within the spectrum of the sales.
highest and best use of the subject parcels is a relevant part of comparing
those parcels to the comparable sales. A more
intensive highest and best use
would, obviously enough, be a circumstance that would affect the land value
advantageously.
valuers work out the comparability of the sales by scaling them up or down
depending on the view of comparability. Percentage
figures are used to say, for
example, that Mr Crawford’s $4,000 per square metre figure is 70% in
excess of his applied rate
for Sale 2. The Bodies Corporate say that shows Mr
Crawford must be
Transcript 4-53, lines 8-20.
[20202] QLC 10
right – he has reckoned with the disadvantages of Sale 2 in comparison to
the subjects and reached an appropriately adjusted
Crawford’s $4,000 per square metre figure was derived not just from a one
on one comparison with Sale 2 but with an
overall, judgment and opinion based
exercise with reference to all of the sales. Mr Crawford acted conventionally
and appropriately
in the way he considered it. So did Ms Wadley. It does not
mean that either of their views must be accepted wholesale.
[178] That said,
the sales support Ms Wadley’s figure of $5,000 per square metre, with an
adjustment to deal with the Sale 1
Dealing with the effect
of excluding Sale 1
though Sale 1 is not to be relied on, it is necessary to identify a dollar per
square metre rate for it, to explain how
deducting it from the analysis affects
the conclusion. Mr Crawford has an analysed figure for it of
. Ms Wadley has $6,575/m
. The parties fiercely
contest the comparability of the sale land.
[180] Ms Wadley
says the Sale 1 land is overall inferior because it is in a less desirable
location with substantially inferior views,
no material commercial or retail
potential, only half the height potential and only half the available
Crawford says it is in a superior location. He says it is in a prestigious
residential locality attracting a superior quality
development than would be
appropriate for the subject properties which he considers would be more down
market by comparison.
[182] They are
both partially correct. Ms Wadley’s list of matters making it inferior is
right, although the views are not as
dire as she makes out. Mr Crawford is right
when he says that its elevated headland position gives it a slightly intangible
or premium quality.
[183] Removing
it from the analysis puts downward pressure on the top of the range – ie.
the $5,000 per square metre. Quantifying
the extent of that downward pressure is
difficult, but ought only be slight. I think a deduction of $250 per square
metre is appropriate.
synthesis of Sales 2, 4, 5 and 6, plus the removal of Sale 1 from consideration
leads to $4,750 per square metre.
issued valuations are in error. Ms Wadley ought not have relied on Sale 1. That
required the remaining sales to be synthesised
to reach the values.
[186] There are
serious indicators that oceanfront land commands a value premium over
non-oceanfront land. Sale 2 is the anomaly,
but it is markedly inferior. Sale 3
is sufficiently lacking in comparability to make it difficult to apply. Sales 4,
5 and 6 support
the $5,000 per square metre view over the $4,000 per square
metre view. The overarching impression of the evidence is that the land
be valued at the higher amount. In this case, just under $5,000 per square
metre. Some of the sales are at very high rates
per square metre.
[187] The Bodies
Corporate have done everything that they can to challenge the issued valuations.
Their legal representatives have
comprehensively and tenaciously put forward
every argument in their favour. The difficulty for the Bodies Corporate is that
the highest
and best use of the land and the sales evidence does not support the
lower values that they contend for.
[188] I adopt
$4,750 per square metre. That yields values for the subject parcels
(a) For 80 Marine Parade (Oceans Plaza) $52,820,000; and
(b) For 66 Marine Parade (Points North) $47,040,500
Valuing the easement area of 317
square metres at $3,750 per square metre.
