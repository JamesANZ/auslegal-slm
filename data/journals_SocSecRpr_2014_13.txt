SECRETARY TO THE DSS and LWIN
Formal decision
Baby bonus: whether child 'living with' claimant
SECRETARY TO THE DSS and LWIN
Decided: 29th May 2014 by A.K Britton
The Secretary sought review of a decision of the SSAT, which found that Lwin
was entitled to baby bonus in respect of his daughter
‘H’, during
the period 3 February 2012 to 7 March 2012.
In May 2011, Lwin, married Wai, a resident of Myanmar. Lwin travelled to
Myanmar for H’s birth and remained in Myanmar between
28 January 2012 and
7 March 2012. During the time he spent in Myanmar, Lwin devoted his time to
caring for and supporting his wife
and daughter.
On 7 March 2012, Lwin returned to Australia. His wife and daughter were not
able to return to Australia with him, as the wife did
not have a valid visa. She
and H eventually joined Lwin in Australia in March 2013, and have remained in
Australia ever since. Lwin
contended that H was ‘living with’ him in
the 33 days he spent in Myanmar immediately after her birth. The Secretary
The issue for determination by the AAT was the meaning of the phrase
‘living with’ in
(2) (c) of the
A New Tax System (Family
Assistance) Act 1999
The AAT observed that the SSAT, in its reasons for decision, had noted the
inconsistent approaches taken by the AAT to the interpretation
of the words
‘living with’ in the context of
(2) (c) of the Act. The SSAT in
the present matter had adopted the approach taken in
Saqa and Secretary,
Department of Family and Community Services and Anor
[2006] AATA 439
the words ‘living with’ were construed to mean (at [22])
‘staying with even for a brief period’. The
SSAT reasoned that this
approach should be preferred, as it was consistent with the beneficial nature of
The AAT noted that the SSAT’s decision was made before the decision in
McGee; Secretary, Department of Social Services
[2014] AATA 53
, where the
meaning of the term ‘living with’ was considered. In that case,
Deputy President Handley concluded that the
words ‘living with’ in
(2) (c) indicates that the living arrangement must have a degree of
permanency or, at least, been ongoing at the relevant time.
The AAT in the present matter agreed with the reasoning in
Adopting that approach, the AAT found that it was apparent that, in this case,
the living arrangement lacked the necessary degree
of permanence. While
Lwin’s plan had always been to live with H on a permanent basis in
Australia, he had no intention of living
with her on an ongoing basis while she
was in Myanmar. The AAT found that he travelled to Myanmar on the understanding
that he would
and H would join him once Wai’s visa was granted. The AAT concluded
the 33 days Lwin had spent with H in Myanmar lacked the necessary degree of
permanence, and therefore found that H was not ‘living
with’ Lwin in
that period.
Formal decision
The AAT set aside the decision under review and substituted a decision that
Lwin was not eligible for baby bonus in respect of his
daughter H.
