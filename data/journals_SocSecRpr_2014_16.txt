McHATTIE and SECRETARY TO THE DSS
Decided: 28th April 2014 by A.K Britton
The Secretary conceded that McHattie qualified for disability support pension
(DSP) when he lodged his claim on 23 March 2012 and
that the AAT should set
aside the decision of the SSAT and, in substitution of that decision, decide
that McHattie was qualified
to receive DSP when he lodged his claim. The sole
issue in dispute between the parties was the start date for payment of DSP.
contended that the correct date was the date he made his claim, 23
March 2012 whereas the Secretary contended that the correct date
September 2012, the day McHattie lodged an application for review by the SSAT of
the Authorised Review Officer (ARO’s)
Statutory Framework
Section 43(6) of the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal 1975
AAT Act) deals with the date of the effect of a decision by the AAT and
Tribunal’s decision taken to be the decision of decision maker. A
decision of a person as varied by the Tribunal, or a decision
made by the
Tribunal in substitution for the decision of a person, shall, for all purposes
(other than the purposes of applications
to the Tribunal for a review or of
appeals in accordance with section 44), be deemed to be a decision of that
person and, upon the
coming into operation of the decision of the Tribunal,
unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, has effect, or shall be deemed to have
effect, on and from the day on which the decision under review has or had
Subsections 152(4) and (5) of the
Administration Act
(a) a person is given written notice of a decision under the social security
(b) the person applies to the SSAT more than 13 weeks after the notice was
given for review of the decision; and
(c) the SSAT varies the decision or sets the decision aside and substitutes a
new decision; and
(d) the effect of the decision of the SSAT is:
(i) to grant the person's claim for a social security payment or a concession
(ii) to direct the making of a payment of a social security payment to the
person or the issue of a concession card to the person,
as the case may be;
(iii) to increase the rate of the person's social security payment; the
social security law has effect as if the decision under review
had taken effect
on the day on which the application was made to the SSAT for review of that
(5) The SSAT may declare:
(a) that subsection
(3) does not apply to a decision by the SSAT on a review; and
(b) that subsections (1) and (2) apply instead.
The Secretary contended that in these circumstances consistent with
Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Mitchell
[2006] AATA 804
, s.152 of the
Administration Act
ought be applied and
the date of effect of the AAT’s decision should be taken to be the date
McHattie applied for review of
the decision of the ARO, 18 September 2012, which
was more than 13 weeks after he was notified of the decision of the ARO (23 May
The AAT disagreed with the analysis of DP Jarvis in
s.152(4) of the
Administration Act
operated to deprive the AAT of the
discretion conferred by s.43(6) of the AAT Act to ‘otherwise order’
and to determine
the date of ef-fect of any decision it makes on review. The AAT
noted that s.152 concerns the date of effect of a decision of the
s.43(6) concerns the date of ef-fect of a decision of the AAT. The AAT found
that while a decision of the AAT is deemed
to be a decision of the SSAT, it did
not mean that s.152(4) of the
Ad-ministration Act
governed the date of
the effect of a decision made by the AAT.
Noting that the AAT Act did not provide guidance on the factors that should
be taken into account in deciding whether the power ‘to
order’ should be exercised, having regard to the re-striction on
retrospectivity contained in s.152 of the
Administration Act
absence of any compelling circum-stances justifying a departure from that
restriction, the AAT found that this was not
an appropriate case to
‘otherwise order’ that the date of effect of the de-cision, should
be as McHattie contended, the
date he made his claim for DSP.
Formal decision
The AAT set aside the decision of the SSAT, and in place of that decision,
decided that McHattie was qualified to re-ceive the disability
support pension
when he made his claim for the pension on 23 March 2012.
The date of effect of this decision was 18 September 2012.
