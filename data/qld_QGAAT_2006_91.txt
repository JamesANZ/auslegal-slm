ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY
The Tribunal notes that the
following Enduring Power of Attorney dated 7 October 2002 appointing CP for MLA
is overtaken by the making
of these appointments and, in accordance with Section
22(2) of the Act can no longer be acted upon to the extent that these
appointments
have been made.
REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION
[1] MLA was born on 12 September 1953 and is aged 53 years. MLA is a registered
[2] MLA suffered a severe traumatic brain injury on 2 January 2005 as a result
of a motor cycle accident, which left her with permanent
cognitive and physical
disability and requiring twenty four hour supervision. MLA was a pillion
passenger on the motor cycle being
driven by JT. A personal injuries claim has
been made on MLA’s behalf. Her solicitors expect that the award of damages
that claim will be “substantial”.
[3] At the time of her accident, MLA had been separated from her husband, MW,
for approximately 12 months. She has three adult sons
of that marriage. MLA had
recently purchased her own home in which she was living alone at the time of the
accident. She now resides
at a residential nursing care facility operated by
Queensland Health.
[4] Prior to the accident it is reported that MLA had formed a friendship with
JT. JT now describes himself as MLA’s “partner”,
which her family disputes.
[5] On 14 August 2006 the Tribunal received an application for guardianship and
for administration from four members of MLA’s
family: CP (mother); GM
(sister); RP (brother) and SS (brother’s partner).
[6] CP is also MLA’s attorney for financial and personal/health matters
under an Enduring Power of Attorney dated 7 October
2004 but is seeking the
Tribunal’s leave to resign as attorney upon the making of the orders
sought in relation to guardianship
and administration.
ISSUES AND THE LEGISLATION
[7] The issues for the Tribunal
have capacity for the matter;
need for a Guardian? if so, who should be appointed;
Is there a need for an Administrator?
If so, who should be appointed.
[8] The Tribunal has the power in
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
(the Act) to appoint a Guardian for a personal
matter or an Administrator for a financial matter only if the Tribunal is
as to the following:
(a) the adult has impaired capacity for the matter; and
(b) there is need for a decision in relation to the matter or the adult is
likely to do something in relation to the matter that involves,
or is likely to
involve, unreasonable risk to the adult’s health, welfare or property:
(c) without an appointment-
(i) the adult’s needs will not be adequately met;
(ii) or the adult’s interests will not be adequately
[9] Capacity is defined in schedule 4 of the Act as:
, for a person for a matter, means the
person is capable of-
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
[10] There is a presumption at law that an adult has capacity and section 7 of
the Act sets out that presumption. It is further set
out in the General
Principles in Schedule 1 of the Act.
THE PARTIES
[11] The following parties were present at the hearing:
CP, RP, GM and SS – the applicants
Mr Daryl Smith – applicants’ solicitor
MM – MLA’s son
AM – MLA’s friend
TXJ – Nurse Unit Manager of Nursing Home
TS – Acting Director of Nursing Home
Representative of the Office of the Adult Guardian
Representative of The Public Trustee of Queensland
JT – MLA’s friend
MATERIAL RELIED UPON BY THE
[12] The following written material was considered by the Tribunal in making its
determination:
Application
for Guardianship and Administration and for Leave to Withdraw as
Correspondence from the applicants
enclosing various medical reports, ACAT assessment, Adult Guardian’s
Investigation Report
and background information on the
Correspondence from the
applicants’ solicitors
Correspondence
from JT enclosing statements and statutory declarations from various people
attesting to the relationship between JT
sons, JXT and JT
[13] In addition to this material, all parties at the hearing were given the
opportunity to express their views about the application.
These views where
specifically relied upon by the Tribunal, are discussed
DOES MLA LACK CAPACITY FOR THE MATTER?
[14] In considering the issue of capacity the Tribunal took into account all of
the medical and ancillary evidence which had been
presented to the Tribunal, as
well as the views expressed by those present at the hearing.
Dr Indraine Benedict
stated in a report dated 6 May 2006 provided to
Centrelink that MLA suffered a severe traumatic brain injury on 2 January 2005
caused quadriplegia and severe cognitive and physical disability. Dr
Benedict further stated that MLA required full time nursing
and medical care,
and was bed and wheelchair bound.
[16] Dr Benedict explained that MLA had had several surgical operations
following the initial trauma sustained in a motor cycle accident
which caused
her to be comatose for several weeks. She had improved from that comatose state
to her current level and Dr Benedict
did not expect any further
improvement.
[17] Dr Benedict stated that MLA was receiving ongoing physiotherapy and speech
therapy as well as full nursing care, and required
such as feeding, hygiene, toileting and so on. Dr Benedict also noted that MLA
was rarely compliant
with the recommended treatment.
Ms Simone Cahill
stated in a discharge report (A28.12) that MLA was
inpatient at the Hospital and then at another Hospital until 6 April 2005, when
she was transferred to a Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit (BIRU) where she
remained until she was discharged to a residential nursing
care facility on 9
September 2005.
[19] Ms Cahill noted that MLA’s progress had been very slow whilst in BIRU
and she had not been able to communicate her wishes,
thoughts and feelings to
the team. MLA was noted to be inconsistent with her yes/no answers and she
perseverated. She appeared to
understand information sometimes but was unable to
articulate clearly if that were so.
Dr David Walker
, Neurosurgeon, stated in a report dated 13 June
2006, that MLA had virtually no verbal output which made assessment difficult.
Walker stated in his further report dated 1 September 2006 that he had
reviewed MLA on that date, and he considered her condition
to be worse than when
he had seen her in late 2005. A CT scan showed ventriculomegaly consistent with
communicating hydrocephalus,
and Dr Walker recommended that a VP shunt be placed
so as to relieve the problems. That surgery was subsequently carried out in
Dr Anthony Houston
, Orthopaedic Surgeon, stated in his report dated
16 March 2006 that MLA had spent six weeks in a coma as a result of the accident
on 2 January 2005 and had residual hypertonia in the lower limbs and also had
little ability to communicate.
[22] On 27 January 2006 MLA was assessed by
Ms Sue Campbell
, Occupational
Therapist. In her report dated 30 January 2006, Ms Campbell made the following
assessment of MLA:
MLA was unable to provide any verbal responses during this assessment. She
initially did not respond at all but as the session progressed
she did attempt
to nod yes and no. She pointed to some body parts on command. She brushed her
hair when given a hairbrush. She was
unable to brush her teeth when given a
toothbrush. She was able to write her name, the month when prompted and the
numbers 1 to 4
on request. She was able to draw some shapes eg. Circle, square.
Her writing was small but legible. She perseverated with some
[23] Ms Campbell concluded that MLA had severe communication problems with both
expression and comprehension and also significant
motor planning
[24] None of those present at the hearing who had personal knowledge of
MLA’s circumstances challenged the findings of the
health professionals in
relation to capacity.
[25] The Tribunal was satisfied that MLA sustained a severe traumatic brain
injury in a motor cycle accident on 2 January 2005 as
a result of which she has
severe cognitive and physical disability. The Tribunal was further satisfied
that MLA requires full time
nursing and medical care and is bed and wheelchair
[26] The Tribunal finds that the presumption of capacity has been rebutted by
the medical evidence and the evidence of the other
health care professionals and
therefore further finds that MLA has impaired capacity for decision making in
relation to personal
and financial matters.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN?
[27] MLA is currently residing in residential nursing care facility. Her care
needs are extremely high and the potential for further
intensive rehabilitation
services needs to be addressed, particularly if her prognosis has been improved
by the insertion of the
[28] There is also the potential for significant conflict between the family
members on the one hand and MLA’s friend, JT on
the other hand. Issues
surrounding contact therefore need to be managed.
[29] Finally, although MLA is currently accommodated at residential nursing care
facility, if that facility were to become unsuitable
for MLA’s needs in
the future, then an accommodation decision would need to be made. Once again
because of the conflict between
family members and JT, a formal decision maker
would be necessary.
[30] MLA has complex needs in relation to health care, service provision,
accommodation and contact. These needs cannot be met adequately
by informal
decision making. The Tribunal is satisfied that a guardian should be
IF SO WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED?
[31] MLA had executed an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) in favour of her
mother, CP, prior to her accident. One of the matters
for determination by the
Tribunal concerned the application by CP seeking leave to resign as
[32] CP explained that she considered MLA’s care needs to be so complex
that it was more beneficial for all decision making
to be made by the
“committee” of family members who had made the application, rather
than by her alone under the authority
of the EPA.
[33] The Tribunal explained to CP that if she were given leave to resign as
attorney, then the power to act under the EPA would be
relinquished completely,
and given MLA’s severe cognitive impairment she would never again be able
to appoint another attorney.
[34] On the other hand, if CP were to remain as attorney, but be appointed by
the Tribunal as guardian and or administrator with
the other family members,
then the EPA would simply be overtaken for the duration of the Tribunal’s
[35] The Tribunal further explained that the benefit of taking the latter course
was that MLA’s wishes would be respected insofar
as the appointment of an
attorney was concerned, and sometime in the future her needs might be adequately
addressed by the use of
the EPA alone. That would then be the least restrictive
option if there were no longer a need for a Tribunal order, and the Tribunal
orders could cease.
[36] CP advised the Tribunal that she was unaware that the EPA could effectively
co-exist with Tribunal orders, and simply be overtaken
in relation to decision
making in the manner described. On this basis, therefore, CP withdrew her
application for leave to resign.
The Tribunal approved that
withdrawal.
[37] Upon doing so, the Tribunal considered the two available options for
appointment as guardian, namely the applicants or the Adult
[38] Mr Smith, the applicants’ solicitor, advised the Tribunal that his
clients would be seeking, obtaining and maintaining
appropriate health care for
MLA. In his submission, Mr Smith noted that the level of care MLA was receiving
under the general management
of his clients was demonstrably appropriate, being
extensive and diverse across a wide range of medical and health services and
disciplines.
[39] Mr Smith also pointed out that the involvement of the Adult Guardian so far
has been, in effect, to endorse the past actions
of his clients in the face of
strident criticism of them by JT, which upon detailed investigation by the Adult
Guardian was found
to be baseless.
[40] Mr Smith stated that his clients would attempt to maintain an objective
view of JT’s friendship with MLA, but would also
regard her well being as
their first priority. To this extent therefore, they would feel compelled to
act, and possibly restrict
JT’s contact with MLA if they considered it
might be harmful to her. To support that concern, evidence was given that JT had
occasionally urged MLA to spit out her medication.
[41] When questioned about this by the Tribunal, JT stated that he had once told
MLA to spit out her medication, but that this was
, to see how far she could spit it.
[42] The Tribunal was confident that MLA’s health care providers would not
have seen the humour in JT’s “joke”.
It was clear that none of
MLA’s family considered it amusing.
[43] The Tribunal regarded this evidence as demonstrating, at the very least,
poor judgment on JT’s part, and at worst, dangerous
[44] The Tribunal also noted that JT had forwarded two letters to the Adult
Guardian purporting to have been signed by MLA. These
letters, dated 18
September 2005 and 12 October 2005, were discussed in considerable detail in the
Adult Guardian’s report
dated 12 December 2005 (at page 9). It is not
intended to repeat that discussion here, as all relevant parties, including JT,
had the opportunity to peruse that report.
[45] The Adult Guardian concluded the discussion of the letters with the
following statement:
“JT’s dubious actions in compiling these documents raise
significant concerns as to the appropriateness and suitability
of any future
role of responsibility
[46] The Tribunal questioned JT at some length about the circumstances
surrounding the compilation of these letters. JT ultimately
acknowledged that
the assertions made in the letters were beyond the comprehension of MLA and were
instead representative of his
views of the matters outlined in the letters.
[47] The Tribunal shared the extreme disquiet of the Adult Guardian in relation
to JT’s actions concerning the letters.
[48] The Tribunal was satisfied that JT lacked insight into the full extent of
MLA’s cognitive disability and her complex on-going
needs. The Tribunal
was further satisfied that contact between JT and MLA was an issue about which
decisions would undoubtedly need
to be made in the future, and that the
acknowledged past behaviour of JT had been such that restrictions might need to
upon him in the future if he fails to act reasonably in relation to
his contact with MLA.
[49] The Tribunal was further satisfied that whilst JT might have had a close
friendship with MLA at the time of her tragic accident,
there was no evidence
that they were “partners” as claimed by JT. In making this finding,
the Tribunal has accepted the
were not living together;
They had not
pooled their financial resources; and
were not holding themselves out to others as being in a
“marriage-like”
relationship.
[50] The Tribunal is satisfied that the applicants should be appointed as
guardians for MLA. The Tribunal accepts the evidence of
their suitability, and
also accepts that they have made decisions which have protected and will
continue to protect MLA’s interests
and welfare in accordance with the
general principles of the legislation.
IS THERE A NEED FOR
THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATOR?
[51] There is no question that MLA cannot manage any aspect of her financial
affairs. Not only does she have significant sums of
money currently invested as
a result of her permanent disablement under QSuper, but she also will receive a
“substantial”
award of damages from her personal injuries claim.
[52] The personal injuries claim alone will require significant input from a
formal decision maker. Informal arrangements are unsuitable
circumstances.
[53] The Tribunal is satisfied that there is a need for an administrator to be
IF SO WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED?
[54] The applicants have demonstrated by their actions to date that they have a
proper understanding of the matters with which they
must concern themselves to
properly protect MLA’s interests. They have taken professional advice
before making their decisions,
and have expressed their willingness to continue
to be guided by relevant professionals in the future.
[55] The other option for appointment is the Public Trustee. The applicants have
not challenged the expertise of the Public Trustee
in these matters. However,
they have pointed out that there will obviously be significant fees payable to
the Public Trustee if it
were to be appointed, whereas that money could be
better utilised in providing ongoing care for MLA.
[56] The applicants have also pointed out that their motivation in offering
themselves as administrators emanates from their genuine
concern for and love of
MLA as family members. They have noted that MLA’s future care needs will
be costly and that they wish
to ensure that those needs can always be
[57] The Tribunal is satisfied that it is appropriate to appoint the applicants
as administrators for MLA. The Tribunal accepts that
they have taken relevant
professional advice in relation to financial decisions taken to date, and that
they will continue to do
so. The Tribunal further accepts that they have a
genuine understanding of MLA’s needs, and that they are motivated by the
desire to ensure her future financial security.
