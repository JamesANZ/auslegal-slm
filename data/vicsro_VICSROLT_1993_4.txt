Interest on refunds of tax
Revenue Ruling LT.004
Section 90 of the
Land Tax Act 1958
requires the
Commissioner to repay amounts of overpaid tax,
subject to certain restrictions.
In such cases, taxpayers frequently request the
Commissioner to pay interest on the amount repaid.
Such interest may be payable under the
(Interest on Overpayments) Act 1986.
This ruling outlines the circumstances in which
interest may be paid on refunds of land tax.
In accordance with the
Taxation (Interest on
Overpayments) Act 1986
, interest on refunds of tax
will only be paid where the overpayment giving rise
to the refund was a result of the following.
• A decision of the Commissioner upon an
objection, or
• A decision of the Tribunal, or
• A decision of a court in relation to:
• an objection; or
• a decision of the Tribunal.
Upon the success of such an appeal or objection,
interest will be paid on refunds of tax at the rate set
by the Governor-in-Council (10.085 per cent per
annum as at 1 April 1993).
