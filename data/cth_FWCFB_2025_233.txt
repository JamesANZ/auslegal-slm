GRILL’D ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT 2025
Fast food industry
DEPUTY PRESIDENT MILLHOUSE
COMMISSIONER LEE
COMMISSIONER YILMAZ
MELBOURNE, 17 OCTOBER 2025
Application for approval of the Grill’d Enterprise Agreement
An application has been made for approval of an enterprise agreement
known as the
Grill’d Enterprise Agreement 2025
(Agreement). The
application was made pursuant to
Fair Work Act 2009
(Act). It has been made by Grill’d Pty Ltd (Employer). The Agreement is a
single enterprise agreement.
The United Workers’ Union (UWU) indicated in the F18 filed that
they opposed the approval of the Agreement on a number of grounds
such that the
Commission could not be satisfied of a number of statutory requirements
including that the Agreement was not genuinely
agreed and that the Agreement did
not pass the Better off Overall Test. The Shop, Distributive and Allied
Employees Association (SDA)
also opposed the approval of the Agreement and
largely echoed the concerns raised by the UWU. Pursuant to ss 582 and 615 of the
the matter was referred to a Full Bench of the Commission. The Full Bench
raised a number of concerns with the Employer as to pre-approval
requirements
and BOOT concerns.
The Employer and the UWU filed materials in accordance with the
directions, and a hearing was conducted before the Full Bench on Wednesday
August 2025. Subsequent to the hearing, the applicant provided a proposed
undertaking providing for a reconciliation clause to
operate and further
undertakings prohibiting split shifts and seeking to amend wording in the
workplace delegates rights clause.
A conference was conducted before Commissioner Lee on Monday 13
October 2025. At that conference, the employer agreed to amend the
undertaking in a number of respects. Based on the amended undertaking, the UWU
withdrew their objections to the approval
of the Agreement and the SDA stated
that they did not wish to be heard or express any views.
As set out below, the Employer has provided written undertakings A
copy of the undertakings is attached at Annexure A. We are satisfied
undertakings will not cause financial detriment to any employee covered by the
Agreement and that the undertakings will
not result in substantial changes to
the Agreement. The undertakings are taken to be a term of the Agreement.
Having regard to the extensive material put before the Full Bench and
subject to the undertakings referred to above, we are satisfied
requirement of ss 186, 187, 188 and 190 as are relevant to this application for
approval have been met. For the purposes
of the better off overall test, we have
had regard to each of the matters in s 193A(2)-(7).
It is apparent that in clause 45.7 of the Agreement that the word
“of” that appears immediately after the words “during
hours” should read “or”. The parties agree that this is an
obvious error and capable of variation under
s 218A of the Act. The Full Bench
exercises its power pursuant to s 218A(2)(b) of the Act to correct this obvious
error. Clause 45.7
will now read as follows:
A workplace delegate may
communicate with eligible employees during working hours or work breaks, or
before or after work.
The UWU and the SDA being bargaining representatives for the
Agreement have given notice under s 183 of the Act that they want the
to cover them. In accordance with s 201(2) of the Act we note that the Agreement
covers the organisations.
The Employer has requested that if approved that the Agreement
operate 28 days from the date of the approval decision to provide time
implement the new rostering system and associated terms. While we have sympathy
for that submission, delayed implementation is
not possible having regard to the
provisions of s 54 of the Act.
The Agreement is approved and, in accordance with s 54 of the Act
will operate from 24 October 2025. The nominal expiry date of the
Agreement is
17 October 2029.
