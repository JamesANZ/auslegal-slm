Decision Outcome
Terms of Extended Supervision Order varied pursuant to
Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act
(NSW) [65].
On 28 February 2002, the offender was sentenced for three counts of
aggravated sexual assault [13]. He was sixteen at the time of
the offences [30].
He was released from custody on 4 June 2009 and interim supervision orders were
made in July of that year [14].
On 14 August 2009, Hall J made an extended supervision order pursuant to the
Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act
) [1]. By amended notice of motion, the State of New South Wales (
) sought orders to vary the conditions placed on the ESO by
substituting those conditions with some 62 conditions concerning the offender's
conduct [1].
The offender was incarcerated for a number of years since his release from
gaol [9]. On every occasion that he was incarcerated, it
was the result of
breaching the ESO or breaching parole [30]. At no stage had he been convicted of
any offence apart from breaching
the ESO [9]. He had not been convicted of, or
charged, with any serious offence [30]. The breaches generally related to
alcohol and
drug use and non-compliance with curfews [9], [18]-[20], [23].
During the course of the proceedings, the parties reached agreement in
relation to all but four conditions under consideration [47]:
Re-introduction
of electronic monitoring [38];
offender] must truthfully answer questions from his Department Supervising
), or anyone else supervising him, about where he is and
where he is going" [52];
offender] must not associate with any people who [he knows] are drunk, or under
the influence of illegal drugs" [57]; and
offender] must allow the DSO to search him, or any part of, or anything in, his
house or car, if the DSO thinks that search
needs to be done for the safety of
another person, or because they think that [the offender] might have breached
this order" [61].

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/ or indicators of disadvantage
Hamill J noted that the offender suffered from an intellectual disability
[7]. His Honour found that the practical implementation
and enforcement of the
ESO had been punitive and was contrary to the intention of both the Act and the
ESO itself [8].
His Honour acknowledged expert evidence that the offender's "culture and
lifestyle...exacerbates his risk of serious reoffending overall
rather than
increasing his risk of sexual reoffending specifically" [11].
During the offender's incarceration and period in custody, he was exposed and
developed an addiction to harder drugs [20], [22]. His
Honour referred to
evidence from a community justice program representative that she did not
perceive sexual offending to be an issue
for the offender but that "alcohol,
drug use and aggression were of concern" due to the offender being "not
permitted to return to
his people" [22].
Michael Spurrier, a senior clinical consultant with the New South Wales
Department of Family and Community Service and the Community
Justice Progress
Programs, provided a review of the offender's situation, identifying that:
"... reasons for lack of engagement with Mr Carr included a lack of
previous consideration for Mr Carr 's significant drug and alcohol
along with his Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander cultural background and
interpersonal/emotional needs. For example,
CJP provided support to Mr Carr
while he lived alone in a property where his reported feeling isolated from
others and from his
His Honour noted that it was troubling that Mr Spurrier had made an
observation that the offender's supervisors had failed to consider
Aboriginality [26].
Despite there being "no warrant in the Act for treating Aboriginal offenders
differently from offenders of other ethnic or cultural
backgrounds" [27], his
Honour, citing
State of New South Wales v Hill (No 5)
[2013] NSWSC 140
, found that it was appropriate to consider the history of treatment of
Indigenous Australians by authorities and the level of exclusion
discrimination that still occurred in assessing the offender's reaction to the
imposition of restrictions by authorities [27].
Hamill J accepted that the
evidence demonstrated that the offender's life had all the of the features
discussed in cases such as
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
Western Australia
[2013] HCA 38
[2014] NSWCCA 156
R v Hines (No 3)
[2014] NSWSC 1273
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A
His Honour found that the offender had "lived a life of dysfunction,
alienation and deprivation" [27]
Relevant passage(s):
"Whether or not [the observation by Mr Spurrier was correct], it is extremely
troubling that the opinion of Mr Spurrier was that some
4 years after his
release, a review of the files suggested that those administering his
supervision had failed to take into account
the real and significant
difficulties being experienced by a young, intellectually disabled, offender of
Aboriginal descent. It is
hardly conducive to the rehabilitation of such an
offender that such matters are not taken into account. This is particularly so
in circumstances where he had been locked up on no less than 5 occasions - not
as a result of committing independent crimes, let
alone crimes of violence - but
because he had breached the very onerous conditions of the extended supervision
"Of course, there is no warrant in the
Act for treating Aboriginal
offenders differently from offenders of other ethnic and cultural backgrounds:
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
; 249 CLR 571 at
Western Australia
[2013] HCA 38
; 294 CLR 600 at
. However, the comments
of Rothman J resonate in the circumstances of the present case. The evidence in
this case demonstrates that
the defendant's life has had all of the features
discussed in cases such as
Bugmy v The Queen
Munda v The Queen,
[2014] NSWCCA 156
R v Hines (No 3)
[2014] NSWSC 1273
and the earlier case of
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A Crim R 58.
He has lived
a life of dysfunction, alienation and deprivation." [26]-[27]
Grounds of appeal:
Not applicable.
Submissions on disputed conditions:
Condition 1: Re-introduction of electronic monitoring
The State contended that the reintroduction of electronic monitoring would
provide the offender with an incentive to comply with the
restrictions on his
movements and enable those monitoring him to quickly determine whether he was
compliant with the ESO [39]. The
offender submitted that electronic monitoring
would be counter-productive and "not warranted in view of the history which
the absence of any suggestion of offending other than the breaches of
the ESO..." [40].
Condition 2: The offender "must truthfully answer questions from his DSO,
or anyone else supervising him, about where he is and where
he is going"
The offender opposed this order on the grounds that it had the "potential to
criminalise his conduct; particularly in circumstances
where there may be some
change in his plans or movement schedule" and that it raised issues surrounding
the question of truthfulness
[53]. The offender also submitted that the other
conditions relating to his movements were sufficient and that the additional
in the order would unnecessarily complicate matters [53]. The State
submitted that the order was not confusing, that it was important
to allow the
offender's supervisors to be aware of his movements and to ensure the safety of
the community [54].
Condition 3: The offender "must not associate with any people who he knows
are drunk, or under the influence of illegal drugs."
The offender submitted that the condition might criminalise ordinary social
interactions [57]. The State pointed to the background
of the matter and the
fact that the offender was "susceptible to the influence of others who have been
consuming drugs or alcohol"
Condition 4: The offender "must allow the DSO to search him, or any part
of, or anything in, his house or car, if the DSO thinks that
done for the safety of another person, or because they think that he might have
breached this order."
The offender emphasised that his behavioural history related to being
criminalised as a result of breaches of the ESO and parole,
and that there was
nothing in his history to suggest that he would be carrying a weapon or other
house breaking implements [63].
The offender also submitted that the other
agreed conditions concerning drug use, drug testing and attendance at
rehabilitation programmes
would sufficiently control his behaviour in respect of
drug use [63].
to make the order for Condition 1 [46]. His Honour took the same approach in
State of New South Wales v Hill (No 5)
[2013] NSWSC 140
in which Rothman
J held at [27] that "the Court must balance the desire to ensure structure in
[the offender's] life and the protection
of the community associated with that
structure against the imposition of conditions restricting a person's liberty".
Hamill J found
electronic monitoring was more likely to be "counter-productive",
"likely to exacerbate the [offender's] frustrations and...unlikely
any more protection to the community than other orders that can be made in
relation to the monitoring and supervision
of [the offender's] conduct"
the order for Condition 2 [55]. His Honour accepted the State's submissions and
found that it was a particularly important
condition given the decision not to
re-introduce electronic monitoring [55].
Condition 3 to "[the offender] must not associate with any people who he knows
intend to take illegal drugs" [60]. His Honour
found that the offender's problem
related to drugs rather than alcohol and amended the condition to reflect this
[59]. His Honour
noted that the offender's original offending was associated
with the consumption of alcohol, but acknowledged that there was another
that specifically prohibited the offender from consuming alcohol which he had so
far complied with [59].
to make the order for Condition 4 [64]. His Honour accepted the offender's
submissions concerning his lack of history of
carrying weapons and the
sufficiency of other agreed orders to control his drug use
