D E C I S I O N
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal by Mr Michael Cirillo, licensed trainer,
against the decision of the stewards made on 18 February 2008,
Cirillo was found guilty of breaching Harness Racing Rule No.190(1) in respect
of his horse Minda McKenzie and was subsequently
fined $8000. Harness Racing
Rule No.190(1) states, "A horse shall be presented for a race free of a
prohibited substances."
Rule 190(2) states, "If a horse is presented for a race otherwise in
accordance with Sub-rule(1), the trainer of the horse is guilty
of an offence."
Rule 190(4) states, "An offence under Sub-rule(2) is committed
regardless of the circumstances in which the prohibited substance
can be present
in or on the horse."
The net result of the rules means that if a horse has, within its
system on race day, a carbon dioxide reading TCO2 present at a
concentration of
greater than 36 millimoles per litre in plasma, it has within its system a
prohibited substance.
The appellant is a licensed trainer and on 18 January 2008, at the
Charlton Harness Race meeting, he presented his horse, Minda
McKenzie, in Race
3, the Metropolitan Harness Racing Club Claiming Pace. Minda McKenzie was
placed fourth in the event. A pre-race
blood sample was taken from the horse
Minda McKenzie prior to competing in Race 3.
On 18 February 2008, stewards found the appellant had presented his
horse, Minda McKenzie, at such harness race meeting when it
was not free from a
prohibited substance, and that such horse had an elevated TCO2 reading above the
prescribed limit. And they
sent the matter before this Tribunal, proceeded by
way of an appeal against conviction and penalty. However, Mr Peace, who
was granted
leave to appear on behalf of Mr Cirillo, indicated after a
short way into the proceeding, that the matter was only now going to proceed
way of penalty only. Accordingly the appeal is now as to penalty only.
As has been stated by the Racing Appeals Tribunal on a number of
occasions, the rule which prohibits the presentation of a horse
meeting with a prohibited substance within its system is a rule designed to
ensure, as far as possible, that there is a
level playing field. It is a matter
of critical importance to the racing industry and integrity of the racing
industry. The responsibility
is on the trainer and on the trainer alone to
present his or her horse free from a prohibited substance. The rule itself is
of absolute liability and designed to preserve the integrity and public
confidence in the racing industry.
Principles of general deterrence and denunciation clearly apply to a
trainer who presents his or her horse with a prohibited substance
system. In the end, however, each case and penalty must depend on its own
individual circumstances.
Penalty, general circumstances. The appellant, Mr Michael
Cirillo, has been a licensed trainer for some 18 years. He has a prior
conviction for which he was disqualified for a period of six months in June
1993, where a horse of his had a prohibited substance
within its system. He
has, however, been in no trouble since June of 1993, and considering that he had
continued as an active licensed
harness racing trainer for some 15 years since
his conviction, such prior conviction, in my opinion, should carry little
Mr Cirillo works approximately up to 20 horses as a professional
trainer. The appellant has no staff and works the horses himself.
appellant has the expenses of approximately $6000-$8000 per month. Mr Peace
submitted on his behalf several matters that should
be taken into account in
mitigation of penalty.
The first was that the appellant did not receive a letter from Harness
Racing Victoria notifying him of concerns of elevated TCO2
readings in respect
of Minda McKenzie back in 2004. On the available evidence before me, I am
prepared to accept that no such letter
was received by Mr Cirillo at the
relevant time. However, Mr Peace, sensibly in my opinion, did accept that
such letters were sent
out as a matter of courtesy to licensed harness racing
trainers and the ultimate responsibility must always rest with the trainer
to present his horse at a race meeting if it has within its system a prohibited
Nevertheless, I do accept on the available evidence that in the
circumstances where Mr Cirillo has received letters from Harness
Racing Victoria
concerning his horses' elevated TCO2 readings, he has taken appropriate steps
and that no horse of his named in a
relevant letter has subsequently tested
positive. Overall, it must always be borne in mind still that these are
courtesy letters
and the responsibility for presenting a horse at a race meeting
free from a prohibited substance is totally and solely on the trainer.
that Mr Cirillo did not receive a warning letter in the circumstance of
this case can be given only limited weight as a
matter in mitigation.
The second matter that Mr Peace submitted, which I accept, is that
Minda McKenzie is a horse with a higher than average TCO2 resting
reading. The
third matter Mr Peace submitted, which again I accept, is that the elevated
reading in this case was due to inadvertence
and not a deliberate act or a
reckless act in breach of the rules of harness racing. The fourth matter Mr
Peace submitted which
I accept, is that for the last 15 years Mr Cirillo has had
a clean record.
Mr Burns, on behalf of the stewards, submitted that when one looks at
the penalties for first offenders for breaching proscribed
TCO2 limits, a fine
of $8000 has been deemed to be an appropriate penalty and that overall, the
prior conviction of the appellant
has some weight to be taken into account in
the sentencing process, as does the fact that Mr Cirillo did not receive a
warning letter
and that accordingly $8000 is an appropriate amount.
Taking into account all the matters submitted by the parties
representatives, I am of the opinion that the appropriate penalty is
of $8000. I stress that this opinion is mine and mine alone, but I am most
grateful for the advice of Ms Dianne Davies
and Ms Elizabeth Clark who are
of the same opinion as myself is the appropriate penalty.
HIS HONOUR: There's two matters; first of all, Mr Peace, do you want to
make a submission about the penalty, as to when it should
be paid? I'm prepared
to grant you a stay if you would so desire.
MR PEACE: Yes, please, I could do with a stay, if I could, thank you.
HIS HONOUR: Yes. Anything you want to say about that,
MR BURNS: No, Your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, well, I grant a stay of two months to pay the penalty.
MR PEACE: Thank you.
HIS HONOUR: And as to the refund, Mr Burns, I was going to order the
MR BURNS: I'd say nothing about that Your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, and I order refund of the deposit in respect of the
