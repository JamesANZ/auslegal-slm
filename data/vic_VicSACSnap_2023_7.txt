Sentencing Snapshot 279: Sentencing Trends for Rape in the Higher Courts
of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of rape in
the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2017-18 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on rape and other offences is available on
A person who intentionally sexually penetrates another person without that
other person's consent is guilty of the offence of rape.
Sexual penetration
includes oral, anal and vaginal penetration and may be committed by and against
both men and women. However, rape
is overwhelmingly committed by men against
women. Rape is an indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years'
imprisonment.
Rape is a category 1 offence if it was committed on or after 20 March 2017.
For this offence, this classification means that courts
must always impose a
custodial sentence.
Rape is also a
standard sentence offence if it was committed on or after 1 February 2018. This
means that courts must take into account
that a prison sentence of 10 years
represents the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this
This Snapshot focuses on cases where rape was the principal offence, that is,
cases where rape was the offence that received the most
Rape was the principal offence in 2.4% of cases sentenced in the higher
courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 201 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of rape.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
rape by financial year. There were 47 people sentenced
for this offence in
2021-22, up from 25 in the previous year. The number of people sentenced was
highest in 2018-19 (49 people) and
lowest in 2020-21 (25 people). There were 68
people whose offending attracted standard sentence offence classification.

Figure 2 shows the proportion of people who received
an immediate custodial sentence or non-custodial sentence for the principal
of rape. An immediate custodial sentence involves at least some element
of immediate imprisonment or
The rate of immediate
custodial sentences was lowest in 2017-18 (90.7%) and highest in 2019-20
(97.3%). Over the five-year period,
94.0% of people were given an immediate
custodial sentence.

centre order (5.0% or 10 people) or

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the offence of rape from 2017-18 to 2021-22.
The principal sentence applies to a single offence at a
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves multiple charges,
the total effective sentence will be either the same as or longer than the
Principal sentences of imprisonment
There were 179 principal sentences of imprisonment
for rape. Of these, 178 (99.4%) were non-aggregate imprisonment terms, that is,
the imprisonment terms were not part of an aggregate sentence, and 1 was an
aggregate imprisonment term.
were 2 people who received a community correction order in addition to their
imprisonment term.
Figure 3 shows the imprisonment lengths for the 178 non-aggregate
imprisonment terms for the offence of rape. Imprisonment lengths
ranged from 39
days to 12 years,
median imprisonment length was 6 years.
The most common range of imprisonment lengths was 6 to less than 7 years (40
principal sentences).
Imprisonment lengths for principal offences of rape subject to the standard
sentence ranged from 1 year and 8
to 12 years, with a
median imprisonment length of 6 years and 6 months.

non-aggregate
imprisonment terms, the average imprisonment length ranged from 5 years and 9
months in 2018-19 to 6 years and 9 months
in 2021-22. Over the five-year period,
the average imprisonment length for rape was 6 years and 3 months. The average
imprisonment
length for rape as a standard sentence offence was 6 years and 4
The imprisonment lengths for rape as a standard sentence offence are
presented separately because courts sentencing standard sentence
offences 'must
only have regard to sentences previously imposed for the offence as a standard
sentence offence'.
sentencing non-standard sentence offences must have regard to sentences imposed
when the offence both was and was not a standard
sentence offence.

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 179 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for rape, 178 were
eligible to have a non-parole period
Of these people, 175 were
given a non-parole period
Note that it was not
possible to determine the non-parole period for 1

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for rape face multiple
charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks at the
of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of rape.
Figure 9 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
rape by the total number of sentenced offences per person.
The number of
sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 24, and the median was 2
offences. There were 58 people (28.9%) sentenced
for the single offence of rape.
The average number of offences per person was 4.0.

rape, by the number of sentenced offences per person, 2017-18
Number of offences
Table 2 shows the 10 most common offences co-sentenced alongside rape. The
last column sets out the average number of offences sentenced
per person. For
example, 43 of the total 201 people (21.4%) were also sentenced for sexual
assault. On average, those 43 people were
sentenced for 1.5 charges of sexual
assault per case.

From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 201 people were sentenced
in the higher courts for the principal offence of rape. Of those 201 people, 179
(89.1%) received a principal sentence of imprisonment.
Total effective sentences of imprisonment ranged from 39 days to 25 years and
5 months, and non-parole periods ranged from 10 months
to 20 years and 10
months. The median total effective sentence was 7 years and 6 months, while the
median non-parole period was 5
years. On average, people sentenced for rape were
sentenced for 4.0 offences each, with a maximum of 24 offences.
Of the 68 principal offences of rape subject to the standard sentence in this
period, 60 received imprisonment (88.2%), 7 received
a youth justice centre
order (10.3%) and 1 received a community correction order (1.5%). The average
imprisonment length for the
60 charges that received imprisonment was 6 years
and 4 months, which is higher than the overall average of 6 years and 3 months
for the 178 principal offences that received a non-aggregate imprisonment term
during this period.
