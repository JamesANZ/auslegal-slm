Social Security Act 1991
Table G1 in 1064-G3
Applicant seeks review of a Centrelink decision to reduce her rate of disability
support pension (DSP) from 28 January 2024 on
the basis that the value of the
her assets from
that date. The value of her property had not been taken into
account under the assets test for the previous two years, although she
ceased living there from late January 2022. The decision to reduce her rate of
DSP was affirmed by an authorised review officer
on 24 August 2024 and this
Tribunal on first review on 21 February 2025. The Applicant’s case is that
she had continued to
live away from her home due to exceptional circumstances in
that she had moved to Queensland to care for her elderly mother in January
and did not return to live in her NSW home until early May 2025, shortly after
her mother had passed away. She seeks to have
her NSW property treated as her
principal home from 28 January 2024 so that its value would not be assessed
under the assets test.
conducted a telephone hearing on 5 November 2025. The relevant facts are in
short compass. The Applicant moved from her home in
NSW on 28 January 2022 to
live with and provide care for her elderly mother in Queensland; the extent of
care she provided was essentially
full-time. The property she and herf mother
lived in was owned by her brother. She was unsure how long she would need to
her mother. Initially, she rented out the NSW property for six months.
It continued to be rented out for more than two years; the
responsible real
estate agent advised the tenant moved out on 10 May 2024. Shortly after this,
the Applicant’s son moved in.
The Applicant returned to the NSW property
for about four to six weeks around August 2024 to assist her son in clearing out
and, no doubt, to have a break from her caring responsibilities. From
the time she left the NSW property on 28 January 2022 until
her return in early
May 2025, this was the only occasion she returned to the property. The Applicant
paid for various outgoings such
as council rates and water accounts whilst the
NSW property was being rented. Once the tenant moved out in May 2024, she also
for electricity for the property. The NSW property remained recorded as her
address on the electoral roll throughout. Centrelink’s
records reflect
that her address changed from the NSW property to the Queensland address on 28
January 2022 and remained so until
2 May 2025. The Applicant told me she always
considered the NSW property to be her home and she always intended to return
she was no longer required to care for her mother. It was a 13-hour
drive from the Queensland property to her NSW property which
made frequent
visits impossible. She had brought the lease on the NSW property to an end in
the first half of 2024 because her mother
was doing poorly at that stage;
however, her mother rallied and ultimately passed away on 30 April 2025.
Consideration
is a means-tested payment. The
Social Security Act 1991
(Act) contains
provisions concerning both an income test and an assets test; the test which
results in the lower rate of DSP will
the Applicant’s rate of DSP was assessed under the income test up to 27
January 2024; she was receiving rental income
for the NSW property. Her
fortnightly rate of payment was $898.68. From 28 January 2024, her rate of
payment was assessed under the
assets test. Her fortnightly rate reduced to
$844.70. The practical result was a reduction in her DSP rate of about $54 per
Applicant’s DSP was assessed under the assets test from 28 January 2024
because, from that date, Centrelink included the
net value of her NSW property
in the assessment of the value of her assets. Whether it was correct to do so is
the critical issue
in this case.
is no doubt that the Applicant’s NSW property is an asset as defined under
the Act. Ordinarily, however, the value of
a person’s principal home is
disregarded under the assets test, provided they have reasonable security of
tenure: see paragraph
1118(1)(a) of the Act. The Applicant holds legal title to
the NSW property which gives her reasonable security of tenure so that
position of a person’s principal home not counting under the assets test
is the starting point for my consideration.
course, there were important changes to the Applicant’s circumstances on
and from 28 January 2022. She moved to Queensland
to provide full-time care for
her mother and rented out her NSW property thereafter.
way the asset test provisions operate in this case depends on whether the
Applicant was to be regarded as a “homeowner”
after 28 January 2022.
This is because the applicable asset value limit differs, depending on whether
the Applicant was a homeowner
or not: see Table G1 in section 1064-G3 of the
term “homeowner” is defined in subsection 11(4) of the Act. Here,
the Applicant was a homeowner if she had a right
or interest in her
“principal home” which gave her reasonable security of tenure. The
term “principal home”
is not specifically defined, although various
provisions in section 11A of the Act are relevant. For example, the
Applicant’s
NSW property is a dwelling-house so that subsection 11A(1)
explains that the reference to a person’s principal home includes
the house is located on.
Importantly,
paragraph 11A(9)(f) of the Act has application in this case. It
(9) A residence of a

(f) any period of up to 2
absent from the residence and is
a substantial level of
another private residence for another
needs, or in the Secretary's opinion is likely to need, that level of
a private residence for at least 14 consecutive days.
This is the provision which operated to exempt the NSW property from being
assessed under the assets test for two years from 28 January
2022, despite the
Applicant living elsewhere. Without this provision, the value of the NSW
property would have had to have been included
in assessing the Applicant’s
assets to calculate her rate of DSP.
a temporary absence from a person’s principal home may not mean its status
as their principal home must inevitably change,
the additional factor here is
that the Applicant rented out her property from 28 January 2022. She then lived
in Queensland with
her mother; that was where she ate, slept, provided care to
her mother and attended to her usual activities of daily life. The NSW
was occupied by a tenant who paid rent until 10 May 2024. She did not return to
the property to live in it on an ongoing
basis until 2 May 2025. In those
circumstances, I find the NSW property ceased to be the Applicant’s
principal home from 28
January 2022.
means, given the operation of the relevant provisions in the Act, the Applicant
was no longer a homeowner as defined on and from
28 January 2024. The asset
value limit for a single, non-homeowner applied to her; this was $543,750 in
January 2024. Because the
Act did not permit an extension to the two-year period
of exemption from 28 January 2022, Centrelink was correct to include the net
value of the NSW property in assessing the value of her assets.
January 2024, the Applicant had provided Centrelink with a value of $700,000 for
the NSW property. The evidence established that
there was an outstanding amount
of $79,498 owing on the property as at 31 December 2023, which was secured by a
mortgage. Together
with household contents of $5,000, the amount included in the
value of her assets was $625,511. Once the value of her car, cash at
the like was included, the Applicant’s total assets were assessed at
$627,821. Since this value was above the assets
value limit of $543,750, the
excess had the effect of a reduction in her fortnightly pension of $3 per every
$1,000 above the asset
value limit.
see no error in this approach; nor do I consider any other approach to assessing
the value of the Applicant’s assets was open
in these circumstances. It
follows the Centrelink decision on 23 January 2024 to reduce the
Applicant’s rate of DSP from 28
January 2024 was correct.
seems appropriate to make a couple of additional observations. The Applicant
relied on her exceptional circumstances to seek a
more flexible approach. There
is no discretion to extend the two-year exemption period after which, on the
findings I have made,
Centrelink was required to include the value of the NSW
property in assessing her rate of DSP. Although not strictly necessary to
determine, it is clear enough the Applicant at no time re-established residence
at the NSW property before May 2025; she accepted
the time she spent at the
house in August 2024 was a visit after which she returned to Queensland to
continue caring for her mother.
A new two-year exemption period could not start
from the end of her visit in the circumstances.
