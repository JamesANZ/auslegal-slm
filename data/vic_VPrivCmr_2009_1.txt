Complainant AL v Local Council
[2009] VPrivCmr 1
2009 VPrivCmr 1
allegation that the Local Council failed to provide adequate notice about whom
it usually discloses personal information
to. Use and disclosure
– allegation that the Local Council disclosed personal information for a
purpose either unrelated to collection or one which
was not reasonably expected.
The Complaint
The Complainant made a submission to the Local Council which contained her
personal information including her name and residential
The Complainant subsequently conducted a Google internet search of her name
and discovered that her personal information had been
posted on the Local
Council’s website. The Complainant was not aware her personal information
would be made public in this
matter and consequently made a complaint to the
Local Council.
The Local Council promptly responded to the Complainant’s complaint. In
its response, the Local Council advised the Complainant
that the personal
information is typically removed from submissions before they are placed on
Council’s website but that it
seemed that Council had inadvertently failed
to sufficiently de-identify the Complainant’s submission. Council
apologised for
the error and further advised that it had deactivated the
relevant page on its website and contacted Google in order to have the
versions of the webpage removed.
The Complainant again wrote to the Local Council claiming that the Council
had not enquired as to whether she had suffered any hurt
or loss as a result of
the publication.
The Local Council responded to the Complainant by reiterating the apology,
confirming the information had been removed from the internet
and advising that
plans were in place for staff at the Council to undergo privacy training.
Council also attempted to allay the Complainant’s fears regarding
identity theft by suggesting that the disclosure of the Complainant’s
and address, without more, was not likely to increase the Complainant’s
risk of being a victim of identity theft.
The Complainant was still dissatisfied with Council’s response and made
a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner. The Complainant
alleged a breach of IPP
1.3 (failure to provide adequate notice of how personal information would be
used and disclosed) and a breach
of IPP 2 (disclosure of personal information
for a purpose unrelated to the purpose of collection or one which was not
The Decision
The Commissioner stated that where there has been a potential interference
with the privacy of an individual in circumstances such
as these – namely,
where an individual’s personal information has been disclosed to the
public – it is not possible
for an individual’s privacy to be
completely restored. Because of this, addressing a privacy complaint naturally
involves investigating
how a privacy breach has occurred, taking all reasonable
steps to ensure that the potential breach is not repeated and making attempts
rectify any loss suffered.
The Commissioner considered that the Local Council had taken immediate steps
to minimise the disclosure (once notified of its existence)
and had arranged
such an error is not repeated.
The Commissioner also noted that the Council had
given the Complainant a written apology on two separate occasions, had advised
Complainant of the steps taken to rectify the breach and prevent it from
reoccurring and had endeavoured to respond to the Complainant’s
regarding identity theft.
In light of the steps taken by the Council, the Commissioner considered that
the complaint had been adequately dealt with and declined
to entertain the
complaint under Section 29(1)(h)(i)
