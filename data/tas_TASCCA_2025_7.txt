REASONS FOR JUDGMENT COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL
30 June 2025
Introduction
appellant was convicted by a jury of Persistent Sexual Abuse of a Child
committed between about 1 February 2018 and 20 August
2020. The complainant
(A), the appellant's daughter, was born in February 2007.
jury also convicted the appellant of Indecent Assault committed between about 1
June 2020 and 10 August 2020. Count 2 involved
a different complainant (B), the
appellant's niece. At the relevant time B was aged 15 years.
the crime of Persistent Sexual Abuse, Jago J imposed a sentence of imprisonment
of 12 years, with a non-parole period of six
years and six months. Her Honour
imposed a sentence of eight months' imprisonment for the crime of Indecent
Assault and ordered
that the sentence be served cumulatively upon the sentence
for Persistent Sexual Abuse, with a non-parole period of four months.
result was a sentence of 12 years and eight months, with a non-parole period of
six years and ten months.
appellant appealed against the convictions and sentence. After a
discussion with counsel at the hearing of the appeal during
which the Court
warned the appellant, in accordance with well-established convention, of its
power if resentencing to increase the
sentence, the appeal against sentence was
abandoned (
Criminal Code Act
1924, s 402(4),
Kentwell v The Queen
[2014] HCA 37
, 252 CLR 601 at
vague grounds relating to conviction were identified in the Notice of Appeal
filed on 6 April 2023, but these were replaced
by an amended Notice filed in May
2024. Leave was given to amend the grounds to read as follows:
substantial miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the Applicant's
counsel at trial to adduce evidence of his good
character in a particular
respect, specifically in respect of the absence of any prior criminal history
for sexual offending.
substantial miscarriage of justice resulted as a consequence of the admission of
evidence that was either irrelevant, inadmissible
and/ or unfairly prejudicial,
including specifically:
(a) uncharged allegations of violence against the complainant [A],
(b) uncharged acts of sexualised communication between the applicant and the
complainant [B]
(c) uncharged allegations of sexual offending against [C]
substantial miscarriage of justice resulted as a consequence of the admission of
tendency evidence in circumstances where:
(a) the evidence contained within the tendency notice was incapable of being
used for a tendency purpose, and/or
(b) the probative value of the evidence said to found the tendency is
substantially outweighed by the danger of its unfair prejudice.
substantial miscarriage of justice occurred as a consequence of the failure of
trial counsel to seek severance of the indictment.
Substantial
miscarriage of jus tice resulted as a consequence of the State's failure to call
relevant and material witnesses."
the reasons that follow I would dismiss the appeal.
and particulars
to s 125A of the
Criminal Code,
the crime of Persistent Sexual Abuse of a
Child required proof that the appellant maintained a sexual relationship with
his daughter,
who at the relevant time was under the age of 17 years and to whom
he was not married. Section 125A(3) provides that an accused is
committing an offence under subs (2) of s 125A if, during the particular period,
"the accused committed an unlawful sexual
act in relation to the young person on
at least three occasions".
s 125A(2) provides that maintaining a sexual relationship with a young person is
a crime, in
Tasmania v RBAY
[2023] TASSC 41
, Pearce J held, correctly in
my view, that maintenance of the relationship is established by proof, without
more, of three unlawful
sexual acts in the relevant period. Unlike other
relationship as an additional element.
the purposes of s 125A(3), the Crown filed a Notice of eleven specified
occasions of unlawful sexual acts relied upon the by
the Crown. These occasions
were set out in a memorandum provided to the jury by the learned trial judge as
part of her Honour's summing
7 Unlawful sexual acts alleged

Before the trial, counsel foreshadowed a severance application and an objection
to the tendency evidence. The matter was sent down
for legal argument in advance
of the trial, but after written submissions were filed by the prosecution,
counsel for the appellant
abandoned the application and objection.
evidence of complainant A was provided to the jury in three parts. First, a
video recorded interview conducted by police on
26 August 2020. Secondly,
through evidence given in the absence of the jury before the learned trial judge
and recorded on 17 and
18 January 2023. A video recording of that evidence was
played to the jury. Thirdly, oral evidence in the presence of the jury on
February 2023.
The evidence of complainant B was contained in a video recorded statement to
police on 26 August 2020 and oral evidence in the presence
of the jury on 21
February 2023.
Complainant A (the appellant's daughter)
told police that the first time the appellant sexually abused her was in her
mother's bed when she was aged 12. It was about a
week after her birthday and
she slept in her mother's bed because her mother and the appellant were
fighting. After her mother went
to work, A was asleep and woke to find the
appellant having sexual intercourse with her. She cried and froze. When the
finished "he just walked out". A said the appellant did not wear a
condom and ejaculated on a towel.
During A's pre-recorded evidence, in re-examination she amended her evidence as
to when the appellant first did sexual things to
her. She said it started when
she was 11. The complainant described being in the shower, after which she
dressed and the appellant
entered the bedroom and touched her vagina under her
clothes. She was crying. A told police the last occasion of sexual abuse
on the Tuesday or Wednesday prior to the police interview.
addition to the 11 specific occasions identified by the trial judge, A gave
evidence of sexual abuse on many other occasions;
most days. She said she
thought it happened over 100 times in her bedroom and her mother's bedroom. The
trial judge told the jury
that such evidence did not relate to the 11 specific
occasions upon which the State relied, and gave directions as to the purpose
the evidence relating to conduct on other occasions ("general evidence"). Those
directions included the following:
"The general evidence has
relevance, of course, but in a specific way and that's why you've heard it. You
can use that evidence to
place the alleged conduct into context. So, according
to the complainant, according to [A] in particular, the acts that are said
have occurred on each of the specified eleven occasions that are relied upon by
the State did not happen out of the blue or in
a vacuum or suddenly just
occurred without any context or against any background.
So the State really assert that there was a pattern of conduct and the
evidence is relevant to your consideration of the context in
which this is said
to have occurred and to enable you to assess whether the crimes that are
specified on those eleven specific occasions
have been proven in a realistic,
contextualised setting.
So, [A] was allowed to give her evidence about what she says the full extent
of the behaviour of her father towards her was. She
was entitled to give it in
that sort of fulsome way, and not be required to artificially edit parts of her
evidence out, because
it's the entire narrative that is relevant to your
assessment of issues such as her credibility."
trial judge continued with directions, drawing a distinction between hearing
background, and evidence
placing these specific occasions within a context of a pattern of conduct. Her
Honour added that it was
relevant to the overall assessment of what occurred and
to the nature of the relationship between father and daughter. The trial
emphasised that the jury could not, and must not, substitute the general
evidence relating to other acts for the evidence of
the specific occasions upon
which the Crown relied.
trial judge gave additional directions concerning the use of the general
evidence of other conduct in relation to tendency reasoning.
That topic is
discussed later in these reasons.
to the evidence of complainant A, additional aspects of her evidence were
summarised in the respondent's written submissions
"During her evidence taken on the special hearing, [A] gave
evidence about general events that had occurred towards the end of the
and in particular, after the accused had been charged and released on bail. She
outlined the following generally:
pre-recorded evidence, the complainant stated there had been two occasions that
the accused had been physically violent
toward her. One occasion was when [B]
was living at the house, and one was after [B] had left. The first occasion
occurred the night
that [B] was ultimately asked to leave the house. During this
argument, the accused grabbed the complainant and slammed her to the
near the fireplace. On an occasion after [B] had left the house, the accused was
'being an asshole' so [A] told him she was
'going to the cops, I'm leaving'. She
was in her bedroom and he grabbed her to the throat and put her on the ground,
and ripped a
bag of clothes apart. She grabbed her shoes and ran to [NW'S]
house, where [B] was living.
accused was charged and bailed, there was continued contact between her and the
appellant during this period (such contact
in the knowledge of at least her
mother). After she spoke to police the first time the accused was meant to be
living at her Nan's.
Nan, Granddad, [AC] and his two children, and her aunt
[KC], lived at that house. She would visit the house; mum would take her and
brothers around, at least every day. They would visit after school and sometimes
stay for tea, and sometimes they would visit
When she'd go to
the house, she'd speak to the accused most times. Sometimes she'd go outside for
a smoke and he'd come out. There,
he would do sexual things to her. This would
happen in the carport usually, and the accused would put his penis into her
When her dad would do things to her at Nan's house, she felt scared and
'like shit, 'cause... he's meant to be there not doing that
shit'. She described
that sometimes she'd pull away from him when he would assault her, but most of
the time she would
"just freeze". She tried to tell
family and a friend of her mother's what was happening but no one would
The sexual abuse
stopped when she was taken out of home by Child Safety Services and she started
living at a shelter.
After she left
and was living in the care of CSS, she spoke with the accused via messages on
her mum's phone. He spoke about not coming
to court, and told her that if she
didn't come to court, he would give her $2000 and a motorbike. Her mum showed
her the message.
In this period
(prior to the abuse stopping), [A] made a handwritten withdrawal statement,
indicating that she had lied to police.
[A] gave the
following evidence about that statement:
that time, she understood that the accused was meant to be living at her Nan's,
but he would return to the family home and
her mum would turn the CCTV cameras
off at the house.
understood that the accused wasn't meant to see her or talk to her but he did
see her and talk to her. She reported to police
that he had been there and
showed them CCTV footage of the accused at her house. The accused sent messages
to her Mum's account and
Mum would show her.
accused would talk to her about what she'd said to police, asking her 'Why' and
telling her he would get locked up. He tried to
put the blame on her and make
her feel bad.
identified the handwritten document as a statement she had written in her
handwriting. When she was at her mother's, her mum,
her uncle [AC] and her aunt
[KC] were standing over her and they were writing it, and she had to do it in
her own handwriting. They'd
done up a rough copy and she had to copy it onto the
statement. This was not long after she'd moved back to her mother's house. She
didn't want to write the document and the contents of the document were not
around the same time her uncle, [AC], took her to a police station. He told
Taneka (Detective Senior Constable Starr) that she
wanted to talk to police
own and [AC] wouldn't allow
that. She didn't want to be there to withdraw her
statement."
cross-examination it was put to complainant A that she had colluded with
complainant B to make false allegations against the
accused. It was put to her
that another person and complainant B had planned it all, and told complainant A
to lie about it. The
motive suggested was a desire to get back at the appellant
for kicking complainant B out of the home of the appellant and complainant
All of these suggestions were denied by complainant A.
Complainant
B, A's cousin, moved into the appellant's home for a period in mid-2020. During
this time complainant A disclosed to
complainant B that her father had been
sexually abusing her. This disclosure was made after B disclosed to A that she
had been indecently
assaulted by the appellant.
Subsequently,
A ran away from home and disclosed the sexual abuse to a number of friends and
August 2020 complainant A was made subject of a mental health order taken out by
her mother. When a police officer attempted
to execute the mental health order
on 25 August 2020, he was informed by two persons that A had made a complaint of
sexual assault.
While being transported to hospital, A said to the police
officer "does the hospital know what my Dad did to me". At the hospital
complaint of sexual abuse to a nurse and a doctor. A medical examination
provided no clear indication one way or the other
as to whether sexual
penetration had occurred. The Crown submissions contend that during the medical
examination, A gave a history
"generally consistent with her evidence".
Arrangements
were made for complainant A to speak to the police and she participated in a
video recorded interview the following
the Crown case, complainant A's evidence was supported in a number of respects.
The Crown's written submissions summarised other
evidence in the following
"(g) The complainant's evidence at trial was further
supported by forensic evidence. The evidence of Detective Senior Constable
Starr was that, following her video statement, [A] disclosed to her that
on one occasion, the accused had ejaculated onto a rug at
the foot of her bed. A
and tested, in addition to other
items. Ana Flonta and Dr Corey Griffiths of
Forensic Science Service Tasmania gave evidence of the results of forensic
items seized from [A's] bedroom:
Ana Flonta gave
evidence that an area of [A's] bedroom rug, which had tested positive with a
screening test for semen, was further
tested at FSST. The results of the test
showed a 4+ result for spermatozoa, the highest level of detection for
spermatozoa used.
Griffith gave evidence of DNA testing. The semen positive area of the floral rug
returned a male DNA profile that was a high
grade match to the accused. Only
male DNA was located on the rug.
(h) An explanation for this forensic evidence was put to the complainant under
cross-examination. It was suggested to [A] that she
retrieved a "sex towel" from
her mother and father's bedroom, and rubbed it onto the mat in her bedroom, and
that's how the accused's
semen came to be on her mat. [A] denied this, saying,
'Why would I want to touch that?' It was suggested to [A] that she had been
present when her mother had said to her, 'Don't touch that towel, that's our sex
towel'. [A] denied that this conversation had occurred.
(i) Detective Senior Constable Taneka Starr further gave evidence that when the
accused learned of the allegations and that Police
were investigating the
matter, he told his wife that he could not come back to the house to prove his
innocence and subsequently
went missing for a period of time. Police were
initially concerned for his welfare and a search operation was conducted. After
approximately
24 hours he made contact with Police through his brother, [AC],
and indicated that he would present himself to Police for interview.
relied upon by the Crown as post offence conduct indicative of guilt.
(j) Detective Senior Constable Starr, gave further evidence that during the
course of her investigation, she seized and examined
some CCTV footage from the
family home. Specifically she reviewed footage captured during the period of
time the appellant was on
bail after being charged. She gave evidence that on
her observations, the footage depicted the appellant present and interacting
numerous occasions with [A] at the family home during this period. During these
occasions, [A's] mother was also present.
(k) The appellant's mother gave evidence that during the period after the
appellant was charged and on bail, he lived with her. During
this time, [A]
attended the house with her mother and interacted with the appellant.
(l) Detective Starr gave evidence that on the 21st of October 2020, the
complainant attended the Police station with [AC]. [AC] demanded
Detective take a withdrawal statement from the complainant and stated that [A]
wanted the charges to be dropped. [A] did
not speak at all during the
interaction. Detective Starr asked to speak to [A] alone but [AC] became
agitated and refused to allow
this to occur. Detective Starr explained that such
a statement would not be taken under these circumstances. After this [AC] and
[A] left the station without a statement being taken.
(m) The appellant's wife, [NW] gave evidence. In relation to count 1 she
She confirmed
that while [B] lived at the family home, [B] and [A] had a very close
relationship.
She stated that
[B] was a bad influence on [A] and was 'sending her down the wrong path'. She
was getting [A] into a lot of trouble.
As a result, a decision was made that [B]
had to move out.
She stated that
when [B] was kicked out of the house, [A] 'acted up' and didn't want [B] 'to
evidence about the day [B] was asked to leave her house. [NW] and the accused
asked [B] to leave and an argument occurred.
[NW] filmed some of this
cross-examination by the appellant's trial counsel, she denied that the
appellant choked the complainant during this argument.
She stated that she had
never observed the appellant be physically violent to any of the children.
In relation to
the incident at the Health Glo pool (Occasion 4), [NW] gave evidence that she
got out of the pool first and went to
have a shower. At the time she got out,
all of the children and the appellant were still in the pool. She stated that
[A] came into
the change rooms approximately 2 minutes after her and had a
shower in the cubicle next to hers. She stated that [EG] then came into
change rooms another few minutes later.
She confirmed
other surrounding circumstances of the offending, such as the fact the
complainant went wood chopping with the accused
and the fact that after the
accused was charged and bailed to not have contact with the complainant, he
returned to the family house
during this period. Under cross examination by
Crown counsel, she denied that there were times during this period when the
had contact with [A] at the family home or at his mother's house when he
lived there.
[NW] stated in
her evidence that she and the accused had sex both in their bedroom and at
times, in [A's] bedroom. She said this occurred
at times when [A] was sick and
asleep in their bed.
evidence that she kept a towel to use to wipe up ejaculation and other fluids
after she and the appellant had sex. She stated
that she had told [A] not to
touch her 'sex towel' before. All of the children were aware of the existence of
the sex towel.
evidence that [A] was 'always asking for money'.
She denied being
present when [A] wrote her withdrawal statement. She denied the suggestion that
she had been part of a group forcing
her to do this.
During cross
examination by Crown counsel, it was suggested that [NW] had reviewed the
evidence that had been disclosed to the appellant
and had tailored her evidence
to be favourable to the appellant. This was denied by [NW], although she
admitted to having had access
to some of the evidence prior to appearing as a

pool. He said that his mother and [A] got out

challenged under cross examination by Crown counsel but [BC] maintained that his

of the pool first. Despite this, he admitted to not
recalling anything else that happened at the pool that day.

evidence that at the Health Glo pool, [A] and their mother got out of the pool
first. He stated that the appellant and the
rest of the children stayed in the
pool for another 15 minutes. Under cross examination by Crown counsel it was
suggested to the
witness that there were lots of times they attended the pool.
The witness disagreed with this, saying it was just the one time. It
suggested to him that he actually couldn't recall who got out of the pool first
and that he was saying it was his mum and [A]
so that his Dad didn't get into
trouble. [DC] denied this."
Complainant B
complainant B is described as the niece of the appellant, that description was
used on the basis that the appellant's brother
was the former step-father of B.
As mentioned, B lived with the appellant and his family for a period in mid-2020
when she was aged
Crown submissions summarised the evidence of complainant B as
"(a) [B] is the niece by marriage of the accused (her
former step-father was the accused's brother, [AC]). She lived with the accused
and his family for a period of time in mid-2020 when she was 15 years old.
(b) [B's] evidence was presented at trial in the form of a video statement with
police, in addition to evidence given via video link
(c) [B] participated in a video recorded statement with police on 26 August
2020, in which she described the following:
Before living
with the accused, he had sent her messages asking if she masturbated. These made
her feel uncomfortable and she "blocked"
After she had
come to live with the accused, about a month later, she was in [A's] bedroom.
The accused came into the bedroom and
sat on the bed. He pushed her down onto

She was rolling
around the bed trying to get away from him. He tried to kiss her neck and was
trying to touch her underneath her pants.
She heard the
accused's youngest son, [BC], come home and yell out to his dad. The accused got
up and [B] yelled for [BC] to come
into the room, and the accused walked out.
When the accused
got up to leave, he told her not to tell [A].
This occurred on
a weekday because she was suspended from school, on a Friday. [NW] wasn't
present, she was working.
That night, [B]
told [A], and [A] told her about what the accused had done to her. [A] asked
her, 'did Dad do something', and [B]
said, 'Why would you think that?'
[A] started to
cry, and told her that the accused had been touching her, describing some of the

incident, on the following Monday, she left the house. There was a massive
argument, some of which she had recorded
on her phone.

that the allegations she had made in her police interview were true.
The message

[B] described
incidents with the [family] that occurred after she spoke with police, including
having been assaulted by [AC] and [KC]
outside the accused's home in October
She described
witnessing the accused hug [C] when she would attend the house. She said it
would be a longer than normal hug.
(e) Under cross-examination of
[B], the following occurred:
It was suggested
to [B] that the messages relating to masturbation were part of a mutual
'secret-sharing' exercise that she and the
accused were undertaking. [B] denied
this was the case.
cross-examination focussed on her behavioural issues at her grandparents' house
and at school around the time of the alleged
offending, which generally [B]
accepted had occurred.
It was put to
[B] that she was 'not happy' with the appellant when she left the appellant's
house as he had ended their confidential
relationship. She was 'crabby' with him
for kicking her out. [B] agreed that she wasn't happy with the appellant but it
was because
of what he had done (i.e. the indecent assault).
It was put to
her that she had lied about the allegations because she was 'crabby' with him
for asking her to leave his house. This
was denied by [B].
It was put to
[B] that she and [A] had 'put [their] heads together' to make up the story
against the accused, which she denied."
Complainant
B spoke to a number of people alleging sexual assault by the appellant. One of
those witnesses (C) gave evidence that
complainant B told her the appellant had
kissed her. In cross-examination of a family friend of the witness and the
witness's mother,

concocting the allegations and in influencing complainant A to adopt the false
allegations. The family friend denied the suggestion.

as "tendency evidence". In addition to the evidence
of the charged acts, coupled
with the Crown case of other sexualised conduct toward both complainants, the
Crown relied upon the
evidence of C that the appellant committed sexually
inappropriate acts upon her. At the relevant time C was of a similar age to
complainant A and lived next door to complainant A and the appellant. The Crown
submissions summarised the evidence of

appellant was interviewed by police on three occasions. Those interviews were
played to the jury. The Crown submissions summarised
features of those
interviews as follows:
"36 The first interview was conducted on the
of August 2020. This interview concerned the original
allegations of [A], the allegations of [B] and the allegations of [C]. Of
note, during the interview the accused stated:
(a) In relation to [A]:
When asked about
his relationship with his children he said 'Ah fine. I love my kids'.
He has slept in
[A]'s room at times when she was sick and slept in with her mother.
He has had sex
with [NW] in [A]'s bed. It happened on the end of the bed and he didn't wear a
condom. He thinks [A] was at a friend's
house when this happened. He can't
remember how many times this has happened. On one of these times his ejaculate
may have dripped
on the floor. [A] has never seen him ejaculate in her room.
allegations of sexual abuse that had been made by [A] were put to him, the
appellant denied them and said they were not true.
In relation to
the allegation concerning conduct that occurred in the bush when they were
woodcutting, the accused said that it wasn't
true and that Police could ask 'the
others, we're always together cutting'.
In relation to
the allegation concerning the conduct at the Health Glo pool, the appellant said
that he had only been to the pool
with the family once. He agreed that all of
the family along with one of [A]'s friends were there. He said he thinks they
out of the pool together. He remembered getting out when the boys got
out. He denied the alleged conduct occurred.
He denied ever
being physical with [A] during an argument. He denied ever hitting any of his

Sometimes she
would message him about it and sometimes they would sit down and talk.
He admitted to
deleting some messages [B] had sent him and asking her to delete messages he had
sent her. He deleted messages because
she asked him to. She didn't want people
seeing what she was talking to him about and he did it so she would trust him.
He was trying
to be a father figure to her.
He denied ever
messaging her anything inappropriate.
He admitted
messaging her about masturbation but said he meant nothing by that. He was
trying to build trust with her and asked her
to tell him something that no one
else knew. He then said 'maybe you masturbate' as a joke. It was only meant as a
allegation of sexual abuse was put to him he denied it occurring.
He denied being
sexually attracted to [B].

her in any way. She had her clothes on
when he did this.
allegations concerning [C] were put to him, the appellant denied they
second interview was conducted on the 3
of November 2020. This
interview concerned allegations that during the period after the accused had
been charged, he had breached
his bail numerous times by approaching [A]. Of
particular note, during the interview the accused stated:
(a) The accused confirmed he had been living at his mother's house while on bail
but had returned to the family home from time to
(b) He stated that when he returned, arrangements were made so that [A] would
not be there. She would stay at her grandmother's house.
parts of the CCTV footage from the house were then shown to him, he admitted to
at times being in [A]'s presence but denied
ever talking to her for extended
periods or staying overnight at the house while she was there.
third interview was conducted on the 18th of November 2021. This interview
concerned the further allegations made by [A] of continued
sexual abuse
occurring after the appellant had been charged and bailed initially. Of
particular note, during the interview the accused
(a) Generally speaking, throughout the interview the appellant denied
approaching [A] in breach of his bail and denied all of the
allegations of
continued sexual abuse.
(b) He asserted that [A] had requested money from him and when he refused, she
had threatened to get him charged again.
(c) At the end of the interview, the appellant urged Police to go and talk to
his mother, his wife and to [AC] and [KC]."
Incompetence of counsel
number of the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant are closely aligned
with an assertion that trial counsel failed to object
to evidence, or lead
evidence, to the point where the conduct of counsel at trial was incompetent and
resulted in a substantial miscarriage
of justice. For the reasons that follow, I
do not agree with that contention. However, it is appropriate to canvass briefly
the relevant
principles concerning the relevance of the conduct of counsel to
the question of a fair trial and miscarriage of justice.
authorities are clear that the ultimate question is whether the conduct of
counsel has given rise to a miscarriage of justice.
However, as Gleeson CJ
pointed out in
(1990) 19 NSWRL 677, it is difficult to find in
the authorities "a formula which adequately and accurately defines the class of
in which a Court of Criminal Appeal will intervene." After general
observations that to a "large extent" the parties are bound by
the manner in
which counsel conduct a trial, and that counsel possesses a "wide discretion as
to the manner in which proceedings
are conducted", his Honour summarised
relevant principles at 683-685:
"1 A Court of Criminal Appeal has a
power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what
amounts to a miscarriage
of justice is something that has to be considered in
the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates.
a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by
counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance
with the wishes of the
client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions
made by counsel were made without,
or contrary to, instructions, or involve
errors of judgment or even negligence.
there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial,
perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence'
of counsel, or perhaps from
some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a
miscarriage of justice. It is
impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define
such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate
intervention."
principles have been discussed in numerous authorities including
[2021] HCA 33
where the majority identified the importance of a
rational decision by defence counsel [49]:
"A rational decision by
defence counsel as to the conduct of a criminal trial that can be seen to have
been a legitimate forensic
choice that competent counsel could fairly make will
not give rise to a miscarriage of justice within s 6(1) of
Criminal Appeal Act
The adversarial system does justice
through the diligent exertions of competent counsel in coming to grips with the
special circumstances
of the particular case." (Footnote omitted.)

Porter AJ helpfully
summarised the relevant principles [63] and [64]:
"[63] The proper
approach to cases in which a miscarriage of justice is alleged to have arisen
from the incompetence of counsel has
been explained by the High Court

[64] The following propositions emerge:
Incompetence of
counsel is not of itself a ground of appeal, the relevant ground is whether
there was a miscarriage of justice as
referred to in s 402(1) of
Criminal Code
per Gleeson CJ at [2].
The concept of a
miscarriage of justice has two relevant aspects; outcome and process –
different but related in the sense that
due process is to secure a just result.
A failure of process that departs from the essential requirements of a fair
trial is a miscarriage
of justice:
per McHugh J at
at [3]-[7] per Gleeson CJ.
If there has not
been a fair trial according to law, that will give rise to a miscarriage of
justice without regard to whether counsel's
conduct might have affected the
per McHugh J at [76];
[3]-[7] per Gleeson CJ.
In other cases
– perhaps the majority – irregular conduct of counsel will not
deprive a person of a fair trial. In such
circumstances, the ultimate question
of whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred raises two issues; did
counsel's conduct result
in a material irregularity in the trial, and is there a
significant possibility the irregularity affected the
per McHugh J at [79];
Gummow and Hayne JJ at [24].
In a case of
that kind, the enquiry is an objective one; the question is whether so viewed,
the course taken by counsel was capable
of rational justification or
explanation:
per Gleeson CJ at [16], Gaudron J at
[26]-[27], McHugh J at [95], Hayne J at [107];
per Gleeson
CJ at [9], [16], per Callinan and Heydon JJ at [158].
applicant contends that the conduct of counsel has caused a criminal trial to
miscarry, he or she carries a heavy burden:
per McHugh J
at [74]. As a general rule, counsels' decisions bind the client; the party
is held to the way in which counsel presented
per McHugh J at [79];
Gleeson CJ at [9]. This is so even if decisions were made without or contrary to
instructions, or involve errors of judgment
negligence:
per McHugh J at [79].
Describing trial
counsel's conduct as 'incompetent' – with or without some emphatic term
like 'flagrantly' – must not
distract attention from the question of
whether there was a miscarriage of justice. That requires a consideration of
what did or
did not occur at the trial, not why that situation came about. The
question does not turn on adjectival classifications of
competence.
per Gaudron J at [31], per McHugh J at [75],
per Hayne J (with whom Gummow J agreed) at [103];
Gleeson CJ at [8], per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [24]-[27].
however, a decision about whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred requires
an understanding of the circumstances;
this may involve an understanding about
why something happened:
per Gleeson CJ at
Ground 1 – Failure to adduce evidence of good
Ground 1 complains that a substantial miscarriage of justice resulted from the
failure of the appellant's counsel to adduce evidence
of his good character "in
a particular respect, specifically in respect of the absence of any prior
criminal history for sexual offending".
This claim is advanced notwithstanding
that the appellant has a significant history of prior offending, particularly in
to offences of dishonesty, dating from 1991 when the appellant was aged
13 years. His last offence was committed on 9 January 2010
when he was aged
In summary, the appellant's written submissions advance the following
contentions:
circumstances of the instant case, while it is accepted that the Applicant did
have a criminal history, it is submitted that
the Applicant was entitled to rely
on evidence of his good character
in a particular respect
the absence of any criminal history in respect of sexual offending or violence.
That could have been done either through
cross-examination of the Informant
and/or through the calling of witnesses about the Applicant's general reputation
on these issues.
Neither of these things were done in this case."
circumstances of this case, where the case was almost entirely word against
word, evidence led that the accused had no criminal
history for sexual or
violent offending would have been powerful factors for the jury's consideration.
It had the capacity to impact
an assessment by the jury of the denials made by
the Applicant in his Record of Interview, as well as an assessment of each of
complainant's credibility and reliability."
circumstances of this case, it is submitted that there can be no rational
justification for failing to either adduce evidence
from the Informant about the
Applicant's lack of criminal history in those two specific respects, or seek to
adduce evidence from
witnesses as to the Applicant's general character –
and specifically his engagement and treatment of children and their observations
of any violence."
The ultimate submission advanced by the appellant is that counsel's failure to
adduce the evidence amounted to incompetency in the
conduct of the trial and
produced both an unfair trial and a substantial miscarriage of justice.

[2014] VSCA 7
, 45 VR 440, Weinberg JA delivered
a judgment with which Priest and Coghlan JJA agreed, in which his Honour

provisions identical to those found in the Tasmanian
Evidence Act
the appellant was charged with sexual offences against children
and counsel sought a ruling in advance as to whether the Crown would
permitted to lead rebuttal evidence if the accused led evidence of an absence of
prior convictions. Although the evidence proposed
in rebuttal by the Crown was
not admissible, the threat by the prosecutor with respect to rebuttal evidence
caused defence counsel
to refrain from leading such evidence. In addition, the
trial judge erred in ruling that the proposed rebuttal evidence was likely
Weinberg JA observed that at common law "there was no such thing as putting
one's character partly in issue" [46]. His Honour noted
that unlike the position
at common law, "character is no longer treated as 'indivisible'". His Honour
pointed out that under
, "the accused can lead evidence to show that he or
she is a person of good character generally, or a person of good character 'in
particular respect'" [57].
After considering the extensive exchanges between counsel and the trial judge,
Weinberg JA observed that "in one sense, the decision
not to call evidence of
good character involved a forensic choice on the part of the applicant's
counsel." [92]. His Honour's reasons
"However, it was a
choice that was heavily influenced by what seems to have been a misapprehension
on the part of the judge as to
how the law in this area should be correctly
applied. In those circumstances, I would not treat that choice as either having
freely made or as barring this appeal from succeeding."
Weinberg JA's ultimate conclusion that the appellant was denied a fair trial
was expressed in the following terms:
"[89] The applicant was
entitled to be tried fairly and according to law. He was entitled to have the
jury told that he had no prior
convictions of any kind provided, of course, that
this could be done in a way which was not misleading. Had his counsel simply
from the informant the fact that the applicant had no convictions of
any kind, save for these particular traffic matters, there was
no risk of the
jury being, in any relevant sense, misled.
[90] As it happened, the applicant was denied both the benefit of good
character evidence, and the advantage, to which he was entitled,
accompanying good character directions. He was entitled as a matter of law, to
adduce evidence that would have ensured that
the jury was aware that he had no
convictions of any kind save for traffic matters. The jury would then have been
aware that he
was not a known paedophile, and that it was not suggested that he
had ever previously committed offences against children."
(1996) 86 A Crim R 41
, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal
was concerned with convictions for sexual intercourse with the appellant's
when she was under 10 years of age and when between 10 and 16 years.
Although counsel for the appellant at trial had elicited from
the officer in
charge of the investigation that the appellant had no criminal record, and the
appellant in evidence had "put himself
forward as a person of good character",
counsel had failed to call a number of witnesses who were able to give direct
evidence as
to the appellant's character. Hunt CJ at CL, with whose judgment
Grove, JA and Barr AJ agreed, summarised the extensive and powerful
evidence which should have been placed before the jury (42):
evidence which these witnesses could have given has been put in affidavit form.
For example, his local priest speaks of the appellant's
regular attendance at
Mass, the help which has given when work was to be done for the church, his
honesty and trustworthiness as
a man whose word could always be accepted and his
good relationship with his children. The priest concludes by saying that, when
he found out about the charges against the appellant, he was surprised because
he does not believe that he is 'the sort of person'
who would cause such harm to
a young child. The former sheriff's officer in the district in which the
appellant lived speaks of knowing
him for over 30 years, the high esteem in
which he is held in the community, his good relationship with his children, his
beliefs, his trustworthiness and the assistance which he has on
numerous occasions voluntarily given to other members of the community.
sheriff's officer says that he is fully aware of the charges against the
appellant and does not believe that he is capable of
committing the acts
alleged. There is evidence of a similar nature from others who have known the
appellant for substantial periods
both socially and by way of business, and
there is evidence from his sister who gives considerable detail of his good
relationship
with his children."
Hunt CJ at CL pointed out that good character evidence can be of "substantial
benefit" to an accused. His Honour's reasons continued
demonstrate that it is unlikely that, as a person of good character, he or she
would have done the act charged. It may also
support the credibility of the
evidence of the accused denying guilt and hence the unlikelihood of his or her
There is a vast difference in the likely effect upon a jury
between the basic type of evidence which was in fact elicited at this
the further evidence which was available and to which I have referred;
the jury is entitled to and may well in fact give greater weight to the
evidence of witnesses who are able to speak directly to the
good character of
the accused than to evidence of the bare nature elicited in this case.
(Footnotes omitted.)(My emphasis.)
The point of distinction made by Hunt CJ between positive evidence of good
character, and the mere absence of convictions, is important.
No evidence has
been placed before this Court suggesting positive evidence of good character was
available to the appellant at trial.
In sentencing submissions following the
verdicts of guilty trial counsel for the appellant did not make any submissions
or indirectly implying that positive evidence of good character
The critical circumstances in
were similar to those with which the
Victorian Court of Appeal was concerned in
Sharma v The Queen
[2011] VSCA
In the context of an existing relationship involving prior acts of
consensual sexual intercourse, the appellant was charged with
rape and other
sexual assaults. Counsel for the appellant had asked an investigating police
officer whether he was aware that the
appellant had no prior offences. The
officer responded by stating he could not comment and did not know. The matter
of prior convictions
was not clarified and no character evidence was led.
extensive character evidence was led following conviction.
The judgment summarised that evidence:
"25 At the plea hearing,
defence counsel called extensive evidence of the applicant's good character. At
the time of offending, the
applicant was a medical practitioner in general
practice in Bendigo. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of
Practitioners. He had no prior convictions.
character references were provided by eight general practitioners or
specialists. Other written references were provided by
two medical
receptionists, a medical practice manager, the Chief Executive Officer
of an aged care facility, six of the applicant's
patients and his
fiancée. Most of the referees said they were aware of the charges against
the applicant and that he had fine
personal qualities and was a caring
Moore and two of the applicant's patients, Mr Adrian Pilchard and Mrs Lee
Pickering, gave evidence at the plea. All of them said
that they maintained a
high opinion of the applicant despite his conviction.
his sentencing remarks, the learned sentencing judge noted that there was
'powerful evidence' as to the applicant's 'professional
standing and reputation'
in the Bendigo area."(Footnotes omitted.)
The appellate court observed that counsel for the appellant should not have
left the matter with the answer given by the investigating
police officer that
he did not know whether the appellant had prior convictions. The court described
the character evidence which
could have been led as "powerful", and noted that
each of the witnesses called to give good character evidence in relation to
continued to hold the appellant in high regard despite knowledge of the
offences of which the appellant had been convicted. Although
the court regarded
the case as "very close to the line", ultimately it reached the conclusion that
the failure to remove the negative
impression caused by the evidence of the
police officer, "coupled with the failure to call good character evidence",
deprived the
appellant of a chance of acquittal. The court concluded that had
the evidence been led, some members of the jury might not have been
that the appellant did not possess an honest and reasonable belief that the
complainant was consenting and, therefore,
the failure to lead the evidence
resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice.
Again, the positive good character evidence which counsel for the appellant in
failed to lead was "powerful". It would have required a direction
not only that the evidence went to the credibility of the appellant's
but also to the likelihood of him committing the offences charged (a full good
character direction).
The circumstances under consideration are markedly different. The mere absence
of prior convictions for sexual offences or violence,
without more, would have
had minimal impact. Further, the trial judge would have faced a difficult task
in fashioning an appropriate
direction for the jury. At the time of trial, the
appellant possessed an extensive record of prior convictions for substantial
dishonesty,
coupled with repeated failures to respond to court orders and a
failure to rehabilitate. In these circumstances, it would not have
appropriate for the trial judge to give a full character direction.
submissions on the appeal proceeded on the basis that if the appellant led
evidence as to the absence of any prior sexual offending
or offences of
violence, in rebuttal the Crown would have sought to place before the jury the
appellant's lengthy record of substantial
dishonesty and failure to comply with
court orders. The submissions assumed that, almost inevitably, the trial judge
would have granted
leave to the Crown to lead such evidence. Based as they were
on the common law position that character was treated as "indivisible",
assumptions were misplaced.
discussed earlier in these reasons, as a consequence of
an accused is entitled to lead evidence that he is a person of good
character "in a particular respect". Persuasive authority establishes
evidence of good character is limited to a particular respect, such as the
absence of prior sexual offending, evidence in
rebuttal is limited to such
particular respect and the Crown is not entitled to lead evidence of other types
of offending of an entirely
different character from the particular
principle, I agree that where an accused places before the jury the absence of
prior offending in a particular respect, if allowed
in the exercise of the
discretion, rebuttal evidence would be limited accordingly. It is unnecessary
to discuss the parameters of
In the matter under
consideration, therefore, if the appellant led evidence as to the absence of
prior offending of a sexual nature
or involving violence, evidence in rebuttal
would necessarily have been limited to those matters and the Crown would not
entitled to lead evidence of the appellant's prior offences of
dishonesty and breaches of court orders.
appellant's written submissions in support of ground 1 assert that the conduct
of counsel for the appellant at trial was incompetent
because there was "no
rational justification for failing to either adduce evidence from the Informant
of criminal history in those two specific respects,
or seek to adduce evidence from witnesses as to the Applicant's general
– and specifically his engagement and treatment of children and
their observations of any violence." These bald assertions
concerning evidence
of general character and treatment of children were not supported by any
material before this Court that such
evidence was available at trial. As
mentioned, there was no attempt by trial counsel to place such material before
the trial judge
for the purposes of sentencing.
evidence was provided as to whether counsel did, or did not, consider calling
character evidence to the limited extent of establishing
that the appellant did
not have any prior convictions for offences of a sexual nature or involving
violence. No evidence has been
provided as to whether any instructions were
sought or given in this regard.
It is readily apparent that counsel at trial could reasonably have made a
legitimate forensic choice not to open up the question
of the appellant's
character, even to the limited extent concerning the absence of prior sexual
offending or any offences of violence.
In the circumstances under
consideration, the absence of prior offending of a sexual nature, or involving
violence, was likely to
be regarded by the jury as neutral in its effect.
Counsel might have held a legitimate concern that leading such limited evidence
might have tempted a jury to speculate as to why the evidence was limited to the
absence of prior sexual offending and violence.
danger of speculation should such limited evidence have been led was real.
Counsel for the Crown would have been entitled to
comment that the absence of
prior sexual offending meant little in the particular circumstances where the
offending occurred in the
domestic setting. Counsel for the appellant would have
been obliged to choose words very carefully in addressing the jury, necessarily
avoiding an implication that the appellant was a person of "good character".
Depending on how the issue was approached by both counsel,
the trial judge might
have chosen to say nothing about the topic or to have given some form of
direction appropriate to the circumstances.
Such a direction might have included
reference to the domestic setting. For this Court, it is matter of conjecture
because of the
variety of circumstances that might have faced the trial
to the contention, unsupported by identification of the proposed evidence, that
evidence concerning "general character" could
have been led, trial counsel would
have been most unwise to embark upon such a dangerous path. Inevitably, the
trial judge would
have permitted the Crown to lead evidence of the appellant's
prior record of offending because such record would have been directly
to a suggestion that the appellant was of good general character. If evidence
of the appellant's prior record of offending
had been placed before the jury, it
would have significantly damaged the credibility of the appellant's denials
during a police interview
and his explanations for both the DNA evidence and his
breach of bail.
these reasons, in my view the appellant has failed to make out the underlying
contention that the failure of trial counsel to
adduce the evidence in question
amounted to incompetency in the conduct of the trial. Put another way, a
legitimate choice having
been made, there was no blemish in the trial,
particularly no blemish resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Further, even it
regarded as an error not to lead the evidence, for the reasons discussed, in
my view the appellant did not lose a chance fairly open
to him of being
these reasons, ground 1 is not made out.
tendency evidence
It is convenient to deal with ground 3 concerning the admission of tendency
evidence before discussing the complaints in ground
2. The appellant asserts
that the admission of the tendency evidence caused a substantial miscarriage of
justice as:
"(a) the evidence contained within the Tendency Notice
was incapable of being used for a tendency purpose, and/or
(b) the probative value of the evidence said to found the tendency is
substantially outweighed by the danger of its unfair prejudice."
The appellant's written submission advanced the proposition that the tendency
evidence upon which the prosecution sought to rely
"was not relevantly tendency
evidence". The submission drew attention to specific particulars in the Tendency
Notice, describing
the particulars as "merely recitation of complaint by the
complainants." The written submission continued:
"Put simply, the
complaints made (for example) by [complainant A] to other people about the
allegations do not disclose a tendency
in the Applicant to offend in the way
asserted. The evidence of those witnesses is relevant for the jury's assessment
of the consistency
(or otherwise) of her complaint. It is relevant for an
assessment of the complainant of her credibility and reliability. But her
repeated complaints do not impact upon whether (or not) the Accused had the
asserted tendency. Put another way, evidence by several
witnesses of what the
complainant told them does not demonstrate a tendency. It does not render it
more likely than not that the
act occurred and that the Applicant had offended
against her."
ground of appeal is misconceived. It is correct that the Tendency Notice
contained reference to the complaints made by the
complainants and C, but it
also contained reference to the evidence to be given by the complainants and C,
which evidence the Crown
relied upon to establish both the tendency and the
willingness to act on the tendency. In addition, the complaints were admissible
as evidence of the truth of the conduct about which the complainants spoke
Evidence Act
Tendency Notice contained appropriate details of the evidence upon which the
Crown intended to rely to establish the tendency
and a willingness to act upon
it. The Notice appropriately identified other evidence, in the form of
complaints, upon which the Crown
relied as evidence supporting the witnesses who
were to give evidence of the sexual conduct of the appellant from which the jury
would be invited to infer the existence of the tendency and a willingness to act
any event, it is not the terms of the Notice which are relevant to an assessment
of the probative value of the tendency evidence.
It is the evidence itself and
the directions of the trial judge as to the use of the evidence.
addition to the directions earlier cited with respect to the use of "general
evidence" of sexual assaults in addition to the specific
occasions relied upon,
in the context of specifically discussing tendency evidence, the trial judge
gave comprehensive and appropriate
directions as to the use of the "general
evidence" in support of the prosecution case that the appellant possessed
particular tendencies
and acted on them:
Honour's directions were as follows:
"Having said that, there is
another way in which you can also use this general evidence, and it's relevant
to this tendency reasoning
that Ms Pennington spoke to you about, so I'm going
to go there now. Now, the Crown – the State say the accused had a
tendency. Now, what's a tendency? A tendency is simply a propensity
or a habit to act or think in particular ways. It's nothing more
than that. We
all have tendencies. I have no doubt you can recognise them in yourself.
But here, the prosecution say that the accused has particular tendencies and
they are relevant to your assessment of events in a specific
way. So, the
tendencies which are asserted by the prosecution to be established by the
evidence is for the accused to have a sexual
interest and/or engage in sexual
They say that tendency displays itself because he sexually assaults female
children to whom he is related, by birth or otherwise;
he sexually assaults
female children in respect of whom he is in a position of being a parent or
guardian, or which children are
under his care or supervision; he sexually
assaults female children in circumstances where those children are removed from
the immediate
presence of other adults; he sexually assaults female children
whilst those children were present in his place of residence and/or
in his care;
or he sexually assaults female children at his residence, or other locations
when there was a risk of detection by other
So, as a general rule – and I've set this out at paragraph 8 – as
a general rule, evidence of general conduct can't be
used to find specific
occasions, and it can only be used in that context sort of setting, and evidence
of one crime must be ignored
when considering whether the person has committed
another crime. But here, some slightly different rules apply.
You can use the evidence that [A] gave about the general sexual assaults that
she alleges the accused perpetrated upon her. You can
use the evidence [A] gave
You can use the evidence [TR] gave about the incidents that occurred to her,
and you can use the evidence that [C] gave about what
[C] said occurred to her
in making your assessment as to whether or not you're satisfied the accused had
a particular tendency. That
is, the accused had a sexual interest in female
children and a tendency to act upon that sexual interest in one of the ways I've
set out at paragraph 8.3.
So, that's what the State say was occurring here. The State say the accused
had this tendency and that tendency perpetuated itself,
showed itself by him
doing those behaviours. So, the prosecution rely upon the evidence given by [A],
by [B] and as I say, by [C],
together with the evidence you've hear about what
each of those persons said to other persons at various times to establish that
the accused does, in fact, possess that tendency or those tendencies.
Now, if you accept the evidence about that conduct – so, the first
point is you have to accept that something actually happened,
of course. The
next question you must consider is whether the evidence that you have heard
establishes some or all of the alleged
tendencies. So that's the first question.
Does the evidence establish that the accused has those tendencies? Are you
satisfied he
has those tendencies?
So, the question for you is whether on the whole of the evidence you are
satisfied that the accused has one or all of the asserted
tendencies and that he
had the tendency at the time the commission of the crime is said to have
occurred. So, you don't have to be
satisfied, you do not have to be satisfied
that every act, that every piece of conduct is an example of this tendency, but
have to be satisfied after examining all of the relevant evidence that
the tendency existed at the time in question, and you make
this decision as an
inference drawn from the accused's conduct.
So, this comes back to this inferential reasoning that I was telling you
and this is how
it displays itself. You're being asked to infer that he possesses this tendency
from all of the evidence that the
State's put before you. So, the evidence of
[A], [B] and [C], because you'll recall [C] gave evidence of the accused having
behaved towards her in a way that the State say is consistent with him
having this tendency.
So, I remind you, you should examine the asserted inference to ensure it's a
rational and justified inference. You should consider
other possible
explanations. The accused, of course says look, none of this ever happened; this
is, in effect, all a conspiracy that
[A] and [B] have got together, have made
this up and by inference, [C] joined in to support them.
So if, of course, you are not satisfied that the conduct actually occurred,
you could not possibly find that the accused had one or
all of the asserted
tendency and all of that is a matter for you to determine. You should exercise
care when determining whether
you can infer the existence of the tendencies from
the evidence but if you are satisfied that the tendency existed, you are
to proceed on that basis.
If you are not satisfied of the existence of the particular tendency , or any
of the tendencies, then you must ignore the general
evidence of the acts and the
background evidence, the context evidence, and use it only in the sense that
I've referred to, putting
things into context, making it part of the
If you are not satisfied of the existence of this tendency, of this
particular tendency, you also must ignore the evidence of what
[A] said occurred
to her when considering the count in respect to [B] and vice versa, you must
ignore what [B] said happened to her
when considering the case in respect to
So, if you're satisfied the tendency occurred, you can use it as evidence
that he had the tendency, and that it's more likely, you
might consider, that he
committed the crimes in question. So, if you're satisfied he had the tendency,
you can use the existence
of the tendency to consider whether it's more likely
that he committed the crimes in question, but if you're not satisfied he had
tendency, you've got to separate it all out and consider [A] completely
separately from [B].
All right. The crossover occurs in your consideration of whether or not he
had the tendency. If you're not satisfied he did, separate
If you are satisfied he possessed the tendency, then you can use it to
consider whether it's more likely he committed the crime under
consideration. It
is important to remember, however , that the existence of a tendency cannot, as
and by itself, prove the crime
or prove the specified occasion. Just because
someone has a particular tendency to act in a particular way does not
automatically
or inevitably mean that they have acted in that way or committed
the crime on the occasion in question. All right.
The prosecution obviously argues that if he had this tendency, it makes it
more likely that he did what [A] alleges he did, that he
did what [B] alleges he
did. But the defence, of course, say to you, 'Look, at the end of the day, all
of this tendency reasoning
process still comes down to the fact you would have
to be in a position whereby you could accept the evidence of [A] and [B].' And,
of course, for reasons that have been advanced by Mr Wright and that I'll touch
on shortly, they say to you, you ought not accept
them as being reliable and
believable witnesses, and they join that critique in with [C] as well. All
Before leaving this topic of tendency evidence, let me just add this: you
ought to take some care in how you approach this evidence.
You must be careful
to avoid allowing emotional reaction to the evidence to colour your logical
application of the evidence in the
manner that I've described. You must be
careful not to reason that just because you are satisfied he may have undertaken
at a particular point in time, that he's inevitably acted in a similar
way on all these other occasions.
Bear in mind the existence of a tendency cannot prove a crime as and by
itself. It is simply a piece of circumstantial evidence ,
which may or may not
support, depending on your assessment, the conclusion which the prosecution asks
you to draw. All of that is
a matter for you to assess."
ground 3(b) asserts that the probative value of the tendency evidence was
"substantially outweighed by the danger of its
unfair prejudice", neither the
written or oral submissions of the appellant addressed that contention. It is
not surprising that
submissions were not directed to that issue as the
contention is plainly without merit. In addition to the evidence of the two
complainants,
the Crown relied upon the evidence of C as to the appellant's
conduct with her, which evidence is summarised earlier in these reasons.
combination of the evidence of the complainants and C, if accepted, was capable
of establishing both the existence of the tendencies
upon which the Crown sought
to rely, and that the appellant acted on those tendencies. The evidence was
highly probative and the
probative value far outweighed any danger of unfair
prejudice through misuse. The trial judge gave firm and correct directions and
there is no reason to doubt that the jury followed those directions and used the
evidence in the appropriate way.
3 is without merit.
2 asserts that a substantial miscarriage of justice resulted as a consequence of
the admission of "either irrelevant, inadmissible
and/or unfairly prejudicial"
evidence, including specifically:
"(a) uncharged allegations of
violence against the complainant [A];
(b) uncharged acts of sexualised communication between the applicant and
complainant [B];
(c) uncharged allegations of sexual offending against [C]."
to the uncharged allegations of violence by the appellant against complainant A,
the appellant's written submissions contended
that such violence was irrelevant
and "could in no way impact an assessment of whether a sexual relationship
evidence of A was as follows:
"[A], I'm going to ask some questions
remember, did [the
appellant] ever do anything physical toward you rather than
sexual ?......Yeah.
What do you remember?......He would grab me by the throat because I was
trying to leave and he slammed me down and, yeah, ripped my
bag to pieces.
In comparison to when you spoke to [Detective Starr] in August 2020, how long
beforehand did that happened?...... It wasn't that long
because I was trying to
leave to go to the cops.
And at that time, was [B] still living at your house?...... That was –
it was like the – this time, she wasn't, but when
he did it last time, she
was, because I ran to her.
So, if we can break that down, do you mean that there were two times that
something like this happened?...... Yeah, there was more.
The two times that you talked about, though, is it right that once
[B] was at the house, and one time, [B] wasn't at the house?...... Yep.
The time that [B] wasn't at the house, was that before or after she lived
with your family?...... After.
On that occasion –sorry, if I come back a moment. You described
something to do with a bag?...... Yeah.
When did the thing happen with the bag? Which time did that happen?......
When [B] wasn't there.
Alright. So, if I ask you about the time that [B] was there, what happened
when [B] was there?......He was trying to separate us and
then I was trying to
go up the hallway to [B] and I just kept getting screamed at, and then come back
to the lounge room, and he's
like, grabbed me and slammed me to the ground,
like, right near the fireplace, and Mum was screaming at him telling him to get
and then, yeah, she started afterwards.
And when you say, 'she started afterwards,' what do you mean by
that?......She was just – she was just screaming at me. Like,
And do you mean your mum?...... Yep.
The time after [B] had left, can you describe what happened that
time?........He was being an asshole so I was like, 'Well, fuck you.
to the cops, I'm leaving.' And then I was in my bedroom and, yeah, he, like,
grabbed me by the throat, put me on the ground,
and then I had my bag full of my
clothes because I was leaving and, it's like, he just ripped the bag to pieces.
So, I just grabbed
my shoes and ran.
Where did you go to when you ran?......I went to [NW's] house.
To clarify, is that where [B] was living by then ?...... Yep."
first occasion of physical violence was said to have occurred when complainant B
lived at the house and at a time when the appellant
was attempting to separate
the complainants from each other's company. In her video statement, complainant
B said she left the home
because there had been "a massive argument". She and
the complainant did not wish to leave each other alone in separate bedrooms.
Complainant B recorded a video of the appellant, "bashing complainant A", the
audio of which was played into the video statement.
Complainant B said she saw
bruises to complainant A's arm and, later, saw a red mark around her neck. A
complained to B that the
appellant had choked her and said she had run
to the evidence being led via the pre-recording of A's evidence, although the
topic of violent conduct was mentioned, no objection
was advanced. In closing
submissions counsel for the Crown briefly mentioned the ripping of the bag and
grabbing of A's throat in
dealing with the sequence of events. The trial judge
did not mention this topic other than referring to defence counsel's
submission.
appellant's submission with respect to the violence perpetrated by the appellant
against A is devoid of merit. The entire relationship
between the appellant and
A was directly relevant to a determination by the jury as to whether the
unlawful sexual acts relied upon
by the Crown, and other general sexual abuse,
occurred. Evidence of violence was capable of explaining the conduct of A and
her responses
to the appellant. No special attention was given to the violence.
It was treated as part of the evidence hearing upon the relationship
between the
appellant and A.
first occasion of violence occurred in the presence of A's mother. The mother's
lack of protection for A was part of the evidence
capable of explaining why A
remained in the family home and, subsequently, made a statement withdrawing her
complaint to police.
As the Crown put it, "each event formed part of the
factual matrix of the various relationships and tensions in [complainant A's]
household, how this came to a head and ultimately led to [complainant A]
revealing the accused's offending to friend's and then to
to the second act of violence, complainant A gave evidence that the violence
occurred after she told the appellant she was going
to the police. As the Crown
put it in submissions, this violence being used as a "means of silencing the
complainant also served
to allow the jury to assess the complainant's state of
mind about complaining to police and any delay in her complaint."
Complainant
A gave evidence that the "whole family" on the appellant's side was "scary".
That evidence was given in conjunction with
her evidence that the appellant's
brother, AC, the appellant's sister KC and A's mother wrote out a retraction
statement and the
appellant's brother said "you're coming with me, we're going
to take your statement back". Evidence of the violence was directly
relevant to
A's fear of the appellant and his family, and to a consideration of the
circumstances in which A made her withdrawal
evidence was highly relevant. Its prejudicial value, that is the danger of
unfair prejudice through misuse, was slight. Such
evidence was given in the
context of the complainant's evidence of sexual violence committed against her
by the appellant over a
number of years. The evidence was rightly admitted.
second category of evidence said to have been irrelevant and inadmissible
concerned evidence of complainant B about text communications
with the appellant
which commenced with the appellant asking whether she masturbated.
evidence of B was as follows:
"Okay, so just before [B], you said
that [the appellant] sent you messages saying, 'do you masturbate'?
Okay, how did [the appellant] send you these messages? Through Messenger on
And Messenger is?
Is the Facebook app.
Okay, and has he sent you any messages before he sent you that message?
Um, yeah we were talking and like he was asking if I was okay and everything
because I was at my mom's house and I normally don't
go well down there. And I
was like, yeah, so it's okay. And then he just I was like, he asked what to talk
I might go anyway because we're going somewhere and
he's like, I've got a question. I'm like, okay, and he asked if I masturbate,
you know, that's weird. And I just said what the fuck and then blocked him.
Okay, then.
I don't want to talk to him.
So the only message he sent you is do you masturbate? Yeah.
And that was it?
And that was the only - Okay then.
And he was telling me to delete the messages as well. Like any other
messages, normal messages between me and him. He told me to delete
them and not
tell my dad or anyone that I was messaging him. I said, like I didn't think
anything of it, like why does that matter,
you are my uncle, who's going to go
A screenshot of the exchange was tendered as an exhibit. In essence, with
question marks and laughing emoji's, the appellant wrote
"maybe u masturbate??",
to which the complainant replied "uh I don't fucking think so". The complainant
added the letters "Wtf".
The exchange continued in which the appellant wrote
"I'm funny asf", to which the complainant replied "No", following which the
wrote "Why not" and "U angry with me now??".
The exchange also included a despondent figure kicking what appears to be a can
above which appear the words "Okay, ignore me",
and below which are the words
"But one day you're going to miss how much I cared". The complainant
"I'm use to people not caring so not really plus that
question was just fucking weird".
The exchanges concluded with the following:
"Appellant: I was being
stupid but u got crabby reckoned u trusted me but obviously not.
Complainant: No i don't I can't talk anymore bye.
Appellant: Wot u mean by that.
Appellant: Ok then."
Complainant B also gave evidence that in "normal messages" between her and the
appellant, she was told by the appellant to delete
the messages and not tell her
father or anyone about them.
written submissions the appellant advanced the following
contention:
"The use of the message relating to masturbation could
only be relevant to demonstrate the Applicant's sexual interest in [complainant
B], and the use of [B's] evidence that the Applicant asked her to delete the
messages and not tell other people could only have been
relevant as
consciousness of guilt. Given this, and in any event, in the context of this
trial, the admission of this evidence was
unfairly prejudicial, in that neither
piece of evidence could rationally affect whether the Applicant offended against
at trial objected to the admission of the evidence and the discussion with the
trial judge discloses her Honour's view that
the jury could view the exchange as
demonstrating an interest in B's sexual behaviours and demonstrative of the
appellant's sexual
interest in her. Her Honour was correct and the written
submissions of the appellant concede that the message relating to masturbation
could be relevant to demonstrate the appellant's sexual interest in B. The Crown
also urged the jury to find that these exchanges
demonstrated that the accused
set out to establish a relationship with B which included building trust and
matters. The evidence was highly probative of the
appellant's sexual interest in B.
the context of the tendency evidence, in addition to the obvious relevance and
high probative value of the evidence, the Crown
pointed out that the tendency
evidence assists in explaining behaviour which might otherwise be perceived as
highly risky and implausible.
I agree with the Crown submission in this
the context of risk-taking behaviour by the appellant, and rebutting the
appearance of implausibility, the decision of the High
Hughes v The
[2017] HCA 20
263 CLR 338
is instructive. The appellant had been
convicted of sexual offences against a number of children and the court was
concerned with
the admissibility of evidence "that a man of mature years has a
sexual interest in female children aged 16 years ('underage girls')
tendency to act on that interest by engaging in sexual activity with underage
girls opportunistically, notwithstanding the
risk of detection" [2].
proposed evidence was held to possess significant probative value and to be
admissible. In the joint judgment of Kiefel CJ,
Bell, Keane and Edelman JJ, the
following general observations were made with respect to tendency
"[40] In the trial of child sexual offences, it is common
for the complainant's account to be challenged on the basis that it has
fabricated or that anodyne conduct has been misinterpreted. Logic and human
experience suggest proof that the accused is a person
who is sexually interested
in children and who has a tendency to act on that interest is likely to be
influential to the determination
of whether the reasonable possibility that the
complainant has misconstrued innocent conduct or fabricated his or her account
been excluded. The particularity of the tendency and the capacity of its
demonstration to be important to the rational assessment
of whether the
prosecution has discharged its onus of proof will depend upon a consideration of
the circumstances of the case. The
test posed by
: 'the disputed
evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make
up the elements of the offence charged'.
The only qualification to this is that
it is not necessary that the disputed evidence has this effect
. It is sufficient if the disputed evidence together with other
evidence makes significantly more likely any facts making up the elements
offence charged. Of course, where there are multiple counts on an indictment, it
is necessary to consider each count separately
to assess whether the tendency
evidence which is sought to be adduced in relation to that count is
admissible."
summarising the relevant evidence, their Honours concluded that the evidence, as
a whole, was "capable of proving that the
appellant was a person with a tendency
to engage in sexually predatory conduct with underage girls as and when an
opportunity presented
itself in order to obtain fleeting gratification,
notwithstanding the high risk of detection." The judgment continued:
"[57] An inclination on the part of a mature adult to engage in
sexual conduct with underage girls and a willingness to act upon that
inclination are unusual as a matter of ordinary human experience. Often,
evidence of such an inclination will include evidence of
grooming of potential
victims so as to reveal a 'pattern of conduct' or a 'modus operandi' which would
qualify the evidence as admissible
at common law. But significant probative
value may be demonstrated in other ways. In this case the tendency evidence
showed that
the unusual interactions which the appellant was alleged to have
pursued involved courting a substantial risk of discovery by friends,
members, workmates or even casual passers-by. This level of disinhibited
disregard of the risk of discovery by other adults
is even more unusual as a
matter of ordinary human experience. The evidence might not be described as
involving a pattern of conduct
or modus operandi – for the reason that
each alleged offence involved a high degree of opportunism; but to accept that
is so is not to accept that the evidence does no more than prove a
disposition to commit crimes of the kind in question.
[58] Given the complainants' ages, consent was not an issue in any of the
counts. It was the defence case on each count that the complainant
fabricated her account. That the tendency evidence did more than prove a
disposition to commit crimes of the kind in question,
and was actually of
significant value as proof of his guilt of the offences charged, can be
illustrated by hypothesising separate
trials in respect of each complainant with
the only evidence against the appellant being the evidence of the complainant.
such case, the jury would be presented with a prosecution case inviting
it to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant
had engaged in
behaviour towards the complainant which involved predatory sexual activity
pursued by taking opportunistic advantage
of a social or family or work occasion
in circumstances in which the appellant courted a real risk of discovery by
other adults.
[59] Considered in isolation, JP's evidence might have seemed inherently
unlikely: the appellant, a family friend, at dinner in JP's
himself from the party and came into her bedroom, and without making any attempt
to ensure her silence, commenced
to invasively sexually assault her while his
daughter lay sleeping in the same bed. The jury might well be disinclined to
JP's evidence as satisfying it, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the
appellant had, in fact, engaged in conduct which was so much
at odds with the
jury's experience of the probabilities of ordinary human behaviour. Proof of the
appellant's tendency to engage
in sexual activity with underage girls
opportunistically, notwithstanding the evident risk, was capable of removing a
doubt which
the brazenness of the appellant's conduct might otherwise have
[60] The force of the tendency evidence as significantly probative of the
appellant's guilt was not that it gave rise to a likelihood
that the appellant,
having offended once, was likely to offend again. Rather, its force was that, in
the case of this individual
accused, the complaint of misconduct on his part
should not be rejected as unworthy of belief because it appeared improbable
regard to ordinary human experience."
times the conduct of the appellant as described by the complainants and C could
reasonably be described as "risky". The remarks
of the majority in
are directly applicable.
As to the evidence of complainant B that in "normal messages" between her and
the appellant, she was told by the appellant to delete
the messages and not tell
her father or anyone about the messages, the appellant submitted that such
evidence "could only have been
relevant as consciousness of guilt". Nothing was
said by the trial judge to the jury in this context about consciousness of
Counsel for the Crown suggested the messages were attempts by the
appellant to build trust and contact about personal matters, but
did not mention
the request to delete the messages.
Again, the evidence concerning deleting messages and not telling anyone about
them was part of the evidence of the relationship
that the appellant cultivated
with B. Secrecy between the appellant and B was a feature of the relationship.
It was not led as evidence
of a consciousness of guilt of unlawful sexual
The third category of evidence within ground 2 about which the appellant
complains concerned the evidence of C, a friend of A and
B, which the
appellant's written submissions summarise as follows:
statement she C gave evidence that the applicant:
would give her a
hug and that on occasion he would say 'you can only come in if you give me a
touched [A] and
her thighs;
would put his
'fingers under my shorts a little bit',
messages where he would say 'I love you';
stayed in the
bathroom (after she had asked him to leave) and washed her hair."
The first and second bullet points do not adequately convey the impact of the
evidence given by C which was as follows:
"Um, and I used to –
well I'm friends with [A] and when I –
cos I used to go over there like every day and her dad always used to like
– I – I don't know why, it probably doesn't
even sound weird, but he
just used to like hug me and like never let me go, and I went at one time
– well a few times and said
I've messaged him and said 'can I come over?' and yeah whatever, and then I'd
get on the doorstep and, like I'd take my shoes off
– whatever else, and
then he'd say, ' you can only come in if you give me a cuddle.' So, I'd give him
a cuddle and then like,
I'd walk in, he'd just keep hugging me and he used to
like, sit me in [A]'s room and just ask me to just to do this to me. Cos, I
don't know, it just felt really uncomfortable, and there was one time when it
was just me, [A] and [the appellant] – [A]'s
dad there and he was sitting
– laying in his bed, and then [A] came and crawled in and then he said
– they said, '[C],
come in.' So, it was [the appellant], [A] and me, and
then he said – the dad come over this side, and he was just doing this
– like touching her thighs.
Okay, so tell me about the time that you were there and he said 'come –
come and sit on bed' and just start from the beginning
of when you first got
Um, so I knocked on the door, [A] answered, and then [A] went to go back into
the bed, so I was just sitting on the couch, cos you've
got [the appellant]'s
bedroom here and then just past his door is the lounge room, and I was just
sitting on the couch, which is
like closest to the bedroom, and then he said
– him and [A] said 'come in here'. So there was – yeah there was
[the appellant],
[A] and me, and then he said 'no, come round this side, [C].'
So I went round that side and we were just like, - cos there's a TV
in there. We
were just like just watching TV – and then he just started doing this and
Okay, so when you first got there, where was [A]?
On – in that bed in the bedroom.
Okay. So [A] was in the bedroom with [the appellant]?
Okay, and how did [A] look to you?
I dunno, she was – she was sorta shocked that I had knocked on the
door, and she looked sort of relieved when I knocked on the
door, and then she
said, 'come in – come in' and like, real fast, like 'come in' and like
pulled my arm and said 'come and
And I was like 'okay'.
So [A] sat down on the lounge with you? Yeah.
Okay, and then what's happened?
He just said 'girls come in here' – no, cos [A] went and laid on next
to [the appellant] and then I was there on the couch (indistinct
words) so she
came and sat in the couch with – on the couch with me, and [the appellant]
said 'what are youse doing, come and
sit in here with me' –
...and then –
Okay, so – you – you've gone on the bed okay – Yeah.
...and then sat next to [A]?
Yeah I sat next to [A], then [the appellant] sorta grabbed me and said 'come
round this side – come round this side'.
Okay, so you've got on the bed, and tell me how you were laying on the
Just like this – Okay.
...and sorta like flat with like, my head was just up.
Okay, and what about [A], how was [A] laying on the bed? Sorta the same as
And he like, was like this, and like, hugging us real close to him. Okay, and
how did you feel when that happened?
Not okay. I just thought that's not okay. Yeah.
That's wrong.
And did he say anything when you did that?
Nuh, he just like just did it and I was like, after he touched mine and [A]'s
thighs, [A] had her phone with her and I went to the
toilet, cos I was just like
trying to get out of it, and I went to the toilet and I got [A], cos [A] like
followed me and went to
her room, and I got [A] to like fake call me to say my
mum wants me to come home, and then –"
As to the appellant putting his fingers under C's shorts, in evidence C said
the appellant placed his hand on her leg, her thigh
and toward her hip, and his
fingers were under her shorts "a little bit", being "near the undie line sort
of. C said the presence
of the appellant's hand made her feel uncomfortable and
she described him as a "very strange man" who used to write her messages
o'clock in the morning. She said the appellant used to write "love you". C would
respond with either "love you back" or "okay".
At that time C was aged 11
As to the appellant staying in the bathroom, C was asked in the police
interview whether there was anything else that she wanted
to talk about. She
gave the following answer:
"Yes actually. One time I was at –
sitting, like I went there and [D], her older – [A]'s older brother was in
the toilet,
and [A] was like getting changed or something, and I was sitting on
the couch like – cos their couch goes like that, I was
sitting – no
he was sitting here, cos that's always his spot, and I'm sitting in the corner
...and I – cos my hair was out, I was just playing with my hair, and I
said 'oh my God my hair feels like straw, I so need to
wash it' just mucking
around, and he said to me 'well do you want to go and have a shower?' and I was
like 'I'm gonna head home and
I'll be back soon' cos this was on a weekend, and
he said 'no you can just have one here' and I was like – like I denied it
for a little bit, and I was like 'oh whatever, okay'. So I got in there and I
was about to get undressed, and I was like 'could you
please get out, and when
you get out I'll just lock the door' and he said 'no I'll stay in here', and I
was like – and I was
like 'I'll just wash my hair' – 'I'll just bend
over and wash my hair then'.
So I did that, and he's like – and then he started like doing this.
Sorta like nothing weird, but he obviously did, and then
it was like, and I had
put my clothes on after that, but he was just doing that –
...like rubbing conditioner in my hair."
Shortly after the answer cited, the interviewing officer said "okay, so when
you were in the bathroom and he just closed the door,
what happened then?". C
gave the following answer:
"I was like – cos I was like
– cos I took my jumper off, I was like, 'okay so when you hop out I will
lock the door behind
you', and then he's like, 'no – no – no –
no – no, I'll just stay in here' and I was like 'okay', and I was
you know what I might just like – just wash my hair and keep my clothes
on' and he was like 'okay' and then he just
started – yeah, doing that
In the written submission, the appellant contended that the evidence of C was
"entirely irrelevant" and "unfairly prejudicial".
The submission contended that
the evidence was "an attempt to put before the jury impermissible propensity
evidence", and was "nothing
more than an attempt by the prosecution to evoke in
the jury an emotional reaction to the prejudice of the Applicant".
That submission is devoid of merit. The evidence of C was part of the tendency
evidence upon which the Crown relied and it was plainly
of substantial probative
The appellant also submitted that as C's evidence about the appellant touching
her and A's legs was not one of the particulars upon
which the prosecution
relied, this evidence of "extraneous uncharged acts" possess the real "capacity
to confuse the jury with what
sexual acts were relied upon for count 1". This
submission is also misconceived. There was no danger of the jury confusing a
of C's leg with occasion 1 which was touching A's vagina after she came
out of the shower.
Finally in this context, the appellant submitted that evidence given by C as to
the state of her relationship with A amounted to
an "attempt to bolster the
witness's evidence" which was impermissible. I do not agree. Evidence as to the
relationship between
the complainant and her friend at particular times was
admissible as part of the total circumstances surrounding the incidents under
consideration by the jury.
Ground 2 is not made out.
Ground 4 – severance
Ground 4 is a complaint that a substantial miscarriage of justice occurred "as
a consequence of the failure of trial counsel to
seek severance of the
Indictment". Accepting that s 326A of the
Criminal Code
presumption that if two or more charges for sexual offences are joined in the
same Indictment, it is presumed those charges
are to be tried together, and
tried together notwithstanding that the evidence on one charge is inadmissible
on another charge, the
appellant referred to s 326(3) as a basis for contending
that counsel at trial should have sought severance of the Indictment. Section
326(3) provides that if it appears that an accused person "may be prejudiced or
embarrassed in his defence by reason of being charged
with more than one crime
in the same indictment, or that for any other reason it is desirable to direct
that he should be tried separately
for any one or more crimes charged in the
indictment, the judge may order a separate trial of any count or counts in such
indictment."
The appellant's written submission contained the following
propositions:
"3.4.4 In the circumstances of this case, the nature
and content of the allegation in respect of count 1 are – by many orders
of magnitude – more serious than those the subject of count 2. Moreover,
it is not simply that that count 1 is more serious,
the nature of the offending
is palpably different, and there is a real risk that count 1 would overwhelm the
separate consideration
required for count 2.
3.4.5 Further, the risks identified above are amplified when significant
evidence of uncharged acts is adduced. Put simply, the sheer
volume of material
relating to count 1 overwhelms the evidence in respect of count 2 to the point
where it was unfairly prejudicial
to the accused in this trial on count 2."
I do not agree that there existed a "real risk that count 1 would overwhelm the
separate consideration required for count 2". Nor
do I agree that the "sheer
volume of material relating to count 1 overwhelms the evidence in respect of
count 2" to the point where
it was unfairly prejudicial to the accused with
respect to his trial on count 2. The jury would not have had any difficulty in
the evidence relevant to each count.
In addition, the tendency evidence relied upon the Crown to establish the
appellant's sexual interest and tendency to engage in
sexual contact with young
female children would have been admissible in a separate trial of the charge in
Ground 4 is without merit.
Ground 5 – failure to call
Ground 5 asserts that the failure of the Crown to call "relevant and material
witnesses" resulted in a substantial miscarriage of
justice. The written
submissions of the appellant identify six persons who the appellant contended
should have been called by the
Crown to give evidence. The failure of the Crown
to do so was, submitted the appellant, "productive of a substantial miscarriage
of justice", particularly as four of those persons "were present at the time
when some of the unlawful sexual activity was said to
first witness was identified as EG. The appellant's written submissions were as
"3.6.6 [EG] was the friend of [A] who was at the Healthglow
Pool with the Applicant (and others) when occasion three was said to have
occurred. In her disclosure of this event to police, [A] describes that she was
there with the Applicant (and others) and that the
Applicant was throwing her
and EG in the pool. [A] said that EG was swimming around and at this time the
Applicant put his penis
.) of my vagina'. Importantly, at
that stage, [A] said that it was just her, EG and the Applicant because 'mum
.) had got out to get changed'. In her evidence at trial, [A]'s
evidence changed. Under cross-examination from defence counsel, [A]
said that at
the time the sexual offending occurred, EG had exited the pool to get changed
.The prior inconsistent statement was
put to [A] and she confirms that EG was no
longer in the pool.
3.6.7 By any objective assessment, [EG] was a relevant witness in this case.
She was present the Healthglow pool at the time the offending
was said to have
occurred. Her importance in the trial was amplified when [A] departs from the
version of events she gave to police
in August 2020 in her Video Recorded
Interview. [A]'s departure from her initial statement to police was material
because it was
capable of rationally impacting an objective assessment of the
credibility and reliability of her version of events. If [EG] had
been called,
and confirmed [A]'s initial statement that she was in the pool the whole time,
then [A]'s version was contradicted,
and made the Applicant's ability to offend
in the way that was alleged both less likely and less plausible."
The occasion under question was occasion four, an act of penile vaginal
intercourse which complainant A gave evidence occurred while
swimming at the
Health Glow Pool. In her video interview with police, A described being in the
pool with her friend, mother and two
brothers. She said that after her brothers
and mother left the pool, her friend was "too busy swimming" and the appellant
it in the water" by putting his penis into the top of her vagina. She
said the appellant pulled her pants down and it occurred "over
to the side of
gave pre-recorded evidence in the absence of the jury over two years after she
was interviewed by the police. She gave the following
"Q: [A], do you remember telling [Detective Starr] about
something happening at the Health Glow Pool
Q: And do you remember that you told Taneka that [the appellant] put his
penis into the top of your vagina
A: No, he put it into my vagina
Q: When you say he put it into your vagina, was it the same thing that
happened on other occasions
Q: Did he remove any of your clothing to do that
A: No. Well he pulled my pants down but he didn't, like, fully take them
Q: And what type of pants were you wearing
cross-examination, contrary to her statement to police, A maintained that
everybody else was out of the pool when the act
of intercourse occurred. She
maintained her evidence in that regard notwithstanding that it was put to her
that in 2020 she had
told police her friend was busy swimming around the pool
when the act occurred:
"Now, you told police that your father was in
the pool and had sexual intercourse with you, is that correct?......Yep.
Now, you suggest that, in fact, it was after your brother and your mother had
got out of the pool, is that right?......Everyone had
Everyone, including [EG]?......Yep, everyone had got out.
Right. When you told police, however, though, in 2020, you said that
[EG] was busy swimming around in the pool when this happened. Can you
remember saying that?......Not when it happened, we were all,
like, swimming and
then [BC] wanted to get out first, so then [BC] and [DC] and Mum got out, and
then me and [EG] were still in the
pool for a bit. And then she went and got
out, and then it was just me and [the appellant] in there."
Crown called A's mother who gave evidence that she got out of the pool first and
entered the changerooms to have a shower. She
said A came in after her and they
shared the shampoo. When she left the pool the boys were getting out.
cross-examination A's mother said A came into the changerooms not long after her
as she had only just got into the shower
and started using the shampoo. Asked
to put a timeframe on it, she said "two minutes or so, I reckon". Probably
another couple
of minutes later A's friend (EG) entered the changerooms.
Crown called both brothers who were present at the pool. The younger brother,
born in 2009, was asked in examination whether
he remembered anything about
going to the pool on the particular occasion in question. He replied "No". Very
shortly after giving
that answer, he was asked in cross-examination whether he
remembered who got out of the pool first and he replied "Mum and [A]."
younger brother was unable to remember who got out in what sequence.
re-examination, the younger brother was reminded of his evidence in examination
that he was unable to remember what happened at
the pool, and of his answer in
cross-examination that his mother and sister got out of the pool first. Asked
why he was able to remember
his mother and A getting out of the pool first, the
younger brother responded "I don't know".
prosecutor was given leave to cross-examine and the younger brother maintained
that his mother and A got out of the pool first.
He displayed a distinct lack of
memory as to other occasions at the pool and, in view of the number of occasions
at the pool, he
agreed it was hard to remember what happened on each occasion
and who got out of the pool first on such occasions. However, the younger
brother continued to maintain that it was his mother and A who got out first.
elicited from the younger brother that he was aware his father was meant to have
done something "bad at the pool with [A]".
He agreed he was told this by his
mother and father a few years ago. It was put to him that he did not want to
get his father into
trouble, and he answered "But it's a lie". When it was put
to him that he pretended to have a memory of his mother and A getting
pool first, he replied "I didn't pretend cos they did get out first".
older brother, born in 2005, was asked in examination whether he remembered who
got out of the pool first, and answered "Mum
and [A]". He said he got out of
the pool about 15 minutes later.
prosecutor was given leave, immediately, to cross-examine the older brother. He
agreed he had been able to watch the statement
he gave to the police in 2020. It
was put to him that there was more than one occasion when he went to the pool,
and he denied that
proposition. It was put to him that he had been to the pool
a few times with his mother and he answered "I can't remember that,
the older brother disagreed with a suggestion about who was present on another
occasion with his father, he maintained that
on the occasion with his father,
his mother and A got out first. When it was put to him that he did not have a
memory of who got
out first, the older brother repeated "Mum and [A] got out of
the pool first".
older brother agreed that just after A had left the house in about August 2020,
he was told that something was meant to have
happened at the pool. He denied,
however, that when he had been asked to remember who got out of the pool first,
he understood he
was asked that question because his father was meant to have
been in the pool with A alone and "did something there". He disagreed
suggestion that he was trying to avoid his father getting into trouble.
Immediately
following the evidence under cross-examination by Crown counsel, the older
brother was cross-examined by counsel for
the appellant. He was asked a number
of questions about making a statement to police in September 2020 and answered
positively about
his statement to police that his mother and A got out of the
pool first. He agreed he remembered the events in that way back in September
said he had not been told about the pool allegation before September 2020. It
might reasonably be said that there was a significant
improvement in the older
brother's memory when cross-examination was undertaken by counsel for the
jury was aware that A's evidence that EG was out of the pool before the sexual
assault occurred was in conflict with her statement
to police. In addition, the
jury had the evidence of A's brothers that she and her mother were the first to
exit the pool, evidence
which was supported by the evidence of A's mother
concerning the timing of A entering the changerooms. The issue as to who left
the pool first was relevant to A's credit, but it also bore upon the likelihood
of the appellant committing a sexual act as described
by A if EG and others were
still in the pool.
difficulty with the complaint that the Crown failed to call EG is the fact that,
at trial, no request was made for the Crown
to call EG. It is not known whether
the appellant, through his legal advisors, possessed any information as to what
EG might say
if EG was called to give evidence. The police investigation did not
produce a statement from EG.
Significantly,
there is no evidence before this Court as to what EG might have said if she was
called to give evidence at trial.
On the appeal, no explanation was provided
for not requesting that EG be called, and no indication was given as to whether
the appellant
possessed any information as to what EG might have said.
these circumstances, in the absence of a request that the Crown call the
witness, there is no basis for a finding that the failure
to call EG resulted in
a substantial miscarriage of justice.
TD, BW and AC
to three witnesses identified as TD, BW and AC, the appellant advanced the
following submissions:
"3.6.8 In respect of [TD], [BW] and [AC],
each of these people were present at Olinda when [A] contends that the Applicant
penetrated her. This incident was referred to as occasion two. In
respect to this occasion, [A] said in her Video Recorded Interview
'I was with my uncle, my uncle's mate, my friend and dad and we were cutting
wood, and um, he wanted to show me a tree, like a big
round tree and I had to
walk down a big bank and I like walk into the bush and then um and then he raped
me down there and then [TD],
my friend cam (
. [came]) running down to
see the tree and he finished by then, and I was hoping by then he had came
.) down earlier to that he would stop.'
3.6.9 By any objective assessment, each of TD, [BW] and [AC] were relevant
witnesses and ought to have been called by the prosecution.
On [A's] version of
events, TD sees the Applicant and [A] almost immediately after the offending is
said to have occurred and almost
witnesses the Applicant offending against [A].
TD was capable of giving evidence of his memory of that trip, and whether the
of [A] that he almost interrupted the offending was accurate or occurred
3.6.10 Further, [BW] and [AC's] evidence was capable of either supporting (or
contradicting) that the Applicant had taken [A] away
from the group and whether
(or not) it was possible for the Applicant to have an opportunity to offend
against [A] as she claimed."
No statements were taken from TD or BW. AC provided a handwritten statement
during police investigations, but it was not until
the trial was underway that a
police statement was taken from AC.
trial, no request was made of the Crown to call TD or BW. There is no evidence
before this Court as to what TD or BW might have
said if they had given
evidence. The Crown again relied upon the evidence of the complainant that the
sexual assault occurred when
she and the appellant were out of sight of other
persons at the locality.
to AC, although the appellant sought that AC be called in respect of a statement
made by complainant A effectively withdrawing
her complaint to police, a topic
which is dealt with shortly, at no time did counsel for the appellant suggest
that AC should be
called because he could give relevant evidence concerning
occasion three which was alleged to have occurred in the bush near Oldina.
material has been placed before this Court as to evidence AC might have given
concerning the occasion at Oldina if he had been
called at trial. There is no
basis for assuming, as contended in submissions, that AC could have given
relevant evidence.
Significantly,
the Crown was of the view that AC was not a witness of truth. This issue is
discussed later in these reasons.
respect of TD, BW and AC and occasion three at Oldina, there is no basis in the
material before this Court for a finding that
an unfair trial occurred because
the Crown did not call these witnesses. Similarly, there is no basis for a
conclusion that a miscarriage
of justice has occurred in this
AC, KC and NL
proposed evidence from AC, KC and NL related to the circumstances in which,
following a statement to police, complainant A made
a further statement in which
she swore that the contents of her original video statement were untrue
("withdrawal statement"). The
withdrawal statement was before the jury.
written submissions of the appellant provided the following summary of the basis
upon which it was submitted the Crown should
have called these three witnesses,
and why the failure to do so was productive of a substantial miscarriage of
"3.6.11 On 23 October 2020, [A] made a statutory
declaration which she said that:
previous statement 'was not true' and that at the time she made it was using
had made her lie to get back at the family; and
wanted to withdraw her original statement to police.
This statutory
declaration was signed by [A], before a Justice of the Peace – [NL]
– and [A's] aunt [KC]. That document
was tendered in the trial and became
'Exhibit P6'.
3.6.12 In examination-in-chief, [A] was asked if she remembered making the
statement and if it really was her wish to withdraw her
statement, to which she
replied that it was not. [A] said she didn't want to write the statement, the
implication being that she
was compelled to do so.
Issue is taken by
defence counsel about the State's failure to call either [AC] or [KC]. The
prosecutor explains that the State has
concluded that neither are witnesses of
truth and that:
In any event, the evidence to be given, in my submission, with respect to the
withdrawal of the statement goes to credit rather than
any material facts of the
allegation.
3.6.13 Later, an
issue of CCTV cameras being turned off was raised in the context of breaches by
the Applicant of his bail conditions,
and his proximity to the [A]. In response
to a question from her Honour the prosecutor said:
'Your Honour,
the jury have heard the evidence relating to the withdrawal statement. They have
heard the evidence with respect to
the environment in which that was made. In my
submission that they're entitles to assess the family environment. They're
to assess what pressure [A] Was to have felt in relation to making that
statement...'
3.6.14 Ultimately,
her Honour acknowledges that there is some unfairness to the Applicant but
permits the prosecution to adduce evidence
with some limitations.
3.6.15 In this
case, the prosecution was permitted to put before the jury evidence from [A]
that she had been compelled to provide
a statutory declaration withdrawing her
complaint to police, and using the family dynamics as context evidence to
bolster her credibility,
without ever calling the witnesses who might contradict
her version of events. They both want the context evidence before the jury
because it assists the prosecution case and it bolsters the complainant's credit
but downplay the importance of the evidence of [AC]
and [KC] because it only
goes to credit.
credibility and reliability of [A's] account was central to the trial. Her
initial complaints to police were nebulous and
her version of events changed.
The Applicant ought to have had every opportunity to expose those issues that
went to the reliability
of her account.
3.6.17 While the
prosecution advanced a reason for not calling [A's] aunt and uncle, no reason
appears to be proffered for not calling
the Justice of the Peace who witnessed
[A] statement. Her evidence was relevant to the issue of whether [A] was
pressured to make
her withdrawal statement – thus further impacting upon
the overall tenor of [A's] evidence about the family dynamic. Had she
called, the Justice of the Peace could have given evidence about the interaction
with [A] on that day, and whether she observed
anything that would support [A's]
contention. This would have been directly relevant to an assessment of [A]
credibility and reliability.
3.6.18 In the circumstances
of this case, and especially in respect of charge one, the evidence given by
these witnesses was critical.
Because the jury need not be unanimous about the
same three instances of unlawful sexual activity, the capacity of these
to either undermine, contradict, or challenge the version of events
given by [A] was of significance. There is no way to know which
of the pleaded
instance of unlawful sexual offending any of the members of the jury relied on.
If one of those instances can be impacted
the safety of the conviction on count
1 is fundamentally undermined."
was the Justice of the Peace who witnessed the signature of A on the withdrawal
statement. No statement was taken from NL and
the possibility of calling NL was
not raised prior to or during the trial. It is not known what NL might have
said, and there is
no basis in any of the material to suggest that NL might have
been able to give relevant evidence. There is no basis for a conclusion
failure to call NL might have been productive of a miscarriage of justice.
is the appellant's brother and KC is the appellant's sister. Both provided
handwritten statements to police during the investigations.
After the trial
commenced, police statements were obtained from both persons. Broadly speaking,
both statements related to the circumstances
in which complainant A made her
withdrawal statement.
the question of calling these witnesses was first raised with the trial judge,
neither person had provided a statutory declaration
to police. The issue was
first raised on 21 February 2023. Counsel for the appellant informed the trial
judge that KC was one of
the persons alleged by complainant A to have forced her
into making the withdrawal statement and that AC was involved in taking A
police to provide the withdrawal statement. Counsel advised the trial judge that
the Crown had informed him that the prosecutor
was of the view that these
persons were not witnesses of truth.
addition, the trial judge was informed that AC and KC had previously pleaded
guilty to assaulting complainant B. It was an assault
prosecutor confirmed with the trial judge that the Crown did not intend to call
AC or KC. The prosecutor said the view that these
persons were not witnesses of
truth was formed as a consequence of dealings police had with those persons.
She added that in any
event, the withdrawal of the statement was a matter of
credit and KC did not purport to be a witness to any of the material facts.
the trial judge informed counsel for the appellant that if he wished to
formulate an application and seek a ruling, her
Honour would provide such a
ruling. At that time her Honour noted the information from the prosecution that
both persons had declined
to speak with police. Counsel for the appellant
indicated his instructions that AC and KC were willing to speak with police.
issue was again raised with the trial judge on 28 February 2023. In the interim,
police had taken statements from AC and KC.
Counsel for the Crown informed the
trial judge that she had formed the view that neither AC nor KC was a witness of
truth, and that
in the view of the Crown, any potential evidence from AC was
relevant only to the credibility of A. With respect to KC, the Crown
advised the
trial judge that the only potential evidence of relevance concerned allegations
relating to the caravan incident and
KC purported to see nothing.
prosecutor provided a brief explanation as to the basis upon which she was of
the view that these persons were not witnesses
of truth. In addition, the
prosecutor confirmed that if the appellant called either of the witnesses, the
prosecutor would waive
her right to address the jury last.
this Court, the Crown submissions relating to AC and KC (and NL) were as

directly on the likelihood or otherwise of the allegations made by either
complainant. There
was no suggestion on either the Crown or defence case that
the witnesses were direct witnesses to anything which would contradict
complainant's version of events. [AC's] evidence could only relate to the
credibility of [A] as it related to the making of the
withdrawal statement and
did not bear upon the events the subject of the charges. [KC's] evidence related
to the charges was that
she did not see anything consistent with [A]'s evidence
when present at the address at which those events were said to have occurred.
Other witnesses had given similar evidence (including [NW] and [RC]). [KC's]
evidence was otherwise was relevant only to [A]'s credibility
as to the making
of the withdrawal statement. Arguably, much of the evidence of both witnesses
would ordinarily have been excluded
pursuant to
. [NL] was unlikely to be capable of assisting the jury aside from
recalling that [A] had sworn a document before her, a matter which
was clear on
the evidence.
The absence of a satisfactory explanation:
The following matters were
explained to the Court (or disclosed to counsel for the appellant) in respect of
the evidence of [AC] and
The witnesses
had a history of unsatisfactory interactions with Tasmania Police, including
when attempts were made to obtain a statement
from them. One of those
interactions included, as the subject of sworn evidence, intimidating conduct by
[AC] when accompanying the
complainant [A] to a police officer to withdraw her
statement. They had otherwise avoided attempts to participate in a statutory
declaration prior to the commencement of the trial.
Both [AC] and
[KC] had a prior conviction for an assault committed upon the complainant [B],
in the aftermath of her complaint to
police in 2020.
recent prior conviction which bore upon his status as a witness of the truth (a
prior conviction for perverting justice,
as disclosed to counsel for the
appellant). The circumstances of that offending, as provided by the comments on
passing sentence,
demonstrated that [AC] had engaged complainant [B] to be
complicit in his lies to police.
The view reach
by the State as to lack of materiality of each witness was outlined to the
Was there unfairness in the context of how the state ran its case:
is noted that the appellant, while having the opportunity to call [AC] and [KC]
on his own case, did not do so. It was explicitly
offered that, if the appellant
were to call the witnesses on his own case, the State would maintain the order
of addresses and address
first, thus reducing any forensic disadvantage
occasioned.
is contended that, when viewed against the running of the trial as a whole, the
failure of the State to call [AC]and [KC], and
[NL], did not amount to a
miscarriage of justice. They were not witnesses to the events giving rise to the
crimes alleged by the
appellant and were thus not material witnesses. The jury
were not deprived of assessing the case before them, in a material sense,
their absence. The State's offer to retain the order of addresses, even if the
evidence of [AC] and [KC] was to be adduced
by the accused, addressed any
forensic disadvantaged occasioned by a failure to call them on the Crown
numerous witnesses the appellant contended should have been called by the Crown,
the ground of appeal is noteworthy for its
lack of a request of the crown during
the trial for the witnesses to be called, and across all witnesses for its lack
of information
as to evidence that any of the witnesses might have been able to
give. The exception to that general observation is found in the
submissions before this Court to which I have referred. In the particular
circumstances under consideration, it is impossible
for this Court to assess
whether proposed evidence would be relevant to the critical issues, or would
bear upon credit only. It is
impossible for this Court to make any assessment as
to the potential reliability or otherwise of proposed evidence.
circumstances under consideration did not justify a
Jones v Dunkel
Counsel for the
appellant at trial did not seek such a direction and in submissions to the jury
did not mention the absence of any
of those witnesses. The trial judge correctly
directed the jury not to speculate about what any of these witnesses might have
had they given evidence.
some circumstances, the absence of a witness might, in itself, justify a court
concluding that a fair trial had not taken place
and a miscarriage of justice
had occurred. Those circumstances do not exist in the matter under
consideration. As far as this Court
is aware there has been no impediment to
the appellant placing before this Court information as to the evidence that
might have been
given had the witness or witnesses been called.
to AC and KC, the Crown was not obliged to explain why the Crown was of the view
that AC and KC were not witnesses of truth. However,
such explanation as was
provided, was adequate. Further, as the Crown's submissions demonstrate, AC and
KC can reasonably be described
as "in the appellant's camp" and no doubt the
appellant was in a position to ascertain details of the evidence they might have
Further, although the Crown would have been able to cross-examine the
witnesses had they been called by the appellant, there would
not have been any
other forensic disadvantage. The Crown agreed at trial that if the appellant
called AC and KC, the Crown would
not insist on a right of reply and would
address the jury first.
Finally as to KC, although not mentioned by counsel for the appellant in the
appeal, on 22 November 2022 the appellant applied in
the Supreme Court for an
order that preliminary proceedings be conducted for the purpose of
cross-examining witnesses, including
KC. That application was withdrawn before
the trial judge on 25 November 2022.
In addition, it appears that KC was made available by the Crown on 25 November
2022 in anticipation of counsel for the appellant
seeking to question KC in a
process known as a Basha inquiry. Counsel for the Crown indicated the purpose of
KC's presence was to
facilitate the Basha inquiry only, and was not an
indication that "necessarily" KC would be a witness at trial.
Counsel for the appellant did not pursue the Basha inquiry, and advised the
trial judge as follows:
"HER HONOUR: All right, Thank you very much.
Mr Wright, you don't require the witness at any date forthcoming?
MR WRIGHT: Not forthcoming, your Honour. When the trial is scheduled, if the
State's not call them, I anticipate that I will be."
This course of events and the exchanges with the trial judge demonstrate that
counsel at trial had access to KC and was alert to
the possibility of calling
KC. Counsel did not suggest that the Crown should call KC and it seems tolerably
clear that counsel made
a forensic decision not to call KC.
of the grounds of appeal have been made out. For these reasons I would dismiss
the appeal against
