REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application referred to the Tribunal by the Chief Executive Office of Fair
Trading under the
Agents and Motor Dealers Act
(“the Act”). It is a claim by Linda Harju and Nigel
Jacob (“the first applicants”) against the claim fund
established
under the Act. The first applicants allege that they suffered financial loss
because of the conduct of O’Neill
Holdings Group Pty Ltd and Robert J
respondents did not attend the directions hearing or file any material as
ordered. The respondents did not attend the hearing
today. I am satisfied that
they were given notice of the hearing and I intend to proceed in their
first applicants rely on the material contained in the file of the Office of
Fair Trading, which is in evidence before the Tribunal.
That material sets out
the background to the claim.
January 2008 as the first applicants were shifting to Western Australia, they
decided to sell their two vehicles, a Mazda 323 Astina
and a Holden Rodeo, both
of which they had previously purchased from the respondents. They initially
agreed to sell the vehicles
through the respondents in consideration of a fee of
$890.00 per vehicle and they left the vehicles with the respondents. A few days
later they noticed that the Mazda was no longer in the yard of O’Neill
Family Motors. The second respondent confirmed that
the Mazda had been sold.
Some days after that, the second respondent informed the first applicants that
he would buy the Holden Rodeo.
On 24 January 2008 the second respondent told the
first applicants that he would purchase both vehicles from them for $17,000.00.
The second respondent confirmed that in a document dated that day and signed by
him. The document is page 15 of the annexures to
the claim document lodged by
the first applicants with the Office of Fair Trading on 1 December 2008. In
fact the respondents wholesaled
the Holden Rodeo to another dealer on 23 January
2008 and the Astina to the same dealer on 25 January 2008.
first applicants pursued the second respondent for the money owed to them on
numerous occasions by telephone from Western Australia,
but to no avail. In
April 2008 the first applicants returned to the Gold Coast in an endeavour to
obtain their money, but were told
that the business was no longer operating.
They made a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading on 18 August 2008 and on 1
2008 they made a claim against the claim fund.
Legislation
of the Act states:
470 Restriction on recovery of reward or
expense—no proper authorisation etc
(1) A person may make a claim against the fund if the person suffers
financial loss because of the happening of any of the following
(e) a stealing, misappropriation or misapplication by a relevant person
of property entrusted to the person as agent for someone
else in the person's
capacity as a relevant person.”
is clear from the facts that the first applicants entrusted their vehicles to
the respondents who offered to purchase them for
$17,000.00. In fact the
respondents wholesaled the vehicles to another dealer. The respondents have
failed to account to the first
applicants for the agreed purchase price of the
second respondent was a licensee and a relevant
respondent was not licensed, but acted as a licensee and comes within the
definition of licensee and is a relevant
evidence satisfies me that the respondents, as relevant persons, have stolen,
misappropriated or misapplied property entrusted
to them by the first
applicants.
am satisfied that because of the respondents’ conduct the first applicants
have suffered financial loss in the amount of the
agreed purchase price of the
vehicles of $17,000.00.
first applicants’ claim against the claim fund is allowed in the sum of
$17,000.00.
persons who are liable for the first applicants’ financial loss are the
respondents O’Neill Holdings Group Pty Ltd
and Robert John O’Neill.
first applicants’ claim against the fund is allowed in the sum of
$17,000.00.
persons liable for the first applicants’ financial loss are O’Neill
Holdings Group Pty Ltd and Robert John O’Neill.
