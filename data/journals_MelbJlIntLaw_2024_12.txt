I Introduction:
Australia’s Extractive Interest
The centrality of extractive industry to Australian political and economic
history is well known.
The influence of
extractive interests on environmental and economic policy has been a theme of
heated political debate at both state
and federal levels for decades. However,
the way in which extractive concerns have played into Australia’s
engagements with
international law is a question less considered. The extent to
which the federal government’s identification of the national
with the interests of extractive industry influences its international conduct
was laid bare in Timor-Leste’s proceedings
against Australia in the
International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) between 2013 and
Australia’s alleged espionage in
2004 conducted against newly independent Timor-Leste during negotiations over
Timor Sea boundary
delimitation in the Greater Sunrise oil and gas field was
widely condemned as a moral scandal as much as one of law or
coverage treated Australia’s aggressive pursuit of extractive rights
— in that case allegedly beyond the threshold
of legality — as
egregious, but atypical.
That narrative obscures the fact that expanding the field of sovereign
extractive rights and furthering the interests of extractive
industry have long
been organising objectives in Australia’s engagements with international
law and diplomacy. Those objectives
have often placed Australia at odds with the
international community.
From a liberal
internationalist perspective, furthering the economic interests of domestic
industry is a straightforward objective
of any national government’s
engagement with international law, and treaty negotiations in
particular.
As such, prioritising the
interests of one of Australia’s emblematic industries in international
legal negotiations is an uncontroversial
objective. From an anti-colonial
perspective, however, this expansionist approach to sovereign resource rights
— largely concerning
petroleum and gas, but also mineral and biological
resources — is directly continuous with Australia’s carriage of
international
relations in the era of colonial and imperial expansion. That
expansionist approach warrants renewed scrutiny as the regulation of
extraction in domains beyond national jurisdiction resurfaces as an acute
geopolitical fault line in the early 21
century, and tensions over
public and private activity in Antarctica, outer space and the international
seabed escalate.
This article traces the prioritisation of extractive interests in
Australia’s historical approach to international treaty negotiations,
a focus on Australia’s position on resource exploitation in the Antarctic,
the international seabed and outer space between
1958 and 1991. It draws upon
original archival research and mature bodies of scholarship on the legal history
and politics of each
treaty regime. As the international decolonisation
movements of the mid-20
century challenged the legal architecture
of resource rights established under imperial and colonial rule, the legal
status of natural
resources in the Antarctic, oceans beyond national
contention over the mid-to-late 20
century. Between the late 1950s
and the late 1980s, a series of protracted negotiations over the basic
principles that should govern
resource extraction in domains beyond national
as in the case of the seabed and outer space, and pointedly outside
it, as in the case of Antarctica.
Efforts to assert international oversight of extractive activity in domains
beyond national jurisdiction occurred at the intersection
of multiple strands of
century international history. First, unilateral annexation of
territory lost legitimacy after the World War I settlements, in diplomatic
not strictly legal terms. This normative shift intensified doctrinal debates
over the status of the international law of territorial
acquisition, as states
sought to anchor their contested territorial claims in prewar
Secondly, the sharp increase in
formal participation of decolonising states in international organisations and
the creation of negotiating
blocs like the Non-Aligned Movement
(‘NAM’) and the Organisation for African Unity cast further shadow
over the rules
of territorial acquisition and natural resource rights developed
by the European powers over the 19
and early 20
Thirdly, the experiments in internationalisation of territory developed through
the League of Nations (‘League’) mandate
system and the subsequent
UN trusteeship system popularised — even through myriad flaws and
contradictions — the possibility
of multilateral oversight of activity in
contested areas.
Fourthly, the instability inherent in a global economy built through colonial
and imperial expansion was laid bare in a series of
ructions in fossil fuel
supply chains, beginning with the Anglo-Iranian oil crisis of 1951–52 and
culminating in the 1973 oil
crisis resulting from an embargo imposed by the
Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
This raised the
spectre not only of escalating conflict over natural resources, an established
mainstay of inter-imperial trade negotiations,
but also of natural resource
exhaustion. Fifthly, technological and scientific advancements —
themselves inextricable from
the military imperatives of the Cold War —
rendered the prospect of mining the poles, the seabed and near-earth bodies in
a realisable horizon. Lastly, the discourses of environmental protection,
economic development and ‘scientific internationalism’
with strong albeit unstable resonances in postwar development discourse —
began to emerge as organising concerns
of the postwar
over the legal status of domains beyond national jurisdiction in this period
thus presaged many of the debates over substantive
decolonisation, global
political economy and international cooperation on environmental risk that have
come to dominate the field
of international law in the opening decades of the
Against this complex historical backdrop, this article examines
Australia’s carriage of international negotiations over resource
extraction in Antarctica, outer space and the seabed. It focuses on four moments
of treaty negotiation: first, the negotiation of
The Antarctic Treaty
in 1959, against the prospect of UN oversight over the “last
continent”; secondly, the seabed resource debates from the
through to the early 1980s, punctuated by the 1970
Declaration of Principles

Limits of National Jurisdiction
and Part XI of the 1982
United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea
thirdly, the space resources debates from the late 1960s through to the early
1980s, centred around the 1967
Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities
of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and
Other Celestial
Outer Space Treaty
Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other
Celestial Bodies
and lastly, the debate over Antarctic minerals revived in the 1980s, culminating
in the failed 1988
Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource
The article argues that Australia’s foundational objective across all
three treaty frameworks has been to secure and expand
the field of sovereign
resource rights and its right to grant and profit from extractive interests.
Australia’s prioritisation
of its own extractive interests has been
consistent across all three domains. It has leveraged the normative mantles of
scientific internationalism, of the “common heritage of
mankind” (‘CHM’) principle adopted with respect to
international seabed and space, and of environmental protection —
culminating in a moratorium on mining in Antarctica in
the early 1990s —
in service of that foundational objective. In other words, Australia has tended
to adopt environmental, scientific
and common heritage agendas only where doing
so served its underlying goal of securing and expanding the field of sovereign
rights. The article concludes that this history not only tempers
official narratives that figure Australia as a principled defender
internationalist principles with respect to Antarctica, the seabed and space; it
also invites consideration of whether Australia’s
underlying objectives in
its approach to international governance of these domains remain the same, as
all three treaty regimes come
under renewed strain.
II Australian Extractivism
and the Postwar International
The centrality of extractive industry to 20
century Australian
economic and political history is one of the agreed facts of domestic political
culture. There is, however, little
systematic analysis of the extent to which
the domestic dominance of extractive industry has influenced Australia’s
of international law. The federal government’s practice of
refracting questions of international principle through the prism
of sovereign
resource rights established itself early in Australia’s practice of
close identification of the national interest with those of extractive industry
has since manifested itself in multiple ways.
These range from the historical,
including Australia’s early experiences in asserting its independence from
the British imperial
government by claiming ownership of resources in Papua New
Guinea (‘PNG’) and Nauru;
the biographical, involving the career trajectories of highly influential
Australian statesmen who have worked across both government
and extractive
industry, Richard Casey and Alexander Downer among
and to the sociological, reflecting
the extractive industry’s pervasive influence on electoral politics and on

Given the centrality of extractive industry in Australian economic and
political affairs, it is unsurprising — but little remarked
that extractive interests have occupied a central position in Australia’s
carriage of its international obligations.

movements rose to their peak, the various strands of
contest over the legal status of Antarctica, outer space and the seabed were
increasingly woven together in diplomatic debate. Between the 1950s and the
early 1980s, as membership of international organisations
swelled and the
numeric balance of power shifted toward decolonising states, the presumption
that the former colonial and imperial
powers would set the terms of diplomatic
debate was increasingly contested. Most relevantly here, international
administration of
contested territory was increasingly raised by decolonising
states as a mode of Third World participation in — rather than
subjugation
to — international law, as had been the case under the mandate and
trusteeship regimes.
Whilst this article
deals with each regime in loose chronological order, it is important to
acknowledge the cross-pollinating evolution
of all three treaty frameworks.
Particularly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, negotiating parties across all
three frameworks frequently
consisted of the same incumbent governments, advised
by the same departments and the same international lawyers. As a result,
negotiators
and advisers frequently formulated both the
requiring regulation — from territorial annexation, military use and
resource exploitation to environmental protection and
international equity
— and the range of potential
to those problems —
from legal concepts to institutional design — with an eye to their
position in each or all three
of these diplomatic debates.
As a result, this shifting complex of treaty negotiations came to be anchored
around common rhetorical elements. First was the threat
of nuclear war as an
unprecedented and shared regulatory challenge, a framing central to constructing
and maintaining the Cold War.

‘developing’ states, a divide that loosely
and at times only
rhetorically mapped onto the bipolarity between the United States and the Soviet
Union in international organisations.

But the definition and scope
of CHM was worked through at the intersection of all three debates, even if
formally adopted only in
the seabed and space treaty frameworks, and even then
in markedly different ways.
A central contention of this article is that Australia’s position in
the CHM debates of the 1960s and 1970s was informed less
by a consistent
approach to the principle itself than by Australia’s overriding objective
of expanding the field of sovereign
resource claims on the one hand and its

III The Antarctic Treaty
System: Territory against Trusteeship
Scholars of Australia’s relationship to Antarctica have long observed
that the continent has occupied an integral place in the
Australian imperial
before Federation, Antarctica constituted a ‘Southern frontier’ in
the Australian colonies’ expansionist
aspirations.
Moreover, those aspirations
were not limited to a Monrovian exclusion of competing empires or to the
establishment of a regional
influence’.
Rather, Australian
Antarctic aspirations were from the outset for full territorial sovereignty over
an expansive area of the continent
and adjacent waters, and have remained so
ever since. Australia derived its territorial claim from the British imperial
government.
Britain’s formal Antarctic claim was made in 1908 by extending
the scope of its 1833 Falkland Islands claim. The extent of
that extended claim
was clarified in 1917.
A further British
claim was made in 1923 over the Ross Sea sector for administration by New
Zealand, expanding the British claim
to around two thirds of the continent. As
Dominion independence over external affairs solidified over the 1920s, shoring
up the British
Antarctic claim became a key issue in the Imperial Conferences of
1926, 1930 and 1937.
In 1933, the larger
part of the British claim was transferred to Australia, becoming known as the
AAT, spanning just over 40% of

Modes of demonstrating
territorial occupation recognised in international law — including
permanent constructions, sustained
physical presence and evidence of mapping and
surveying — were emphasised within the British Foreign Office from the
century as crucial to maintaining the territorial claim.
However, the status of all claims was complicated further still by the
claims of Argentina and Chile, both of which overlapped with areas of
British claim.
Although these claims were
only made formally as late as the early 1940s, both Argentina and Chile claimed
title derived by succession
of prior Spanish claim and maintained through
consistent activity amounting to
occupation.
After World War II, territorial conflict over Antarctica attracted increasing
international attention. As the new UN system took shape,
former League mandates
were placed under international trusteeship and the
Charter of the United
was declared to apply to all ‘non-self-governing
territories’.
As international
oversight was asserted over colonial territories, all Antarctic claimants were
concerned to establish full sovereign
rights and avoid UN intervention in
Antarctic affairs. The US too was at pains to avoid subjecting the question of
Antarctic governance
to formal international scrutiny, not least by the Soviet

a close associate of Prime

provided a model of internationalised territorial oversight
for Antarctica,
against the prospect of administration by a closed club of imperial claimants.
Menon’s personal advocacy of
global disarmament provided additional
impetus to India’s move. Throughout the 1950s, the Soviet Union alleged

preparations for the
International Geophysical Year (‘IGY’) in
The IGY, a program of global geophysical research activity spearheaded by the
US and managed by the International Council of Scientific
Unions, catalysed two
major Cold War developments: the conclusion of the
Antarctic Treaty
the inauguration of the so-called space age. According to former NASA historian
Roger Launius, the US’ ultimate objective
in promoting the IGY was to
ensure its own free movement in all geophysical domains not already under
settled sovereign control,
including airspace above sovereign jurisdiction and
the Antarctic.
In international legal
terms, the US’ primary aim was to establish a right to full global
satellite reconnaissance on the one
hand, and a right to defend from aerial
attack on the other. According to Launius, US promotion of international
scientific collaboration
during the IGY served as the ‘stalking
horse’ through which those aims could be

Casey’s father had served as Board Chairman of the Mount Morgan Gold Mine
near Rockhampton in Queensland, one of the most productive gold mines in the
world at the time.
As Minister for External
Affairs, Casey vehemently opposed any internationalisation of Antarctic
governance and insisted on protecting
Australia’s sovereign resource
claims in the AAT.
Despite the efforts of Casey, COR and BP, exploratory activity in Antarctica
during the IGY failed to locate significant mineral resources.
The failure of
all claimants to identify exploitable reserves within Antarctic territory
effectively cleared a way for the collaborative
resolution that was to

and the question of the status of mineral resources was omitted from the Treaty
altogether.

use Antarctica for ‘peaceful

militarisation; and ‘[f]reedom of scientific investigation’, meaning

attractive reserves. The legal issue of whether the Treaty’s permissive
norm of ‘scientific exploration’ extended to resource exploration
was left for later debate.
IV The Third United Nations
Conference on the Law of the Sea: Decolonisation, the Continental Margin and
Common Heritage
Australia’s focus on expanding its field of sovereign resource rights
played out in unexpected ways over the following decades,
in treaty negotiations
over resource rights in the law of the sea and in international space law. The
popularisation of a global
imaginary during the IGY — and the related
adoption of scientific internationalism as a cloak for pursuing military and
objectives in the
Antarctic Treaty
— had immediate
impacts on negotiations pertaining to space and the seabed. With respect to
space, the UN resolved to establish
an ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space (‘COPUOS’) in December
Noting the events of the IGY, the ad
hoc Committee was charged with reporting on

auspices to the benefit of States irrespective of the state of their economic
and scientific development
— an inference to
Antarctic Treaty
negotiations, which had
evaded internationalisation in both its institutional and normative dimensions.
With respect to the seabed,
the First UN Conference on the Law of the Sea
(‘UNCLOS I’) was also held in 1958. It resulted in the four
Geneva Conventions
on the territorial sea and contiguous zone, the
continental shelf, the high seas, and fishing and conservation of living
Conventions
Conventions
largely codified existing customary international law, with
expanded rules of border delimitation.
However, the issue of seabed resources beyond national jurisdiction was left
untouched for the same reasons the
Antarctic Treaty
avoided it: as the
International Law Commission noted in its preparatory report, there was little
need to address regulation of resource
extraction in the international seabed as
there was as yet no commercial case for

impetus to convene the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea (‘UNCLOS
III’) arose from this shifting balance
of power within the UN system. That
moment was seized to fateful effect in 1967 by Maltese diplomat Arvid Pardo,
Malta’s first
Permanent Representative to the
Pardo’s famous speech to the
General Assembly — delivered within weeks of the

, with its language of ‘province of all mankind’ coming
into effect in October 1967 — called for international cooperation

exploitation.
In response, the UN
established a ‘Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean

known, drafted the 1970
Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and
the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil thereof, beyond the Limits of National
The 1970 Declaration
asserted for the first time that the seabed and its resources ‘were’
‘the common heritage
of mankind’, meaning that all activities,
including resource extraction, were to be carried out under an international
established by treaty, ‘including appropriate international
machinery’.
Over the next two years,
the UN undertook large-scale preparations for UNCLOS
In Australia, the brewing CHM debate seems to have been of little interest to
the government in the early years of UNCLOS
Australia’s central objective in
law of the sea negotiations was to expand the field of sovereign resource rights
by securing
recognition of an extended continental shelf. That objective had
been established under the Gorton (1968–71) and McMahon (1971–72)
governments and was maintained throughout the Whitlam (1972–75) and Fraser
(1975–83) governments. From 1972, the Whitlam
government was focused on
expanding Australia’s sovereign rights to the continental shelf and margin
by whatever extent possible.
Australia’s position centred on an expansive
interpretation of ‘margin’ as defined in the 1958 Geneva
Convention on the Continental Shelf
Given this objective, in the early years of UNCLOS III the Australian delegation
focused on mounting calls for an EEZ of 200 nautical
miles from the coastal
baseline, and specifically on the consequences of a universal EEZ on the
prospects of securing recognition
of an expansive continental margin. Due to
exploratory information provided by the petroleum and gas industry, Australia

petroleum and gas on the North West Shelf of the Australian
continent, extending

thereby grounded Australia’s sovereign territorial claim in resource

potential changes in

Portugal withdrew from East Timor in 1975, the Whitlam government infamously
threw its support
behind Indonesia’s violent occupation rather than the
Timorese independence movement. These events are well known due to
later institution of ICJ proceedings against Australia for its
later conclusion of a treaty with Indonesia regarding ownership of
resources in
the Timor Sea.
The Whitlam
government’s rhetorical support for New International Economic Order
(‘NIEO’) principles of political

leveraged NIEO rhetoric less in solidarity with the right of decolonising
peoples to economic self-determination than in
pursuit of its own ownership and
control over natural resources in areas liable to fall within the territorial
waters or EEZs of
its decolonising neighbours.
Archival records show that Australia’s negotiating position throughout
UNCLOS III remained fixed on recognition of an expanded
continental shelf and
margin, and the resolution of potential conflict with neighbouring EEZs. The
Department of Foreign Affairs
(‘DFA’) was as alert to the
significance of the continental shelf and EEZ debates for Australia’s
resources claims
in the AAT as it was for those relating to the North West
Shelf. As such, debate in the First Committee at UNCLOS III over a seabed
resources regime — and the legal content of the CHM principle — was
a secondary concern. While the Australian delegation
monitored US and Soviet
critique of the CHM concept closely, the package deal approach adopted at UNCLOS
III meant that Australia
stayed open to accepting a CHM regime for the
international seabed as a bargaining tool in its continental shelf and EEZ
The DFA and Australia’s
lead negotiator, Keith Brennan, used Australia’s participation in First
Committee debates over
the institutionalisation of CHM for seabed resources to
head off any discussion of applying the CHM principle to Antarctic resources,
and to promote the interests of domestic extractive industry, leading a campaign

: Common Heritage and Australian Uranium
Law of the sea negotiations largely overshadowed parallel negotiations over
space resources, which occurred in the wings of the UN
across the 1970s and
early 1980s. Both seabed and space treaty regimes ultimately adopted the
principle of common heritage, but the
legal expression of the principle differed
markedly between them. Australia supported the space resources settlement in the
Moon Agreement
before the seabed resources settlement, making the
former its first official endorsement of the CHM principle. But even in the case
of space, Australia’s objective in acceding to the treaty was to expand
Australia’s sovereign resource base. Whilst now
regarded as a contemporary
if not futuristic concern, the regulation of resource exploitation on the moon
and near bodies had been
under debate in the UN COPUOS from its establishment in
1958. The strong association of the Antarctic with outer space instilled
IGY spurred speculative consideration of the legal status of space resources,
well in advance of the technological capacity
to exploit them. In 1960, the
International Institute of Space Law convened a working group to make proposals
on the legal status
of outer space. Its 1964 report proposed that celestial
bodies or parts thereof should not be subject to ‘national or private
appropriation’, an expansive framing that clearly applied to private
proprietary as well as sovereign territorial

, which declared space the ‘province
of all mankind’ and prohibited national
appropriation,
therefore settled little.
Academic and diplomatic debate on the legality of private appropriation of space
resources intensified
over the late 1960s and 1970s as UNCLOS III negotiations
on the seabed regime progressed. The US view, established during the adoption

that private appropriation of resources once removed was permissible — a

who first suggested in June 1967 that a notion

Following a range of
competing submissions to the COPUOS from Poland, France and the Soviet Union,
concerted debate on the legal
principles to apply to space resources began in
the COPUOS Legal Sub-Committee of in 1972 among 28 member
Australia was an early supporter
of the CHM approach proposed by Argentina along with the US, the UK, Egypt, Iran
and India, as well
as the bulk of developing countries who progressively joined
the COPUOS over the early years. An active member of the COPUOS, the
Union expressed strong suspicion of CHM on account of its imprecision and lack
of practical need to settle an international
regime, submitting its own working
paper in 1973.
Over seven years of debate within the COPUOS Legal Sub-Committee, little
agreement was reached on the adoption or content of a CHM
approach to space
resource utilisation. Over 1978 and 1979, however, an unusual set of events
resulted in the adoption of CHM in
the final form of the treaty. Austria, which
had led the drafting process and strongly supported inclusion of CHM, submitted
a consolidated
draft in 1978 that circumvented disagreement by declaring the
moon and its natural resources the common heritage of mankind, whilst
formulating CHM as ‘find[ing] its expression in the provisions of th[e]
Agreement’.
This formulation was intended to sever space resource negotiations from parallel
negotiations over CHM in the First Committee of
UNCLOS III and any related
attempt to claim customary or
status for the principle. The
Legal Sub-Committee submitted this consolidated draft to the COPUOS in 1979,
which approved the final

were political reasons for this skewed focus: nuclear policy was one of the most
volatile issues Hawke faced in his early years
as Prime Minister, on both
domestic and international fronts. Following his election in March 1983, Hawke
walked a difficult line,
endorsing both nuclear disarmament at international
level, and increased uranium mining in Australia. A lifelong advocate of nuclear
power, Hawke saw a key role for Australia in a global nuclear fuel cycle, a
policy view developed in close concert with the Australian
uranium mining
Hawke’s electoral base was divided on this direction in party policy.
Faced with mass rallies calling for nuclear disarmament
and a ban on uranium in
the first month of government, Hawke and Hayden opted to direct the focus to
Australia’s diplomatic
record on disarmament, appointing Richard Butler as
‘roving’ Ambassador for
Disarmament.
At the same time, Hawke
refused to question the US nuclear build-up under Reagan, or the activity of US
bases on Australian soil;
and at the Labor Party Conference in July 1984 he
moved to relax the Party’s awkward ‘no new mines’ policy to

Antarctic Treaty
had — partly at
Australia’s insistence — avoided reference to resource extraction

freedom of scientific exploration. This
cemented a crucial distinction between the
Antarctic Treaty
and the later
space and seabed regimes in their approaches to resource exploitation. In the
later two treaty frameworks, the norm
of ‘peaceful purposes’
explicitly included both scientific exploration
commercial resource
exploitation, and allowed all states formally equal access for both purposes,

of international oversight to give effect to the

exploration, whilst leaving the question of commercial resource exploitation
unanswered.
The attempt to insulate

preservation of existing sovereign
resource claims in Antarctica; but it
inevitably proved absurd in practice. Exploration for petroleum, gas and mineral

VII Conclusion: Australia
and the Future of Resource Extraction in Domains beyond National
As Shirley V Scott has long noted of the unusual détente established
in the 1959
Antarctic Treaty
, ‘there is no reason to be complacent
as to its future viability or
longevity’.
This could well be
said of all three of the three regimes negotiated between the late 1950s and the
early 1990s to regulate resource
extraction in areas beyond national

, which largely gutted
the CHM principle of any distributive potential, thereby facilitating acceptance
of the comprehensive
From the mid-20
century onward, when common rhetorical elements if not proto-principles could be
discerned across all three domains, the question
of how resource extraction
beyond national jurisdiction should be regulated fractured into three
geophysical- and function-specific
treaty frameworks. For several decades, this
fragmentation worked to stave off open debate within international institutions
the common conceptual, political and ultimately metaphysical problems
of environmental and distributive justice that pertain to resource
exploitation
in all three domains. It also worked to stave off open reckoning, at least
within international institutions, with the
extractive foundations of
century constructs of development, themselves derived from far
older constructs of European imperialism, as Third World Approaches
International Law (‘TWAIL’) and Marxist scholars in international
law have now comprehensively documented.
To that extent, Australia’s consistent prioritisation of sovereign
extractive interests, even where it seemed to adopt the
CHM principle, merely
reflects the broader ascendance of liberal economic development as the
proclaimed normative foundation of postwar
international ordering, at least
between the mid-1940s and the 2010s.
The aim of this article, however, is not to provide a conceptual explanation
of Australia’s carriage of Antarctic, outer space
and seabed negotiations.
It is simply to establish that across all three treaty frameworks, and despite
appearances to the contrary,
Australia has consistently worked to secure and
expand the field of sovereign resource rights. It has leveraged normative
of scientific internationalism, environmental protection and common
heritage in order to pursue that organising objective. Narratives
that champion
Australia’s environmental record in Antarctica and its formal adoption of
CHM with respect to the seabed and
space tend to avoid reckoning with the fact
that environmental, scientific and common heritage justifications can be —
in fact have been — continuous with an approach to international law
that remains at its core extractive and expansionist.
Now is an important moment to reassess both the history and the future of
Australia’s approach to the problem of resource extraction
beyond national
Antarctic Treaty
is now in question, as US hegemony wavers and China and Russia test the limits
of claimant states’ capacity and willingness
