Judgment of
Senior Warden Dr Cannon
1 September
Amalgamation
HALKIAS & DRAZIO ANGELO GALLETTO v THE DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES
& RESOURCES
[2009] SAWC
I note that you can only
amalgamate claims that are contiguous. I am told that these claims are only
connected by one corner and
it is the view of the Department that is not
contiguous. Since returning to my chambers I have now looked at the
and contiguous means ‘sharing a common border’. This
implies a connection at more than corner. Accordingly, I cannot
application.
This is an understandable
mistake by the miners so I order that the court fee be remitted to them. This
application must be dismissed.
