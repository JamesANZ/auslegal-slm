REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON
Hearing 4 January 2008 at Mount Gambier
WIDDISON v CENTRAL CARAVAN PARK (RT07/8310)
APPLICATION LODGED 11 December 2007
ORDERS SOUGHT Reimbursement of rent paid in advance & release of the
RESIDENTIAL PARK TENANCY AGREEMENT DETAILS
Premises: Caravan 13 Central Caravan Park
Krummel Street Mount Gambier SA 5290
Park Owner: Central Caravan Park
Resident: Neville Henry Widdison
Tenancy Commenced: 29 August 2007
Rent: $95.00 per week
Security Bond: $150.00
This is a matter beset by a number of complications. The agreement is dated
28 August 2007, and indicates that Mr Widdison was to
assume occupancy of the
caravan the following day. At that time the applicable law (in all probability)
was the Residential Tenancy
In November 2007 the Residential Parks Act came into effect and that
legislation applies to existing agreements with respect to residential
(see Schedule 1).
I am satisfied that this is a residential park tenancy agreement. Mr
Widdison rented an on site van, because he needed accommodation
in a hurry. His
evidence is that the Housing Trust provided him with funds for the purpose of
emergency accommodation.
Mr Widdison has filed his application by use of a Form 7 under the
Residential Tenancies Act
. That is not the correct form as required by the
Residential Parks Act. Section 104 of that Act requires an application to be in
the approved form. However Section 115 of that Act gives me power to cure
irregularities. I propose to exercise that power in this
particular case. It
seems to me that all the pertinent information is set out in the form filed by
Mr Widdison, and his application
is reasonably clear. I cannot see there would
be any prejudice to the respondent by the use of the wrong form. This is a
minor matter, and I can see no practical benefit in making Mr
Widdison file a fresh application, whereas on the other hand the delay
need for a further attendance, and the need for a further hearing would all be
detrimental.
Section 58 of the Parks Act allows a park operator to terminate a tenancy
agreement, with immediate effect, if there is serious misconduct
I note there is a letter on file from the respondent. It is not sworn
evidence, and carries little weight. For what it is worth,
that letter states
that Mr Widdison received three warnings regarding his disruptive behaviour.
Enclosed with the letter was a copy
of a notice purportedly given to Mr Widdison
and dated 7 December 2007, requiring him to vacate.
Mr Widdison denies that he was drunk, but accepts that he may have been
associating with some disorderly people. He did vacate as
required by the park
operator. He does not impugn that decision.
Mr Widdison’s first issue relates to rent that he has paid. There is a
copy of a tax invoice issued by Central Caravan Park,
dated 29 November 2007.
Mr Widdison tells me that shows that he paid two weeks rent on that day, and he
states that the rent was
for the two weeks following 29 November 2007. There
are also some miscellaneous payments, but he does not object to those. Mr
evidence is that he was paid up to 13 December 2007, but was
ejected on 7 December 2007. He wants to be refunded for the intervening
I will accept his evidence as to the payment of rent in advance. By my
reasoning his rent was due on 29 November 2007; and erring
in favour of the park
operator I will base my calculation upon the assumption that Mr Widdison should
pay rent for 7 December 2007.
I calculate that he should be refunded for five
days rental, which is an amount of $67.85.
Mr Widdison had little information regarding the bond. He had no document to
show the amount of the bond. I do note that the “personal
particulars” document issued by the park operator has a hand written
notation stating that: “SAHT pd bond plus one week
Mr Widdison believes that the bond was an amount of $150.00. He thought the
Housing Trust supplied a cheque to the park operator,
but he cannot be sure of
It appears that the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs has no record of having
received a bond with respect to this agreement, and I
assume that the park
operator has retained the bond.
I note the “personal particulars” form carries a note that if the
tenant is evicted then the bond is not refunded.
I will frame the order in such a way that the park operator is to refund to
the Housing Trust any bond that it has received in relation
to this residential
park tenancy agreement. If there is a dispute or a problem with respect to the
bond, then either party may apply
for further orders.
I do not know whether “Central Caravan Park” is a registered
business name, or the name of a company. The tax invoice
issued by Central
Caravan Park carries an ABN. I presume it to be a registered business name, but
again if there is some difficulty
then the parties may apply for further orders
of variation of these orders.
I note the letter from the Residential Park dated 1 January 2008. That
letter is signed by Katie and Phil McLean who apologise for
not being able to
attend at the hearing and ask that I take into account the matters set out in
the letter. I repeat my comment
that the letter is not sworn evidence, and
therefore carries very little weight. However I have given what regard I can to
One of the matters raised by the caravan park is that the mattress in Mr
Widdison’s caravan was stained. Mr Widdison says that
occurred when there
was a “park invasion”. He says that somewhere in the past six or
eight weeks a group of people were
looking for the person staying in the next
van. This group was operating a fire hose, and playing it on the other van, and
squirted the van that Mr Widdison had occupied. Some water came through
the open window and wet the mattress.
On the evidence before me, I cannot find that Mr Widdison is responsible for
the staining of the mattress.
order that the Central Caravan Park of Mount Gambier (or the owners of that
park) refund to Mr Neville Widdison (of Unit 4, 63 Sturt
Street Mount Gambier)
the sum of $67.85 forthwith.
order that the Central Caravan Park (or the owners thereof) forthwith refund to
the South Australian Housing Trust the amount paid
by the South Australian
Housing Trust, or guaranteed by it, in relation to this tenancy
I give liberty to either party to apply for ancillary orders,
or a variation in the nature of a correction of these orders.
