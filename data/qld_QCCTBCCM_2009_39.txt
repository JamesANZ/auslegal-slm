Introduction
is a case where in the ordinary course I would be minded to order that the
applicants pay the costs of the respondents that have
been thrown away by reason
of their conduct of these proceedings.
present situation is that an application has been brought by the applicants for
a review of the kind referred to in
sections 130
Corporate and Community Management Act 1997
. In these proceedings, the
respondents have raised objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to
conduct such a review. I have

it determines that there is
no jurisdiction. The question is whether it has an
interim power to order costs in the course of making its determination on the

do so. An eventual finding of no jurisdiction
would, I think, falsify any
earlier order that had been made for costs.
these circumstances, what I propose to do is to reserve the respondents’
costs thrown away today and indicate that, if there
is jurisdiction, to award
them and I find so in due course, I will be minded to do so on an indemnity
