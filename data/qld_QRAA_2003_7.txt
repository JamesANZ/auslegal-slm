[2003] QRAA 07
: 13 March 2003
Mr Jay Carl
APPEAL FROM
A decision of the Queensland Harness
Racing Board pursuant to Rule 168(1) of the Rules of Harness
BREACH OF RULE
APPEARANCES
: Mr Scott Neaves with the approval of the
Authority appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr Norm Torpey, Chairman
of Stewards, appeared on behalf of the Respondent.
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen - Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an appeal by Mr Jay
Carl Bellamy against the decision of the Queensland Harness Racing Board
Stewards that he was in breach
of Rule 168(1) of the Rules of Harness Racing
which provide:
“A person shall not before, during or after a race
drive in a manner which in the opinion of the stewards is careless, reckless,
incompetent, intimidatory, foul or likely to endanger persons or
The charge against Mr Bellamy arose out of an incident
which occurred during the running of race 3 at the Albion Park Raceway on
25 February 2003. Mr Bellamy was the driver of Spotthechamp and the
Stewards allege that Mr Bellamy was careless in changing the
position of
Spotthechamp on the turn into the front straight at about the 180-metre point of
the race. The Stewards allege that
as a result of the movement of Spotthechamp
the horse One Toothleft which was driven by Mrs Lola Kunde became unbalanced and
At the inquiry held after the race both Mr Bellamy and Mrs
Kunde gave evidence of the incident. Mr Bellamy’s evidence was to
effect that he did not push his horse out quickly but took his time and came out
gradually around the turn. He states that while
there may have “just been
a nick” that could not be the cause of why One Toothleft broke gait. He
was of the view that
the horse had tired at that time and the contact did not
make any difference.
Mrs Kunde supported Mr Bellamy’s drive saying
that she felt that Mr Bellamy had done the right thing and probably to some
the incident was her horse’s fault as he has an action of swirling
his legs wide behind. Mrs Kunde did state there was “only
slight brush”. Her evidence was to the effect that you could not blame Mr
Bellamy for the horse galloping.
In Mr Neaves’ submissions to the
Authority he stressed Mrs Kunde’s evidence should be taken by the
Authority to show that
Mr Bellamy was not careless in his drive. Mr Neave also
presented to the Authority submissions that One Toothleft had a bad history
that on 28 January 2003 he had broken his gait and was stood down until he
The video of the race was shown from three different angles
and the Authority found it difficult to view contact from the video.
Notwithstanding that, it is clear from the evidence at the inquiry that there
was some contact.
Mr Torpey submitted that the cause of One Toothleft
breaking was the contact which caused Mr Bellamy’s movement and the
were right to bring the charge as it deprived One Toothleft of being
competitive during the final stages of the race.
The Authority accepts
that submission and is of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence from the
inquiry to show a breach of
Rule 168(1). The appeal against the finding by the
Stewards is dismissed.
While a period of suspension is usually the
relevant penalty for a breach of this Rule in view of the minor nature of this
the Authority is of the opinion that a Reprimand together with a fine
of $250.00 is the more appropriate penalty.
