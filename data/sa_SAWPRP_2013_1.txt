REMARKS ON ADJOURNMENT
application came before me for the first time today. The application is dated 30
November 2012, and seeks a review pursuant to
section 72M of the
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
(“the Act”), of a
decision made by the WorkCover Corporation of South Australia
(“WorkCover”) in relation
to the assessment of the applicant
employer’s premium for the 2012-13 year, as embodied in initial premium
calculations dated
15 August 2012. The calculation has taken into account a
claim the status of which is disputed by the employer.
make the following remarks in the hope of assisting the parties either to
resolve the dispute consensually, or to help focus their
thoughts on the issues
as I perceive them.
only documentation before me at this stage is the application for review,
prepared by Mr D.L. Putland, Member Counsel, Master
Builders South Australia,
and WorkCover’s reconsideration document, prepared by Mr S. Makai, Senior
Information Officer. It
should not therefore be thought that I have drawn any
final conclusions as to any particular facts. This is the task of the full
on a final hearing.
said that, it seems that the contentious claim arose from an ankle injury that
occurred when a vehicle driven by a worker (it
is not yet clear to me whether
this was the worker’s own vehicle or a company vehicle) ran out of petrol
and he attempted to
push it to the edge of the road.
applicant argues that the injury was not compensable. In the application for
review, Mr Putland has given several reasons for
the employer’s belief. It
is not necessary for me to detail these at this stage.
effect, the applicant is seeking a ruling from the Panel that the claim should
not form part of the employer’s claims history
because it should not have
been accepted by WorkCover’s claims agent.
6A of the Act (headed
Dispute Resolution
) seems to reserve jurisdiction
over disputes as to whether an injury is or is not compensable to the Workers
Compensation Tribunal.
A decision on a claim for compensation is a reviewable
decision (section 89A). The employer from whose employment the injury is alleged
to have arisen is automatically a party to any dispute (section 89). Such an
employer is specifically entitled to lodge a notice
of dispute (section 90).
This Panel wrote in
Wami Kata Old Folks Home v. WorkCover
“The reason we found the witness
statements to be of little assistance is simple. At best, if we adopted
everything the employer
contended about them, they might establish some doubt
not an issue for us. Section 90 of the Act clearly reserves jurisdiction to hear
a dispute over the acceptance (or non-acceptance)
of a claim to the Workers
Compensation Tribunal, and, moreover, in this case the employer actually
exercised that right ... The way
in which those proceedings were eventually
disposed of was a matter for the parties and the Tribunal, not a matter for us.
difficulty imagining circumstances in which it would be proper for this
Panel to entertain and act upon a submission that a particular
claim ought not
have been accepted.”
Panel’s ears are not closed to new arguments on this, but I would not want
to mislead the applicant into thinking this long-standing
view of the Panel
could readily be reversed. I appreciate that there is a time limit on lodging
notices of dispute with the Tribunal,
and it is likely that this has expired.
Whether the Tribunal would be likely to grant an application for an extension of
these circumstances is not a matter for me to speculate upon.
the application for review, Mr Putland has also indicated that if the claim was
correctly accepted, it should have been coded as
an unrepresentative injury. In
general, an unrepresentative injury does not form part of an employer’s
claims history. That
a matter that falls within this Panel’s
I understand the definition of “unrepresentative injury” in section
3(1) of the Act, a journey injury is unrepresentative
if it falls under section
real and substantial connection between the accident and the
), but not if it falls under section 30(5)(a) (
journey in the
course of carrying out duties of employment
). WorkCover says this claim
falls under section 30(5)(a). Perhaps the dispute between WorkCover and the
employer arises from a difference
of opinion about the purpose of the
worker’s journey or his destination at the time he sustained his injury.
That may be a
matter for evidence in due course.
the directions hearing today, Mr Putland indicated, and WorkCover agreed, that
it now seems that the claim in question had not
in fact affected the
employer’s premium for 2012-13. However, that view was based on the
preliminary estimates calculated at
the beginning of the year; there was a
possibility that the final hindsight premium calculated at the end of the year
would be different.
Moreover, the claim in question would also, on
WorkCover’s view, form part of the employer’s claims history in
and it remains to be seen, when the 2013-14 initial premium
calculations are issued by WorkCover in August 2013, whether the claim
any impact on that year’s premium if it continues to form part of the
employer’s claims history.
Mr Putland was keen to avoid incurring for his member the costs of a full
hearing if it made no difference to the premium
in the final analysis. In that
event, the application would probably be withdrawn.
my opinion, no significant prejudice is caused to either party by adjourning the
application to a further directions hearing in
late August, by when these
aspects should have been clarified. I so direct.
remarks above are not intended to limit the parties in arguing their respective
cases as they consider appropriate. They do, however,
represent matters that
should be addressed.
consideration of this application is adjourned to
Thursday 29 August
indicate to the parties that if the matter has resolved before that time, there
is no need to attend as long as the registry is
informed. On the other hand, if
for any reason clarification of the impact of the relevant claim on the
employer’s premiums
for both years is not complete by that time, the date
may be changed (with the consent of both parties) by telephone or email
application
to the registry.
