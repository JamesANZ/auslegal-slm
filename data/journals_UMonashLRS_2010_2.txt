PRECEDE: When a power of attorney is used to sell the home of an elderly
testator to pay for their care, a testamentary gift of the
house may survive the
sale. By Matthew Groves
Many things can change between the drafting of a will and the death of a
testator. One increasingly common event is that testators
require specialist
aged care and their only substantial asset – the family home – is
sold to fund that care. These arrangements
can have an unexpected impact on the
will. The doctrine of ademption can cause a specific gift of the house to fail,
though there
is growing recognition of an exception for cases involving the sale
of property made on behalf of an infirm testator.
The principle of ademption
Ademption occurs when property subject to a
specific testamentary gift is not part of the estate when a testator dies. The
operates on the assumption that if the property “cannot be found
... the gift cannot take effect”.
Ademption will not occur if the
property “has been changed in name and form only, but which is
substantially the same thing”.
This can lead to fine distinctions
in cases in which property has changed, but the extent of that change is not
dramatic, such as
the conversion of share options into shares. Real property is
subject to strict rules, especially if that property is endowed in
terms. A specific testamentary gift of real property will fail if the land is
sold by a testator before death even if the
proceeds of sale are either part of
the estate or can be traced. The beneficiary is not entitled to the proceeds of
Ademption will occur even if the sale remains incomplete at
the death of the testator because a valid contract or other transaction
transfer property is sufficient to remove it from the estate and extinguish any
gift of the property.
When testators with capacity sell their home
for any reason, any specific gift of that house will fail. Such cases involve a
straightforward
application of ademption – the property will not be part
of the estate when the testator dies. This problem could be avoided
amending or remaking the will. But in many such cases the testator has lost
capacity – which is why specialist care
is required – and the sale
is conducted by relatives acting under a power of attorney. The testator would
often not consent
to, or even be aware of, the sale. According to the
traditional view of ademption this did not matter; knowledge or intention by
testator was irrelevant. The important question was not whether the testator
intended to extinguish a specific gift by disposing
of the property, but simply
whether the property was part of the estate when the testator died.
Exceptions to ademption
Over time some minor exceptions to ademption arose
that suggested the intention or knowledge of a testator was relevant. One
was any fraudulent or tortious acts to dispose of property without the
knowledge of the testator.
A similar exception extended to fraudulent
actions by an agent of the testator.
These exceptions are consistent
with the proposition that “whether the testator had notice or knowledge of
the facts is a relevant
factor on the question of ademption”.
Dispositions made on behalf of a testator lacking capacity
The case of
took the established exceptions of ademption an
important step further. The testatrix in that case had made a specific gift of
house to two friends who managed her affairs in her later life. When the
textatrix became too frail to live independently, her friends
arranged her move
into care. They also sold the testatrix’s home by exercise of a power of
attorney she had made in their favour.
The money was invested to pay for the
testatrix’s care. After the testatrix died her friends discovered they
were the beneficiaries
of a specific gift of the house. The question before the
court was whether the sale of the house caused ademption of the gift. Thomas
held it did not and did so by drawing together several issues.
Thomas J noted
a division in earlier cases. Some held ademption occurred when property was no
longer part of an estate, no matter
whether the testator knew or consented to
its disposal.
Some held otherwise, partly because the testator had not
intended to extinguish the gift.
Thomas J identified a slightly
different issue when the property had been disposed of by someone acting under a
power of attorney.
The question in such cases was not whether the disposal of
property was valid, but whether it should alter testamentary gifts. Thomas
noted a division of authority in America and Canada on this issue, notably the
question of whether actions of a guardian or attorney
could cause ademption of a
testamentary gift by the person for whom they acted. His Honour drew support
from an American case which
held that such cases should not be decided simply by
asking if the property formed part of the estate at death, but should give some
weight to the intention of the testator.
That case concluded that the
weight of American authority favoured an exception to ademption, for reasons of
fairness and to give
effect to the expressed wishes of the testator. Thomas J
adopted that view.
This exception was soon followed in Western Australia in
Re Hartigan.
In that case the only asset of an elderly testatrix
was her home, on valuable land, which was left to several people. When the sale
of the land was required to fund the care of the testatrix, the public trustee
sought directions on what effect this might have on
the testamentary gift. The
trustee was, unlike the attorneys in
, well aware of the gift.
Parker J held that the reasoning in
was “helpful and
persuasive”. He also noted that the reasoning in
“on the sale of property by a person other than the testator at a time
when the testator is incapable of selling the
property or of altering an
existing will to give effect to the testator’s intentions in changed
circumstances”.
His Honour reasoned that if this reasoning was
accepted there was no obvious distinction between cases in which the seller knew
the will (and the specific gift of property) or was unaware of it.
cases were considered in Victoria by Kaye J
Mulhall v Kelly.
In that case the testatrix had lost capacity
and had her affairs managed by her daughter acting under a power of attorney.
The daughter
sold her mother’s house to fund specialist care for her
mother. Kaye J concluded (at [15]) that
offered a “sound” principle to resolve such cases. It is useful
to note that Kaye J (at [6]) drew attention to the limited
authority on this
issue and expressed concern that the question came before him in the Practice
Court and without an opposing party.
Such remarks suggest the exception to

has met with hesitation elsewhere. In the recent Queensland case of
Ensor v Frisby
McMurdo J held that, but for
and subsequent similar cases she would have held that a specific
testamentary gift of property did not survive the sale of that property
power of attorney. McMurdo J reasoned (at [18]) that the testatrix could easily
have expressed the specific gift as one of
the property and its proceeds if the
property was sold by her attorney. In
Banks v National Westminster Bank
the English High Court did not follow
held that English law allowed an exception only when property was sold without
the consent or authority of the testator. On this
view, disposal of property
under a power of attorney would cause ademption of a specific gift of that

concluded that they should be resolved by parliament rather than the

followed. First, it represents an important and sensible practical step, but
only a modest extension of principle. A Queensland
case explained that
“once an exception is recognised for the unauthorised act of which the
testatrix is unaware, it is a relatively
smaller step to recognise ... an
exception where the act was done under the authority of an enduring power of
Second, testamentary gifts should not be disturbed by
people acting under a power of attorney any more than is strictly necessary,
lest they overturn the previously expressed wishes of the people whose benefit
the power is ultimately for. Third, people who exercise
a power of attorney to
sell the home of an elderly testator are usually that person’s children,
who are making arrangements
for their elderly parent. These children are also
normally the beneficiaries of a testamentary gift of the property that is sold.
It is unfair to all concerned that ademption could occur in such circumstances.
Finally, the cases provide a principle of general
application. The cases concern
family homes and real property, but none have suggested the principle is so
limited. Accordingly,
provides a useful general means to avoid
inadvertent ademption in the affairs of a testator who has lost capacity.
People subject to guardianship orders
The position of people subject to
guardianship orders is clarified by the
Guardianship and Administration Board
1986 (Vic). Section 53(1) of that Act provides that represented people
have “the same interest in any money or other property
arising from any
sale, mortgage, exchange, partition or other disposition” of property made
by the person’s guardian.
The same entitlement is expressly extended to
the heirs, next of kin and other possible beneficiaries of a represented person.
has been held that the purpose of the entitlement granted to heirs is
“to save gifts made by the protected person which would
otherwise be
adeemed by activities carried out not by the protected person, but by his or her
administrator, who may know nothing
of the contents of the protected
person’s will”.
On this view, s53(1) preserves a
testamentary gift made by a person under a guardianship order if the subject
matter of the gift
is disposed of by the guardian.
This provision has
several other useful features. It applies to the sale of property and any
“mortgage, exchange, partition
or other disposition” of property.
The various terms extend the section to virtually any disposition of property
made for value.
The section preserves entitlements to the “money or other
property” arising from a disposition. Accordingly, beneficiaries
a right to the proceeds of the sale of property even if those proceeds are
received in a form other than cash. Under s53(3)
the guardian must maintain
separate records of these proceeds. This obligation enables beneficiaries (and
executors and administrators)
to easily identify the proceeds of the disposal of
any property, to which any entitlement under a testamentary gift applies.
53(1) preserves the rights of executors and administrators which enable
them to take control of and manage the proceeds of the sale
of a represented
person as they would any other asset of a deceased estate. Finally, s53(1) is of
limited application. It applies
only to the property of people subject to a
guardianship order and only to dispositions made by the exercise of guardian
It does not apply to the sale or disposition of property made by other
means, such as a power of attorney.
Avoiding ademption
Ademption can be anticipated when a will is drafted.
Ademption will not occur if a testamentary gift of property is expressed to give
the property or any proceeds of its sale, transfer or other form of disposition.
On this view, any gift of a family home that extended
to the proceeds of the
sale of the home would almost certainly overcome any possible ademption. The
point could be placed beyond
doubt if such a clause were expressed as applying
not simply to the proceeds of the sale but also to any bond, deposit, surety,
or licence that accrues by reason of the sale and investment of the
proceeds of the property. If a testamentary gift is expressed
in such terms,
particularly a gift of the family home, the beneficiaries would take whatever
remains of the proceeds of sale on the
death of the testator.
could also be avoided by an amendment to the
Instruments Act
which mirrored the protection given by the
Guardianship and Administration
1986 (Vic). Such an amendment could operate when testators lose
capacity and have their affairs managed by someone acting under a
attorney. When someone acting under such a power sells or disposes of the
testator’s property, it is usually done
for the benefit of the testator
(to either pay for nursing home or other aged care, and also to relieve the
testator of the cost
of maintaining a house he or she no longer lives in). An
appropriately drafted amendment to the
Instruments Act
(Vic) could
preserve the entitlements of beneficiaries of a testamentary gift in property
sold under a power of attorney as occurs
under guardianship legislation. There
is no obvious reason why the entitlements of beneficiaries should vary depending
on the legislation
under which property is disposed of. Such an amendment would
also have the advantage of clarifying the issue for testators, beneficiaries
the lawyers who advise them.
