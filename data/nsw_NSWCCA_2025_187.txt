[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
The applicant, ZBJ, was convicted following a trial by jury of maintaining an
unlawful sexual relationship with his daughter, who
was a child under 16 years
of age, contrary to
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW), committed
between January 2007 and May 2008. He was sentenced by Culver DCJ (the trial
judge) to 18 years imprisonment with
a non-parole period of 11 years, commencing
on 23 February 2023.
The applicant, who appeared on his own behalf, sought leave to appeal against
conviction and sentence. He challenged the conduct of
his trial counsel, of the
Crown prosecutor, and of the trial judge, alleged numerous miscarriages of
justice, and contended that
was unconstitutional. He also submitted that
the verdict was unreasonable and that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
The grounds of appeal required consideration of matters of principle
including the following:
The role of
defence counsel in a criminal trial: [136]-[147], [331]-[336].
The difference
between fresh and new evidence on appeal: [151].
Admissibility of
complaint evidence: [225]-[232].
The role and
responsibilities of a prosecutor: [238]-[330].
Alleged bias by
trial judge; waiver: [340]-[344].
applicable to unreasonable verdict ground: [354]-[359].
(Adamson JA, Chen and Rigg JJ agreeing)
dismissing the
(1) None of the applicant’s complaints disclosed legal
or factual error. The constitutional challenge failed. Leave to appeal
conviction and sentence was refused and the appeal dismissed.
(2) The elements of an offence under
were different
from earlier statutory offences. The criterion of liability for an offence under
is the maintenance of an unlawful relationship rather than the particular
unlawful acts which constitute the relationship: [26]-[30].
(3) The effect of
, either in terms or in the context
of other statutory provisions, was not to deprive the applicant of a fair trial.
Nor was its effect
to allow for an offender to be punished for offences which
had not been charged: [46]-[59].
Section 108C
Evidence Act 1995
which permitted expert evidence regarding the credibility of witnesses to be
given, did not compromise the essential features
of a trial by jury by educating
the jury as to possible misconceptions which may, absent such evidence, have
affected the jury’s
assessment of the evidence of complainants:
: ZBJ (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against, and appeals, his
conviction, following a trial by jury, of a single offence against
of maintaining an unlawful
sexual relationship with a child under 16 years of age, who was his natural
daughter (the complainant)
between 1 January 2007 and 17 May 2008 (the charge
period). He also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Culver
DCJ (the trial judge) on 4 November 2022 of 18 years imprisonment with a
non-parole period of 11 years which commenced on 23 February
2023 and will
expire on 22 February 2041. The applicant will first be eligible for parole on
22 February 2033.
Crown case at trial, which was, as the jury’s verdict indicates, accepted
by the jury, was that the applicant maintained
an unlawful sexual relationship
with the complainant from the time she was 14 years old until she was 16 years
old. While the prosecution
evidence was that the unlawful sexual relationship
continued after the complainant’s 16th birthday, the Crown acknowledged
that this evidence fell outside the age limit in
The principal witness
in the prosecution case was the complainant. The evidence of her mother (who was
still married to the applicant
during the charge period) supported the
prosecution case. The prosecution also adduced substantial complaint evidence
from friends
of the complainant, a psychologist and a former boyfriend. The
applicant gave evidence in his own case denying the charge. He also
character evidence from his brother. More detail as to the evidence at trial
will be provided later in these reasons in relation
to particular grounds.

the appeal. He seeks leave to appeal on the following

applicant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence on the following
grounds, which will be addressed after the appeal against
conviction:
Sentencing appeal
1. Counsel incompetence caused miscarriage of justice;
2. The sentencing judge improperly based the sentence on the
number and frequency of illegal acts;
3. The defence were not given sufficient time to prepare,
causing significant forensic disadvantage;
4. The given sentence is manifestly excessive;
5. The sentencing judge failed to take into account
circumstances of this particular case;
6. No objections were made to the VIS by the defence
7. The Crown prosecutor breached his duty of fairness;
8. The Crown prosecutor caused substantial miscarriage of
justice by failing to present the whole evidence.
turning to the way in which the trial was conducted (which is the subject of
several grounds of appeal against conviction),
I propose to address ground 12 on
the conviction appeal.
Whether s 66EA is constitutional (ground
support of this ground, the applicant submitted:
... [s] 66EA makes it unnecessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt all charged
elements. This means it is not necessary to try the
accused on every charged
element. This deprives him of his right to a trial by jury guaranteed by the
Constitution
oral submissions, the applicant developed the following three
sub-grounds:
(1) in combination with other legislative amendments, s 66EA deprived an accused
of a fair trial;
(2) s 66EA was arbitrary in that it permitted punishment for acts which have not
been charged and for which the accused had not been
convicted; and
(3) an accused’s right to trial by jury for an offence under s 66EA was
unacceptably compromised because of provisions which
permitted expert evidence
to be given to remove common misconceptions held by members of the community
of sexual abuse.
66EA relevantly provides:
66EA Persistent sexual abuse of a child
(1) An adult who maintains an unlawful sexual
relationship with a child is guilty of an offence.
Maximum penalty—Imprisonment for life.
unlawful sexual
relationship
is a relationship in which an adult engages in 2 or
more unlawful sexual acts with or towards a child over any period.
(4) In proceedings for an offence under this section,
the prosecution—
(a) is not required to allege the particulars of
any unlawful sexual act that would be necessary if the act were charged as a
separate offence, and
(b) is required to allege the particulars of the
period of time over which the unlawful sexual relationship existed.
(5) In order for the accused to be convicted of an
offence under this section—
(a) the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that the evidence establishes that an unlawful sexual relationship
(b) the jury is not required to be satisfied of the
particulars of any unlawful sexual act that it would have to be satisfied
the act were charged as a separate offence, and
(c) the members of the jury are not required to
agree on which unlawful sexual acts constitute the unlawful sexual
relationship.
(6) In proceedings for an offence under this section,
the judge must inform the jury of the requirements of subsection (5).
(8) A court, when imposing a sentence for an offence
under this section constituted by an unlawful sexual relationship that existed
wholly or partly before the commencement of the relevant amendments, must take
into account (but is not limited by) the maximum penalty
for the unlawful sexual
acts engaged in by the accused during the period in which the unlawful sexual
relationship existed.
(13) If on the trial of a person charged with an offence
under this section the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven
satisfied that the person has, in respect of any of the occasions relied on as
evidence of the commission of the offence under
this section, committed an
unlawful sexual act, the jury may acquit the person of the offence charged and
find the person guilty
of that unlawful sexual act. The person is liable to
punishment accordingly.
(14) Proceedings for an offence under this section may
only be instituted by or with the approval of the Director of Public
Prosecutions.
(15) In this section—
means a person who is of or above the age of 18
means a person who is under the age of 16 years.
unlawful sexual act
means any act that constitutes, or would
constitute (if particulars of the time and place at which the act took place
were sufficiently
particularised), any of the following offences—
(a) an offence under section 61I, 61J, 61JA, 61K,
61KC, 61KD, 61KE, 61KF, 66A, 66B, 66C, 66D, 66DA, 66DB, 66DC, 66DD, 66DE, 66DF,
66F or 80A,
(b) an offence under a provision of this Act set
out in Column 1 of Schedule 1A,
(c) an offence of attempting to commit an offence
referred to in paragraph (a) or (b),
(d) an offence under a previous enactment that is
substantially similar to an offence referred to in paragraphs (a)–(c),
(e) an offence under the law of a place outside New
South Wales that would, if it had been committed in New South Wales, be an
offence referred to in paragraphs (a)–(d).
order to prove that the accused is guilty of an offence under s 66EA, the
prosecution must prove that the accused, being an adult
(defined as someone of
or about 18 years of age), maintained an unlawful sexual relationship (a
relationship that involved two or
more unlawful sexual acts over a period) with
the complainant who was a child (defined as someone under the age of 16
66EA in its current form (which commenced on 1 December 2018) was inserted into
following a recommendation by the Royal Commission into
Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: see the discussion in
(2024) 278 CLR 276
[2024] HCA 5
) at [48]-[54]
(Gordon, Steward and Gleeson JJ). It was also designed to overcome the decision
of the High Court in
Chiro v The Queen
(2017) 260 CLR 425
[2017] HCA 37
) at [49] (Kiefel CJ, Keane and Nettle JJ) and [59] (Bell J) which
held that it was necessary for the jury to be unanimous about each
underlying offences particularised by the Crown. So much is clear from the
s 66EA(5)(c)
, as explained in the Second Reading Speech to the
Criminal Legislation Amendment (Child Sexual Abuse) Bill 2018
which, when enacted, amended s 66EA. The Honourable Mark Speakman, Attorney
General said (New South Wales Legislative Assembly,
Parliamentary Debates
(Hansard), 6 June 2018 at 5):
The new section 66EA will provide that it is an offence to maintain an unlawful
sexual relationship with a child under 16. A person
will have maintained an
unlawful sexual relationship if they have engaged in two or more unlawful sexual
acts with a child. The prosecution
will be required to specify over what period
the unlawful sexual relationship is alleged to have occurred, but will not be
to specify the particulars of the unlawful sexual acts with the same
degree of detail as they would if the acts were charged as separate
offences. The jury will be required to unanimously agree beyond reasonable
doubt that the unlawful sexual relationship took place,
but will not be required
to necessarily agree on the same unlawful acts that make up the relationship.
provisions were enacted by the legislatures of other States (see s 229B of the
Criminal Code
Criminal Law
Consolidation Act 1935
authority concerning s 66EA or equivalent provisions in other jurisdictions
turning to the three sub-grounds of ground 12, it is useful to refer to relevant
authority on the constitutionality of s 66EA
(or its equivalents) and its
operation as some, if not all, of the submissions put by the applicant have been
determined adversely
to him by these decisions.
Constitutional
R v CAZ (2012)
constitutionality of the equivalent Queensland provision was challenged in
[2012] 1 Qd R 440
[2011] QCA 231
) which, like s 66EA,
expressly provided that it was not necessary for the jury to be satisfied of the
commission of the same unlawful
acts. The offender relied on two grounds: first,
that the abrogation of the requirement to give particulars compromised
fairness to an extent unacceptable in a criminal trial; and, second,
that the abrogation of the requirement (articulated in
jury be unanimous as to the same unlawful sexual acts was contrary to Chapter
III of the Commonwealth
Constitution
and, in particular, to
which provided
that trials on indictment of Commonwealth offences be by jury.
first ground was dismissed on the basis that, although the requirement for
particulars had been modified by the equivalent of
s 66EA(4)(a), there was,
nonetheless, a requirement to provide particulars under s 66EA(4)(b) which was
sufficient to accord procedural
fairness to an accused. Fraser JA, in dismissing
the first ground, noted, at [40]:
... The common law rule which requires the prosecution to particularise alleged
offences fulfils one of the requirements of natural
justice or, as it is now
more commonly called, procedural fairness. ... It is therefore not difficult to
accept that the application
of the rules of procedural fairness is one of the
defining characteristics of a court in which federal jurisdiction is vested.
(Footnotes omitted.)
JA also said, at [42] (in a passage relied on by the applicant):
For these reasons I would accept that State legislation which denied to a State
court in which federal jurisdiction was vested the
power to order the
prosecution to supply to the defendant particulars of an offence charged against
State legislation which were
necessary to fulfil the requirements of procedural
fairness of a trial in that court would be constitutionally invalid. Such
legislation
would require the court to conduct a trial which was
“repugnant to the judicial process in a fundamental degree.” It
would so distort the “institutional integrity” of the court that it
“no longer exhibits in some relevant respect
those defining
characteristics which mark a court apart from other decision-making
(Footnotes omitted.)
Honour said, of the exemption from the requirement in the equivalent of
s 66EA(4)(a) to provide particulars that would be necessary
if the unlawful
act were separately charged:
47 The prosecution may therefore be directed to provide
particulars of the alleged relationship, including as to the nature of
unlawful sexual acts from which the prosecution infers the alleged relationship.
The exemption from giving particulars is limited
to a dispensation from giving
the particulars of each unlawful sexual act “that would be necessary if
the act were charged
as a separate offence”. Subject only to that
qualification, the District Court remains empowered by s 573 of the Code [the
equivalent of s 66EA], to “direct particulars to be delivered to the
accused person of any matter alleged in the indictment”
“adjourn the trial for the purpose of such delivery.”
48 Those particulars should inform a defendant of the essential
allegations of fact made by the prosecution in sufficient detail
to enable the
defendant to understand and to meet the charge. An example is provided by the
particulars supplied by the prosecution
in this case, which were attached to the
appellant’s outline of submissions. It is sufficient in that respect to
refer to the
particulars of the count involving D. The particulars of that count
appear in Annexure A to this judgment.
second ground was also dismissed. Fraser JA noted that
Commonwealth offences but not State offences and said at [53]:
In any event, s 229B does not purport to dispense with trial by jury. Indeed,
s 229B expressly contemplates trial by jury and requires
jury unanimity
upon the essential allegation that the defendant maintained a sexual
relationship with a child that involved more
than one unlawful sexual act. The
appellant argued that a direction to the jury (in conformity with s 229B(3))
that all jurors must
be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of one or more
unlawful sexual acts, but (in conformity with s 229B(4)(c)) not necessarily of
the same acts, is inconsistent with the conventional directions that the
prosecution must prove each element of the offence beyond
reasonable doubt
before it may convict and that the jury’s verdict in respect of each
offence must be unanimous. There is no
such conflict.
The jurors could be
unanimously satisfied that the defendant maintained an unlawful sexual
relationship with the child involving more
than one unlawful sexual act whilst
at the same time disagreeing about which two or more of numerous alleged
unlawful sexual acts
were proved beyond reasonable doubt
(Footnotes omitted and emphasis added.)
Honour concluded at [55]:
In my opinion, s 229B does not work such a serious diminution upon the necessary
extent of particularisation of the offence, the
usual requirement for jury
unanimity (or majority verdicts in certain cases), or other procedures designed
to ensure a fair trial,
as to justify the conclusion that the trial court no
longer exhibits any of the defining characteristics which mark it apart from
other decision-making bodies. I would hold that s 229B of the Code is not
constitutionally invalid on any of the grounds argued by
the appellant.
application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused:
[2012] HCATrans 244.
Morton (Pseudonym) v R
Morton (Pseudonym) v R
[2025] SASCA 29
, the appellant appealed against
his conviction of an offence under s 50(4)(c) of the
Australian equivalent of s 66EA). One of his grounds of appeal was that
s 50(4)(c) was unconstitutional since, by allowing
for minority verdicts,
it impermissibly interfered with the institutional integrity of the higher
courts of this State in the exercise
of their jurisdiction to hear and determine
charges of sexual abuse of a child.
South Australian Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, following
this ground, it held that the element which was required to be proved was that
there was an unlawful sexual relationship between
the appellant and the
complainant. This required the prosecution to establish the commission of two or
more unlawful sexual acts.
However, it was not necessary for the jury to agree
on the evidential foundation which proved this element, as long as it was
that the appellant had maintained such a
relationship.
Challenges to the maximum penalty
, the High Court rejected the appellant’s argument that the
maximum penalty for the existing s 66EA offence had been increased
retrospectively (from 25 years’ imprisonment to life imprisonment). It
found that the new s 66EA created a
retrospective offence which
carried life imprisonment: [32] (Gageler CJ and Jagot J) and [65] (Gordon,
Steward and Gleeson JJ). The
Court held that the new s 66EA offence (maintaining
an unlawful sexual relationship with a child) was separate and distinct from
previous s 66EA offence which provided that a “person who, on 3 or more
separate occasions occurring on separate days during
any period, engages in
conduct in relation to a particular child that constitutes a sexual offence is
liable to penal servitude for
25 years” (the predecessor offence). The
constitutionality of the provision was not otherwise
challenged.
The operation of s 66EA
way in which s 66EA operates has been considered by this Court. The following
examples were referred to by the applicant in support
of his challenge, although
this Court did not hold that s 66EA was invalid.
[2022] NSWCCA 142
(2022) 300 A Crim R 1
), this Court
applied s 66EA and allowed a Crown appeal against sentence. The applicant relied
on observations made by the Court about
the operation of the section in support
of his argument that s 66EA was unconstitutional because it created
unfairness.
[66], Fagan J (Harrison and Wright JJ agreeing) said:
In a prosecution under s 66EA, the fact that the jury need only be unanimous as
to the maintenance of a sexual relationship without
having to make unanimous
findings about any specific sexual acts has the consequence that upon a verdict
of guilty being returned
and the jury being discharged there has been no
determination of any of the facts that must be ascertained in order to assess,
meaningfully,
what the offender is to be punished for. ...
Honour also said:
75 This case ... illustrates how [s 66EA] has worked a less
than transparent shift of decision-making, on very significant questions
criminal culpability, from jury to judge.
76 The effect of a Crown election to lay a charge under s 66EA
is to deny the accused trial by jury on specific allegations of
sexual acts; to
have the accused tried by jury on a threshold, generalised issue of whether a
sexual relationship was maintained;
then to have specific allegations of what he
is to be punished for litigated for the first time in a post-conviction hearing
sentencing judge alone. ...
77 Certainly it is commonplace, as observed by Gleeson CJ,
Gummow and Hayne J in
Cheung v The Queen
, that “the issues resolved
by the jury’s verdict may not include some matters of potential importance
to an assessment
of the offender’s culpability”. The significant
innovation in s 66EA is that it leaves everything of substance to be
decided by judge alone in the sentence hearing. The only prerequisite is a
guilty verdict that is both obscure as to the scope of
the wrongful conduct that
constituted the relationship and explicitly lacking unanimous jury acceptance of
even one or two specific
alleged acts.
RA v R (2024)
[2024] NSWCCA 149
, the appellant argued that the sentencing judge
erred by not identifying the particularised unlawful sexual acts when imposing a
sentence. This Court held that this was not necessary since the charged offence
was the maintenance of an unlawful relationship with
a child: [92] (Wilson J,
Adamson JA and Dhanji J agreeing but both writing separately). Dhanji J
addressed the different considerations
which arise under s 66EA and summarised
the applicable principles as follows:
161 ... In the circumstances of a charge or charges relating to
a particular act, it is plain that it would not be proper to sentence
an offender for acts with respect to which they were not convicted. Where,
however, the charge relates to maintaining a relationship
with a particular
quality, it is not apparent that the same issue arises.
162 In the present case, there was no submission that the
sentence resulted in the applicant being punished for offences with respect
which he had not been convicted. Nor could there be. Having regard to the terms
of the offence, and the nature of the offence
as informed by the presence of s
66EA(9) and (10), there is no question of the applicant having been sentenced
for offences with
respect to which he had not been convicted in breach of the
principle in
The Queen v De Simoni
163 Clearly, there is the potential for many more instances of
a particular sexual offence to have been committed than is required
section. There may be difficulties in ensuring an offender is not sentenced on a
vague or uncertain basis as to the extent
of the criminality engaged in. But
determining the facts on which an offender is to be sentenced is a commonplace
occurrence. Insofar
as the nature and frequency of sexual offending within the
period encompassed by the charge is in issue, that is to be determined
application of orthodox principles set out in the authorities, most notably

light of these authorities, I turn to the applicant’s three sub-grounds in
support of ground 12.
The applicant’s constitutional
challenges to s 66EA (ground 12)
(1) Alleged effect of depriving an accused of a fair
applicant argued that the requirement for particulars of the relationship in s
66EA(4)(b) was insufficient to satisfy the requirements
of procedural fairness
for a fair trial, in circumstances where s 66EA(4)(a) deprived an accused
from an entitlement to particulars
of any alleged unlawful sexual act that would
have been necessary if the act were charged as a separate offence.
argued, accordingly, that s 66EA is invalid in light of Chapter III of the
Constitution
(1) it deprives the court responsible for the trial of an accused for an offence
under that section, of the ability to provide procedural
fairness (by way of the
provision of particulars); and
(2) it authorises a jury to return a verdict in circumstances where there may be
no unanimity as to the unlawful sexual acts underpinning
the alleged
relationship.
is evident from the summary above, this argument was rejected in
Court of Appeal held that the section did not preclude the court from directing
that sufficient particulars of the offence be
provided so that an accused person
is in a position to answer the case against him at trial. It also held
that the equivalent of
s 66EA requires jury unanimity upon the essential
allegation that the defendant maintained a sexual relationship with a child that
involved more than one unlawful sexual act. As referred to above, an application
for special leave was refused in
the applicant appeared to accept the authority of
, he submitted that
several legislative amendments had been made since
which undermined
the right of an accused charged with an offence against s 66EA to a fair trial.
The applicant confirmed that he
did not separately challenge the
constitutionality of any of these provisions and that his constitutional
challenge was limited to
s 66EA itself.
applicant relied on the following:

of propensity or similar fact

applicant relied on what Fraser JA said in
at [42] (set out above) in
support of his submission that a trial of an accused for an offence against
s 66EA was, in light of these
amendments, “repugnant to the judicial
process in a fundamental degree”. He submitted that
and (5) (which
creates a rebuttable presumption) “reversed the onus of proof”. He
submitted that s 97A “lets the
prosecution generate tendency evidence out
of distorted memories, misinterpreted innocent behaviour, exaggerations and pure
fantasies”.
He argued that
“explicitly prohibits judges from
trying to prevent unsafe convictions based on uncorroborated
applicant also relied on provisions which were in force and principles which
were applicable when
was decided in support of a submission that his
right to a fair trial had been rendered illusory. He submitted that:
Evidence Act
(which permits evidence of complaint to be
given and provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to such evidence)
a manufacture of unlimited numbers of complaint witnesses out of
[the] complainant’s friends”;
Evidence Act
(which provides that it is not necessary
that evidence on which a party relies be corroborated and that it is not
necessary that
the judge warn the jury that it is dangerous to act on
uncorroborated evidence or give a direction relating to the absence of
corroboration);
(3) although the prosecution was not entitled to pose the question, “why
would the complainant lie” (
Palmer v The Queen
(1998) 193 CLR 1
[1998] HCA 2)
, the question nonetheless “hangs in” the air, and
unless the defence answers it, it is very damaging”;
(4) a direction in accordance with
[1985] HCA 66
was “eas[y] to dispense with” as juries do
not have to give reasons and could convict an accused whom they do not believe;
(5) his trial became unfair because the jury did not need to be satisfied of the
same unlawful sexual acts. He relied on
KBT v The Queen
(1997) 191 CLR
[1997] HCA 54
), in which an appeal against conviction was
allowed where the offence provision, s 299B of the Criminal Code
required the prosecution to prove particular offences of a sexual nature
during the period of the proscribed relationship between
the accused and a
child. As the trial judge had not directed the jury that they must be unanimous
as to the same three or more acts
constituting offences of a sexual nature, the
conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered.
Consideration
legislature has sought to criminalise sexual abuse of children in a way which
replaces offences which charge an accused with crimes
which comprise particular
physical acts at a nominated place and a nominated time with an offence such as
under s 66EA which provides
for different criterion of liability – being a
proscribed relationship. These legislative changes reflect a concern that the
traditional mode of charging an offence which comprises a particular act is not
particularly apposite to sex offending against children
whose recollections tend
to be untethered to particular dates or times. Further the nature of such
conduct, particularly when it
takes place within the ambit of a relationship
(such as in the present case between father and daughter) is that several
acts take place over an extended period which may make it difficult for
the complainant to distinguish one from another. These matters
particularly difficult for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that
a particular unlawful act against a child
was committed on a particular

cumulatively, be regarded as worsening the accused’s position

Evidence Act
was intended to
make significant changes to the laws of evidence in New South Wales:

. These changes included that the
requirement for corroboration be abolished
It was recognised by the
legislature that common law principles were not necessarily conducive to a just
result. For example,
Longman v The Queen
(1989) 168 CLR 79
[1989] HCA 60
) held that trial judges were required, where evidence of a
complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of time (in
case, more than 20 years), to direct juries that it was “dangerous to
convict” on that evidence alone, unless they
were satisfied of its truth
and accuracy, on the basis of presumptive prejudice arising from the delay (at
91, Brennan, Dawson and
Toohey JJ).
circumstances, where it is commonplace for a victim of sexual abuse not to
complain for decades, a
warning had the consequence that many sex
offenders were not convicted. Parliament enacted
Evidence Act
with the effect that
prejudice was relevant but
presumptive
prejudice was not: see the discussion in
[2024] NSWCCA 98
(Adamson JA).
R v Johnston
(1998) 45 NSWLR 362
at 367, Spigelman CJ said of prior
authorities which had placed emphasis on the lateness of complaint in an
assessment of the complainant’s
credibility:
There is no doubt that the criminal courts do have a body of experience that is
not shared by the ordinary juror. For many years
it was thought that practice
with respect to warnings about complainants in sexual assault cases reflected
such superior experience.
It is now clear that the practice in fact reflected
the limitations on the experience of judges, who were almost invariably male.
... it was established that as a general rule a court should direct a jury that
a complainant’s failure to complain at the
earliest reasonable opportunity
was something they could take into account in determining whether to believe
Kilby v The Queen
[1973] HCA 30
(1973) 129 CLR 460
at 465. ...
It appears to me that a Kilby direction was originally based on the assumption
that in the normal course of events, a victim of a
sexual assault will complain
at the first opportunity. Section 405B [now
Criminal Procedure
(NSW)] requires an express direction that that assumption is wrong.

needed only to prove two unlawful acts but an offender
could be punished for
more than two acts if the evidence established a greater number of unlawful

offender for offences (unlawful acts) of which he had neither been charged nor

Kingswell v The

) in support of the
proposition that it was unconstitutional to subject him to a penalty for
unlawful acts of which he had not been
convicted and that, because that was the
effect of s 66EA, the offence was unconstitutional. He also sought to gain
support from
the observations made by this Court in
for his submission
that it was not open to the legislature to shift the decision-making from jury
to judge and that this “shift”
undermined trial by jury, since the
jury would be responsible only for the question whether the proscribed
relationship had been
established and not for a determination of which of the
unlawful sexual acts had been made out.
the applicant accepted that he had no right to trial by jury as he was charged
with a State offence rather than a Federal offence,
he submitted that, as he
was, in fact, tried by jury, he was entitled to a trial by jury and not
“an imitation of a trial by
jury”. He submitted that this aspect of
s 66EA violated the

s 66EA between the offence of maintaining a proscribed relationship and the
penalty for the unlawful sexual acts engaged in by the accused during
the period of the relationship.

conspire with another to import narcotic goods, and provided that a

the plurality held that there was only one offence, although it carried a
different penalty, depending whether the aggravating
circumstance could be
established on sentence, their Honours nonetheless held (at 280) that the rule
of practice established in

that an aggravating
circumstance on sentence, though not an element of the offence, ought be
particularised in the indictment.
J said at 284 of judicial fact-finding on sentence:
The determination of facts relevant to the sentencing of an offender is a
routine function of judges in the administration of criminal
justice. The
determination of the aggravating circumstances in s. 235(2)(c)(ii), relating as
they do to the existence and gravity
of prior convictions, is no different in
kind from the determination of the class of matters commonly dealt with by trial
exercising a sentencing discretion. There is no reason why the jury
rather than the trial judge should determine these issues, and
convenience indicates that it is the judge who should undertake the function.

the observations in

reservations expressed by the Court about the effects of the provision. As
Dhanji J explained in
, referring to
Cheung v The Queen
[2001] HCA 67
), determining the facts on the basis of
which an offender is to be sentenced is a “commonplace occurrence”.
The sentencing
judge is to determine the facts to the standards of proof
outlined in
The Queen v Olbrich
(1999) 199 CLR 270
[1999] HCA 54
): beyond reasonable doubt for facts adverse to the offender and
on the balance of probabilities for facts in the offender’s
favour. These
facts must be consistent with the jury’s verdict but need not be facts
which the jury has considered at all,
since they may not be elements of the
offence. Nor is it the sentencing judge’s obligation to work out the basis
of the jury’s
verdict; it is to find the relevant facts consistently with
the jury’s verdict: see the discussion of the authorities in
[2022] NSWCCA 203

concerned a very different offence. In
, the appellant appealed
against his conviction for the offence of persistent sexual exploitation under
s 50 of the
, which required proof of two acts of sexual
exploitation separated by three or more days. The jury was given an extended
direction: that is, the jury was directed that they must be agreed on
which acts constituted the two acts of sexual exploitation
separated by three or
more days. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The appellant was sentenced on
the basis of the trial judge’s
finding that each of the acts
particularised had occurred. The High Court (Kiefel CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle
JJ) held at [53] (the
plurality) and [71] (Bell J) that the trial judge should
have asked the jury to specify which of the particularised acts of sexual
exploitation they were agreed had been proved and, as the judge had not done so,
the appellant was entitled to be sentenced on the
basis most favourable to him
(namely, that he had committed the two least serious acts particularised).
66EA was designed to overcome
by creating an offence, the gravamen
of which was the maintenance of the proscribed relationship, rather than
unlawful acts (although
at least two needed to be proved within the parameters
of the relationship) and providing that it was not necessary for the jury

trial by jury by provisions which permitted expert evidence to be given to
remove common
misconceptions held by members of the community about reactions of
a victim of sexual abuse
applicant argued that a provision such as
Evidence Act
compromised the fairness of the trial because the expert evidence which
became admissible as a consequence of that provision was designed
to undo common
misconceptions. He submitted that his right to trial by jury included a right to
be tried by an, in effect, unreconstructed

“educated” by evidence such as Dr Pulman’s, its members were
no longer capable
of reflecting the views of the community from which they were
drawn. The applicant submitted that it is critical that juries be able

reject this submission. While one of the acknowledged strengths of the jury
system is that twelve members of the community bring
to bear their collective
wisdom in determining whether the prosecution has proved the accused guilty
beyond reasonable doubt, the
law (whether common law or statutory) requires
certain warnings to be given in circumstances where there is a danger that the
may, uninstructed by a warning, apply false reasoning. Johnson J in

because there is a danger that

certain evidence:

The prosecution case at trial
prosecution case was that the applicant had groomed the complainant from a young
age and that, from the time she was 14 until
she was 16, he maintained an
unlawful sexual relationship with her which involved sexual acts, including
engaging in penile-vaginal
sexual intercourse with her on an almost weekly
The defence case
defence case was that the applicant had never touched the complainant sexually.
His case included that she had a motive to lie
because she could not cope on her
own without his support and therefore she fabricated evidence against him and
actively recruited
her friends to make notes and statements to the police which
recorded her complaints to them about the applicant’s conduct
towards her.
He also submitted that the complainant’s evident success at school, in
debating and at university was inconsistent
with her being the victim of

consideration of many of the remaining grounds of appeal and, in particular, the
unreasonable verdict ground (ground 6), requires
an appreciation of the evidence
adduced at the trial. The evidence is summarised below.
prosecution also adduced evidence for a tendency purpose to show that the
applicant had a long and enduring sexual interest in
the complainant. It relied
on various matters including the applicant taking the complainant for nudist
swimming from the age of
five and taking sexualised photographs of her,
including in 2005 when she was 12 and the family still lived in Melbourne (when
asked him to take a headshot of her, he took a whole body image, although
she was wearing a long T-shirt and no pants at the time).
The complainant also
gave evidence of the applicant taking a photograph of her in Melbourne when she
was naked and asleep. When she
asked him to delete it, he told her that he had
encrypted it and protected it by a password which he had forgotten and was
to delete it.
Evidence adduced in the prosecution
The complainant’s evidence
complainant was born in Russia in May 1992. She is an only child. In 1994, she
migrated with her father (the applicant) and her
mother (JK) to Australia. The
only family the complainant had in Australia were her parents and her uncle (the
applicant’s
younger brother).
applicant’s unusual parenting techniques were relied on by the prosecution
as context evidence. This evidence comprised
evidence of the applicant, JK and
the complainant attending nudist swimming pools; and the applicant touching the
complainant on
the bottom and, when she protested, stating he was allowed to
because he had “made it”. This evidence pre-dated the offending
period and related to the time when the family lived in Melbourne.
complainant gave evidence (which was relied on as context, not tendency) as to
the applicant’s conduct when she was swimming
laps in the pool,
... my father would be there in the same lane as me while I was swimming.
He’d, like, often swim just behind me or if he was
like waiting at and end
he’d, like, duck down below the water as I was approaching the end
And while I was like, turning around.
He was often in a spot where he could see me, like, relatively up close
underwater.
(Emphasis added to highlight the passage relied on by the applicant in ground
prosecution also relied on the following evidence of the applicant’s
conduct, which occurred prior to the commencement of
the alleged offending
conduct, for the purpose of context and tendency:
(1) the applicant massaging his wife, JK, in the lounge room of the house, which
would be heated by a gas heater for that purpose,
while they were either naked
or in underwear (if the applicant was the one giving the massage he would be in
underwear), in the presence
of the complainant who was also pressured by the
applicant to be naked or wearing only her underwear;
(2) the applicant making sexualised comments to the complainant and asking her
whether she felt “warm and fuzzy down there”
when a sex scene
appeared on TV during the massages;
(3) the applicant playing with and parting the applicant’s developing
pubic hair and comparing it to the fur of a “baby
giraffe” (in
(4) the applicant stroking the complainant’s back, which he sought to
justify on the basis he was checking if she was wearing
a bra, of which he
disapproved; and
(5) the applicant photographing the complainant when she was sparsely clad with
a particular focus on her chest and groin area.
prosecution relied on the following conduct for both context and tendency
purposes which is alleged to have occurred during or
after the offending
(1) the applicant showing the complainant pornography;
(2) the applicant continuing the pattern of sexual abuse, including
penile-vaginal sexual intercourse, with the complainant on a
regular Saturday
evening basis from the complainant’s 16th birthday until she was aged
between 21 and 23 years old in a locked
bedroom in the house; and
(3) the applicant massaging the complainant naked, generally after the
conclusion of sexual intercourse but continuing after the
sexual intercourse
ceased right up until the complainant moved out of the family home in 2016 (when
she was aged 23 or 24).
to the complainant, the offending itself started in early 2007 after the family
had moved from Melbourne to Sydney. The
complainant was aged 14 at the time of
the move and turned 15 in May of that year. At around the time they moved to
Sydney, JK suffered
from a fatigue condition, tired easily and spent most of her
time when at home in a separate bedroom. JK did not engage with the
complainant
much and was not close to her while the complainant was growing up.
applicant initiated the sexual offending by asking the complainant if she was
curious and wanted to try new things. He persuaded
her to let him kiss her. The
kiss involved the applicant putting his tongue in her mouth. Within a month or
two, the applicant was
not only sexually touching the complainant, including
under her clothing but he was also penetrating her vagina with his finger and
with his penis. The applicant would stimulate the complainant until she achieved
climax. The sexual activity was followed by the
applicant giving the complainant
a massage while they were both naked. The sexual abuse took place almost every
Saturday evening
from 5.30pm, except when either the applicant or the
complainant was away from home. Even when the complainant had her period, the
penile-vaginal intercourse would continue but on those occasions, the applicant
would put towels on the bed.
applicant wore a condom during penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with the
complainant. The complainant recalled an occasion on
which the condom either
split or slipped off. Subsequently, the applicant squirted liquid into the
complainant’s vagina as
well as making her take medication (inferentially,
a ‘morning after pill’ to prevent her becoming pregnant).
complainant put up with the conduct, as, if she did not, the applicant would
ignore her, “ice her out” and manipulate
her emotionally. The
complainant was asked to explain what she meant by being “ice[d]
out” in the following exchange,
which will be reproduced in full because
of its relevance to the grounds of appeal (including ground 2):
Q. You just said something earlier that I want you to clarify - you said that
you would have stood up to him or stood your ground,
he then would have iced you
out and then you would have ended up giving in. Can you just, as best you can,
unpack what you mean by
that? What was it about the icing out or the frosting
out or whatever, that made you give in?
A. Okay. So, I wanted to have a relationship with my parents, and when my father
was ignoring me or icing me out, like, that obviously
- that was, like, not just
neutral, that was, like, really hurtful because, like, I guess my understanding
is that normally, like,
parents love their children. I didn’t, like
– I knew my mother spent, like, a lot of time in her room and so I
really get the sort of, like, parental attention or affection from
her, and, like, I also knew she’d taken his side, so she
safe parent for me, either. And, like, I said before, the friends that I made in
Sydney were quite new friends. I
had friends in Melbourne who were older friends
but, like, we didn’t even have video calls back then, so they felt a lot
And so when my father ignored me or iced me out, it felt, like, I was throwing
away what was supposed to be one of the most meaningful
relationships in my life
and that hurt a lot.
And so the reason I’d given in was that the, like,
hour and a half that the abuse and the massages took every week just seemed,
like, a small price to pay for the rest of the week him being, like, engaged
and, like - in completely normal senses of the word
- like, loving and
affectionate and just, like, a good dad
(Emphasis added.)
complainant recalled the first occasion on which the applicant showed her
pornography. She said that it happened at an address
to which the family moved
in November 2007, when the complainant was 15 years old. She gave the following
... it started one day after he’d been, or like, one evening, after
we’d been naked in his bed, and he was touching me
and telling me an
erotic story. And, like, I assumed he introduced the pornography as another way
to, like, help me get aroused.
So, like, we moved to the computer the way
– the way that it would, like, work was, he’d, like, turn on the
monitor and
then, like, go through his files. So, it was, like, not on a
website, it was, like, files that he downloaded. He - and then he’d,
click on one of them, and then, like, the sound was muted, and, like, he would
sit on his wheelie chair facing the computer
and I would sit, kind of, like,
also facing the computer straddling one of his legs. And he would have one hand
on the keyboard,
like, fast forwarding through, like, the boring bits and his
other hand was, like, wrapped around my body, touching my clitoris,
of the regularity and consistency of the sexual abuse, the complainant was
unable to recall individual occasions (except where
something unusual occurred,
such as the splitting of the condom). However, the complainant said that she
recalled a single occasion
when the applicant had performed cunnilingus on her,
which had caused her pain. She also remembered an occasion when the applicant
engaged in “role play”, which she found disturbing.
applicant asked the complainant to read a book called the
Hite Report
was a finding that a lot of women have trouble having
an orgasm from
penile-vaginal intercourse, which she discussed with him. She thought that she
was younger than 16 or 18 at the time.
She remembered thinking at the time that
she was too young to be reading it.
long after the first act of penile-vaginal intercourse, the complainant
protested and refused to continue with the sexual activity.
An argument ensued
in the presence of JK. The complainant recalled that when she ultimately
relented, her mother said words to the
following effect, “[l]ook how happy
you’ve made him”.
complainant’s evidence was that the penile-vaginal sexual intercourse
continued on the regular Saturday night basis until
some point between mid-2013
and 2015 when she left for university. Although the penile-vaginal sexual
intercourse ceased, the naked
massaging continued until she moved out of the
family home.
2016, the complainant moved to Adelaide for work. This gave her the distance to
begin to disclose what she had experienced. In
2017 and 2018, she saw a
psychologist for treatment and also disclosed what had happened to friends, a
then boyfriend (referred to
compendiously as complaint witnesses) and JK. In
2018, she reported the matter to the police.
complainant was the principal witness for the Crown. As referred to above, her
evidence was corroborated in important respects
by JK, who said that she knew
that sexual intercourse was occurring between the applicant and the complainant;
that she was present
when the complainant confronted the applicant about it; and
that she also confronted the applicant about it herself in the presence
complainant.
complainant was cross-examined about tension with the applicant when she was
over 18 and was, in his view, spending too much time
away from home. She agreed
that she had created a document which set out her desire to go out as often as
she wished and accepted
that, “in this context”, she was able to
stand up for herself against her parents. The document was tendered on behalf
the applicant and marked Exhibit 11.
counsel put to the complainant that in about 2018 she had deliberately made
disclosures of what she alleged the applicant
had done to her with a view to
recruiting them as her supporters in her decision to report the
applicant’s conduct to the police
with the intention that he would be
charged. She agreed that she had made disclosures to some of her friends (who
were called as
complaint witnesses) so that they could provide an account to the
police about what she had told them.
complainant agreed in cross-examination that it was “on purpose”
that the applicant did not know that she had contacted
police until he was
actually charged. She agreed that she had kept him in the dark as to what was
happening, including telling him
that she was overseas when she was not, and
ringing him in 2019 and engaging in friendly conversations on the same day when
at the police station providing supplementary statements. The
complainant explained her conduct by saying she “felt was the
safest thing
for [her] to do” as she was continuing to pretend everything was
JK’s evidence
evidence was given by audio-visual link (AVL) as she was unvaccinated against,
and unwilling to be tested for, the COVID-19
virus and was, therefore, not
permitted to enter the court complex. Defence counsel agreed that it was
necessary for her evidence
to be given by different means.
the commencement of JK’s evidence, the trial judge informed the jury that
JK was going to give evidence by AVL and directed
them that they must not attach
more or less weight to the evidence just because the evidence was given in that
way and ought not
draw any adverse conclusion against the applicant because of
the means by which JK’s evidence was given.
JK’s evidence was given on the basis that she would not be charged for
failing to report the applicant’s conduct,
the jury was given a warning
pursuant to
s 165(1)(d)
Evidence Act
that her evidence may be
unreliable on the basis that she might reasonably be supposed to have been
criminally concerned in the events
giving rise to the proceedings.
evidence corroborated the complainant’s evidence in significant respects.
According to JK, while they were still
living in Melbourne, the applicant had
asked her if he could provide “sexual education” to the complainant
to which she
responded, “yes”.
gave evidence that around 2008, she had a conversation with the applicant about
sexual relations that he was having with the complainant.
She knew at that time
that the applicant was having sexual relations with the complainant and had
known that for about a year. She
asked the applicant, “[w]hy do you need
to continue having sex with [the complainant]”? His reply was that he
to do it otherwise the complainant would seek sexual adventures.
recalled that at some time between 2008 and 2010 she asked the applicant if they
could meet but he responded that he had an appointment
with the complainant at
that time. He said it was an “educating appointment” and it was 5pm
either on Saturday or Sunday.
JK understood that those appointments were for
sexual intercourse.
said that, although she could hear voices in the applicant’s bedroom, she
could not make out the words of any conversations
between the applicant and
complainant which took place there. JK also gave evidence that she saw the
complainant coming out of the
applicant’s bedroom not fully dressed,
carrying some of her clothes and not making eye contact.
and the applicant separated in 2013; she moved out of the family home in 2014
(leaving the complainant living with the applicant);
and they divorced in 2016.
The prosecution tendered an email from JK to the applicant dated 20 February
2013 (when the complainant
was 21 years old) in which JK wrote:
I can’t talk to you. I am finally allowing myself to feel what
been suppressing. l am furious.
l am going to the swimming pool.
Leave [the complainant] alone
(Emphasis added.)
her oral evidence, JK explained that the highlighted passage amounted to a plea
to the applicant to stop sexually abusing the complainant.
expert evidence of Dr Pulman
Pulman, a clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist and forensic psychologist,
was an expert in the dynamics of child sexual abuse
and counter-intuitive
responses. She gave evidence that it was common for children who are victims of
sexual assault to delay reporting
the assault. Her evidence was ruled admissible
Evidence Act
in a pre-trial ruling given by Hunt
explained that there may be various reasons for the delay:
... Children will say they are quite fearful of what might happen if they do say
something. They’re fearful that they won’t
be believed, that it may
cause the family to break down and [the] majority of children, in the children
that have been abused, don’t
like to see their family disrupted,
they’re really worried about what might happen. Often they feel ashamed,
they might feel
in some way responsible, it’s my fault, maybe I did
something wrong. And it’s very embarrassing for a child or an adolescent
or anyone to tell a person that they’ve been abused. So there’s a
whole series of different reasons which can be more
important to one child
versus another. But they’re essentially quite frightened to tell
[Where the perpetrator is a parent] in cases where a child or complainant lives
with the perpetrator ... that makes them even more
fearful. I mean,
they’re in the house. What’s going to happen? Maybe I’m going
to get hurt, maybe I’m going
to get punished in some way, maybe someone is
going to get angry. So, living in the presence of the perpetrator is one of the
for them to disclose.
Pulman also explained that where a child has been “groomed” by the
perpetrator, the child might ask themselves why
they did not say something
before the actual abuse started. She said of children who are abused by a family
... many children feel that, look, I still really love my dad. I just want the
abuse to stop, and so they might still appear to be
around the father, be very
affectionate with the father, do certain activities or sporting things. And so
that’s not unusual
for a child to appear to the general world as being
happy normal - sort of normal father-daughter relationship. So that’s not
unusual, and it can be over a period of time.
Pulman was asked about a situation where there is continued contact between the
perpetrator and the complainant:
So despite the child feeling uncomfortable, confused, uncertain, it may be that
they’re in a situation where they’re
living in a family,
there’s nowhere for the child to escape, and they might feel well, they
even go through a process of denial
themselves to kind of protect themselves
emotionally because other aspects of the family life can appear quite normal.
And they don’t
want to bring it up, and so you get that uncertainty, that
confusion in their emotion until they’re older and they can no longer
of tolerate that level of inner conflict or confusion that they may make the
decision then to say something.
Pulman also addressed the position of a child who is being sexually abused by
one parent and the other parent is complicit. She
... children or adolescents will say having an unsupportive parent is one of the
significant barriers for them saying anything. If
they’re in a household
where they’re being allegedly ... abused by one member and the other
member seems to be, for want
of a better word, complicit in that by not
protecting me, then the child ... feels that they’ve got nowhere to go.
go to the school or they might go to somewhere else to disclose, but
if you feel both of your parents are against you, it can be
a terrible burden
for a child or adolescent to carry.
asked about a situation where the mother is a “passive bystander [who]
knows that the abuse is occurring”, Dr Pulman
A child may feel that it’s their responsibility to keep both parents
happy. That somehow it’s expected of you just to
go along with this. If
you’ve got – if you yourself think this isn’t right, but
you’ve got parents telling
you otherwise or - it’s very, very
difficult for the child to say anything.
Pulman also addressed the difficulty of recalling details about a recurring
event. She said:
I think that we can all relate to events which are repeated, whether it’s
an incident of abuse ... or what it is - that if
... something’s happening
to you twice a week over weeks and months, you’re not [necessarily] going
to be able to remember
what happened on the second incident in the second week
of that third month. So it happens as frequently as that, but you won’t
able to - if somebody says, “Well, what happened to you on that Thursday?
What was different about that event to the previous
event,” you might not
be able to remember that detail in your mind, but you know that this was
something that used to happen
once or twice a week over a period of time.
Pulman was cross-examined about her report dated 27 May 2021, which was served
as part of the prosecution brief (but which was
not tendered at the trial).
After Dr Pulman gave evidence, and following consultation with the legal
representatives, the trial judge
directed the jury as to the use that could be
made of her evidence and said, in part:
Ladies and gentlemen, please understand carefully that Dr Pulman in no way
commented on what the complainant or the accused in this
trial did or did not
do. Instead, her evidence is placed before you to give you, if you like, a tool,
education as to the range of
responses that can occur from a child or adolescent
if they have in fact suffered sexual abuse by a parent.
Dr Pulman’s evidence cannot in any way go to the likelihood whether or not
there was sexual abuse of the complainant in this
trial by the accused.
That’s not put before you in that way, and she can’t comment on
that. She’s not spoken to
the complainant or the accused. Her evidence,
instead, is as a more general education for you. What her evidence does, if you
it, is neutralise any misconceptions that you might have about how, for
example, you would think a child or adolescent would respond
if they had indeed
been sexually abused by a parent. Dr Pulman’s evidence is there to
counter, perhaps, an intuitive reaction
you might have to evidence about how a
complainant has responded to alleged sexual abuse by a parent.

The applicant’s evidence
applicant gave evidence in his defence. He said that JK commonly gave him
massages and that the complainant was often present.
As the room was heated, he
was naked while he was being massaged. He said that no pressure was put on the
complainant to undress
but that he would have found it strange if she had sat
there and not removed her clothes, because of the ambient heat. He did not
recall whether he asked her if a particular scene on television made her feel
“warm and fuzzy”. He denied touching the
complainant’s pubic
hair and could not think of any context in which a baby giraffe was referred
agreed that he disapproved of the complainant wearing a bra because he did not
think that she needed one.
applicant said that there was conflict between him and JK from about 2007
onwards, they separated in March 2013 and were divorced
applicant denied engaging in any conduct which might be regarded as
“grooming” the complainant but agreed that he
used to give her
massages when she was naked. The massages usually took place at about 5.30pm on
Saturdays. He said that the massages
stopped at the complainant’s request
in July 2013. He agreed that they happened in his bedroom. When cross-examined

For no reason. We didn’t think about it.
moved out in May 2014. The applicant rented out spare rooms in their home on
Airbnb but otherwise he and the complainant were the
only family members in the
house after JK’s departure.
October 2019, the complainant led the applicant to believe that she was in
Canada. He received communications from the complainant
at that time which were
“very, very friendly”. He had no idea that she had complained to the
police about his conduct.
applicant was cross-examined about observing the complainant, naked, in the
swimming pool in the following exchange:
Q. When she would be swimming in the swimming pool, that’s why you would -
you heard her give evidence -
you would dive under and you would look at
, when she was fully naked, under the swimming pool.
A. Again, this is what [the complainant] told her [sic]. I can say that from
time to time, I will look her - behind her, this is
because we - we were sharing
the lane. And [the complainant] and me swum at different speeds, so sometimes I
would - when she was
little, I was swimming faster, but after about 12, she was
a better swimmer than me, then she would overtake me.
(Emphasis added to indicate the part relied on by the applicant in ground 11A.)
cross-examined about the
Hite Report
, the applicant said:
When [the complainant] turned 16 I couldn’t have a talk about sex with
her. I wouldn’t be comfortable and she would not
have it. So I - and [JK]
wouldn’t - wouldn’t do it. So I gave her Hite Report, make sure that
she read it and we never
returned to sex again. That’s all.
prosecutor cross-examined the applicant about continuing to give the complainant
naked massages after the sexual intercourse had
stopped as follows:
Q. Even though the abuse stopped, you were still giving her naked massages
where occasionally you’d rub her vaginal area
or her breasts.
A. If I did this with [the complainant], I would get a kick in the face, and she
would get up and leave, and never come back. I didn’t
want this to happen,
so it’s impossible. No.
(Emphasis added to indicate the part relied on by the applicant in ground 11.)
it was put to the applicant in cross-examination that there was ample
opportunity for him to have sexual intercourse with the
complainant, he said
that it was “impossible ... [b]ecause she was [a] prude, she was
assertive, she would never allow this
result – [she would] fight”.
To demonstrate this proposition, he referred to two photos which he had taken,
appreciated had not been tendered in evidence: the first was taken when
she was 12 and the next was taken at, or before, a school
formal. His evidence
of these photographs is addressed with respect to ground 2.
applicant said that when he was told that the complainant had reported the
matter to police, he thought that the case would never
go to trial because there
were “so many loose ends”. He also relied on the complainant’s
apparent well-being and
success at school as evidence that the offences were a
fabrication. He said:
10 years of rape are enough to make a girl dead. But was [the complainant] dead
in school, no she was flourishing in school while
getting raped weekly. How [do]
you reconcile this?
applicant’s counsel tendered several documents to establish the
complainant’s success at school, her debating, her
travels, her engagement
with friends, her active social life and the affectionate terms of her written
communications with the applicant.
The applicant described the complainant as
“very active” in debating, both at school and university and
referred to her
being selected to go to Denmark as a debater.
was the applicant’s case that these matters were inconsistent with the
offending conduct. For example, the applicant tendered
an email dated 11
November 2010 which the complainant sent to her parents asking for their advice
form for a Macquarie Scholarship. In it she
wrote, in part:
I’m writing this email because I know you two like your information in
email form and because I need help.
There seem to be two writing submissions; one’s a ‘personal
statement’ and one’s a ‘resume’,
both up to 2 A4 pages.
Apparently in the personal statement, I’m to write about my academic merit
(I’m pretty sure I
know what to write about here) and about my
“Outstanding character; *Maturity; *Common sense; *Eagerness and
Capacity to
triumph over hardship
financial disadvantage, sole parent or carer responsibility, non-English
speaking or Indigenous background,
effects of trauma and/or abuse
long term medical
condition or disability or coming from a rural or
remote area)
I’ve got examples that demonstrate maturity, common sense (what are some
worthy examples of this?), eagerness and passion but
there seems to be a bit
of an emphasis on ‘capacity to triumph over hardship’, which
I’ve been fortunate enough
to never have had to do
. So, what should I
write for that point or do I sort of ignore it?
(Emphasis added.)
applicant’s counsel sought to tender several documents relating to the
complainant’s school achievements, including
school reports and letters of
reference from the school which were rejected by the trial judge as being
“too far removed”.
This is the subject of ground
Evidence of the applicant’s brother
applicant’s brother gave evidence of the applicant’s good character.

anything of that nature was occurring.
of Victoria Drazenovic
Drazenovic, a work colleague of the applicant, gave evidence she was shocked by
the allegations and that she had never seen any
untoward behaviour between the
applicant and the complainant. She knew that the applicant was fond of massages
and conducted family
massages but she did not know that he conducted them in the
nude or that he and the complainant were in a bedroom when the massages
taking place.
The closing addresses
The prosecutor’s closing address
prosecutor referred to the complainant’s evidence about the applicant
giving her the
Hite Report
, as follows (this is the subject of ground
[The complainant] is telling you about a conversation that she’s had with
the accused where he’s saying that he’s
teaching her for her own
good. And what does the complainant say that dovetails him with that, him
showing her the [Hite] report
which is a survey about a number of women and how
they’ve failed to achieve orgasm. The accused said, his version was that
was his form of giving sex education to the complainant. You would reject that.
You would reject that.
prosecutor referred to Dr Pulman’s evidence at various points in his
closing address, in connection with the complainant’s
evidence (this is
the subject of ground 4A). For example, he said:
That’s the point of the tendency evidence. The context evidence, the
evidence of what happened in Melbourne, which occurs before
1 January 2007, is
to show you there is this incremental breaking down of boundaries where
she’s been slowly groomed, where
she’s been made to feel that this
That’s why there’s no bursting out of the bedroom screaming
“Rape, rape”. It doesn’t work that way,
and that’s why
Dr Pulman’s evidence was very important. It was an educative tool to talk
to you about counterintuitive
behaviours. But that also feeds into the delay in
complaint, because you’re thinking, “Well, why didn’t she tell
a school counsellor? Why didn’t she tell her best friend at school or a
teacher?” But, again, her evidence is important
As Dr Pulman said, where the person, the alleged perpetrator, is the biological
father you would expect a lengthy delay in complaint.
Where they live in the
same house you would expect a delayed complaint. Where you have another parent,
i.e., the biological mother,
knowing about it and not doing anything about it,
even Dr Pulman said a particularly lengthy delayed complaint, almost - and, to
some extent, she would expect that some people would just simply would not
complain at all.
prosecutor returned to the subject of delay in complaint as follows:
Now, another thing is that you should bear in mind that a delay in complaining
does not necessarily indicate that it’s false
or fabricated; (a) you heard
from Dr Susan Pulman. She actually said to you that child sexual abuse, the one
thing that’s common
is that there is a delay in complaint. That’s
the one common thread in child sexual abuse.
Putting that to one side, she gave you evidence as to why she delayed in
complaining, and you saw the way in which she complained;
that it was piecemeal.
Now, there may be very good reasons why complainants delay in complaining; (a)
[the complainant] gave them
to you, and (b) Dr Pulman, in general terms, said
why that happens.
the conclusion of the Crown’s closing address, the prosecutor
Members of the jury, there was no persuasion by the complainant recruiting her
friends. There was no deception. You know, the idea
that she could stand up to
playing the piano is a qualitative - it’s like another universe to the
sexual abuse that she’d
been groomed for and primed for. Any
counterintuitive conduct that you think doesn’t make sense, Dr Pulman
explained that.
You would, members of the jury - it’s a matter for you,
but you’d reject the accused’s evidence.
The defence closing
the defence closing was not the subject of any ground of appeal (except in the
context of criticism of defence counsel which is
addressed below), it is not
necessary to summarise it. It accorded with the defence case summarised
The summing up
the course of the summing up, the jury sent a note asking for the transcript of
the evidence of witnesses. Her Honour gave the
following direction (which is
relevant to ground 9):
... I got your note asking for a copy of the transcript of the evidence of the
witnesses, and the transcript of my directions to
you. Ladies and gentlemen,
with respect to the evidence of the witnesses, three copies of that transcript
will be prepared for you.
That will of course also include the evidence of the
complainant as a witness, and the accused as a witness. Please bear in mind,
ladies and gentlemen, that someone has done his or her best to write or type the
transcript. Sometimes errors can arise in a transcript,
and if there is
something in the transcript that is inconsistent with what you heard here in the
courtroom, then it is what you heard
that is the evidence.
With respect to my directions of law, no transcript is made of that, at this
stage, and that is just typical for how we conduct trials,
so what it means is
this. If you would like me to better explain or repeat or elaborate upon any
direction of law I give to you,
please don’t hesitate to send me through a
trial judge said in part, of the Crown’s reliance on the
The Crown relies on all sexual acts and touching in sexual context that occurred
before and after the offence period as context and
tendency. Additionally, as
context and tendency, the Crown relies on the evidence concerning the accused
massaging the complainant
while she was naked. The Crown says that had a sexual
connotation.
It would involve, [the complainant] said, the accused brushing
breast area or
vaginal area
or buttocks. The Crown additionally
relies on the evidence concerning the accused showing [the complainant]
pornography during the
offence period and telling her erotic stories by way of
[the complainant] becoming aroused. The Crown additionally relies on the
evidence concerning the accused brushing [the complainant]’s back,
effectively checking if she was wearing a bra. The Crown
says those pieces of
evidence all can be used by you as both context and tendency.
The other items that I referred to can be used as tendency, so let me remind you
again what those other items are that the Crown
says are both context and
tendency. The naked massaging of the complainant with a sexual connotation,
including brushing intimate
areas of the complainant’s body.
The Crown’s submission to you is that you would accept [the
complainant’s] evidence that it had the sexual context of
the accused
brushing her intimate areas of the body, her breasts, her vaginal area and her
buttocks. [The complainant’s] evidence
is that the massage would also
regularly occur after an act of sexual intercourse.
(Emphasis added to indicate the parts which are the subject of ground 11B)
trial judge, when summarising the Crown case, said of the complainant’s
Hite Report
(this is the subject of ground 11D):
He would also tell her he was educating her, teaching her for own good, showing
the Hite Report, which is a survey about a number of women and how they
failed to achieve orgasm
. Mr Crown said this was his form of giving, he
claimed this was his form of giving sex education to the complainant, but Mr
said you would reject that. It is able to be inferred from that conduct
that the accused had a sexual interest in [the complainant].

Allegation that “new evidence prevents a
miscarriage of justice” (ground 2)
applicant sought to tender, on the appeal, evidence which he submitted defence
counsel ought to have tendered at the trial. I
understood this to form part of
his allegation that defence counsel was incompetent and that, on that basis, his
conviction ought
be overturned. Further, he also relied on evidence which was
not available at the time of the trial and sought to tender it in this
establish that there had been a miscarriage of justice.
The role of counsel
turning to the balance of the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to address the
role of defence counsel. The applicant has
responded to the Crown’s
submissions that he was bound by the way his trial was conducted by defence
counsel or that leave
under r 4.15 of the
Supreme Court (Criminal Appeal)
(NSW) (r 4.15) was required, that he ought not be bound by his
counsel’s conduct because his counsel was incompetent. The applicant
also made several criticisms of defence counsel for not asking questions which
he wanted asked or not tendering documents which
he wanted to be tendered or
which he contended ought be tendered. The detail of these complaints will be
addressed below. However,
it is useful to outline the applicable
principles.
starting point is that the applicant was entitled to appear for himself at the
trial (as he did in this Court) or be represented
by a legal representative. He
chose to be represented. The applicant was entitled to competent legal
representation, which required
his counsel to advance the defence case, to
challenge prosecution witnesses, to take appropriate objections and to tender
material in support of the defence case. The applicant’s defence
counsel was not “some kind of ‘mouthpiece’
[required to conduct] the case in close conformity with the client’s
directions”:
(1990) 19 NSWLR 677
691-692 (Gleeson CJ). These propositions are reflected in the Legal Profession
Uniform Conduct (Barristers) Rules 2015 (NSW)
(the Barristers Rules): see the
discussion in
Mashayekhi v R (No 2)
[2021] NSWCCA 161
P, Button and Wright JJ agreeing).
42 of the Barristers Rules provides that:
A barrister must not act as the mere mouthpiece of the client or of the
instructing solicitor and must exercise the forensic judgments
called for during
the case independently, after the appropriate consideration of the
client’s and the instructing solicitor’s
wishes where practicable.
61(a) of the Barristers Rules provides that:
A barrister must take care to ensure that decisions by the barrister to make
allegations or suggestions under privilege against any
(a) are reasonably justified by the material
then available to the barrister;
(b) are appropriate for the robust advancement of
the client’s case on its merits, and
(c) are not made principally in order to harass or
embarrass a person.
64 of the Barristers Rules provides that:
A barrister must not allege any matter of fact in:
(a) any court document settled by the barrister,
(b) any submission during any hearing,
(c) the course of an opening address, or
(d) the course of a closing address or submission on the
unless the barrister believes on reasonable grounds that the factual material
already available provides a proper basis to do so.
65 of the Barristers Rules provides that:
A barrister must not allege any matter of fact amounting to criminality, fraud
or other serious misconduct against any person unless
the barrister believes on
reasonable grounds that:
(a) available material by which the
allegation could be supported provides a proper basis for it, and
(b) the client wishes the allegation to
be made, after having been advised of the seriousness of the allegation and of
possible consequences for the client and the case if it is not made out.
67 provides:
A barrister must not make a suggestion in cross-examination on credit unless the
barrister believes on reasonable grounds that acceptance
of the suggestion would
diminish the credibility of the evidence of the witness.
relevant Barristers Rules will be referred to in connection with the specific
grounds of appeal to which they are germane.
, Gleeson CJ explained:
Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask,
what lines of argument to pursue and what points to
abandon, are all matters
within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of
judgment, including judgment
as to tactics.
similar effect, Simpson AJA (Bellew and Campbell JJ agreeing) said in
[2019] NSWCCA 186
Counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which the litigation is
conducted, the discretion extending to matters such as
the witnesses to be
called, the questions to be asked either in chief or in cross-examination, the
evidence to be adduced, and the
lines of argument to be pursued or abandoned.
The client is bound by the decisions made in the exercise of these discretions.
an accused will be bound by the conduct of his or her counsel at the trial.
However, where serious errors or omissions
deprive the accused of a fair trial
such as to cause a miscarriage of justice, an appeal against conviction will be
allowed and a
new trial ordered. In
, Gleeson CJ said
1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and
a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts
a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of
the way in which the system of criminal justice
2. As a general rule an accused person is
bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that
in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for
setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel
were made without, or
contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.
3. However, there may arise cases where
something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of
incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other
cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage
justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with
precision. When they arise they will attract
appellate intervention.

TKWJ v The Queen
(2002) 212 CLR 124
[2002] HCA 46
) at [79]-[80] and
Nudd v The Queen
(2006) 80 ALJR 614
, the High Court said at
The question whether there has been a miscarriage of justice is usually answered
by asking whether the act or omission in question
“deprived the accused of
a chance of acquittal that was fairly open”. The word “fairly”
should not be overlooked.
A decision to take or refrain from taking a particular
course which is explicable on the basis that it has or could have led to a
forensic advantage may well have the consequence that a chance of acquittal that
might otherwise have been open was not, in the circumstances,
fairly open.
One matter should be noted with respect to the question whether counsel’s
conduct is explicable on the basis that it resulted
or could have resulted in a
forensic advantage. That is an objective test. An appellate court does not
inquire whether the course
taken by counsel was, in fact, taken for the purpose
of obtaining a forensic advantage, but only whether it is capable of explanation
on that basis.
As already indicated, if there is a defect or irregularity in the trial, the
fact that counsel’s conduct is explicable on the
basis that it resulted or
could have resulted in a forensic advantage is not necessarily determinative of
the question whether there
has been a miscarriage of justice. It may be that, in
the circumstances, the forensic advantage is slight in comparison with the
importance to be attached to the defect or irregularity in question. If so, the
fact that counsel’s conduct is explicable on
the basis of forensic
advantage will not preclude a court from holding that, nevertheless, there was a
miscarriage of justice.

applicant had firm views about the way he wished the trial to be conducted as
were evident from the way in which he conducted
the appeal, including in his
several complaints (in ground 2) that certain evidence which was available was
not tendered as part
of the defence case. For the reasons which follow, I do not
discern any lack of competence in the way in which defence counsel conducted
defence case. The way in which his discretion, as counsel, was exercised fell
within the ambit reserved to him by the Barristers
Rules and did not give rise
to any matter which would call for this Court’s
intervention.

submitted ought to have been tendered by his counsel
at trial (identified by the
letter of its attachment to his affidavit of 17 January 2025) or which ought be
admitted by this Court
on the appeal.
The distinction between
“fresh evidence” and “new evidence”
evidence is fresh evidence, then it may be admitted on appeal if it is credible
or capable of belief and there is a significant
possibility that, if the
evidence had been adduced at trial, the jury, acting reasonably would have
acquitted the applicant. However,
if the evidence is only new evidence, it may
only be admitted on appeal if the new evidence is such that, taken with all the
at the trial, the conclusion ought be drawn that the prosecution had
not established the applicant’s guilt of the charge beyond
doubt. If the evidence does not meet the applicable threshold, the appropriate
course is for the Court to reject the tender:
Franklin v R
[2021] NSWCCA
(McCallum JA, Beech-Jones and Hamill JJ).
addressing the question whether the evidence is new or fresh and whether it
meets the threshold for tender, it is necessary
to address whether it would have
been admissible at the trial in any event since if it would not have been
admissible at the trial,
it ought be rejected without further consideration.
Postcards sent by the complainant to the applicant (attachment
B comprised postcards which the complainant sent to the applicant from
Copenhagen (in July-December 2014); Japan (January
2017); Iceland (July 2017);
Vietnam (January 2018) and Nelson, Canada (in 2019). In each, the complainant
expressed enthusiasm about
seeing the applicant. These documents are of marginal
relevance. The complainant lived with the applicant and was dependent on him
throughout the charge period and for several years beyond. Her evidence was that
she acquiesced in the conduct in order to keep the
peace between them and
because he would otherwise make life unbearable for her. It was objectively
reasonable for defence counsel
to decide not to tender these so as to avoid the
insinuation that any expression of affection for the applicant meant that the
complainant
was not being sexually abused by him.

meet the threshold for admission of new evidence
on appeal and ought be

applicant submitted that the highlighted portion of her note was “in
serious conflict with her victim impact statement”.
Whatever slight
disparities there may be between this document and the victim impact statement
(which was tendered at the sentence
hearing and therefore was not available to
defence counsel at the trial), it is difficult to conceive of any forensic
benefit which
the applicant could have gained from its tender. Indeed, there was
considerable forensic risk since the applicant’s reliance
on the note
might have caused the jury to regard him as harsh and pedantic.

prosecution brief. It does not meet the threshold for
admission on appeal and
ought therefore be rejected.
A screenshot of JK’s webpage
(attachment J)
applicant conducted a Google search of JK’s webpage on 23 January 2017 and
took a screenshot of a web page which purported
to offer health improvements on
a “DNA level view meditation” under a stroboscopic light. In support
of his submission
that this document would have made a difference at the trial,
he said at paragraph 5 of his affidavit of 17 January 2025:

the trigger of the divorce.
It is entirely possible that she used her

sufficient basis to cross-examine the complainant by reference
to any assisted
recovery of memory. Further, it would not meet the threshold in

to address it further, except to say that it is new evidence and not fresh
A video recording of the complainant’s
presentation of a demonstration debate of her student group (attachment
F is a video recording which the applicant said that he took and stored on a
family computer. It depicts an occasion when
the complainant was debating in
favour of public nudity (that being the set topic). She acknowledged to the
audience that her parents
were in the audience. She appeared confident and
articulate and caused the audience to laugh, appropriately, at the various
she was making.
applicant submitted:
The significance of this video is hard to overestimate: it is enough to see this
video once to realise that the complainant was not
having problems with her
parents at all, let alone serious problems. At least two friends of the
complainant gave evidence that she
avoided talking about her family with them,
implying that it was obvious that she had a problem at home. [SF, one of the
witnesses said]: “I noticed that she was quiet. I noticed she
had an unusual relationship with her family.”. [DM, another
witness] [m]ade a similar statement: “[The complainant] tended not to
speak much about parents.”. This video
shows that they were likely lying.
is difficult to understand what this evidence could have added to the undisputed
evidence at the trial that the complainant was
an accomplished debater, both at
school and university and was sent to Denmark to debate. The complainant’s
public acknowledgement
of her parents does not undermine her evidence of the
offending or how she presented to her friends to whom she ultimately divulged
the applicant’s conduct. Had defence counsel been aware of the video, he
could, objectively, have regarded it as of no forensic
benefit to the applicant
in the trial.

constitutes new evidence. At its highest, it tends to
prove that the complainant
had the opportunity to tell a doctor about the abuse, but did not do so. It was
not disputed that there
was a lengthy period before the complainant disclosed
the abuse. Had the complainant been cross-examined about her failure to complain
to the doctor to whom she had been sent, the trial judge would have been obliged
to direct the jury that absence of complaint or
delay in complaining does not
necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is
false; there may be good
reasons why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in
making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about the assault; and must
direct the jury that delay in complaining is relevant to the victim’s
credibility unless there is sufficient evidence to
justify such a direction:

analysis by the applicant of how the complainant

covered by the indictment
(1 January 2007-17 May 2008). The applicant said, in
The analysis results are shocking. She was spending at least 20% of her time
going out (except in 2012, when she spent 10% on this)

risk that the tribunal of
fact would consider the applicant to be controlling of the complainant. Further,
to suggest that the complainant
had fabricated her evidence of the abuse because
she was annoyed with her father for no longer supporting her financially would
be likely to produce an adverse reaction from the jury.
if relevant, the evidence is new and does not meet the threshold for admission
on appeal. Accordingly, it ought be rejected.
A photograph of the
complainant in a red T-shirt when she was 12 years old (attachment N)
photograph at Attachment N was referred to in the evidence given by the
complainant at the trial (but apparently not tendered).
The complainant gave
evidence that she asked the applicant to take a headshot of her when she was

So I asked for a headshot. At the time, I was wearing a long black red - sorry,
not black. Long red polo shirt.

photo. And then I
told him I was upset, because I wanted a headshot. But he took
a photo of all of me, including like, my mid to upper thigh, which
expect to be on camera.
(Emphasis added.)
this Court, the applicant submitted in respect of the photograph to which the
complainant referred (paragraph 11 of his affidavit
of 17 January
It was taken by me and stored on a family computer. This photo caused a major
drama, and she complained about it to the police 16
years later. This episode
was also mentioned at the trial [
]. This shows how extremely prude,
guarded, and anti-sexual this girl was (and still is, because she complained to
the police about
the photo in 2019, at the age of 27, and complained again at
the trial).
There is absolutely no possibility that she would engage in
incest without a major fight.
It also shows that there was no grooming, or,
if there was any, it was ineffective because her unreasonably prude views and
“boundaries”
have not changed much since she was 12. It undermines
the assertion of the Crown that the applicant was grooming the complainant,
gradually “breaking down boundaries”. The context evidence, the
evidence of what happened in Melbourne, which occurs
before 1 January 2007, is
to show you there is this incremental breaking down of boundaries where
she’s been slowly groomed,
where she’s been made feel that this is
normal. It supports my statement that the parents efforts were directed at
the child closer to the normality.”
(Emphasis added.)
applicant also referred to his own evidence about the complainant’s
modesty when he was cross-examined about the family’s
regular attendance
at a nudist swimming club after the complainant turned five. He said in the
following exchange in his cross-examination:
Q. But you all went to a nudist swimming club.
A. Yes. After she turned five, and insistent on - insisted on wearing shorts on
top of her bathing suits. This is not normal for
five-year-olds.
Q. Sorry, what do you mean, what’s normal for five-year-olds?
A. Some five-year-olds in 1997, when [the complainant] was five, they were lying
naked on the beach, and didn’t think about
this, and I didn’t want
her to think about it.
applicant also gave evidence about the photograph taken when the complainant was
12 and a later photograph taken of her at a school
formal (both of which were
the subject of evidence but neither was tendered), as follows:
[The complainant] is in white dress from top to bottom. Her - her dress touch
the floor and that photo that they’ve taken of
- of her in T-shirt, she
complained about this to police 12 years later and - and you are saying that
this girl would allow me liberties.
referred to above, the complainant gave evidence at the trial about the
photograph of her as a 12-year old (which was plainly available
at the trial and
therefore constitutes new evidence) and her reaction to it. It was not necessary
that the photograph be tendered
for this purpose. The submissions which the
applicant now seeks to make about the complainant’s reaction to the
would have had to be put to the complainant at the trial, which would
have carried a significant forensic risk. It was an objectively
forensic decision for defence counsel not to tender the photo taken of the
complainant, apparently against her wishes, in
somewhat revealing clothing as a
12-year old child since there was a substantial risk that its forensic effect
would be to confirm
the tendency alleged by the prosecution that the applicant
had a long-standing sexual interest in the complainant since she was at
it is difficult to understand how a photograph of the complainant in a
full-length dress for a school formal could have advanced
the applicant’s
case (it having been described in his evidence in any event). No miscarriage of
justice can be established
on this basis. In addition, the photograph does not
meet the threshold for the admission of new evidence on appeal and ought be
A fictional story written by the complainant at the age
of 10 (attachment P)
applicant sought to tender on appeal a fictional story written by the
complainant at the age of 10 (which was not referred to
in the trial but which
obviously pre-dates it) in support of a submission that the complainant is
capable of writing a fictional
story which is “not less believable than
her story of the abuse” (paragraph 13 of the applicant’s affidavit
17 January 2025). The story is an imaginative exercise in which the
complainant writes a diary from the point of view of a convict
girl who is in
prison in England in 1787 and is worried about being transported.
regard this evidence as irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible. Its absence
from the trial is therefore incapable of giving rise
to a risk of a miscarriage
of justice.
Documents establishing that the complainant was an
excellent student (attachments Q, R, S, T and V)
applicant sought to tender a reference from the complainant’s school in
Melbourne (attachment Q); a reference from her school
(attachment R); a certificate showing that she was awarded the Minister of
Education’s Award for Excellence in 2010
(attachment S); a list of her
marks at university (attachment T); and a photograph of herself and the
applicant at the awards ceremony
(attachment V). Apart from attachment V, each
of these documents was available at the trial and formed part of a bundle of
marked for identification, MFI 13.
documents came to be marked for identification in the trial as the complainant
was cross-examined about her discussion with
Detective Lavington, a police
officer in Adelaide, on 14 and 15 June 2018 (when the complainant was 26 years
old). The complainant
agreed that she gave Detective Lavington a paper bag
containing numerous personal documents and photographs. The complainant also
agreed that she had told Detective Lavington that she was going to destroy those
documents but the Detective accepted the documents
documents were, thus, available at the trial, and could have been tendered by
defence counsel had he considered it to be to the
applicant’s forensic
benefit. As referred to above, it was not in issue in the trial that the
complainant was an excellent
school student and received various awards and
completed her degrees at university. It was the applicant’s case at trial
this was inconsistent with the offending having occurred. The applicant
submitted in this Court (paragraph 17 of his affidavit of

apparent “logic” of the applicant’s submission, at trial and
in this Court – that someone who is suffering
from sexual abuse cannot
function well in other areas of life – was put to, and, implicitly,
rejected by, the jury. It was
objectively reasonable for defence counsel to
consider that it was not to his client’s forensic benefit to tender all
the documents
available that established a matter which was not in dispute. I am
not persuaded that the non-tender of these documents created any
miscarriage of justice to the applicant.
to attachment V, the fact that the complainant was prepared to be photographed
with the applicant at the awards ceremony is consistent
with her evidence that,
except when he was sexually abusing her, he was a loving and supportive father
(on whom she relied emotionally
and financially, as her mother was generally
unavailable to her).
of these attachments are new evidence which, even if admissible, do not meet the
threshold for admission on appeal and ought,
accordingly, be

relevance of this document is too marginal to warrant its admission. It
post-dates the charge period by about 12 years. Further,
as the complainant
explained in her evidence extracted above, when the applicant was not sexually
abusing her in their regular weekly
sessions on Saturday evenings, he was a
“loving and affectionate and ... good dad”. Thus, any material which
that he acted positively towards the complainant was not relevant to
any matter in issue.
any event, as new evidence, it does not meet the applicable threshold and ought
be rejected.
JK’s letter to “self” (attachment
applicant sought to tender a document which was annexed to a statement made by
JK which formed part of the brief which was served
on the applicant before the
trial (and is therefore new evidence). In the document, JK expressed
unconditional love to various parts
of her body. The applicant submitted that it
showed that JK was not capable of co-parenting the complainant. The document is
to any issue in the proceedings and is therefore
inadmissible.

the applicant over the years (attachment X)

Various academic
articles (attachments Y, Z, AA and AB)

convenience”: an article about nudism and children (attachment
academic study about disclosure by teenagers of sexual abuse (attachment Z); an
academic study claiming that 86% of allegations
of child sexual abuse in divorce
proceedings are false (attachment AA); and an academic article on the benefits
of massage for adults
and children (attachment AB). It is not clear whether the
applicant sought to tender them. If so, they should be rejected as inadmissible
as irrelevant or by reason of the opinion rule.
photographs taken by the applicant of people sleeping (attachment AC)
applicant sought to tender these photographs on the appeal to demonstrate
“that there was nothing unusual or sinister in
[him] ... taking photos of
sleeping people” (paragraph 27 of his affidavit of 17 January 2025).
the applicant took photographs of other people when they were sleeping is
irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. The tender of
these photographs ought to
be rejected.
relevance of the applicant taking a photograph of the complainant when she was
naked and asleep and living in Melbourne (just
before the commencement of the
charge period), as referred to above, was that it showed that he had a sexual
interest in the complainant
as a young girl. This evidence was capable of being
used by the jury for a tendency purpose to prove that it was more likely that
maintained a sexual relationship with the complainant when she was aged between
14 and 16, as alleged by the Crown.

training or had experience such as to qualify him to

(Beech-Jones CJ at CL, Harrison

(2022) 110 NSWLR 339
[2022] NSWCCA 136
Without more, the mere reading of various papers in a field of discipline by a
person with no relevant prior training, study or experience
either does not
amount to “study” for the purposes of
or is at least not sufficient study to satisfy
(accepting that the issue is one of degree). The significance of the
witness possessing such qualifications, be it training, study
or experience, is
that the courts expect that that expertise will be applied in undertaking a
critical review of the research material
and acquiring specialised knowledge
these reasons, the applicant’s “report” is inadmissible and
ought be rejected.

she left for Adelaide, the complainant was usually present on such
occasions. The deponent said that she never witnessed any “animosity,
tension or conflict” between the applicant and the complaint; she kept in
touch with the complainant after the complainant
moved to Adelaide. She deposed
that she did not believe that the applicant could be convicted “given the
facts [she] knew about
the family and the available evidence”. She also
deposed that, during the trial, she discussed the progress of the trial with
applicant “almost every day”. He made complaints to her about the
way in which defence counsel was running the trial.
Bayjanova was plainly available to give evidence at the trial and could have
given character evidence on behalf of the applicant,
had she been called. The
defence could have requested that she be called by the Crown to give evidence,
for what it was worth, about
her interaction with the family and the timing of
the visits. Her evidence is, thus, new, rather than fresh. It does not meet the
threshold for admission on appeal and ought therefore be

provides slightly more detail than was provided in his oral evidence. It falls
far short of the threshold for the admission of new evidence on appeal and ought
be rejected.
Attachment U

stated in the body of the affidavit, an email in which he refused a job in
Sydney because he thought
that it was in the best interests of the complainant
not to move at that time). The diary entry was made when the complainant was
years old and still living in Melbourne and concerns her lack of sex education.
It was tendered in the defence case and marked
Exhibit 3. Accordingly, it is
neither new nor fresh and was in evidence before the jury. An email such as the
one described by the
applicant in paragraph 32 of his affidavit would be new

The balance of the applicant’s appeal
turning to the individual grounds, it is important to note the ambit of the
applicant’s appeal. He challenged the conduct
of defence counsel, the
prosecutor and the trial judge. The applicant submitted that there were
substantial irregularities and errors
in his trial, including: alleged failures
to challenge evidence adduced by the Crown; “inadmissible prejudicial
evidence, misstatements
of facts, inflammatory comments, violations of the rules
of cross-examination”; and “[c]oncealed or rejected admissible
favourable evidence”. He submitted that the trial was “not fair by
any standard” and was an “unopposed and
an unlawful assassination of
character”.
submitted that, in a case such as the present where the credibility of the
complainant was an important issue, these irregularities
and errors were of
particular significance. He relied on the following passage from
[2001] HCA 65
(2001) 75 ALJR 1708
In cases where credibility is in issue and where the jury’s assessment of
the truthfulness of a vital prosecution witness might
be important for their
verdict, the admission of inadmissible evidence, the rejection of admissible
evidence or the unavailability
of significant and relevant evidence that later
comes to light may, in a particular case, occasion such a miscarriage of justice
that a guilty verdict should not stand.

It may readily be accepted that the trial jury did accept the evidence given
against the appellant and rejected his contrary evidence.
But for the
reasons given earlier, the possibility that the jury took account of the wrongly
admitted evidence in deciding what
evidence to accept or reject cannot be
excluded. If the wrongly admitted evidence
account in reaching a conclusion about what other evidence to accept, the
conclusion actually reached by the trial jury
would not provide a sound basis
for reaching a conclusion about whether guilt had been proved beyond reasonable
doubt. It is wrong
to begin an examination of whether a substantial
miscarriage of justice has actually occurred by accepting, as necessarily
the preference by the jury for some controverted evidence when that
preference may have been affected by the error that was made
applicant accepted that, in order to obtain relief if any error or irregularity
was made out, it was necessary for him to show
that there had been a miscarriage

that it could realistically have affected the reasoning of
the jury to its verdict:

factual basis for Dr Pulman’s opinion, given
that much of the material
would not be in a form where it could go to the jury. However, but for this
matter, defence counsel did
not submit that opinion evidence about the conduct
of complainants of child sexual abuse, including delayed complaint, was not, of
itself, admissible pursuant to
Evidence Act
reasons given at the conclusion of the hearing, Hunt DCJ
It is important to appreciate for purposes of this ruling that Dr Pulman does
not seek to opine as to the legitimacy or otherwise
of the complainant’s
account. Rather, what she does is undertake a literature review, but as I
understand it, governed by her
experience as a forensic psychologist working in
similar areas.
DCJ adjourned the trial (from 31 May 2021 to February 2022) to remedy any
unfairness caused to the applicant by the late service
of Dr Pulman’s
report. His Honour also ruled inadmissible aspects of her evidence. Further, the
Crown confirmed that it did
not press the tender of any of the material relating
to the applicant’s trial (such as the transcript of the
complainant’s
evidence or her witness statements) which had been provided
to Dr Pulman.
4E has not been made out.
Ground 3: alleged inadmissibility of Dr
Pulman’s report
of the oral evidence given by Dr Pulman concerned the possible responses of
victims of child sexual assault and was within her
accepted area of expertise.
None of it related to the details of the present case or to the
complainant’s conduct, except in
so far as her general evidence could be
applied by the jury to the complainant’s conduct. Dr Pulman’s
evidence was relevant
to the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s
credibility and in particular to counter the defence case that the complainant
had fabricated her evidence and decided, years later (hence the delay in
complaint), to punish the applicant for no longer supporting
her financially.
Neither the opinion rule (evidence of opinion is not admissible to prove the
existence of a fact about the existence
of which the opinion was expressed:
Evidence Act
), nor the credibility rule (credibility
evidence about a witness is not admissible:
Evidence Act
prevented its admission, having regard to the exception in
Evidence Act
provides that the opinion rule and the credibility rule do not apply to
evidence of a person’s opinion that is “wholly
or substantially
based” on specialised knowledge based on their “training, study or
experience” if the evidence
is capable of “substantially affect[ing]
the assessment of the credibility of a witness” and is the subject of
Each of these conditions was fulfilled in the present case: see the
consideration of this type of evidence in
at [36]-[44] (which was
decided after the applicant’s trial). For these reasons, ground 3 has
not been made out.
Alleged miscarriage of justice arising from
inadmissible evidence presented as “context” and
“tendency” evidence
the applicant made extensive reference to authorities which pre-dated
Evidence Act
(which came into operation on 1 July 2020) he accepted
that the section created a rebuttable presumption that particular tendency
evidence had significant probative value. However, he submitted that the trial
judge ought to have determined, pursuant to
, that it did not have
significant probative value because there were “sufficient grounds to do

tendency evidence ought to have led to its exclusion

. He sought to draw from
IMM v The Queen
[2016] HCA 14
) the proposition that evidence given by a
complainant which was unsupported by an independent source, could be regarded as
significant probative value.
applicant submitted that social mores had changed since the 1990’s and
conduct which would have been acceptable in 1990
(a father kissing a child on
the lips) would no longer be regarded as acceptable. I am not persuaded of the
relevance of this submission
given that the charge period in the present case
was from 1 January 2007 to 17 May 2008 and the evidence of grooming did not
back before 1997 (when the applicant took the complainant nude swimming)
and principally concerned the period from 2004 (when the
complainant was 12)
onwards. In any event, the applicant’s submission was not supported by
evidence and will not be addressed
applicant relied on evidence of his good character (including to establish his
“tendency to make sacrifices for others”)
in support of his
submission that the tendency and context evidence was inadmissible. Good
character evidence does not have this
applicant posited various “innocent” explanations for the conduct
which was the subject of evidence (such as his stroking
the complainant’s
bottom and saying, when she objected, that her “bum” was his) which
was relied on as context
and tendency evidence. He also referred to various
items of evidence which were not relied on by the Crown as either tendency or
context evidence (such as having the complainant sit on his lap when going down
a water slide). Other items to which he objected
in this Court were tendered on
his behalf at the trial (such as an email and a WhatsApp message between him and
the complainant).
These items were not relied on by the Crown as tendency or
context evidence.
Consideration
the time of the applicant’s trial, the applicable test under
was that the probative value of the evidence must outweigh (not
“significantly outweigh”, as had earlier been provided)
of unfair prejudice (by reason of amendments made by the
Evidence Amendment
(Tendency and Coincidence) Act 2020
(NSW), Sch 1, cl [4]).
97A changed the law in important respects. Authorities, such as
decided prior to s 97A. Their continued application must be assessed by
reference to that section. Further,
The Queen v Bauer
(2018) 266 CLR 56
[2018] HCA 40
) significantly qualified some aspects of
at [47]-[48]. However,
is still good law for the
propositions that the complainant’s evidence must be taken at its highest
when determining its probative
value as tendency evidence and that taking
evidence at its highest assumes that the evidence is reliable and credible:
at [39] and [50]-[52];
at [69]; and

applicant’s counsel did not object to the evidence tendered as context
evidence. The trial judge gave detailed directions
regarding the use that could
be made of context and tendency evidence.
applicant has failed to identify any matter which, even had the objection been
made at trial, ought to have led to displacement
of the presumption of
significant probative value created by s 97(2) or any error associated with the
admission of tendency and context
evidence. The correctness standard applies:
at [61]. The evidence was correctly admitted.
Accordingly,
ground 5 has not been made out.
Alleged miscarriage of justice
arising from the admission of complaint evidence (ground 10)
support of ground 10, the applicant submitted that the evidence of the five
complaint witnesses was inadmissible for the following
three reasons:
(1) it was irrelevant since the complainant’s making of a complaint could
not rationally affect the likelihood of the fact
in issue (the matter about
which she complained);
(2) it did not fall within the exception to the hearsay rule in
Evidence Act
as, having regard to the lengthy delay before she
complained, the facts could not be said to be fresh in the complainant’s
(3) the complaint evidence ought to have been excluded pursuant to
Evidence Act
on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the
danger of unfair prejudice to the applicant.
Consideration
“hearsay rule” is that evidence of a previous representation made by
a person is not admissible to prove the truth
of the fact asserted. There are
common law and statutory exceptions to this rule.
common law exceptions to the hearsay rule included an exception for complaint
evidence if it was a recent complaint of an alleged
sexual offence:
(1924) 34 CLR 154
[1924] HCA 9
) at 157 (Knox CJ,
Gavan-Duffy and Starke JJ);
Papakosomas
at [12] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J);
(2010) 79 NSWLR 629
[2010] NSWCA 181
. Although the
making of a complaint did not amount to corroboration as such, since it was not
independent of the complainant, it
was evidence of the truth of the complaint
(as an exception to the hearsay rule) and tended to confirm the
complainant’s credibility
and, therefore, to support the prosecution case:
at 157. As referred to above, the rule which required corroboration
of a child’s evidence was abolished by
relevant statutory exception to the hearsay rule was introduced by the
Evidence Act
is contained in Division 2 of Part 3.2 of the Act
which provides for exceptions to the hearsay rule for “[F]irst-hand”
hearsay. It relevantly provides:
66 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker available
(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a
person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence
asserted fact.
(2) If that person has been or is to be called to give
evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation
is given by—
(a) that person, or
(b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived
the representation being made,
if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was
fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.
(2A) In determining whether the occurrence of the
asserted fact was fresh in the memory of a person, the court may take into
account all matters that it considers are relevant to the question,
(a) the nature of the event concerned, and
(b) the age and health of the person, and
(c) the period of time between the occurrence of
the asserted fact and the making of the representation.
Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of
Australia in
Graham v The Queen
(1998) 195 CLR 606.
the complainant, who was the maker of the previous representation (being the
complaint), was available to give evidence within
the meaning of s 66(1),
s 66 applied. The effect of s 66(2) is to make admissible evidence which
the complainant gave about the complaints
she made to others and evidence which
the persons to whom she complained gave about her complaints. Because s 66
is an exception
to the hearsay rule, this evidence of a complaint (whether given
by the complainant or the person to whom the complaint was made)
is admissible
to prove the truth of the contents of the complaint.
applicant relied on
Graham v The Queen
(1998) 195 CLR 606;
[1998] HCA 61
) (in a response to which, as the note indicates, s 66(2A) was
inserted), in which the High Court held that evidence of complaint
appellant’s daughter to her friend was not admissible under
Evidence Act
because it was not “fresh in [her] memory” as
the complaint was made six years after the alleged offending conduct. In
, the High Court referred to
Since then, it has rightly come to be accepted by intermediate courts of appeal
that the nature of sexual abuse is such that it may
remain fresh in the memory
of a victim for many years. It depends on the facts of the case.
(Footnotes omitted.)
applicant’s reliance on
is, accordingly, misplaced. The
“nature of the event[s] concerned” is such that the events (weekly
sexual intercourse
between the complainant and her father, commencing when she
was about 14 years old) could be expected to remain fresh in the
complainant’s
memory well beyond their disclosure to her friends when she
was in her twenties. So too is his reliance on
, which does not apply
since the complainant and the complaint witnesses were all called as witnesses
in the trial.
only did defence counsel not object to the complaint evidence under
Evidence Act
or otherwise, but he used it forensically to seek to
impugn the complainant’s credibility by incorporating into the
applicant’s
case theory that the complainant had actively
“recruited” those witnesses to support her allegations and then
them to make notes and provide statements to the police. Defence
counsel’s reasons for taking this course is rationally capable
explanation on the basis of a perceived forensic advantage:
(Gaudron J). In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that any unfairness was
created by the admission of the evidence.
Ground 10 has not been made
Alleged miscarriage of justice arising from rejection of
evidence of the complainant’s academic success (ground 8)
referred to above, defence counsel sought to tender the complainant’s
school reports and letters of reference from the school.
These were rejected on
the basis that they were “too far removed”, constituted secondary
hearsay and were unnecessary,
given that it was not in dispute that the
complainant was a high-achieving student.
applicant argued that, had the trial judge not rejected these documents, he
could have tendered a publication by Dr Richard Gardner,
True and False
Accusations of Child and Sexual Abuse (Creative Therapeutics, New Jersey, 1992)
with a view to proving that had the
complainant been the victim of incest, she
would not have been able to perform as well as she did at school. It is unclear
publication was admissible as evidence in the trial. The provision
postulated by the applicant,
Evidence Act
(which dispenses
with proof of matters which are common knowledge) is inapplicable to such a
contentious proposition. That it does
not qualify as common knowledge is
illustrated by Dr Pulman’s evidence (summarised above) that a victim of
child sexual abuse
can still “do certain activities or sporting things.
And so that’s not unusual for a child to appear to the general world
being happy [and] normal”.
to the complaint about the school records and references, these have been
addressed with respect to ground 2.
Alleged miscarriage of
justice arising from the use of an audio-visual link for JK’s evidence
set out above in the narrative of the evidence at the trial, defence counsel
agreed that the only practical way for JK to give
evidence was for her to give
it remotely. The trial judge had power to permit this to occur: see the
discussion in
(2017) 95 NSWLR 767
[2017] NSWCCA 249
If this had not been permitted, the only option would have been to discharge the
jury and stand over the proceedings to be listed
some time in the future when
the COVID-19 restrictions were no longer required.
applicant argued in this Court that the taking of JK’s evidence by AVL
deprived the jury of the opportunity to assess her
credibility and thereby
caused a miscarriage of justice. The applicant is bound by the eminently
reasonable concession made by defence
counsel that JK’s evidence ought be
taken by AVL. Leave to appeal ought be refused in respect of this
Grounds challenging the conduct of the prosecutor
are several grounds which relate to alleged impropriety of the prosecutor.
General principles relating to the role of counsel
have been summarised above.
The role of prosecutor is different from that of defence counsel. The principles
relating to a determination
whether a prosecutor has exceeded proper boundaries
in the closing address are set out below immediately preceding the grounds which
relate to that matter.
Alleged withholding or late disclosure of
evidence by the prosecution (ground 4B)
Alleged failure by the prosecutor to present the whole evidence of the
case (ground 4F)
applicant submitted that the prosecutor had breached Barristers Rules,
r 83, which relevantly provides that “[a] prosecutor
must fairly
assist the court to arrive at the truth, must seek impartially to have the whole
of the relevant evidence placed intelligibly
before the court ...”.
applicant alleged that the prosecutor had breached r 83 by failing to adduce
evidence of the following, which will be addressed
(1) the complainant’s motive to accuse him of criminal conduct;
(2) documentary evidence of the complainant’s scholastic achievements;
(3) alleged changes in the complainant’s account of the alleged
(4) a note made by the complainant addressed to her mother about her mental
health; and
(5) the lack of accusations made by other children who had been in the
applicant’s care.
Alleged failure to adduce evidence of the complainant’s motive to
accuse the applicant
material in the prosecution brief contained a reference to JK telling the
complainant that there was a possibility that she could
sue the applicant for
damages. If relevant, this evidence related to the complainant’s
credibility and therefore was arguably
inadmissible in the Crown case:
Evidence Act
. However, it fell within the exception in
Evidence Act
, which permits evidence relevant to credibility to be
adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially
affect the credibility of the witness. Thus, defence counsel was entitled to,
and did, cross-examine the complainant about this exchange
with her mother. In
the exchange, the complainant accepted that her mother had told her of that
possibility.
reference in r 83 to “the whole of the relevant evidence” can only
be a reference to the whole of the
evidence. There was no
arguable breach of r 83 by the prosecutor’s failure to adduce evidence
that JK had made the complainant
aware of the possibility that she could claim
damages against the applicant.
Alleged failure to tender
documentary evidence of the complainant’s scholastic achievements
trial judge’s rejection of evidence of the complainant’s scholastic
achievements has been addressed elsewhere in these
reasons. The
prosecutor’s obligation under Barristers Rules, r 83, is to seek “to
have the whole of the evidence
intelligibly
before the court”. The
word “intelligibly” qualifies the obligation since it is a necessary
part of the prosecutor’s
function to ensure that evidence which is
superfluous or of marginal relevance is
tendered (although it must,
nonetheless, be disclosed). If prosecutors did not put the whole of the evidence
intelligibly
before the court, but simply tendered the whole prosecution
brief, trials would quickly become unworkable and unwieldy, to no good
which would be inimical both to the administration, and the interests, of
justice. The cost would become ruinous for the
community and there would be many
fewer people who could sit on juries because trials would be disproportionately
was no obligation on the prosecutor to tender evidence of the
complainant’s scholastic achievements. There was, as referred
to above, no
error in the trial judge rejecting these documents when defence counsel sought
to tender them.
Alleged failure to adduce evidence of the
alleged changes in the complainant’s account of the alleged
applicant submitted that the prosecutor concealed the version of the offending
given by the complainant to her then boyfriend
(that she had been raped several
times a week). He submitted that this evidence tended to impugn the
complainant’s credibility
and ought not to have been concealed by the
Crown and, indeed, ought to have been led by the Crown.
reject this submission. The prosecutor disclosed, as part of the brief which was
served on the applicant’s legal representatives,
the statement of the
complainant’s then boyfriend, Mr T. The prosecutor called Mr T in the
Crown case and Mr T gave evidence
that in September 2017, the complainant told
him what had happened, as follows:
She told me that it had happened after she moved from Melbourne to Sydney, and
she had felt quite cut off from her friends. And as
an immigrant, she
didn’t have any other family in the country.
She also indicated the
frequency, which was quite shocking, as she said it was multiple times a week
and often consistently on a weekly
. And she also indicated that it
wasn’t just grooming and inappropriate touching, but it was penetration
and sexual assault.
And she felt quite emotionally manipulated into the
situation as her father would not be violent, but would give her silent
or treat her quite negatively until she relented again and gave in.
(Emphasis added.)
was neither concealment of this evidence, nor a failure to adduce it as part of
the Crown case. This sub-ground has no basis.
Alleged failure to
adduce evidence of the complainant’s note to JK regarding her mental
support of this sub-ground, the applicant alleged that the prosecutor failed to
tender the complainant’s handwritten note
to JK which is attachment A to
his affidavit of 17 January 2025 and has already been addressed in connection
with ground 2. No legitimate
criticism could be levelled at the prosecutor for
not tendering the note, which, at best, was marginally relevant to the
complainant’s
credibility and therefore not admissible by reason of
Evidence Act
Alleged failure to tender evidence of
the lack of accusations made by other children who had been in the
applicant’s care
applicant submitted that the prosecutor was bound to adduce evidence that he had
not sexually assaulted another young girl who
was in his care from time to time.
The only possible relevance of this evidence was as to the applicant’s
good character. The
prosecution has no obligation to adduce such evidence. The
evidence was, in any event, irrelevant to the Crown case since it was
alleged that the applicant had sexually assaulted anyone other than the
complainant.
of the sub-grounds of ground 4F has been made out. It overlaps with ground 4B
which, likewise, has not been made out. Leave ought
be refused in respect of
grounds 4B and 4F.
Alleged improper conduct by prosecutor by
persistently relying on evidence of no, or low, probative value (ground
evidence which is the subject of this ground comprises: the evidence of Dr
Pulman; tendency and context evidence; the evidence
of JK; and the complaint
evidence. Each of these witnesses and categories of evidence have been addressed
in connection with other
grounds of appeal and do not need to be addressed
separately here. Ground 4G has not been made out. Leave ought be
Alleged impropriety in causing the jury to draw improper
inferences (ground 4D)
applicant submitted that the prosecutor caused or influenced the jury to draw
improper inferences concerning what was on the applicant’s
work computer
at CSIRO (being the applicant’s work place). His submission appears to
have been based on the false premise that
the prosecutor asked the question
whether anything untoward was found on the applicant’s computer. In fact,
it was defence
counsel who elicited that evidence which was of forensic benefit
to the applicant.
way in which the matter arose was as follows. The question of what was on the
applicant’s computer was raised by defence
counsel on the third day of the
trial. In the absence of the jury, defence counsel asked the prosecutor whether
the Officer in Charge
of the investigation (the OIC) could confirm that the
applicant’s computer had been investigated and nothing untoward had been
found on it. The prosecutor confirmed that he could. When the OIC, Detective
Senior Constable Scott Tindale was cross-examined by
defence counsel on the
seventh day of the trial, he confirmed that there had been a “detailed
forensic analysis” of the
applicant’s workplace computer. He was
not, however, asked whether anything untoward was found on that computer. It
would appear
that this was an oversight by defence counsel because, on the
eighth day of the trial, defence counsel told the trial judge that
have taken the next step of confirming that there was nothing untoward found on
the computer. The prosecutor agreed to
re-call the OIC for that purpose. Later
that day, the prosecutor informed the trial judge in the presence of the jury
that defence
counsel required the OIC to be re-called for “a very narrow
piece of evidence”. This evidence was given by the OIC and
the witness
conduct of the prosecutor was appropriate, proper and co-operative. No criticism
could be made of the way in which he dealt with
the request from the defence.
Leave ought be refused for ground 4D.
Alleged improper
cross-examination of the applicant by the prosecutor (ground 4H)
applicant submitted that several aspects of the prosecutor’s
cross-examination of him were improper. Some of these submissions
can usefully
be addressed by reference to categories, while others contain specific
criticisms which need to be addressed separately.
These will be addressed in
Allegation that the prosecutor’s mode of
cross-examination of the applicant disadvantaged the applicant and caused a
fundamental
error (ground 4H)
applicant accepted that the prosecutor was entitled to put the Crown case
“fully and, where appropriate, forcefully”
cross-examination. However, he instanced several examples where he submitted
that the prosecutor had gone beyond the bounds
of what was proper. These fall
into five categories which will be addressed in turn:
(1) instances where the prosecutor put the Crown case to the applicant for the
purposes of compliance with
Browne v Dunn
(1894) 6 R 67;
(2) instances where the prosecutor put the evidence of prosecution witnesses to
the applicant and invited his response;
(3) instances where the prosecutor was apparently laying a foundation for a
closing submission as to how a document ought be interpreted;
(4) instances where the applicant was invited to comment whether the
complainant’s evidence was false; and
(5) instances where the applicant was invited to speculate about what was going
on in the mind of another witness.
(1) Cross-examination for the purposes of putting the
Crown case to the applicant to invite his response
so-called “rule” in
Browne v Dunn
was explained by Lord
Herschell LC in
Browne v Dunn
itself as follows:
... where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on
a particular point, to direct his attention to the
fact by some questions put in
cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not
to take his evidence
and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and
then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have
able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is
suggested indicate that the story he tells ought
not to be believed, to argue
that he is a witness unworthy of credit... If you intend to impeach a witness
you are bound, whilst
he is in the box, to give him an opportunity of making any
explanation which is open to him ...
is, in substance, a rule of practice which has the purpose of advancing fairness
and according with the rules of procedural fairness:
see the discussion in
Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation
(Cth) [1983]
1 NSWLR 1 at 16 (Hunt J). Its application in criminal trials is qualified and it
tends not to be enforced against an
accused. Further, it is not always necessary
for the prosecutor to put the entirety of the evidence in the Crown case to an
in cross-examination since the evidence has already been led and
therefore the accused can be taken to be on notice of it. However,
desirable that the Crown case in substance be put to an accused to permit the
accused to respond. The limits of the rule in
criminal cases do not arise for
consideration in the present case, since the criticism of the prosecutor is that
he put too much
to the applicant in cross-examination, rather than that he
failed to put something which ought to have been put.
category includes a large number of questions extracted from the transcript. It
is not necessary to reproduce them all to deal
with the ground since a sample is
sufficient. This category includes the following
“... in that one month, where there were weekly massages, [the
complainant] felt exposed because--”
“There was a computer with pornography”
“You took her to nudist places because you wanted, from a very young
age, to prime her. You wanted her to be comfortable with
nudity, didn’t
“When she would be swimming in the swimming pool, that’s why
you would-you heard her give evidence -you would dive under
and you would look
at her, when she was fully naked, under the swimming pool.”
“You went from nudity to then nude massages. What I’m asking
you is, can you see that there is, from one, the building
“And from nude massages, you would sexualise your daughter by making
little jokes about what was on TV.”
“Part of that isolation she felt that she really, the only love that
she could get was from that house you were living in.”
“That is why you used protection, because you were very concerned
regard each of these questions as constituting the prosecutor’s fulfilment
of his duty to put the Crown case to the applicant
to give him an opportunity of
responding. I am not persuaded that the prosecutor has gone beyond proper bounds
in formulating questions
in this way.
(2) cross-examination of
the applicant where the prosecutor put the evidence of prosecution witnesses to
the applicant and invited
his response
category comprises the following
“When she would be swimming in the swimming pool, that’s why
you would-you heard her give evidence -you would dive under
and you would look
at her, when she was fully naked, under the swimming pool.”
“These naked massages that continued well after 2013.”
“They only stopped when she moved to Adelaide.”
“In fact, you heard her evidence that is the reason why she moved to
“Why would [JK] say, ‘leave [the complainant]
“And [JK] was distressed because she had had enough of you having sex
with her daughter?”
“[The complainant’s] evidence was she would be horrified if her
mother came in and saw the two of you having sex.”
“[The complainant] also said that it was a process of grooming, that
in her mind made what you did to her normal?”
“That’s [the alleged offending] the reason why [the
complainant] left Sydney and moved to Adelaide.”
“She moved to Adelaide because she wanted to get away from

issue which arises in considering category (2) was considered by this Court
(Giles JA, Howie and Fullerton JJ) in
Gonzales v R
[2007] NSWCCA 321
(2007) 178 A Crim R 232
) as follows:
(1998) 102 A Crim R 165
it was said at
169 that a witness should not be “invited to express an opinion about the
truthfulness of another”, referring
, with risk of reversal of the onus of proof. (As to that risk, see
[2007] SASC 119
R v Gilbert
December 1998, unreported) Grove J, with whom Levine and Dowd JJ agreed, said
that the “essence” of the vice
in such a cross-examination was as
summarised in
, namely that the witness was invited “to
enter the complainant’s mind and say whether the false assertion is due to
malice, mistake or any other cause”. In
R v Buckley
[2004] VSCA 185
(2004) 149 A Crim R 122
the Court of Appeal in Victoria expressed the
prohibition that a witness can not be asked in cross-examination “whether
witness is telling lies or has invented something”.
151 I do not think that the cross-examination of which the
appellant complained offended these principles. The appellant had not
evidence in chief addressed the evidence tendered in the Crown case in any
detail, and
it was appropriate for the Crown Prosecutor to confront him with
what had been said in evidence by or through Crown witnesses. Asking
appellant whether the witness was wrong was a permissible way of doing so, and I
do not think the cross-examination trespassed
into asking the appellant to
express an opinion on whether the witnesses were lying or had invented their
evidence or otherwise why
their evidence was incorrect
(Emphasis added.)
distinction between what is proper and what is not was explained in
(Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 19 December 1994, unrep, Grove J
(Abadee and Simpson JJ agreeing)) (
), which was cited in
at [149]. The Court in
explained that while it was proper to
make a “simple enquiry of one witness whether another is telling the
was impermissible and improper to invite the witness to comment
the evidence of another witness differed from the subject
witness’ evidence or to invite an accused to comment about the
truthfulness
of another witness’ evidence. The latter category is
particularly improper where the inquiry is made of an accused as to why
complainant would lie because it has the effect of reversing the onus of proof:
Palmer v The Queen
(1998) 193 CLR 1
[1998] HCA 2.
As the Court (Brennan
CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ) said at [10]:
It is necessary to distinguish between cross-examination of a witness as to the
motive of that witness to lie and cross-examination
of another witness designed
to show that that witness does not know of any fact from which to infer that the
first witness had a
motive to lie. ...
principles were summarised by Hall J in
[2014] NSWCCA 138
[T]he well-established principles that apply to a witness, including in
particular an accused person, invited in cross-examination
to express an opinion
as to whether another witness was lying [are as follows]:
(i) Cross-examination of a witness which involves putting to
the witness a question as to whether another person is lying or has
something is impermissible:
R v Praturlon
(CCA, 29 November 1985,
unreported).
(ii) A question of that kind is impermissible as it seeks to
have the witness express an opinion as to whether other witnesses
are telling
the truth, that is, to impugn their truthfulness:
Gonzales v R
(iii) It is permissible to ask a witness whether what another
witness has said is true. The witness may be asked if he/she knows
of any reason
why the other witness should be hostile to him/her or should tell a false story
(1969) SASR 172.
(iv) If the witness says that what the other witness has said
is not true, he/she should not be asked to enter into the witness’s
and say whether he/she thinks the inaccuracy is due to invention, malice,
mistake or any other cause. To do so is to ask him/her
for opinion evidence:
, supra, at 173-4 per Bray CJ, Hogarth and Walters JJ.
(v) If a witness is asked to express an opinion as to whether
other witnesses are telling the truth and that the party affected
accused person) suffers prejudice as a result of such impermissible questioning,
then a miscarriage of justice may be found
to have occurred.
one exception, question (j), I am not persuaded that the prosecutor in any of
the questions in category (2) invited the applicant
to comment on the reason for
the inconsistency between the witness’ evidence and his own. Rather, as
part of putting the prosecution
case to the applicant, the prosecutor put the
substance of the witness’ evidence to the applicant to give him a chance
to respond.
The prosecutor did not exceed the proper bounds of cross-examination
in respect of these questions.
(j) is in a different category because, on its face, it invites the applicant to
comment on what was in the mind of JK when
she asked the applicant, in writing,
to leave the complainant alone. This question is addressed in category (3)
(3) Cross-examination of the applicant where the
prosecutor was apparently laying a foundation for a closing submission as to how
a document ought be interpreted
“Why would [JK] say, ‘leave [the complainant]
“That’s why ... it was then that [JK] said, ‘Leave [the
complainant] alone,’ and it was because you were having
sex with her
daughter, your daughter.”
questions in this category involved the prosecutor asking the applicant why JK
would ask him to “[l]eave [the complainant]
alone” and putting to
him the Crown case as to the reasons. Although on its face, this question would
appear to invite comment
in substance, an invitation to offer a different interpretation than that
which the Crown contended: namely, that JK was asking the applicant to cease
sexual contact with the complainant.
a matter of fairness, it was necessary for the Crown to put this document to the
applicant and given him an opportunity to respond
to the Crown’s
interpretation of the words used. Had the prosecutor not done so, defence
counsel may have reasonably objected
to the submission in closing address on the
basis that the applicant had not had a chance to respond to it. Alternatively,
counsel could have made something of the prosecutor’s failure to
afford the applicant an opportunity to say what he actually
understood by the
document, which was an email which was addressed to him. There was no
impropriety in this
(4) Cross-examination of the applicant
where the applicant is invited to comment whether the complainant’s
evidence was false
questions in this category are as
[in response to the accused’s ongoing denial that the complainant was
isolated or lacking friends] “So, her evidence that
she didn’t have
close friends to start with is just false, is that what you are saying?”
“When she gave evidence that you [would] ice her out, and you [would]
be very frosty to her, you would ignore her, you would
make her feel as though
she was very alone in the house. That is just made up is it?”
understand the Crown to accept that these two questions may be regarded as
contrary to
(Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 29
November 1985, unrep) and
. However, the Crown submitted that,
notwithstanding the impropriety of these questions, there has been no
miscarriage of justice.
I accept this submission. These were two questions in
the 33 pages of transcript of cross-examination of the applicant. The applicant
was, at all times, steadfast in his denials of any sexual contact between him
and the complainant and was not, in any way, drawn
to comment in the proscribed
when the applicant’s responses to these objectionable questions are
considered, it is plain that he was able to deal
exchange which included question (h) was:
Q. So, her evidence that she didn’t have close friends to start with is
just false, is that what you are saying?
this question was inappropriate, it elicited no greater response than had the
proposition been put to him in an appropriate
way (by asking him whether he
accepted the underlying proposition to be correct).
exchange which included question (o) was:
Q. When she gave evidence that you were ice her out, and you were [sic] be very
frosty to her, you would ignore her, you would make
her feel as though she was
very alone in the house. That is just made up is it?
A. She also told you that I never raised my voice. This was the way I
communicated my disappointment in her on rare cases when I
was disappointed,
because mostly I was proud of her.
the question ought not to have been asked in that form, the answer given would,
in substance, have been the same had the question
been put appropriately
(“You would ice her out, be frosty to her, make her feel alone in the
house, wouldn’t you?”).
these two questions would appear to have gone beyond the bounds of what was
proper, I do not consider that they gave rise
to any miscarriage of justice,
either individually or together with any other aspects of the cross-examination
of the applicant addressed
(5) Cross-examination of the applicant
where the applicant was invited to speculate about what was going on in the mind
witness or asked how he felt about particular evidence
“Because in the following day when there was a confrontation between
all three of you, you told [JK], ‘I’ll take
you dragging..(not
transcribable..[down with me] if you go to the police.”
“That’s why it took her so long to prepare a statement because
she was scared.”
“That was part of the reason she would close her eyes during sex
because she felt ashamed, didn’t she?”
“This is the reason why [JK] ended up having to do an induced
statement because she was too frightened to go to police.”
“You heard her evidence that she was terrified that she would be
“How did you feel when you heard the evidence from Nicola Amos when
she said that your daughter felt like an orphan growing
“They [friends of the complainant who gave evidence] just said that
it was a strange family relationship.”
“If you had done your research, as you say that you would have, you
would have known that the ‘Dressed to Kill’
book, the theories
behind it was completely debunked. It was considered a quackery.” [in
circumstances where there was no evidence
outside the Crown Prosecutor’s
question regarding the accuracy of the book]
prosecutor ought not to have invited the applicant to speculate about what was
in the complainant’s mind (as clearly occurred
in question (q) or in
JK’s mind (as occurred in question (v)).
(w) was inappropriate because it appeared designed to elicit an emotive response
from the jury by referring to the evidence
of one of the complaint witnesses
that the complainant felt like an orphan when she was growing up. Further, how
the applicant felt
inadmissible.
(ee) was improper because it was argumentative and introduced material which had
no foundation in the evidence (that the
theories in
Dressed to Kill
been debunked). It also appeared to ridicule the applicant in a way which
appeared designed to rile him.
the applicant’s response to that question is telling and indicates that he
was well able to respond, apparently without
losing his equanimity (in so far as
that matter can be judged from the transcript). The exchange followed the
applicant’s evidence
that he was aware but had not read a book called
“Dressed to Kill”, in which the theory was propounded that
constricting
lymphatic regions of the body (breasts) increases the risk of
cancer. The cross-examination continued:
Q. If you had done your research, as you say that you would have, you would have
known that the “Dressed To Kill” book,
the theories behind it was
completely debunked. It was considered a quackery.
A Right, but if you do your research now, you will find that most web pages that
say that breast cancer is not harmful or not correlated
with - sorry, bras are
not harmful and not correlated with - with breast cancer, they go to a single
article that described the study
that is limited to postmenopausal women.
Q. But [the complainant] wasn’t postmenopausal, was she?
A Yes. She wasn’t.
Q. She wasn’t. In fact--
A You probably didn’t understand. The study that says that breast cancer
is not harmful is limited to postmenopausal women.
There are no studies that
they could find that say the same about teenagers.
Q. This thing about breast cancer is complete nonsense; isn’t it?
A To you - to you, yes; to a parent, no.
the questions in this category might appear to have gone beyond the bounds of
what is permissible for a prosecutor, their
effect on either the applicant and
the jury was, in my view, in the context of the trial as a whole and the
applicant’s evidence,
in particular, minimal. This may explain why no
objection was taken to these questions and why the experienced trial judge did
intervene to reject the questions pursuant to
Evidence Act
(which, in terms, requires a judge to disallow a question “if the
court is of the opinion that the question is ... offensive
... or put ... in a
manner or tone that is belittling, insulting or otherwise
inappropriate...”. I am not persuaded that any
of these questions,
individually or in combination, posed a risk of miscarriage of justice, as
outlined above.
Other challenges made to the prosecutor’s
cross-examination of the applicant (ground 11)
Cross-examination regarding observations made by the applicant of the
complainant while she was in the pool (ground 11A)
complainant gave evidence (extracted above) that when she was swimming laps,
naked, in the pool, the applicant would “often
swim just behind [her] or
if he was like waiting at and [sic – an] end he’d, like,
down below the water as [she] was approaching the end” when she was
turning around. The prosecutor put to the applicant that
under and ... look at [the complainant]”.
applicant submitted that his actions were consistent with his observing the
complainant’s turning technique but that this
questioning was improper as
the prosecutor insinuated that he dove under the complainant in order to look at
her nude body and imputed
“sinister motives” to him. The applicant
submitted, incorrectly, that the prosecutor had referred to this in his closing
address but, in fact, it occurred in cross-examination.
regard the difference between “duck[ing] down” and “div[ing]
under” as being semantic in circumstances where
it was common ground that
the applicant was also in the pool with the complainant. As to the alleged
imputation of sinister motives,
the prosecutor was obliged to put the Crown case
and his questioning was part of his doing so. I would refuse leave for ground
Allegation that the applicant had touched the
complainant’s vaginal area during naked massages (ground 11)
set out above, the prosecutor put to the applicant that when he gave the
complainant naked massages after the sexual intercourse
stopped, he touched her
vaginal area. The applicant submitted that this cross-examination was improper
as the complainant had not
given that evidence herself.
consider that the prosecutor had a sufficient basis for the cross-examination
(for the purposes of compliance with Barristers Rules,
r 67) in paragraph 101 of
the complainant’s police statement dated 13 July 2018 that during naked
massages which occurred after
the sexual intercourse stopped and continued until
she moved out, the applicant would “graze the outer lips of [her]
even though the complainant had not given that evidence.
it would usually be inappropriate for a prosecutor to seek to elicit, by way of
admission in cross-examination of an accused,
something of which the complainant
has not given evidence in chief. That said, it is understandable that, just as
the trial judge
failed to recall or appreciate that the complainant had not
given such evidence in the trial (although it had been adduced on a
), the prosecutor also failed to recall or appreciate that he had not
elicited that evidence in evidence in chief of the complainant
(who would,
presumably, have given such evidence had she been asked). So too did defence
counsel and the applicant himself presumably
fail to notice the disparity
between what the complainant had said (or, rather, not said) and what the
prosecutor put. In these circumstances,
it is understandable that the prosecutor
put the question, that the defence counsel failed to object and that the trial
judge included
it, erroneously, in her Honour’s summing up.
this aspect of the trial indicates is that trials are demanding and human
recollection is fallible. The speed with which trials
are conducted means that
barristers and judges must rely on memory without immediate recourse to
transcript when examining, cross-examining,
formulating objections and
identifying disparities in a summing up. I am satisfied that the
prosecutor’s cross-examination
of the applicant about his touching the
complainant’s vagina ought not to have occurred. However, it did not cause
any miscarriage
of justice. The applicant denied it and the prosecutor moved on
to his next question.
Alleged impropriety in the
prosecutor’s closing address by making improper closing submissions
(ground 4C)
the reasons given below ground 4C has not been made out. Leave should be refused
in respect of each of these grounds.
General principles
a much-cited passage, this Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Johnson and Latham JJ) in
R v Livermore
(2006) 67 NSWLR 659
[2006] NSWCCA 334
identified, at [31]:
... a number of features of a Crown address that have, either alone or in
combination, consistently been held to justify the censure
of this Court ...:
(i) A submission to the jury based upon
material which is not in evidence.
(ii) Intemperate or inflammatory
comments, tending to arouse prejudice or emotion in the jury.
(iii) Comments which belittle or
ridicule any part of an accused’s case.
(iv) Impugning the credit of a
Crown witness, where the witness was not afforded the opportunity of responding
to an attack
upon credit.
(v) Conveying to the jury the
Crown Prosecutor’s personal opinions.
counselled against adopting “a formulaic
approach” to the determination of whether a Crown address “exceeds
proper boundaries”. In other words, the effect of the
prosecutor’s conduct must be judged by reference to the particular
and circumstances of the trial under consideration.
[2013] NSWCCA 317
; (2013) A Crim R 321, this Court referred to
the use of rhetoric by a prosecutor in final address at [116]:
... the duties of a prosecutor are not inconsistent with the use of rhetoric. In
a circumstantial case where the Crown must exclude
all reasonable hypotheses
consistent with innocence, a prosecutor may, in the course of final address, be
obliged in the course of
forceful presentation of the Crown case to disparage
versions given by the accused on the grounds that they do not fit with the
surrounding
facts and circumstances or are, for other reasons, not to be
accepted. Less formal language, including vernacular phrases, may appropriately
be used to persuade the jury to exclude those hypotheses consistent with
innocence. The responsibilities of the prosecutor do not
preclude resort to
colourful language as a tool of persuasion.
Alleged improper submissions made by the prosecutor in closing address
(ground 4C)
applicant relied on several extracts from the transcript of the
prosecutor’s closing address in support of ground 4C. In
order to address
them, they will be extracted below and numbered for ease of reference, in the
order in which they appear in the
closing address. However, it is important to
note that, while the jury was given a transcript of the evidence of the
witnesses, it
was not given a transcript of the addresses or the summing up.
Thus, for the course of their deliberations, the jury had the evidence
witnesses but no record of the addresses other than those which they may have
made by hand during the course of their delivery.
The trial judge directed the
jury that it was important that they bore in mind what counsel said to them in
address but that they
must decide the case on the
Alleged “mangling” of quotations
the transcript of addresses, the Crown is recorded as having read out passages
from the transcript to the jury. The transcript
writer has not transcribed the
whole quotation, but rather its beginning and indicated that other words were
said by inserting “...”.
This is not uncommon when counsel is
reading verbatim from another document.
applicant submitted that this amounted to a “mangling” of quotations
from the evidence and amounted to a “word
salad” which would have
confused the jury. The conventional inference can be drawn – that the
transcript writers did
not see fit to transcribe all of what was read out but
identify it by the prefatory words. Further, this method had no capacity to
confuse the jury because they heard the actual words spoken by the prosecutor
and were not given the transcript of addresses in any
Submission as to the alleged entitlement of the
applicant identified the following as an improper submission:
Now, that the Crown would say is a form of entitlement. He felt entitled to do

her that she shouldn’t be quitting her job and
shouldn’t be doing this. Yes, he was proud and invested as a father to
that degree, but the Crown would say it also demonstrates that he was someone
who was very entitled and felt like he could do what
he’d want to and that
to an extent he owned his daughter. Much like when the complainant said when she
was late for these 5.30
appointments on occasion, the accused come looking for
her and say where are you, it’s 5.30.
family circumstances of the applicant and the complainant were the subject of
substantial evidence. The applicant had led evidence
of his daughter’s
lifestyle, how she conducted herself and how he had attempted, as effectively a
sole parent, to control her,
purportedly for her own good. The
prosecutor’s rhetoric in Crown closing did not go beyond the bounds of
what was appropriate.
The significance of the alleged offending
taking place in the applicant’s bedroom
prosecutor said of the location of the alleged offending:
These things all, when you put them together, in the context of it happening in
his bedroom, in the context of it starting with kissing,
and then leading to
penile-vaginal intercourse, it all had the aura, if you like, of them having a
sexual relationship, which is
why in cross-examination I asked the accused,
“Why your bedroom?” That is significant because it adds to his own
understanding
of what it was, this sexual relationship in his mind, not perhaps
unlawful, but unlawful because under 16, and his daughter.
was a significant part of the Crown case that the naked massages, which led to
penile-vaginal sexual intercourse, took place in
the applicant’s
rather than in
the lounge room
, where the naked massages
between the applicant and JK had taken place. The location formed part of the
Crown’s circumstantial
case that the “naked massages” were not
innocent and started as grooming behaviour and later served as foreplay as well
as the aftermath of sexual intercourse between the applicant and the
complainant. The hypothesis consistent with innocence advanced
by the applicant
was that he had innocent naked massages with the complainant as he was a
practising nudist and this was normal behaviour
with no sexual connotation. The
Crown was entitled to emphasise the location of the massages and the alleged
offending in its closing
The conversation between the
applicant and JK about the sex education of the complainant
prosecutor referred to JK’s evidence that, while they were still living in
Melbourne, the applicant had asked her whether
he could engage in sex education
of the complainant and that JK had agreed. He submitted, in closing
What you’d accept, members of the jury, is what [JK] said when he asked
her if he could have sexual education with [the complainant],
and that was what
he meant to have sex with her, and he basically over time groom her to be his -
so that she could comply with him
applicant submitted that this conversation could not rationally have had
anything to do with the alleged sexual intercourse because
it took place in
Melbourne several years before the alleged intercourse commenced. I consider
that it was open to the prosecutor
to make this submission. That the
conversation had occurred was significant to the Crown case that the applicant
had maintained an
unlawful sexual relationship with the complainant
acquiescence and complicity of JK
. The Crown case, supported by JK’s
evidence, was that JK was loath to have intercourse with the applicant herself
and positively
encouraged the complainant to be the substitute (by telling her
how happy she had made her father by allowing the intercourse). It
was open to
the jury to infer that the conversation in Melbourne amounted to the applicant
testing JK to see whether she would stand
in the way of a sexual relationship
between the applicant and the complainant. In these circumstances, it was not
material that the
conversation occurred some time before the actual sexual
intercourse took place since it was, on the Crown case, preparatory to the
initiation and maintenance of such a relationship by the applicant. The
prosecutor was entitled to put the Crown case in this way
The arrangements made by the complainant to move to
Adelaide from Sydney before the applicant knew that he was going to be
prosecutor made the following submission regarding the complainant’s final
move from Sydney to Adelaide:
But when you look at it all carefully and the surrounding circumstances, it
completely fits, like her conduct in having made arrangements
for personal items
to be sent from Sydney to Adelaide before anything would be revealed in terms of
charging. Perfectly makes sense.
She is, again, lining up her ducks. Keeping him
out of the loop whilst going ahead with the charging process makes sense. She
evidence, very clear evidence, of the coercive control and the control the
accused wielded over her and having that geographical
space was what she felt
needed to make the necessary arrangements.
applicant submitted that this submission was incorrect as the complainant had in
fact moved her possessions to Adelaide in 2017
she had met with
her friend, DM (who was one of the complaint witnesses), who had allegedly
assisted her to report the matter. The
applicant had various theories about the
way in which the matter was reported and the immediate chronology prior to his
being charged
which he submitted showed that the complainant was not to be
believed (the detail of which is not necessary to address). The prosecutor
obliged and entitled to put the Crown case and, in doing so, to explain why the
complainant felt sufficiently secure in Adelaide,
which is geographically far
removed from the applicant’s location in Sydney, to report the matter to
police there. I am not
persuaded that there was anything improper in this
submission.
The submission about the complainant’s attempts to be out of the family
prosecutor addressed the aspect of the Crown case that may, but for the evidence
of Dr Pulman, have seemed counterintuitive to
the jurors: that the complainant
continued to live with the applicant after her mother had left. He
Now, that evidence is incisive, because it shows her inner workings and
she’s able to say to you that it was because of her
isolation and the
sense of inevitability. It was inevitable that this would just continue and that
giving in was her only option.
Now, again, you cannot divorce the allegations
from the surrounding circumstances. This wasn’t someone who had an
family, who had older siblings, younger siblings, who had an
established network in Sydney. This was someone who, in her own words
complaint witness] said, “I felt [like] an orphan.” She spoke about
the fact that she was the only child and
that she would, as best she could, try
and be out of the house as much as possible.
applicant challenged this passage on the basis that it was factually wrong since
the complainant could have moved out with her
mother or moved out with friends.
This is not a proper objection to a Crown closing submission. The prosecutor was
entitled to put
the Crown case, which included explaining why the complainant
felt unable to leave her father earlier than she did.
prosecutor’s submission about the complainant having a “crystal
clear memory”
applicant challenged the prosecutor’s submission that the complainant had
an “almost crystal clear memory” of
the first occasion on which the
applicant showed pornography to her, as follows:
She gave a very clear and almost crystal clear memory the first time when, or
one of the times that she was being shown pornography,
where she was actually
sitting on his lap, and with one hand he was using the mouse to open up various
scenes, if you like, whilst
it was on mute, and with his other hand he’d
use to stimulate her clitoris. He’d ask her, “Did you orgasm? Have
you finished?”.
applicant submitted that this was not a fair summary of the complainant’s
evidence which was, at times, vague and lacked
specificity in terms of dates and
times. That the complainant’s evidence about dates and times was, in
various ways, non-specific
does not make the extract from the Crown closing
submission set out above inappropriate. The prosecutor was implicitly
contrasting
the detail with which the complainant recalled the first occasion on
which the applicant showed pornography to her with her evidence,
which was not
as specific in respect of other occasions. No impropriety has been established
in respect of this passage.
Conversations between the applicant
and the complainant during massage sessions
applicant also challenged the following passage from the closing
[The complainant] says that when she was there during the massaging, he would
talk to her. Just think in your mind’s eye, think
of what that leads to,
or what the purpose of that is. It’s acting as a confidant. It has the
sense of it being a relationship.
reject the applicant’s submission that this was an improper submission for
the prosecutor to make. It was the Crown case that
the applicant was maintaining
an unlawful relationship with the complainant which included unlawful sexual
acts. The prosecutor was
obliged to put the case by reference to the evidence of
what occurred.
The 2013 confrontation between the applicant and
JK which caused JK to send an email to the applicant asking him to “leave
complainant] alone”
applicant challenged the following submission in the Crown closing:
So, this set a very different complexion. This argument wasn’t about
sexual abuse because on the accused’s version ‘leave
complainant] alone’ was not about, it was in a sense [JK’s] way of
trying to frame him. That is a version that is
simply implausible. It is bereft
of any reality. When you look at the surrounding circumstances. And, then you go
to exhibit [5]
where three years later, in 2016, there’s this conversation
time that [JK]
has given her induced statement than what 2013 is, that’s a very important
detail, but putting that to one side,
you need to look at ... exhibit 5, sorry -
because that is what shows the two people – [JK] and the accused -
conversing about
divorce, and it’s not in terms of being acrimonious or
messy or a nasty divorce, or any suggestion that there’s framing
to use [the complainant] as leverage by saying leave [the complainant] alone.
this extract from the closing address, the prosecutor was seeking to refute the
anticipated submission to be made in the defence
closing that JK’s request
that he leave the complainant alone ought be seen through the prism of divorce
proceedings where
a couple might use a child for leverage between them. The
prosecutor submitted that this was
the situation and that, in fact,
the email in which the request was made was sent because JK was aware that the
applicant was having
sexual intercourse with the complainant and JK wanted him
to stop. Once again, the prosecutor had an obligation to put the Crown
which is that this was what the email meant and that this was the way in which
the jury ought understand it. There was no impropriety
in this aspect of the
closing address.
Whether “use of protection” could
amount to corroboration and enhance the credibility of JK and the
complainant
prosecutor submitted:
We know - and [JK] gave evidence of this - there was a conversation between her
and the accused where he told her that he was using
protection. We know from
[the complainant] that when sexual intercourse occurred there was protection.
Corroboration. They’re
corroborating one another. It goes to their
credibility. So, whilst you might have a certain view of [JK] - and as I told
is not on trial. You can think whatever you like of her morals-
you’re here to assess her credibility, and to some extent she’s
to bolster the credibility of [the complainant] because she’s able to
corroborate some of the things that [the complainant]
applicant submitted that both JK and the complainant were lying when they gave
evidence about his using “protection”,
that is, a condom, and that
this made the prosecutor’s submission improper. I reject this submission.
The prosecutor was obliged
to put the Crown case, which was that the applicant
told JK that he was using “protection” (that is, he wore a condom
when having sexual intercourse with the complainant), which corroborated the
complainant’s evidence that the applicant in fact
wore a condom when he
had sexual intercourse with her. No impropriety on the part of the prosecutor
has been demonstrated.
The prosecutor’s submission that the
complainant was not “recruiting” support for her reporting
prosecutor submitted:
Now, for someone who was eager to recruit people, the fact that she called
police initially and basically said [the complainant’s
first name] and
didn’t tell what her father’s name was, that in and of itself, blows
it out of the water, the sense that
she was recruiting. And sure, she asked
Detective Senior Constable Nacsom, “what sentence he might get.”
Well, as he[r]
Honour said, that is your determination, she can’t really
put the cart before the horse. But that doesn’t go to her vindictiveness,
again, that’s just typical of [the complainant] wanting to research, like
she researched the psychologist, she wanted to be
It makes sense that you’re about to go with your partner to Canada for a
working holiday and a holiday, what are you going
to do? There’s this
thing you’ve actually made a decision now, you’re unsure, now
you’re sure, you’ve
told your friends, there’s nothing wrong
with that. ... So, she’s asked [do] you [want] them to keep a record of

some time about what you had told them, if it came to
applicant’s disagreement with the Crown’s submission that the
complainant was not “recruiting” complaint
witnesses does not make
the prosecutor’s submission improper. The remaining passages relied on by
the applicant fall into the
same category and do not need to be replicated.
the reasons given above, ground 4C has not been made out. Leave ought be
Alleged improper conduct by prosecutor in his address
concerning Dr Pulman’s report (ground 4A)
grounds germane to Dr Pulman’s report have been addressed above. Ground 4A
relates to the prosecutor’s conduct with
respect to Dr Pulman’s
report. The applicant alleged that the prosecutor breached Barristers Rules, r
86, which provides that
“[a] prosecutor must not argue any proposition of
fact or law which the prosecutor does not believe on reasonable grounds to
capable of contributing to a finding of guilt and also to carry
submissions made by the prosecutor in his closing address about Dr
Pulman’s evidence are contained in the narrative of the
trial set out
evidence of Dr Pulman was an important part of the Crown case. Her evidence
served to explain many aspects of the complainant’s
evidence which the
jury might otherwise have found perplexing or counter-intuitive (including why
she remained living with the applicant;
why she did not complain until many
years later; why she was apparently able to function so well in other areas of
her life when
she was the victim of weekly sexual intercourse with her father;
and why she succumbed to it after her initial resistance failed
to elicit the
support of her mother). The prosecutor was entitled, and, indeed, obliged to put
the Crown case to persuade the jury
to exclude any hypothesis consistent with
innocence. I am not persuaded that the prosecutor overstepped the proper bounds
role or that there was any arguable breach of Barristers Rules,
r 86. Ground 4A has not been made out.
Alleged false
representation by the prosecutor about the Hite Report (ground 11C)
applicant submitted that the prosecutor had misstated the evidence when he
referred to the
Hite Report
as “a survey about a number of women
and how they’ve failed to achieve orgasm”. The applicant argued that
mischaracterised the
Hite Report
which he described in his
submissions as a “comprehensive survey of many aspects of female sexuality
[which] even has a chapter
on feminism.” The applicant submitted that it
was “unfair and wrong” for the prosecutor to describe it in the
set out above.
Hite Report
was not before the jury. What was before the jury was
uncontroverted evidence that the applicant had given a copy of the
to the complainant. It was the Crown case that this conduct was part
of his attempt to groom the complainant and indicated his sexual
interest in
her; it was the defence case that this conduct was an attempt by the applicant
to give her sex education as his wife
was unwilling to do so. In these
circumstances, the jury would have understood the reference in the
prosecutor’s address to
Hite Report
as a reference to what
the complainant
took from reading it, about which she gave evidence,
rather than as a comprehensive summary of what was contained in the report.
applicant, through his counsel, took no exception to this aspect of the
prosecutor’s address. It was not improper of the
prosecutor to refer to
the complainant’s evidence in these terms in the closing address. Leave
should be refused in respect
of ground 11C.
Alleged inflammatory
comments made by the prosecutor in his closing address (ground 4I)
applicant submitted that two passages from the prosecutor’s closing
submissions were “inflammatory” and, accordingly,
improper, each of
which is highlighted in the passage below:
The accused conduct of normalising the sexual abuse also incorporated coercive
conduct. That started in Melbourne when, as she put
it, she’d be expected
to be there as it was happening. In her own words, ... “And my father,
like, the room was always
really hot and my father would like, pressure me to
undress or at least just down to my underwear.” Don’t divorce all
these allegations from the family. Now, whilst I tell you come, or the Crown
says that you should come to it with your life experience.
Try and think about
this particular family.
This was a family that didn’t even eat together
but they massaged naked together.
So, you need to think about something
that, maybe is unconventional to use the accuse[d’s] words where basically
this was occurring.
Hallmarks of [the complainant]’s evidence being honest. I refer to it
briefly in my introduction. “When he would turn
to you, you said he would
smile, I mean, what was, how would he smile?” answer “kind of like
he was teasing me or making
a joke or maybe it was like a joke that we were both
in on.” “When he asked you if you felt warm and fuzzy down there
you know what he meant?” answer “yes.” “How did you know
what he meant?” “because I did feel
something down there.”
This has multiple purposes. It’s an example of her starting to be
sexualised because she’s been exposed to her naked
parents massaging each
other, herself being naked watching it. So, that’s one aspect. The other
aspect is, she’s offering
you something which is counter-intuitive.
She’s actually effectively telling you as a child, a pre-teen, she is
being aroused by being in that very space watching whatever’s
on TV and or
watching her parents
(Emphasis added to indicate the passages which the applicant submitted were
inflammatory.)
applicant did not submit that the first highlighted portion did not accord with
the evidence. Rather, he submitted that the prosecutor
had failed to give the
“whole picture” of their family life.
r 83 of the Barristers Rules, requires a prosecutor to “seek impartially
to have the whole of the relevant evidence placed
intelligibly before the
court”, it does not follow that the prosecutor is not required to put the
Crown case. While an accused
is entitled to a fair trial, the prosecutor does
not represent the accused and is obliged to put the Crown case in the context of
an adversarial system. There was no obligation on the Crown to refer to
circumstances which might have put the applicant in a better
light (that he was
an orphan, that his wife was sick and not an active parent, that he was,
effectively, a sole parent whose only
daughter achieved academic excellence). I
do not accept that the submission highlighted above was unwarranted, much less
inflammatory.
to the applicant’s submission, the second statement which the applicant
relied on as being inflammatory also accorded
with the complainant’s
evidence. I reject the submission that it was inflammatory: it fairly stated the
evidence which the
complainant had given.
4I has not been made out. I would refuse leave.
misrepresentation of evidence by the prosecutor in the Crown closing address
(ground 11E)
applicant has listed several instances on which he alleged that the prosecutor
misstated the evidence. On each occasion, there
was a basis in the evidence for
the prosecutor’s submission. The applicant has sought to argue the merits
of his case under
the guise of criticism of the prosecutor’s closing. It
is not necessary to detail each of the instances relied upon since they
a misapprehension which is common to them all.
single example is sufficient to illustrate the point. The prosecutor said, in
Even in [the complainant’s] evidence about how she spoke to Detective
Lavington, it was a long and convoluted process with
many breaks because she got
emotional. This is how it flowed.
applicant submitted that the prosecutor misstated the evidence. He claimed in
his written submissions on the appeal that he had
listened to the
claimant’s recorded interview with Detective Lavington and recalled that
the complainant was “very business-like
and not emotional at all”.
complainant gave evidence of the number of statements she had made to the police
(a process which could fairly be described as
convoluted”). Detective Lavington gave the following evidence of the first
Q. When she was providing this information to you, was there anything to do with
her demeanour that slowed things down?
A From memory she was quite emotional. But it - there was a lot of information
to provide. So - and these types of matters do take
time, in my experience.
the extent to which the prosecutor added a rhetorical flourish to this evidence
by using the words “long and convoluted”,
this was neither
inflammatory nor outside proper bounds. Further, it is telling that defence
counsel, of his own initiative or on
the instructions of the applicant, did not
seek to have the prosecutor’s closing statement withdrawn or
The challenge to the conduct of defence counsel
applicant’s submissions were redolent with complaints about defence
counsel, many of which have already been addressed in
connection with ground 2.
However, the focus of his submissions in support of the contention that defence
counsel was incompetent
were the following:
(1) alleged failure to ask “obvious” questions which were damaging
to the prosecution;
(2) alleged failure to expose the real reason why the complainant consulted a
psychologist;
(3) alleged failure to confront the complainant with lies;
(4) alleged failure to object to inadmissible evidence (which are the subject of
separate grounds); and
(5) alleged failure to object to the prosecutor’s conduct or the trial
judge’s conduct (which are the subject of separate
sub-grounds (4) and (5) above have been addressed elsewhere under separate
grounds, it is unnecessary to address them further.
Sub-grounds
(1) to (3) turn on forensic decisions made by defence counsel in conducting the
defence of the applicant. These matters
were matters of discretion for defence
counsel, who was obliged by Barristers Rules, r 42
to act as the
mouthpiece of his client. He was required to exercise independent judgment and
was entitled to act contrary to his client’s
instructions within the area
of forensic discretion (see the authorities referred to above, including the
to sub-ground (1), the applicant submitted that defence counsel was incompetent
for not putting to the complainant that if she
was the victim of weekly sexual
abuse, she would not have stayed at home with her father. The course desired by
the applicant was
fraught with forensic risk, including the risk that the jury
would regard the defence case as being based on one of the misconceptions
exposed by Dr Pulman: why do child victims of sexual abuse remain within the
family home? Dr Pulman explained in her evidence the
manifold reasons why that
would be the case. In my view, it was objectively forensically reasonable for
defence counsel not to ask
the questions which the applicant wanted to be asked
to that effect.
to sub-ground (2), the applicant complained that his counsel did not explore
with the complainant or her then boyfriend, Mr T,
the “real reason”
why she went to a psychologist, which he said was depression. The basis for this
causal conclusion
was the handwritten note which the complainant wrote to JK
(addressed above with respect to ground 2). This forensic course was also
fraught with risk because it could reasonably have been anticipated that the
jury, if they accepted the complainant’s evidence,
would regard the
complainant’s depression as having been caused, or at least contributed to
by, the complainant’s incestuous
relationship with her father. It was
objectively reasonable for defence counsel to refrain from this forensic
to sub-ground (3), the applicant complained that his counsel did not
cross-examine the complainant about her “lies”
the meeting she had with DM (a complaint witness), which she said was on Boxing
Day. The applicant’s submission
reveal that he worked out a series of
propositions about timing in 2016 to 2017 which he wanted his counsel to put to
the complainant
as lies and explain to the jury with a view to discrediting the
complainant. As the applicant put it: he asked his counsel to “explain
this to the jury but he did not”. It was forensically reasonable for
defence counsel not to cross-examine the complainant
along those lines. The
prospect of such questioning being productive or causing any doubt as to the
complainant’s credibility
when it came to the charge period was too remote
to warrant the course being taken.
these reasons, ground 1 has not been made out. I would refuse
Grounds challenging the conduct of the trial judge
Allegation that the trial judge was biased against the applicant and that
this caused a miscarriage of justice (ground 9)
applicant submitted that the following matters revealed that the trial judge was
biased against him:
(1) the exclusion of the evidence of the complainant’s school records;
(2) the trial judge intervened when the applicant was giving evidence but did
not intervene in the same way when the complainant
and JK were giving
(3) the trial judge misrepresented the defence case in the summing up;
(4) inaccuracies in the trial transcript imply judicial interference; and
(5) the sentence was manifestly excessive.
note that each of (1)-(4) is separately raised as grounds of appeal against
conviction and (5) is raised as a ground of appeal against
first objection to ground 9 is that, except with respect to (5) above, the
applicant is taken to have waived any objection to
the matters raised since he
was legally represented and did not make any objection on the grounds of bias:

this statement refers to civil proceedings, the principle is not so

to (4), significant time was taken, as the transcript revealed, to correct the
transcript following consultation with counsel.
For example, all references to
“swinging club” were changed to “swimming club” and
references to “compliant
witnesses” were changed to “complaint
witnesses”. The applicant’s counsel had access to the transcript
as the transcript reveals, checked it and drew the trial judge’s
attention to corrections which needed to be made. The applicant,
through his
counsel, had the same opportunity. While it is difficult, if not impossible, to
ensure that a transcript is completely
free of error before it goes to the jury,
the transcript reveals that attempts were made, through regular consultation
with counsel,
to provide the best possible transcript to the jury. Further,
there was an added safeguard provided by the trial judge’s direction
the summing up about the use which could be made of the transcript, the
possibility of errors and that the evidence was what they
had heard, not what
was written in the transcript (extracted above).
than taking any objection to the trial judge’s conduct (described in
(1)-(4) above) at the time, the applicant stood
by to see whether he would be
convicted by the jury. This amounts to a waiver because the applicant elected to
allow the matter to
be determined by the jury. Although the applicant cannot
have been taken to know of the sentence that would be imposed by the trial
in advance of its being imposed, lack of success in proceedings is not an
indication of bias. As noted, there is a separate
ground of manifest excess on
the sentence appeal.
note for completeness that, even aside from waiver, none of the arguments raised
supports a finding that there was either actual
bias an apprehension of bias on
the part of the trial judge.
Accordingly,
leave to appeal ought not be granted with respect to ground
Alleged misrepresentations in the summing up
Alleged misrepresentation regarding improper touching during massages
(ground 11B)
complainant said in paragraph 101 of her police statement dated 13 July 2018
that during naked massages which occurred after the
sexual intercourse stopped
and continued until she moved out, the applicant would “graze the outer
lips of [her] vagina”.
The statement was tendered on the
relating to tendency evidence.
the detail quoted above was not given by the complainant in her oral evidence at
trial and was therefore not before the jury,
although the complainant gave
evidence that the naked massages continued. She also said that she moved to
Adelaide, in part, to avoid
the massages to which she would have been subjected
had she stayed in Sydney.
her summing up, the trial judge said, with respect to the massages:
“[they] would involve, [the complainant] said, the accused
brushing her
... vaginal area” and, as set out above, repeated this detail twice in her
summary of the Crown case.
the complainant did not refer to the applicant brushing her vaginal area in the
massages in her evidence, the trial judge misstated
the evidence and the summing
up was erroneous to that extent.
have an obligation to listen carefully to the summing up and correct any
inaccuracies which they discern in the course of
it so that the trial judge can
correct them in front of the jury. The error referred to above was not corrected
by counsel (or by
the applicant himself through his counsel). The trial judge
told the jury that she would not be referring to all of the evidence;
the jury should bear in mind what counsel said in addresses, but that they were
obliged to decide all relevant issues of
fact by reference to the evidence:
being what was said by the witnesses and what is in the exhibits. A transcript
of the evidence
(but not the summing up and therefore not the misstatement and
not counsel’s addresses) was provided to the jury. The jury
consider its verdict on a Friday morning and returned its verdict of guilty on
the following Wednesday.
is significant that the applicant, who was in the dock throughout the summing
up, did not, apparently notice the error and draw
it to the attention of his
counsel. The error was so minor that it was, in my view, incapable of causing a
miscarriage of justice.
I would refuse leave to appeal with respect to
ground 11B.
Alleged misrepresentation about the Hite Report
(ground 11D)
set out above, the trial judge referred in the summing to the
complainant’s evidence about being given the
Hite Report
applicant. Her Honour said,
He would also tell her he was educating her, teaching her for own good, showing
her the Hite Report, which is a survey about a number
of women and how they
failed to achieve orgasm.
the reasons given above, it must have been plain (to the jury) that the
description of the
Hite Report
was the complainant’s own
description about what she had taken from the
Hite Report
, rather than a
comprehensive survey of the report itself. The trial judge, in her summary of
the Crown case, was entitled to use
the words which the prosecutor had used,
which were, in any event, derived from the complainant’s evidence. Leave
refused with respect to ground.

Cross-examination of sexual assault complainants often proceeds as if the
reliability of their evidence about the assault can in
some way be shaken by a
failure to be precise about surrounding tangential detail. This approach is, in
my opinion, rarely appropriate.
Memory of surrounding detail has few if any
implications, in my opinion, for a person’s reliability about the central
of a traumatic event. The psychological assumptions that appear to
underlie much cross-examination have no scientific basis and,
indeed, are
contrary to what we do know about human memory. ...
member of the Court must carry out an independent assessment of the evidence:
Consideration
applicant argued that there was no reliable evidence against him because the
complainant was not reliable and she was motivated
to “frame” him
because she had conspired with a friend, DM (one of the complaint witnesses) to
do so. He submitted that
her scholastic achievements were “highly
inconsistent with the accusations”. He submitted that it was implausible
the alleged sexual conduct had taken place over such a long period,
particularly in circumstances where, as far as outward appearance
complainant was happy, well-adjusted and successful. He contended that Dr
Pulman’s evidence did not serve to explain
“why two adult women [the
complainant and JK] could not stop the abuse allegedly perpetrated by a
soft-spoken, physically non-violent
man in 2013 and after, and why both of them
stayed in his place much longer than necessary, while one of them was being
abused and another one scared ...”.
submitted that, although the family had moved to Sydney from Melbourne, the
complainant was still in touch with her friends in
Melbourne and was, therefore,
not isolated. He said that the nude massages between him and JK had commenced
before the complainant
was born because of their therapeutic value. He argued
that the complainant could not explain how it happened that she came to his
bedroom at 5.30pm on Saturdays and that, if it were true that he was molesting
her, she would not have come there for a naked massage.
He also submitted that
both the complainant and JK had lied about the complainant feeling (from the
complainant’s point of
view) and looking (from JK’s point of view)
“embarrassed” when she emerged, half-dressed, carrying her clothes
after the weekly session with the applicant in his bedroom. He submitted that
“if [the complainant] had anything to be embarrassed
fully dressed before leaving the bedroom.” That she did not, the applicant
submitted, “proves that
there was nothing shameful happening.”
applicant relied on the fact that the complainant continued to live with him
after her mother left as strong evidence disproving
her version. He submitted
that the complainant “end[ed] up voluntarily staying with her
‘abuser’ until she [was]
24 and [left] because she absolutely [had]
to, because she found a job in another city.” He submitted that there was
“absolutely
no chance of [the complainant] as [an] adolescent willingly
participating in something sexual, dirty and illegal.” He submitted
her scholastic achievements showed that “she was stress free at
applicant also relied on the delay of about 10 years in disclosing the alleged
applicant contended that he was “the opposite of a typical abusive
father” and had made many sacrifices for his family.
applicant submitted that “the defence version” was “consistent
with all the evidence, ... simpler than the Crown’s
version and fits the
evidence much better ...”. He imputed nefarious motives to the complainant
(that she was shocked at how
difficult it was to support herself financially and
realised that she could make a financial claim against him) and JK (that she
bitter after the separation).
my view, it was open to the jury to accept the complainant’s evidence as
to the elements of the offence and the surrounding
circumstances, including the
And so when my father ignored me or iced me out, it felt, like, I was throwing
away what was supposed to be one of the most meaningful
relationships in my life
and that hurt a lot. And so the reason I’d given in was that the, like,
hour and a half that the abuse
and the massages took every week just seemed,
like, a small price to pay for the rest of the week him being, like, engaged
- in completely normal senses of the word - like, loving and
affectionate and just, like, a good dad.
delay in complaint was not unusual for such a case and was amply explained by
the complainant and by the expert opinion evidence
of Dr Pulman. The
complainant’s evidence was corroborated by JK to a substantial extent. It
was open to the jury to accept
that JK, being unwilling to submit to sexual
intercourse with the applicant (because of her illness, lack of energy, conflict
the marriage or some other reason), was complicit in the sexualisation by
the applicant of the complainant, which culminated in the
acts of sexual
intercourse in his bedroom throughout the charged period. It was also open to
the jury to reason that it was only
when the complainant could establish a
stable existence in Adelaide, far from the applicant, that she felt sufficiently
tell her closest friends and, ultimately, to report the matter to the
was also open to the jury to accept that the outwardly successful face which the
complainant presented to the world (including
through her achievements at
school, university and debating) were not inconsistent with the fact of the
abuse and stemmed from embarrassment,
shame, fear and a desire to hide the fact
of the abuse.
consider that it was amply open to the jury to consider, in accordance with the
direction that the applicant’s denials of the offending
conduct could not possibly be true and, accordingly, to put his evidence
side, except in so far as it corroborated the complainant’s evidence (as
to the weekly naked massages within the locked
perimeter of his bedroom).
of the arguments raised by the applicant on his own behalf (or, indeed, those of
defence counsel at trial) causes me to doubt
the applicant’s guilt of the
offences charged. I have reviewed all of the evidence in the trial (the most
significant aspects
of which I have summarised above) and am not persuaded that
the verdict is unreasonable.
Accordingly,

sentencing proceedings
proceedings on sentence were adjourned from 6 May 2022 to 22 July 2022 because
the applicant had changed legal representatives.
On that occasion, the
applicant’s counsel said on the question of whether the offence was
aggravated by the substantial harm
suffered by the complainant:
... you won’t hear from me that there is not as a result of the fact that
he was her father for want of better words, substantial
this apparent concession, the prosecution agreed that it would not rely on the
aggravating factor of
s 21A(2)(g)
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure)
(NSW) because it accepted that such harm was inherent in the
offence charged. The Crown relied, among other factors on the aggravating
s 21A(2)(k)
that the applicant abused his position of trust and authority in
relation to the victim. Accordingly, the sentence hearing proceeded
on the basis
that the harm suffered by the complainant was not substantial so as to aggravate
the offence under
s 21A(2)(g)
because of the harm inherent in such an
offence. This matter is the subject of challenge in ground 3.
applicant’s counsel accepted that the applicant being the
complainant’s father significantly aggravated the offence.

Crown tendered the applicant’s criminal record to establish that he had no
prior convictions.
applicant read an affidavit which he had sworn, in which he deposed to his being
an orphan and the progress of his life and work
which brought him from Russia to
Australia. In his affidavit, he did not address the offending conduct. His
counsel informed the
Court that the applicant maintained his innocence of the
hearing the parties’ submissions, the trial judge said:
The way in which the evidence was given was reasonably polar or polarised in
that the complainant gave evidence of all of the unlawful
sexual acts. The
offender gave evidence that none of them occurred. The way in which the evidence
was given did not give rise to
any impression that there is course to
differentiate between the strength of acceptance by the jury of a minimum of two
acts. Perhaps better expressed what I’m saying is that I
can’t see as the sentencing judge that there is any proper basis
to differentiate between the finding in respect of any of those unlawful sexual
acts. The verdict of the jury necessarily
indicates that the jury accepted the
credibility of the complainant. But the detail of the evidence in my view, does
not allow me
to differentiate in the strength of evidence between the different
unlawful acts.
Crown agreed with what her Honour had put. The applicant’s counsel also
agreed and responded:
Your Honour my position is quite simple and unequivocal. Having read all the
material and noting what your Honour properly describes
it as two polarising
positions and a verdict, the law says one thing in terms of a minimum number but
I cannot put to your Honour
a basis upon which any of the discreet nine can be
separated other than the act of cunnilingus [this was particular 9 on the
indictment-
see above].
trial judge also raised with the parties the effect of s 61AE(8), which requires
the judge to take into account the maximum penalty
for the unlawful sexual acts
engaged in by the accused during the period in which the unlawful sexual
relationship existed.
Honour confirmed with the parties that the evidence established that there was a
period of about two or three months in total
in the 16-month period of offending
when weekly sexual intercourse (and associated acts as particularised in the
indictment other
than cunnilingus, which occurred only once) took place.
Crown confirmed that it relied on the conduct before the commencement of the
charge period as “grooming”, which could
be taken into account on
objective seriousness and moral culpability but submitted that the conduct after
the charge period was only
relevant as tendency evidence which, if accepted,
made it more likely that the offending (during the charge period) occurred. He
submitted that the post-offence conduct was also relevant to show that the
offender did not voluntarily desist from engaging in the
conduct after the
complainant turned 16 which meant that no submission to that effect in
mitigation could be put.
applicant’s counsel submitted:
... the actual physical acts unlawful as they were ..., in terms of them being
sexual acts are the more routine ordinary if one can
say that and would say that
if it wasn’t for the age of [the complainant] they’re more in the
very ordinary range of
activity, they are not the more outrageous acts that
courts see from time to time and are reflected in various authorities ...
These are more at the ordinary level. ...
Crown responded to this submission by saying:
In many respects I hear what my learned friend says and in many respects there
is a flipside to what my friend has said that in fact
the way in which the
conduct occurred makes the offending more serious. Certainly as your Honour has

compelling impact statement which underpinned the way in which this offence
It was having a mother who was clearly highly dysfunctional, someone
who was unable to protect their own daughter, who gave permission
to her husband
to teach [the complainant] about sexual matters and then it was the father who
then over a course of period of time
groomed her into thinking what happened was
normal. The Crown would say that there is nothing ordinary about that. And of
there is always much worse case scenarios but we’re not here for
What the Crown would say is that it is toward the upper end of the scale of
objective seriousness because what the offender did was
use psychological
manipulation with the mother and with the daughter.
(Emphasis added to indicate the passage which forms part of grounds 7 and 8.)
The sentencing judgment
applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 years with a non-parole
period of 11 years. The sentence was backdated
to commence on 23 February 2022,
when the jury returned its verdict and the applicant went into custody as a
result of a successful
detention application by the Crown.
trial judge’s factual findings on sentence reflected an acceptance of the
complainant’s evidence (which the jury can
be taken to have accepted with
respect to the elements of the offence when returning its verdict).
key factual findings included that each of the eight particulars (set out in the
indictment, extracted above) was established.
The trial judge found that the
sexual offending occurred on a weekly basis at 5.30pm and that, once the
penile-vaginal intercourse
commenced around February 2007, it continued for the
charge period as part of the weekly routine until the complainant’s 16th
birthday in the middle of May 2008 which amounted to a period of approximately
one year and three months. Her Honour found that ejaculation
would occur, and
that the applicant wore a condom. Her Honour also found that the sexual activity
continued after the complainant’s
16th birthday (after the expiry of the
charge period).
Honour expressly made no finding of substantial harm under
s 21A(2)(g)
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
although she acknowledged that the harm
to the victim was “enormous”. Her Honour referred to authority,
including the
following statement from
[2014] NSWCCA 56
239 A Crim R 469
, in which this Court said at [10]:
This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious
effects upon victims for many years, if not their whole
lives. Sexual abuse of
children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage.
trial judge also referred to
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure)
, which provides:
When sentencing an offender for a child sexual offence, a Court must have regard
to the trauma of sexual abuse on children as understood
at the time of
sentencing, which may include recent psychological research
or the common
experience of the courts
(Emphasis added to indicate the source of the objection taken by the applicant
in ground 5).
Honour considered the various factors which were relevant to her Honour’s
assessment of the gravity of the offence as follows:
(1) the age of the complainant at the time of the offending (which was “in
the upper range for this offence”);
(2) the age of the offender at the time of the offending, 41-43 years old, which
did not aggravate the offence since it was inherent
in the fact that he is the
complainant’s father;
(3) the length of time over which the unlawful sexual relationship was
maintained (16½ months);
(4) the frequency with which the unlawful sexual acts occurred: eight of the
nine particulars in the indictment (see above) were
repeated weekly but the
ninth (cunnilingus) happened only once; this continued for a total of 13½
to 14½ months out of
the charge period, which rendered the offence
“particularly serious”;
(5) the duration of each episode, which was 60-90 minutes, which included 30
minutes of naked massage (which was found to elevate
the seriousness of the
(6) the type of unlawful sexual acts (the acts of penile-vaginal intercourse
were found to have had the strongest impact on sexualising
the complainant and
adding to the seriousness of the offence);
(7) whether violence or coercion was used or pain was caused (her Honour found
that although physical violence was not used, psychological
manipulation was
used and the applicant also used pornography to sexualise the complainant
prematurely);
(8) the offences occurred in the home of the victim (the trial judge considered
this to overlap with the breach of trust occasioned
by the circumstance that the
applicant was the complainant’s father and therefore did not give it
“much significance”;
(9) breach of trust (the trial judge found that a “gross breach of
trust” aggravated the offence).
trial judge said that “this case represents a serious example of this type
of offence” and assessed the objective
seriousness of the offence to be
“above the mid-range of gravity to a significant extent”.
Honour found that there was no factor that mitigated the applicant’s moral
culpability.
addressing the subjective circumstances, her Honour found that the
applicant’s subjective case was limited. He was not remorseful.
good character, but the weight afforded to that factor was limited, given the
period of the offending and the frequency
of unlawful acts within that period.
The trial judge assessed the applicant’s risk of recidivism to be low. Her
Honour made
a finding of special circumstances and adjusted the ratio between
the non-parole period and the total term from the statutory ratio
The proposed grounds
grounds include criticisms of counsel who appeared for the applicant at the
sentence hearing (grounds 1, 3 and 6); of the prosecutor
(grounds 7 and 8); of
the trial judge (grounds 2 and 5) and of the sentence itself (ground 4). I will
address the grounds concerning
counsel first (together with ground 2, which is
related to ground 1), then the grounds concerning the trial judge and, finally,
manifest excess ground.
Allegation that the applicant was not
given sufficient time to prepare for the sentence (ground 3)
applicant submitted that the prosecution only served the victim impact statement
the day before sentencing which meant that, if
the sentencing proceedings had
been adjourned to prepare a response, it would have resulted in more time in
gaol before the applicant
could file his appeal. He submitted that his counsel
did not give him the choice.
appeal against conviction must be filed within 3 months of conviction or within
the period of a notice of intention to appeal.
Accordingly, it can be lodged
before the imposition of sentence. Further, the applicant is bound by the
conduct of his counsel in
not seeking a further adjournment. In addition, it is
difficult to see what difference any adjournment would have made in
circumstances
where the Crown accepted (as outlined above) that it could not
rely on the aggravating factor of “substantial harm” under
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
since this was
inherent in the offence. Further, the aggravating factor of breach of trust and
breach of authority was inevitably
present given that the applicant is the
complainant’s natural father and they lived in the same household. This
amply established, leaving aside the victim impact statement.
victim impact statement must be considered by the sentencing judge before the
imposition of sentence:
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure)
. There are considerable restrictions on the provision of access to
victim impact statements prior to the sentence hearing:
(Sentencing Procedure) Act
3 has not been made out.
Allegation that defence counsel did not
object to the victim impact statement (ground 6)
applicant referred to his challenges to the complainant’s credit made in
ground 1 of the conviction appeal. He also submitted,
in support of ground 6 of
the sentence appeal:
Notwithstanding what the complainant stated in her [victim impact statement],
the complainant admitted that the damage to her was
minimal (Attachment A [to
his affidavit of 17 January 2025, considered above under ground 2]). And she
lied about her symptoms.
applicant relied on the apparent concession made by defence counsel (extracted
above) that the offence was aggravated by the substantial
harm suffered by the
complainant. For the reasons given above, this concession was implicitly
withdrawn by defence counsel and was
not, in any event, accepted by the trial
trial judge did not find that the offending was aggravated as her Honour did not
find that the complainant suffered substantial
harm (the type of harm suffered
by the victim being inherent in the offence itself). There was no proper basis
on which the applicant’s
counsel could have objected to the
complainant’s victim impact statement since it did not go beyond proper
bounds set out in
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
indeed, addressed the specific matters raised in that section. It fulfilled the
purpose envisaged by Division 2 of Part 3 of
6 has not been made out.
Allegation that the trial judge
improperly based that sentence on the frequency and number of illegal acts and
that the defence counsel’s
incompetence contributed to this error (grounds
applicant submitted that the trial judge was in error in basing the sentence on
the frequency and number of illegal acts and that
his counsel did not object to
this course when it became obvious in the course of the sentencing hearing (as
set out above) that
the trial judge was proposing to do so (and the basis on
which her Honour was proposing to assess that frequency and number by reference
to the complainant’s evidence).
applicant repeated the argument put in support of ground 12 (the challenge to
the constitutionality of s 66EA) that he could not
be punished for any acts of
which he had not been charged. I reject this argument for the reasons given with
respect to ground 12.
applicant also argued that her Honour was not entitled to sentence him on the
basis that the jury had accepted the complainant’s
evidence in its
entirety for the following reasons:
(1) the jury could have convicted him of the offence charged even if had they
not been satisfied that there was any penetration;
(2) juries are directed that they can accept some part of a witness’
evidence and reject other parts (from which he said that
it followed that it
cannot be assumed that the jury accepted that he had penetrated the
complainant); and
(3) the number and frequency of sexual acts were not addressed at trial because
they were not part of the charges.
to (1), this is theoretically possible. However, once the jury had convicted the
applicant of the offence, it was for the trial
judge to find the facts on
sentence: see
, discussed above. It was open to
her Honour to accept the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt on
the number and
frequency of the sexual acts for the purposes of sentencing.
to (2), the process of sentencing is not to determine what the jury might have
thought of particular evidence. Rather, once the
jury has returned a verdict of
guilty, it is for the trial judge, as set out above, to find the facts: see the
discussion of
to (3), the number and frequency of the unlawful acts were the subject of
substantial evidence at the trial, as detailed in the
narrative of the evidence
above and as found by her Honour in the sentencing judgment.
my view, the criticisms of the applicant’s counsel on sentence are
unwarranted, having regard to the evidence at trial, the
jury’s verdict
and the applicable law.
ground 1, nor ground 2 has been made out.
Alleged failure by the
trial judge to take into account the circumstances of the particular case
applicant submitted that her Honour relied on the “typical experience of
courts” and said:
Arguably, if this case were a typical experience, the law would not be nearly as
severe, if we had it at all. One has an illegal
relationship with a child, and
the child is happy, healthy and successful? Why would the society want to
prosecute that?
trial judge was obliged to take into account, pursuant to
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
, “the trauma of sexual abuse on
children as understood at the time of sentencing, which may include ... the
common experience
of courts”. Her Honour’s reasons indicated that
she had done just that. Further, this matter was to the applicant’s
advantage. Since it is the court’s experience that the harm caused by such
offences is almost inevitably very serious, such
harm is inherent in the
offence. Thus, even the harm suffered by the complainant in the present case was
found not to qualify as
an aggravating factor under
s 21A(2)(g)
(Sentencing Procedure) Act
. Ground 5 has not been made
Alleged improper conduct by the prosecutor (grounds 7 and
these grounds, the applicant repeated the submissions he made in support of
those grounds of his appeal against conviction which
were based on alleged
misconduct or impropriety of the prosecutor at trial. It is not necessary to
address them further since they
have been addressed (and rejected) above.
only additional matter which the applicant raised which arose in the sentence
hearing was that set out in the extract above where
the prosecutor was
responding to the submission by defence counsel that the sexual activity was
“routine” and “ordinary”.
I discern no impropriety in
the submission which was made by the prosecutor in this context. It was open to
the Crown to submit that
the iterative process of grooming and psychological
manipulation over an extended period was more serious than an impulsive act

support of his submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive, the
applicant submitted orally:
The sentence breaches at least two principles.
First, that it shouldn’t be crushing, because it is crushing to me.
Basically all my remaining of my active years I will have
to spend in gaol and
after that I will not be able to travel. I will be on parole in the best case.
So basically I have nothing to look forward, I have nothing to live for. And the
second principle that it shouldn’t punish
for outcomes that could not be
foreseen. I think from the trial, it is clear that I cared a lot about my
daughter. I have done a
lot for her. In particular, I stayed with her very
difficult mother that needed constant support and I did it for my daughter. And
there is no way that I would have done anything that was damaging to her. And
even if I did, I would not possibly expect the outcomes.
also submitted that it was wrong for the maximum penalty for this offence to be
the same as for murder, namely, life imprisonment,
since there could be no
greater damage than murder.
excess is a conclusion:
Dinsdale v The Queen
(2000) 202 CLR 321
. The relevant principles were summarised by this Court in
[2018] NSWCCA 2
(Payne JA, R A Hulme and Garling JJ)
as follows:
When it is contended that a sentence is manifestly excessive it is necessary to
have regard to the following principles ...:
(1) appellate intervention is not justified simply because the
result arrived at in the court below is markedly different from
imposed in other cases;
(2) intervention is only warranted where the difference is such
that it may be concluded that there must have been some misapplication
principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the reasons of the
sentencing judge, or where the sentence imposed is
so far outside the range of
sentences available that there must have been error;
(3) it is not to the point that this Court might have exercised
the sentencing discretion differently;
(4) there is no single correct sentence and judges at first
instance are allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant
consistency of approach and application of principle; and
(5) it is for the applicant to establish that the sentence was
unreasonable or plainly unjust.
(Authorities omitted.)
maximum penalty for an offence under s 66EA is life imprisonment. The offence
and the maximum penalty apply retrospectively:
at [11], [21],
[25]-[28] (Gageler CJ and Jagot J) and [65] (Gordon, Steward and Gleeson JJ).
The maximum penalty is an important guidepost
for the purposes of sentencing and
is generally regarded as an indication of the seriousness with which the
legislature regards the
Muldrock v The Queen
(2011) 244 CLR 120
[2011] HCA 39
) at [27]. I note that the maximum penalty for
murder (referred to by the applicant) is also life imprisonment.
answer to the specific submissions made by the applicant about the effect on his
life of the sentence which has been imposed, it
is important to note the various
purposes of sentencing, which are set out in
Crimes (Sentencing
Procedure) Act
. These are, in substance: punishment, deterrence (general and
specific), protection of the community, rehabilitation of the offender;
the offender accountable for his actions; denunciating the conduct and
recognising the harm done to the victim and to the
community. In the present
case, where the risk of the applicant re-offending was not regarded as high, the
purposes of punishment,
general deterrence, making the applicant accountable,
denunciating the conduct and recognising the harm to the victim are particularly
significant.
non-parole period is required to be specified because justice requires that the
offender serve that period in custody:
at [57]. It is the
minimum period of time in gaol having regard to all the relevant matters
including the objective seriousness of
Power v The Queen
[1974] HCA 26
(1974) 131 CLR 623
at 628–629;

; referred to in
Queen; Jones v The Queen

(reflecting the finding of special circumstances).
crime for which the applicant was to be sentenced was, as her Honour found,
objectively very serious and “above the mid-range
of gravity to a
significant extent”. His moral culpability, particularly as the
complainant’s father, was very high.
His conduct was egregious,
manipulative and calculated. The complainant was extremely vulnerable, having
regard to her age at the
time the grooming commenced; her distance from her
close friends in Melbourne following the family’s move to Sydney; her
as an only child with a mother who was, for various reasons, incapable
of protecting her and, indeed, was complicit in the applicant’s
her shame at what was occurring; and her psychological need for her
father’s love and approval. The consequences for
the complainant will be
lifelong. She has been robbed of her innocence, her adolescence and her ability
to enjoy intimate relations
without trauma. Her once promising trajectory has
been blunted and thwarted by the applicant’s criminality. As her Honour
there is little to be said for the applicant by way of mitigation,
other than that he was otherwise of good character and had no
is not necessary to address the “comparative” cases referred to by
all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was not open
to the trial judge.
Leave to appeal on sentence
am disposed to grant leave to appeal on ground 4 (the manifest excess ground)
but not otherwise.
Release application
applicant made a release application which was listed to be heard together with
his appeal and applications for leave to appeal.
He had previously applied for
bail from this Court. His application was dismissed on 27 August 2025:
[2025] NSWCCA 138 (Hamill
J, Harrison CJ at CL and Sweeney J agreeing) on
the basis that he had failed to demonstrate “special or exceptional
circumstances”
Bail Act 2013
(NSW). Accordingly,
before this Court hears another release application, the applicant was required
to show that “there are
grounds for such an application” under
. I understood the applicant to submit that he was, as at
24 October 2025, the date of his appeal, in a better position to argue the
grounds of appeal than he was when his previous release application was heard.
In all the circumstances, the Court did not regard
that matter as allowing the
applicant to make a further release application and his application was
dismissed on that basis. The
Court indicated that reasons would be contained in
the substantive judgment. These reasons are set out
Proposed orders
propose the following orders:
(1) Reject the tender of all of the documents which the applicant sought to
tender on appeal and which are the subject of ground
2 of the conviction
(2) Grant leave to appeal on ground 6 of the conviction appeal but otherwise
refuse leave on all other grounds other than ground
12, which does not require
(3) Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
(4) Grant leave to appeal on ground 4 on sentence but otherwise refuse leave.
(5) Dismiss the appeal against sentence.

of Adamson JA. I agree with her Honour’s analysis
and with her
conclusions.
relation to ground 6, having reviewed the evidence in the trial, including its
sufficiency and quality, and for the reasons given
by Adamson JA, none of the
matters raised by the applicant are such as to lead me to experience a
reasonable doubt about the applicant’s
guilt. It follows that, upon the
whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt of the applicant’s

Adamson JA. I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour,
for the reasons her
Honour has given. Having undertaken my own assessment of the evidence, in light
of the arguments advanced in
support of ground 6, I am of the view that it was
well open to the jury to find the applicant guilty.
