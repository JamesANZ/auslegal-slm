Decision D0112024 – Published in note form only
Keeley and PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA
[2024] WAICmr
Date of Decision: 29 August 2024
Information Act 1992
On 28 July 2023,
Wilora Keeley (
the complainant
) applied to PathWest Laboratory Medicine
) under the
Freedom of Information Act 1992
the FOI Act
) for access to documents concerning a deceased family
member’s pathology results and related communications.
of decision dated 5 September 2023, the agency refused the complainant access to
the requested documents on the ground they
were exempt under clause 3(1) of
Schedule 1 to the FOI Act (
clause 3(1)
The complainant applied
for internal review of the agency’s decision and provided additional
information about the documents
she requested. By internal review decision
dated 27 September 2023, the agency varied its initial decision and gave
the complainant
access to an additional document. The agency otherwise
maintained its decision to refuse the complainant access to documents under
clause 3(1).
On 28 September 2023, the complainant applied to the
Information Commissioner (
the Commissioner
) for external review of
the agency’s decision.
The agency provided the Commissioner with
its FOI file maintained in respect of the complainant’s access
application. During
the external review, the agency reconsidered its decision
to refuse the complainant access to documents under clause 3(1) and gave
complainant access to various documents.
As it appeared the agency had
not conducted searches for all documents within the scope of the
complainant’s access application,
the Commissioner requested further
information from the agency about its searches and required additional searches
to be undertaken.
The agency provided the requested information and conducted
additional searches, which located further documents. The agency gave
complainant access to those further documents. However, the complainant claimed
additional documents existed within the scope
of her access application. That
was, in effect, a claim the agency had refused the complainant access to
documents under section
26 of the FOI Act (
April 2024, the Commissioner provided the parties with her preliminary view,
which was that, based on the information then before
her, the agency’s
decision to refuse the complainant access to additional documents under section
26 was justified. The complainant
did not accept the Commissioner’s
preliminary view and provided further submissions.
Section 26 provides
that an agency may refuse access to a document if all reasonable steps have been
taken to locate the document,
and it is satisfied that the document is either in
the agency’s possession but cannot be found or does not exist. The
Commissioner
considers, in dealing with section 26, the following questions must
be answered. First, are there reasonable grounds to believe
the requested
documents exist, or should exist? Second, are the requested documents, or
should the requested documents be, held
by the agency? Where either of those
questions is answered in the affirmative, the next question is, has the agency
taken all reasonable
steps to locate those documents?
As observed in
Re Boland and City of Melville
[1996] WAICmr 53
, the question is
not whether an agency has taken every possible step to locate documents, but
whether it has taken all reasonable
steps. The adequacy of an agency’s
efforts to locate documents is to be judged by having regard to what was
reasonable in
the circumstances: see
Re Leighton and Shire of Kalamunda
[2008] WAICmr52 at [85] and
Re Veale and City of Swan
[2012] WAICmr 12.
Lee v Department of Justice
[2020] WASC 105
, Justice Archer observed
that there is an interrelationship between the reasonableness of searches and
the likelihood that a document
The complainant contended
additional documents should exist, primarily because she asserted the
agency’s own operating procedures
suggested certain record keeping
practices require the creation of certain documents. However, the agency
advised the documents
in question were not created at the relevant time. On the
information before her, the Commissioner was not persuaded there were
grounds to believe additional documents exist.
The complainant also
claimed the agency had not taken all reasonable steps to locate the additional
documents and suggested other
documents within the scope of her access application. Noting that section 26
an agency to take all reasonable steps to locate documents, not all
steps, the Commissioner did not require the agency to undertake
the further
The Commissioner recognised that,
when additional documents are located by an agency after further searches, as
was the case in this
matter, it is understandable that an applicant may be
sceptical about the adequacy of the agency's efforts to meet its obligations
under the FOI Act in the first instance. However, the Commissioner was
satisfied on the information before her that the agency had
complied with its
obligations under the FOI Act in this matter.
After considering all the
material before her, including the searches undertaken by the agency and the
complainant’s further
submissions, the Commissioner was satisfied that the
agency had taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to locate the
documents and additional documents either could not be found or do not
Accordingly, the Commissioner found the agency’s decision to
refuse the complainant access to additional documents under section
FOI Act is justified. Therefore, the Commissioner confirmed the agency’s
