THE DECISION
Not applicable
REASONS FOR DECISION
1. BACKGROUND
This matter was heard earlier by a differently
constituted Tribunal when Orders were made for the Respondent to complete
certain works.
The Builder then undertook negotiations with the Owners for an
Order to Pay in lieu of the Order to Remedy. Negotiations failed and
accordingly
the matter was brought before the Tribunal for an Order to Pay with the
agreement of the Builder. The Owners objected
to the absence of the Builder at
the hearing, but was advised that in the interests of justice the Builder could
be allowed to take
part on a telephone connection and that this was normal
2. ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE
2.1 We had before us several quotations for the remedial
works. These were:
(1) On behalf
of the Builder an assessment by Chris O’Keefe, a Construction Cost
Consultant, dated 10 December for $3,373 at
page 172 of our papers.
(2) A quotation
for the Owners by Kim Loxton of $6,880 dated 5 April 2011 at page 178 of our
(3) A quotation
for the Owners at page 179 for $7,700.
2.2 In explanation Mr Plug stated that the Consultant had made his estimate from
the plan and the Order to Remedy and had not visited
the site. In relation to
the quote he said the family room needed most of the work. The joints needed
redoing with repainting. None
of the ceiling needed replacing. The shelving was
not undersize. One wall would attend to the problems with both corners when
aligned. The gyprock wall would need replacement and it was further up
the wall that it became out of plumb. The Owners could continue
to live there
while the work was being completed. The Owners’ quotations were higher,
but he was not aware of the reasons as
it depended upon what they were asked to
2.3 The Owner said the contractors providing quotations for him had both been
out to look at the house and therefore had a feel for
the work required. The
down-pipes should be connected to the stormwater drain. The shelving needed a
support under the front edge.
There were “two dog-leg walls” as per
the Reasons for Decision. There was a missing down-pipe also on the southwest
and at this point the Builder agreed this needed to be included. All the
gyprock needed removal on both sides and the wall is 3 metres
high. There were
additional unknowns such as the connection of the down- pipes to water
displacement points.
3. CONSIDERATION OF ORDER REQUIRED
3.1 We had to determine the appropriate costs between an
itemised breakdown of the matters taken from the Order to Remedy, which were
required to be repaired, presented by the Builder. As against this were two lump
sum quotes presented by the Owner. There was no
evidence available to explain
how the lump sum quotes had been made up, or what rates had been used, nor the
time to be taken. Both
the Owners quotations were double that of the
Builder’s consultant’s estimate. The work detailed in the quote of
Docking at page 179 did indicate more work on the wall in the dining room
was being considered that appeared necessary and we presume
the same situation
occurred with the other lump sum quote.
3.2 In the circumstances we considered the most reasonable course to take was to
go up from the Builder’s cost estimate rather
than the more arbitrary
method of taking an amount off the quotations provided by the
Accordingly we took the estimate of the consultant at $3,373 and added the
extra down-pipe at $180 plus $18 GST to make $198. To this
contingencies amount of $500 to cover any unforeseen difficulties arising out of
the Cost Consultant not having seen the
house and possibly missing out any
aspect. The consultant would have been well aware of the going rates from his
occupation and so
that aspect would have been correct.
Therefore Orders were made for the Builder to pay the
sum of $4,071 within 21 days of the date of the Orders.
