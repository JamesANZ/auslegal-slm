Appeal Outcome
Not applicable
Offending conduct
The offending conduct involved the offender breaking into and stealing soft
drinks from the Gourmet Food Takeaway Shop in Walgett
on two occasions ‘in
the early hours of 11 December 2013.’[15] The first incident took place at
around 12.40am, and the
second incident at 1.40am. At the time of the offences
the offender was aged 18,[18] and was on a bond of conditional liberty for
months, with only six weeks remaining on it. The bond had been imposed upon the
offender at the Walgett Children’s Court
for an assault upon his father,
committed when he was 17 years old,[33] after his father had been
‘harassing and tormenting’
At ‘about 12:40am’ on the day of the offences, the offender,
together with his cousin Brandon Sharpley, broke into the
shop by kicking the
door of the storeroom. They took a carton of 24 cans of Lift soft drink valued
at $18.[18] On this occasion,
they were captured by CCTV.[18] ‘About an
hour later at 1:40am’ the same two offenders returned to the shop with two
juveniles, entering the storeroom together. The four offenders spent
‘about five minutes’ inside and then left, each
taking a carton of
Powerade drinks worth about $40 each.[19]
The offender had no criminal history ‘of like offences’. The
offences were not accompanied by damage or vandalism.[26]
On 18 December 2013, whilst attending the police station at Walgett, the
offender assisted police by nominating the two juveniles
as the persons involved
in the second offence and confirming police suspicions with respect to the
involvement of his cousin. However,
he declined to make a statement implicating
them and indicated that he would not give evidence against them.[21]
The offender pleaded guilty in the Walgett Local Court to two counts of
aggravated break, enter and steal.[16]
The offender gave evidence acknowledging his role in the offences to the
Court. He also gave evidence that on the day in question
he had commenced
drinking at 10am and was ‘well affected by alcohol’ at the time of
the offences, which her Honour accepted.[22],
Five months prior to this decision, the offender resided and worked on the
Walma property, ‘some 15 kilometres from Walgett’.
His uncle also
resided and worked there. The offender ‘comes into town rarely’, and
no longer drinks in town. He continues
to drink alcohol on the property, but not
in the company of his peer group.[66]
Evidence relating to offender’s background and community relevant to
At the time of this hearing, the offender was 19 years old.[1] He was raised
at the Namoi Mission in Walgett, a community which ‘bears
the scars of
decades of neglect and deprivation.’[1]
In undisputed written submissions on behalf of the offender, the Walgett
Gamilaraay Community Working Party identified, in 2005, the
following issues
facing their community:
and stereotyping of Aboriginal people;
and lack of opportunity;
resources and poor living conditions;
in accessing services;
levels of literacy and numeracy throughout the community; and
student retention and achievement rates and high rates of truancy within the
education system and unacceptably high levels of
criminal activity and
antisocial behaviour.[5]
Uncontested evidence by an Aboriginal Legal
Service field officer, Gary Trindall, identified ‘severe social
depravation’[9]
and ‘entrenched disadvantages’[10] in the
Walgett community. Mr Trindall also gave evidence that the
‘offender’s
parents are both alcoholics,’ with the
offender’s father becoming ‘aggressive’ whilst drinking.[12]
The offender
grew up witnessing such alcoholism, as well as ‘regular
violent incidents,’ in both his home and the wider community.[13]
A pre-sentence Juvenile Justice Report documented the offender’s
‘poor’ literacy and numeracy levels, and his ‘unpredictable
and transient lifestyle, void of adult supervision and guidance.’[14] It
also documented a history of substance abuse.[15]

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/or indicators of disadvantage
Submissions and evidence demonstrating the ‘severe social
deprivation’[9] and ‘entrenched disadvantages’[10]
the offender’s life and his community were put forward including issues
identified by the Walgett Gamilaraay Community
Working Party,[5] an Aboriginal
Legal Service field officer[7] and a pre-sentence Juvenile Justice Report.[14]
In reference to these,
her Honour stated that it ‘is against this
background of profound social and economic deprivation that I must assess his
culpability and apportion weight to the various purposes of
sentencing.’[15]
The Court applied principles, relevant to the sentencing of Aboriginal
offenders and enunciated in
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A Crim R 58
(2013) 249 CLR 571;
[2013] HCA 37
, to the present case.
Her Honour observed the statement from
R v Fernando
‘“the relevance of Aboriginality is not necessarily to mitigate
punishment but rather to explain or throw light
on the particular offence and
the circumstances of the offender.”’[40] Quoting Wood J in that
case, her Honour reemphasised
that where the circumstances of an offender
include abuse of alcohol reflecting the socio-economic circumstances and
environment
in which an offender has grown up, there needs to be:
a realistic recognition by the Court of the endemic presence of alcohol
within Aboriginal communities and the grave social difficulties
faced by those
communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and
other demoralising factors have placed
heavy stresses on them.[41]
As her Honour then explained, this ‘context of the individual is
necessary in order for the Court to properly assess the moral
culpability of the
offender and the competing purposes of sentencing.’[43]
Regarding the intoxicated state of the offender at the time of the offence,
her Honour observed Wood J’s recognition in
R v Fernando
[T]here are Aboriginal communities in which alcohol abuse and alcohol-related
violence go hand in hand. His Honour considered that
when an offender's abuse of
alcohol is a reflection of the environment in which he or she was raised, it
should be taken into account
as a mitigating factor.[44]
Her Honour also quoted the High Court in
in support of this
statement.[45]
Her Honour held that evidence pertaining to the offender’s background
of deprivation, which was sought to be relied on in mitigation
of the sentence,
was established.[46] All of this evidence reduced the offender’s moral
culpability[53] and heightened the
need for his rehabilitation.[54] In relation
to the various purposes of sentencing, the offender’s background of
deprivation
led her Honour to place relatively more weight on the purpose of
rehabilitation[61] than on deterrence.[59]
Relevant passage(s):
In reference to
R v Fernando
and in the context of drunkenness, her
Honour observed the following:
As Justice Wood explained, drunkenness does not usually operate by way of
excuse or to mitigate the offender’s conduct. However,
recognised that there are Aboriginal communities in which alcohol abuse and
alcohol-related violence go hand in hand.
His Honour considered that when an
offender’s abuse of alcohol is a reflection of the environment in which he
or she was raised,
it should be taken into account as a mitigating
factor.[44]
In reference to relying on the offender’s background of deprivation in
mitigation of the sentence, her Honour stated the following:
He is a product of that community and it is therefore necessary that I
consider the various purposes of sentencing and assess his
level of moral
culpability bearing in mind those socioeconomic factors. Failure to do so would
be a failure to fulfil the principle
of individualised justice.[2]
Recognising the history of profound deprivation and giving it weight as a
mitigating factor is not intended to suggest that the Court
is acting upon a
kind of racial stereotyping.[47]
Instead it is relevant to the consideration of the relationship of these
background matters to the assessment of the particular offender’s
culpability and proper consideration of the principles of proportionality and
equal justice.[48]
I am satisfied that the history of socioeconomic deprivation in the community
from which the offender comes and the impact that that
has had upon him reduces
his moral culpability. Notwithstanding the fact that these are not offences of
violence, the offender’s
deprived background and his exposure over the
years to violence and alcohol abuse is relevant to his capacity to mature and
his capacity
to appreciate the wrongfulness and consequences of his
behaviour.[53]
I am satisfied that the offender’s intoxication is a relevant matter in
assessing his moral culpability and is reflecting the
heightened need for
rehabilitation of the offender.[54]
He has grown up with alcohol abuse being, not only a normal part of his home
life, but also a devastating and entrenched problem in
his peer group and
community. He is a young man who committed these offences whilst well affected
by alcohol ... The offender’s
history of socio-economic deprivation is
also relevant to consideration of the countervailing purposes of
sentencing.[55]
In determining what weight to give the various sentencing purposes, her
Honour observed:
The social deprivation in the offender’s youth, background and
community is integrally related to his history of offending and
considerations
of questions of deterrence, rehabilitation and the protection of the
community.[56]
Her Honour then gave proportionately more weight to rehabilitation than to
deterrence:
Having regard to the evidence in this case with respect to the offender's
background and the profound disadvantage that exists in
his community, I am
satisfied that general deterrence should be given less weight than would
ordinarily apply in cases involving
aggravated break, enter and steal.[59]
In the present case I am satisfied that significant weight should be given to
the purpose of rehabilitation. In making this finding
I do not give
disproportionate weight to the offender's subjective circumstances. Instead I
have had regard to the objective seriousness
of the offences which I have
determined to be at the lower end of the range, the absence of multiplicity of
aggravating factors,
the reduced moral culpability of the offender by reason of
his profoundly deprived background and his relative youth.[61]
Her Honour therefore determined that ‘the offender’s background
of profound social deprivation operates to reduce his
moral culpability and to
moderate the weight that is to be given to general deterrence.’[75]
