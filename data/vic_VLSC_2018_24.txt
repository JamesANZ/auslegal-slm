Issues under investigation
issues being investigated are whether The Respondent Lawyer –
to comply with section 187(3) of the Uniform Law;
to comply with rule 52(4) of the Uniform Rules; and
not have proper authority to deal with funds held in trust and has failed to
comply with rule 42(3)(b)(ii) of the Uniform
Investigation
13 November 2017, my office sent letters to the Respondent Lawyer that gave
notice that a disciplinary investigation was to be
undertaken and invited
written submissions.
13 December 2017, the Respondent Lawyer informed my office that he had no
further submissions to make but gave an undertaking to
set down some guidelines
for the withdrawal of trust monies.
Findings of fact on
issues under investigation
Failure to comply with section 187(3)
of the Uniform Law
Complainant submitted that the Respondent Lawyer failed to provide an itemised
bill within 21 days of a valid request for an itemised
bill being made.
Client received the disputed bill on 30 November 2016. On the same day, the
Complainant, acting on the Client’s behalf,
requested an itemised bill by
21 December 2016. This request provided sufficient time for the Respondent
Lawyer to comply with his
obligations under section 187(3) of the Uniform Law.
The itemised bill was not provided until 29 March 2017, 119 days after it had
been requested and after my office became involved in the dispute.
an email dated 27 August 2017, the Respondent Lawyer submitted that he had used
a professional costing service and forwarded the
account to the Complainant as
soon as he received the account. Despite requests for supporting information for
this claim, the Respondent
Lawyer did not make any further submissions.
Respondent Lawyer has not complied with section 187(3) of the Uniform Law. Given
the passage of time from the request to the provision
of the itemised bill this
breach amounts to unsatisfactory professional conduct, and the Respondent Lawyer
should be cautioned.
Failure to comply with rule 52(4)
of the Uniform Rules
Complainant submitted that the Respondent Lawyer did not provide a trust account
statement within a reasonable time after it was
requested. The request was made
for the statement on 30 November 2016, it was not provided until 29 March
reviewed the information provided, the trust account statement was not provided
to the Client as soon as practicable, either
after the matter ended, or after
the Respondent Lawyer was asked to provide the statement. Given the retainer
ended on 2 August 2016,
the provision of the trust account statement on 29 March
2017, some seven months and 27 days after the cessation of the retainer,
compliant with rule 52(4) of the Uniform Rules.
Respondent Lawyer did not provide any reasons for the delay in providing the
trust account statement to the Client. Having regard
for the significant delay
in providing the trust account statement this breach amounts to unsatisfactory
professional conduct, and
the Respondent Lawyer should be
Failure to comply with rule 42(3)(b)(ii) of
the Uniform Rules
trust account statement dated 29 March 2017 shows that on 13 December 2016, an
amount of $4,869.65 held in the Law Practice’s
trust account was paid to
the office account in part payment of the Client’s bill dated 30 November
evidence shows the retainer ceased on 2 August 2016 and, on 30 November 2016,
the Complainant informed the Respondent Lawyer that
the Client objected to any
trust funds being withdrawn.
Respondent Lawyer claims to have relied on clause 6 in the Costs Agreement for
withdrawing the funds after the retainer had ended.
Clause 6 of the agreement
states that while a client may revoke their consent for the Law Practice to
handle trust monies on seven
days’ notice, the Law Practice remains
entitled to withdraw funds from trust for payment of legal costs accrued up to
an including
the expiry of that seven day notice period.
do not accept the Respondent Lawyer’s argument that under the Costs
Agreement, he has not erred in withdrawing the funds from
trust on 13 December
2016. The Respondent Lawyer did not have express authority to withdraw the
funds. To the contrary, in the letter
from the Complainant dated 30 November
2016, he had been told expressly not to withdraw funds. The Respondent
Lawyer’s argument
that he was acting in accordance with clause 6 of the
Costs Agreement is contradicted by the fact that the funds were withdrawn from
trust on 13 December 2016, six days after the expiry of the seven day time
period allowed under clause 6 of the Costs Agreement.
42(3)(b)(ii) of the Uniform Rules requires that without express authority to
withdraw funds, the Law Practice must wait 30 days
after the provision of an
itemised bill. The itemised bill was requested on 30 November 2016 with the
funds being withdrawn prior
to the expiry of the 30 day time frame provided in
rule 42(3)(b)(ii).
had the Client expressly object to the withdrawal of trust funds and not waiting
the requisite time period of 30 days after
the provision of an itemised bill,
the Law Practice did not have authority to withdraw the funds from trust. This
breach in handling
trust monies amounts to unsatisfactory professional conduct,
and the Respondent Lawyer should be cautioned.
296 of the Uniform Law sets out that unsatisfactory professional conduct
includes conduct of a lawyer occurring in connection
with the practice of law
that falls short of the standard of competence and diligence that a member of
the public is entitled to
expect of a reasonably competent lawyer.
52(4) of the Uniform Rules set out that a trust account statement is to be given
as soon as practicable after the completion
of the matter or a soon as
practicable after the person for whom the money is held makes a request for the
statement during the course
of the matter.
42(3)(b)(ii) of the Uniform Rules provides that a law practice may withdraw the
trust money for payment of legal costs if the
law practice has given the person
a bill relating to the money and referring to the proposed withdrawal. If a
person objects to the
amount specified in the bill within seven business days
but has not referred the matter to a designated regulatory authority, the
practice must wait 30 days after the date on which the person received an
itemised bill following a request made in accordance
with section 187 of the
Uniform Law.
Characterisation of conduct, determination &
to section 298(b) of the Uniform Law conduct consisting of a contravention of
the Uniform Rules is conduct capable of constituting
unsatisfactory professional
conduct or professional misconduct.
find that the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct is properly characterised as
unsatisfactory professional conduct because it occurred
in connection with legal
practice and falls short of the standard of competence and diligence that a
member of the public is entitled
to expect of a reasonably competent
I find a caution to be the appropriate order in all of the circumstances. In
arriving at this decision, I have taken into
account that the Respondent Lawyer
has (in his letter to my office dated 13 December 2017) demonstrated an
acceptance of the likely
findings and orders of my office.
considered all of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I determine
that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the orders detailed
to Section 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, or seek a
review by the
VCAT, of this determination made under section 299 of the Uniform
Non-compliance
failure to comply with a determination made under section 299 is capable of
constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or
professional misconduct
pursuant to section 298(h) of the Uniform Law.
