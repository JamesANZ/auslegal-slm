BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE IN A POST-PANDEMIC

I INTRODUCTION
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and physical health and
wellbeing of people globally has been
significant.
The higher education
sector has not been immune. In the height of the pandemic, abrupt disruption was
experienced within the sector
as staff and students had to physically disconnect
from campuses and many universities had to swiftly adopt new remote teaching
in order to overcome the restrictions imposed by government. Many
academics worked overtime remotely to ensure that their students’
progress was not adversely impacted or significantly delayed due to the
As we begin to slowly emerge into a post-pandemic world, it is evident that
the psychological needs of belonging and agency are critical
for learning and
teaching in higher education, for both students and
Communities of practice
provide an opportunity for members to connect, share knowledge and develop
practices to enrich their discipline.
Being a part of a community of practice
builds staff-to-staff relationships (belonging) and improves teaching practice
The approaches to establishing communities of practice vary between higher
education institutions.
outlines the pilot project undertaken by a Curtin University innovation and
scholarship of learning and teaching (iSOLT)
project team, comprised of
multidisciplinary academics (from the disciplines of Law, Economics, Nursing and
Marketing) who are working
towards establishing an international community of
best practice for assessment rubrics with a focus on building strong
staff-to-staff
relationships through mentoring, peer-to-peer learning, and
interdisciplinary engagement.
II COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE
Although the core concepts of community of practice have existed for a long
time, the term and practice has gained popularity in the
higher education sector
and literature thanks to the extensive works of Wenger and
colleagues.
Wenger defines
communities of practice as ‘groups of people who share a concern or a
passion for something they do and learn
how to do it better as they interact
regularly’.
Wenger identifies
three key characteristics that are unique to communities of practice:
– participants collectively share an interest and
competence with respect to a common ‘domain of interest’;
– through building relationships with each
other, participants engage, share and work together in pursuit of furthering the
‘domain of interest’; and
– participants are practitioners in the area of
shared practice to which the ‘domain of interest’
Research indicates that communities of practice improve organisational
performance as they ‘drive strategy, generate new lines
of business, solve
problems, promote the spread of best practice, develop people’s
professional skills, and help companies
recruit and retain
Beyond the tangible
benefits, communities of practice also provide a ‘mode of belonging’
for participants.
Involvement in
communities of practice is voluntary and participants tend to join based on
interest and commitment to a common cause
or goal. Participants see the inherent
benefits of being associated with the community and seek to build and exchange
ideas, knowledge,
and solutions.
In the higher education sector, communities of practice can operate at many
levels – for example, they can be fostered at a
school, faculty,
university, or cross-institutional level either locally, nationally, or
internationally. The advancement of technology
and the expansion of the internet
has meant that communities of practice may reach beyond traditional geographical
limitations.
Today engagement
within these communities can occur face-to-face, virtually or through a hybrid
III COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE FOR ASSESSMENT RUBRICS
A key aim of the pilot project undertaken by the Curtin University iSOLT
project team is to establish an international interdisciplinary
community of
best practice with respect to the development and adoption of assessment
rubrics. The team members share a common understanding
of the value of
assessment rubrics in learning and teaching and the benefit to the student
experience, and the need to drive excellence
and innovation in assessment rubric
design within their respective disciplines and teaching areas. More
specifically, the team members
see assessment rubrics as a critical instrument
for ensuring assessments align with discipline and profession
and that there is proper
scaffolding of unit learning outcomes, course learning outcomes and graduate
capabilities to a standard
that complies with the Tertiary Education Quality and
Standards Agency (TEQSA) and professional accreditation
requirements.
Team members also
recognise, perhaps most critically, that assessment feedback through the use of
rubrics enables students to reflect
on their learning and to identify their
level of competency for relevant discipline skills and
To evaluate how students and academics understand and interact with
assessment rubrics, the project team have conducted focus groups
with academic
staff and students from the disciplines of Law, Economics and Nursing. This
research is on-going and will soon extend
to Marketing. From the focus groups
conducted to date, it is evident that the use of assessment rubrics is prevalent
within the Law,
Economics and Nursing disciplines at Curtin University, where
the policy is that an assessment rubric must be used by
As a part of the pilot , the project team seeks to develop generic assessment
rubric models for each of the four disciplines informed
by research, best
practice and qualitative data gathered from the focus groups. Furthermore, it is
intended for the assessment rubric
models to be developed to align with and
satisfy the legal obligations of universities with respect to assuring
assessment and student
attainment of learning outcomes and the graduate
capabilities pursuant to the
Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold
Standards) 2015
(Cth). True to the essence of communities of practice, the
project team will share the generic assessment rubric models with members
broader discipline community for the purpose of information sharing and
promoting best practice, but also for feedback and
improvement.
In the pursuit of best practice, the project team also seeks to facilitate
research and explore additional pedagogical support that
academics and students
can use with assessment rubrics to fully utilise the direct and indirect
benefits associated with the use
of rubrics. For example, the team promotes
facilitating law students’ use of additional support such as assessment
self-reflection exercises, guided peer-review activities, group
discussions, targeted assessment feedback, etc, in conjunction with
rubrics to provide students with further opportunities to develop their
evaluative judgement and
Drawing on the
knowledge and expertise sharing that is characteristic of communities of
practice, the project team believes that
building on and exploring further
additional pedagogical supports within the community of best practice will yield
the best results
as participants will undoubtedly have varying teaching
expertise, experiences and approaches.
The project team intend to expand this community of
best practice beyond Curtin University (Perth and Dubai campuses) and to welcome
academics from other institutions and disciplines. Participation in this
community of best practice will continue virtually, to accommodate
international
participants from the Curtin campuses in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as
other academics around the world.
IV CONCLUSION
The full effects of the pandemic are still unfolding, particularly in the
Australian higher education sector. Many academics are having
to contend with
budgetary restraints and increasing workloads, on the back of a few hard years
of working overtime through the height
of the pandemic. In these trying times,
the psychological needs of belonging and agency are critical for academics.
Engagement in
a community of practice is a viable solution to assist academics
to feel a sense of belonging and agency, to stay grounded, feel
supported and
reduce stress, all the while facilitating knowledge sharing and capacity
The community of best practice for assessment rubrics was created with the
focus of building strong staff-to-staff relationships to
facilitate a sense of
belonging and camaraderie between colleagues at school, faculty, university and
cross-institutional levels.

virtual international interdisciplinary community of best practice for
assessment rubrics,
