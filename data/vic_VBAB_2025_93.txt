Subject Land
Respondent is the relevant building surveyor appointed to building work at the
Subject Land to perform functions pursuant to the
Building Act 1993
23 December 2024, the Respondent issued a Form 6 determination determining that
protection work was required for the Adjoining
Property. The proposed building
work that gave rise to the need for protection work was listed as
‘Construction of a Double
Storey Dwelling & Associated Garage (1ai,

THE APPLICANTS’ SUBMISSIONS (in summary form)
Applicants made the following submissions:
(a) There were three sets of engineering drawings submitted during this process,
being revisions A, B & C, (“Plan A”,
“Plan B” and
“Plan C”. However, Plan A was the document received by the
Applicants with the Form 7 and that
relevant for our decision.
(b) The Applicants note that Plan A failed to address potential risks to the
foundation of their driveway and there were no protective
measures in place to
safeguard the structural integrity of the Adjoining Property. Plan A fails to
address the geology of the site
and serious safety concerns and does not have
adequate structural protection of sloped concrete driveway, boundary fence or
regard to soil conditions. Further, Plan A does not meet the requirements
of reg 113 of the
Building Regulations 2018
Regulations
(c) Plan B was provided and incorporated robust structural protection measures
but was then retracted. This was despite the alterations
being made by an
engineer after considering the Applicants’ response.
(d) Plan C provides the most protection to the driveway but does not offer
adequate mitigation of the excavation risks given the
depth required and soil
conditions. The proposed building work effectively creates a steep drop or cliff
beside a low timber fence
less than 1m in height which creates a high risk fall
hazard. Not risk mitigation is in place for this. Further, there is no
consideration
(i) The lateral soil pressure from driveway loadings;
(ii) Undermining of concrete driveway edge;
(iii) Fence stability; or
(iv) Water flow and soil erosion risk due to slope and soil conditions.
(e) The Form 9 approved the Plan A excavation to a depth of 1.4 m on the
boundary. There is a threat of undermining of the concrete
driveway and there is
a lack of protective buffer zone.
(f) There are inadequate engineering solutions. Plan B provided a more robust
solution including bored soldier piling and shotcrete
but the plan was
(g) Plan C appears to be a minor modification of Plan A which offers little
improvement over the original design. The hit and miss
method proposed does not
provide adequate protection given the excavation depth. The soil conditions also
include clay and silt which
may not support this method.
(h) There has been a lack of transparency regarding why Plan B was retracted and
Plan C chosen.
(i) The Applicants have raised concerns with the professional record of the RBS.
We note that this is not evidence of whether the
protection work is appropriate
and will not consider it further.
Applicants seek a more appropriate protection work plan be provided which
includes proper regard to the site conditions.
Applicants would like the Form 9 set aside and consideration given to Plan B or
alternatively an effective excavation buffer.
RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSIONS (in summary form)
Respondent provided the following submissions:
(a) The buffer zone requested would defeat the purpose of protection work.
(b) The engineering design has taken into account the site conditions, the
excavation depth and soil pressures. The hit and miss
methodology is appropriate
for the circumstances to minimise damage.
(c) The security of the site and fall prevention is not part of protection work.
(d) The agricultural drain and engineer design will mitigate the risk of
destabilised soil.
(e) The Interested Party has provided multiple responses to the
Applicants’ concerns and both Plan A and Plan C were certified
THE INTERESTED PARTY’S SUBMISSIONS (in summary form)
Interested Party provided the following submissions:
(a) The Interested Party has engaged with the Applicants in good faith and
obtained a protection work consultant, Mr Payne, of Deemed
Consulting. Mr Payne was engaged to ensure all protection measures met
appropriate standards. The Applicants refused the
updated protection work.
(b) The Applicants have not offered any expert evidence in support of their
(c) The Applicants appear to believe protection work must eliminate all risk to
the Adjoining Property but the test is whether the
protection work is
appropriate
(d) The Interested Party states he issued revised and enhanced plans on multiple
occasions. This includes an updated protection work
package dated 6 March 2025
which is similar to Plan C but has enhanced clarification and confirmation of
compliance with applicable
(e) Plan B was issued in error and promptly withdrawn after updated engineering
advice which stated the proposed measures were excessive
for the relatively
shallow and localised nature of the excavation. Both Plan A and C were certified
by registered engineers. Plan
C complies with reg 113 of the Regulations.
All Metro Geotech Pty Ltd Report dated 6 May 2024 confirmed the site is
classified P per AS 2870 which indicates it as problematic.

February 2025 respectively. The two Form 8 documents

Form 9 decision states that:
am the relevant building surveyor appointed on 18/12/2024 under
Building Act 1993
by or on behalf of the owner, David Chen.

section 85(1)(b)
Building Act 1993
the adjoining owner's notice, the adjoining owner disagreed with the proposed
protection work/required more information to be given
to enable the proposal for
protection work to be considered by me. I attach a copy of the adjoining owner's
notice to this determination.
a result of the adjoining owner's notice, I am required by the
Building Act 1993
to examine the owner's proposal for protection work.
received the owner's proposal for protection work under
Building Act 1993
on 10/01/2025. I attach the owner's proposal for protection
work to this determination.
making this determination, I have examined the owner's proposal for protection
considering all matters required of me under the
Building Act 1993
Building Regulations 2018
, I determine the owner's proposal for protection work
is appropriate.
Form 9 makes no reference to the Form 7 document dated 4 February 2025 or the
Form 8 dated 16 February 2025. It further particularly
references the earlier
Form 7 and Form 8. This leads to a conclusion that the Form 9 has not had regard
to the updated proposed protection
work but rather has made a decision on the
earlier Form 7 and Form 8 documents.
RBS has restricted his consideration to an assessment of the appropriateness of
protection work outlined in the Form 7 dated 29
December 2024 and the concerns
raised in the Form 8 dated 14 January 2025. This also has ramifications for our
are bound to assess the appropriateness of protection work
which was the subject of the Form 9.
note the following set out in the Form 7 dated 29 December 2024:
(a) The Form 7 dated 29 December 2024 provides the following details on
protection work:
Build according to structured engineering certified plans attached (sic).
(b) Reg 113(1)(e) of the Regulations (extracted above) requires the Form 7 to
include plans and specifications for the proposed protection
work that contain
sufficient detail to show how the protection work will protect the adjoining
property from the effects of building
(c) Reg 113(2)(b) confirms the prescribed details of the proposed protection
work are the relevant details set out in Form 7 and
the documents required under
reg 113(1)(e)
(d) The Form 7 enclosed ‘Plan A’ as the proposed protection work
the above, the BAB has jurisdiction to review the Plan A proposed protection
work because this was the protection work proposal
enclosed under the Form 7
dated 29 December 2024 and deemed appropriate under the Form 9.
further note that the Form 7 did not actually provide any proposed protection
work. It simply attached the structural engineering
certified plans. Whilst a
method of building construction can also be a protection measure it is not
specified how the building method
will in fact protect the adjoining property.
In this respect, the Form 7 from a procedural view, is inadequate as it does not
the prescribed information outlined under the regulatory regime of the
Act and its Regulations.
further note that it is not our task to assess the protection work outlined in
the latter Form 7 and Form 8 documents which amended
the proposed protection
work to respond to concerns of the Applicants. This may be considered as an
acknowledgement that more protection
work detail or work was required.
are not satisfied that the proposed protection work will protect the Adjoining
Property. Specifically, the protection work, as
documented on the Plan A
engineering documents has the following deficiencies:
order for the sleeper retaining wall RW1 to be constructed immediately adjacent
to the boundary, a cut close to vertical of up
to 1.4m must be established
immediately beneath which footing excavations must be drilled up to 1.5m deep.
This means local excavations
of up to 2.9m. This is a potentially unstable
situation, and no geotechnical advice has been provided indicating that it would
stable or that it might require specific works to ensure stability.
associated documentation refers to staging of (or hit and miss) excavation, the
Plan A engineering documents do not require
this. At sheet S2.5, they
Where retaining walls are proposed in close
proximity to existing building (sic) and services, a hit and miss
sequence/procedure is
to be adopted (contact the relevant engineer in such a
case if not shown on these plans).No structural footing shall be undermined
during construction.
condition offers no protection for the driveway pavement or otherwise to the
adjoining property.
if a hit and miss sequence was adopted, it would require supporting geotechnical
advice and does not obviate the deep cuts what
would need to be over 2m
there may be other assurances offered in associated documentation, this is
insufficient. Protection work must either be documented
as submitted on and
with the Form 7 or a variation imposed by the Form 9 determination.
above is sufficient for us to conclude that the proposed protection work is not
appropriate.
have considered varying the Respondent’s decision or replacing it with our
own. However, given the lack of geotechnical
information, it is not clear what
a suitable scheme of protection work may be. Furthermore, to arrive at such a
scheme is likely
to involve choices and other factors such as construction
methods and perhaps alignments. These decisions are best made by those
responsible for the project.
DATE OF DETERMINATION: 16 July 2025
Unless the Building Appeals
Board otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the [BAB] must bear
his, her or its own costs
