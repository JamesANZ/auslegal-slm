VICTORIAN CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL
ANTI DISCRIMINATION LIST
No. 26/1997
APPLICANT/COMPLAINANT:
Adrian Allisey
RESPONDENT:
Otis Building Technologies Pty Ltd
WHERE HELD:
Judge Davey, Vice President
DATE OF ORDER:
18 November 1998
APPEARANCES
For the Applicant: Ms Cohen of Counsel instructed by Goddard Elliot
For the Respondent: Mr Griffin of Counsel instructed by Barker Gosling
REASONS FOR COSTS ORDER
1. In these proceedings I reserved the question of costs at the time I
published my decision. The Respondent represented by Mr Griffin
of Counsel has
made an application for costs pursuant to that reservation. At the outset I note
that it was agreed by both parties
that notwithstanding the commencement of the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal on 1 July 1998 the appropriate
section for
the determination of costs is s138 of the
Equal Opportunity
") and not s109 of the
Victorian Civil and
Administrative Tribunal Act
1998 ("the VCAT Act").
2. After announcing my decision at the conclusion of the hearing Ms Cohen of
Counsel acting on behalf of the Complainant requested
me to provide written
3. I note that on the commencement of the VCAT Act s138 of the
Opportunity Act
was repealed by the
Tribunals and Licensing
Authorities (Miscellaneous Amendments)
1998. The transitional
provisions are contained in the second schedule to that Act. Clause 9 of the
Second Schedule deals with pending
proceedings and provides that a pending
proceeding, that is a proceeding that was pending before the commencement of
VCAT, is to
be taken to have been commenced in the new Tribunal and "the
procedure that applies is the procedure prescribed by the VCAT Act".
clause 9(1)(e) of the Second Schedule provides:-
"The new Tribunal has only the powers, functions and duties which the
former Tribunal would have had in relation to the proceeding
under the enabling
enactment and the Act by which the former Tribunal was established had the
commencement day not arrived;"
That paragraph would seem to make it clear that the power to award costs in
relation to a pending proceeding should be dealt with
in accordance with the
repealed existing legislation. In the event that I had considered that the
transitional provisions created
any difficulty I would have made an order under
clause 14 of Schedule 2 that s138 of the
should apply to this
proceeding.
4. Section 138(1) is in the following terms
"The Tribunal may order the payment of costs fixed by the Tribunal in any
proceedings before the Tribunal"
On its face that sub-section gives to the Tribunal an unfettered discretion
on the question of costs. It may be limited to some extent
by the terms of
s138(2). That section requires in substance the Tribunal to fix a sum that
reflects the costs reasonably incurred
and any other pecuniary loss incurred by
that person because of the proceedings unless there are special circumstances.
The operation
of the predecessor of s138 of the
, that is s147 of the
Equal Opportunity Act
1984 which is in similar terms was
considered by the Court of Appeal in
Spencer v Dowling
[1996] VSC 51
[1997] 2 VR
However the section was then really only considered in the context
of whether or not the words in ss138(2) required the Board to fix
costs on an
indemnity basis. The Court in fact decided that the words permitted the Board
to fix costs on a normal party/party basis.
Although Winneke P noted at page 146
that the Act
"is at pains to restrict the costs of the proceedings before the
he did not go on to consider the circumstances in which it was appropriate
for the discretion to award costs be exercised. Callaway
JA who agreed with the
reasons of the President, went on to state at page 163-
The language of ss 47(2) and 138(2) is not itself determinative of the
choice between party and party and solicitor and client costs,
because it is
necessary to ask for what purpose or from what point of view the costs were
"reasonably incurred". In my opinion those
words mean "properly incurred for the
attainment of justice", not "legitimately incurred by a person in his or her own
interests".
Nothing said in that case is directed towards limiting the discretion of the
Tribunal in the award of costs. It is my view that the
effect of the section is
to permit the Tribunal to award costs in its discretion provided that discretion
is exercised in a fair
and just manner having regard to all the relevant
circumstances. Naturally in the exercise of this discretion one must take into
account the social nature of the legislation and the circumstances of the
particular proceedings.
5. Mr Griffin on behalf of the Respondent urged me to award his client's
costs on the basis that this was not an ordinary anti-discrimination
put it that it was simply a money claim. He also observed that well before the
commencement of the hearing of the proceeding
the Respondent's defence put the
Complainant squarely on notice that his client was going to rely on s81 of the
. At the end of the day his client succeeded in that defence. It was
accepted that the redundancy scheme developed by the Respondent
was a generous
scheme which had been specially structured to give greater assistance to older
workers because the company's research
showed that those workers would be likely
to have greater difficulty in getting another job. I regarded the Respondent's
as a strong defence.
On the other hand Ms Cohen of Counsel for the Complainant contended that
having regard to the nature of the legislation which has
a clearly social
objective and the past practices of the Equal Opportunity Board and former
Tribunal I should not award costs against
her client. She also urged me not to
allow the witness costs of some three witnesses that the Respondent had flown in
from Sydney.
She said that if the Respondent had filed proper witness statements
that would have been unnecessary. I noted however that she cross-examined
the witnesses and did so in a more than cursory manner. She also said that s81
was a difficult section to interpret and that
I had acknowledged as much in my
reasons for the decision.
After having carefully considered the relevant legislation and the arguments
raised by both Counsel I am of the opinion that this
is an appropriate case to
award costs against the Complainant. This decision should not be construed as a
reflection of my opinion
of the past practices of the Board and former Tribunal
in respect to costs. There are in my opinion many cases in which a respondent
successful but it would be quite inappropriate to award costs against the
complainant in that case. I have reduced the witness
costs by 50% because in my
opinion at least some of those costs could have been avoided if the Respondent
had filed more complete
witness statements. I confirm that the costs are to be
paid on a normal party/party basis to be assessed by the Principal Registrar
Scale C of the County Court Scale.
