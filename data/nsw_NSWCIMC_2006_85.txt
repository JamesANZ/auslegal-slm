Rachael Thiele v Secure Paper Services Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCIMC 85 (26 June 2006)
CHIEF INDUSTRIAL MAGISTRATE’S COURT
New South Wales
Secure Paper Services Pty Ltd
Case Number:
Hearing Dates:
Date of Decision:
Magistrate:
Legislation:
Industrial Relations Act 1996
Representation:
Applicant in Person
Respondent : Martin
The Applicant Rachael Thiele
claims that the Respondent is liable to pay the Applicant $2500 in outstanding
commissions arising from
her employment with the Respondent as a salesperson
from 1 August 2005 to the 21 December 2005. The Applicant elected to have her
claim dealt with as a small claim pursuant to
section 379
Relations Act 1996
Unable to bring the parties to an amicable settlement
I proceeded to hear the claim in an informal manner in the spirit of
At the hearing the Applicant was present and for the Respondent were Martin
English, the Respondent’s secretary, and the Respondent’s
director, Tim Pears.
In October 2005 the Applicant’s commission
structure was changed from $5,000 on $90,000 on invoiced revenue, to $2,500 on
revenue of $45,000. Upon termination the Applicant states she made the
target but has not been paid her commission.
Documents before the Court
indicate the Applicant’s total claim with invoice numbers total
$50,331.50. However, the respondent
claims that to be deducted from this figure
is $4,222 in “scheduled sales” and $6,296.50 in “one off
for leads and work given to the applicant by Tim Pears and Mark Mc
Graw(?) to assist her in getting established within the company.
Applicant admits she was given some leads to assist her, and said others were
given to her, as she was the salesperson in the
office at the time. However, the
issue from my perspective is not the fact she was assisted, as from my
experience over some 35 years
this occurs with salespersons new to either to an
industry or to an employer, but whether this work was given with conditions
The Applicant states that at no time was she told that
commission on the work given to her was depended on her staying with the
In fact she stated, “there was no strings attached”. Tim
Pears in his written statement states in or about October 2005
when discussing
the new commission arrangement he said to the Applicant words to the following
effect- “However, I wish to
make it very clear we are granting this
concession on the basis you are going to be with the company for at least
another year”.
The Applicant denies that this was ever said.
difficulty I have, is in the applicant’s statement to the Court there is
no mention by her of the Respondent raising with
her during her lengthy
endeavours to receive the commission that the Respondent was going to remove
from her sales logs “the
sales not attributed to the applicant”. The
first mention of this specifically is in the respondent’s submissions
with the Court on 1 June 2006. In fact I gained the impression that this
was a change in tactics by the Respondent from the Respondent’s
position that the applicant would only be paid her commission under the new
arrangement if she stayed with the company.
A difficult situation for the
respondent as the impression I gained was that the Respondent was not unhappy to
see the Applicant
leave (see diary notes).
In answer to a direct question
from me as to whether the Applicant was told that commissions on the work given
was dependent on the
Applicant staying with the Respondent, Mr Pairs stated he
“did not say it as she was committing herself to the
In all the circumstances I prefer the Applicant’s
version that there was no agreement that the leads or work given to her as
“freebies” were to be deducted from her target
Accordingly there is a verdict for the Applicant.
Respondent is ordered to pay the Applicant the amount of $2,500 for outstanding
entitlements plus interest on that amount from
21 December 2005 to today at the
rates prescribed plus Court costs of $65.
The above monies are to be paid
to the Downing Centre Local Court within 28 days.
