REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 10 SEPTEMBER
Hearing 10 September 2008 at Adelaide
STURT RIVER CARAVAN PARK V DORAY (RP08/0030)
APPLICATION LODGED 28 August 2008
ORDERS SOUGHT Vacant possession
RESIDENTIAL PARK TENANCY AGREEMENT DETAILS
Rented property: PS09, Van 26, Sturt River Caravan Park, Darlington
Owner: Beven Charles Hefford
Resident: Laurent Doray
commenced: 27 July 2007
Period of agreement: Periodic
Rent: $155.00
per week, payable weekly
Security Bond: $170.00 was paid by the resident
and lodged with the Commissioner (Bond No. 7000341-7).
Sworn evidence was given in person by Mr Siegfred
Dannell, Manager of the Park.
The resident and anyone who lives at the rented property were given notice of
the hearing. The resident was not at the hearing.
The resident is still in possession of the rented property.
The residential park tenancy agreement comes under the
Residential Parks Act
I accept that a notice of termination (Form A) dated 10 August 2008 was
served on the resident because of rent arrears and unpaid
electricity
The notice of termination is incorrect. It did not give the resident
fourteen clear days to pay the amount outstanding.
Although the electricity accounts were paid, rent is still only paid to 21
August 2008 with $4.00 held as a part payment.
I have taken into account all the evidence and have decided that, even though
the notice of termination is invalid, the resident may
stay at the rented
property if payments are made as ordered. Due to the resident’s poor
payment history the resident will
be required to move out of the rented property
if payments in clause 1 are not made in full and on time.
The following order requires the rent to be paid. Although the resident paid
the electricity account referred to in the notice of
termination, accounts are
already accumulating for new electricity use. I note that the Park bills the
resident weekly for electricity
use and an account was rendered on 3 September
and will be rendered on 10 September 2008. The resident must pay the
electricity
accounts in addition to the payments below or the landlord may serve
a new notice of termination.

Sections 116(1)(c)
, (f) and (g) and

December 2008 with $139.00 in hand.
If the resident does not make payment 1(a) or 1(b) and does not move
out of the property by the time stated
the park owner may lodge a statutory
declaration to that effect and an up-to-date rent record. If a Deputy Registrar
of the Tribunal
is satisfied that the payment was not made, the bailiff will be
instructed to evict anyone remaining at the property without delay.
If the resident does not make any one of the payments 1(c) - 1(f) and
does not move out of the property by the time stated
the park owner may
apply for an urgent hearing to have the bailiff immediately evict anyone
remaining at the property.
