Corporations
(Cth) (Act) that would have the effect of enabling the
plaintiffs, in their capacity as receivers and managers of Northern Iron Pty
(Company), to seek leave from the court pursuant to
to transfer all the shares in the Company to the proponent of a deed of company
arrangement (DOCA).
plaintiffs filed a certificate of urgency certifying the matter was of such
urgent nature that the originating process was required
to be listed on an
urgent basis. For that reason, it has been listed before me this morning.

(a) an affidavit of Hayden Leigh White, the first plaintiff and one of the
Company's receivers and managers, filed 8 October 2025;
(b) an affidavit of Richard Johnson, a partner at Ashurst Australia, the
solicitors for the plaintiffs, filed 9 October 2025.

well as oral submissions from senior counsel who
appeared before me today.
administrators of the Company and the deed proponent have both appeared at
today's hearing and indicated that they consent to
the orders sought by the
plaintiffs.
Factual background
Company is a privately owned mining company and has less than
50 shareholders. Its primary business is the production of high-grade
magnetite concentrate (Product) from the Warrego Rehabilitation Project, located
within the Warrego Mine site, near Tennant Creek
in the Northern Territory
10 August 2023, the Company entered into two agreements with Cargill
International Trading Pte Limited (Cargill) to fund the development
operation of the Project and sale of its Product,
(a) a Prepayment Advance Facility Agreement, pursuant to which Cargill provided
loan funds of approximately $US21.05 million to the
Company (Facility
Agreement); and
(b) an offtake agreement, dated 10 August 2023, pursuant to which Cargill agreed
to purchase the Product from the Company. The Company
and Cargill agreed to set
off amounts payable in respect of such purchases against amounts owing under the
Facility Agreement
(together, the Funding
Agreements).
the Funding Agreements, the Company granted Cargill a security interest in its
present and future property and its mining
12 April 2025, the Company's directors resolved to appoint voluntary
administrators to the Company, and Stuart Reid and Samantha
Sellahewa of Rodgers
Reidy were appointed as the joint and separate administrators of the Company
(Administrators). Immediately prior
to this date, the Company took steps to
stand down operations at the
afterwards, on 14 April 2025, Cargill appointed the plaintiffs as joint and
several receivers and managers of the
21 May 2025, on the application by the Administrators, Justice Banks-Smith made
orders extending the convening period of the second
creditors' meeting from
22 May 2025 to 24 November
second creditors' meeting of the Company was held on 7 October 2025. At
this meeting, the Company's creditors resolved to enter
into a DOCA on the terms
proposed by AG River Energy Pty Ltd, as set out in the Administrators'
report dated 26 September
of the conditions precedent of the DOCA is that approval of the court is
obtained pursuant to s 444GA of the Act to transfer
all of the Company's
shares to the deed proponent or its nominee. The DOCA proposes that the
plaintiffs file the application rather
than the Administrators. If the
plaintiffs' application fails, an application is to be filed by the
Administrators.
White's evidence is that the plaintiffs have taken an active role in the Company
as receivers and managers, as they have, in addition
to their control of the
Company's property, managed its business and run the sales
Mr White says that, as a consequence, the plaintiffs have sufficient
familiarity with the structure of the DOCA, the Project, the
operations and assets, and the financial and timing consequences of any delay in
the transfer of the Company's shares to
For these reasons, it is contended that the plaintiffs should have the carriage
of the s 444GA application and not the Administrators.
Should the order sought by the plaintiffs under s 447A
447A(1) of the Act provides that:
The Court may make such order as it thinks appropriate about how this Part is to
operate in relation to a particular company.
this section, orders can be made as to how pt 5.3A is to operate 'in
relation to a particular section'. It is recognised to
be a broad power that

accept that the plaintiffs, as receivers and managers of the Company, have
standing under s 447A(4)(f) to make this application
as interested
the following reasons, I consider it is appropriate to make the orders sought by
the plaintiffs.
the order sought by the plaintiffs is relatively minor and does not, in my view,
impact the rights of creditors or any other
All that is sought by the plaintiffs is permission for the plaintiffs to bring
the s 444GA application that is required to implement
the DOCA. These
orders do not attempt to negate any feature of pt 5.3A of the Act and in
fact, in my view, will aid the resolution
of the Company's external
administration.
granting the relief sought by the plaintiffs is, in my view, consistent with the
objects of pt 5.3A of the Act, as it will
facilitate the transfer of shares
under the proposed terms of the DOCA and assist in finalising the external
administration of the
I accept Mr White's evidence that given their significant involvement in
the Company's operations since their appointment,
the plaintiffs are in a better
position than the Administrators to bring an application under s 444GA(1)
of the Act.
Conclusion and orders
these reasons, I consider it is appropriate to make orders in terms of the
plaintiffs' minute of proposed orders dated 10 October
2025, subject to the
amendment discussed in relation to
certify that the preceding paragraph(s) comprise the reasons for decision of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia.
