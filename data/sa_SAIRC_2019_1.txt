Fair Work Ombudsman v Kang
REPRESENTATION:
Applicant: Mr R
Respondent: Mr D O’Dea
Solicitors:
Applicant: Ralph
Clarke Consulting
Respondent: O’Dea Lawyers
following matters are to be considered in determining the appropriate penalty
for the admitted contraventions on the part of the
employer namely:
The nature and
extent of the conduct leading to the breaches;
circumstances in which the conduct took place;
Loss or damage
to the applicant as a result of the conduct;
Whether the
respondent’s conduct was deliberate;
The size of the
respondent;
respondent’s cooperation, contrition and corrective action;
The need for
specific and general deterrence.
agent for the applicant in his oral submissions discussed the situation that
prevailed herein. The respondent has not accepted
any responsibility or shown
any remorse or contrition for the wrong done to the applicant. Whilst the
respondent was a relatively
small enterprise it nevertheless had as its
principal a duly qualified legal practitioner. The contraventions all occurred
involvement of the principal (Damien O’Dea).
is a significant need for general and specific deterrence in relation to such
contraventions which unfortunately are all too
common in our society. The
respondent did admit the contraventions at the earliest opportunity. It was the
first time that the respondent
had employed anyone.
regards the approach to penalty the authorities establish that the question of
penalty is to be determined as set out below.
first step is to identify the separate contraventions involved. Each
contravention of each separate obligation found in the relevant
Award and the
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth) (FW Act) is a separate contravention of a civil
remedy provision for the purposes of s 539(2) of the FW
557(1) of the FW Act makes provision for treating multiple contraventions of the
same civil remedy provision that result from
a single course of conduct, as a
single contravention.
the extent that two or more contraventions have common elements, this should be
taken into account in considering what an appropriate
penalty is in all the
circumstances for each contravention. The penalties imposed by the Court should
be an appropriate response
to what the respondents
This task is distinct from and
in addition to the final application of the “totality
principle”.
Court should consider an appropriate penalty to impose in respect of each
contravention, (whether a single contravention, a course
of conduct or group of
contraventions), having regard to all of the circumstances of the case.
having fixed an appropriate penalty for each contravention (or, if relevant,
each group of contraventions), the Court should
consider the aggregate penalty,
to determine whether it is an appropriate response to the contravening
The Court should apply an
“instinctive synthesis” in making this
assessment.
This is known as the
totality principle.
circumstances surrounding the employment were somewhat unusual and largely
undocumented which of course has been the subject of
comment in decisions in
relation to civil penalties. Mr Clarke referred to
Fair Work Ombudsman v
where inter alia it was
said that, “The Courts have recognised that proper record keeping
‘is the bedrock of compliance’
with workplace laws ...”
proper records had been kept by the parties then it would be unlikely that the
litigation that has transpired would have eventuated.
find that the following contraventions have occurred:
Contravening a modern award – failure to pay superannuation;
Section 323
Failure to make required payments;
Section 535
Failure to make and keep employee records;
Section 536
Failure to give payslips.
to 1 July 2015 the penalty unit was $170. I would group together the
contraventions in relation to s 45 and s 323. The maximum
penalty is $10,200.
The same maximum applies to s 535 and s 536. The total maximum penalty is
$30,600. Given the circumstances this
is a “crushing penalty”.
would impose a penalty equivalent to 20% of the statutory maximum for each
contravention ($2,040). For three contraventions this
amounts to $6,120.
the totality principle to the total sum I consider that the total penalty should
be $3,900. The employer is Damien O’Dea
trading as O’Dea Lawyers and
it is upon this entity that the penalty is imposed.
order is as follows:
16.1 Pursuant to s 546 (3)(c) of the Act the
pecuniary penalty in the amount of $3,900 is to be paid to the applicant on or
31 July 2019.
16.2 An amount of $120 for unpaid wages is to be paid to the applicant on or
before 31 July 2019.
16.3 An amount of $151 for unpaid superannuation is to be paid to the applicant
on or before 31 July
