ANTI-DISCRIMINATION TRIBUNAL QUEENSLAND
[2009] QADT 10
Complainant
PROCEEDING:
Interlocutory Application
DELIVERED ON:
29 April 2009
DELIVERED AT:
President DA Savage S.C.
HEARING DATES:
On the papers
Respondent file and serve within twenty-one days from the date of this Order its
contentions as to:
(a) whether the Complainant’s factual
contentions (as to his placement in a maximum security unit) are admitted or
(b) whether (notwithstanding any denial of the Complainant’s factual
contentions) upon the facts as contended by the Complainant,
the Respondent
asserts there has been no contravention of the act and why that is asserted;
(c) what relief may be appropriate in the event the Complainant made out
the contravention of the act the subject of the complaint.
Complainant within twenty-eight days after receiving the respondent’s
contentions, file in the Tribunal, and the Tribunal
serve on the Respondents, a
document setting out the following information:
(a) what resources
he requires to meet the contentions made by the Respondent;
(b) what documents and other material he requires to meet such a case and
(c) in what timeframe given those resources and documents he might be able to
prepare his case for a hearing;
(d) how long he estimates that hearing might take.
CATCHWORDS:
Interlocutory application – filing of contentions to isolate the
issues in dispute before interlocutory application can be decided–
anonymity order.
REPRESENTATION:
The complainant is self-represented
Crown Law for the respondent.
complains that the State of Queensland by the Department of Corrective Services
has discriminated against him on the basis of his
sex. The argument advanced is
that he, meeting certain criterion and being male, has been or can be placed in
a maximum security
unit at a Correctional Facility in Queensland. The
Complainant says if he met the same criteria but was female, he would not be
placed in such a unit.
no material filed thus far does the State of Queensland suggest that what X says
of the differing treatments of male and female
prisoners in the State is untrue.
some time now the parties have been at odds over the Complainant’s
interlocutory application to be provided with sufficient
facilities especially
in the form of the provision of a personal computer in his cell and access to
various documents so as to enable
X to prepare the above case.
order to understand the possible issues in such a case so as to intelligently
consider what resources should be made available
to the Complainant, to what
documents the Complainant should have access and how long the Complainant may
need with those documents
and facilities to prepare his case the issues in the
case should first be properly identified and narrowed if possible. To my mind
that will be achieved by directing the Respondent to file and serve within
twenty-one days from the date of this decision its contentions
(a) whether the
Complainant’s factual contentions (as to his placement in a maximum
security unit) are admitted or denied;
(b) whether
(notwithstanding any denial of the Complainant’s factual contentions) upon
the facts as contended by the Complainant,
the Respondent asserts there has been
no contravention of the act and why that is asserted; and
(c) what relief
may be appropriate in the event the Complainant made out the contravention of
the act the subject of the complaint.
the Complainant can see the case which he has to meet, then he will be able to
decide for himself what resources he needs to
meet that particular case, how
long it might take him to prepare that particular case and when he might be able
to present his case
at a hearing.
propose to direct that the Complainant within twenty-eight days after receiving
the respondent’s contentions, inform the
Tribunal as to:
resources he requires to meet the contentions made by the Respondent;
documents and other material he requires to meet such a case and why;
(c) in what
timeframe given those resources and documents he might be able to prepare his
case for a hearing;
(d) how long he
estimates that hearing might take.
the process which I envisage, the Tribunal and the parties will soon be apprised
of how the complaint can now be expeditiously
addressed. If in truth, the
Respondent accepts the factual allegations relevant to the allegation of
discrimination and merely wishes
to contest whether that amounts to the
contravention of the Act the hearing will be a very short one. If the
Respondent wishes to
challenge whether a female inmate would be treated in the
same or substantially the same manner as a male inmate meeting similar
to the Complainant then the hearing may be much longer and might require
reference to several of the classes of documents
to which the Complainant seeks
disclosure. It would also be the type of case where one could not intelligently
expect a person acting
on their own behalf to be able to prepare in other then a
lengthy period and with significant resources. It is not appropriate for
decide those questions until the preliminary steps to isolate the contentious
issues are undertaken. After that I intend to
expedite the hearing of the
matter so far as is convenient to the unrepresented complainant.
parties have accepted there should be an order prohibiting disclosure of the
identity of the Complainant. I am satisfied that
it is proper to make such an
order. Not to do so might expose the Complainant (as he says) to a risk of harm
from other inmates.
propose to assign a member to manage this complaint with a view to according it
an early hearing to the extent that that is able
to be accommodated given the
Complainant’s present position and lack of resources.
